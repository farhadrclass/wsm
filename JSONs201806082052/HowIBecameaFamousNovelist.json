He never really thought about being a novelist until he sees best-selling author Preston Brooks being interviewed on TV. Pete considers said author to be full of shit, but is taken by the adoring young women shown in the audience at the writer's lecture tour:. . . their backs arched forward and their eyes expectant, were rows of college girls. Young women in little sweaters and tight jeans, pliant and needy. Their faces yearned with nameless desire, pleading with Preston to fill them with hard truths.Pete decides to become a famous novelist. He's not concerned with writing a great novel, you understand . . . just a best-selling one. And as we all know, \"best-selling\" does not necessarily mean \"good.\"The financial success of an author is inversely proportional to the literary worth of the book.And so begins Pete's quest. First, the research. After careful study of the New York Times Best Sellers, he compiles a list of rules for writing a best seller. Here are just a few examples:Rule 4: Must include a murder.Rule 9: At dull points include descriptions of delicious meals.Rule 12: Give readers versions of themselves infused with extra awesomeness.Under the influence of questionable pharmaceuticals, Pete cranks out a novel guaranteed to enthrall the \"book-buying saps,\" and actually manages to sell the damned thing to a publisher. Now the big question - will it be a best seller?This was a clever, funny send-up of writers and the publishing industry. In a strange coincidence, last week I happened to win a copy of The Bestseller Code: Anatomy of a Blockbuster Novel, a nonfiction look at writers and the publishing industry. I'm going to have a jolly old time comparing and contrasting, and as I do, I'll keep in mind the words of Pete Tarslaw:\"The hardest thing about writing was picking which words to use.\"Uh-huh."}, {"userName": "MJ Nicholls", "userReviewDate": "Mar 18, 2013", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/2386804-mj-nicholls", "userReview": "An uproarious assault on the sorts of manipulative middlebrow fictions that sit, with smug pastel or pastoral covers, on every highstreet booksellers\u2019 bestsellers shelves and shift enough units to keep real writers impoverished for nine lifetimes.

This book\u2019s got that and more. The most important part of the \"more\" is that it\u2019s very, very funny. It\u2019s a satirical look at the world of books: publishing, promotion, schlock, sensationalism, selling out, and above all, literary pretension. Pete decides that writing a bestseller will be the best way to save face, and to be in-your-face, at his ex-girlfriend\u2019s wedding. He gleans what he can from today\u2019s popular choices, adopts a writer\u2019s lifestyle (in Vermont, no less), and waits for the fame he\u2019s convinced will soon come. I believe the operative phrase is, \u201chilarity ensues\u201d.The thing about satire is that so much can go wrong. It can crane to silly extremes, it can be too obscure, it can miss the intended target, it can be tin-eared, or simply not that funny. But read this List of Bestsellers that Hely used to inspire Pete and see if you don\u2019t agree he got it just about right. (I still laugh at Guess - An economist analyzes the importance of random choices in everything from investments to choosing sushi to professional bull-riding. I\u2019m glad I never got around to writing its equivalent only to see it parodied.)The only reason I\u2019m taking one star away is that he did, for a brief stretch, go a wee bit over the top. I know --- it\u2019s a satire --- he\u2019s allowed to indulge. I was just a little disappointed when his near-perfect pitch seemed slightly sharp at some key moments. Hely (and Pete) were soon back on track, though. Ironically enough, his final irony was satisfying for its lack of cheek. I\u2019m asking you, with all the earnest intention my pre-slacking generation is known for, please read this book. It\u2019s truly a good laugh. If you don\u2019t believe me, wait for my wife to confirm. She\u2019s doped up on Nyquil, but still chuckling at every page. I\u2019m tempted to give back its missing star just for that."}, {"userName": "David", "userReviewDate": "Jul 22, 2009", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/166376-david", "userReview": "This is a sly, often hilarious, satirical takedown of the current publishing scene. An invitation to his former girl friend's wedding pushes Pete Tarslow into an existential funk. He convinces himself that the only way to avoid losing face at the wedding is to become a bestselling author. Based on his examination of the NY Times bestseller lists, he develops a set of rules for writing a blockbuster novel. A few examples illustrate their tongue-in-cheek nature: Rule 1. Abandon truth.Rule 2. Write a popular book. Don't waste energy trying to make it good. Rule 7. Prose should be lyrical.Rule 9. At dull points include descriptions of delicious meals.Rule 15. Must have obscure exotic locations. The first half of the book is given over to Pete's development process for his masterwork, and is by far the best part. Particular highlights include Hely's wickedly imagined fake New York Times bestseller list: http://graphics8.nytimes.com/packages...The descriptions of his process are just as brilliantly on-target:I took out the folded best-seller list from my pocket, this time looking at non-fiction. Anything people liked. I started writing.  World War II. Football. America. The afterlife. Wise lessons learned. Food again. Sex. People accused of crimes they didn't commit. Pursuits. Las Vegas. Natural disasters - earthquakes, tornadoes etc. Gentle humor. Wise old people telling stories. Bargains. Hobos. Bounty hunters. Christmas.  From his outline to \"The Tornado Ashes Club\":  As they dodge bounty hunters, we hear the tale that brought them together, a story of lost love that begins in the hobo camps of the Depression and on mud-stained college football fields, crisscrossing through the fury of World War II France to the islands of the Mediterranean and the kitchens and vineyards of Peru, a saga whose heartbreaking but uplifting end can only come in the swirl of a tornado, sweeping across the milkweed and the bluestem of the prairie on a Christmas morning. Through a series of serendipitous coincidences, \"The Tornado Ashes Club\" actually achieves the blockbuster status Pete has dreamed of. The second half of the book describes what happens next. Although Hely has some fun with the arc of success and decline - set pieces on book fair panel discussions, the Hollywood screen treatment, the seriously high-minded writers' workshop, the high-profile TV interview meltdown, public excoriation in the blogosphere - he doesn't quite match the savage wit of the first half, so that the book coasts to a somewhat perfunctory conclusion. In a previous life, Hely was a writer for David Letterman and Fox's \"American Dad\" series. His novel displays similar strengths and weaknesses to the humor of those shows -- a series of often very clever, funny premises for which the development is somewhat perfunctory, almost as if, after setting up his various gags, the author loses interest. The book is a little bloated at over 300 pages. But the first half contains enough hysterically funny material to justify your giving it a whirl."}, {"userName": "K", "userReviewDate": "Mar 31, 2010", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/13779-k", "userReview": "How to Become a Famous Goodreads Reviewer1. Review a book that lots of people are reading.Really great reviews of obscure books are often wasted efforts; even if you have a long list of devoted friends and followers, these reviews will not get you as much recognition as will reviews of hot, current reads.2. Try to choose a book that has pulled on lots of people's heartstrings, a book which you can then rip as emotionally manipulative and mediocre.The Kite Runner and The Guernsey Literary and Potato Peel Pie Society would be good candidates, although by now the goodreads review industry for these popular titles is probably saturated. But you know what I mean. Exposing books like these as sentimental frauds will get your review a lot of traffic, both from people who cheer you on and from people who take your review personally. If the latter people flame you with nasty comments, others will jump to your defense, hopefully sparking a wide-ranging controversy and bringing you lots of voters.3. Make your review as creative and funny as possible (but try not to be lame).Although an intellectual and thoughtful review will appeal to many and get you some votes, nothing makes you popular on goodreads like a review that cracks people up.Lists like these abound in \"How I Became a Famous Novelist,\" composed by the book's hero, Pete Tarslaw. Pete is a twenty-something loserish guy with a useless degree, a dead-end job, a potential alcohol problem, and a few sympathetic friends. Motivated by dreams of humiliating his ex-girlfriend, Pete decides to write, and actually manages to publish, a mock literary fiction novel. Pete's book makes every literary mistake and shouldn't succeed, but through a series of unlikely events actually does. \"How I Became a Famous Novelist\" is actually not a parody of popular literary fiction in and of itself, but rather, the story of what happens after Pete gets published. \"Famous Novelist\" starts out uproariously funny but becomes more serious after Pete's book gets recognition. Pete ultimately has a change of heart which raises questions for all of us about quality writing and the line between a genuinely touching story and sappy crap. If we think it's crap, does that make it crap? And what about the author's intentions? If we feel the book is crap, does that mean the author was insincere? And is that relevant? \"How I Became a Famous Novelist\" is a good story, but what I loved best was its various parodies of popular writing. From the bestseller list on the back cover (\"The Balthazar Tablet,\" by Tim Drew: The murder of a cardinal leads a Yale professor and an underwear model to the Middle East, where they uncover clues to a conspiracy kept hidden by the Shriners\") to the endorsements on the inside cover (\"'You wish to do more with this book than read it. You must eat it, consume it, make it a part of your physical form, as it is already consuming your mindspace. It must have physical space too. It demands it.' --Susan Freidegger, author of Myopia Dystopia\") to the overwritten excerpts of Pete's book, the parodies kept me chuckling even as the story became more serious. I don't know whether every reader would give this book five stars, but it certainly did the job for me. Even if being this uncritical means I will never get to be a famous goodreads reviewer."}, {"userName": "Jason Pettus", "userReviewDate": "Jul 13, 2009", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/147289-jason-pettus", "userReview": "(Reprinted from the Chicago Center for Literature and Photography [cclapcenter.com:]. I am the original author of this essay, as well as the owner of CCLaP; it is not being reprinted illegally.)Projects of metafiction (for example, books about authors writing books about authors) are notoriously difficult to pull off, simply because of the large circle-jerk factor involved, and the way such a project can easily spiral down into an endless navel-gazing masturbation session; now add the extra complexities of trying to make such a project a wacky comedy, in that by definition such humor is required to be broad and full of stereotypes, and it becomes easy to see why for every Wonder Boys that exists, we also have a thousand Swimming Inside the Suns. But lo and behold, it's actually pulled off by former Letterman writer and Emmy nominee Steve Hely in his 2009 How I Became a Famous Novelist, even more impressive in that this is his debut novel. I have to confess, it had me laughing so hard this week while out at the cafes, I was getting dirty looks from the people at the tables around me; and that's a rare thing for me anymore, something I always take as a good sign. As with all books of this type, it's not going to be for everyone, and for sure a wide swath of you will end up furiously rolling your eyeballs at it no matter how good it is; but for those who occasionally enjoy a well-done comedy that takes the p-ss out of the publishing industry, this will be right up your alley.Because that's what this basically is, a complete and utter indictment of nearly every aspect of the publishing industry, tackled one sector at a time; for, see, the entire thing is seen through the eyes of our \"anti-villain\" main character Pete Tarslaw, a bitter slacker who writes fake college application essays for ignorant rich high-schoolers for a living, and who was born with a natural gift for mimicking the writing styles of others. Pete randomly decides one day that he wants to have a bestselling novel, simply as a way of showing up his ex-girlfriend at her wedding, coming up in another six months; and this is where Hely starts his cynical look at the industry as well, by poking holes in the careers of such bestselling hacks as Dan Brown, Tom Clancy, Mitch Albom and Nora Roberts, not to mention adult-education writing workshops and the tittering female fans of Victorian erotica who populate them. But if this was all the story consisted of, it'd be worthy of not much more than a short at McSweeney's or the like; the book only gets truly brilliant after Tarslaw actually gets the book signed, at which point we enter the world of tired, jaded, pencil-pushing editors at the mercy of their corporate overlords' marketing departments, which serves as just the starting point for the universe of dysfunction Tarslaw enters once his book is actually out.That's the biggest thing I want to emphasize today, that the main reason Famous Novelist works so well is that Hely has a complex understanding of just how the publishing industry works, displaying a wide range of hatred instead of just concentrating on easy targets like so many metafictional comedies do -- by the time the story is over, he has offered up vicious parodies of such diverse character types and institutions as oversexed academes, televangelists who manipulate bestseller lists through their cash-flush congregations, trashy afternoon talk shows designed for New Age soccer moms, earthy Vermont lesbians, Brooklyn-dwelling hipster douchebags, the Iowa Writers Workshop, Entertainment Weekly, product placement specialists, the ABA BookExpo, and pretentious non-producing MFA students, not to mention such easily recognizable real people as Lindsay Lohan, Harvey Weinstein, Barbara Walters, James Frey, Michiko Kakutani, Harriet Klausner, Jessa Crispin, Miss Snark, and yes, yours truly*. And that's the real key to a book-length metafictional comedy working, is that Hely makes his skewering both expansive and specific, not only working hard to come up with as much stuff to parody as possible, but making many of these parodies so obscure that only the truly dedicated will get them, even while leaving in enough broad references to Stephen King and Danielle Steele that a general audience can enjoy it too.But the final key to Famous Novelist being so successful is something almost the opposite of all this, and is why so many metafiction projects end up falling flat on their face, which is that Hely injects a healthy dose of sincerity and heart into the story as well, ironically showing us by the end why storytelling is so important to society in the first place; and in a twist so ingenious that I wanted to jump out of my chair and scream \"FREAKING BRILLIANT!,\" Hely accomplishes this through an episode of Oprah, using a premise typical of her show as an entirely snot-free example of why people bother reading books to begin with, despite the thousand headaches and fools he just got done describing in the 300 pages previous. Certainly a metafictional project doesn't need to have such a non-ironic element in order to be a success, but certainly Famous Novelist is much better than other such novels for it, and is the detail that will have you continuing to think about this book long after you're done reading it.Now, make no mistake, an author can only get away with one book like this in their career, and it's still to be seen whether Hely has the chops to write another novel this solid once getting away from highly gimmicky concepts; but at least this book is nearly perfect for what it aims to be, high praise from a guy who usually can't stand such self-referential tomes. It comes highly recommended to my fellow erudite book lovers, and especially those so mired in the industry that they will get all of the dozens and dozens of jokey references made within.Out of 10: 9.4*Well, okay, he doesn't mention me specifically; but he does have this whole brilliant rant about nihilistic, overeducated, self-hating litbloggers who maintain websites with arcane and meaningless names, a category I fit into as snugly as a hand into a glove."}, {"userName": "Lee", "userReviewDate": "Mar 19, 2013", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/90786-lee", "userReview": "Funniest thing I've read in a while.

So many funny similes, asides, setups. And just when you think it's becoming too jaded/sarcastic, there's a change of heart. Lightly touches on themes of sincerity and authenticity. Loved the execution of the formulaic novel form (pathetic guy motivated by pathetic lovelorn urges concocts pathetic/brilliant plan, goes from rags to riches, but not without consequences or learning something true). Loved authorial attention to narrator's likeability. Loved how it plays by its own explicitly stated rules for writing a bestseller -- for example, including specific meals at specific restaurants in as many cities as possible that include likely readers, or having parts in cars because people listen to audiobooks while driving.

The crazed desperation exhibited by the editor character may seem like a cartoonish exaggeration, but will ring true to anyone who reads industry blogs.

These parodies are executed with such precision that, despite their absurdity, they seem completely real. \"How I Became a Famous Novelist\" is a light read, certainly, but it isn't fluff.

In the end, Pete realizes the truth about good writing (it can't be manufactured) and the book publishing industry.My ThoughtsI can't see why anyone who likes to read wouldn't want to check out this hilariously funny, spot-on satire of popular fiction. I was cracking up throughout the book. Mr. Hely's jokes and parodies are spot-on\u2014from the fictional Entertainment Weekly review to excerpts from his \"novel\" to his skewering of pop author stereotypes. (If Pamela McLaughlin isn't based on Patrica Cornwell, I'll eat an entire pack of Thin Mints by myself.) There are so many good parts that I could do an entire review with just excerpts. But that would probably be illegal in some way so I'll settle with just a few.Being lazy about research: I had no intention of spending my nights on ride-alongs with homicide cops, or mapping magical empires and populating them with orcs.On literary fiction: But becoming a professor called for a particular kind of book, a \"literary\" book. These books can be identified in two ways. One: at the end of a work of literary fiction, you're supposed to feel weirdly sad, and perhaps cry, but not for any clear reason. Two: The word \"lyrical\" appears on the back cover of literary fiction.On reviewing his work: That night, after a dinner of leftover salmon, I reviewed the work I'd done. A lot was garbage. There were strange repetitions. The word taciturn was used four times in one sentence. Genevieve was thrice described as robin-throated. The Black Hills were said to \"rise from the land like the calluses and corns and warts from God's own foot.\"On guessing the plot of Preston Brook's new novel: I played a game of trying to imagine what new heights of sentimentality and emotional prostitution he'd reached: little children going to look for long-lost brothers with hobo satchels over their shoulders. Two orphans falling in love and trying to raise a child the way they'd wished they'd been raised. A veterinarian who travels the country healing the hearts of old worn-out dogs. But my wildest flights of shamelessness could not outdo the Master. Preston Brooks's new book was called The Widows' Breakfast. Amazing, right there. He'd beaten me with the title alone. But the subject was five widows-yes, one of them was black. They meet in 1942, when their husbands are all training to be pilots in World War II. And starting in that year, they have a tradition of getting together for breakfast on the morning after the funeral, anytime one of their husbands dies.If any of these excerpts or the rules of a successful book excerpt made you smile, I'm here to tell you that there is TONS MORE of this in the book. This is a comedy goldmine (as it should be as Hely is ones of the writers for the very funny sitcom 30 Rock). If you don't read it, you're just missing out on the best satire I've read in ages. Seriously, you need to read this book.My RecommendationThere is just no way to go wrong with this book! It is laugh-out-loud funny satire of popular fiction and publishing. C'mon, what more could you, as a lover of books, want? Unless you are so reverent about books that you cannot bear to have them made fun of, I think this book would make you laugh. I loved it and recommend it wholeheartedly. Just remember: Take nothing seriously. It is all fake, but there were times when I got totally sucked in because the parodies are just so spot-on. I'm giving it 4.5 stars. I guarantee you'll never look at the best-seller list quite the same way again. And you have to love an author who goes to the trouble of creating a fake web site and fake blog for his fake author's fake book."}, {"userName": "Lena", "userReviewDate": "Aug 23, 2009", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/220791-lena", "userReview": "This book is an exceedingly funny send-up of the various problems with modern publishing.

Realizing that writing a plotty thriller is \"exhausting,\" he decides to write a literary novel since \"with literary fiction, you can just cover everything up with a coat of wordy spackle.\" He comes up with a book called \"The Tornado Ashes Club,\" which is about man falsely accused of murder who drives off across America with his grandmother in order to find a tornado and release his grandfather's ashes into it (or something). The book also includes WWII flashbacks, researched from Wikipedia. We're given a brief excerpt of Tarslaw's prose:In strewn banners that lay like streamers from a long ago parade, the sun's fading seraphim rays gleamed onto the hood of the old Ford and ribboned the steel with the meek orange of a June tomato straining at the vine. From the back seat, door open, her nimble fingers moved along the guitar like a weaver's on a loom. Stitching a song. The cloth she made was a cry of aching American chords, dreamlike warbles built to travel miles of lonesome road. They faded into the twilight, and Silas leaned back on the asphalt, as if to watch them drift into the Arkansas mist.As someone who has read literally reams of similar drivel, I found Hely's observations about how to write a bestselling literary novel (based on insights gleaned from a spot-on satire of the NYT bestseller list) absolutely hilarious. Tarslaw's whole cynical attitude towards writing is also a funny contrast to the platitudes offered up in defense of literary fiction.Writing a novel--actually picking the words and filling in paragraphs--is a tremendous pain in the ass. Now that TV's so good and the Internet is an endless forest of distraction, it's damn near impossible. That should be taken into account when ranking the all-time greats. Somebody like Charles Dickens, for example, who had nothing better to do except eat mutton and attend public hangings, should get very little credit.The fun here is in Tarslaw's perverted yet totally accurate worldview; the plot seems more or less beside the point.

Giving up on that, he used his thoughts as fuel for his character's aspirations to get famous in time to show up his ex-girlfriend at her wedding. His other book so far (The Amazing Race or something like that) was just a stunt to get a publisher to pay for the around-the-world trip. I also got the feeling that he used tricks to extend the novel to hit the 300-page mark...such as inserting blank pages between chapters to ensure that each chapter began on the right-side page, and included many excerpts from fake works mentioned in the novel that usually ran over a page. He also overused the bullet pointed list, disrupting the narrative. It somehow reminded me of the style of Bridget Jones's Diary but much less sincere.Yes, it's a gimmick novel about gimmick novel-writing, so it could've been \"so meta\" or ironic, but mostly felt insincere to me. He certainly was good at inhabiting his character in trying to justify his despicable behavior to the reader, but it all felt very false and insincere despite the fact that his character was false and insincere."}, {"userName": "Trin", "userReviewDate": "Mar 05, 2009", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/113980-trin", "userReview": "Hilarious send-up of the current literary \u201cscene.\u201d Hely\u2019s protagonist, Pete Tarslaw, concludes, not unreasonably, that most acclaimed novelists are just big faking fakers who fake, from the James Patterson thriller types to the earnest, sappy Nicholas Sparkses.

In composing the fictional memoir of first-time novelist and literary scandal-monger Pete Tarslaw, comedy writer Steve Hely finds ways to gleefully skewer all forms of literary genre and pretension. The spoof New York Times Bestseller List (linked to in the Amazon Best of the Month Review above) is a classic in its own right and sets much of the tone for the whole book. Tarslaw's determination to impress his ex-girlfriend by establishing himself as a famous author in time for her upcoming wedding creates the main trajectory for the novel. The pace is brisk. The laughs come thick and fast. (If you enjoy books by Ben Elton or Mil Millington, then this is definitely one for you.) On occasion, Tarslaw's attitude and observations became too snide and snarky for my liking. But Hely has created a highly entertaining book--a fake memoir with a lot of sad truths about the current state of the book publishing industry."}, {"userName": "Mykle", "userReviewDate": "Jul 23, 2009", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/614862-mykle", "userReview": "OMG!

The comic timing starts out good and gets better and better. The send-ups of recent bestsellers may seem dated in another ten years but right now they are like comedy crack. And then, folded into this bundle of snark, cynicism, binge drinking and general bad behavior is a vicious denunciation of the vapidity and blockbusterism of the bestseller list.Highly recommended for writers, publishers, and booksellers on the upper floors of large chain bookstores in major east coast cities.

This might be book the book review, though, that exposes me for the literary elitist I am.This is the book that I want to be required reading. There are a few books I feel this way about: To Kill a Mockingbird, Fahrenheit 451. Forget banning books; Literally force people to read this book. Make a book report mandatory as part of credit card applications. Force the masses to prove they\u2019ve read these books before they\u2019re allowed to have internet access. Include literature tests along with drug tests when applying for a job, or at the very least, before running for political office.Most of the books I include in these rants are the well-known classics that teach something about social and economic issues in our world; something of which I feel people should be aware before they go around sharing opinions, or, God forbid, voting. But the issues Steve Hely deals with are not economic or even social; they are literary.Narrator Pete Tarslaw decides to become a famous novelist so he can upstage an ex-girlfriend at her wedding, which is probably as good of a reason to write as any. Besides, he\u2019s got loads of experience in professional bullshitting, thanks to his day job manufacturing academic essays for students who are just as slacking as he. His redeeming quality is that he is probably the most observant bastard ever to walk the earth, which is what allows him to succeed at his lofty goal\u2013 and what allows the reader to benefit from his literary endeavors.Tarslaw dives head-first into the incestuous and phony world of big publishing. From the formulaic plotting of his path to success to an Adderal binge in the woods to the dinner with the desperately confused publishing professionals. The genius\u2013 or disappointment\u2013 or this book is that it is so hilarious, so entertaining, that a reader could fail to realize how poignant it is. Hely hits the nail on the head, exposing an industry so desperate to turn a profit that it has no qualms about presenting the work of a professional plagiarist as fine literature.This book comes highly recommended, not only for its merit as a lesson in contemporary literature, but also because it accomplishes merely as a footnote what most books set out with as their primary objective: It entertains. The difference between this book and the ones it criticizes, however, is that those cookie-cutter novels exist only as a diversion, as way to spend time; How I Became a Famous Novelist exists to say something of value, but refuses to waste your time while doing it.

Hely has written for David Letterman and has a dry, sharp wit.2. If anyone can write a rollicking satire of the publishing world, this is the guy.3. Hely's protagonist, Pete Tarslaw, is an underemployed, underwashed liberal arts slacker who cooks up the idea of becoming a famous novelist to make his soon-to-be-married ex-girlfriend jealous. Could there be a worse reason to go into writing? If so, I have yet to see it.4. In preparation for his opus, Tarslaw atomizes the genres and conventions of today's bestsellers and literary prize winners with striking clarity. He makes a lot of lists.5. Tarslaw's Rule 5: \"Must include a club, secrets/mysterious missions, shy characters, characters whose lives are changed suddenly, surprising love affairs, women who've given up on love but turn out to be beautiful.\"6. \"The Tornado Ashes Club,\" Tarslaw's novel, is designed to bring joy to lonely middle-aged women who devour baked goods. That's almost how things turn out.7. That Hely can keep readers from throwing the book against the wall while reading Tarslaw's calculatedly awful prose is a significant achievement, facilitated by his decision to keep such passages very, very short.8. Hely, by contrast, writes taut, funny sentences, such as: \"Writing a novel is pathetic and boring. Anyone sensible hates it. It's all you can do to not play Snood all afternoon.\"9. As almost every aspect of publishing -- bespectacled young literary geniuses (Jonathan Safran Foer, anybody?), the post-publication influence of Oprah -- gets satirized, true insiders may wonder about who escapes unscathed: notably, powerful agents. Perhaps Hely's is too big to annoy.10. I found this entirely charming, but I am a book geek. Then again, who knew about the Westminster Kennel Club before \"Best in Show\"?11.

He hasn\u2019t read a book in years. In \u201cHow I Became a Famous Novelist,\u201d Tarslaw decides not only to turn his life around by writing a book, but to make a ton of money doing it by unlocking the tricks of successful novel writing.

One look at his mock NYT Bestseller List will have you rolling on the floor, or snorting up water on the subway while getting dirty/jealous looks from fellow passengers.Protagonist Pete Tarslaw is a conscienceless yet likeable underachiever that happens to have a knack for writing by the rules. He makes a living taking unreadable admissions essays written by foreigners and crafting them into well-written, formulaic, trope-y packages. Until the news that his college girlfriend, Polly, is getting married awakens him to his mediocrity, and he vows to avenge himself by becoming a famous novelist by her wedding day. Pete's \"research\" into the James Freys, the Dan Browns, the Nicholas Sparks' of the literary world is so dead-on accurate that it will bowl you over. Hely also blew me away in his crafting of a protagonist: self-absorbed, horrible at times, yet hilariously, devilishly endearing. What truly really makes the book work, though, is that it offers us more than a nihilistic rejection of writing for money. Ultimately, Hely gives us a story of growth without forcing our biting, honest protagonist to swallow a \"lesson learned\" pill.
