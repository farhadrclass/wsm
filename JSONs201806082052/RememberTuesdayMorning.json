I have very mixed feelings on this book.While I enjoyed it from the perspective that it is a clean, Christian, enjoyable piece of action-filled fiction, I also had some issues with it.This is only the second book by Kingsbury I have read, but I am getting a distinct impression: Kingsbury is good at writing Christian themes, she's good at writing suspense\\action, she is good at writing emotion, she is good at writing clean content, but somehow, as a whole, her books just really . . . lack. The first one I read was very \"meh\", and this one was the same. Just kind of left you with an \"Hm. Well that happened.\" Rather disappointing. But, while this was disappointing on some levels, there was a fair bit about it I did like. The characters were all enjoyable. Alex was . . . um, depressed. I struggle to relate to and understand the depressed, \"nobody could ever love me\" type characters, perhaps because I am such a happy person. All in all though, his struggle was realistic, and his character arc was fairly well done. I think my favorite character was his girlfriend. I wished there was more with her POV! I could really relate to her character. Jamie and Clay were also fantastic! I love the older, mentor-type characters. It took me a few chapters to really get into the story, but once I did, I just wanted to keep reading. The climax, of course, happened late at night, so I stayed up past 11 pm to finish it. I loved the whole police officer element - I love stories with emergency personnel as the main characters. And the whole K9 aspect was definitely fascinating. I think what really bothered me most about this book was Kingsbury's writing style: it's very minimalistic in regards to punctuation, and such, which frustrated this Comma Queen. While yes, a lot of it was stylistic, and just more the way I'm used to thing\\like things, there were a few instances where comma rules dictate a comma, and there wasn't a comma. Commas are dying an unnatural death, and I don't like it. Who cares about saving the planet? Save the commas, people! But anyway, overall, this book just didn't really cut it for me. If you are looking for a clean, thriller read, with strong Christian themes, then definitely give this a try.CONTENT NOTE: The main character is a police officer, so there are various issues portrayed throughout, such as driving under the influence, arson, gun play, death, violence, and a few characters get trapped by a wildfire. For those reasons, and for somewhat deep subject matter, not recommended for anyone under the age of 15."}, {"userName": "Krystal", "userReviewDate": "Mar 16, 2009", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/1196747-krystal", "userReview": "Perhaps I am getting a bit cynical....I usually love Karen Kingsbury's books. However, I have noticed an annoying trend in the majority of them: Boy and girl meet in elementary/middle/high school and fall MADLY in love Boy and girl are separated by some terrible twist of fate Boy and girl lose each other and their faithFASTFORWARD 5-10 years Boy and girl are living separate lives FAR from their hometown...but oddly within blocks of each other Everyone they know is a Christian, living a perfect life, and praying for them BAM! Another tragedy strikes. However, this time it has the power to both immediately restore their faith in God AND somehow, inexplicably, drive boy and girl back together Boy and girl find that despite the huge passage of time, they are still MADLY in love and will never love anyone else Boy and girl get married and live happily ever afterSubstitute different names and/or tragic events and I have just described the plot (or subplot) of virtually EVERY Karen Kingsbury book ever written."}, {"userName": "Laura", "userReviewDate": "Oct 01, 2009", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/1933343-laura", "userReview": "I thoroughly enjoyed the 9/11 series by Karen Kingsbury. The first two books One Tuesday Morning and Beyond Tuesday Morning -- were fabulous. Of all the Kingsbury books I have read, these were the best in terms of story line, quality and well-developed characters. While Every Now and Then was quite good, it was not as strong as the first two in this series. A somewhat typical level of Kingsbury predictability made it less interesting to read, and I found myself more frustrated with the main character, Alex, then attached to him.Do not let this comparison deter you from reading this book, though. There was still a strong message, and I walked away from the book with a revitalized, even profound, sense that I can only control myself and cannot control the evil in the world beyond me. I am that Mom who worries daily about her children's safety, even in small town USA. This book reminded me to find peace in God's control of all circumstances, even those that are tragic. To this end, and person who needs to be reminded of this message should read and absorb the message in this book."}, {"userName": "Lauren", "userReviewDate": "Mar 03, 2009", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/1569148-lauren", "userReview": "Not my favorite Karen Kingsbury novel, I didn't find Alex's story as powerful as the first two 9/11 novels. The other hit home and where very powerful. Alex was a character I just couldn't find myself liking. I'm not exactly sure why I couldn't like him, but I just felt no sympathy for him. Oh well, I am looking forward to reading Karen Kingsbury's other series, especially the famed Baxter family novels."}, {"userName": "Annette Moore", "userReviewDate": "Sep 13, 2015", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/42780898-annette-moore", "userReview": "Interestingly, of the three books in this series, this one has to be my favorite. I absolutely loved Alex's story! I love reading books where the main character, like Alex, is broken, hurting, and without hope, but who, in the end, finds god's relentless love and redemption through friends who also relentlessly love him and who don't give up on him.I also love and appreciate the theme of this story--how we can't eliminate the evil in the world, but we can do something about the evil in our own hearts.Without going into a lot of detail or spoiling the story for anyone who may wish to read it, this was a very emotionally gripping novel--very suspenseful in parts, as well. I would most definitely reread it--and may reread the entire series again in a few years. for those of you who enjoy a heart-stopping romance, there's that, too."}, {"userName": "Emma Brunswick", "userReviewDate": "Feb 17, 2015", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/36375873-emma-brunswick", "userReview": "I would give the book \"Every Now and Then\" five out of five stars. This book is the third book of the 9/11 series by Karen Kingsbury. I like this book because it has tons of action and involves Christianity too. This book is about a K9 deputy with his dog Bo. He has to learn to love again after he lost his father on 9/11. This book like many of Karen's other books are suspenseful and makes you want to keep reading. The characters I mentioned before are not in the other two. However, the characters from the other two books are still involved in this story as well. The book is easy to understand and is a decent book level. These are the reasons why I gave this book five stars."}, {"userName": "Emily Brunswick", "userReviewDate": "Nov 03, 2014", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/36408560-emily-brunswick", "userReview": "I totally give this book five out of five stars. If it was possible to give it infinity number of stars, that's how many stars I would give it. That's how much i loved this book.I gave this book five stars, because it was very easy to read, and it was very action filled. It is about Alex Brady, a canine deputy and his dog Bo. I liked this book, because it switched perspectives every chapter, so you were able to know all of the main characters thoughts and feelings throughout the whole book. What makes it better is that it is a Christian book, so it has bible verses throughout the book, and the main characters use God and prayer to get through there huge problems and conflicts. Alex and Bo are rated the top canine group, and they fight many hard crimes together, that other deputies and their dogs could not survive through. All of Alex's life revolves around his dog and his job. Through prayer from other people Alex finally tries to go go back to who he was before 9/11. If you love action, I recommend this book to you."}, {"userName": "Denise", "userReviewDate": "Feb 22, 2009", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/1579441-denise", "userReview": "***EXTREME SPOILER ALERT***I have read many of Karen Kingsbury's books and loved them and recommend them. She writes Christian Fiction with a reality that is plausible and applicable to your life.However, this book was not like the others, including the first two in this 9/11 series. It was overly predictable, rushed ending and extremely sad. The author puts a dog on the cover, spends almost the entire book describing the relationship between the police officer and his K-9 partner, graphically (and I mean graphically!!! for anyone who has lost a furry friend, you'll understand) depicts his death and then spends no time at all except for a brief funeral describing any grief associated with the death of him.

However, I really enjoyed reading how the main character, Alex, was able to heal from the loss of his firefighter father on 9/11. The process of God drawing him back to Him felt realistic.

This is so true. It's touching to me how much He really does care about each individual and giving them comfort and peace no matter their trial. This book reminded me of that old song, \"This world is not my home. I'm just a passing through.\" We aren't here to try to make this world a perfect place. Comfort in this life is an extra because it is not what we should be living for. Our mansion is in heaven, in a perfect place where wind or storm or wicked men cannot harm it like happens to our treasures here. Everything and everyone we have here could be gone in an instant. \"Lay not up for yourselves treasures on earth were moth and rust doth corrupt and where thieves break through an steal, but lay up for yourselves treasure in heaven where neither moth nor rust doth corrupt and where thieves do not break through and steal.\" Our goals on this earth should be for laying up those treasures and doing everything in our power to make sure that our loved one's will be there to share them with us. This life is just a drop in the bucket compared to eternity. I liked her spiritual applications.On the downside, though this may be totally rooted in personal preference, this book probably wouldn't have gotten me through the first chapter if I had been depending on the intrigue to make me sit down and read it in an actual book form. As it was, I had it on audio CD. So, I played it on my walkman while I had a day to spend cooking. It was enjoyable to listen to while I was doing something else, but it wouldn't, like other books have, make me so curious that I would be willing to sit down and \"waste\" my time when there were other things I could be doing. This is a definitely a romance, no mystery, and very little action. There is some at the end for those that enjoy light action, but most of it is thinking, considering, and focusing on inner struggles. I enjoyed the scenes where the people we interacting and doing something. Still, even those were few and far between. This would be good for those that enjoy a light read."}, {"userName": "Bethany", "userReviewDate": "Jul 02, 2011", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/5728202-bethany", "userReview": "I am a Christian. I believe what John 3:16 says. I go to church every Sunday. I am raising my daughter in this faith. That being said I can't stand most Christian Fiction. With the exception of Ted Dekker and Frank Peretti, it all seems very fake. It's like a fairy tale, it always seems to have a happy ending. I am here to tell you folks, there have been periods in my life where there was no happy ending. So I do not want to read sappy love songs disguised as christian fiction.Because of this I have never really been able to get into most Karen Kingsbury books until I found this series, the 9/11 series. The first two were amazing. They made me laugh, cry, and scream right along with the characters in the story. This book had a more solemn feel too it. It was about dealing with bitterness towards God in the aftermath of tragedy.The main character Alex has pretty much cut off everyone he ever loved from his life. He has bitterness toward God for not sparing his Dad, a FDNY firefighter, during the 9/11 attacks. He has decided that if God isn't going to protect people from evil it is his job, and becomes a K9 officer for the LAPD.This is a book you can read without having read the first two. It mentions the characters from the other books, in fact they play a huge part in the story. But this is not just a continuance from the other two books, it is wholly Alex's story. This book hit me at the heart of the matter. It showed me how much I try to do God's job in my own life. It also has a love story intertwined in it, that speaks to the heart of every grieving person. This is not just a christian fairy tale, it could have been anyone who was over the age of 10, almost 10 years ago. It felt real and was written with the grieving heart in mind.Mrs. Kingsbury did a wonderful job, and has found a place on my ever multiplying bookshelf."}, {"userName": "Katie", "userReviewDate": "Oct 25, 2009", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/2605475-katie", "userReview": "I read this book first in the series. I wish I kept an eye more about when books belong in series. I always mistakenly read the last one first! I really need to work on that...I thought that Kingsbury did an excellent storytelling of the terrible tragedy of 9/11 which occurred over eight years ago. This is still a touchy subject for those who have lived through it and heartwrenching to hear the details over and over. The main character, Alex, was hardened and stubborn from the effect of his father being killed on 9/11. His character internally died that day and shut down. He became very focused on becoming a sheriff in California to lock up the bad guys and protect society.Kingsbury did a wonderful job of incorporating scripture and correlating it to how Alex came to see how he wasn't able to prevent every tragedy.The ending was beautiful as Holly and Alex came back together and were married. The vows were truthful and thought-provoking. I may have even shed a tear! The book really made me relate to having my husband as a firefighter and not knowing if he is safe all the time or if he'll come home. But I'm proud of him and know that God is with us both. I only had one complaint about the ending. Alex and Holly originally make up in the vet's office and at that point it seems that Alex will never let Holly go again. But it fast forwards to 3-4 days later at Bo (or Beau)'s funeral, and Alex hadn't contacted Holly at all. It was inconsistent to how Alex's character had transformed that big night.Overall, great book.

I felt that too much time and detail was spend on useless things, such as her in depth details of the freeways/streets. Do I really need to know that Alex turned right off the Ventura freeway onto a Jones Street and then left over a hill, to lead to the second house on the left?! Also, I found it frustrating that it took 3/4 of the way through the book for Alex and Holly to finally meet up! Lastly, I enjoyed the last 6 chapters or so, as the climax of the story finally came into place and the resolution was made...however, I feel like it was overly drawn out through the book and found myself bored with all the incessive details.
