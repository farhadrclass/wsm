The novel focuses on the Welsh family - Joe, a good, trustful but troubled man, who struggles with insecurity and alcoholism; his wife, Rita, who does what she can to make the best of their marriage, and the rebellious daughter, Adele, whose bouts of anger often serve as a curtain to hide real feelings for her family. Richards has been often categorized as a regional, \"Maritime\" writer - which is not a drawback, and is one of the reasons I come to read his work in the first place - but experiences of his characters defy regional boundaries and categorizations; there exists an universal language of human emotion, and essence along with character of the region only add to it, instead of defining it. I believe that there also exists a universal language of human poverty - but this one is most often heard in fictional works on blue collar workers in the poor and depressed communities of the developed and undeveloped world, such as this book. In this case, as in the words of Truman Capote, \"fiction is the truth inside the lie\".This isn't a perfect book - the storyline is fragmented and there isn't really a plot to speak of - but I do not regret reading it, and I intend to read the following novels which are set in the same region, and more of Richards in general."}, {"userName": "Troy Parfitt", "userReviewDate": "Jan 30, 2012", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/5063159-troy-parfitt", "userReview": "If you're looking for an introduction to David Adams Richards, Nights Below Station Street ought to do. It's a compelling, prettily written little tale that clocks in at 226 pages. Set in the Miramachi in New Brunswick, Canada, it deals with the lives of Joe and Rita Walsh, their daughters Adele and Milly, and their friends, acquaintances, neighbours, and enemies. Richards shows us the universal through the particular, rural New Brunswick supplying a stage that is just as authentic as Stratford Upon Avon. The characters mightn't be eloquent knights or nobles, but their words, deeds, concerns, and situations resonate as powerfully. This is a stirring little yarn waiting to teleport you to another time and place - and it's got an interesting ending. Nights Below Station Street is part one of what has become known as the Mirimachi Trilogy. Evening Snow Will Bring Such Peace and For Those Who Hunt the Wounded Down make for volumes two and three of that trilogy. Nights Below Station Street is a nice read."}, {"userName": "Darren Tang", "userReviewDate": "Mar 10, 2016", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/4923368-darren-tang", "userReview": "If this book was a girl at a party, she wouldn't be the boisterous, boringly talkative, tell-you-her-life-story type. She would be the shy, quiet one sitting in the background who spent her entire night talking to one person. Just that one person. She wouldn't be wearing flashy shoes, or a nice top; but her clothes would smell real soft-like, fresh out of the dryer. And at the end of the night, not knowing whether you would see her again, you would wonder how such an overwhelmingly underwhelming person could draw you in so close. Secretly cherishing your last moments together, you would depart with a fine appreciation for everything discussed; and with a sense of gratitude that you indeed came across someone that had so much to say, but that could have easily been missed had you not been paying attention to what they had to offer."}, {"userName": "Carlos Gazo", "userReviewDate": "Jun 02, 2017", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/65740623-carlos-gazo", "userReview": "Governor General\u2019s award winner David Adams Richard\u2019s writes a spectacular book that takes place in small mill town in northern New Brunswick, it focuses on a family that has problems just like everyone else. Joe Walsh, the man of the house, is isolated and is very much facing a drinking problem, His wife Rita is very kept to herself and tries to keep the family together even though she has a rebellious daughter. Adele, full of rage is often hiding her feelings from her family. As much as Adele is stubborn and wants to get rid of her parents at times, all their lives rely on having each other and staying strong to live in their community. This family always believes and proves that they have the strength to work together and face whatever comes their way. Joe Walsh being the man of the house is a big alcoholic. Problems tend to find Walsh wherever he goes. Walsh's family knows he needs help and that he has a problem that only he can change if he really wants it. I personally recommend this book to students around the age of 17 and older for it can make younger readers uncomfortable. Readers will also start to understand more about poverty and struggles in a town that faces lots of issues. I really loved this book because I felt that I related to more than one issue in this book which made it easier to understand the feelings and thoughts the characters had in the novel."}, {"userName": "Bill", "userReviewDate": "Apr 23, 2016", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/4380068-bill", "userReview": "Nights Below Station Street by David Adams Richards is the first book in Canadian author Richards' Miramichi trilogy. For those who don't know, the Miramichi is a river in New Brunswick Canada that flows into the Miramichi Bay and thence into the Gulf of St Lawrence. From a personal perspective, I lived there for seven years of my youth while my father was stationed at the RCAF Base at Chatham, near the mouth of the river. So there you've got that picture in your mind now. :0))The story tells of Joe, Rita and their children, Adele and Molly and also of their friends and acquaintances. I won't say the story is necessarily a happy one; Joe is an alcoholic with feelings of deep insecurity; Rita married Joe as a sort of last chance when she gets pregnant by another man; Adele is a teenager who loves / hates her family and friends, tries to fit in but doesn't know how; Molly is a hyper-active child. Their friends also deal with their own issues; Myhrra, trying to raise a boy; I think loves Joe but marries Vye. The old doctor, Hennessy, who can't tell his true feelings and is a curmudgeon. Ralphie, in love with Adele, but subject of her anger and trying to live up to his mother's wishes and also to be accepted by his sister. The story is a series of vignettes, lovingly crafted, with a clear picture of the people and the actions. My main problem with the story was that I found it difficult to warm to these people, but that was probably because my life experience was very different. As the story progressed, I did find myself being drawn into their lives and wanting things to work out and for them to come together. Unfortunately, the story does leave you hanging somewhat, but with maybe hope for their future. It did make me want to find the next book in the trilogy; Evening Snow Will Bring Such Peace.

The more I think about it, the more I like it. It didn't take me 2 months to read this book! It was a very quick read actually; it's just that Christmas got \"in the way.\" Anyway, I very much enjoy David Adams Richards' style of writing. It's so descriptively quirky:\"The largeness of her face, and the bigness of her feet, and the self-important strides she made whenever she walked, filled the doctor, who wore his red bow-tie, with compassion.And wry:\"Nevin hadn't read anything but because he grew a beard everyone assumed he had.\"And wise:\"The only thing was, that in everyone who presumed because of drink that they had suddenly become authentic, Joe saw himself.\"I've heard Richards described as Canada's own Thomas Hardy and I can see why some have said that but he embraces humour in a way that Hardy doesn't. There's a moose hunting scene that had me chuckling out loud in the doctor's office.I've also heard it said that Richard's is \"overrated\" and I have to disagree. In my opinion, no one else writes quite this way. I'm keen to read the other books on my shelf, particularly the one that picks up some threads of Nights Below Station Street--although it's not actually a sequel--Evening Snow Will Bring Such Peace."}, {"userName": "Corinne Wasilewski", "userReviewDate": "Mar 12, 2013", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/7149522-corinne-wasilewski", "userReview": "This is classic David Adams Richards with a cast of characters struggling to survive in a harsh, uncaring world with little money, work, and zero joy. DAR books always tear at my guts. I swing between anger, compassion, and despair. I cringe at his characters' helplessness and their easy acceptance that this is the way life has to be. I wanted to give Joe just one encouraging word. I wanted to say, \"Hey, big guy! Hang in there. You're doing great!\" I wanted to give Rita a pair of pants with a zipper that works. I wanted to kidnap Adele and get her out of that hellhole before it swallowed her whole. I wanted to kick each and every character's backside and tell him/her to grow up and get a life.  This isn't my favourite DAR book -- it's very dark with only glimmers of light, but, definitely worth the read."}, {"userName": "Lance Kinzer", "userReviewDate": "May 11, 2013", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/9570914-lance-kinzer", "userReview": "\"An object falls, it has no idea where it will land, but at every moment of its descent it is exactly where it is supposed to be.\" This line toward the end of the book encapsulates the main theme of this interesting work. Adams begins with a too forced staccato style that so many writers over the last 50 years seem to favor. A style that perhaps once seemed fresh and honest, but has grown stale and contrived. Adams is at his best when he forgets this affectation (which he often does); only then does the story really take off. And an interesting story it is. A story about isolation and loss and insecurity, and misunderstanding and being misunderstood. And yet with an unmistakable note of redemption that is not forced in any way, but grows naturally from a compelling narrative."}, {"userName": "Daniel Kukwa", "userReviewDate": "Aug 22, 2015", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/3885089-daniel-kukwa", "userReview": "Strangely, I find this novel -- one of David Adams Richards' earliest -- to be one of his most depressing. Everyone seems to be trapped in a personal hell of their own making, and even the final redemption/gleam of hope at least one character usually finds by the end of a Richards' novel seems tiny compared to his later works. Very bleak, and very despondent...but I can't deny the power of the prose, which keeps one reading in spite of the bleakness, determined to make it to the conclusion, hoping against hope that a single ray of positive sunshine will envelop at least one of the characters. Compelling, but terribly (almost beautifully) sad."}, {"userName": "Jeff Arbeau", "userReviewDate": "Dec 11, 2014", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/33303515-jeff-arbeau", "userReview": "A must read for every Maritimer (and non-Maritimer) during the winter months. This novel is powerful, subtle, and intuitively familiar in its presentation of poverty, alcoholism, and the families that build our rural communities. This is my second reading of Nights Below Station Street, and I am sure I will return to its pages again some day while lost in the cold, dark wood. Richards has found a way to locate parts of our lives and present them to us in characters who persist and survive.

This novel jumped from character to character throughout, confusing me for the first quarter until I knew enough about each to just roll with it and not want to flip back to remember who was who. It has that Maritime quirkiness, that way of doing things that is bent but makes for an amusing story. But mostly it's touching. The dysfunction that never mends itself but still manages to rise above. I'm so glad I have the two other books in the trilogy."}, {"userName": "Donovan Lessard", "userReviewDate": "Jul 16, 2014", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/23528438-donovan-lessard", "userReview": "This was my first DAR novel.

When I finally got around to the in the last year I was awed by the quality of the writing and not at all depressed by the stories. Richards invests the characters with dignity even when they are deeply flawed or endlessly frustrated by fate. Their stories make up a record of unnoticed lives, and offer hope even in failure or tragedy. Nights Below Station Street makes a great start.

Not an easy or comfortable read. It also doesn't have a plot, per se, but consists of a series of moments that highlight the characters as their move on through their lives. I liked it, and it won a GG award, but it wasn't always easy to read -- sometimes it devolved, for me, into a mere list of depressing incidents tumbling one over another.
