The novel is a passable crime thriller to read during the summer and for those that like their tales raw and pulpy. It should be pointed out the novel is graphic in both violence and sex. For this reader, the sex scenes did not add to the book and instead took away from the main theme. In them, there seemed to be a conflict in the writing style of the writer when the descriptive and chosen words of those scenes are compared to other parts of the novel. Still, it is an above average novel and for those that like this kind of novel, other books by the author will most likely be sought out."}, {"userName": "Yellagirlgc", "userReviewDate": "May 31, 2017", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/19324853-yellagirlgc", "userReview": "4.5 starsThanks to St Martin's press and NetGalley I was able to receive a copy of this book for review. Jaquavis Coleman has done it again. I loved this book. There were names from past reads that were easily recognized as well as new people I hope show up in future reads. Basil started out as a kid but was definitely a man by the end of the book. He started out picking up drugs for his addicted mother and ended up in a very different position. Being mentored by Kane Garrett changed his life.The anticipation of a Jaquavis Coleman and an Ashley Jaquavis book is always high. After reading this its even higher.

If you don't know that love is law and family is business, you will quickly find out! There are no kings in the streets, only placeholders and how long you are able to reign depends on how well you maneuver all the pieces in play. This read is intoxicating and thrilling.You will read to the end and definitely want more. There is a fix for every reader whether you are into drama, mystery, romance, erotica, and even self help. The Streets Have No King is wonderfully written because you clearly see what's happening, but never know what's coming.

Dark, gritty, and intense. The plot caught my attention instantly. Here, I met a main charcater who doesn't go back to his old lifestyle. I would have thought he would, but he didn't. At least, not right away. Then, he meets a young man who he sees something in and together they go to the main character's bad way of life. To them, it wasn't bad...until stakes were involved. Like the previous street king's daughter. Then, from there...things quickly escalated and heated. Danger, suspense, and intrigue has tied itself around me. Taking me hostage within the book. JaQuavis Coleman's writing has a way of planting me deep inside a different world. A world where there are no friends and only risks to take. A non ending game of life, death, and chances of the high life. But as with the real world criminal activity always had a way of pulling one down under...and destroying what was once good. Overall, I enjoyed exploring this urban street fiction. I would recommend this novel to adults only due to the high volume of drugs and violence. Interesting read...that contains real life scenarios. I got this copy from the publisher and this is my honest review."}, {"userName": "Denise Gilliam", "userReviewDate": "Apr 05, 2018", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/4715275-denise-gilliam", "userReview": "Omg this book was off the chain I don\u2019t know why it took me so long to read it. Baby this book was a definite page turner. I would never wired this book would play out like this. Let me just say this Basil was one young man who learned the game and used it to his average. His only problem was he fell for the wrong girl. Maybe different time different place things would have worked out between them. I loved how he got his sweet revenge at the end.

Blood paints the streets when she becomes a casualty of war, and treachery as well as deceit are everywhere. This is the true definition of \"Trust No Man!\"This, by far, is one of the best books I've read, not just in 2017; but by @realjaquavis in general. I highly recommend it, but suggest that you read catch up with the Cartel series before you do, because there will be a few \"special guests\" that make an appearance. I wish I could give this book more than \ud83d\udc8e\ud83d\udc8e\ud83d\udc8e\ud83d\udc8e\ud83d\udc8e,because it was just that good!

It started out telling you about a boy who just wanted to take care of the person whom he loved the most, his mother. He learned valuable life lessons along the way via Kane(The King of the Streets of Flint). He learns life is a game of checkers not chess so think long term. He learned that no matter how much your mind tells you that something is not a great idea your heart will always make the decision it wants. He learned that all loyalty is tested when your back is up against the wall. Brother will turn on brother. Friend on friend and father on son. It brings in just enough of the Cartel series to keep you in world of the Diamond Family. But even without all the life lessons this book is a great romance novel with an urban twist. You will be denying yourself a treat, a page turner and wonderful collection to the book shelf."}, {"userName": "Emquegee", "userReviewDate": "Aug 15, 2017", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/24139550-emquegee", "userReview": "Everything that glitters ain't gold.What I like most about JaQuavis' stand alone books is that they are a departure from the everyday dope boy tale. Troubled little black boy grows into a drug kingpin. His stand alone stories are different. They show the downside to the dope boy turned kingpin or almost kingpin lifestyle. More than anything \"The Streets Have No King\" to me was a cautionary tale. 1 of those everything that glitters ain't gold stories. I would recommend this book to anybody that is a fan of Mr. Coleman's work and just anybody that wants to read about all sides of the life. The streets truly have no king. It's just like gambling the house (streets) always wins. And the streets are as loyal as a hoe, they only love the money."}, {"userName": "Marisa Gonzalez", "userReviewDate": "Oct 07, 2017", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/5464567-marisa-gonzalez", "userReview": "Story of a high stakes drug dealer who returns to the streets after a seven year prison sentence and becomes a mentor to a young dealer. I found this book to be a bit far fetched. In real life a drug dealer who is that rich would not be flaunting it in front of everyone and attracting attention nor would a university hire one to teach a course. Though the story was silly at times I did find it entertaining and was considering giving it four stars.....that is until I read the surprise twist at the end when the relationships of the characters change. I was so disgusted I knocked the rating down to two stars.

Okay I wish there was more of a backstory through Basil's life like how did he get his name What turned his mom to drugs when she had her heart on being a lawyer & why didn't he just move out the hood instead of following into the game when he had just the right aura and brains to get out the sh*t . . . His mom was a cold piece of work but he still loved her they should've atleast put a chapter of her trying to fix her wrongs instead of just a limp smh some moms don't deserve children !!!.Imo he was a smart dummy smart with staying low-key but dumb when it came to sleeping with the connect's cousin come on we could (well atleast I could smell that set up a mile away).As for Kane I wish he had a diffrent name in the urban world the name Kane , King , or Jefe is used too much his name should've been Zeus , Pharoh , or Messiah I just think the name Kane should be retired for atleast 20 years. I liked him but he wasn't as powerful as what they made him he only saught after Basil because he was broke ... he was no different from Nephew he to used Basil  I just knew I wouldn't like Fat Rat just the nane alone let me know what's up with that n*gga if old friends did not mean soo much too Kane he should've killed Fat's along time ago why didn't he do it when he killed ol' boy in that vacant apartment . . . I liked Moriah (Mariah) I wished she had a better name too something like Keziah , Neima (Ny-ima) or Kamiyah I liked how she was portrayed a brown skinned sista with locs with need more of that instead of the big booty vixen types in urban book after urban book :) her backstory should've been explored more it made no sense how dumb she was too like girl you got everything but you want to be so hood hell nah if I was her I would've stayed far away from the fire & became a nurse so when my pops got out of jail he wouldn't need to train someone to reboot his drug empire ... But instead we could've lived comfortable on my means alone and good investments . . . . she was a wannabe hood princess in search of some good d*ck . . . . Lil Noah and Mecca kind of put me in the mind of Animal (from Kwan's books) . . . I do feel this book was rushed :/ and some parts left hanging the best part was the ending like damn it scared me from now on I won't ever turn my back !!!! I had a feeling I knew Frenchie's secret a long time ago smh so the whole relationship between Basil & Moriah should've never happend . . . instead of Kane making Basil into the top young bull of the streets he should've showed him a better way and kept him out the streets it's like egos got the best of these two :( . . . I wish so many characters weren't killed off because a part II would been good something titled the Best King The Streets Ever Known . . . Now if this book got turned into a movie I already know who should play who : Frechie:Angela Bassette Dog:Stevie JKeema:Ava DuVernayBasil : Michael B Jordan or Lance Gross Kane: Idris Elba or Michael Warren (both of them are fine vintage eye candy)Fat Rat:Cedric the Entertainer or Lavell Crawford Moriah:Kelela or Dewanda Wise (both pretty sistas !)Landon:Liam NeesonLJ:Chet Hanks Mecca: Jason Weaver (this would be a challenging role since he hasn't been in any gritty movies like that but I would love for him to pull this off)Lil Noah:Trevor Jackson (now that boy can act !!!) Vivian:Sharon Leal or Nia Long Boone:Darrin Henson"}, {"userName": "Wendy Jensen", "userReviewDate": "Aug 22, 2017", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/18235655-wendy-jensen", "userReview": "An excellent read that will keep you on the edge of your seat and not want to put it down.
