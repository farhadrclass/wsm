The next time someone asks me how they can pay me back...I will defintely tell them to pay it forward instead!2. Don't just SAY you are going to do something to help someone....stop talking about it and DO it. Life is short.I liked that it was a child who came up with the idea of \"paying it forward\" and that it was his answer to the question of how he could change the world.I also liked how the author focused on different people who were effected by The Movement, of Paying It ForwardThe last 30 pages or so were so sad. (that's where the tears come in)I wish it didnt end the way it did....so unfair."}, {"userName": "Rebecca McNutt", "userReviewDate": "Jan 07, 2015", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/36977686-rebecca-mcnutt", "userReview": "I saw the 2000 film adaptation of Pay It Forward in my health and human services class, so I figured I should read the book, and I can easily say that although the film was good, the book was better by far! The characters feel much more real and \"alive\" in the book, the descriptions of everything are well-detailed and incredibly vivid, and the book itself is both depressing and very hopeful. It's an excellent novel about selflessness, empathy and understanding, and about how we all have it in our own power to do the right thing and pay it forward."}, {"userName": "Luciano", "userReviewDate": "Nov 21, 2008", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/1715408-luciano", "userReview": "I was moved to read this book after hearing a couple of people at work raving about it.I love the premise of the author's idea and how she goes about developing it within the story line. It really is an excellent story. What makes this story so engrossing to read, is how the author piggy backs from one situation to another, eventually bringing it full circle. It's like watching a row of literary dominoes fall, one on top of another; with the fall of each subsequent domino influencing the trajectory of the next and all those behind it.The story also has very important and inspiring message, one that it gets across without banging the book over your head, and that is that indivudally we can facilitate change in society one person at a time. We can create hope and a sense of purpose if we are willing to challenge outselves to see people for their potential as good human beings, rather than just other people who happen to share our same geographic areas.I also enjoyed the characters in this story who are all so amazingly different, yet who all find within themselves the compassion to care that keeps the chain going.This is an excellent book. A book that inspires us to be more than what we typically manage to be."}, {"userName": "Kandice", "userReviewDate": "Oct 06, 2014", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/1396160-kandice", "userReview": "I remembered this movie from the 90s and had a sappy feeling when I thought of it, but still dove right in because usually if you enjoy a movie the book is infinitely better. I found that to be the case here.The entire premise of the book is a Social Studies extra credit assignment to think of a way to better the world. Trevor MicKinney takes the assignment to heart. Trevor is the only child of a hard working, tender-hearted (kind of) down on her luck single mother. He is wise beyond his years and his maturity matches his wisdom. Trevor\u2019s big idea is simple. Do something for three people. Something big. It doesn't need to involve money, but must be important to the person you are doing it for. That person will then \u201cPay it forward\u201d to three others. Seriously, stop reading and do a tiny bit of the math. 1 X 3 X 9 X 27 X 81 X 243... it could touch the entire country in a year. In the novel, it does.One of the people Trevor helps is a homeless man who ends up going to jail. He then \u201cPays it forward\u201d in such a way that it works it way to New York gangs and catches on like gangbusters. Gang violence is down 80% and the police don\u2019t know why. Who would ever think a little boy began this whole movement. The Movement, by the way, is what the gangs have taken to calling it.I hate reviews that spoil the plot so I won\u2019t spell it all out, but it takes a while for Trevor to be recognized and when he is the reward is unjust. Was it sappy? A bit, and I admit I shed a tear or two, but it was a lovely tale and I was happy to see how those around Trevor benefited."}, {"userName": "Skip", "userReviewDate": "Jan 27, 2016", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/1389748-skip", "userReview": "A disfigured lonely war veteran, Social Studies teacher Reuben St. Clair, assigns an extra credit project to his class to change the world.

Meanwhile, Trevor lives with his mother, Arlene, who has been abandoned by Trevor's father and is also lonely. Trevor thinks his project is a failure when one of his beneficiaries goes to jail and another dies.

Even so, I pushed some things off and shuffled the schedule around in order to make time for reading.I had seen the movie a few years ago, but hadn\u2019t been aware until recently that it had been based on a book. Usually the books are better and more satisfying than the movies that are based on them, so I was happy to find a copy of \u201cPay It Forward\u201d in my local library. After reading it, in the space of about twenty-four hours, I am giving each family member a copy.It\u2019s true I\u2019m an avid reader and take great pleasure getting lost in a good story, but I don\u2019t usually become quite so emotionally involved in a book that I burst into tears in just the first few pages. This is what happened with Hyde\u2019s novel, and it set the tone for the rest of the story. The writer\u2019s honest and compassionate style of writing is deceptively simple. Her characters are far from extraordinary and can be downright maddening in their very human foibles, but this is precisely what makes them so accessible. For the most part, these are not enviable, heroic people, and they often reflect back to us the worst and most frustrating aspects of ourselves.Arlene revealed to me what could have become of my own life, at least in one particular aspect: she is an alcoholic, struggling with getting sober. She\u2019ll get a few days or even a few months in, and then it\u2019s all over in one night when life simply gets too tough. And even when she does manage to leave the alcohol behind, she is forced to look herself right in the face, warts and all, whether she wants to or not. What I do remember of the first few years of sobriety was a similarly shaky emotional rollercoaster, accompanied by brutal reality that was often way too real.And so I was ripped raw by a simple entry from her son\u2019s diary, before Arlene\u2019s story began to unfold. Trevor, who invents the idea of \u201cpaying it forward,\u201d compares his mother to a child with a medical condition that leaves him without the ability to feel pain, only Trevor sees that Arlene is like that on the inside. He writes that she knows not to \u201ckeep putting her hand on the hot stove,\u201d and yet she keeps doing it anyway \u2014 knowing that she is hurting herself, but unable to stop, and unable to really feel the pain.The title, of course, is taken from a school project that Trevor turns in for his social studies class. Accepting an assignment to come up with an idea that can change the world, Trevor maps out a plan to help three people \u2014 really help them, to have a positive, life-altering impact \u2014 and then instead of asking those people to pay him back, require instead that they \u201cpay it forward\u201d to another three people, who then each will pay it forward to another three, and so on. The idea is brilliant in its simplicity, and incredibly powerful in action. Assuming that everyone follows through. Trusting another human being with so large a task, especially in today\u2019s cynical, closed-off society, is not small feat in itself, regardless of the results.Hyde masterfully tracks the starts and stops in the lives of her characters as they reach for, then reject, then reach for again the growth, the happiness, and the real living that are rightfully theirs.Ultimately, I found this story to be about compassion, about putting aside your ego for one moment, for one beautiful opportunity to be truly present for another human being in need, with absolutely no thought of what you\u2019re going to get in return. Because the whole point is to keep that \u201ccompassion in action\u201d moving ever forward, spreading vigilantly across the globe. The miraculous side benefit to these acts of altruism is proving to yourself that regardless of how low and useless you think you might be, you can and do have power to impact the world around you \u2014 and that kind of honest self-realization changes you. Your priorities change, your principles shift, and you find that you are not at all the person you once thought you were. You are plugged into something larger than yourself; you belong; you are an active co-creator in the world at large.Sure, I knew where the book was headed, because even with all of the differences between the text and the screen, I\u2019d seen the movie, and the story is largely the same. Even so, I was astonished to find myself in need of a fresh kleenex every couple of pages as the book drew to a close. The incredible potential for the planet that this book describes has simply rattled me to my core. It\u2019s so simple, really. How easy it would be, through intentional, deliberate action, to change another person\u2019s life for the better. To help someone who is down on his luck to get back on his feet again. To help an at-risk teenager afford an education. To help a struggling family set up a home of their own. To help a single mother find a decent job. To be the gift of friendship in the life of a lonely neighbor. To help an adult learn how to read. To simply show up for someone, especially a complete stranger, and ask, \u201cHow can I help?\u201dWe each have that power in our hands, at this very moment. How many such moments have we let slip by, unrealized?"}, {"userName": "Hailey Leister", "userReviewDate": "May 01, 2013", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/6561788-hailey-leister", "userReview": "In this exciting book a boy named Trevor gets a project from his Social Studies teacher to somehow change the world.

At a few pages in I was tempted to just flick it as a twee concept.....and suddenly found myself hooked in by the characterisation.

His concept of \u201cPaying it Forward,\u201d carrying out a good turn, something big, for someone who cannot do it for him or herself, is a worthy one. Unfortunately, the story was bogged down by an on-again, off-again romance between his mother and teacher that became extremely repetitive and took focus away from the central idea of the book. I wish it had focused more on the boy\u2019s idea and the creative ways people could perform good acts, but it seemed to focus mostly on \u201crescuing\u201d people, either physically or financially. The writing was rudimentary, and the ending negated the purpose behind the concept.

I've seen the film years ago but don't remember feeling anywhere near as moved as I was in reading the novel. I finished having to wipe tears away so I could read the final pages.A 12 year old boy, on being asked to come up with an idea to change the world in his Social Science class, creates the idea of 'Pay it Forward', doing good deeds for others and then rather than paying back the person who did one for you, helping someone else. Initially feeling his attempts aren't going well, the reader is treated to narrations by those he meets and just how they react to Trevor's good deeds and what then happens to them.The story mostly stays with Trevor, his two-job-holding mum Arlene, and his Vietnam-vet teacher Reuben St Clair, and their changing relationships. Journalist Chris brings the story together with his investigations and articles.To describe in any more detail is not necessary. If you're not sold on this book already, then there's little more I could say. It's an idea that by rights every human being should try to aim for - helping other people even when there's nothing in it for you. Trevor is adorable. I just wanted to hug, protect and nurture him. Arlene and Reuben are a wonderful pair to watch pacing around each other, each damaged, each lonely, both awkward.This won't take you long to read. It's inspiring, saddening and emotional, and I expect will stay with me for quite a while. Hope you can make time for it too."}, {"userName": "sue", "userReviewDate": "Sep 27, 2013", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/7377874-sue", "userReview": "I am so happy to be a part of Catherine Ryan Hyde's read and review team in the UK. I love her books and look forward to each one as she releases them.This story was different to some of the books she has written about as in style of writing. I found it fascinating to read it from all angles, and from Trevor's point of view as a child. I think most reviews have expressed what the book is about, and the extra challenge that was weaved in, Trevor taking this seriously did a superb job to change the world. I kept thinking \"out of the mouths of babes\" another cliche was \" from small acorns big trees grow\".Its not often a book leaves me in tears. The last 30-40 pages just made me cave in. I was so reading between the tears in my eyes.Catherine Ryan Hyde has such a unique style about her, there are a few authors that can do this. They move you to tears, passion, hate, fear, emotions that you have they can bring out in you. If an author can do this, they are doing their work properly, as life evokes emotions. So should books. I felt quite enpowered after I read this, quite sad too. I knew why it had to end this way, there was no other way to do it.Thank you Catherine for another amazing read."}, {"userName": "Leila", "userReviewDate": "Nov 13, 2017", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/15194189-leila", "userReview": "I saw the film of this book A long time ago but can't remember it in detail only that the theme of course was the same. The book is much fuller and for me has a slow start so that I wasn't sure I was going to engage with it for awhile. I was taken aback to discover the book is stated to be suitable for the age range if 8 to 12 years. Whoever decided that I wonder? Both the sexual content and the style of the writing makes it more appropriate for older children I would think. The concept of paying it forward' is of course a wonderful idea and I only wish it was really true. The world could certainly do with it. It is written in an unusual style in that the characters appear to be writing a diary in a way by entering their thoughts and experiences. The young boy clearly is doing this, but other parts seem to have a narrator also. This does mean that the novel jumps about backwards and forwards from character to character which I found confusing and a tad frustrating throughout the book. The ending has a definite twist which in a way felt almost contrived but not to most reviewers. This is just my personal opinion and most reviewers have given the book five stars. I wouldn't read it again."}, {"userName": "\u00a7\u266b\u266a\u2665Delaney\u2665\u266a\u266b\u00a7 Wants To Help K", "userReviewDate": "May 02, 2013", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/6708663-delaney-wants-to-help-k", "userReview": "Pay it Forward by Catherine Ryan Hyde is about a 12 year old boy named Trevor who is in 7th grade.

Books such as this one tend to make me doubt my ability to digest and appreciate what so many other readers seem to be able to do. I ask myself, did this book actually achieve it's popularity because it became a well known movie? I have found a couple other books written by Hyde to be stunning; profound; worth a second read but this novel leaves me going \"huh?\". First of all, I had to flip back and forth and back and forth during the first few \"chapters\" (if you can call them that) to figure out who the writer was talking about and then to whom the character was referring and then the time frame and the place. After a half dozen flips back and forth I had to get up and retrieve another cup of coffee and stand in the kitchen and ask myself yet again, what the hell is wrong with me that I don't like this book?

A young boy Trevor is set an assignment at school to do something that will change the world. Trevor comes up with an idea of doing a good deed for 3 people and those people will pay it forward and help others. Trevor is a lovely boy, living with his mother and his father has disappeared. He likes his teacher Reuben and they form a lovely relationship. It was nice to read about how Trevor decided who needed help and the impact of his little idea. Now to put that forward in the real world!"}], "description": "The story of how a boy who believed in the goodness of human nature set out to change the world.Pay It Forward is a wondrous and moving novel about Trevor McKinney, a twelve-year-old boy in a small California town who accepts the challenge that his teacher gives his class, a chance to earn extra credit by coming up with a plan to change the world for the better -- and to put that plan into action.The idea that Trevor comes up with is so simple and so na\u00efve that when others learn of it they are dismissive. Even Trevor himself begins to doubt when his \"pay it forward\" plan seems to founder on a combination of bad luck and the worst of human nature.In the end, Pay It Forward is the story of seemingly ordinary people made extraordinary by the simple faith of a child. In the tradition of the successful and inspirational television show Touched by an Angel, and the phenomenally successful novel and film Forrest Gump, Pay It Forward is a work of charm, wit, and remarkable inspiration, a story of hope for today and for many tomorrows to come.", "title": "Pay It Forward", "url": "http://www.goodreads.com/book/show/215631.Pay_It_Forward", "average": 4.16, "cover": "https://images.gr-assets.com/books/1388936719l/215631.jpg", "reviews": 813, "authors": [{"url": "https://www.goodreads.com/author/show/126447.Catherine_Ryan_Hyde", "name": "Catherine Ryan Hyde"}], "type": [], "outlinks": ["http://www.goodreads.com/book/show/13072303-la-formula-del-cuore", "http://www.goodreads.com/book/show/6780660-when-i-found-you", "http://www.goodreads.com/book/show/19355355-take-me-with-you", "http://www.goodreads.com/book/show/30184217-say-goodbye-for-now", "http://www.goodreads.com/book/show/33389838-allie-and-bea", "http://www.goodreads.com/book/show/25526969-ask-him-why", "http://www.goodreads.com/book/show/39928984-mercy-among-the-children", "http://www.goodreads.com/book/show/20620995-take-me-with-you", "http://www.goodreads.com/book/show/6565401-five-quarters-of-the-orange", "http://www.goodreads.com/book/show/25600623-the-diver-s-clothes-lie-empty", "http://www.goodreads.com/book/show/18867378-the-traveler-s-gift", "http://www.goodreads.com/book/show/40198373-big-stone-gap", "http://www.goodreads.com/book/show/40198387-friendship-bread", "http://www.goodreads.com/book/show/40193401-the-little-giant-of-aberdeen-county", "http://www.goodreads.com/book/show/31160055-the-last-cherry-blossom", "http://www.goodreads.com/book/show/35963775-her-sister-s-shoes", "http://www.goodreads.com/book/show/22617980-the-rock-harbor-collection", "http://www.goodreads.com/book/show/35269080-a-thousand-tomorrows", "http://www.goodreads.com/book/show/40204902-caravans", "http://www.goodreads.com/book/show/31192689-shoeless-joe", "http://www.goodreads.com/book/show/40204877-a-hero-of-france", "http://www.goodreads.com/book/show/6473113-death-in-venice", "http://www.goodreads.com/book/show/40266651-the-tilted-world", "http://www.goodreads.com/book/show/33117501-blonde", "http://www.goodreads.com/book/show/36546758-ever-after", "http://www.goodreads.com/book/show/40193580-rescue", "http://www.goodreads.com/book/show/36589911-the-lords-of-discipline", "http://www.goodreads.com/book/show/11963271-the-sheltering-sky", "http://www.goodreads.com/book/show/25596951-the-dressmaker-s-war", "http://www.goodreads.com/book/show/35120598-gena-finn", "http://www.goodreads.com/book/show/29550710-a-charles-martin-collection", "http://www.goodreads.com/book/show/19977229-remember-tuesday-morning", "http://www.goodreads.com/book/show/28353727-in-twenty-years", "http://www.goodreads.com/book/show/8530701-a-town-like-alice", "http://www.goodreads.com/book/show/35414455-the-other-alcott", "http://www.goodreads.com/book/show/18800554-the-scavenger-s-daughters", "http://www.goodreads.com/book/show/40205036-under-the-udala-trees", "http://www.goodreads.com/book/show/32861105-the-streets-have-no-king", "http://www.goodreads.com/book/show/20552595-how-i-became-a-famous-novelist", "http://www.goodreads.com/book/show/39929534-the-passion", "http://www.goodreads.com/book/show/35654710-this-dark-road-to-mercy", "http://www.goodreads.com/book/show/21942189-the-language-of-hoofbeats"]}
