Would you not at least reworked the dialogue???"}], "description": "Meet Pele, Hawaiian goddess of the volcanoes. Meet Katherine O'Dell, recently and reluctantly divorced, stranded on the island of Hawai\u2018i after her husband has left her. A trained therapist, Katherine has no choice but to hang her shingle in the hopes of making ends meet. What follows is an unlikely encounter, one that can transform Katherine for life or threaten to consume what little she has left. Pele in Therapy is an original short story that carries on Hawai\u2018i's long tradition of storytelling and myth making. Written with both humor and an eye for detail, best-selling author Darien Gee has created a modern view of the goddess and her impact on those lucky enough to call Hawai\u2018i home. Includes a conversation with the author, discussion questions, and a special excerpt from the novel Sweet Life, written by Mia King.", "title": "Pele in Therapy: A Short Story", "url": "http://www.goodreads.com/book/show/22096320-pele-in-therapy", "average": 3.14, "cover": "https://images.gr-assets.com/books/1400195289l/22096320.jpg", "reviews": 1, "authors": [{"url": "https://www.goodreads.com/author/show/4472748.Darien_Gee", "name": "Darien Gee"}], "type": [], "outlinks": ["http://www.goodreads.com/book/show/9744817-friendship-bread", "http://www.goodreads.com/book/show/13642949-the-avalon-ladies-scrapbooking-society", "http://www.goodreads.com/book/show/18868730-an-avalon-christmas", "http://www.goodreads.com/book/show/33148584-an-avalon-valentine", "http://www.goodreads.com/book/show/22440903-writing-the-hawaii-memoir"]}
