I don't know) of Avalon. Author Darien Gee has returned to this location and characters in subsequent books: \"The Avalon Ladies Scrapbooking Society\", \"An Avalon Christmas\" and now in \"An Avalon Valentine.\" It is nice to revisit some of these characters we have come to known. But due to the length of this book (176 electronic pages) Gee doesn't have a lot to work with regards to the four main story-lines she decides to follow. Story-line 1 follows long time character Hannah Wang. She is happy in her relationship with her boyfriend Jamie Linde, but now her ex-husband is back trying to rekindle their former relationship. Story-line 2 follows another long time character, Connie Colls who is getting a bit bored with her samey relationship with vet Eli. That is until a new vet comes along who has Eli changing his ways.Story-line 3 and 4 follow two characters that are new, Lucia Blake and Goldie Love (yeah that last name...sigh). Lucia is dealing with having a crush on her mail carrier and Goldie is a retired romance writer who is resistant to celebrating her 50th wedding anniversary. There's a little hidden story-line in this one too, Julia Evarts daughter from the first book, Gracie, gets a little part of the Valentine's Day theme, I honestly wish that it had been cut since it just didn't work well with the other 4 story-lines. I have to say for me this whole book was a wash. The POV jumped around a lot and we don't get to spend much time with any of these characters. I thought that Hannah's story-line had the most potential and could have been it's own stand alone book taking place in Avalon, but shoehorning in Connie, Lucia, and Goldie's stories just made the whole book feel cluttered. Maybe if Gee had decided to make this into a full length novel so some of these stories could have breathed it would have worked better. The writing was okay, but I was missing the magical sense of this town that I have read about for a few years now. I just thought that the background of Valentine's Day would make it more interesting, but I was honestly bored. Maybe if Gee had shaken things up a bit with regards to some of the longer term romances in this book that would have made for a more compelling read? It just seemed most of the issues were once again adults not talking to each other and everyone just ignoring having a conversation that ended up fixing all in like ten minutes. The ending fell a little flat. I am happy to get some new Amish friendship bread recipes though."}, {"userName": "Lauren", "userReviewDate": "Feb 06, 2017", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/32596820-lauren", "userReview": "I absolutely love Darien Gee's sweet series in Avalon.

She finally sent me a copy through Amazon so I could read it through the Kindle app. THANK YOU!!! An Avalon Valentine was well worth it!I usually read a lot of Christian fiction, so I wasn't sure what to expect when I first start An Avalon Valentine as it was touted as a women's fictional romance. There was no need to worry as there was no sex scenes and everything was light-hearted and heart-warming.The town of Avalon seems like any other basic small-town in America. Everyone knows one-another and is always looking out for each other. At first the book was a little hard to follow because there were four different storylines going at once and I couldn't keep them straight. However, after reading further they all started to make sense and I was drawn into the characters and their lives--or should I say love stories since Valentine's Day is all the rage in the town of Avalon?I loved how the characters' stories were interwoven and that at the end of the day, true love and friendship always wins! (Of course, chocolate treats and different varieties of friendship bread didn't hurt either.)If you're looking for a great read that values friendship and romance, this is the book for you. I can't wait to read the rest of the books in the Avalon series!I did receive this book for free from the author in exchange for a review and my honest opinion."}, {"userName": "Maria", "userReviewDate": "Nov 09, 2017", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/5944941-maria", "userReview": "If you want to read a book about love in a small-town, this is it! I love Darien Gee's stories about adventures in Avalon; all of them are heartfelt and touching, the best series about small-town life that I've ever read! This book told the story of five couples; Hannah and Jamie (as well as Phillipe's unwanted attention), Gracie and Finn, Connie and Eli, Lucia and Paul, and Goldie and Edwards (along with their daughter, Celia). I really enjoyed reading about the adventures that each of these couples got into, with Finn proclaiming his love to Gracie by asking to be her valentine, to Connie decorating Eli's office for Valentine's Day, then running into the police. Each moment of the stories depicted in this book kept me on my toes, and made me wish for more! I was happy to read that all of the couples mentioned ended up finding what they were looking for, which made for a wonderful ending. Overall, a beautifully-written compilation of stories that kept me on my toes!"}, {"userName": "Sheilla Thomas", "userReviewDate": "Feb 07, 2018", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/42141288-sheilla-thomas", "userReview": "The Story ContinuesI love visiting Avalon and how everyone is so integrated in one way or another!

Jilted at the altar, Lucia Blake now spends her days making chocolate in an effort to keep some sweetness in her life while hoping for her own happily ever after. Former professional cellist Hannah Wang is uncertain about her future with boyfriend Jamie Linde when her ex-husband re-appears in her life, intent on winning her back. Tea salon manager Connie Colls is planning a Valentine\u2019s Day surprise for Eli, her busy veterinarian boyfriend, in the hopes of spicing things up, but she\u2019s unprepared for who shows up. For young Gracie Evarts, first love comes in the form of know-it-all Finn O\u2019Neill, whose big idea for a kissing booth might succeed, but only with Gracie\u2019s help. Goldie and Edward Love have agreed to a 50th anniversary celebration, but when their daughter uses one of Goldie\u2019s old journals as inspiration for the party, Goldie knows it\u2019s time to confess a long-held secret. An Avalon Valentine is funny and full of heart, shedding light on what it means to love and to be loved. \u201cSweet, funny and delicious, An Avalon Valentine is a charming tale of first love, friendship, and second chances. A joy to read at any time of the year.\u201d Jessica Barksdale Inclan, author of How to Bake a Man and One Small Thing \"Darien Gee has a writer\u2019s heart.\u201d Nancy Pickard, New York Times bestselling author of The Scent of Rain and Lightning", "title": "An Avalon Valentine", "url": "http://www.goodreads.com/book/show/33148584-an-avalon-valentine", "average": 4.06, "cover": "https://images.gr-assets.com/books/1480435099l/33148584.jpg", "reviews": 12, "authors": [{"url": "https://www.goodreads.com/author/show/4472748.Darien_Gee", "name": "Darien Gee"}], "type": [], "outlinks": ["http://www.goodreads.com/book/show/9744817-friendship-bread", "http://www.goodreads.com/book/show/13642949-the-avalon-ladies-scrapbooking-society", "http://www.goodreads.com/book/show/18868730-an-avalon-christmas", "http://www.goodreads.com/book/show/22440903-writing-the-hawaii-memoir", "http://www.goodreads.com/book/show/22096320-pele-in-therapy"]}
