The Breaks of The Game, the book that resulted, remains one of the best sports books I have ever read and a work that has easily stood the test of time.The author of more than 20 books on topics as diverse as the Vietnam War, the modern civil rights struggle, the decline of the American auto industry, and the history of American media , Halberstam returned again and again to sports as a topic.Although readers of The Teammates and The Summer of '49 could tell that baseball during those years had a particularly firm grip on Halberstam's heart, The Breaks of the Game remains a special work, even among the 10 of his books that I have read.To begin, unlike many sports narratives, the story follows the Portland franchise after its memorable ascent and during what ultimately became a lengthy decline. As a result, the triumphant moment, while still present in the book, is a reminder of past and rapidly receding glory, rather than the culmination that precedes the tidy wrap up and update in the Epilogue. In additon to the narrative arc, The Breaks of the Game is replete with vivid and memorable characters, from coach Jack Ramsay, whose inability to accept losses affect his mental health and relationships with his friends, to power forward Maurice Lucas, whose physical style of play is vital to the Blazers' success yet who, like an earlier Shawn Marionon the Mike Dantoni-era Phoenix Suns, feels unappreciated, to Billy Ray Bates, the cocky, late- season addition to the squad who helps fuel the Blazers' late-season playoff run.The characters do not just exist on the court. Rather, Halberstam employed his relentless reporting drive with his direct knowledge of American history-he covered nearly every major story from 1955 to his untimely death in 2007-to create textured portrayals that teach the reader about the players' background and even more about their place in American society. Bates, for example, grew up in the cotton fields of Mississippi; Halberstam ends the book with tales of his playing reverberating in that community. He also writes extensively about Kermit Washington, the enormously shy power forward from Washington, DC, whose life became inextricably linked with Houston Rockets star Rudy Tomjanovich when he punched the oncoming Tomjanovich in the face during an on court fight between teammates.And, of course, there is Walton, the supremely talented, sharp-passing, politically active, red headed center who had one of the greatest careers in NCAA history, yet who never quite delivered on his enormous promise in the NBA because of his recurring injuries.These portraits add tremendous richness to the book because they provide far deeper context than one usually sees in accounts of sporting games-I'm about halfway through Dan Rooney's My 75 Years with the Pittsburgh Steelers and the NFL and don't know if I'm going to be able to make it for that reason.The Breaks of the Games also has many memorable moments. Some are of unintentional cruelty. Halberstam describes how a surgeon tells Geoff Petrie, a former Rookie of the Year and an early Blazers star, that he will never play basketball again, and then a second later exults at getting to meet New York Jets quarterback Joe Namath.Others are humorous. Halberstam's description of how glowering power forward Lloyd Neal, leapt up from the bench after Lucas blocked a Kareem Abdul-Jabbar sky hook ,and yelled, \"Take that, motherfucking cuckoo!\" to a startled and uncharacteristically silent Jack Nicholson, remains one of my favorite of all time. The exploits of the outrageous Marvin Barnes, who showed up just before game time in a mink coat with his uniform underneath are similarly entertaining. In short, the book is an utter treasure, and not just for sports fans (although hoops fans who have not yet read The Breaks of the Game are in for a real treat.). So, while checking out the latest exploits of Roy, Aldridge, Oden, Outlaw and Co., or for those who are simply looking for a greater, check out The Breaks of the Game. You will not be disappointed."}, {"userName": "Kyle", "userReviewDate": "Mar 01, 2011", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/4674578-kyle", "userReview": "\"The Cuckoo Man was Jack Nicholson, the movie star, a devoted follower of Laker basketball who had a seat right next to the Laker bench. In the championship season, when Portland had played Los Angeles, Nicholas had thus sat only about three feet away from the last man on the Portland bench who, in this case, happened to be Lloyd Neal, and everything that Nicholson said, every cry praising Kareem or belittling Walton, thundered in the ears of the Portland players. It was as if he had been chosen by the gods to bedevil them. At the halftime the Portland players had filed into the dressing room and one of the other players, impressed that so famous and yet now so manic a presence was seated so close to them, asked Ice if he knew who his neighbor was. No, he said, who? \"Jack Nicholson, Ice,\" someone had answered. \"You mean the little fellow, not much hair?\" Neal asked. \"Yes.\" \"Who's he?\" \"A movie star. Did a picture One Flew Over the Cuckoo's Nest.\" \"Oh yeah,\" said Ice, \"I know who he is, that guy.\" The others were not so sure whether Neal had seen the movie or not, they could never tell about Ice, whether he was smarter than they thought but playing dumb, or dumber than they thought but playing smart. In the second half Nicholson had kept up his cheering, loud, partisan, a noise which fell relentlessly upon the Portland bench. Then, late in the game, at a crucial moment, the game hanging in the balance, the Lakers had made a run and Kareem had gone out for a shot and as he did, Walton had gone up too and he had blocked it, and even as Walton reached the apex of his jump, his hand outstretched, the entire Portland bench had been aware of an even more dramatic moment: Lloyd Neal rising up out of his seat, huge now, intimidating, a great dark-visaged figure pointing a massive and threatening finger in a massive threatening hand at the suddenly tiny Nicholson. The others had watch this tableau, it seemed frozen in time for them, as if to symbolize the team's new invincibility, that they would not be beaten, not by Kareem, not by Los Angeles, not even by rich and celebrated actors, for there was Ice screaming at Nicholson, \"Take that, mother-fucking cuckoo!\" The moment had become part of the unofficial team history, a symbol of its triumph, and Nicholson, star of Chinatown, Five Easy Pieces and other great American films, had become simply The Cuckoo Man."}, {"userName": "Christopher Mezzetta", "userReviewDate": "Oct 03, 2009", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/959961-christopher-mezzetta", "userReview": "This book is a masterpiece. It's the best sports lit/sports history book I've ever read. So much was changing in the NBA in 1979; it was the birth of the modern league. Young David Stern. Magic and Bird were rookies. Incorporation of the four ABA teams and its players. Transition to a more \"black\" sport, or at least a less white sport. Crazy salaries for the younger players, while older players and coaches miss out on the money. Television contracts. Expansion teams. Everything was changing and it was a time of rich cultural fermentation in the sport.Also, being a relatively new Oregonian, this book follows the \"local\" sports team here in Oregon, and currently the only pro hoops team in the Northwest. In my Oregon indoctrination this book follows the Bill Bauerman book and precedes Kesey's \"Sometimes a Great Notion\"."}, {"userName": "Bill", "userReviewDate": "Dec 12, 2011", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/5784721-bill", "userReview": "Fascinating book! It's a conversational history of the NBA until 1981, told through the lense of the 1979-80 season of the Portland Trailblazers. As the team's season touches on various characters and issues, Halberstam pauses to explore them. Great character sketches/bios of most of the great players up until that point, the most interesting discussions I've read of the defining issues of the NBAs early years (race, TV rights, team ownership etc), as well as plenty of basketball content -- team play vs one on one, coaching styles, some great comments into the nature of the game itself, some selective play by play at key moments. The 1979-80 Blazers are an intriguing subject for the book -- an underachieving disfunctional team of resentful stars (Maurice Lucas, Lionel Hollins), players looking for redemption (Kermit Washington), aging veterans and hopeful rookies (Billy Ray Bates, Jim Paxson). Bill Walton had left the team the previous year, but together with Coach Jack Ramsey he is the central character in the book. At the close of the book (1981), the overall outlook for the NBA is very grim -- a mostly forgotten context for the rejuvenation which came with the Larry-Magic rivalry, Michael Jordan and (for Portland) Clyde Drexler (neither Jordan nor Drexler is mentioned in the book)."}, {"userName": "Christian Holub", "userReviewDate": "Jul 05, 2011", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/2103348-christian-holub", "userReview": "I told my dad I was reading this book because its reputation precedes it as one of the best sports books ever written. His matter-of-fact answer: \"well, that's because Halberstam is one of the best writers ever.\" 362 pages later, I can't help but agree. He may not be a hoity-toity modernist prose stylist like those names more often thrown around as candidates for that prestigious title, but he does possess a unique gift to seamlessly interweave logistics and information (about everything conceivable, such as the delicate structure of Bill Walton's foot) with emotional human stories (such as how a uniquely damage-prone foot affects the day-to-day life of a restless, athletic soul like Bill Waltoin). After I finished it, I gave this book to my dad to read, and soon enough found myself reading over his shoulder on an airplane. It sucks you in and doesn't let go. And to think that Halberstam's sportswriting was his hobby, done for fun years after he had already won his Pulitzer? That's like Dr. J winning an NBA championship as part of a high-flying Philly team in 1983, long after his legendary years on the Nets were a distant memory.

As a life-long Blazer fan, I started the book with the hopes of understanding the roots of my hometown team. What I found was an in-depth examination of the NBA in a period of evolution and stunted growth, with the '79-'80 Blazers as a vehicle to move the narrative forward. Halberstam's coverage of racial, social, and economic actions and consequences is direct and objective and provides far more of a historical read than I had expected. As it relates to my beloved team, Halberstam balances a presentation of facts from each player and the organization at large with his own commentary and observations that only a non-Portlander could provide objectively. Given the media climate surrounding the league and the players today, it's unlikely we'll see so talented an author with such unprecedented access to a team again. Basketball and Blazers fans alike will find this well-worth their time. Highly recommended!"}, {"userName": "Chris", "userReviewDate": "Aug 12, 2009", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/2620059-chris", "userReview": "I bought this book because I read somewhere that it was one of the greatest sports books ever written. Halberstam is a good writer and a master of the vignette. He does a great job of giving a sense of his subjects in just a few pages. Still, I'm not that interested in Bill Walton, who figures large, and I wasn't familiar with a number of the players. I did, however, become a fan of Kermit Washington's career. I was surprised how dated the book seemed; the NBA of the late 70s was all black/white, and Halberstam is constantly reviewing the racial dynamics involved in the league and among the Blazers. The desires for an earlier time in pro-sports when fans were unaware of the role of agents, contracts, and players unions seemed quaint. Maybe I'm not a big enough fan to have loved this book. I had trouble getting through the first 100 pages, but enjoyed the rest."}, {"userName": "Sebastien", "userReviewDate": "Dec 15, 2015", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/259402-sebastien", "userReview": "Wow. This is a phenomenal book. Halberstam gets into the nuts and bolts of not just basketball, but people, society, economics, and capitalism. Halberstam is A) a flat out great writer B) a compassionate progressive soul C) smart as heck D) an amazingly astute observer of life and people.Writing about the Portland Trailblazers circa 1980, he delves into the Blazers' players, management, and ownership. Often times he uses these great long story arcs and background expositions that helps bring life and color to all the protagonists. You get a true feel where people are from, their mentalities and why they are doing what they are doing, the inner politics of the league, the grinding crushing nature of the season, and also a hard look at how unrelentingly cold and brutal the NBA is as a business. What's amazing is that you don't feel Halberstam is kowtowing to anybody, he isn't writing nice things so he can keep and maintain access to stars and NBA insiders. No, you really feel he writes what he sees and what he thinks without reserve. Great book.

He follows the Portland Trailblazers through the 79-80 season, talking extensively with coaches, players, etc. Tells a pretty compelling story. Remember that this is when Magic and Bird are just coming into the league, and noone was sure whether/how long the NBA would survive. Long, interesting story of the history of the TV contract. (Started with ABC/Arledge. He feels screwed when he feels the league unfairly moves to CBS. Invents Superstars to dig into their ratings.) Lots about Walton, his feet, how they won when they won, how he left, etc. The only thing that prevents it from being really great is that I'm not quite familiar enough with all the characters (and there's really dozens) because I wasn't following the league that much then. OTOH, such a book could probably not be written now because access to players, etc, would be much more curtailed.Really 4.5"}, {"userName": "Matthew", "userReviewDate": "Jul 31, 2012", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/10243859-matthew", "userReview": "Halberstam's The Breaks of the Game chronicles the turbulent season of the Portland Trailblazers two years removed from their Championship season.The book doesn't tell the story of the cohesive team as much as the individual stories that make for a tediously long NBA season.Incredible insight into the responsibility these grown men feel being paid a princely sum to play a child's game.

One of, if not the best, sports books - no, books I\u2019ve read.

It\u2019s so much more. The 79-80 Blazers are merely the lens through which Halberstam examines a league in transition, the sociology of basketball, the relationship between sports and media, and so much more.

The reader is treated to an in-depth look at complex operations, those of the NBA and professional basketball teams, along with personalities, the rise and fall of talent, ego, mind set, strategy of building winners, and the fragility of teamwork. He discusses individual players and their triumph and struggles, millionaire owners and their strengths and frailties, and the constant search for perfection that is never fully discovered. As a lifelong basketball fan I was delighted to get the inside scoop on the game of hoops. Coaches and players that I\u2019ve followed for years are seen in a new light. Halberstam pulls no punches in his coverage, detailing the development of the remarkable skills necessary to make it in professional basketball, the subsequent fall when talent declines, the wedges driven between players, their coaches, agents and fans with salaries and playing time as the hammers. Halberstam\u2019s writing skills, analytical prowess, and deep knowledge of the underlying psychological and physical makeup of all the participants are carefully and impartially presented in skillful specifics.David Halberstam was killed on April 23, 2007 in a traffic accident in Northern California. He had just turned 73. The world was deprived of a great and versatile talent. There should be no doubt in any reader\u2019s mind about David Halberstam being the most talented and versatile writer ever. The journalistic approach to his many works, the combination of enormous research, impeccable writing style, and innate intelligence, produced countless best sellers and award winners on a variety of subjects. In his career he covered the Vietnam conflict for \u201cThe New York Times,\u201d for which he won the 1964 Pulitzer Prize, reported extensively on the Civil Rights movement, lived in Poland until he was expelled for being subversive, wrote on JFK\u2019s Vietnam War foreign policy decisions, did profiles on American media giants, wrote about Michael Jordan, about the baseball pennant race between the New York Yankees and the Boston Red Sox, about football coach Bill Belichick, about Engine 40, Ladder 35 of the New York City Fire Department in the aftermath of 9/11, and on and on. Believe it or not I\u2019ve read most of his work. He is, to me, \u201cThe Best and the Brightest,\u201d the title of his book about JFK.So, although I\u2019m reviewing \u201cThe Breaks of the Game,\u201d I\u2019m also reviewing Halberstam\u2019s amazing career in the hopes you\u2019ll see something else to read after this sports classic. You\u2019ll never run out of topics covered by Halberstam and you\u2019ll never regret reading anything he\u2019s written. I recommend this book and I recommend Halberstam."}, {"userName": "Sarah", "userReviewDate": "Mar 28, 2015", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/37156854-sarah", "userReview": "Dozens of small dramas make up this book. It's not just about the game of basketball, it's about all the people who make it happen -- players, coaches, wives, agents, reporters, owners, TV execs, etc. All of these stories come together to create a complete picture of what makes a professional basketball team really tick. It is a fascinating behind-the-scenes look at a typical season on a typical team. Having recently read Terry Pluto's Loose Balls, about the American Basketball Association, this book felt like a natural progression. Halberstam continues the theme of the evolution of pro basketball, from a game played for the sake of playing it into the television-ratings-driven commercial spectacle that it is today. Don't get me wrong, I enjoy watching the NBA, but it's a much different game than it used to be. And it's often a tough world for the players; a cutthroat (and frequently politicized) profession, in which a player is very likely to end up on a different team in a different city before the season ends. Halberstam gets into the whole machine, from high-school hype and college recruiting all the way to NBA contract negotiations, and of course, how all of this affects the players themselves. He depicts the players, coaches, and their families vividly and honestly, drawing the reader into their individual stories. The Breaks of the Game is an eye-opening read into the inner workings of not just a game or a league, but a culture."}, {"userName": "Chris Perry", "userReviewDate": "Mar 04, 2014", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/29299022-chris-perry", "userReview": "An expansive book ostensibly chronicling the 1979-1980 season of the Portland Trail Blazers, Halberstam (seemingly) captures the poetry of NBA basketball at the time. The best and most insightful parts came in discussing the minutiae of the game - what the trainer does day in and day out, how Weinberg, the owner, pursued negotiations with his arch-enemy and closest friend Howard Slusher (which may be the best name for a sports agent ever). I found the formatting of the book a little annoying. With practically zero chapter breaks, sections tended to flow together with only minimal demarcation. But this is a small quibble. Where this book is particularly illuminating to me is its dissection of race and class in the NBA up to 1980. In 2011, race and class issues still simmer beneath the surface, just look at the recent dust-up between Jalen Rose and Grant Hill, but it seems much less hostile and subversive. You can\u2019t help but empathize with guys like Kermit Washington or even Maurice Lucas. And that I think is the best part of the book: it forces the reader to see the athletes, from the benchwarmers to the stars, as human beings with emotions, moods, and problems like anyone else. Even 31 years later, I feel for these guys."}, {"userName": "Alex", "userReviewDate": "Apr 02, 2014", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/2127983-alex", "userReview": "In Breaks of the Game, David Halberstam explores the 1979-80 Blazers. Explores might be a strange word choice, but I'm not sure what else to call what he does. In telling the story of their season, he provides backstory on everyone from the President on down to the janitor. He gets to know the players, their wives, their agents, their 4th grade teachers. It is amazingly comprehensive, and gives what might be a rather blas\u00e9 season (a first round playoff exit) an epic lens, since we know what is at stake for everyone involved. I only give this 4 stars because at times the backstories could overtake the present intrigue. We spend more time learning about what makes coach Jack Ramsay tick then actually watching the ticking occur. But what also elevates this story to 4 stars is the fact that it is the most thorough examination of the circus of modern sports that I have read. Halberstam is at his best when he goes a little Vonnegut on basketball, looking at it from the perspective of the ultimate outsider, and marveling that this professional sphere even exists.

Halberstam uses a season with the Portland Trailblazers, a team in turmoil but still bearing a championship pedigree from just a few years before to examine every aspect of NBA life he can glean: contracts & money, the battles for jobs, the challenges of coaching & playing in the league over a long season, the strains it puts on people's personal life, dealing with injuries (and incidentally showing just how poor sports medicine was back then in comparison to today), the status of the league, and most critically the role and perceptions of race in the league.It's rather remarkable, just how deep Halberstam goes, driving well inside the psyche of most of the Trailblazer's roster and getting some impressively honest thoughts and statements from players and coaches about what they actually thought about the team and their place on it, the league and their place in it, as well as just broader thoughts about the world, especially when it comes to race. It's doubtful (especially with so much more money involved and every player having agents who would advise them on every aspect of their career, not just getting involved around contract time) that many would be so honest today. (A minor caveat: Halberstam often gets away from direct quotes to get inside players head about how they felt at certain times about many things. I'd say he's earned his reputation as a meticulous and accurate researcher to allow this, but some may wonder a little about how well he could know some of this)It's more than just a basketball book, although it's one of the best in that genre I've ever read, because of how seriously it takes matters of race. It looks seriously over racial divides in the league, on a team, between individual players, and even showing people facing buried racist attitudes (and some times not realizing they exist). The NBA has only become more of black league since then, so it would be fascinating to see just how some of these attitudes persist today and how things have evolved...but it's doubtful any writer would ever get this same level of access or honesty again."}, {"userName": "Corey Vilhauer", "userReviewDate": "Mar 19, 2018", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/304697-corey-vilhauer", "userReview": "A wonderful book about basketball players that starred in an era where there were few stars, before the sport went mainstream, in the middle of network stagnation. As life in the professional leagues adjusted to post-ABA life, with more money (but the same old gross hotels) and more games (but the same old broken knees), the Trailblazers were there to cling to the last remnants of their championship team. This is a book about how champions die, about how our bodies betray us, of how the growing salaries of young black players caused resentment from old white veterans and coaches - among all of the other dumb resentment they held via 70s race relations - and, finally, somewhere at the end, how the game was ready to explode into the spectacle it is today.

The look inside the players, families, coaches, executives, spouses, agents, sports media, TV deals, racism, drugs, and physical health kept me engaged throughout the story. By living and traveling with the team, it was obvious Halberstam was able to provide the reader with information and journalistic perspective no other writer could. Many of the story's multitude of characters still have relevancy in today's NBA so this book has held up quite nicely all these years later.

I read this one over a period of months just because it was so chunkily written. It was until I was past page 300 when I got engaged into some accounts of Billy Ray Bates coming to the team.

Not the easiest read, as it's a bit long, but it's really impressive nonetheless."}, {"userName": "Daniel Nelson", "userReviewDate": "Mar 09, 2018", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/3493314-daniel-nelson", "userReview": "Although not generally a subject I would be interested in (1979-80 Portland Trailblazers) this book stand out because it is classic Halberstam. Wonderfully written and constructed it explores much more than just the season of an NBA team. The story covers the league, society, race, power, money, sports, and human communication/relationships. The book stands on it's own because the writing is terrific."}, {"userName": "K.Haas", "userReviewDate": "Sep 04, 2017", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/61885221-k-haas", "userReview": "David Halberstam writes with incredible authority, taking you into the minds of the members of the Portrland TrailBlazers in a way that gives the season \u2014\u00a0otherwise not very notable by NBA standards \u2014\u00a0a crucial feel. The writing in \"The Breaks of the Game\" is both deft and authentic. Halberstam connects you with the characters so well that I found myself turning to Google on several occasions to find out what happened to players like Billy Ray Bates and Maurice Lucas after the story ended."}, {"userName": "Derek Nielsen", "userReviewDate": "Jun 01, 2018", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/82598851-derek-nielsen", "userReview": "This was the best 'insider' look at the NBA that I've read. Halberstam is a genius in that he can help the reader understand the complex personalities (and egos) of people in every facet of the game, from the superstars (Walton, etc.) to the bench players to the trainers to the owners. Great read for any sports fan."}, {"userName": "Josh Withers", "userReviewDate": "May 22, 2017", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/37849277-josh-withers", "userReview": "As a basketball fan, this was a fantastic book.

Join David Halberstam on his yearlong journey with the 1979 Portland Trail Blazers and witness professional basketball from the inside, where front-office egos, big-money contracts, and the colorful personalities of coaches and players collide, and winners and losers emerge. This insightful account is evidence of how much basketball has--and hasn't--changed since 1979, before the money really started rolling in.", "title": "The Breaks of the Game", "url": "http://www.goodreads.com/book/show/40193094-the-breaks-of-the-game", "average": 4.17, "cover": "https://images.gr-assets.com/books/1527000551l/40193094.jpg", "reviews": 233, "authors": [{"url": "https://www.goodreads.com/author/show/42850.David_Halberstam", "name": "David Halberstam"}], "type": ["Sports and Games", "Nonfiction", "Sports", "History"], "outlinks": ["http://www.goodreads.com/book/show/414062.The_Best_and_the_Brightest", "http://www.goodreads.com/book/show/75411.Summer_of_49", "http://www.goodreads.com/book/show/448135.The_Coldest_Winter", "http://www.goodreads.com/book/show/75408.Playing_for_Keeps", "http://www.goodreads.com/book/show/75418.October_1964"]}
