Sure, there were a few good life lessons included in its pages. However, the writing was mediocre and the story telling was terrible. The characters were unbelievable, both in dialogue and action. I was surprised that the characters didn't punch Jones for delivering these messages that go against the grain of their lives. While the messages were good ones, it was unbelievable that people would accept these messages right off the bat. No real contemplation, no real struggles, just quick acceptance of an old man's \"noticing.\"Also, I have to disagree with a couple of the lessons. Jones states that if you want people to like you, think about what it is that they would change about you. Some of the things I agree with, like reducing or eliminating cursing in your speech when talking to others or being more polite. But other things I can't agree with, like changing how you dress so that other people will like you more. Change how I dress so people like me? I think not. Some of this is individuality, not something that should be changed so that you can win a popularity contest.Overall, I felt preached at. The story wasn't very good and the lessons were driven home very forcefully. Not my cup of tea."}, {"userName": "Darbyscloset", "userReviewDate": "Apr 26, 2009", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/1628062-darbyscloset", "userReview": "\u201cThe Noticer\u201d by Andy Andrews, is a pleasant surprise of a read. The book illustrates a short story with a powerful punch; a story that I don\u2019t want to spoil for any readers of this review. I\u2019ll tell you this though, my husband and I participate in a highway clean up project sponsored by our township and when we first started he insisted that we pick up cans on the same side of the street and then pick up cans on the other side during the walk back, otherwise there would not be any cans for us to pick up during our walk back to where we started. I told him it wouldn\u2019t matter if I picked up cans going the same direction as he yet on the other side of the road, for there would still be cans for us to pick up on the way back, because we would be viewing the roadside from a different perspective. \u201cThe Noticer\u201d is about viewing our everyday lives from a different perspective and what a change in perspective can do to one\u2019s world.

It took me a few years to dig it out, but I am glad I did. This is definitely a short little gem of a book that I read in an afternoon. The Noticer has a vibe very similar to Mitch Albom. It is less story oriented, but more self help with key words of wisdom. I was immediately struck by the lessons it tries to teach in regards to noticing people's characteristics, noticing ways people love or need love - in particular your spouse. We do all speak and need different things and it is a great resource to learn and pay attention to those needs. But it also takes effort to apply them...as sometimes it is easier to just - do what we want!! Either way - this gives a lot to think about and I highly suggest it if you want to learn ways to be more connected to your spouse. So many good little tid bits to take away!!"}, {"userName": "Chelsea Ursaner", "userReviewDate": "Jul 13, 2012", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/3585516-chelsea-ursaner", "userReview": "Way too self-help for me and the writing was nothing special, but there were some definite gems within the book that I think back to sometimes. This is the primary one (so now you can move onto another book without hesitation.. sorry Andy Andrews). I'm going to just paraphrase the concept:In the same way that Americans and Scots both speak English but may as well be speaking different languages, there are different dialects to the language of love. People sometimes come across difficulties in their relationships because they give and receive love in a different dialect from the other person. Each dialect is represented by an animal.Dog - Verbal communication. \"Good dog/bad dog.\"Cat - Physical touch.Goldfish - Deeds and gestures. Goldfish don't need to be told they're loved, they just want you to feed them, clean the tank, maybe fix up the fake plants. This person can be told a million times that they're loved but it doesn't get through to them until they're shown it - a gift, cooking dinner, acts of selflessness/willingness to help. That's also how they show their love to others and may never say overtly how much they careCanary - Quality time. The canary displays its love through its song and presence, and in return it just wants to be heard and appreciated. This person cares about the amount of time spent together... just hearing that they're loved or having physical touch is not enough. They need to feel like they're doing things together, sit down and have meals together, etc."}, {"userName": "Jeanette Blackson", "userReviewDate": "Feb 14, 2010", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/1148487-jeanette-blackson", "userReview": "This is the first book I have read by author Andy Andrews and it will NOT be the last! I picked up this book free through Thomas Nelson's Book Review Blogger Club (well I actually downloaded it onto my Sony e-Book Reader). I was kind of hesitant to read it as I had not read anything by Andy Andrews, but once I picked it up I could not put it down. Andy is a great author and this book was an easy read. It was a shorter book (only 176 pages) but had a lot of good content and some great life lessons. I am still not sure if the story was a true story or not, but in the book Andy was the narrator and he is telling the story of Jones. At the beginning Andy is a homeless twenty-something with a bad look on life and not much going for him. Jones (an older homeless man) befriends him and has him start reading books about great people in history and teaches him how to be better liked (so people will enjoy being around him). After Andy's 180 attitude change things start looking up for him and Jones just disappears. About a decade later Jones is back in the picture and is helping others with their everyday problems (one couple is on the verge of divorce...another man is depressed and on the verge of suicide...another man is in financial ruin). The book goes on to tell the stories of these individuals and what impact Jones has made on their \"perspective.\""}, {"userName": "Lionel Valdellon", "userReviewDate": "Jan 21, 2010", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/3186602-lionel-valdellon", "userReview": "The Noticer by Andy Andrews is 156 pages of important life lessons wrapped within a feel-good, inspirational novelette. The lessons are thinly-veiled homilies spoken by the main character Jones to a cast of (unfortunately) flat, characters who barely resemble real people with real dialogue. Still, the book\u2019s lessons and overall message are positive, and Christian \u2014 without mentioning God too often. The book will appeal to mothers, grandmothers, fans of inspirational literature, and anyone who enjoys Hallmark greeting cards.The barebones story is about an elderly, white-haired man named Jones who appears in a small town over the course of many years, always helping people gain a broader perspective on their trials and their blessings. For example: A man is saved from worry when Jones reminds him to focus only on what can be controlled. An old woman with nothing left to live for is inspired to begin living purposefully after Jones tells her that everything one does has an impact on someone else\u2019s life.I have nothing against this type of inspirational material, mind you. My basic problem with The Noticer is that it would\u2019ve been better off as non-fiction prose rather than as a pseudo novel. After all, the characters are throwaway paper cutouts. The real meat here lies in the life lessons \u2014 the wise nuggets scattered throughout the novel\u2019s cliche-soaked melodrama and often cringe-worthy dialogue. Still, it\u2019s worth a quick read on the plane, and would make an excellent Mother\u2019s Day gift!Visit http://www.thenoticerproject.com for more information about \u201cThe Noticer Project.\u201d* * *Disclosure: The copy I read was a review e-book from the publisher Thomas Nelson, which has a lovely little blogger review program.

Move closer and Jones would tell you he\u2019s a man with a wealth of places to stay, friends who love him like family, and possessions meant to be shared.

By reading about the lives of great people, you can unlock the secrets to what made them great.\u201dAndy is the first of many people Jones will touch.

This book opens the door to such questions and many others. How important are the circumstances in your life or is your perspective your greatest obstacle?I once saw a toddler discover his hand. He moved his palm close to his face, eyes wide, and mouth open, intent on his flexing fingers. As I watched him, I felt envious of his ability to find delight in something I rarely notice. This book reminded me of that child and encourages me to look for new perspectives on everyday situations.Remember the song, \u201cBe careful little eyes what you see?\u201d Today, with the doom and gloom of the news media, I find myself needing vision correction in order to keep a positive focus. While reading this book, I realized Jones had a message for me too. \u201cWhatever you focus upon, increases.\u201d I\u2019m putting on my rose colored glasses; it\u2019s going to be a beautiful day and good things are coming my way!"}, {"userName": "Mike (the Paladin)", "userReviewDate": "Mar 30, 2012", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/2187043-mike-the-paladin", "userReview": "Okay, some will like this book much better than I. Some will love it, be moved and inspired by it.I'm not and never have been a fan of certain types of self-help books (who knows maybe I'd be rich and so on if I'd listened better....LOL, oh well). Mr. Andrews has written several books and based much of his writing on his 7 decisions. After his parents died he did (as in the book) spend some time homeless. This book purports to tell the story of how he came out of this life and came to his seven decisions, with the help of an old man who's been around a very long time and always seemed old. Other people know him by other names and when they see him they see another appearance than the writer.Mr. Andrews has been a comedian and now writes self-help books and is an inspirational speaker. I won't go into what I find annoying about the \"buck-up, be inspired, you can accomplish it if you just decide to\" school of writing/speaking but I'm just not that moved by it.If this works for you, great.

In the last chapter, I was throwing the book across the room, scrunching my hair thinking \"I could've done this.\" It was a more than disappointing read.Andy Andrews has an inviting writing style, more like listening to an old friend (albeit sometimes a know it all, annoying friend), but I found the other elements of the novel dismal. The characters were not believable to me. I wondered if any of them had a backbone to just stand up to someone invading their personal lives with unsolicited tidbits of advice. Half way through the book, I could tell what was going to happen, so when it did end up in this super tidy ending that is not realistic, I thought I would drowned in the cheesy oooziness of it all. In real life, there are no nice tidy endings where everyone wins. Even wise, old sages recognize that and they don't sugar coat it.

Have the issues in your life become mundane? Then take a journey into the book \u2018The Noticer: Sometimes All You Need is a Little Perspective\u201c by Andy Andrews.In this book, you travel through the lives of ordinary people who encounter a man named \u2018Jones\u2019. An unassuming character, but only at first. Once he engages you in conversation, you will never look at things in the same way again.Very similar to the character \u201cBaggar Vance\u201d in the film \u201cThe Legend of Baggar Vance\u201d, Jones enters the lives of several people from many different walks of life, some he approaches respectfully and some in a much more forceful way. His demeanor soon dispels the initial objection of his intended \u2018new best friend\u2019.During these conversations, many popular, modern day ideas are dispelled. Ideas such as \u2018experience being the best teacher\u2019 and \u2018don\u2019t sweat the small stuff\u2019 which have become household sayings are challenged and scrutinized by Jones\u2019 perspective as he engages you in the conversation.I must say that while I read (and re-read) this story, I often looked up and around me quietly expecting Jones to appear in my life.In these conversations, Jones addresses life issues such as the despair of a young orphaned man, the hopelessness of a couple on the verge of divorce, a man contemplating suicide, and the tender thoughts of an older woman withdrawn from a world she believes no longer needs her.I found wisdom in each of Jones\u2019 dialogues with these characters. My personal favorite new \u2018perspective\u2019 was \u2018the difference between a mistake and a choice\u2019 and the illumination of the most common \u2018love languages\u2019.I highly recommend this book to anyone who seeks authenticity. You will find life lessons that you may have already learned, lessons you may need to re-learn, and still more lessons you may need to be introduced to for the very first time.A movement has begun from the publication of this book. It is called \u201cThe Noticer Project\u201c.

When I began this book, it reminded me of The Five People You Meet in Heaven in that it's a series of chapters, each about meeting a different person.An old guy (\"Jones\") shows up around town, meeting people at pivotal periods and giving them just the advice they need to turn their life around. One of Jones's favorite sayings is \"You lack perspective,\" and he does have a knack of saying the right thing at the right time to people.Honestly, at first the book struck me as a bit gimmicky. If you've read Gary Chapman's Five Love Languages, that's the gist of the advice he gives one character. Another character seems to get the message from The Secret (although I haven't read that book, I've read reviews of it) that \"what you focus on increases.\"Other situations in the book seemed copied from positive-thinking-forwarded-emails (at least some I've gotten): a man asked to be buried with a fork because \"the best is yet to come\" (ie, dessert).I began trying to identify which book or feel-good concept would show up in each chapter, but thankfully the copy-catting didn't permeate the entire book.I can't join the book jacket praise that this is \"the best book I ever read!\", but if you're looking for a positive pick-me-up, try out this one. You will probably gain a little \"perspective,\" to quote Jones."}, {"userName": "Farnoosh Brock", "userReviewDate": "Apr 13, 2013", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/17483237-farnoosh-brock", "userReview": "Good story, makes great points but gets a bit too redundant.I loved Andy Andrews's The Traveler's Gift. I had no idea what was around the corner, and I know I am not reading page-turner fiction here but still, I wanted this book to have that quality so I can stay with it. I love Andrews's style of telling stories and making a great point or two across. Jones is a good strong character and I like the concept of PERSPECTIVE - yes, everything is indeed about perspective, no doubt about it - and the author does a fantastic job of bringing this point to the surface the first 30-40 pages.But then I wanted to know what's next. He goes on and on to give us different scenarios and each are unique so the shift in perspective that Jones, this character the author uses throughout, offers would be unique. I just lost interest half way through and had to force myself to read a few more pages.A 3 star for the creativity, the message of courage and hope and shifts in perspective, but not the page turner compelling read that I had hoped it would be.

How many seagulls are left?\"'Well ... four.\"\"No,\" Jones responded. \"There are still five. Deciding to fly away and ACTUALLY flying away are two very different things.\" \"Listen carefully to me. Despite popular belief to the contrary, there is absolutely no power in intention. The seagull may intend to fly away, may decide to do so, may talk with the other seagulls about how wonderful it is to fly, but until the seagull flaps his wings and takes to the air, he is still on the dock.

Jones has a knack for being at the right place at the right time and say the right things to those who need help the most. Jones would notice things, point out his wise observations to offer others a different perspective. For instance, Jones was sharing lunch with a friend. He asked the guy to describe his meal and the guy said he was sitting in the sand at the beach eating canned sausages and sardines. Jones, on the other hand, had \"surf and turf with an ocean view\" -- it's all about perspective. That's all I will say about the storyline so as not to spoil it for everyone.

After they all encounter a mysterious old man named Jones, their lives change. All because he allows them to see their lives and their futures with a different perspective. Just by asking them very simple questions, and leading them to see their problems from a logical perspective, they can begin to understand how to change those things they think are problems or obstacles.For several minutes, we both sat silently, watching the gulls soaroverhead, listening to the surf break on the beach. Then Jones began to gather the empty cans and place them in the plastic bag.

I dined on surf and turf with an ocean view.\" He slapped me on the back. \"It's all about the perspective.\" (p 15-16)One chapter touches on the principles of the Five Love Languages - illustrating 4 of those languages as animals.

The wisdom shared in these pages is great. The best nugget of the whole book was that their are 4 basic ways to describe the way people receive and show love. It helped me understand myself better and is a great tool to help with determining how to communicate with those around you better."}, {"userName": "Annette", "userReviewDate": "Sep 25, 2017", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/2619106-annette", "userReview": "This book's message has a religious undertone, although the author takes care never to attribute the actions of \"Jones\" with Jesus. It's similar to the popular Joshua series.Jones is an old man who is of unknown age, race or origin. He finds Andy living under the pier in a small Alabama gulf shores town and proceeds to teach him how to pick up the pieces and become successful in life.Andy doesn't see Jones for years until he returns to the town and be-friends a number of townspeople with serious relationship problems. Life lessons for those seeking perspective on how to \"step into the light.\"Simply written with little character development. It's a good choice for your church small group gathering."}], "description": "A new story of common wisdom from the bestselling author of The Traveler\u2019s Gift.Orange Beach, Alabama is a simple town filled with simple people.\u00a0 But like all humans on the planet, the good folks of Orange Beach have their share of problems \u2013 marriages teetering on the brink of divorce, young adults giving up on life, business people on the verge of bankruptcy, as well as the many other obstacles that life seems to dish out to the masses.Fortunately, when things look the darkest \u2013 a mysterious man named Jones has a miraculous way of showing up.\u00a0 An elderly man with white hair, of indiscriminate age and race, wearing blue jeans, a white T-shirt and leather flip flops carrying a battered old suitcase, Jones is a unique soul.\u00a0 Communicating what he calls \u201ca little perspective,\u201d Jones explains that he has been given a gift of noticing things that others miss.\u00a0 \u201cYour time on this earth is a gift to be used wisely,\u201d he says.\u00a0 \u201cDon\u2019t squander your words or your thoughts.
