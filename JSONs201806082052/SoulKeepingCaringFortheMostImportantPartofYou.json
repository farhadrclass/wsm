His book, The Life You've Always Wanted, had a significant impact on me. Soul Keeping was fantastic as well. Here are some takeaways: Hurry is the great enemy of the spiritual life in our day. You must ruthlessly eliminate hurry from your life. Arrange your days so that you experience total contentment, joy and confidence in your everyday life with God. I am responsible to take care of my soul not just for my own sake. The condition of my soul will affect the people around me, just as when my body is sick it can infect others who get too close. Our souls are on loan to us. One day, God will review with us what our souls have become. The next time you are dissatisfied speak to your soul, \"Why are you afraid, O my soul?\" Sometimes the smallest acts of sacrifices or self-denial can break up hard soil. Make small sacrifices.Page 151. Ruth Graham. When Ruth Graham died she chose to have engraved on her gravestone words that had nothing to do with her remarkable achievements. It had to do with the fact as long as we are alive, God will be working on us. She had been driving one day along a highway through construction. She finally came to the end of the long construction road where there was a sign which read, \"End of construction. Thank you for your patience.\" That's what is written over Ruth Graham's grave: End of construction. Thank you for your patience.\""}, {"userName": "Greg Taylor", "userReviewDate": "May 04, 2014", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/22575906-greg-taylor", "userReview": "My first thought was that I wondered why Dallas Willard was a focus when the book was not marketed that way on the cover and title. But then I realized how important it is to connect the main idea of the book with personhood and community, and that was perfectly embodied in the way Ortberg weaved in trips to \"Box Canyon\" where Willard lived. Willard died in 2013, and the book also details the end of Willard's life and a deathbed commission to Ortberg and friends. The book really explores the Christian, Jewish, and cultural definition and thinking about the soul but does not settle for some nebulous or vague notions about the importance of soul keeping. Soul keeping is the way we come closer to God. We take care of many other things in our lives with more effort than we care for our souls, and Ortberg's call -- that comes from wisdom of the Scriptures, the Holy Spirit, years of ministry experience, family episodes he relates, and sage mantras from Willard -- is to value the soul as the \"unceasing spiritual being with an eternal destiny in God's great universe.\" Compares keeping the soul with keeping a stream clear of gunk, trash, pollution so that the stream can carry direct relationship with God. The book has some innovations, such as an abbreviated way of quoting that does not include who said some quotes, which is jarring at first, and no footnotes but first lines of a quote in the back list of footnotes. This unconventional methods are a bit confusing to the average reader, but I can understand that the text reads more easily and unencumbered that way. The book is finally a powerful tribute to a soul-friend and the journey we are on as humans given a soul by the Lover of our souls, the God who made us."}, {"userName": "Elena", "userReviewDate": "Aug 20, 2017", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/4805062-elena", "userReview": "Open-heart surgery. That's the best way I can describe my experience reading this book. Ortberg is one of the authors that I appreciate most, for his gift of tackling deep and important matters of faith in an encouraging, authentic manner. But this book resonated with me at a whole different level. It has awakened in me a fresh hunger for Christ and a renewed realization of just how much I need Him. It redirected my eyes and soul to Jesus. Very much recommend it. But do note that it's not a lighthearted read, but it definitely is an uplifting one."}, {"userName": "Amanda Tranmer", "userReviewDate": "Apr 30, 2015", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/30780904-amanda-tranmer", "userReview": "GREAT.

It is part exploration of the soul, part exploration of sabbath, part celebration of the life and teaching of Ortberg's friend and mentor, Dallas Willard. I was most impressed by Ortberg's honesty about his own life, and found Dallas Willard's words to have a tremendous effect on me, even though they were mediated through Ortberg's writing.

Who wants trite advice when it comes to the deepest part of who you are? Ortberg does us a huge favor by being unbelievably honest about his own personal journey to help us along our own. His friendship with his mentor Dallas Willard forms the framework of the book, which might seem weird at first. You might assume this would mean it's more of an homage or a biography. It's not. Willard is the biggest force in shaping and forming Ortberg's soul journey in Christ and so it's natural and fitting that this friendship, from beginning to end, would help shape the book. But it gets better. Ortberg is remarkably candid about his own failures as a soul in process. It's refreshing and relieving to hear that great spiritual guides and minds have the same struggles that the rest of us do. And these aren't the \"I had a bad thought once\" kind of confessions. I was truly moved and encouraged by his candor. As well as challenged. Am I being that transparent? But the main thrust of the book is to help us understand our lives as souls. We ignore this aspect of our lives so often that language like this sounds fairly arcane. But it's not. To grow at all in Christ means that we must understand ourselves in this way and that we must take responsibility for how we treat and care for our souls in the same way that we reap the consequences, positive or negative, for the way we take care of our bodies. We cannot hear this encouragement too often. I give this one 5 stars not because it's a masterpiece or will be around forever. It might not. But for the impact it can give to a wide ranging audience in the smallest time possible I have read few books that are better. i would definitely pick this one up."}, {"userName": "Karen", "userReviewDate": "Apr 21, 2018", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/4697631-karen", "userReview": "\"You are only able to live in a way that really helps and loves others when your soul feels its worth.\""}, {"userName": "Stephanie", "userReviewDate": "Feb 04, 2015", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/11922365-stephanie", "userReview": "Topic is great.

Because I have been favorably impressed with his work in the past, I was eager to read Soul Keeping: Caring for the Most Important Part of You (2014). Ortberg is a pastor at Menlo Park Presbyterian Church in California, though he also trained as a clinical psychologist. Each of those facts are important background in this book about caring for the soul. Additionally, Ortberg was profoundly influenced by the work of Dallas Willard who in May last year. In many regards, this book is a festschrift to Willard. Not only are Willard's influences deeply felt, Ortberg went out of his way to weave many stories about the man, a welcome addition. Essentially, this short book is a study in how we care for the most important part of us our souls. At the outset, Ortberg seeks to define the soul so that the reader is able to proceed from a place of common understanding. Once he establishes what the soul is, he moves on to reviewing what the soul needs and eventually how the soul is restored. There were a few things that I particularly appreciated about this book. First, Ortberg does a commendable job of differentiating between the soul and the self. So often in modern thinking about mental health, we think only about the self, which Ortberg suggests is misguided. Rather, we should focus on the soul, which defines who we are in relation to God. In the world of Christian psychology where I do some reading and writing, this is an important distinction. Second, Ortberg effectively weaves in his understanding of the importance of spiritual disciplines. As one deeply influenced by Willard and involved in the Renovare conferences, he views disciplines as important. He discusses these in more depth in his book The Life You Always Wanted, though here they find an organic place. Finally, I really liked the last two chapters. Essentially, these deal with his final interactions with Dallas Willard. He discusses suffering and what he thinks it looks like to die well, looking at Willard as a model. On the whole, I would strongly recommend this book. I wish more \"Christian psychology\" and soul care would look like this book. It is deeply relational, hopeful, and grounded in the truth of the gospel. I received this book free from the publisher through the Book Look Bloggers book review bloggers program.

It starts with an important and revealing analogy, one I've heard a few times, The Keeper of the Stream. It is with this backdrop that Ortberg soon jumps to the core of the book: \"Your soul is what integrates your will (your intentions), your mind (your thoughts, feelings, etc) and your body (your face, body language, and actions) into a single life\" and hence, \"It's the most important thing about you. It is your life.\"The book is split into three sections:1. What the Soul is2. What the Soul Needs3. The Soul RestoredI found greatest benefit in the first two sections and particularly appreciated the sections that dealt with sin and how it wages war against the soul: \"Sin fractures and shatters the soul.\" It is in our fallen natures that our soul's are needy, needy for God, but often we seek other alternatives which constitutes idolatry.Ortberg shares his own struggles with keeping his soul set on God and provides some pointers through his own daily experience of how he has developed the habit of walking through his day interacting with God. Dallas Willard has played a pivotal role in Ortberg's life and understanding of how to care for one's soul. Throughout the book we are given the opportunity to share in many of their conversations on the topic which I enjoyed immensely.Ortberg has a very readable style, however, this is a book that challenges and provokes the reader to draw closer to the Lord as it is only \"with God\" that we can find true contentment.Highly recommended."}, {"userName": "Sten Bolander", "userReviewDate": "Aug 26, 2014", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/3120840-sten-bolander", "userReview": "What struck me most about this book was what influence Dallas Willard (1935-2013) had on the author. His quotes are so thought provoking. The theme throughout the book seemed to come back time and time again to needing to \"ruthlessly eliminate hurry from your life\" to truly take care of your soul. The quote that spoke most directly to me from Dallas Willard was, \"You must arrange your days so you are experiencing deep contentment, joy and confidence in your everyday life with God.\" The 15-minute devotional in the morning won't cut it, but one most aim to live each and every moment of the day to God's glory.

Then I realized I was on the chapter entitled \"The Soul Needs Rest.\" I took took a breath and said to myself and a dear friend \"I can not finish.\" She stepped in to lead, I took in with gratitude her grace, and my soul was revived.

The soul is the coolest, eeriest, most mysterious, evocative, crucial, sacred, eternal, life-directing, fragile, indestructible, controversial, expensive dimension of your existence.
