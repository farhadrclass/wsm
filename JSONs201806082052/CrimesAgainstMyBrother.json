The stories are set in the Miramichi region of New Brunswick. They are profoundly bleak, sad and disturbing. The characters are often beset by ill-health, alcohol, drugs and poverty; poverty not only in the economic sense, but of the soul, mind and spirit. The many characters in this book are complex and interconnected. If you wish to relax with a cheerful, light-hearted book, these gloomy events are not for you. Sydney Henderson (from Mercy Among the Children) has a small part in this book, but his influence is all pervasive. He is a deeply religious pacifist holding rigid beliefs; righteous, stoic and stubborn. He believes that one must turn the other cheek; that trials and hardship are sent to make one stronger. If you are lied about, to never seek the truth, as those who spread falsehoods or hurt your family will eventually suffer. The story centres on three young boys who are among those who torment Sydney. Having seen that his beliefs have led to sorrow and trouble for his family, they are determined to never be like him.  The boys are left stranded in the woods in bitter cold for three days. During this time they make a blood-brother pact to renounce religion, and always help and support each other in the future. Surely they will never turn out like the unfortunate Sydney. Two of the boys are hoping to inherit the wealth of an elderly man. Two of them are dazzled by the same young girl. This will lead to betrayal and lies. There is a puppet master, a junk dealer, pulling the strings, influencing and exploiting these young people among others .He also covets the old man's wealth which he schemes to get for himself. Running through Richard's novels is the theme of lies and rumours and their dreadful consequences. These lies are caused by greed, jealousy, ambition, bribery and also political and big-business exploitation .There is also the question is redemption ever possible. I read with dread, as there is a relentless downward spiral for the characters, and for the economy of the town itself. When betrayal and lies occur and you think situations cannot get worse, they do. This leads to environmental degradation, serious crimes, injuries, loss of health, loss of money, death, family breakup and general misfortune for all involved. At the end we see a glimmer of hope and happiness for some of the downtrodden."}, {"userName": "Terri", "userReviewDate": "Apr 16, 2014", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/5963725-terri", "userReview": "Review also found at http://kristineandterri.blogspot.ca/2...I won a copy of this book as part of a Goodreads giveaway in exchange for an honest review. I was thrilled as I am always looking for an opportunity to be introduced to a new (new to me) Canadian author.I am at a loss to describe my feelings about this book. While very interesting it certainly was a depressing read. I would not recommend this story to those who are looking for an uplifting happy read as this book does not deliver this and should be targeted towards those who appreciate a subtly tragic story.Centralizing around three \"blood brothers\" this story depicts the life of poverty and broken dreams in a dead end town. The reader experiences the downward spiral of all three boys as they become men and the ripple effect of their actions. I found myself identifying somewhat since I come from a small town and have seen much the same occur. Rumor become reality while the truth is never accepted.There was a large cast of character throughout this story and almost all were unlikable with their personal agenda coming before all. No more did I dislike than Annette who I thought was garbage from the beginning. Yet she never really had a chance and that I think was the point to the whole story. Sometimes circumstance has the ability to determine ones future whether good or bad.I will say that I am glad that I read this story and I enjoyed the message it conveyed but I do find myself a little depressed after reading it. I can not iterate enough that this story is not for those who want a happy or even somewhat happy story. This is for those who have the ability to think a little bit deeper than the words displayed on the page and the ability to see the message it conveys."}, {"userName": "Sarah Reicker", "userReviewDate": "Feb 18, 2016", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/51458179-sarah-reicker", "userReview": "Book started off promising as far as D.A.R. books go, and by that I mean we see some genteel maritime folk who are intelligent but limited in life because of the crushing poverty they are born in to. (Not promising to everyone, but to me I'm like hell yeah, gimme dat crippling debt and subsequent inner turmoil). Unlike his other books though, I found this one was more action based than character based. It seems less thought out than his other books. I think the same big themes were there: big ideas vs small town mentalities, big focus on religion and of course on man's hubris being his downfall. But then, it turns weirdly melodramatic, like everyone dates each other, they all get addicted to something, lots of murder, and all of this is happening within a group of 15 or so core characters so I'm just kind of thinking why the fuck does everyone in this friend group have such a shitty life?Now, to me David Adams Richards is still one of the greatest humans who ever lived, so this book is still pretty dope, good writing and what have you. I just prefer his slower books that give better insights into his characters because we have more time to watch them grow. For fans of Mercy Among the Children or Friends of Meager Fortune, the Jameson bros and Sydney Henderson get shout outs in this book."}, {"userName": "S.M.", "userReviewDate": "Apr 08, 2014", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/12579670-s-m", "userReview": "I think of myself as a Canadian, but I live in a big city and know nothing about life in a small town in rural New Brunswick - this is a window into that world. The narrator is five years older than, and a cousin to, the three main characters. The narrator was kept apart from the three cousins when he was a boy, and then he is further set apart by obtaining a university education and moving away to a big city. We look at the actions of the novel as the narrator does, from a distance.This novel is utterly heartbreaking, tragic, hopeful, and so perfectly, intricately plotted. Every event, and it seems, every object, has a place and is or will be part of the story in the past, present and future. Many in the town are poverty stricken, and money plays a great part in the story. Characters are so focused on getting, making, or keeping money that they lose sight of what should be more important to them - love of a friend, spouse or child. The beauty of their own landscape and the security of ongoing employment. Debt is an important theme - what people owe each other for good deeds and for bad. Story-telling - people in town gossiping or repeating a version of events that is not true, ruining the lives of others in the process is also something that runs through the novel. I am completely wrung out from reading this book. The character of Liam in particular broke my heart. Now that I have finished it, I want to go back and reread \"Mercy Among the Children\" as well as the author's other books.I am grateful to have won this book in a Goodreads First Reads Giveaway."}, {"userName": "Ted Dettweiler", "userReviewDate": "Dec 31, 2015", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/1297419-ted-dettweiler", "userReview": "This book got a little long for me. I suppose life starts to feel long lived under the conditions described in the novel. I didn't like it as much as most of David Adams Richards books. What all of his books share in common is believable characters. Maybe what was lacking in this book was a hero, or lovable character. I kind of felt bad for all the characters in this book because of the visible effects of the crimes (sin) perpetuated against them.If there is one thing that David Adams Richards excels at it is the skill of demonstrating that there is a societal sin that the whole community perpetuates against individuals. His books describe communities in the Miramichi region of New Brunswick, but there should be a David Adams Richards writing about my city as well, lest I think that societal sin is a phenomena of more rural communities. Lots of reality in these books - fiction that is distilled reality."}, {"userName": "kp", "userReviewDate": "Dec 21, 2014", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/5297582-kp", "userReview": "I liked this novel, but not as much as I've liked some of his other books. Mercy Among the Children was a near-perfect tragedy. This one was harder to read, and the interplay between action and consequence, love and betrayal, that Adams Richards excels at sometimes seemed forced compared to some of his other work. That said, he always delivers a profoundly clear-sighted view of the ways in which we fool ourselves and each other, and after I put down this novel, I found that certain characters and scenes stayed with me as if they are a stain that has worked its way into the grain of my imagination. And I can't think of many writers who speak with such a moving combination of rage and tenderness about poverty and the fates of the poor."}, {"userName": "Sherry Monger", "userReviewDate": "Jul 19, 2014", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/5548515-sherry-monger", "userReview": "Crimes Against My Brother is a dark tragedy of Shakespearean proportions. It revolves around three blood brothers living in a poverty stricken New Brunswick region. Betrayal, deception, ridicule, and gossip dominate their lives with grim consequences, as the three ruin themselves in addition to the ones they love.The novel is filled with keen insights into human behaviour - what happens when fragile self perceptions are subject to the vagaries of fate, hard times and the maliciousness of our baser nature.Not only are individuals subject to these forces, so too are the community, organizations, government and society.I am a David Adams Richards fan and have read his other novels.

I understand why people say his work is dark and depressing, but having grown up in a small town on the other side of the country, I simply find it to be true. People are like this. Gossip is a destroyer and miscommunication rips small towns apart. The facts stop mattering in DAR's books, only what people think, and that's what hits home for me.

It was as white as the purest soul, and as scattering as gossip.\u201d \u2014David Adams Richards,Crimes Against My BrotherThe latest book by Giller-winner David Adams Richards, Crime Against My Brother, revisits the author\u2019s vivid small-town, east coast setting with a slew of characters \u2014some familiar and much-loved, some new and provoking. The story begins with three youths making a blood-brother pact while stranded up on Good Friday Mountain during a winter storm. It is a pact of loyalty to each other and a renunciation of God. What ensues is a tale of betrayal that spans a couple of decades. Betrayal that is initially based on rumours, lies, and misconceptions. Betrayal that leads to infidelity, theft, and revenge. Betrayal that scars the soul and taints the lives of three blood brothers \u2014Ian, Harold, and Evan\u2014 and those they touch.Once again, Richards takes a moralist stance in his writing. He compares this pact with friends to a resolute pact with God. Their blood-brother pact was doomed from the start, because a pact among men is not as strong (apparently) as a pact with the Almighty. Sydney Henderson (a beloved character in Richards\u2019s Mercy Among the Children) is a God-loving soothsayer offering warnings that are ignored by the three youths. That said, fans of Richards should not expect the same magical feel that Sydney evoked in this new story. His appearance in Crimes Against My Brother is fleeting, and most of the main characters behave desperately on misguided instincts. None of them display Sydney\u2019s compelling, resolute principles. I cringed and felt sorry for the trio during their downward spiral, but I never seemed to root for them either. Their dark thoughts lead to unfathomable actions and anguish that test their renunciation of God. Coincidentally, after two work-related accidents and a fight, the three men each suffer from a back injury. An old fellow remarks on this twist of fate, stating, \u201cWhat do you think of that? \u2026 It\u2019s like they have to carry their crosses from now on.\u201d Is this old man expressing the author\u2019s view and intent? Possibly. One thing is certain: their sins are grave and forever link them together.Full review here: https://grandbarda.wordpress.com/2014..."}, {"userName": "Marc", "userReviewDate": "May 07, 2018", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/31231406-marc", "userReview": "D. Adams Richard est un des rares auteurs dont je lis syst\u00e9matiquement l\u2019\u0153uvre. Ce dernier roman n'est certes pas ma meilleure lecture. Il a une complexit\u00e9 qui rend sa lecture des plus laborieuses.

The characters in this novel...the situations they find themselves in...are the most depressing I have ever encountered...and in comparison to previous Richards novels, that is astonishing. I found nothing redeeming in these people, and their world viscerally ugly. On top of that, I found the underlying layer of academic smugness against those who never experienced such lives to be deeply unpalatable. Only the power of the writing kept me moving forward through this morass of dark inhumanity...a car crash so expertly described I simply couldn't turn my eyes away from the page. This is not a book that will deliver any happiness or redemption."}, {"userName": "Doreen", "userReviewDate": "Jun 18, 2014", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/8083149-doreen", "userReview": "This is the story of three troubled blood brothers. Evan Young, Ian Preston, and Harold Dew are actually cousins; as reckless proud teenagers they make a blood pact in which they \u201cchallenged one another to be heroic and loyal\u201d (16). Soon, however, they find they cannot remain loyal, and grievances deepen because each is manipulated into thinking one of the others has stolen either money or love from him and so destroyed his chance at a successful and happy future. \u201c\u2019It is awful to be betrayed, and it is just as bad to be accused of betraying friends when you did not\u2019\u201d (40). Over time, the three become bitter enemies, who \u201cseared by betrayal, needed revenge\u201d (156).There is no doubt that the men are responsible for their difficult lives. They make poor decisions and act impulsively and betray those they love. The author even suggests that betrayal is inevitable because, \u201cThe destructive forces in any friendship always end in betrayal\u201d (113). But there are external factors which contribute to their downfall. Chief amongst those is Lonnie Sullivan who reminds me very strongly of Iago in Shakespeare\u2019s Othello. He is a greedy, duplicitous, cunning manipulator who constantly whispers innuendos in the ears of the gullible. Of course, his innuendos are always couched in phrases that make him look innocent with only the wellbeing of the listener as his primary concern. Lonnie\u2019s manipulation of Annette Brideau illustrates the extent of his guile. At one point he tells her to marry Harold Dew: \u201cHe\u2019s a good man \u2013 and smart\u2019\u201d (58); later, he tells her, \u201c\u2019Then use what a woman has to get [Ian]\u2019\u201d (112). He gives contradictory advice because circumstances change and he advocates for the man whom Lonnie thinks will eventually be able to enrich him.Lonnie is aided in his machinations by gossip amongst the locals: \u201cBut there were rumours too, started at the tavern and other places where men while away time and charity\u201d (163). Virtually everyone in the novel is harmed by the malevolence of gossip, \u201csmall-town betrayal and gossip [in which] nothing ever really had to be true\u201d (177). Mean-spirited gossip certainly fuels the misunderstandings among the three men. Especially when a person\u2019s life takes a downturn, people \u201cdrift away and [say] the same cruel things about [that person] that [he/she] had said about others\u201d (343). For example, Sara, a doctor who returns to her home community after working with Doctors Without Borders with the poor in many places in Africa, is welcomed as a hero: \u201cPeople could not help liking her and wanting to be seen with her \u2013 for she had met Desmond Tutu, she had met Nelson Mandela. So then, in this dreary backwater, she was a blessing\u201d (309). Attitudes change when she expresses an opinion about abortion that does not match community values and people \u201cdid lessen her worth whenever they could\u201d and turn her into an outcast (311). The corrosive effect of malicious and misinformed gossip is a major theme in the book.The plot feels very contrived. Coincidences abound. People\u2019s paths cross by chance and lives are changed. A man bent on murder sees a childhood friend, remembers a conversation he had with her, and \u201cbecame ashamed, and turned and walked away with the shotgun well hidden\u201d (168). One chance meeting even results in an accidental death (205). Objects, a wrench and fur hat in particular, pass from person to person as if divinely directed. The author seems aware of these coincidences since he even addresses the issue directly through his narrator who says, \u201cOnlookers may think this a story where people are always thinking the same thing\u201d (188).Interestingly, the author also addresses his own reputation by referring to himself as \u201cthe author from their own town who . . . wrote troublesome things\u201d (310). A young boy comes across some of his books, \u201cbooks others in the town refused to read. He had heard so much of how terrible this writer was, how violent, that at first he himself wanted to throw them away. Yet he began to read this writer who people said they hated and . . . the world of his river open[ed] up like a terrible beautiful blossom that in its countless tragedy had hope of another bloom \u2013 and in this world of despair and darkness he saw much beauty . . . and the writer\u2019s love for them\u201d (333).This novel will do little to change that reputation as it is full of countless tragedy, despair and darkness. The book includes infidelity, theft, beatings, murder, heartbreak, loneliness, family disintegration, suicide, chronic pain, government ineptitude, environmental degradation, and corporate swindling. The whole is unrelentingly grim. I am an admirer of David Adams Richards; in fact, I have argued that his Incidents in the Life of Markus Paul should be required reading for all Canadians. I was, however, disappointed with this novel; at times I found it outright tedious. The constant rumours and envious grudges and the never-ending suffering become repetitive. The characters can be admired for their perseverance, but there is little else to renew my faith in humankind. I found it difficult to see the beauty in this world or the \u201chope of another bloom.\u201dThis is a complex novel and probably needs to be re-read in order to appreciate its layers; unfortunately, I cannot see myself re-reading it very soon. It is too depressing, and I need to find something more uplifting after this heartbreaking tale.Please check out my reader's blog (http://schatjesshelves.blogspot.ca/) and follow me on Twitter (@DCYakabuski)."}, {"userName": "Jess", "userReviewDate": "Mar 23, 2014", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/29591712-jess", "userReview": "I won a free copy of this book through a Goodreads' first reads giveaway.I have given this book three stars because, while beautifully written, the story wore on me after a while. Set in a fictitious rural New Brunswick town, this novel focuses on three boys, bound together as blood brothers at a young age, and follows their lives (and the lives of those close to them) into their adulthood.As their lives progress, the three main characters' stories drift apart and intertwine at varying points....sometimes when it seems they couldn't be further apart, they are linked in the most remote and tragic ways. It is this ongoing interconnected tragedy that eventually sucked me out of the narrative and prevented me from getting totally lost in this book.The writing itself is wonderful .... the pace and the little descriptive comments at just the right moments kept me engaged. Some of the plots operating mainly in the background - such as the struggles of a small rural town fighting to keep its mill - added the right undertone to the story lines operating in the foreground.Unfortunately, for all its positives, this novel devolved into what I described to a friend as unabashed \"Giller bait.\" The author heaped misfortune upon misfortune to the point that these moments ceased to be tragic and instead became ridiculous. Only so many coincidences can align every awful thing in a small community before the whole pity-party butterfly effect wears a little thin. While, in some respects, an excellent book, the sum of \"Crimes Against My Brother\"'s parts was too much for me. While it's interesting to explore the varying crosses each character comes to bear, I felt the book got a little carried away in developing all the pain and misfortune each character has to endure."}, {"userName": "Hayley", "userReviewDate": "May 22, 2014", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/4833526-hayley", "userReview": "received an Advanced Reader's Copy of this book through Goodreads First Read program, so I thought I would share my thoughts (which were not required as a condition of receiving the book). This book had the same warm feeling that I got from certain movies now and then, stand by me, etc. so once I started it was hard to put down. The narrator was very well written and discussed things with a childlike attitude and viewpoint. The book is all about three friends named Harold, Evan and Ian. One day when they get abandoned in the woods the boys become blood brothers and make a pact to always be there for each other. The book was told through two different time pieces one in present day and the other in the past. I wasn't a big fan of the jumping around but I loved how the author made each switch very noticeable and very simple on the reader. As the boys become grown men their lives all go on very different paths but this book shows the connection that they still have, and the stresses that their friendship causes as each boy is completely different. I feel that this book reminded me a little bit of the novel Huck Fin. Lots of attention to detail and such a good story all within a simple setting, which makes it hard to describe and still sound appealing. The main characters were super enjoyable and I loved the moral conflicts that you as a reader see them go through. While I sometimes found the story a bit hard to follow the writing was wonderful. Beautiful in an almost poetic sense of the word. What I didn't like about this book it no matter how hard I tried as I got near the end it became harder to finish.

But, from that moment on, they continued to mistrust each other, made false assumptions & accusations about each other and basically lived a selfish, crappy life with money being the ultimate goal to ensure happiness.

The lives are so raw here, but I struggle to place them in the real world. I get an image of how I imagine them living, and then the author adds some contradictory detail about their lives because he's looking to make a point. Often the characters seem the most desperate of the poor, people who have lived their lives without ever having been to a movie, then at other times they seem more ordinary everyday working class.

I had a little trouble getting into it at first but I am grateful that I stuck it out because the story is very good. I found myself thinking about the charterers before bed at night. This book really got into my head and made me think. I enjoyed the challenge of the book and the themes of luck and religion really pushed my own thoughts. The only thing I struggled with was the language, I felt like with the language used was better suited for an earlier time period. I think that was what made it difficult to get into. I would and will recommend this to others."}, {"userName": "Christine", "userReviewDate": "Apr 15, 2014", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/16497650-christine", "userReview": "I received this book for free via a Goodreads giveaway.Crimes Against My Brother was a tough book for me to get through. I found the sentence structure and overall writing style a bit offbeat to start with, then after about a half hour of reading I was into the flow of things. This book gave me a lot to think about, mainly with regards to adults and their relationships with children. The way Lonnie was seemingly able to orchestrate events through simple suggestions was quite alarming, as was the overall theme of greed, money and power. This was a very dark book for me to read, however I was glad to have had the chance to read a Canadian author."}, {"userName": "Rick", "userReviewDate": "May 24, 2014", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/28718038-rick", "userReview": "This book is very sad, disturbing and brilliant. Its recounts the story of three young men who become blood brothers one night in a severe storm. Interestingly this relationship seems to be part of their spiral downward. I love the way David Adams Richards writes. His characters are interconnected in ways that make you feel that all of what happens to them is inevitable. This book is a great read and I highly recommend it. Just don't start it is you are feeling a little down. It's brilliant but it won't pick you up."}, {"userName": "Chris", "userReviewDate": "May 15, 2015", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/4972715-chris", "userReview": "Early in David Adams Richards\u2019 latest novel, his narrator notes that his three strong, male, blue-collar rural protagonists are \u201csmarter, more resilient and more joyful\u201d than his middle-class, left-leaning students.

The Crimes Against my Brother was a wonderful novel that is true to Richards narrative writing style.

There were a lot of ideas in it that I disagreed with, but I can't argue with its very adept execution. (However, when you're done reading this you might want to watch a nice, light movie, like \"Beaches\" or \"Old Yeller\". It's not as long as a Russian novel, but it does remind you that we have a somewhat similar climate here in Canada.)"}, {"userName": "Mauberley", "userReviewDate": "Aug 27, 2014", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/4160725-mauberley", "userReview": "A fine novel of the old tradition. The book is serious study of sin and evil in the lives of men and women of the Miramichi in New Brunswick. In Richards' world, every act has a consequence although that consequence might not be immediately revealed. (N.B.. 'Consequence' is not the same as 'karma'.) Some may feel that the author's reliance on consequence is preposterous (or, less pejoratively, Dickensian) but everything in the world of this novel makes sense and I enjoyed it very much."}], "description": "Howard, Evan and Ian are inseparable as boys--so much so that one night, abandoned in the forest by the careless adults around them, and raging against society and the uncaring gods others worship, they seal their undying brotherhood with a blood bond. But soon after, a horrific accident scars each of them in a different way, testing their bonds and leaving each with a debt to be paid. As adults, seeking to rise above debt and advance in life, each man decides upon a very different path--but over time, all three discover they are tied to each other in intricately tangled, sometimes violent, and surprising ways that none of them has been wise enough to foresee.\u00a0\u00a0 In Crimes Against My Brother, literary legend David Adams Richards is at his finest, reprising some of his most complex and beloved characters (such as Sydney Henderson from Mercy Among the Children), introducing unforgettable new ones (such as the beautiful but fatally foolish Annette Brideau; and the wily, charming, money-hungry manipulator Lonnie Sullivan), and weaving a tale of such force, gravitas, complexity, universality, and compassionate understanding that he reaffirms his status as a master storyteller who has, book by book, used his rare genius to create an entire, teeming universe alongside a river in a small northern part of the world.", "title": "Crimes Against My Brother", "url": "http://www.goodreads.com/book/show/17262221-crimes-against-my-brother", "average": 3.62, "cover": "https://images.gr-assets.com/books/1398024543l/17262221.jpg", "reviews": 45, "authors": [{"url": "https://www.goodreads.com/author/show/87458.David_Adams_Richards", "name": "David Adams Richards"}], "type": ["Fiction", "Cultural", "Literature"], "outlinks": ["http://www.goodreads.com/book/show/151381.Mercy_Among_the_Children", "http://www.goodreads.com/book/show/1110344.Nights_Below_Station_Street", "http://www.goodreads.com/book/show/1110346.The_Friends_of_Meager_Fortune", "http://www.goodreads.com/book/show/1110347.River_of_the_Brokenhearted", "http://www.goodreads.com/book/show/1425484.The_Bay_of_Love_and_Sorrows"]}
