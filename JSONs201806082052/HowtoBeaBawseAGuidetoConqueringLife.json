I mean, look at it. Look at the cover. Look at the title. Look at the made up word, \u2018\u2018bawse.\u2019\u2019Are you kidding me? But despite the cheesiness and silliness that sometimes arises, it is a precious self-help book. It really does give helpful advice and motivates you to wake up at 6 am in the morning to conquer life.It\u2019s also surprisingly honest. I had no idea who this YouTube sensation was before I started reading the book. And I only cared to check her out when she began talking about her struggle with depression. I, like a lot of people, love inspirational stories. To me, Lilly Singh was born to make videos and inspire others. She talks about how she made her first YouTube videos in 2011 because she wanted to cheer herself up. Not because she wanted to become rich and famous, but because she needed to fight depression. She also discusses how sometimes a failed attempt to climb a business or personal ladder can end up opening new doors. Like when she was supposed to meet a celebrity to make an important video that meant a lot to her, but the meeting never happened. Still, that didn\u2019t keep Lilly from developing her idea, even if she had to trash her first plan. Even if she had to find another way.I agree. I absolutely agree. If everything went as planned all the time, and no one ever failed at anything, life would be\u2026 dull. We need to push ourselves and encourage ourselves and make mistakes to be able to grow \u2013 and, in my opinion, that should be everyone\u2019s number one priority. I want to see people change for the better and dodge the icebergs life puts in their way. I believe that\u2019s possible. Otherwise, there would be no inspirational stories to tell.

If you want to hear an honest review about the content of the book, continue reading below:Overall, this was a quick and simple read. Each of the 50 chapters are short and to the point, maybe 5 pages each at most. However, I also thought this may have been one of the reasons I couldn't give the book a higher rating. Singh offers a lot of great advice and mini pearls of wisdom, but as soon as you start processing the lesson, the chapter ends. Before you know it, the book is over and your head is swirling with just fragments of advice.In the chapter, \"Send the GPS Deep\", she states \"When it comes to understanding our behavior and why we do the things we do, I believe each of us has a minimum of three layers....the bottom layer consists of the deeply rooted reasons we actually behave the way we do.\" When Singh first announced her book, I was excited to read it and support her because I have been a long-time fan. However, I assumed the book was going to give us a deeper glimpse of who she is off-camera aside from the unicorns, skittles, and T-shirt references. I hoped she was going to provide the reader more insight into her third layer. At times she did do this, especially in the \"Out of The Blue\" concluding sections, but other than that the book remained largely surface-level. I can assume this is because she deeply values her privacy, and even alludes to that in the chapter \"Be Secretive.\" But I can't help but feel that if she expanded on her advice over a few more pages per chapter instead of sticking to the strict formula of opening metaphor-real world example-conclusion, and was willing to be a bit more vulnerable, that the overall tone of the book would have felt more substantive and personal. However, I do recognize that this is her first book and applaud her for keeping true to herself and her style....and just an FYI: if you are considering buying the book, I would definitely purchase the hardcover version instead of the ebook. Every chapter begins with a wonderfully colorful picture and title page. The ebook version hampers the reading experience in that sense because it just simply doesn't do the layout justice. (Also, I believe she has actually signed many of the hardcover versions). #OneLove"}, {"userName": "Trang Tran (Bookidote)", "userReviewDate": "Mar 27, 2017", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/43423597-trang-tran-bookidote", "userReview": "THIS BOOK IS GOLD. IT HELPS ME SO MUCH. Just when I needed it the most, reading this book is like having Lilly near you as a friend and a supporter to reassure you and guide you through your life. I believe we all learn best from our own experience and this memoir a personal coach speaking from her own experience and the result is amazing.The writing? TOTALLY HONEST TO HER STYLE. It\u2019s funny, witty and familiar. She doesn\u2019t need to pretend to be someone else, speaking like Shakespeare or whatever. She goes straight to the point and backs up her advice with her own examples and experience.It\u2019s like a voyage into yourself that you\u2019ve been delaying for years because you didn\u2019t know where to start. Well you start with this book right here. Lily reminds us that even though she reached stardom, she was still an ordinary person like all of us. She started from the bottom and people tend to forget that. So her problems and tips are easy to relate to. Dealing with your impulse, with hatred and arrogant people, how to not procrastinate, and my favourite thing ever.. SHE MADE A LOT OF GAME OF THRONES REFERENCES :D . She usually uses the characters to describe how they also apply the behaviours and how they overcome it through a fun psychological analysis.You can read my full review here : https://bookidote.com/2017/03/27/how-...Trang - Book Blogger http://bookidote.com"}, {"userName": "\u2618Misericordia\u2618  \u26a1\u03df\u26a1\u03df\u26a1\u26c8   \u2742\u2764\u2763", "userReviewDate": "Nov 09, 2017", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/6603759-misericordia", "userReview": "Punky enough to get to my reading list. Not coherent enough to get a higher rating from me. All the Youtube references soon got irritating (if I want Youtube, I won't be reading a book, I'll switch to Youtube, thank you). All the graphics were a bit much too much. Generally, I prefer my books to be more well-rounded and substantial. This book had a hell of a lot of promise and underdelivered in a drastic way. The girl spends entirely too much time on internet and videos. I do realise it's her work but it shows and not in a good way. Initially I kicked myself for not checking the author's age thinking the author is not mature enough, Z-generation, etc. But then I checked the gal's profile and saw she's about 29, which in my opinion should have provided her with enough lifetime to learn how to be coherent.I loved the book cover, liked the unicorn references, the photo with Malala and Rock, uhhh..., also liked some Q's (pls see those below :)) Disclaimer: I am not a fan of any Youtube stars. I don't even like Youtube and consider it a major waste of time. I just liked the punky stype of the book and decided to give it a try. We didn't click. Too bad. Q: A Bawse is like a boss, but so epic that I had to change the spelling. Unlike a boss, who is defined as such only within the workplace, a Bawse is someone who excels in both personal and professional settings. A Bawse exudes confidence, turns heads, gets hurt efficiently, communicates effectively, and hustles relentlessly. (c)Q: I\u2019m not writing about mythical, fairy-tale stuff. I\u2019m telling you what has actually worked in my life, the things that pulled me out of a place of deep depression into a life filled with the kind of success I couldn\u2019t have ever imagined. (c)Q: Being a Bawse is hard work. It requires an unfathomable amount of dedication and hustle. The following pages do not contain tricks, quick tips, or get-rich-quick schemes. I\u2019m not going to tell you about any shortcuts or good luck charms. Instead, I am going to make your work ethic sweat, your mind expand, your fear dissolve, and your obstacles crumble.

I enjoyed her story about Selena Gomez and the importance of authenticity ... but of course she wasn't going to bring attention to all the ways Selena Gomez is highly problematic including her bullshit Indian/\"Tribal\" cultural association bullshit that pissed the Desi community off a while back. Oh, and the picture of her with Scooter Braun elicited a similar reaction - he's the idiot that basically excuses everything Justin Bieber does, no matter how heinous, but of course he's a \"nice guy\" and they had such an \"authentic interaction\" and blah blah blah.Unnuanced. Annoying. Cloying and desperate. I eye-rolled my way through this whole mess. I gave it a star because the pictures are pretty. Honestly, read the name of each chapter, maybe the occasional pull quote, and you'll get the whole message of the book. This is not rocket science; the vast majority of the text reads like filler.

Ever since then, I've laughed and truly enjoyed watching her content, seeing as she's grown into a powerhouse in the YouTube community. I remember a period of time where I watched a collection of her videos before I went to bed every night because they relaxed me enough to go to sleep. She made me discover the side of YouTube where creators roam and helped me know what to watch in that field (Jenna Marbles, Miranda Sings/Colleen Ballinger, and Grace Helbig are examples).So when she announced this book, it didn't come as a surprise to me even with getting incredibly overjoyed. I knew this book was going to impress me even if it wasn't the best. So with that in mind (and the help of a gift certificate), I set off on the journey to becoming a full-fledged Bawse.I'm incredibly happy to say that this book was well worth the wait. With Lilly's charismatic voice and lovely advice, I feel empowered to change some of the aspects of my daily life and make it better. You can tell how much she cares about this project alongside her other endeavors, and I loved hearing about some of her experiences in life. The book design is pretty and organized, plus I appreciated how pretty the layout was. There was even a nice amount of repetition of earlier stated principles that didn't feel annoying! I do wish some of the individual chapters were longer since they felt a bit too short, but I feel like that's more of a nitpick for a truly wonderful read that I've been anticipating for a good long while now. In the YouTube community or possibly giving us more literature, I'm excited to see where Superwoman will take her magic next.9/15/16 (Before Reading)I legit fanboyed SO HARD when I heard about this announcement.

I am a big fan of hers and I watch all her videos.That being said, I do NOT worship the ground she walks on. I'm NOT approaching this book and review as a fangirl and I am NOT approaching it as a biased party. Part of this may have to do with the fact that she stated in a video several years ago that she doesn't believe in global warming. I don't know if this opinion has changed as of late, but it made me lose some respect for her.I think this book is genuinely a great idea.In this book, Lilly discusses how to be a BAWSE; a strong confident person who takes charges of their life while at the same time genuinely being a good human.It's not particularly unique. There are many psychology books out there that discuss the Mindset behind successful people.Most of those books go into the science behind it all.Lilly goes into the theory in practice. All the things she discusses are applications in her daily life. She shows the reader that these applications have worked for her and aided her in her successful career that started from virtually nothing.The other thing to remember is that most of Lilly's fans are all just regular young people. Most of them aren't just gonna go pick up a book on psychology to help them improve their lives. They will turn to YouTube and the internet!The beauty of this book is that it's written in a very clear fashion that anyone can understand because Lilly uses all kinds of metaphors, specifically social media related metaphors that most of her fans and young readers can relate to.Also, Lilly has a degree in psychology, so as far as I'm concerned, she is actually qualified to discuss the topics she does in her book because she has the proper education.Seriously do you expect a young person who spends a lot of time on their phone AND who doesn't like to read to pick up a book on psychology to solve their problems if they need help?Of course not.But when it's another young person who is widely loved and has a lot of influence in the online community who writes this book, then they will be more inclined to pick it up. Lilly has a lot of power and she does great things with that power.So I would argue that this book is going to help a lot of people in their life journies, not just because of what Lilly wrote, but because it was Lilly writing it.I also loved how How to Be a Bawse has little interactive portions in it. At the end of each chapter, Lilly gives the reader a challenge to complete that acts as a small push in the direction of self-improvement.Aaaaaaand here are some gifs of Lilly to conclude!"}, {"userName": "Manisha", "userReviewDate": "Dec 11, 2017", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/29882975-manisha", "userReview": "Actual review: 1.75This was the kind of book that is entertaining but hollow. The 'pearls of wisdom' are really just a few sayings here and there that seem good when you listen to it in a hilarious voice, but without that element, it falls flat. The humour was the only (somewhat) redeeming quality of this book that stopped me from giving it a one star review. It lacks depth and it lacks interest. It makes it seem like barely any effort went into creating this book. It's far from memorable. Even as I write this review, I'm struggling to remember anything about the book I just read.

I could finish this book in one day because-1. I was apparently so desperate for any form of motivation that I resorted to an illustrated book filled with platitudes whose targeted audience seems to be teenagers who have way too much money to spare.2. This book was more like a series of 10 minute YouTube videos than a profound piece of literature. I didn't learn anything I didn't already know from this book except for the fact that it wasn't written by a ghostwriter because I could hear her annoyingly perky voice in each sentence of the book. I didn't expect it to be great but I had hoped, and this is what probably made me impulsively pre-order the book, that she would talk more about how she overcame her severe depression and turned into this major internet personality. However, she downplayed this a lot, focusing on making badly placed and framed pop culture references to be #relatable and in doing so severely undermines her readers' intelligence (or maybe not, I guess I deserve the flak I'm getting for bothering to read this book)."}, {"userName": "Yodamom", "userReviewDate": "Jun 01, 2017", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/2905141-yodamom", "userReview": "2 starsQuick too simple chapters.

I hope I managed to do justice. This is the second book by a You Tuber that I'm reading and I have to say, I am definitely glad I picked this up.Adult life is messy, between your professional and personal worlds you are caught in this whirlwind and stuck in this maze, trying to figure your way through it. For a young adult it can be all too much and all too easy to simply lose your way.This is a book for every young adult with stars in their eyes, to take life by its horns and reach for the stars. Be it your personal life or your professional, lilly has something to offer that I am sure will change your life.My moment of epiphany:So if you\u2019re drowning, keep your life jacket on and fight. But once you\u2019re able to swim, don\u2019t convince yourself you forgot how to. Take your life jacket off, front-crawl your way to the shore, walk off that beach, and set your GPS to the top of a hill, because you WILL conquer the climb.If you\u2019re going to do it, do it the best you possibly can.There is a saying, When the student is ready, the teacher appears. I just needed someone to tell me this. I needed someone to remind me that I am meant for so much more.If you see, there's a uniform pattern that emerges throughout my adult life. All my coaches, teachers, mentors are constantly riled by the fact I seem to have so much talent but am unable to perform. My boss keeps asking me what's holding me back and how he can help me get better and I never know what to say. As far as I know, I am working the hardest I can and giving my very best. I hardly understand what he means when he says, my best is not enough. I can hardly believe, there is a higher level beyond me. But I think, I now know what he meant. I think, I had just forgotten what it meant to be confident, what it meant to win, to be a bawse. I had just forgotten.Just because I know how to swim now, doesn't mean, that's all I can do, I also know how to climb a mountain. I remember that now.Yes, I hit a low. Yes, I am doing really well now. But It's time for me to take-off that life-jacket and climb that mountain now.And similarly, I am sure, you will have your own takeaways from the book. This is a gem of a book, a true guide to conquering life by an incredible person. What I think makes this book, even better is the fact that, her work ethic, her genuine authenticity, her struggles early on in life with mental health, her being a self-made person, her being a really kind person whose single purpose in life is to make this world a better place, make her a very relatable and inspiring person.

friend went to Lilly's show and got this book. She gave it to me as a birthday gift, and until now I haven't had the time to read it. I finished it in a few days (it was so hard to put down because it's so good!).Lilly's an amazing YouTuber. She's also an awesome writer. And a great Bawse.Lilly's a very successful person and she has lots of friends who are super successful as well. In this book, Lilly shares her secrets to success and talks about things that happen in her friends' lives. Lilly mentions that Lindsey Stirling (love her!) still takes violin lessons! I never knew that and I was very surprised.Lilly used to have depression. If she hadn't mentioned it, I wouldn't have known! She's always so cheerful and funny in her YouTube videos. I'm really inspired by her story.One of the things I love most about this book is the length of the chapters. Each is about 5 pages long, which makes is perfect for me, because I'm a very impatient person. When I read books with loooonggg chapters that just go on and on, I get the urge to yell \"get to the point\"!AND ALSO. THOSE COLORFUL PHOTOGRAPHS OF LILLY! LOVE 'EM.

I haven't read any of them, but I picked up Lily's book because I do watch her channel on occasion.There is nothing new or life-changing in Lily's book. She gives out some good advice, but the book reads like a Cliff's Notes edition, each chapter is very short and when you start to grasp what she is saying, the chapter is done. If felt like more of a photo shoot with brief stories in between. Yes, the photos were colorful and interesting, but they were fillers for a subpar self-help book.Her die-hard fans will buy the book to support her, but we're not getting any bookworms out of it.Perhaps her next book, if there is one, will be a little more substantial."}, {"userName": "Ritu Raveendran", "userReviewDate": "Jun 11, 2017", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/8734607-ritu-raveendran", "userReview": "A Self help book for someone who DOES NOT like Self help books. Someone like Me. \n Lilly Singh is pretty entertaining and one of my favourite YouTuber but I admit that I  NEVER expected that I would read her book because -1. I dont like Self help books, they are just downright boring and I ve noticed that It doesn't really motivate me long enough to follow it through.2. I never considered Lilly Singh mature enough to be writing a self help book in the first place ! 3. I have a Mom ! Who takes that job very seriously, I get lectured every other day .\n   Why I picked up this book \nSo coming to why I picked up this book is because I saw it at this bookshop and its got a magazine like appearance with glossy pages and loads of funny pictures inside,the first page of this book intrigued me because it said -  The book is not a survival guide filled with hopeful thoughts,lucky charms or fluffy quotes. There will be no secret schemes to a rewarding life found in these pages. Thats because success, happiness and everything else that feels great in life have no escalators. There are only stairs. This book will be your personal trainer, guiding you up those stairs. Start Stretching .  What I felt about this book  The writing style is very original and Lilly like so much that I pretty much read the whole book in Lilly's voice, Its not pretentious at all but the content isn't very insightful, I loved the examples and real life situations she put up and the way she handled it. The book is meant for someone in their late teens to age thirty because there is a lot of Pop culture reference and Social media fad content which might be hard to relate for someone who isn't updated with any of these. Conclusion  Most content of this book isn't new , it isn't something you have never heard of before from your Parents,teachers,relatives or even friends but what makes it unique is how Lilly presents it and makes it all motivating and funny at the same time with her quirky ways . It is Immature and the writing style isn't very fancy but then I wouldn't have finished the book ever if it wasn't like that in the first place . There is zero value added but then there is no shortcut to success as per the book, It has a Practical and a go getter approach rather than the introspect and learn version that most self help books offer."}, {"userName": "May\u035ba", "userReviewDate": "Nov 04, 2016", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/20624450-may-a", "userReview": "My favourite Youtuber is going to write a book and I so cannot wait!!

It was a \n   self-help/autobiographical \n book written by an \n  international YouTube star \n. Neither of the categories enticed me to shell out 700 INR for some random wisdom by a person whose videos I occasionally watched when I was killing time. But then the universe conspired, and a mention of this book would prop up every time I opened my Facebook feed. The cover looked powerful, and Lilly had become successful enough to be a Forbes 30 under 30. The way I had been idling away my vacation, I thought I might as well give it a try. At the worst, I had the free pass to seethe out criticism in my review.And slowly, as I turned through the pages, Lilly Singh turned out to be my role model. I wanted to be a Bawse in every sense. The book is a blob of colour in the black and white world of self-helps. The drudgery of the genre has thoroughly been washed away with waves of humour and relatable metaphors. The latter (which includes a lot of Game of Thrones and desserts) not only makes the content interesting, but also makes abstract lessons easy to understand. This isn\u2019t the voice of a writer preaching her sermons through a magnanimous image of herself projected in the pages, instead you find a normal human narrating how she tackled her instinctive, everyday problems to be her best self. She seems very real; her struggles are brought out at intervals, mirrored with the transformation we\u2019ve largely known, that instils the feeling of practicality in the \u201cadvices\u201d. That\u2019s probably one of the best things about the book-it is very action oriented; Lilly combines her learnings from her YouTube journey and her psychology major to add credibility to it. Of course, for a genre that is inundated with books of \u201chow tos\u201d for the minutest of things (of which certain categories have been exploited to death), not everything written in the book is new and innovative. That did not disappoint or unnerve me because somewhere, I was already reading it with such expectations. However, it is not totally redundant either. There are some pearls of new wisdom to be often found in the pages, put forth very nicely; some other pearls of olden rules have been modernized and polished to perfection. To make it easy to follow, the book has been very well structured and is divided into coherent parts. The other commendable part of the reading experience is the book design itself. It feels like you are reading a magazine or a coffee table book- the pages are glossy and vibrant, with a bright colour theme. Inserted between the chapters are certain quotes written on a coloured background, which could be easily torn and used as a poster. The colours also reflect the mood-e.g. the part where Lilly talks about her depression phase is printed with a blue background, while the subsequent transformation is done on a bright yellow one. Like Lilly Singh herself, every element of the book exudes a contagious enthusiasm and is truly inspiring. That being said, the book was just near perfect. The jokes sometimes got in between the reading experience or were too bland to sound funny, and some chapters could easily have been shortened. The beginning of each chapter had a divider stating the title on the right and a posed-photograph of Lilly on the left, which I felt went too over the top. While this one did not really spoil the reading experience, it did not add to it either. In my opinion, caricatures could have easily done the job. The cons, however, weigh just a small fraction against the pros. It takes away from its flawlessness, but does not mar its brilliancy. This is a book that is sitting elegantly on my shelf, a book that I refer sometimes and often recommend, and a book that is somewhere the guideline of my life (Have values, not hobbies being my favourite).For turning a sceptic into a believer, Lilly, you have done a fabulous job!"}, {"userName": "Deborah Embury", "userReviewDate": "Apr 08, 2017", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/34785059-deborah-embury", "userReview": "\"Bawse\" is such a brilliant, funny, and empowering book!! I have about a zillion little sticky tabs throughout this book highlighting Lilly's words of wisdom and advice. I've been watching her videos for years now and her personality just shines through in her book on conquering life! I wish some of the chapters were longer, but that's partially because I could read her words all day. The 50 chapters connected and built on one another beautifully and were incredibly inspiring to me personally. 10/10, would recommend!! <3"}, {"userName": "Lauren", "userReviewDate": "Apr 05, 2017", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/7079235-lauren", "userReview": "The book itself is beautiful - the bright photos and quotes make for an enjoyable experience. Would have enjoyed seeing more meat in the content from Singh's past. Some good advice, but the 50 chapters are so short (2-4 pages) that it's difficult to get in-depth content."}, {"userName": "Bruna Miranda", "userReviewDate": "Apr 04, 2017", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/7016704-bruna-miranda", "userReview": "AAAAAAAAWWW! <3"}, {"userName": "Kristina", "userReviewDate": "Jul 24, 2017", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/9176531-kristina", "userReview": "I absolutely LOVED it!

But as a booklover, I would like to clarify here that this fact did not cloud my judgement about her book. As I mentioned in my video review as well, this is not an autobiography. I say this because I thought, that maybe this was a book about Lilly's amazing life. Thats the reason I had pre-ordered it. This, instead, is a self help book in which Lilly has imparted her pearls of wisdom regarding what one should do to be successful in life, which I think is pretty great too considering her own success as a youtube sensation is pretty phenomenal. This book has four sections :1) Master Your Mind2) Hustle Harder3) Make Heads Turn4) Be a UnicornEach of these four sections have a number of chapters where Lilly tells us that what we should do in order to achieve these things. At the end of each of these four parts there is an \"Out of the Blue\" section where she has talked about her personal life and how she was once a depressed person and how now she is a happy and positive person.In the beginning itself, it has been mentioned that this book doesn't contain any \"fluffy qoutes\" or any escalators to success but follows an extremely practical approach. And that is exactly how it was in this book.Although I must mention here that despite talking about success in a rational way, this book still did make me very happy and motivated me a great deal.As a youtuber(booktuber) myself, I found this book extra helpful in many ways . Though obviously even if you are not a youtuber, that doesn't mean that you won't find this book useful. Infact, what are you waiting for?
