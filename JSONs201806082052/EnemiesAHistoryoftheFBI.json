The book spends a lot of time discussing the career and legacy of J Edgar Hoover dispelling myths (most evidence discounts the commonly held belief that he was a closeted homosexual) and describing in detail his relentless pursuit of power in his personal fight against Communism which colored most if not all of his tenure. There are some great, timeless quotes which bear relevance today. In 1920, in freeing 13 prisoners held in abysmal conditions on Deer Island having been arrested with highly questionable techniques, Judge George Anderson said, \"A mob is a mob whether made up of government officials acting under instructions from the Department of Justice, or criminals, loafers or the vicious classes.\" (P. 40). The corrupt president Harding and his Attorney General, Harry Dougherty, exemplified many of the same characteristics of our current administration and Hoover thrived in this environment. Alice Roosevelt Longworth: \"Harding was not a bad man. He was just a slob - a slack, good-natured man with an unfortunate disposition to surround himself with intimates of questionable character.\" (P. 53). Sad to note that some things never change. History records the various scandals such as the Teapot Dome bribes of $300,000 taken by the Secretary of the Interior from oil companies among others. Unfortunately, Hoover and the FBI were so obsessed with chasing the \"Reds\" that little was done to stop this and revelations were made after Harding's death in 1923. It was disheartening to read that FDR allowed Hoover to accumulate vast amounts of information on suspected Nazis and Communists obtained via illegal wiretaps and black bag break-ins. Rarely however, was this information able to be used to thwart evil-doers. That being said, the FBI was key in breaking the various Nazi cyphers which did help the war effort. However, a dangerous precedent was set when occasionally the targets were political opponents rather than real dangers to American democracy. In the 50s, Hoover went after homosexuals and Communists (which he lumped into the same category) with a vengeance creating the environment of paranoia exploited for political gains for a short time by the notorious Senator McCarthy. It is unsettling to note that the FBI kept a Sex Deviates Program in operation which destroyed many lived and careers and which really only ended in 2011 when homosexuals were able to openly serve in the US military (p. 176). After Brown vs Board of Education which made segregation of schools illegal, the KKK went on a burning and killing spree which was largely ignored by Hoover who was among other things, a racist himself - Bill Sullivan: \"He hated liberalism, he hated blacks, he hated Jews - he had a this great long list of hates.\" (P. 199) This irrational hatred led Hoover and the FBI to target the entire Civil Rights movement including MLK and others as \"Communist sympathizers\" for which wiretaps were sought and obtained. Weiner does not accuse the FBI of being involved in the big political assassinations of the 60s: JFK, RFK, MLK, etc but he does describe Hoover's antagonism with each of these figures.Naturally, there is also lengthy discussion of Watergate and the 9/11 WTC attack. The latter however is a bit hurried as it is given far less space than the Hoover period. I recall being nearly convinced by some of the 9/11 conspiracy theories that circulated in the aftermath, but see from Weiner's book that facts would tend to discount any collusion whatsoever between Bush and the attacks. It was incompetence and inter-agency rivalry that allowed al Quaeda to perform this horrific dead - and there were multiple warnings that were ignored due to bureaucracy rather than willful ignorance. One can still wonder why Bush allowed the Bin Laden family to leave to Saudi Arabia immediately after the attacks when all other flights were grounded, but this is not discussed and therefore - at least to me - remains mysterious.As for the overall book, it is more of a condemnation of the FBI's overreach than a year-by-year history of the Bureau. I would have liked more information on what they did right in pursuing the mafia in the 30s to 50s for instance and less of the Communist paranoia. Also, I was left with some uncertainty as to the overlapping jurisdictions of the FBI, the Justice Department, the CIA and the NSA - but then perhaps that was Weiner's point: the lack of a charter for the FBI since its founding left room for too much interpretation and this abuse of power over the years. On a positive note, the description of Mueller's tenure gives me confidence that in his current role as a special prosecutor, he is probably the one man that has the integrity to stand up to power in these troubled times.Highly recommended reading in the wake of Comey's firing and the legal battles that will certainly plague DC for the foreseeable future. I can't wait to see Comey's testimony this week..."}, {"userName": "Mara", "userReviewDate": "May 20, 2014", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/1923002-mara", "userReview": "\"A free people must have both security and liberty. They are warring forces, yet we cannot have one without the other.\"\n  \n When William Webster became Director of the Federal Bureau of Investigation in 1978, he was shocked to find that the FBI, spawned from the Bureau of Investigation (BOI) in 1935, was without a legal framework for its activities and operations. Author Tim Weiner describes:\n  \n    \"The Bureau had no charter\u2014a legal birth certificate from Congress spelling out its role. It had never had one. It still does not.\"\n  \n Weiner's \n  \n    Enemies\n  \n is a whirlwind history of how such an entity came to be and how, limited only by the \"president's oath to take care that the laws are faithfully executed,\" its boundaries and missions have stretched and pulled and become what they are today. The author further specifies his goal as honing in on the history of the FBI's secret intelligence operations, describing the book (in part) as \n  \"a record of illegal arrests and detentions, break-ins, burglaries, wiretapping, and bugging on behalf of the president.\"\nMost of what I found lacking in the book lay outside of Weiner\u2019s intended scope. So, I only have myself to blame for the long list of events about which I want to know so much more. In all fairness, those details and anecdotes would have rendered this already hefty book into an unwieldy tome. You can\u2019t have it all, I suppose.American MachiavelliThere's a reason that a good chunk of FBI history reads much like a biography of its famed first director, J. Edgar Hoover. Since I already got most of my Archer-referencing J. Edna Hoover ya-yas out reading \n  The Puppetmaster: The Secret Life of J. Edgar Hoover\n earlier this year, I\u2019m gonna shy away from commenting much on the man himself. However, it's clear that without Hoover, there simply is no history of this breed of federal activity.\n  \n    \"He was a founding father of American intelligence and the architect of the modern surveillance state. Every fingerprint on file, every byte of biographic and biometric data in the computer banks of the government, owes its origins to him.\"\n  \n\n  Got a problem with that? Well, yeah! Duh. In a government that purportedly relies on a system of checks and balances, this kind of power (which, of course, is a function of information) is not meant to be left on the shoulders of one man without some serious supervision. And Hoover had the cunning necessary to keep that consolidated power. If you\u2019re including his years as Director of the BOI, then Hoover\u2019s reign starts with Calvin Coolidge in 1924 and closes during the Nixon Administration in 1972.Legalizing Spycraft\n  The Espionage Act of 1917\n was a game changer such that when Hoover became the chief of the Justice Department\u2019s Radical Division in 1919, anyone in possession of information that could harm the nation (basically, anything with \u201cdisloyal ideas\u201d) could be tossed in the slammer. You had your anarchists, socialists, and, of course, the good old Communist conspiracy, all of which the Justice Department wanted to quash, and thought J. Edgar was the man to do it.To no great surprise, things got out of hand pretty quickly as espionage set its sights on senators at the whim of the attorney general.\n  \u201cThe Bureau of Investigation had been created as an instrument of law. It was turning into an illegal weapon of political warfare.\u201d \n The transition from BOI to FBI in 1935, however, was not inconsequential. Under Franklin D. Roosevelt, a wartime president (in case you forgot about a little thing called WWII), Hoover was first charged with tackling cases that crossed state boundaries- \n  gangster wars, Prohibition\n. You know, stuff that had Hoover holding tommy guns for documentaries like You Can\u2019t Get Away With It (below) in 1936.\n  Those criminal justice elements, and raids on political meetings, private homes, bookstores and bedrooms, however, didn\u2019t give Hoover the kind of wiggle room he felt he needed to compete with the experienced foreign espionage services of the Soviets, Germans or Japanese. Enter, \n  the Smith Act of 1940\n which \"included the toughest federal restrictions on free speech in American history: it outlawed words and thoughts aimed at overthrowing the government, and it made membership in any organization with that intent a federal crime.\"Wartime, Wiretaps and Turf WarsThough Hoover had a hefty load on his plate under FDR, World War II required new arms of intelligence, and Roosevelt appointed \n  William \u201cWild Bill\u201d Donovan\n spymaster for the Office of Secret Services (which was, itself, a secret). Hoover was never big on sharing, and, thus, was not a fan of Wild Bill (considered the \u201cintellectual father\u201d of the CIA).\n  Thus began decades of painfully uncoordinated branches of American secret intelligence. Hoover was ever-aware of the lay of the land, and how best to manipulate higher-ups to get necessary approval. Weiner points out that: \n  \u201cif we don\u2019t do this people will die\u201d\n has withstood the test of time as a one-liner with a record of garnering quick signatures.When the going was good, Hoover was first in line to take the credit. When \n  Nazi saboteurs\n, including \n  George Dasch\n (below) were captured in 1942, Edgar was sure to get a letter to the Oval Office ASAP boasting of how the FBI had effectively stopped the Third Reich from invading American soil (not bothering to mention that Dasch, in fact, turned himself in).\n  And, in a vast oversimplification of affairs, let\u2019s just say that when FDR passed and Truman took office, Hoover tried to treat Truman like a gullible babysitter, claiming FDR totally would have let him watch TV after 9pm, or, you know, run a black bag job or two.From the Red Scare to the War on TerrorI was born in 1984, so names like \n  Timothy McVeigh\n, \n  Ted Kaczynski\n, and \n  David Koresh\n come to mind when I think of FBI takedowns of yesteryear.\n  Then I remember hearing a little something something about some \n  McCarthy\n fellow who dominated the small screen for a while, getting to watch Invasion of the Body Snatchers in high school history class, and Boris and Natasha from Rocky and Bullwinkle, and it comes back to me that the threat of Communism was kind of a big deal.\n  This would be the part of the book where I leaned heavily on Wikipedia to give me a bit more context on a hit parade of names that came up in a mix of Bureau espionage achievements and embarrassments. You know, the type of stuff that would have \n  Ronald Reagan\n joking into the microphone during soundcheck:\n  \n    \u201cMy fellow Americans, I\u2019m pleased to tell you today that I've signed legislation that will outlaw Russia forever.\u201d\n  \n Even as the targets of secret intelligence operations and the faces of terror shifted from the likes of \n  Aldrich Ames\n and \n  Alger Hiss\n, to the \n  Blind Sheik\n (below) and \n  Osama Bin Laden\n, there remained one constant, critical threat to the American way of life.\n  I think FBI Director Robert S. Mueller (from 2001 to 2013) summed it up best:\n\u201cWe did not have a management system in place to assure that we were following the law.\u201d The Rules of EngagementWeiner does get into the detail of how changes in technology and personnel (not to mention geopolitics) altered/continues to alter the elusive balance between security and freedom. He does a pretty damn good job of it too, so, you know, read the book, because it's interesting and intricate stuff.Some rules have become a bit more clear. You know, like the fact that \u201cif invited in, law enforcement can enter your home without a warrant.\u201d (citation, Cyril Figgis). And, once that happens, well I'll let \n  Agent Hawley\n say it:\n  [Oh, come on! Did you really expect me to do this entire review without at least one Archer reference?]"}, {"userName": "Hadrian", "userReviewDate": "Feb 13, 2012", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/4100763-hadrian", "userReview": "An alarming and sobering book, comparable to the same author's study on the CIA.From the 1920s to 1972, the FBI was little more than the personal satrap of J. Edgar Hoover. From the First Red Scare, John Reed and Emma Goldman all the way up to the Vietnam War and the Civil Rights movement - he had almost total control over domestic intelligence. However, the FBI also acted as a foreign analysis and counterintelligence bureau, counteracting or competing with the CIA on multiple occasions.Their record was mixed, at best. Some of their best successes were in World War II - completely destroying the German espionage network in the US for example, but they completely missed Pearl Harbor, despite having broken the Japanese code. Eisenhower was a cooperative ally, trying to get intelligence on the Soviet Union (which was a success). Under the LBJ administration, Hoover was determined to smear Martin Luther King, whereas LBJ wanted to smash the Klan (which they did!) They did, in fact, keep tabs on the sexual liaisons of senior government officials, and Hoover did threaten Kennedy at least once with this information. Nixon was too paranoid even by their standards, demanding information on connections which did not exist. When even they balked at breaking into the Dem's headquarters, he organized the Plumbers and did it himself.Like the CIA, the FBI had its own foreign interventions. In one instance, an FBI informant took power in the Dominican Republic.After Hoover's decline and fall, Nixon's administration fell shortly after, and the organization had nearly destroyed itself before it could be rebuilt again. Some directors were weak, and others were openly disastrous - Louis Freeh, instead of investigating the budding Middle East terror networks like the CIA, refused to speak to Clinton at all and made the now-baffling decision of allying with the Gingrich congress and prosecuting Clinton for perjury.Now that the NDAA and its new indefinite detention provisions have been signed into law some months ago, the organization may yet be stronger than ever. The powers which it had lost in the 1970s with Hoover's passing sprang back with the Patriot Act. It remains to be seen what will be done, and how many other executives are tempted this power, mercurial as it is."}, {"userName": "Jason", "userReviewDate": "May 14, 2012", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/907910-jason", "userReview": "Reading this book i realized a couple things i didn't know before. One, that J. Edgar Hoover was probably the most powerful man in American history, only because of the amount of sway that he had on just about anyone. And two, that the FBI is this weird mix of 1984 and the Wizard of Oz, where you have this agency that is presumably watching you all the time but it does have a head; and that head, until his death, was J. Edgar.I really love the fantastical element of his character. The daunting seriousness coupled with the insatiable lust for being on the top of the mountain, where you oversee everyone else and no one sees you, a very private way of living, behind the screen, Wizard of Oz:Ehrlichman approached the director with caution. His staff had warned him \"that every meeting in Hoover's office was secretly filmed or videotaped. But they did not prepare me for the Wizard of Oz approach that his visitors were required to make.\" From the corridors of Justice, Ehrlichman was ushered through double doors guarded by Hoover's personal attendants. He walked into a room crammed with tributes to Hoover--plaques and citations emblazoned with emblems of American eagles and eternally flaming torches. The anteroom led to a second, more formal room, with hundreds more awards. That led to a third trophy room with a highly polished desk. The desk was empty.\"J. Edgar Hoover was nowhere to be seen,\" he wrote. \"My guide opened a door behind the desk, at the back of the room, and I was ushered into an office about twelve or thirteen feet square, dominated by Hoover himself; he was seated ina large leather desk chair behind a wooden desk in the center of the room. When he stood, it became obvious that he and his desk were on a dais about six inches high. I was invited to sit on a low, purplish leather couch to his right. J. Edgar Hoover looked down on me and began to talk.\"I find this book terrifying. Because in developing the FBI, J. Edgar thrust into our justice system all of the covert shit that haunts us, the lists of radicals or subversives, the secretive tribunals, wiretapping, dossiers of politically important characters and what's worst this sprawl of information contained by, now, the NSA in a neverending database in Bluffington, UT. Talking with Tim Weiner through the Goodreads History club, I found out that Hoover was motivated because, quite simply, he thought Communism was Evil. That's capital E, E-vil. He was in the midst of a holy war for American Freedom against the communist usurper. This book does set up a context for that fear, right as the mad bombers of Luigi Galleani are bombing Chicago's chief of police and Wall Street; i understand that harrowing fear of a world under attack and the extremes you would do in the circumstance.Hoover bought into Communism/Anarchism bent at this young and impressionable moment in his life as the never-ceasing wherewithal that we buy into terrorists having now. Not only a call to end what we know as freedom, but martyrdom for the sake of making sure our way of life is removed for their political ideals.Understanding that, Hoover sought to take them out of the picture. This begat the Palmer Raids which begat the WWII lists of subversives which begat the Security Index and Cointelpro and the CIA's formation. After reading this book, i actually believe that Hoover was the Cold War. Now, you might say, that's crazy. World-wide arms race with all of its soldiers spies. Hoover could not solely be responsible for that entire make-up. No, not exactly. But when we really conceive the beginnings of the Cold War, Roosevelt saying in 1940, that spies, saboteurs and traitors are the actors in this new strategy. With all of these we must and will deal vigorously. And that was Hoover's M.O., \"constant surveillance,\" as Pinkerton wanted. So it began in the name of national security, but i like a quote by Louis Brandeis a Supreme court justice who railed against the authority to allow wiretapping, even in the name of making society suffer and giving criminals greater immunity than has been known heretofore. You always have to question, \"Who is that policing force?\", or as Brandeis put it, the greatest danger to liberty lie in insidious encroachments by men of zeal, well-meaning but without understanding.In the name of securing our freedom, Hoover developed a force of \"intelligence\" that kept everyone in this country in-check. Baggage on JFK and MLK, Adelaide Stephenson and Eleanor Roosevelt. Not to mention student groups, the Black Panther Party, and politicians galore. It's true, there are subversive agents that are trying to respell the ways in which America operates itself. And owing to the Alexander Hamilton's quote, the epitaph of the book, denying them will compel nations the most attached to liberty to resort for repose and security to institutions which have a tendency to destroy their civil and political rights. To be more safe, they at length become willing to run the risk of being freeBut is this worth 10,000 immigrants being arrested in 1920. 31,000 immigrants after World War 2.the infiltration of political groups by spies to inform and possibly work as provocateurs. or possibly the most heinous offense, allowing an information collection agency and clandestine operating force of this massive power to fall into the wrong hands, such as Bush and Cheney or Richard Nixon.This so-called safety has long term implications.

The converse also applies; Weiner retains the fast-paced, journalistic style of Legacy - tantalising links are left hanging and background is left as exercise for the reader.Like his biography of the Agency this effort starts to fade as it heads closer to the present, deprived of declassified documents and on-the-record testimony it starts to read as a recap of recent NYT/WaPo exposes and the insights become less and less penetrating - one wonders whether Weiner's glowing assessment of Mueller's FBI will look anywhere near as convincing in twenty years time.Regardless, Enemies does a great job of placing the FBI, largely thought of as a law-enforcement organisation firmly under the spotlight in its capacity as the United States' domestic intelligence service, exploring and exposing it's successes, failures and the inherent tensions of running a secret police force in a democracy."}, {"userName": "David", "userReviewDate": "Mar 08, 2012", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/8107647-david", "userReview": "Dryly factual.

The writing style would certainly make me hesitant to read three times the pages.This book should be read by all Americans despite the intelligence-report style of writing. This is an honest and seemingly unbiased account of the many failures and few triumphs of the FBI in the areas of counterintelligence and terrorism.

This book focuses on the FBI's role in terrorist activity prevention and investigation so I hope that the history of the FBI with regard to good old crime is better. Some info that I didn't know: The FBI for most of its existence didn't even have a viable information system to retrieve all the information it obtained, legally and otherwise. We heard a lot about how the non-cooperation and non-communication between the various intelligence services aided and abetted the events of 9/11. The author shows that this divided intelligence function had its roots in FDR's initial pre-WWII decision to divide the function among the FBI, Army and Navy . What is more amazing is all the long-time Soviet spies who functioned within the intelligence services for years without detection. Weiner has 84 pages of source footnotes to back up his facts.

Being that J. Edgar Hoover was synonymous with the FBI, I'm not surprised to find that so far it is basically about the man who singlehandedly built the FBI to what it is today. Even knowing what I did about how Hoover used, and abused his powers to fight communism, I have still been shocked at how far he actually went to increase and retain the power that he welded. And how single-minded he was in his pursuit. He seemed to think that everything was linked to communism, from homosexuality to the civil rights movement. I'm very much pulled back to the book every time I set it down. I can't wait to find out what he's going to do next. I'm approaching the Kennedy years so I'll finish this review when I'm done. Gotta find out how he got along with the Kennedy brothers.Final ReviewAs I expected, Hoover didn't get along with the Kennedy's too keenly. The post-Hoover FBI didn't fair well either as subsequent directors failed to command the fear that Hoover did.Enemies is a fast paced read that will keep you turning pages.

The FBI is an institution cloaked in secrecy and mystique, not all good, in the eyes of many Americans. What is great about how this author writes and approaches his subject is to dig deep into the details, line them up so that the facts tell the story all while drawing together disparate parts and weaving together relevant pieces to lay the story all out there. Victories to missed opportunities, he leaves nothing out. He gives detail and analysis without imposing too much of his own judgement, and keeps the story line moving.The content sometimes scared the hell out of me, frankly. The tactics instituted by J. Edgar Hoover of secret wiretapping and mass imprisonment went too far. Perhaps that is too easy to say in hindsight, but the reality is that Hoover was convinced that the communist threat (to the extent there was one) was behind the civil rights movement and therefore justified wiretapping of civil rights leaders and their lawyers and others around them including hotel rooms they used when traveling. To find what? Nothing, as it turns out. At some point it seemed like the fact they were finding nothing spurned them on to look even harder. It was not a good foundation for an agency that is entrusted with keeping the country safe. Secrecy was ingrained in the FBI for decades. Hoover kept secret files that no one knew about until after his death, not even within the agency. At the same time you have to admire Hoover's tenacity in how he wielded power and influence with all the different President's under which he served. They didn't all like him, and I don't think he cared too much about that, as long as he could get what he felt he needed to do the job he believed he was charged to do. By the end of the book I was not in complete shock and despair. Things get better - they get worse for awhile, but they get better by the time we get around to the present day FBI. I have a great deal of repsect for what the women and men of the FBI are tasked with, and like any job there are good and bad among the bunch. It is clear to me that the leader of the organization plays a critical role and has the hardest job of all, to pursue a vision that keeps our country safe in a way that protects civil liberties and follows the rule of law.

The FBI began it's life as the president's secret police force, then it branched into counter-intelligence during World War I. The scope of J. Edgar Hoover's power, and his willingness to abuse it, intimidated a string of presidents and attorneys general.Hoover dies considerably after the half-way point in the book (to give you some sense of his influence). Then Mr. Weiner chronicles the Watergate scandals, double agents during the Cold War, conflict with the CIA, decades of weak leadership, and counterterrorism in the modern age.The book was interesting on the whole, but the second quarter, deep into the J. Edgar Hoover (as opposed to Herbert Hoover) era, it became difficult for me to keep my attention focused on who Hoover was targeting, blackmailing and bugging. But even that reinforces one of the themes of the book--the FBI has done a lot of stuff that no one is happy about. Though it has solved a great deal of crime along the way. The tension of freedom versus security is clear throughout.Interestingly, Mr. Weiner (who has also written a similar book, which I have not read, on the history of the CIA) portrays the FBI as highly ethical and on the moral high ground compared to the CIA on the treatment of terror suspects in the last two decades.3.5 stars--rounded down to three stars because of that really slow part in the middle that I had a hard time getting through.

A tale of utter incompetence, constant leaks, constitutional infringements, blackmail, political infighting and abuses, miscommunication, petty jealousies, and questionable successes. On the bright side, also a tale of many dedicated men and women working against inertia, confusion, and absurdly outdated technology, who apparently never condoned or engaged in the modern torture and humiliation tactics of the CIA and Army.The one negative of the book is that the endnotes aren't referenced in the text; highly annoying and not acceptable for a work of history. That's the only reason I don't give the book 5 stars. Even so, I'd recommend it to anyone who thinks it might interest them; I enjoyed it so much I'm looking forward to reading Weiner's past work."}, {"userName": "Shaun", "userReviewDate": "Aug 28, 2013", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/9821704-shaun", "userReview": "This book is not as much a comprehensive review on the history of the FBI as the title might suggest. It's more of a biography of J. Edgar Hoover and his interactions with the Presidents and the Attorneys General of his time with an elongated addendum of what happened after he died. This makes sense considering the book was created after a declassification of quite a bit of confidential documents made during Hoover's time. It's still an interesting read nonetheless, especially if you are interested in the behind-the-scenes politicking at the highest levels. Reader beware, though, as with all politics, it's a pretty ugly sight seeing how things really get done."}, {"userName": "Nicholas", "userReviewDate": "Apr 25, 2018", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/1072527-nicholas", "userReview": "Current events have peaked my interest in everything from Watergate to the history of the FBI. I'd seen Weiner's Enemies cited by a number of media outlets as a definitive modern history of the institution, so I was excited to jump right in and see what history tells us about the FBI's current role in partisan squabbling. I have to admit, I was a bit surprised by a lot of what I found and simultaneously disheartened and assured by our present situation given some more historical context.The book can be divided into two major parts \u2013The Hoover Era and Everything After the Hoover Era \u2013 that follow a single theme centered around the Fourth Amendment as its sanctity is alternately violated or fetishized depending on the way the political winds were blowing and whether or not Americans felt afraid enough to tolerate violations of their civil liberties. The short of it is, according to Weiner, the FBI has mostly not been a faithful steward of our rights and has regularly relied on extraconstitutional methods to obtain evidence or to persecute individuals the bureau believed were dangers to American political and social stability. They often behaved in this way at the explicit direction of presidents of both parties.For a long time, the arbiter of what preserved America and made her safe was one man: J. Edgar Hoover. The first half of the book reads almost like a biography. It should. Hoover fought for the creation of the FBI and then ruled over it like a feudal lord using its resources to protect his interests and advance the interests of various presidential or congressional patrons from FDR to McCarthy and Nixon. He served presidents of both parties with equal faith and what bought his loyalty more than political ideology were promises of independence and funding for his beloved Bureau. The more power and independence promised and delivered, the more Hoover tried to fulfill the wishes of that president. What was most remarkable to me about this era of the Bureau was the ambiguity of its mission. Born in 1980, I've always associated the FBI with law enforcement. That's not the way Hoover originally envisioned its mandate, however. In his mind, the FBI was an intelligence agency, focusing at times on finding and eliminating terrorist or espionage threats from Communists to Nationalists (and the occasional Civil Rights organizer). He was loathe to pursue the mob and white collar crime barely seemed to register to him. He viewed the CIA as a competitor and regularly sought to undermine it and supplant it with the FBI. In the meantime he approved thousands of black bag jobs, warrantless wiretaps, and authorized the collecting and storing of useful information about political rivals for the future. After Hoover, the FBI struggled to regain its reputation, stature, and a clear sense of purpose. To this day Congress hasn't fully defined in legislation the legal mandate of the Bureau. After Watergate and a string of other controversies (including the revelation of the COINTELPRO program), a string of directors struggled to change the culture at the agency and set it on a legal footing that didn't involve presidential authorizations to engage in extraconstitutional behavior. It wasn't until the tenure of Robert Mueller that it seems to have found that footing. As Weiner recounts, Mueller set up over the course of his tenure a legal framework where the FBI could seek and get classified wiretaps against hostile powers through normal (judicial) legal channels. The culture of the agency changed. Where once it was common to engage in breaking and entering, the FBI found itself in a position to bear witness to and reveal to the rest of America abuses in detention and interrogation that became common at black sites throughout the Iraq War and the War on Terror. It was FBI agents who reported abuses at places like Abu Ghraib and Guantanamo and the agency finally seems to have very recently discovered a backbone when it comes to protecting and defending the constitutional rights of citizens. Well...I guess that last bit depends on who you're asking these days, but clearly its behavior is far more constrained than it was in Hoover's day. Overall this was a phenomenal work of history that relied on thousands of documents and interviews. Weiner spins an excellent narrative for an agency that has a hundred year history in everything from counterintelligence to mob-busting. The success he has lies in his discipline. Weiner always finds a way to turn the events he's narrating back to the central theme of privacy and the fourth amendment's protections as a way of grounding the story and preventing it from straying too far afield. A very helpful piece for those perplexed about the Bureau's sudden intrusion into our politics. It's not really that new. What's new is that we're actually hearing about it."}, {"userName": "Bill Shannon", "userReviewDate": "May 22, 2017", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/12059139-bill-shannon", "userReview": "J. Edgar Hoover is the main character in this book, at least for the first 2/3rds, and if there was ever any question that Hoover is one of the most consequential people in American history, that question no longer exists in my mind. But the Hoover of the book surprised me: my mind's eye had always pictured Hoover as a Machiavellian, power-hungry manipulator: the Master of Whispers of the American government. But the Hoover I read about is less a scheming Edward G. Robinson type, and more of a dedicated patriot. I have no doubt in my mind that Hoover loved this country, even if he also loved the accolades, power and influence that came with his station as head of the Federal Bureau of Investigation. The fact that Hoover was America's top cop from the FDR Administration through Nixon(!) is almost unfathomable. But he wasn't kept in that position because of any dirty secrets he held over the power brokers -- or at least not that the book reveals. He was simply the best person for the job for the better part of four decades. He was a tactical genius, and yes, he did skirt around certain legal obstacles, but from what I can tell, he did it out of a true love of country.Within the story of Hoover and the shadow he casts over the Bureau nearly half a century later, is a chronicle of all the growing pains and traumatic events in American history. From the Red Scares (1910s and 1950s), to essentially destroying the Klan in the 1950s and '60s, to the COINTELPRO of the the last decade of Hoover's life. The latter -- when the FBI started spying on American citizens for fear of subversion -- is kind of the turning point of the FBI, when it became less about defending America and more about spying and tapping the phones of people who aren't necessarily breaking the law, but have dangerous ideas. After Hoover's death in 1972, the Bureau went through a few years of triumph -- finding the evidence for Watergate -- and about two decades of relative incompetence. When Bill Clinton shit-canned Director William Sessions in '93, nobody protested because he was patently awful. Although Louis Freeh wasn't much better.One of the more interesting chapters in the Bureau's history is the final chapters of the book, which detail the course correction of the Bureau, moving away from warrantless wiretaps and waterboarding to using (gasp!) the law to take down terrorists. I'd be curious to see if they put in any kind of addendum later on to include the Comey firing.If you have a fancy for American political history of the 20th century, you'd be hard pressed to find a more interesting and fact-filled book."}, {"userName": "Antonio Nunez", "userReviewDate": "Jan 04, 2018", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/22126697-antonio-nunez", "userReview": "Wiener\u2019s FBI book is very good. It is divided into two halves. After a brief prelude of a decade in which the bureau mostly chased anarchists and implemented the Red Scare, the story hits its stride when J Edgar Hoover was appointed director in 1924, a post he would vacate only upon his death in 1972. Hoover remade the Bureau in his own image: an image of honesty, patriotism and professionalism over a reality of dissimulation, paranoia and the trampling of civil liberties. Hoover worked well with the most political presidents, such as FDR, LBJ and Nixon. He fought viciously with other such as Truman and Kennedy. To these he was disloyal and he worked to undermine them and their policies. His extreme nastiness was often evident, never more than when he took great pleasure in informing his nominal boss Bobby Kennedy of the murder in Dallas of his brother, JFK. Hoover\u2019s focus was in fighting local communists. He never believed the mafia to be a danger and never pursued organized crime seriously. But even Hoover with his warrantless searches, bugs and wire taps did not go far enough for Nixon. Post Nixon and post Hoover the Bureau had great difficulty in finding its role. Its leadership was often lackluster, at least until Robert Muller, who managed to give it a moral center in the post-9-11 era. Over its existence the FBI has often failed in its mission and has fallen prey to bureaucratic infighting and compartmentalization. Other times it has enjoyed great successes.This is a good history of the bureau, told at the right level of detail."}, {"userName": "Beth", "userReviewDate": "Sep 05, 2017", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/36905361-beth", "userReview": "This took me a while to read because it was a bit dry in spots, and I took some time this summer to slow down on my book reading (my news reading was at an all-time high, though!).

Mr. Weiner is a Pulitzer Prize win\u00adning author and a for\u00admer New York Times reporter who wrote largely about Amer\u00adi\u00adcan secu\u00adrity.The book is divided into four parts: Spies and Sabo\u00adteurs, World War, Cold War and War on Ter\u00adror. Each part spot\u00adlights on the main focus of the FBI dur\u00ading those times from Com\u00admu\u00adnism, to spies to polit\u00adi\u00adcal espi\u00adonage and terrorism.Ene\u00admies: A His\u00adtory of the FBI by Tim Weiner is a fas\u00adci\u00adnat\u00ading book and an excel\u00adlent treat\u00adment of what basi\u00adcally amounts to domes\u00adtic spy\u00ading. In his research, Mr. Weiner invoked the words of the Found\u00ading Fathers that we must be vig\u00adi\u00adlant; buy not com\u00adpro\u00admise our civil lib\u00ader\u00adties in the process. In this treat\u00adment, with each Pres\u00adi\u00addent of either major party, this com\u00adpro\u00admise is con\u00adstantly tested with J. Edgar Hoover play\u00ading a major role.The por\u00adtraits of men in power are one of the most dis\u00adturb\u00ading aspects in this book. Nixon, Rea\u00adgan, Clin\u00adton, LBJ, Hoover and more are all com\u00adplex peo\u00adple who, once in the seat of power, dis\u00admiss their for\u00admer beliefs in the notion that they are above the law (Nixon stated that if a Pres\u00adi\u00addent does \u201csome\u00adthing\u201d it\u2019s not ille\u00adgal and every other Pres\u00adi\u00addent has agreed with him so far). Even Obama, a Con\u00adsti\u00adtu\u00adtional scholar, signed the National Defense Autho\u00adriza\u00adtion Act, which allows for unspec\u00adi\u00adfied mil\u00adi\u00adtary impris\u00adon\u00adment, with\u00adout trial, of any Amer\u00adi\u00adcan cit\u00adi\u00adzen \u201cwho was a part of or sub\u00adstan\u00adtially sup\u00adported Al Qaeda, the Tal\u00adiban or asso\u00adci\u00adated forces that are engaged in hos\u00adtil\u00adi\u00adties against the United States or its coali\u00adtion part\u00adners\u201d. Obama did pledge that he would not use this power, but what about the next guy (or gal)?Hoover is so blinded by his hatred of Com\u00admu\u00adnists that he jus\u00adti\u00adfies all his uncon\u00adsti\u00adtu\u00adtional acts (throw\u00ading Amer\u00adi\u00adcans in jail, spy\u00ading, etc.) by that logic. Even the Civil Rights move\u00adment was a tar\u00adget, not because Hoover was racist, but because he believed the Com\u00admu\u00adnist Party was behind it. But Hoover wouldn\u2019t do any\u00adthing to embar\u00adrass the Bureau (which allows for a lot).Being an orga\u00adni\u00adza\u00adtion with no for\u00admal char\u00adter from Con\u00adgress, an orga\u00adni\u00adza\u00adtion which its basic fund\u00ading is still some\u00adwhat secret since the days Theodore Roo\u00adsevelt cre\u00adated a \u201cBureau of Inves\u00adti\u00adga\u00adtion\u201d con\u00adtrary to the wishes of Con\u00adgress the FBI had much to prove. Being secre\u00adtive is no recipe for suc\u00adcess as the reader finds out; con\u00adcen\u00adtrat\u00ading on secret intel\u00adli\u00adgence oper\u00ada\u00adtions, the author tells of many fail\u00adures and tales of stun\u00adning incom\u00adpe\u00adtence which occurred despite the secrecy, law\u00adless\u00adness and pow\u00ader\u00adful friends in high places.But Ene\u00admies is not an all out crit\u00adi\u00adcism of the FBI, Mr. Weiner does con\u00adtrast how the FBI has changed under Direc\u00adtor Robert Mueller who believed in doing the right thing and even offer to resign (with other senior mem\u00adbers) if the Bush 43 admin\u00adis\u00adtra\u00adtion wouldn\u2019t stop ille\u00adgal domes\u00adtic spy\u00ading after 9/11. The admin\u00adis\u00adtra\u00adtion stopped and Mueller has set the tone for the FBI.An eye open\u00ading account of the state of infor\u00adma\u00adtion tech\u00adnol\u00adogy (IT) state of the FBI was a shock. Unlike what movies and TV has us believe, up until recently the FBI\u2019s IT depart\u00adment was sorely lack\u00ading. Agents didn\u2019t have email, couldn\u2019t con\u00adtact agents in other offices or share infor\u00adma\u00adtion. That is one issue which the FBI strug\u00adgled with since day one \u2013 lots of data but lit\u00adtle infor\u00adma\u00adtion. An FBI agent \u201ccould not per\u00adform a Google search or send e-mails out\u00adside their offices\u201d \u2014 not in 1980, but in 2000!Another aspect of the book which was dif\u00adfi\u00adcult to com\u00adpre\u00adhend was the lack of co\u00f6per\u00ada\u00adtion with other intel\u00adli\u00adgence ser\u00advices and some\u00adtimes within the Bureau itself. It was dis\u00adheart\u00adening to read how past direc\u00adtors have mis\u00adjudged their mis\u00adsion, mak\u00ading the White House their main enemy while the agents inves\u00adti\u00adgat\u00ading Al Qaeda mis\u00adin\u00adter\u00adpreted a direc\u00adtive from the Depart\u00adment of Jus\u00adtice to share evi\u00addence. An agent try\u00ading to get a search war\u00adrant for Zacarias Mous\u00adsaoui, the 20th hijacker, didn\u2019t receive it because the FBI appar\u00adently \u201cdid not have a dog in this fight\u201d.That was on the after\u00adnoon of 10 Sep\u00adtem\u00adber, 2001.Ene\u00admies is an immensely inter\u00adest\u00ading read, depress\u00ading at times but with all the mak\u00adings of a first rate thriller. At times I had to put the book down because it is so full of infor\u00adma\u00adtion and at times because it was sim\u00adply too hard to believe what I was read\u00ading. I always respected the work the FBI does and this book just height\u00adened my admi\u00adra\u00adtion to the agents and the lead\u00ader\u00adship which is tak\u00ading them in a new, more con\u00adsti\u00adtu\u00adtional, direction.Dis\u00adclaimer: I got this book for freeFor more reviews and bookish posts please visit: http://www.ManOfLaBook.com"}, {"userName": "Max", "userReviewDate": "Apr 14, 2014", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/8079403-max", "userReview": "Why is it so hard for the United States to have an effective intelligence service and achieve a reasonable balance between individual rights and national security? Weiner\u2019s history of the FBI had me asking that question and the likely answers were not comforting. Ever since 1917 when the Red Threat arose and J. Edgar Hoover joined what would become the FBI, abuse of power and confusion have been the hallmarks of the FBI. Hoover\u2019s need to keep tight personal control meant the FBI was never properly organized. His legacy haunts it to this day.Hoover, as bad as he was with his private collection of secrets on everyone of importance, knew his limits and not to go beyond them, which is why he lasted in the FBI 55 years. Worse than Hoover were presidents such as JFK, Nixon, Reagan and Bush 43, who tried to do the FBI\u2019s job themselves, but didn\u2019t know their limits and went out of control. Weiner\u2019s recounting of the presidents\u2019 relations with the FBI and their attempts to bypass or usurp it were more interesting to me than those of the FBI itself and more upsetting. Here are some highlights. Many presidents were happy to take advantage of Hoover\u2019s secrets. FDR, LBJ and Nixon used information from Hoover\u2019s secret files for their own political purposes. Truman was skeptical of Hoover but would not dare take him on. JFK had plenty of reasons to be terrified of Hoover who had the dirt on his many affairs including the one with Judith Campbell who JFK shared with mob boss Sam Giancana. The JFK administration tried to enlist the mob to assassinate Castro for the CIA with Campbell serving as a go-between with benefits. JFK literally in bed with the mob had to be a new low, but Nixon\u2019s Plumbers, a bumbling crew of Watergate fame led by the inept G. Gordon Liddy, were scraping the bottom too. Reagan, not to be outdone, established his own White House anti-terrorist group under the nefarious Oliver North, hitting bottom with active support of murderous regimes in El Salvador and Nicaragua financed by skimming money from the sale of missiles to Iran, an example of duplicity hard to beat. But then came George W. Bush descending to new lows with lots of advice from one who always knew best, Dick Cheney. Bush and Cheney implemented torture on a wide scale, sending people at will to secret prisons, and abandoning any pretense of individual rights. The proclivity to secrecy and control for personal and ideological gain at the expense of individual rights seems so pervasive that it is hard to believe it will ever change.Weiner ends on a bit of an upbeat note as Obama takes office with Director Mueller as FBI Director and the FBI, CIA and Defense Department agencies finally begin to cooperate. Mueller and his assistant and current FBI Director James Comey were notable for standing up to the Bush administration refusing their demands for wiretaps without warrants. Mueller began rebuilding the FBI following twenty years of incompetent leadership by FBI Directors, Louis Freeh and William Sessions, both having furthered the FBI\u2019s decline. While overall intelligence effectiveness SEEMS to have improved now due to better organization and coordination of intelligence agencies, only time will tell if this is true. History still has to decide if the latest twist on counterterrorism operations, the drone strike program, has more downside than upside. While many terrorists are killed, so are innocent people and many new enemies are created as people turn against the US in what they see as abuse of power. The final answer may lie in how well the program is controlled and history does not bode well here. Would Reagan have used drones in Central America in his support of ruthless dictators or Cheney with Bush\u2019s ever ready approval against the Lackawanna Six in New York simply because HE thought they were an al-Qaeda cell, later disproven? Cheney wanted the US Army to capture the Lackawanna Six, American citizens on American soil, so they could be treated as enemy combatants, sent to Guantanamo, tortured and denied a trial, which except for the intervention of FBI Director Mueller, might well have happened. For Cheney, drones would have provided a much more expedient solution. So what does the future hold for ever present paranoid politicians equipped with ever increasing technical capabilities? We can only guess, but if you are scared, well, history says you should be."}, {"userName": "Maitrey", "userReviewDate": "Jul 29, 2014", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/14247078-maitrey", "userReview": "I rarely read American history. I've to confess, I like more of Ancient and Medieval history which rules American history out, but who doesn't like spies and the cloak and dagger world of espionage eh? Enemies is a history of 20th Century America I could say. I only knew the FBI as an elite law enforcement agency, but Enemies really opened my eyes to a wholly different FBI.Tim Weiner is a New York Times journalist whose previous book is a Pulitzer Prize winning history of the CIA (and next on my list!). Enemies is written in a droll, sometimes witty fashion that keeps you gripped from page one.Weiner recounts that the FBI has spent most of its century long career as the secret police for American Presidents. From the 1920s onwards, the FBI was tasked with handling and removing subversives, foreign spies and communists (to Hoover, they probably were all the same). And boy do J. Edgar Hoover and the FBI make it a mission for Armageddon. Other enemies came and went: anarchists, Nazis, Fascists, Latin American terrorists, homosexuals, Vietnam war dissenters, even civil rights activists; but Hoover was relentless. Weiner stresses that this is finally not a biography of Hoover, but till almost the end of the book, Hoover and the FBI are inseparable. There's more to Hoover than the cross-dressing, living-with-his-mother persona we all know thanks to Hollywood. Then of course, there's Watergate and 9/11. Like I said, it was a good history of America in the 20th Century.At its heart, Enemies is a sobering account of the mixed record of the FBI. They had some real breakthroughs, especially in WWII when they cracked Japanese ciphers (they missed Pearl Harbour though), and destroyed the Nazi spy network in the US; they even had a mole in the highest networks of the Soviet politburo. But they have a terrible record otherwise in the Cold War, and other foreign policy related issues. Hoover also ran a criminal regime with warrant less wiretaps, burglaries and other black-bag jobs whenever it suited him. His defense to other Presidents was that FDR had granted these to him in perpetuity (I kid you not) and every time he had to testify to Congress, he would disconnect all wiretaps a week before and truthfully say the FBI wasn't running any. What was the most shocking aspect was that while Congress and the American public would have taken Hoover to the cleaners if these details were known then, but Bush Jr. and co. have actually legalized these and countless other rights-violations over their sham War on Terror in the 21st Century.Enemies is excellently footnoted and Weiner's research is impeccable. I can't imagine the amount of time he must have spent trawling through declassified and official accounts and documents to find some nuggets hidden underneath. The style with which Weiner presents all this dry information is just superb, and at times you forget you are reading a history. Since he is depending quite a bit on declassified material, Enemies is top-heavy with most of the best bits occurring from the 1920s to 70s. You really get a fresh look at characters such as FDR, Truman, Lyndon Johnson and of course Hoover.I'd happily recommend this book to anybody remotely interested in history, and this book I think is now all the more significant in the light of Snowden's revelations."}, {"userName": "Sam Bruskin", "userReviewDate": "Jun 03, 2012", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/3122769-sam-bruskin", "userReview": "This thing blazes along, (the Fire I smelt smoldering in the Smoke of Leo daCappo's JEH {or is it smoke that smolders?}); even more furiously than TW's CIA Legacy.

The chronology of the bureau from conception through to the war on terror is eye opening in scope and reach, as well as fascinating in detail. The are many reference from the past that would shake a reader in 2017 with its uncanny resemblance to our current trials and crisis.

Based on a wealth of research, declassified documents and interviews, the book devotes many of its pages to the larger-than-life character of its first director, J. Edgar Hoover, who for half a century personified the FBI and left an indelible stamp on the agency housed in the Hoover Building in Washington, D.C. I was compelled to read this book after watching a biopic on Hoover in order to get a fuller picture of the legendary man. The book offers an in-depth, no-holds-barred look at the Bureau and its leadership from Hoover to its most recent director, James B. Comey. Effusive in his praise and sharp in his criticism, the author paints a picture of a government agency torn between balancing its mission to provide security and fight criminal and terrorist activity and the need to protect civil liberties so that \u201cAmericans could be both safe and free.\u201d Its first century has been one of successes, failures, and a constant struggle to find or upset this balance. The author draws from a wealth of documentary evidence to portray a Bureau that in many ways operates like a tragicomedy as it tries to make sense of and respond to ever-changing threats, often in heavy-handed and arguably unconstitutional ways. Weiner does an apt job of bringing the FBI to life. Although the author makes no attempt to tell an impartial story, his interpretation of history makes it all the more interesting. Putting the FBI through the lens of constitutionality and civil rights, he chides the Bureau for its many deficiencies but commends it where it has taken strides to improve, such as discontinuing (at least publicly) warrantless searches and seizures and improving its information systems. He leaves the reader with the impression that the organization has moved away from many mistakes of the past and has a promising future as the U.S. Government\u2019s primary law enforcement agency. The book\u2019s Achilles heel is its over-reliance on archival information. Much of it is devoted to the Hoover years, while events after his death seem glossed over. Depictions of evolution of the FBI during the War on Terror seem rushed. The author felt it necessary to tell the Bureau\u2019s full history, but his lack of source material and apparent lack of access in the post-Hoover period is evident. It might have been better to focus on the agency\u2019s first 50 years and save the last half century for another book.I give this book five (5) stars and highly recommend it to anyone interested in the FBI, federal law enforcement, and civil liberties."}], "description": "Enemies is the first definitive history of the FBI\u2019s secret intelligence operations, from an author whose work on the Pentagon and the CIA won him the Pulitzer Prize and the National Book Award. \u00a0 We think of the FBI as America\u2019s police force. But secret intelligence is the Bureau\u2019s first and foremost mission. Enemies is the story of how presidents have used the FBI as the most formidable intelligence force in American history. \u00a0 Here is the hidden history of America\u2019s hundred-year war on terror. The FBI has fought against terrorists, spies, anyone it deemed subversive\u2014and sometimes American presidents. The FBI\u2019s secret intelligence and surveillance techniques have created a tug-of-war between protecting national security and infringing upon civil liberties. It is a tension that strains the very fabric of a free republic.From the Hardcover edition.", "title": "Enemies: A History of the FBI", "url": "http://www.goodreads.com/book/show/18880380-enemies", "average": 3.89, "cover": "https://images.gr-assets.com/books/1385081392l/18880380.jpg", "reviews": 362, "authors": [{"url": "https://www.goodreads.com/author/show/159090.Tim_Weiner", "name": "Tim Weiner"}], "type": ["History", "Nonfiction", "Politics", "Spy Thriller", "Mystery"], "outlinks": ["http://www.goodreads.com/book/show/970488.Legacy_of_Ashes", "http://www.goodreads.com/book/show/25440225-one-man-against-the-world", "http://www.goodreads.com/book/show/273058.Betrayal", "http://www.goodreads.com/book/show/1228275.Blank_Check"]}
