I did already have a copy in my school library as well. Haunting and impeccably written for a middle grade audience, THE LAST CHERRY BLOSSOM is a required purchase for middle grade libraries and classrooms. This story follows 12-year-old Yuriko and her family in the time period surrounding and including the August 6, 1945 bombing of Hiroshima at the end of Word War II. In addition to the storyline involving the war and bombing, Burkinshaw has included storylines involving friends and family secrets that provide richness and entertainment. Burkinshaw draws on the true experiences of her mother's experiences as a child in Hiroshima for this book, making it an even more unique and compelling story for young and adult readers alike. Included in the back pages are an afterword that explains the genesis of the book, as well as a glossary of the Japanese terms used throughout the story and a list of statistics about Hiroshima. THE LAST CHERRY BLOSSOM would be an amazing middle grade read aloud, and has possibilities for countless lessons surrounding the topics in the book. Just one example of this is propaganda -included as chapter headings in the book are headlines from news stories and propaganda posters being used in the city during this time period - this information is also woven within the book and provides excellent backstory to the political situation in Japan during this time period. Burkinshaw also has a discussion guide for the book that can be requested on her website (http://kathleenburkinshaw.com/student...) and provides Skype visits to classes reading the book. I can not recommend this book highly enough - Yuriko and her family will linger with readers as evidence of the impact of the horrific atomic bombing of Hiroshima, and the true nature of the devastation on residents of the city and surrounding areas."}, {"userName": "Megalion", "userReviewDate": "Apr 24, 2016", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/14853675-megalion", "userReview": "A haunting tale for children about the bombing of Hiroshima. One that was put into writing in novel form by the author at the urging of all the teachers whose classrooms she visited to share her mother's story. The book is adapted from Kathleen's mother's life as a young girl living in Hiroshima. More than half of the book brings into her daily life. We become a 9 yr old girl with a family and friend and daily trials and pleasant things. Best of all, she has a devoted Papa who calls her Joya. World War II is raging but they are removed from it as the battlefields are thousands and thousands of miles away. Yet they must tighten their belts and ration and contribute as much as they can to the war efforts. Even to the point of sending children to work in the war factories. An excellent book for all ages.

These sorts of harrowing contrasts continue throughout the story, growing only more powerful as Kathleen Burkinshaw immerses us in the world of a 12-year old girl trying to live her life in Hiroshima during World War II, the year before the atomic bomb was dropped. Complicated family drama gets interrupted by terrifying radio announcements. An adorable conversation about a secret crush takes place during his somber going away party to join the army. A joyful spring festival has to be celebrated with the underlying fear that an enemy invasion might make it the last. Universal day-in-the-life scenes and Japanese traditions are woven together in this civilian wartime story, providing a seamless introduction to the culture and a world that is heartbreakingly stripped away by war. It\u2019s rather daunting to start The Last Cherry Blossom knowing what\u2019s inevitably coming, especially when it\u2019s so easy to fall in love with Yuriko, her Papa, her best friend Machiko and all the other wonderful characters that pass through her life. But Burkinshaw\u2019s story, loosely based on her mother\u2019s real life experience in Hiroshima, finds a touching balance between the horrors and tragedies of the bomb and the hope that still grows in spite of it. Yuriko is achingly real, sometimes brave, sometimes vulnerable, making tough choices and mistakes alike. There are vivid moments, especially in that perfect last chapter, that I know will stay with me for a very long time. And when most of us learn about Hiroshima in the context of dates, casualty numbers and distant mushroom cloud pictures, having this perspective, this narrative and these inspiring moments is absolutely essential."}, {"userName": "Wendy MacKnight", "userReviewDate": "Aug 19, 2016", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/21824552-wendy-macknight", "userReview": "What a beautiful book. When I began reading The Last Cherry Blossom, I wondered if I would feel a compulsion to read ahead to the event (the bombing of Hiroshima), as if that might be THE centerpiece of the book, but I was wrong. Instead, I found myself completely captivated by the central character, Yuriko, and her family and friends in the dying days of the war in Japan. Burkinshaw wisely begins the story well in advance of the destruction and vividly paints a world of honour, secrets, and the frustration of doing the right thing. As the world around her unravels, so, too, does Yuriko's sense of her place in the world. They are marvelous parallels, and the author never insults the reader by making things easy or simple for the main character or us. As the tock clicks down, Burkinshaw has upped the emotional ante to such an extent that we cannot stop reading, so worried are we about the fates of these individuals. This book deserves a place in our schools as a companion piece to Lois Sepahban's Paper Wishes, telling the two sides of the story from a child's perspective. A beautifully written, special book, the fact that this is based on the author's mother's story makes it all the more touching.

And by now, most readers are familiar with the story of Sadako and the Thousand Paper Cranes by Eleanor Coerr. Sadako's compelling story focuses on her illness 9 years after being exposed to the deadly radiation that resulted in the aftermath of the atomic bomb that was dropped on Hiroshima. However, we don't really learn much about what Japan was like during the war, before the atomic bomb destroyed two cities and some many lives. Until now.The Last Cherry Blossom is the fictionalized story based on the experiences of the author's mother living in Hiroshima as a child during the war. Despite the fact that Japan has been at war with the United States since the bombing of Pearl Harbor in 1941, life hasn't been too difficult for 12-year-old Yuriko Ishikawa, affectionately called Joya by her beloved papa. She is proud of her samurai heritage, and loves to hear papa tell stories about it. But, when her teacher tells her that she has made a mistake on her koseki or family tree project, Yuriko becomes quite upset, asking papa what she meant. Instead of an answer, he has the teacher fired. But why?Despite that, living on the outskirts of Hiroshima, with papa, owner of a newspaper, and her annoying Aunt Kimiko and five-year-old cousin Genji, the family hasn't suffered many of the usual hardships of war - rationing and making do just don't seem to be in evidence. Of course, there are air raids, American planes flying overhead, and Yuriko, her best friend Machiko, in fact, all school children are expected to learn how to fight using a bamboo spear, if necessary. But when Yuriko's papa and Aunt Kimiko both decide to get remarried at the same time, there is still silk to buy for new kimonos.Yuriko has always cherished the time she spends alone with her papa, and wonders if her new stepmother, Sumiyo-san, now living in the family home, along with Akira-san, Aunt Kimiko's new husband, will understand that. Happily, Sumiyo-san turns out to be a loving, kind stepmother who understands. But when the mother of her fired teacher tells her that a man named Nishimoto-san would love to see her, she opens a Pandora's box of family secrets that turns Yuriko's world up-side-down and it is up to Aunt Kimiko to explain things.Yuriko barely has time to digest what Aunt Kimiko tells her, than the war begins to hit closer to home. First Tokyo is badly bombed, and, a few months later, an atomic bomb is dropped on Hiroshima, changing Yuriko's life forever. The Last Cherry Blossom is author Kathleen Burkinshaw's debut novel, and I can only imagine how difficult it must have been to write her mother's story and yet, how necessary. Perhaps having listened to her mother's memories of Japan during WWII and of her survival after the bomb was dropped while growing up is what made this such a realistic narrative. Told in the first person by Yuriko, the reader is pulled into the story right from the start.The Last Cherry Blossom is a shattering story, and part of what makes it so devastating is the detailed descriptions of daily life and favorite special occasions that Yuriko lovingly provides when all the while the reader knows what was coming. I did like reading about the happy times, so filled with Japanese culture, such as how Yuriko's family celebrated the weddings, as well as Oshagatsu (New Year's Celebration) and Sakura Hanami (the Cherry Blossom Festival) and other festivals, though the chohei pati, the celebration party families have when a son is sent to war, is definitely not a happy occasion. It is supposed to be an honor to fight for Japan, but in reality, no one feels very honored. (Burkinshaw does use lots of Japanese words throughout the novel, giving this a real feeling of authenticity, and there is an extensive Glossary in the back matter to help readers.)In fact, the chohei pati points to the ways in which propaganda is used during war by all countries. At the beginning of each chapter, there are quotes from radio addresses, newspapers and propaganda posters about how well Imperial Japan is doing in the war or what is expected of civilians at home, most of which is incorrect, but people are expected to simple believe what they are told.The Last Cherry Blossom is a story of unfathomable loss, but also of hope, resilience, and survival. Paired with Sadako and the Thousand Paper Cranes, both these stories should stand as a cautionary tale about war and the use of what we would now call weapons of mass destruction, and never forget that, as Burkinshaw reminds us in her Afterword, \"the victims were all someone's mother, father, brother, sister, or child.\" It was true then, and is still true today.This book is recommended for readers age 11+This book was an EARC received from Edelweiss/Above the TreelineThis review originally was posted on The Children's War"}, {"userName": "Shenwei", "userReviewDate": "Jul 13, 2017", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/1155048-shenwei", "userReview": "this book takes you through a lot of emotions as you experience events through the eyes of Yuriko, who lives in the shadow of a terrible war whose purpose she does not understand but whose effects she feels deeply nonetheless. it's a moving story of family secrets, love and loss, survival and hope."}, {"userName": "Amber", "userReviewDate": "Jan 02, 2018", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/4372123-amber", "userReview": "Haunting.

But even though the sounds are familiar, she is always worried: Will we actually get bombed? What if the school collapses? Will a desk actually protect me? Is my papa safe? How will I find him if a bomb hits us? (p. 2)With that foreboding introduction, the reader is propelled into Yuriko's world in 1944. Before Yuriko leaves school in this opening scene of The Last Cherry Blossom, she asks her teacher for her grade on her ancestral project she just completed. Yuriko is proud her lineage traces back to samurai warriors in the 1600's. Against the backdrop of her anxiety over the air raid drills, Yuriko does not receive the praise she anticipates. Instead her teacher says, \"That is not right.\"She leaves without telling Yuriko what's wrong with her paper. That question, as well as the appearance of a friendly yet sad stranger, are mysteries snaking through this novel which will appeal to both girl and boy readers. No Longer NormalYuriko's \"normal\" is living with her beloved Papa, her Aunt Kimiko (who she doesn't particularly like) and her pesky, younger cousin Genji, and sharing secrets with her best friend, Machiko. As a member of the upper class she is protected, loved, educated, and the recipient of luxuries like custom-made silk kimonos for the annual cherry blossom festival. Her life begins to change when her widowed father decides to remarry. At the same ceremony Kimiko remarries a man named Akira-san and suddenly the house holds two families instead of one. When an acquaintance alludes to a man named Nishimoto-san who would have loved to see her, Yuriko learns who her true parents are. Like being hit by a bomb, Yurko begins to experience excruciating repercussions in her identity, family, and home life. Burkinshaw's use of lines from newspapers, posters, and radio shows at the beginning of each chapter effectively sets the story within its' historical and political context. The next chapter after Yuriko hears her devastating news is sub-titled, \"No matter what sort of air raid comes, the neighborhood association will be safe.\" Since we know what happened at Hiroshima, the neighborhood association's words foreshadow more bad news for Yuriko. More WorriesRight after Tokyo is bombed, Yuriko walks into a conversation between Akira-san and her papa.  \"Do you really think they will bomb our city?\" I asked, a quaver to my voice.  \"Anything is possible in war.\" As Papa said this my stomach swarmed with butterflies. I ran to him and welcomed his embrace.\"Papa, are we all going to be all right?\" I squeezed tighter. I swear all one hundred million hearts from the radio slogan were beating in my chest. Will fire be raining down on us soon? Maybe we should just live in the bomb shelters? But how is that really living?He hugged me close and then stepped back. He looked at me and said, \"I will keep you safe.\" Akira-san added, \"Our family's safety is our main concern.\" He glanced at Papa. \"But now you should get ready for bed. It is late.\" I nodded and gave him a hug as well. When I got to the door, I turned and asked, \"Papa, do you think we will have school tomorrow?\"I noticed that both he and Akira-san looked up to answer. I did not know what made me feel worse--the fear that this new firebomb could be dropped on Hiroshima next or the tugging of my heart as both men responded to \"Papa.\" (p. 133-4)The Last Cherry Blossom reflects the mixture of cultures present in Japan during World War II. Yuriko's father loves The Three Stooges movies and she and Machiko listen to American jazz. At the same time, the emperor is considered divine and suicide is an honorable option if one falls into enemy hands. Cherry BlossomsThere are many lovely references to cherry blossoms which tie the book together. After attending the annual cherry blossom festival and singing and dancing, Yuriko returns home to a family celebration. Once we were all seated, Papa raises his glass and said, \"Cherry blossoms are like life itself--so beautiful, yet so fragile that they bloom only a short time. A toast to my family and to enjoying our time together. Kanpai!\" (p. 146) Sadly, a few months later, the atomic bomb destroys Yuriko's world. After the bomb is dropped and Hiroshima is devastated, Yuriko faces one loss after another. Overwhelmed by sadness, she is close to giving up her own life. The sight of cherry blossoms falling off a tree help Yuriko choose a path out of despair and into a new life with a new family. As Kathleen Burkinshaw notes in the afterword, \"Originally, scientists said nothing would grow again in Hiroshima soil for many years after the bomb was dropped. Yet the cherry blossoms bloomed the following spring.\" (p. 219)To win my ARC, please leave a comment on my blog (www.carolbaldwinblog.blogspot.com) by July 28, 2016."}, {"userName": "Crystal", "userReviewDate": "Jul 31, 2016", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/938799-crystal", "userReview": "Review copy: Digital ARC The Last Cherry Blossom pulled me into the past and held me there from beginning to end. Yuriko and her family are living in wartime Japan and the author brings readers into their daily life. I thought that the book was mostly going to be about the bomb in Hiroshima, but the vast majority of the book is about life before the bomb. Readers get to see into the everyday activities and worries of children during the war. It was interesting to find out that in the media the government was narrating a story about the war that was inconsistent with what was actually happening. Though the news was announcing victories, you see the clues piling up that show a country at the end of its rope. There is no more metal for constructing more planes, they're looking for alternative fuel because they are running out and they have enough workers to be making more things, but there simply aren't enough supplies.Aside from the war issues, Yuriko is slowly discovering secrets within her family. These secrets will shake her world. Fortunately, Yuriko has a good support system. I love seeing Yuriko's relationships with her family and with her best friend Machiko. Again, the author seemed to aim for showing everyday interactions and typical activities. I really got a sense of what life would have been like for a wealthy young Japanese girl during the war. With Machiko, we also got to see what it was like for someone with less money and standing. Machiko eventually has to start working in a factory by order of the government.And then there is the bomb. Obviously, that is a disturbing part of the book. There is no way to make that day easy to recount. The fear, death, pain, and gruesomeness of such an event is evident. This is an ugly piece of history seen through the eyes of a young girl. War is terrifying and deadly. It's a truth expressed clearly through Yuriko's experiences. This would be an excellent book to use for discussion around war and how it affects the individual people in a country.Readers may want to have some tissues handy, but Yuriko does have a bit of hope at the end which keeps it from being entirely overwhelming for sensitive readers.Following the story, Burkinshaw provides an afterword explaining how the book came to be. It was loosely based on memories of her mother who grew up in Hiroshima and was twelve when the bomb was dropped. She also included a selected bibliography and information about the Japanese words in the book along with a glossary. One thing that had a big impact on me was the page of statistics. When I looked at the numbers after having been immersed in the lives of the people affected, I was overwhelmed. 80,000 people died immediately and 140,000+ died within the next five years. The loss of life is staggering.Recommendation: This is an excellent choice for readers who enjoy historical fiction. It would be a great addition to classroom and school libraries especially if WWII is part of the curriculum and would be perfect for a book club or discussion group."}, {"userName": "Creatyvebooks", "userReviewDate": "Aug 15, 2016", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/30708127-creatyvebooks", "userReview": "Have you ever read a book that guts you from beginning to end and then you try to write a review but you simply can\u2019t get your thoughts in order? Well The Last Cherry Blossom by Kathleen Burkinshaw is that book. Told through the eyes of her mother as a young girl living in Japan during the WWII, Yuriko take us through her daily life. From the simple things in family life (such as her love/hate relationship with her annoying cousin Genji) to her love and devotion for her papa. We the readers get to live through the nervousness and uncertainty of air raids. Not knowing when the next siren will be the one that ends it all.The Last Cherry Blossom is a poignant and beautiful read that I recommend for all ages. Young and old. Quite honestly this books should be mandatory reading in all classes. To know the devastation and sadness that is the product of war. Yes the events of Hiroshima happened over 70 years ago but the wounds are still deep even if the US and Japan have made great strides to repair their relationship.Sadly, in 2016, there are children like Yuriko that are living with the ever present danger of not knowing if this will be their last day on earth. If this day is the day that a drone will do an air strike on their school or hospital because of some technical \u201cmistake.\u201d Or because of some terrorist wanting to make a statement.War is a greedy and nasty business that no child should have to live through and reading The Last Cherry Blossom broke my heart because it made me realize how lucky I am. How lucky my family is that we didn\u2019t have to live in constant fear that our home would be decimated by a bomb or an airstrike. This book will break your heart but it will also get many thought provoking conversations started.

I loved to see the difference and how she changed in little ways and big ways.

When her aunt Kimiko and her obnoxious son Genji move in with her and the privations of war intensify, things are less pleasant. Still, both Kimiko and her father are planning to remarry, and there are plans to be made for the celebration, and family secrets are revealed. When the atomic bomb is dropped on Hiroshima, these secrets are of little consequence in the wake of the devastation to Yuriko's family and home. This is loosely based on the author's mother's experience surviving the bombing, and an extensive glossary is at the back.Strengths: I am always a fan of books that tell me more about what daily life in a particular place at a particular time was like, and this does a good job, with much of the book covering the time period before the bombing. I can't think of another book that covers this topic. The family secret adds another layer of interest to this. Clearly well researched, this also has a strong emotional impact due to the personal touch of the author's mother's experiences. Weaknesses: For some reason, I got distracted by odd details that seemed like they might not have been accurate. We're talking TINY details, like the sewing machine that can do a satin stitch, or some of the food, which seemed heavy on meat that might have been difficult to obtain during the war. Granted, I know absolutely nothing about what went on in Japan, so I was working from a purely US knowledge base.

Of the other side of that infamous bomb. Children may have learned that it served to end the war. But have they ever truly empathized with the children living in Hiroshima when the bomb dropped? In this story, they can, through the eyes and life of twelve year-old Yuriko. We see how much she loves her Papa and her best friend, and how annoying she finds her cousin Genji. We live the air raids with her and travel to the country when Papa sends her to safety. Then we travel back to Hiroshima and experience the horror after the bomb falls. This book would be a great add to any history or social studies class. The topic is handled deftly, not surprising given that the story is based on the experiences of the authors own mother. A story that is useful not only in discussing the tough topic of war, but also in building empathy."}, {"userName": "Jill Diamond", "userReviewDate": "Mar 27, 2016", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/53080969-jill-diamond", "userReview": "The Last Cherry Blossom is the powerful story of Yuriko, a twelve-year-old girl in Hiroshima during World War II. Yuriko is not only dealing with upheaval due to the war, but also must cope with revelations and change in her own family prior to the bombing of her city. In this book, the author crafts a tale of friendship, love, loss and change, and seamlessly weaves in history and Japanese culture. The Last Cherry Blossom is emotionally moving and artfully told from a fresh perspective that is based on the author's mother's own experience. The book gives readers a glimpse of what life was like for a young girl in Japan during this tumultuous period and does a masterful job telling a historical story without being the least bit dry.

The story unfolds through the eyes of twelve-year-old Yuriko, who lives with her beloved papa in a well-to-do household. We meet her best friend Machiko, and her annoying younger cousin, Genji. Life is good, but there is ever-present danger, made real by air raid sirens. And then the Americans drop the atomic bomb. The author's mother was a Hiroshima survivor and THE LAST CHERRY BLOSSOM is loosely based on her experiences. The text has Japanese vocabulary sprinkled throughout. It's usually easy to decipher the meaning, but there's also a helpful glossary in the back. This book would make a wonderful addition for classrooms studying WWII."}, {"userName": "A.E.

The Last Cherry Blossom is a deeply moving evocation of the last months of WW2 in Japan from a young girl's perspective: her friendships, her love for her father, the vicissitudes of family life and how all is lost in the bombing of Hiroshima. Based on Kathleen's mother's own experiences, this is a beguiling novel with a powerful and deeply moving conclusion. A story that needs to be shared."}, {"userName": "Casey Lyall", "userReviewDate": "Jan 20, 2016", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/46235635-casey-lyall", "userReview": "The Last Cherry Blossom is an affecting tale that's beautifully written and gracefully told. It's an incredible story that takes historical events and makes them personal for the reader. Through the eyes of Yuriko, we see her daily life in the days leading up to the bombing of Hiroshima. Family secrets cast a shadow as deep as the on-going war. Yuriko and her best friend have a delightful relationship. I also enjoyed the connection between Yuriko and her papa. They all share sweet moments that make the inevitable conclusion that much harder to bear. The story is based on the author\u2019s mother\u2019s childhood, adding another powerful layer of emotion.

While the country is at war, she and her family haven't experienced too deeply the effects of war. Still, Yuriko notes that things are changing at home as her father and her aunt plan a double wedding, and more and more young men head off to fight. But the human cost of war becomes clear to her when a popular neighbor boy dies while serving in the military. Most of the book leads up to the dropping of the atomic bomb on Hiroshima so that readers are able to glimpse what normal life was like in Japan in 1945. The effects of the bomb are horrific, and Yuriko's life will never be the same again. A meditation on love, loss, and family secrets as well as a vivid account of the effects of a bomb such as this one, the book introduces readers to a protagonist who seems to have a good life and be utterly unprepared for the tragedy that befalls her country and her family. I was pleased to find elements in the story that gave insight into Japanese culture and traditions as well as snippets about how the Japanese government was representing the war to its citizenry, propaganda at its most basic. Although the backdrop of the story is WWII, readers will certainly feel empathy for Yuriko after the blast as she must pick up the pieces of her life and somehow go on, having learned that many of the truths on which she based her own happiness were not true after all. Fourth, fifth, and sixth graders are sure to be riveted by the story and how it explores identity and honor. I can only imagine how hard this book was to write since the author based it on her own mother's experiences in Hiroshima. I am delighted to have read the book and added to what I already knew about Hiroshima. I often wonder what regular people like you and me were thinking and doing during these important historical events."}, {"userName": "Danielle", "userReviewDate": "Aug 02, 2017", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/6868711-danielle", "userReview": "This book is gripping and then devastating.

But her aunt Kimiko and her cousin Genji are living with them now, and the family is only getting bigger with talk of a double marriage! And while things are changing at home, the world beyond their doors is even more unpredictable. World War II is coming to an end, and since the Japanese newspapers don\u2019t report lost battles, the Japanese people are not entirely certain of where Japan stands. Yuriko is used to the sirens and the air-raid drills, but things start to feel more real when the neighbors who have left to fight stop coming home. When the bombs hit Hiroshima, it\u2019s through Yuriko\u2019s twelve-year-old eyes that we witness the devastation and horror.This is a story that offers young readers insight into how children lived during the war, while also introducing them to Japanese culture. Based loosely on author Kathleen Burkinshaw\u2019s mother\u2019s firsthand experience surviving the atomic bombing of Hiroshima, The Last Cherry Blossom hopes to warn readers of the immense damage nuclear war can bring, while reminding them that the \u201cenemy\u201d in any war is often not so different from ourselves.", "title": "The Last Cherry Blossom", "url": "http://www.goodreads.com/book/show/31160055-the-last-cherry-blossom", "average": 4.19, "cover": "https://images.gr-assets.com/books/1468898192l/31160055.jpg", "reviews": 121, "authors": [{"url": "https://www.goodreads.com/author/show/14161865.Kathleen_Burkinshaw", "name": "Kathleen Burkinshaw"}], "type": ["Historical", "Childrens", "Fiction", "Historical", "Cultural"], "outlinks": []}
