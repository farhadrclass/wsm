When my husband and I were newlyweds almost 20 years ago, we were channel surfing one night and saw a fabulous documentary on how Eichmann was found and brought to justice. I think it was the first time I really paid any attention to the story. It was only recently that I heard about this book and I\u2019m so glad that I did. It\u2019s truly well-written and thoroughly researched. Even though I knew how it would all end, I was thinking about the book pretty much during most of my non-reading time, always a sign of a good book for me! This account of General Eisenhower and General Patton seeing the German atrocities for the first time is one that I will always remember. I\u2019d read it another book also.\u201cDespite the intelligence reports General Eisenhower had read on the German atrocities, he found himself completely unprepared for Ohrdurf. Guided by former inmates, he and his staff saw men in the hospital who had been brutally tortured and were starving, lying shoulder to shoulder, expecting nothing more than death to arrive. In a basement, he saw a gallows where prisoners had been hung by piano wire long enough that their toes touched the floor, delaying death but prolonging the agony that preceded it. In one of the yards, he saw some 40 corpses, riddled with lice, stacked in rows. In an adjoining field, he saw 3,200 more corpses, many with gunshot wounds to the back of the head, next to a pyre of wood clearly intended to destroy all traces of their existence. General Omar Bradley, who accompanied Eisenhower, could not even speak; the hard-nosed General George Patton vomited against a wall. As he left Ohrdurf, Eisenhower told his officers, \u2018I want every American unit not actually in the front lines to see this place. We are told that the American soldier does not know what he is fighting for. Now, at least, he will know what he is fighting against.\u2019 Once back at headquarters, the shaken supreme commander sent messages to Washington and London demanding that legislators and newspaper reporters come to Ohrdurf. He wanted these crimes documented.\u201dOne of my favorite quotes:\u201cWe will bring Adolf Eichmann to Jerusalem,\u201d Harel said, striking the table, \u201cand perhaps the world will be reminded of its responsibilities. It will be recognized that, as a people, we never forgot. Our memory reaches back through recorded history.

As it turns out I'd read a lot more nonfiction, if more nonfiction books were like this. Meticulously researched (notes and the bibliography list goes on and on), terrifically told with all the dynamic pacing and heart pumping excitement and suspense of the best of thrillers, but made so much more interesting and compelling by the fact that it actually happened, this account of hunting down, capturing and bringing to justice the Nazi war criminal responsible for countless torture and death of European Jewish population during World War II (the infamous Final Solution) was an absolutely amazing read. Nowadays everyone's imaginations have been made callous by the unrealistic Hollywood movies where things are all way too easy and are usually handled by a single able bodied unbelievably photogenic action star, but this was an actual step by step account of the logistics and practical realities behind the capture. Absolutely fascinating. And these incredibly dangerous risky plans were executed by sometimes by trained and sometimes by ordinary men and women of extraordinary courage. The author did a great job of really bringing these exceptional human beings to life on the pages, showing their motivations, fears and bravery. Bascomb also excelled at fleshing out Eichmann, who was as close to human evil as it gets, remorseless, pathetic and scary all at the same time. Eichmann's trial and execution had an enormous significance in bringing light to the atrocities of Holocaust, now this book brings to light the heroic efforts behind capturing the man. Edmund Burke said that The only thing necessary for the triumph of evil is for good men to do nothing. This is a story of good men doing something to prevent the triumph of evil, this is how things ought to be. I read this book in one day, it was tough to put down and the ending brought tears to my eyes. It was horrifying at times (even to a seasoned horror genre reader), educational, moving, inspirational even. What more could one ask of a book. Highly recommended."}, {"userName": "Bou", "userReviewDate": "Jun 08, 2017", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/5979619-bou", "userReview": "To sum it all up, I must say that I regret nothing. Last words of Adolf Eichmann, the architect of the Final Solution.This book gives a detailed account on how the Mossad managed to capture and flew one of the most notorious SS criminals out of Argentina. Its subsequent process was a milestone in the history of the Shoah - for the first time the World and the Israeli youth was confronted with the Holocaust.His involvement in the Final Solution started with his attendance at the Wannsee conference, where the Final Solution (die Endlosung) was discussed. There he prepared the briefings and a country-by-country breakdown of the 11 million Jews targeted for extermination. He was entrusted with coordinating all matters related to the Final Solution.When the war was over, Eichmann managed to escape. This was partly possible because the Allied Central Registry of War Criminals and Security Suspects (CROWCASS), which managed a list of 70.000 possible war criminals, had not yet identified Adolf Eichmann as a major war criminal. The Allies had yet to learn the degree of his involvement in the Final Solution. It was Tuviah Friedman and Simon Wiesenthal, two Jewish nazi hunters, who laboured night and day to gather survivor testimonials and any evidence that they could find against Eichmann. Their work would lay bare the part that EIchmann had played in the genocide.The start of the Cold War drained the will and resources of the Allies from pursuing war criminals. It was up to Friedman and Wiesenthal to keep the hunt alive.Eichmann in the meantime managed to escape to South America and with the help of a former nazi network and the Vatican, reached Argentina where he was welcomed with open arms. Under his new name Ricardo Klement he was ready to live his new life. Later he was joined by his wife and three sons.It was Wiesenthal who received the first tip that Eichmann was living in Argentina. He approached the Israeli consul, but was told that the Israelis would need more information about Eichmann\u2019s location before engaging in an investigation. He also approached the CIA who responded that they were not in the business of apprehending war criminals.It was one of his sons, Nick Eichmann, who started the chain of events which would end up in the capture of Eichmann. Nick befriended and dated the daughter of Lothar Hermann, a German who migrated to Argentina before the start of the Second World War. Given the comments that Nick had made about his father\u2019s service and the Jews, Lothar was sure he was Eichmann\u2019s son. Unbeknownst to Nick Eichmann, Lothar Hermann was half Jewish, a fact that he had kept hidden for the German community.Hermann decided to write a letter to the Frankfurt prosecutors for the West-German nazi trials, which he had read in the paper. The letter ended up at the desk of Fritz Bauer. After reading the letter, Bauer realised that he had in his hands a solid tip as to the location of one of the architects of the Final Solution.Fritz Bauer requested Interpol to start a search for Eichman, however he was turned down. He also knew that the West-German government would not act. Instead he decided to contact Isser Harel, chief of the Mossad who sent Shaul Darom, to sit with Fritz Bauer. He convinced Isser Harel that the tip seemed solid enough to warrant follow up. However, after some investigation, they were initially convinced that Hermann had the wrong guy and the hunt for Eichmann had come to a halt.However, when Hermann read a news article claiming that Eichmann was living in Kuwait, he decided to contact again. This time he contacted Friedmann, which directed the information back to the Mossad. This resulted in the same tip from two independent sources (Fritz Bauer had never disclosed the identity of Lothar Hermann to the Mossad) mentioning the assumed name of Eichmann twice: Ricardo Klement.It was now that the Israeli\u2019s decided to act. With the approval of Ben-Gurion, they decided to send a Mossad agent, David Aharoni, to further investigate. After some investigation they concluded without any doubt that Richard Klement was in fact Adolf Eichmann.Aharoni now decided to setup a plan to capture Eichmann and transport him back to Israel. They needed to capture Eichmann alive, without being seen or followed. Then they would have to keep him in a secure location, avoiding detection, for an indeterminate period of time, until the plans for the third part of the mission fell into place \u2014 smuggling Eichmann out of Argentina in complete secrecy.Luckily, an El Al plane was scheduled to land at Argentina for some festivities. This was their chance to smuggle Eichmann out of the country. They also wanted to capture Eichmann as soon as possible, to prevent him from becoming suspicious and fleeing the country. This date for capture was set on May 10, while the plane was scheduled to leave at May 19. This meant that they had to capture and hide Eichmann for a total of 9 days.Om May 10 they captured Eichmann, outside his house while he was walking back from work. He was taken back to a safe house, where they had to keep him while waiting for the plane to leave.In the meantime, his wife Vera Eichmann expected the worse: what she had always feared: that those from whom he was running had finally caught up with him. A search by his two sons around Garibaldi Street uncovered Eichmann\u2019s broken glasses, pressed into the mud in the ditch. There was no question now. He had been taken.They decided to act and ask the German community for help But already it was becoming clear to them that they could not depend on the German community for help. No one of their father\u2019s associates wanted nothing to do with them. As for the police, the two brothers could not get their help without revealing their father\u2019s true identity, which might place him in even more danger than he was already in.In the meantime, thanks to the efficient and good preparations, Eichmann was flown out of the country and ready to stand trial in Israel. The trial made the world conscious of the evil that was undertaken to the Jewish people. This consciousness, in Israel and throughout the world, is the enduring legacy of the operation to capture Adolf Eichmann."}, {"userName": "Doubledf99.99", "userReviewDate": "Jul 27, 2014", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/19135352-doubledf99-99", "userReview": "One very good and fast paced book, even though you know the outcome, the author does a fine job of creating tension.

There is no more greater satisfaction than seeing someone of great evil being made to pay for his crimes and few people in history have been guilty of more crimes than Adolf Eichmann. He was the operational manager of the genocide that saw the dispatch and murder of some six million jews during the second world war. In style and content this is a very easy book to read, absorb and accept, at no time are you bombarded with heavy historical facts that could detract from the readability and boys own story telling of the book. Eichmann escaped from Germany at the end of the war and soon made his way to Argentina where he lived in relative obscurity for a number of years. His wife and sons joined him at a later date and the family were always blind to criticism aimed at Eichmann. For such an evil man Adolf Eichmann presented as an unassuming figure, there is no doubt that part of this was due to the fact that he wished to blend into his new surroundings and not draw attention to this evil past. But he had a price on his head and a team of Mossad agents, when they confirmed that it was indeed Eichmann living in Buenos Aires, masterminded a simple yet ingenious plot to \"grab\" Eichmann, keep him hostage and then disguised as an El Al official smuggle him on board an Israeli jet bound for Tel Aviv. You can feel the tension from the moment Eichmann is taken and during his long flight back to receive the justice he so richly deserved, the journey home was filled with danger and the flight arrived in Tel Aviv with just moments of fuel to spare...Phew!!! This is a book that deserves to be read by anyone who has a passing interest in the fate of Hitler's most ardent and fanatical supporters...or indeed if you just love a good, exciting and truthful adventure story, you will not be disappointed and indeed may give a little cheer when the El Al flight crew arrive safely with their precious cargo in Tel Aviv...read enjoy and be thankful this genocidal murderer was brought to justice"}, {"userName": "Ina Cawl", "userReviewDate": "Feb 13, 2016", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/43058347-ina-cawl", "userReview": "you cannot run from your history and your victims"}, {"userName": "Tony", "userReviewDate": "Jul 16, 2013", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/1361000-tony", "userReview": "HUNTING EICHMANN. (2009). Neal Bascomb. ****.This is a well-written and focused exploration of how Eichmann was located, hunted down, and captured by the Israelis from his hideout in Argentina. After a short overview of Eichmann\u2019s personal history while growing up and then to his career within Hitler\u2019s Third Reich, the story directs its attention to the planning involved in his capture and subsequent transport to Israel. Although most of us of a certain age remember the headlines of the period, the details have become hazy over time. I can remember following the trial on TV when I should have been working at one or another of my graduate courses, but Eichmann was riveting. The image of this man in the glass booth will be forever etched on my mind. If you are not of a certain age, then this book will provide you with an essential overview of Eichmann\u2019s crimes and the environment in which such crimes became possible. It will also give the reader an idea of the work that went into the planning and execution of those plans to successfully extract him from Buenos Aires and transport him to Israel. There\u2019s lots here that we didn\u2019t know about during the actual events, but are here presented in a concise but informative way.

It makes a good companion piece to the essay in The Norton Reader: An Anthology of Nonfiction written by one of the \"hunters\". Bascomb doesn't waste words and doesn't waste description. He also is kind enough to presume that his reader has basic background knowledge, so he doesn't give unneeded explanations. Outside of the hunt for Eichmann what is also engrossing is the development of the intelligence agency."}, {"userName": "Caitlin", "userReviewDate": "Nov 14, 2009", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/2209914-caitlin", "userReview": "Adolf Eichmann was the model for Hannah Arendt's banality of evil. Kafka could not have written a more bloodless bureaucrat than Eichmann - the Chief Operating Officer of the Final Solution. Although he was manifestly responsible for the deaths of 6 million or more Jews, Communists, prisoners of war, Gypsies, political dissidents, homosexuals, mentally retarded people, and anyone else who had the misfortune to be caught in the wheels of the Nazi system, he never accepted responsibility. He was just following orders. \"I never killed anyone ... I was involved in collection and transport.\"Hunting Eichmann tells the story of the 15-year hunt for Adolf Eichmann after the War ended. Eichmann had been last seen in Hungary, overseeing the systematic murder of over 430,000 Hungarians before fleeing the country in 1945. Captured by the Americans under a false name in 1946, Eichmann escaped them and eventually made his way to Argentina where a community of expatriate Nazis waited to welcome him.Bascomb's book is the most comprehensive story of how Eichmann was tracked down yet written. Bascomb had access to extensive written materials all over the world that have recently become declassified. In addition, he was able to interview every major player in the story of the capture. It is clear from reading the book that the US and the Europeans were invested in ignoring the Nazis that were left unprosecuted after Nuremberg because bringing them and their stories to light would have also shed light on the number of prominent ex-Nazis working for the U.S. and various other European governments. By the time WWII ended everyone was primarily concerned with fighting Communism and looked the other way when convenient.Had it not been for the relentless bravery of Nazi hunters like Simon Wisenthal and Tuviah Friedman the case might have gone cold, but their work along with the work of concentration camp survivors in Argentina identified and located Eichmann. The Israelis were tipped off to his location by a West German prosecutor and the capture was on. This team of a dozen Israelis - over half of whom were concentration camp survivors or who had lost their entire families to the camps - went to Argentina to pick him up. That they did so was pretty amazing. That they managed to hold him for 10 days without murdering him outright, despite how soul sucking being in his presence was, is nothing short of a miracle.This book reads like the best fictional spy stories you've ever read. The history is fascinating and the writing is gripping.

He wanted her to run his business while he and his wife went to Isreal for Eichmann 's trial. I was nine years old at the time and had no knowledge of WWII and the Holocaust. My mother said the Herzog family went to spit on Eichmann because all of their families had been killed in the camps. I couldn't understand why that was so important. It started me on a lifetime of reading all I could on the war and the people affected by a regime that wanted to run the world and be populated only with people they approved of. This story of the hunt and capture of a war criminal filled in years that dedicated agents and civilians gave of themselves to seek justice in a lawful manner. I only wish I had been old enough and aware enough to have talked to the Herzog's about their feelings at the trial when a guilty verdict was given. I think of them every time I read anything about the Holocaust and hope they felt some sense of justice for their fathers and mothers and siblings and their extended families. I hope everyone got a bit of peace and relief in bringing a killer to justice. It is unimaginable that there are people that are willing and able to do horrible things to their fellow human beings. The perseverance of the Israelis is the heart of this story.

With the release of this book I thought I'd take a deeper interest in what happened, how the operation was organized, and the background to the entire event. In the end I think this book delivers. Although the research is there, the book lacks in the usual endnote citations a scholarly work includes. Rather you can follow page numbers in the back and try to see which few words, designating the beginning of a sentence, are followed by a source, which is where the information in that sentence, and perhaps what follows, comes from. This is a bit annoying at times, but better than no endnotes at all.Bascomb's impressive research is matched by a writing style that makes this narrative read more like a novel than a work of non-fiction. Although we already know the basic details about Eichmann's kidnapping, we are still on the edge of our seats as the author skillfully and suspensefully describes the false starts, glitches, close calls, political complications, subterfuge, and intricate logistics that made this operation so perilous. If any members of the Israeli team were to be captured on Argentinean soil, not only might Eichmann escape, but their failed effort would undoubtedly cause an embarrassing international incident, and the image of the Israeli government would suffer irreparable damage. There was a huge amount at stake, and failure simply was not an option.There is so much to praise in this book: the effortless, precise, and understated prose; the striking photos showing Eichmann in his youth and shortly before his execution; the ways in which Bascomb places this monumental event in historical and cultural context; and the impressive footnotes, bibliography, and index. Eichmann's trial, with its extensive testimony and documentation about the Final Solution, educated Israeli youth about the tragedy of the Jewish annihilation at the hands of the Nazis. Furthermore, it \"rooted the Holocaust in the collective cultural consciousness.\" The trial \"stirred a debate\" that led to an \"outpouring of survivor memoirs, scholarly works, plays, novels, [and] documentaries\" that continues to this day.Also noteworthy is Bascomb's depiction of Eichmann's twisted personality and delusional thinking. In addition, the author takes the time to explore the backgrounds, traumatic memories, and ultimately, the pride mixed with terror of each Israeli who took part in the abduction and its aftermath. As Isser Harel, the head of the Mossad, tells his men: \"You were chosen by destiny to guarantee that one of the worst criminals of all time, who for years has succeeded in evading justice, would be made to stand trial.\" At last, the Jews had the opportunity to judge their killers. \"Hunting Eichmann\" is an eye-opening and detailed look at an important chapter in the history of genocide.What I really appreciated about this text is the fact that you see these Mossad agents for who they are, not supermen, but ordinary human beings with a past (a past that the majority inherited from the Holocaust) and in their humanity can easily complicate any and every perfectly created plan. From beginning to end this was an operation that with one false step could send the entire mission off course with repercussions none could predict for certain; luck, detective work, and a superior work ethic is what made the difference. Also, I found it interesting, and at the same time horrifying, that such a person like Eichmann can exist. To be so entrenched in one's beliefs and removed from his actions is simply beyond reason. Then again, he had fifteen years to convince himself that what he did was simply to follow orders, even if those orders came from a genocidal authoritarian regime. That Mossad agents were able to be around him and come face-to-face with one of Hitler's most ruthlessly efficient bureaucrats is hard to fathom; that they could restrain themselves from doing violence to him after having first hand knowledge of what went on during the Holocaust and the suffering he caused, is commendable. A recommended book that brings a lot of literature, interviews, and primary sources together on the subject."}, {"userName": "Todd Stockslager", "userReviewDate": "Jun 05, 2015", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/43477226-todd-stockslager", "userReview": "I rarely rate nonfiction five stars (\"What a classic\" on my personal rating scale), but Hunting Eichmann deserves this highest accolade in every way.1. The importance of the subject. Six million people were murdered in Europe during World War II by the German government, under the leadership and direction of Adolf Hitler, at the administrative hand of Adolf Eichmann who crafted and carried out the Final Solution. Multiplying adjectives such as Jewish, refugees, deportees, old, young, infirm, incompetent, all, while in some cases accurate, detract from the bare statement of fact: six million people were murdered in Europe during World War II by the German government, under the leadership and direction of Adolf Hitler, at the administrative hand of Adolf Eichmann who crafted and carried out the Final Solution.2. The impact of the story. No matter how it is told, Eichmann's escape from Allied camps in the chaotic early post-war days in Germany, his clandestine survival in Europe and then Argentina for 15 more years, his capture and deportation to Israel, and finally his trial and execution, is an amazing story. In Bascomb's hand, it cracks like the best John Le Carre spy novel, only stronger in its impact because of its truth. I was struck by the ability to so easily disappear in a world before surveillance cameras, cell phones, GPS devices, high-resolution satellite photos, long range detection devices, and computer information tracking and matching systems. Conversely, it is also hard to imagine a covert intelligence operation in a foreign country with so many agents going undetected in today's world with all those technologies.3. The intelligence of the storyteller. Bascomb writes with a spare prose that doesn't distract from the subject or the story. He seldom reaches for lofty wording that diminishes the bare authenticity of the story. His footnotes provide documentation for his occasional third-person omniscient constructions (\"He thought that . . . \" or \"He wished that . . . \"). This quality of writing and level of attention to detail is sadly missing too often in today's nonfiction.Finally, the persistence and planning of the Israeli operatives, driven by their holy burning motivation, is a lesson we must remember in our post-modern world where nothing matters. We may think we live in the world John Lennon \"Imagined\"--no Heaven, no Hell, nothing worth dieing for, and only today to live for--but we're wrong.

Author Neal Bascomb tells the story of Adolf Eichmann, who was the operational commander of the Holocaust. \"Hunting Eichamnn\" tells the incredible story of how Eichmann fled Europe in 1945 and was ultimately brought to justice in 1961.The reader knows the ultimate outcome of the story at the beginning--Eichmann is captured. But the tale on how it came to be is so incredible as to a great case of \"truth is stranger than fiction.\" Bascomb tells of all the little details that the capture team had to take care of. Every contingency was anticipated and planned for: where they were going to snatch Eichmann, how would they subdue him, what if the car was followed by the police, and so on. The first part of the book tells of the life and career of Adolf Eichmann and how he came to be the world's most wanted Nazi war criminal. Eichmann was the operational commander of the Holocaust, meaning he handled the day to day decisions in the Nazi program of death. He was guilty as guilty gets. Eichmann could not later claim he \"didn't know what was going on\" because it was his job to take care of rounding up and transporting Jews to the death camps.The second part of the book tells of Eichmann's escape from Europe, how he did it, what help he received, and where he ended up in South America. Bascomb tells of Eichmann's life there, along side with the progress of his case in Europe. The man players of who was looking for Eichmann and why are detailed. The third part of the book details of how Eichmann was found, how he was located in Argentina. As described above, Bascomb writes with great detail of all the little details that had to anticipated and planned for to successfully capture Eichmann. One of the major problems was his pursuers didn't have a good photograph of him. Eichmann was a clever man.The book was not on the New York Times Bestseller list for some odd reason.

The details of the planning and actual capture of Eichmann are much like the details of the planning and execution of plans by Gabriel Allon and his team in the Daniel DeSilva novels and just as tension filled. In addition to the planning and actual capture, attention is also given to Eichmann -- how he got to be responsible for carrying out the Final Solution and how he evaded capture post-war and escaped to Argentina.

Logo ap\u00f3s, foi julgado e condenado \u00e0 morte em Jerusal\u00e9m por sua contribui\u00e7\u00e3o ao holocausto, nesta que foi a primeira e \u00fanica aplica\u00e7\u00e3o da pena de morte em toda a hist\u00f3ria de Israel. Os relatos dessa opera\u00e7\u00e3o, contudo, somente vieram \u00e0 tona h\u00e1 pouco tempo. Sabe-se hoje, por exemplo, que a opera\u00e7\u00e3o n\u00e3o foi promovida por agentes privados, como alegado por algumas autoridades da \u00e9poca, mas que possu\u00eda o aval oficial de David Ben Gurion, Primeiro-Ministro de Israel e um dos l\u00edderes do movimento sionista. Neal Bascomb, inspirado em alguns desses documentos rec\u00e9m divulgados, bem como em diversas de suas entrevistas, aborda em sua obra os detalhes e a log\u00edstica desse marcante evento da hist\u00f3ria, que posteriormente foi trabalhado por Hannah Arendt no livro Eichmann em Jerusal\u00e9m.O livro se destaca por abordar n\u00e3o somente os elementos f\u00e1ticos que caracterizaram a opera\u00e7\u00e3o, mas igualmente o aspecto psicol\u00f3gico dos indiv\u00edduos e agentes envolvidos. Neal Bascomb nos mostra um cen\u00e1rio com os agentes do rec\u00e9m-criado Mossad, suas hist\u00f3rias e motiva\u00e7\u00f5es pessoais, sua ang\u00fastia ap\u00f3s a captura de Eichmann, ao saberem se encontrar nos mesmos aposentos de um dos maiores gerentes da \u201csolu\u00e7\u00e3o final\u201d e do genoc\u00eddio dos judeus, e a tens\u00e3o dos diversos momentos em que a opera\u00e7\u00e3o quase fracassou por pequenos detalhes. O autor tamb\u00e9m aborda a hist\u00f3ria de guerra de Eichmann, detalha as a\u00e7\u00f5es que perpetrou na Hungria, sua fuga ap\u00f3s a invas\u00e3o sovi\u00e9tica, seu per\u00edodo de clandestinidade at\u00e9 a chegada na Argentina, o amor por sua mulher e seus filhos \u2013 que o leva a traz\u00ea-los para o pa\u00eds \u2013 bem como sua moderada vaidade ou a sua paran\u00f3ia de ser algum dia finalmente encontrado. Trata-se de um relato fascinante, que aproxima o leitor dos bastidores da diplomacia e da espionagem da Guerra Fria.Algo que o livro n\u00e3o aborda \u00e9 a quest\u00e3o da legalidade da opera\u00e7\u00e3o. O jurista internacionalista Francisco Rezek, ex-Ministro de Rela\u00e7\u00f5es Exteriores e Juiz da Corte Internacional de Justi\u00e7a, classifica este tipo de a\u00e7\u00e3o pelo nome de \u201cabdu\u00e7\u00e3o internacional\u201d, sendo uma variante ilegal da extradi\u00e7\u00e3o. Rezek cita, em sua obra, Direito Internacional P\u00fablico, tr\u00eas famosos casos de abdu\u00e7\u00f5es internacionais: a abdu\u00e7\u00e3o de Adolph Eichmann na Argentina, em 1960; a do Coronel Antoine Argoud em Munique, na Alemanha, em 1963; e a de Humberto Alvarez-Machain, no M\u00e9xico, em 1990. Ap\u00f3s a abdu\u00e7\u00e3o de Eichmann, o Conselho de Seguran\u00e7a das Na\u00e7\u00f5es Unidas adotou uma resolu\u00e7\u00e3o no sentido de que esse tipo de a\u00e7\u00e3o constitu\u00eda uma viola\u00e7\u00e3o \u00e0 soberania dos Estados e uma amea\u00e7a \u00e0 paz internacional, e que o governo de Israel deveria promover uma \u201crepara\u00e7\u00e3o adequada\u201d ao governo da Argentina. Conforme Rezek, a \u00fanica forma de repara\u00e7\u00e3o adequada seria, neste caso, o retorno do indiv\u00edduo ao Estado de origem.A abdu\u00e7\u00e3o internacional seria, portanto, por sua pr\u00f3pria natureza, incompat\u00edvel com o direito internacional, por constituir uma viola\u00e7\u00e3o ao princ\u00edpio da soberania. Esse era o meu entendimento antes de ler a presente obra. Contudo, o livro de Neal Bascomb me obrigou a rever esse posicionamento. \u00c9 um fato que, nesses anos que seguiram o p\u00f3s-guerra, n\u00e3o havia nenhum interesse por parte da comunidade internacional de encontrar, julgar e condenar criminosos de guerra. O lema que se reproduzia era apenas um: esque\u00e7a. Tal como um paciente em luto, a sociedade alem\u00e3 buscava legar ao recalque as mem\u00f3rias dos horrores cometidos na Segunda Guerra.Diversos eventos simb\u00f3licos demonstravam essa dimens\u00e3o profunda da sociedade. Criminosos de guerra eram recebidos de bra\u00e7os abertos em diversos pa\u00edses, como na Argentina de Per\u00f3n, ou nos Estados Unidos, onde muitos oficiais nazistas foram integrados \u00e0 CIA. Na Rep\u00fablica Federal da Alemanha, o Chanceler Konrad Adenauer tamb\u00e9m estava mais preocupado com a estabilidade e a integra\u00e7\u00e3o europ\u00e9ia do que com a persegui\u00e7\u00e3o de nazistas. Apenas alguns poucos indiv\u00edduos, como o promotor Fritz Bauer \u2013 respons\u00e1vel pelos processos de Auschwitz, e cuja audaz contribui\u00e7\u00e3o na captura de Eichmann \u00e9 relatada no livro \u2013 se preocupavam com um princ\u00edpio fundamental que foi legado pela Segunda Guerra, e que justificou a cria\u00e7\u00e3o de todos os Tribunais Penais Internacionais subseq\u00fcentes: a id\u00e9ia de que h\u00e1 certas a\u00e7\u00f5es que s\u00e3o inescus\u00e1veis, independente de terem sido levadas a cabo pelo cumprimento de ordens de superiores, pelo fato de constitu\u00edrem crimes contra a humanidade, e aqueles que perpetraram esses crimes devem ser devidamente processados e condenados.\u00c9 pouco prov\u00e1vel que Eichmann teria sido levado \u00e0 justi\u00e7a caso n\u00e3o fossem as a\u00e7\u00f5es do Mossad na Argentina em 1960. Juan Domingo Per\u00f3n n\u00e3o possu\u00eda nenhum interesse de julgar criminosos de guerra. Pelo contr\u00e1rio, nesse per\u00edodo fugitivos nazistas eram recebidos de bra\u00e7os abertos na Argentina, sua vinda era inclusive incentivada \u2013 conforme indicam documentos liberados recentemente \u2013 e muitos passaram a integrar a burocracia estatal ap\u00f3s sua chegada. Tudo nos leva a crer que, caso n\u00e3o fossem as a\u00e7\u00f5es de Israel, um dos maiores criminosos de guerra do S\u00e9culo XX, e um dos maiores encarregados \u201csolu\u00e7\u00e3o final da quest\u00e3o judia\u201d, teria permanecido impune. Seu julgamento foi um evento marcante para que o mundo voltasse novamente suas aten\u00e7\u00f5es para o genoc\u00eddio da Segunda Guerra, e se lembrasse de um fato que muitos se esfor\u00e7avam em esquecer.Al\u00e9m disso, o julgamento de Eichmann tamb\u00e9m levantou um importante questionamento acerca da natureza do mal. Hannah Arendt aborda este tema principalmente em dois de seus livros: Eichman em Jerusal\u00e9m: um relato sobre a banalidade do mal, e Responsabilidade e Julgamento, sendo este uma resposta \u00e0s criticas recebidas por raz\u00e3o de sua primeira obra.Ocorre que Eichmann, apesar de ter sido demonizado, e ter incorporado em sua figura, durante o jugamento, tudo o que o nazismo e o holocausto representavam, n\u00e3o era um monstro. Era simplesmente um homem, uma mera engrenagem de uma m\u00e1quina. Eichmann possu\u00eda uma apar\u00eancia comum, em nada perversa, funesta ou sinistra, pelo contr\u00e1rio, possu\u00eda uma apar\u00eancia de mediocridade, era um membro da baixa classe m\u00e9dia, extremamente obediente e subserviente. Isser Harel, um dos agentes do Mossad que integrava a opera\u00e7\u00e3o, inclusive se espanta ao v\u00ea-lo, e se questiona: \u201cSeria este realmente o mensageiro da morte dos judeus, respons\u00e1vel pelo assassinato de seis milh\u00f5es de pessoas?\u201d. De fato, Eichmann era um burocrata. Em seu julgamento afirma: \u201cEu sentava em minha mesa e fazia o meu trabalho\u201d. Alegava n\u00e3o odiar os judeus, mas meramente cumprir as ordens de seus superiores. O julgamento de Eichnmann \u00e9 importante, pois nos lembra das imensas atrocidades que podem ser cometidas em nome do argumento da necessidade do cumprimento de ordens.Segundo Hannah Arendt, h\u00e1 um Eichmann em todos n\u00f3s. A banalidade do mal significa a incapacidade do ser humano de pensar, de questionar, que produz uma massa de homens incapazes de formular um ju\u00edzo cr\u00edtico, integrantes de sistemas totalitaristas. Conforme a autora, \u201cos grandes perpetradores do mal s\u00e3o aqueles que nunca se lembram, porque nunca se envolveram na atividade de pensar, nada pode ret\u00ea-los, porque sem recorda\u00e7\u00f5es eles est\u00e3o sem ra\u00edzes.\u201d \u00c9 neste sentido que a autora aponta a import\u00e2ncia fundamental da filosofia e da teoria pol\u00edtica, que seria, portanto, a de nos tornar capazes de exercer constantemente as capacidades de julgamento, de consci\u00eancia e de mem\u00f3ria."}, {"userName": "Eric Sondermann", "userReviewDate": "Mar 04, 2018", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/21558812-eric-sondermann", "userReview": "Loved this book.

But Neal Bascomb seems to realize early on the difficulty of writing it that way and maintaining the \"action,\" especially with a decade long break in the middle. Instead, he proceeds to write a study of ordinary people, who became involved in momentous events.Adolf Eichmann was an officer in the German SS during World War II, and \"architect\" of the murder of well more than six million human beings. Bascomb, in a careful, cogent manner manages the difficult task of explaining just how he did this, just how the Jewish communities of Europe were lulled into thinking they would trade a few liberties for promises of safety, and how much pride Eichmann took in betraying those promises. After the war, Eichmann tries to conduct a Guerilla war, hides out under a succession of assumed names, and eventually manages to escape to Argentina with the help of a succession of sympathizers. This part of the book is actually quite slow, through no fault on the part of Bascomb. He diligently relates the lack of co-ordinated search, since Germany wanted to put the war behind them, the Allies were fighting the early days of the Cold War, and Israel was fighting for statehood. This becomes the story of several dedicated people who continued the hunt, names like Simon Wiesenthal, Tuviah Friedman, Lothar Hermann and West German Prosecutor Fritz Bauer.Not until 1960 was enough evidence gathered that Isser Harel and the Israeli Shin Bet and Mossad finally took action. The book examines the crew that was sent to capture Eichmann, telling the stories of men who lost family members to this man and now had the chance to bring him to justice. But instead of being a tale of snarling revenge or epic heroism, this is more of a trial for the team, facing doubts, fears of failure, and a task that the movies make out to be easy, yet which in reality was very difficult.There are some incredibly emotional moments in this book, like when Israeli President David Ben-Gurion announces the capture before the Knesset, or when capture team member Peter Malkin, ends years of silence and admits his role in history to his mother on her deathbed.But for the most part, Bascomb is very low-key in his writing, focusing on the fascinating humanity demonstrated. He looks at the Nazi hunters, Wiesenthal and Friedman who did their part many times over, but could never quite manage to stop or move on from the hunt. He looks at the toll taken on the Mossad team, who set out to capture a monster and were shocked to discover that it had turned into a frail, impoverished, terrified man. He looks at the fascinating character of Peter Malkin, intelligence strong man who later left that life behind to be an artist, who makes all of this possible: not when he grabs Eichmann and stuffs him into a car, but later on when he manages to talk to his enemy as a person, convincing Eichmann to agree to be extradited.The book has a slow second act, and lacks for action. But considering the actual events involved years of hiding, months of planning, and about 30 seconds of actual action, Bascomb is to be commended for his steady approach and even handed assessment. A very well done piece of history!"}, {"userName": "Regina Lindsey", "userReviewDate": "Sep 25, 2012", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/6693237-regina-lindsey", "userReview": "Hunting Eichmann by Neal Bascomb4 StarsThe world\u2019s view of bringing Nazi war criminals to justice changed drastically between 1945 and 1960. The US and Great Britain were in the throes of the Cold War and responsibility was relegated to Germany, who had allowed numerous former Nazis to hold important government posts. In 1960 former Nazis accounted for 1/3 of the cabinet and eight served as foreign ambassadors. So, when Adolf Eichmann was suspected of hiding in the enclave of an Argentinian German community it was left to the Israelis to bring him to justice if it were to ever occur. On May 11, 1960, a covert Mossad led operation captured Eichmann on his way home from work, secretly transported him out of the country on El Al\u2019s first flight ever into the country, tried him, convicted him, and sentenced him to death (the first and only death sentence to date in Israel). The first part of the story provides a good historical context for the atrocities committed by Eichmann as the operational manager of the Final Solution, his escape over the Austrian Alps after being in U.S. custody for over six months to Argentina where Peron had created a welcoming community for former Nazis, and his life in hiding. The second part of the book deals with his extraction and trial. While the reader knows how the story ends, Bascomb does an excellent job of creating a great deal of suspense around the Mossad operations. But, there is a more important theme of the tale. Did Israel have the right to go onto foreign soil to capture Eichmann? More importantly, did they have the authority, as a state that hadn\u2019t been created during WWII, to try and execute Eichmann? There are no easy answers and even I don\u2019t know how I feel about it. Obviously, as someone who studies this era pretty thoroughly I\u2019m glad Eichamann faced the consequences of his actions. There is no way to characterize him other than as a plain and simple monster. But, the actions of Israel could have set a dangerous precedent. I suppose in the end, for me, it is one more piece of sad evidence of the ramifications of actions during the Cold War."}, {"userName": "Dolores", "userReviewDate": "Jul 31, 2013", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/16607652-dolores", "userReview": "This is an amazing, true story about the search for and capture of Adolph Eichmann, the Nazi who was responsible for implementing Hitler's Final Solution. This reads like a suspense novel that you can't stop reading, even though you know the ending. Eichmann's background and his notorious war deeds are reviewed, as well his self-serving justification for his actions.The book also tells the story and background of the Israelis agents of Mossad, the Israeli version of the CIA, who were involved in tracking him down. The chase to find him and the planning of his abduction is detailed and suspenseful. When the Israelis finally identify him in hiding in Argentina, the Mossad agents implement a daring plot to seize him and bring him to Israel. His whereabouts were unknown since the end of the war and, so his capture and trial in Israel electrifies the world. It's also an important achievement for the new country; he's the first Nazi tried in Israel and held accountable for his key role in the Holocaust. Eichmann was also the first and only convicted criminal to be executed by Israel.An interesting point made in the book is that immediately following the war and the creation of the Israeli state, the Holocaust wasn't as thoroughly discussed, studied and analyzed as it is today. Eichmann's capture and trial in the early 1960s reminded the world about the atrocities of the Holocaust and opened the way for more open discussion and recognition of its victims."}, {"userName": "Tung", "userReviewDate": "Nov 11, 2013", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/763514-tung", "userReview": "When we think of the monstrous leaders from WWII Germany, we think of Hitler, Goebbels, Goring, and Mengele; we should also consider Adolf Eichmann.

He was most known for clearing out Jewish people from Hungary and sending them off to concentration camps. This book details the search for Eichmann after his escape from Germany at the end of the war. Bascomb details how the Israeli secret service received info about Eichmann\u2019s location (Argentina), how they carried out a lengthy stakeout to confirm his location, and how they pulled off an incredibly taut mission to capture him on foreign soil and to smuggle him back to Israel to face trial for his war crimes. The chapters detailing his capture were as unbelievably tense as you can imagine. It is also as emotionally difficult to get through as other books on the holocaust. There were some pacing issues, as in my opinion, Bascomb was almost too detailed in his reporting of events; parts of the middle chapters dragged for me as I waited to get to the capture operation.

It was originally thought he was killed at the end of the War, but in truth he escaped to Argentina with his wife and four sons, where he lived for many years under an assumed identity before being captured by an Israeli group called the Mossad. The beginning of the book, detailing Eichmann's activities during the War, and the end, describing his capture and trial, were very interesting, but the middle was overly detailed for me, chronicling Eichmann's every move and all the twists and turns of the investigation.What this book DID do for me was make me more curious about other Holocaust figures and about the Nuremberg Trial.

However, this book told more of the story of who Eichmann was before the capture and it talked about the international reaction after his capture. It also discussed the trial and the results on the nation of Israel. One of the interesting things is reading about how he justified his actions. He stated that he felt he was right with God and he had done no wrong. Prior to his capture he dictated his memoirs to an author who published after his cature. He spent quite a bit of time justifiying himself there to so he obviously felt defensive about his record. This book does talk about some of the survivors of the holocaust and what Eichmann was responsible for.
