And it is on this trip that the story soars. \u00a0Seth is a very serious lad who takes his own responsibility for the things that happen around him way too seriously for his age. \u00a0He is so cautious and concerned about how his own behaviour is affecting August, he can scarce relax and enjoy the bounties of the trip. \u00a0Henry is another responsibility that Seth takes upon himself. \u00a0Henry is quiet and shy, \u00a0making himself as small as humanly possible, while still actually being with them. \u00a0Point of fact is Henry does not speak at all, except perhaps maybe just to Seth but August has not seen any sign of that either. \u00a0In an effort to get these boys to relax and enjoy nature\u2019s awesome bounty without coming across as preachy or overbearing August adapts a gentle, friendly, non confrontational approach that is ever mindful of the responsibility he has accepted. \u00a0\u00a0As Seth and Henry begin to unwind and become more comfortable with him and begin to actively participate in the adventure, the tables slowly turn and August finds himself gaining as much sound practical advice as he is giving. \u00a0He also learns a great deal more about their home lives and how it was that their father was prepared to make the unheard of deal with August that he has. \u00a0Never preachy or maudlin and without even a hint of saccharine this camping trip builds a foundation on which the boys will build the rest of their lives while providing August with enough emotional sustenance to see him safely to shore. \u00a0An incredibly heart warming camping trip through America\u2019s stunning parklands and outdoor reserves . \u00a0An absolute must read. \u00a05 fan freakin tastic stars!"}, {"userName": "Mike Patterson", "userReviewDate": "Jul 23, 2014", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/22700722-mike-patterson", "userReview": "Got caught in my throat more than once in this story.

Not just with Seth and younger brother Henry, but with August and felt for him in his grief at the death of his son. Woody, August\u2019s little Jack Russell won his way into my heart too. From the first page I knew this book would hook me right in. It is simply but powerfully written and shows clearly that it is often the family that suffers along with the alcoholic. This is perhaps not a book where the reader will be wowed by the beautiful prose. It is the characters that make this story so memorable. The story is told simply and honestly. There were some passages filled with wisdom like this from a relatively minor character, Emory. \u2018I\u2019ve see a lot of people walk a lot of roads. Some not so happy. And it makes them what they are. So if you run around putting a pillow under people to cushion their fall\u2026 well, I\u2019m just not sure it\u2019s quite the favor we think it is.\u2019 And this from August, the recovering alcoholic. \u2018I drove when I\u2019d been drinking too. But I never got into an accident. And now who the hell am I to act like I\u2019m better than her (his ex-wife) because she was sitting at a red light when someone ran it? And I wasn\u2019t? That\u2019s luck. That\u2019s not to my credit. We\u2019re responsible for everything. Everything we do. Not just when it backfires on us.\u2019 I could have quoted plenty of others.This book relies on involving the emotions and it sure did with me. I laughed, I was teary at times and at other times downright angry. To begin with I struggled to believe a man would hand his children over so readily to someone they had just met and expect him to care for them during the summer. But then I have never been as desperate as Wes. Once you accept this fact on which the plot hinges, the rest falls into place. For me, the only part where I lost concentration a little was later in the book with the emphasis on climbing, and just a couple of things I thought could have been resolved a little better at the end. Still, well worth reading if you like a book that tugs at the emotions, makes you think and has well drawn characters that you will care about. I will definitely be seeking out more books by this author."}, {"userName": "Elaine", "userReviewDate": "Jul 09, 2014", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/13060256-elaine", "userReview": "The main character of this book is August, a man of a certain age, a science teacher who is taking an RV trip. Just those two facts \u2013 the science and the RV meant that throughout this read I had Walter White in my head and read all of August\u2019s dialogue in Walter\u2019s voice.But, to be serious, this is the second book that I have read by the author lately and, like Where We Belong, the main theme of this book is a friendship between the generations. Similarly, we have a man who is intrinsically good, doing the right thing for other people, even though he may have serious doubts about the wisdom of what he is doing.Oh, and there is also another cute dog \u2013 this time a Jack Russell called Woody.August, a recovering alcoholic, is mourning the death of his son Phillip two years ago, and as a memorial to him is taking an RV trip from California to Yellowstone Park. What he hasn\u2019t bargained for is being \u201ccoerced\u201d into taking along two young children, Seth and Henry. He unwittingly becomes a role model for the boys and, in turn, we see him learning how to move forward in his mourning of his son. I really enjoyed reading about their road trip, the scenery and places they visited. I really felt quite envious of everything they saw and experienced.The book also studies \u201crisk\u201d. It encourages you to live life to the full because you never know what is around the corner, and if your passions run to activities that could be risky then to take calculated risks; enjoy the moment as safely as possible. I have a fear of heights, but I was still intrigued by the climbing section of the book. I read some of it wincing.It is a very uplifting, feel good read with nice characters that you cannot help liking. A couple of times I did think the book was about to stray into \u201ctwee territory\u201d but the author managed to turn it round, so it didn\u2019t get sickly sweet, just a darn good read.Thanks to the publishers for the copy in return for an honest review."}, {"userName": "Carole", "userReviewDate": "Apr 02, 2014", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/7630646-carole", "userReview": "If you're the type that enjoys character rich stories, and you haven't read a book by Catherine Ryan Hyde, then I suggest you start right here.

I started reading her books and soon became obsessed with reading everything she had written. Many of her books make me think that her original idea comes from a small 2\" blurb from Page 4 of the local paper and that she then tells the story behind the blurb. Whether it is the story of Grace alittle girl, whose mother is too befuddled by drugs to care for her.(Don't let me go) She makes a community of her building by befriending the agoraphobic former Broadway dancer who hasnt left his home in a decade. Or When I Found You, about Nathan, the middle aged childless man who finds a new born in the woods while he is duck hunting. She generally features children in her stories, children who are in large measure raising themselves, but are not pathetic. They are resourceful and have been lucky enough to encounter adults who are willing to step in to their lives to help them grow to productive adults. The children have the resourcefulness and resiliance we wish that all kids in those circumstances and the adults most often grow into the people that the children need. Take Me With You is that kind of a book. Their father is not a horrible person, just a flawed one, who really wants to do right by his kids but alcohol gets in the way. August too is flawed and damaged...but has learned,too late for his own son, that alcohol is not his friend. Almost against his will, he finds himself with a second chance to make a difference in a child's life. Ms Hyde's books are not maudlin or sappy but instead are filled with believable characters that make us want to root for their success. I look forward to each new release to help to shape me into a person who will reach out my hand when someone needs it. These books will enhance your life and your reading. I have read almost all of Ms Hyde's books and highly recommend all of them."}, {"userName": "Deanna ", "userReviewDate": "Feb 03, 2015", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/15662887-deanna", "userReview": "Fantastic Book!! Another great book by Catherine Ryan Hyde. I am very surprised that I didn't find this author long ago! I did see the movie \"Pay it Forward\" based on her book by the same name many years ago and loved it. When I came across this book and read the description I thought it sounded pretty good. However, it more than exceeded my expectations. I devoured it and since then I've been a huge fan. As I read her books I often find myself nodding along and agreeing with something a character is saying....about love or life or many other things. These characters got into my heart and I have no doubt this book will stay with me a very long time. I was moved to tears on a few occasions. The plot was fantastic as were the characters. I was gripped from the time I started until I finished the last page. I think it would also make a great movie!

I think I only finished this book because it was the only book I had with me several times. I have never read anything by this author but many of her works have crossed my path. People seem to like her.After finishing it, my thought are \"ugh\". Lowercase. I can't even give it an exclamatory \"Ugh!\" because the stupid book elicited almost zero feelings from me.Almost nothing happens at all. A man takes a couple of kids on a road trip to see many of America's national parks. The children are WAY too well behaved. The man is WAY too patient and reasonable.A huge chunk of the book consists of well mannered, thoughtful and very insightful conversation between the man and the older boy. About mostly nothing. There was not one single \"poopy\" and absolutely zero nose-picking humor. The man may as well have been traveling with other adults and not 7 and 12 year old boys. Well, they do fill a bunch of the drone with discussion of how to define an alcoholic. This was boring. It also felt sort of forced. Like, the author had her own idea on this and just wanted a platform with which to share it with the world. Much of this reading occurred while I was sipping my wine.I can't figure why so many people gave this book 5 shining stars. Almost nothing happened. It was long and preachy. It felt pathetically and screamingly unrealistic. It was boring.

But then I began to lose interest and the story lost a lot of its magic. I liked Seth, the 12-year-old, but once August begins his summer excursion with him and his little brother, Henry, Seth's conversation sometimes becomes unnatural (it didn't sound like a 12-year-old speaking) and repetitive. When Seth kept saying certain emotional things over and over again the words lost their meaning and Seth didn't come across as genuine. It seemed like the words' only purpose was to evoke pity or sympathy - they didn't add anything to the story nor move the plot forward. The children and their situation naturally demand readers' concern and sympathy - I can't comprehend how anyone with a heart wouldn't feel deeply for these children (and August), so the repetition only succeeded in distracting and distancing me from the story. I know it's petty, but the overuse of the sigh (the title should be, \"Take Me With You, and Sigh Every Step of the Way\") made me a little crazy, also. Is there truly no other way to describe a character's reaction to a frustrating or difficult situation?Despite being annoyed, I did stick with this book and read all of it. I admit to being a fan of Henry, the younger brother, who at 7 would go long periods of time without speaking at all. It was very satisfying when he takes a stand and speaks up for himself. I also understood the value of several other issues (how do you know when you're an alcoholic? how do you make a difference in a child's life when you're not a blood relative and the adult doesn't want you around? how do you stage an intervention, and what do you do if it doesn't work?) that were discussed rather well: I particularly liked what was said in one of the AA meetings, about if one goes around with a pillow trying to break others' falls, it might not be the great thing one thinks it is. Issues are handled with compassion and a strong dose of reality: It was nice to see how someone might deal with a problem that persists.Overall, there was some good stuff here, but (sigh), I struggled to get through it."}, {"userName": "Judy Collins", "userReviewDate": "Mar 29, 2014", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/11063006-judy-collins", "userReview": "A special thank you to Lake Union Publishing and NetGalley for introducing me to such a talented author, and providing an ARC in exchange for an honest review. Take Me With You was totally Amazing!! This is one of those rare books you will want to Pre-Order or purchase the day it is released. From the first page, this heartwarming story, grabs you and pulls you in, with a strong hold until the ending, and thereafter in your thoughts. My only issue was having to stop and finish work \u2013 and this is the type of book, you want to savor every word, as it will transform your life, as you cry and laugh with characters you learn to love and care for. My favorite part was learning to \u201cJust BE.\u201d We all are guilty of rushing to arrive at our destination and do not enjoy the journey, and the experience of the present time. This engaging story  begins with a guy named August (a former alcoholic) divorced, school teacher, still grieving his teenage son Philip who died in a car accident. Now he is taking his motorhome, alone for the summer to visit the national parks, hike, and scatter his son\u2019s ashes for his final goodbye. However, fate steps in when he has problems with his RV and calls a towing company (man named Wes, also an alcoholic raising two small boys). Little does August know, while he is awaiting the repair of his RV, in order to get back on the road, this connection with this man and these two small boys, will change the course of his life forever, as well as the lives and destiny of these two small boys (Seth and Henry). An unexpected twist of fate  lands August with two extra passengers for his journey, two half-orphans with nowhere else to go. This poignant novel reaches to the heart and soul with love, redemption, trust, transformation, and rediscovery, as the impact of this profound relationship will forever bond and shape the lives of two boys and a man, which nothing can break.There are so many takeaways  from this book, as would be ideal for book clubs or discussions. If you are a hiker, camper, or a nature lover you can appreciate this well researched book. If you are an alcoholic, a friend, parent, or family member involved, this book will give you much insight into the importance of support and mentors. (could see a sequel to followup with characters Seth and Henry, as they are too good to end)I was blown away by this newfound author,  Catherine Ryan Hyde,  with her incredible attention to detail with places, moods, facial expressions, and rich character development. After I finished the book, discovered she actually hikes, kayaks, and visits national parks, as well as doing her research for Take Me With You, in her own 22\u2019 motorhome. Wow, this made the book even more special, as her passion for nature is reflective throughout the book. As an avid hiker and cycler, I have traveled most of the places in the book and can definitely appreciate the beauty of mountain areas and waterfalls (even though I have never taken up rock climbing). I have even stayed at a few of the campground cabins along a bike trail, which is quite relaxing\u2014ah, this book was so for me. (I wanted to adopt these boys) and take a road trip. I highly recommend Take Me With You, as an inspiring, compelling, and heartfelt story which will change your life.

It started out okay - a teacher who hates teaching heads out on a national parks summer vacation in his RV. When the RV breaks down a jail bound mechanic offers to fix it for free if August - the teacher - will take his two boys with him for the summer while he does his stint in jail for yet another DUI. A bit unlikely, but okay. August is divorced following a tragic accident in which his teenage son, his only child, was killed while riding in the car with his buzzed mother. August never took another drink and started attending AA. So August and the two boys set off on a summer long national park adventure that goes predictably well until summer's end starts looming large on the horizon and the realization that the boys must return to jailbird/alcoholic dad sets in. From this point, the book degenerates into just too much self-pitying melodrama. The book is surprisingly emotionless considering how emotional everyone is. It had a very brittle feel. Everyone was always on edge, too much conflict, and no one ever seemed to grow or flourish. Even the ending - which, I believe, was meant to offer a glimmer or two of hope only depressed me. Maybe it was just too real for me."}, {"userName": "\u2728Susan\u2728", "userReviewDate": "Jun 16, 2015", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/21276121-susan", "userReview": "This was a nice story even though a little far fetched.

Written by the AMAZING by best selling author, Catherine Ryan Hyde! You probably know her best from her book (and movie), \"Pay It Forward\", a household phrase for doing good for others! That, she has done again! BRAVO! +Catherine Ryan Hyde ! BRAVO! She truly understands and knows the true spirit of humanity! She nails it every time in the countless novels she has written. There is no romance in this book, so if you're looking for that you'll have to find another book, but if you are looking for love, you've hit the nail on the head in this one. Love between strangers.In this story, we have a truly burned-out teacher, August, who is out of school from teaching, for the summer. Maybe a better way to describe August would be to say in addition to being burned-out as a teacher, perhaps he is also 'still grieving' for his own young son who was killed in an automobile accident several years ago, and for his wife who suddenly left him. In tragedies such as these, it is often hard on a couple, and sometimes they split like these two did. When it rains, it pours, and this poor man has had a downpour. Now, this summer his one single goal is to go to Yosemite Park in his RV, (he often refers to it as his rig) and his dog, Woody, to release some of his son's ashes there in the park in certain areas as he had promised his son they would be going there together that summer. Unfortunately, that summer never came for that family, but now August was on his way with the ashes at least, to spread them out in several places in Yosemite. Easier said than done because now his 'rig', as he refers to it, breaks down along the way. He has no choice but to stop and get it fixed, so he does. While his rig is being fixed, he the mechanic befriends August, he seems to be getting friendly towards him. Once he is ready to hit the road again, the mechanic, Wes, asks August a question. He has to do jail time for three months, over the summer. Would August mind taking his two sons with him while he serves his time? You can imagine how August feels. He is full of questions and is in disbelief that this mechanic, a stranger really, is asking him to take his two children on his vacation with him while he serves time in jail? This guy hardly knows him! August questions Wes some more. It's up to August to decide whether or not to do this. August agrees. Now August has two young boys to care for. Henry, 7, and Seth, 12. Off they go heading towards Yosemite. August is going to make this the best summer vacation for these boys possible, however, it takes a while for the boys to warm up to him, and Henry won't even talk to anyone. He only communicates with his brother, but that's all. Somehow something comes up when Seth says something about his Dad having to be in jail for six months, not just three. August is going out of his mind imagining . They have the phone number to the jail, they call Wes, but August can't ever get a clear answer out of him. August feels the need to go to a meeting one night. The boys don't understand. Is this a work meeting, and how would his work know where he was? They had a ton of questions for him. Finally August fesses up to the boys that he goes to AA meetings. No, not AAA, that's auto insurance. August goes to AA meetings - Alcoholics Anonymous meetings. So starts August's story. August figures out Wes is an alcoholic and now Seth wants to go to meetings with August, Open meetings because he realizes just how much of an alcoholic his father really is, that is until he can get to Alanon meetings. Would Wes let him go?Everything has spiraled. One things leads to another, but the one constant thing is August falls in love with these boys, or is it the other way around? Do the boys fall in love with August? It doesn't matter who it is who falls in love with who, it just happens.Years later, the boys, now ages 15 and 20, come to take August out on a trip in the same RV, without their father's (Wes') knowledge, and it turns out to be quite a trip! Augusts' health has taken a turn for the worse, but the boys don't care, they help August, and he was in heaven that the boys did this for him in reciprocation! The drama picks back up again after all these years once Wes finds out the boys took August on this trip that just the boys were supposed to be on. They are good boys, with kind, gentle, loving hearts. The one who has no heart is the one with all of the problems, or causes all of the problems. Wes. Alcohol, alcohol, alcohol. Look at the problems it can cause, or, solutions to the problems such as in this story.This is only a very small look into this story, but it is one that will stay with you forever.

Her books are well written, that is a given, and they make you care. You just care. I simply love that. She reminds me a bit of Kent Haruf in that way. Her books are not about romance and that is such a relief. Hyde\u2019s books have a way of focusing on our social environment, and maybe a bit more on how children of our era are embraced, loved, influenced, educated by other people then their biological parents.Here, in \u201cTake Me With You\u201d, an average guy, August Schroeder, father to a deceased teenager has motor problems on his way to his Summer road trip. So August stops at an auto-repair shop where the owner, Owen, makes him the offer to take his two boys, Seth and Henry, on this road trip for free repair of his rig, while Owen has to sit out a 3-months jail sentence.From there, we witness a difficult and hesitant, but unique friendship blossom between August and the boys.I loved this book for its simplicity and sincerity.The audio version was something I had to warm up to, but in the end, I thought that Jeff Cummings did a great job."}, {"userName": "Dorine", "userReviewDate": "Jun 12, 2017", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/6942470-dorine", "userReview": "TAKE ME WITH YOU by Catherine Ryan Hyde is an entertaining coming-of-age, adventure novel full of family values and addiction awareness. It hit one of my favorite tropes, which is \u201ctravel challenges\u201d. I didn\u2019t expect it to be mostly from the male point-of-view, but it was an agreeable difference.It\u2019s TBR Challenge day with Wendy the Super Librarian and time for me to visit the other challenge participants. I love doing this every month! There are a couple of pictures from my trip to Yellowstone on my blog. Join the conversation and give me suggestions on the \"travel\" trope at The Zest Quest.Why was this in Dorine\u2019s TBR? I\u2019m drawn to travel stories. We love to camp, and RVing across country is something I\u2019ve always wanted to do. The mention of Yellowstone in the blurb grabbed me.My favorite trope may seem odd, but I\u2019ve read several books during the last two years that use travel challenges as a plot device, which in turn shows the characters\u2019 growth by how they handle them. Travel is one of the themes on my blog because I love the idea of gradually writing about our own travel adventures. This novel just kept getting better as I read, because the outdoor challenges became more important as the story progressed. That also added appeal to the second part of the novel when I grew wary of where it was going.I read romance or women\u2019s fiction as the bulk of my fiction, but I also enjoy coming-of-age stories. What intrigued me most about this book is its male point-of-view with a lack of female protagonists. There were a couple female cameo appearances, but this is significantly about father/son relationships. Not romantic in any way, it\u2019s more about the love of family \u2013 related by blood or adopted through friendship.Science teacher August Schroeder takes his motorhome across country every summer. He budgets for gas and expenses for those months. He\u2019s very excited about this year\u2019s trip as well as a bit melancholy about not sharing it with his favorite person. Naturally, August is extremely disappointed when his RV breaks down. The local mechanic, Wes, understands August\u2019s desire to continue his trip, but the repair costs will probably end his dream. Wes also has a dilemma. Can they come to an agreement that satisfies both parties?August can\u2019t believe Wes asks him to take his sons with him. Wes has a couple days to find his kids a place to live while he serves a jail sentence until September. Wes wants his boys to have an adventure instead of landing in foster care. Seth is the oldest and can take care of his younger brother Henry. August is a teacher, so he seems like a reliable choice. Not that Wes has an alternative if August refuses. Lucky for Wes and the two boys, August accepts. How can he refuse? His dog Woody loves the idea.That\u2019s just the first three chapters but there\u2019s a lot more to this story. August has issues that reflect what the boys face with their dad. But August handles his issues in a more mature manner, which in turn teaches the boys how to live. Where the novel goes after Wes is released from jail is a complete surprise. That\u2019s all I\u2019m going to say so I don\u2019t spoil it for you.There were times when I doubted the dialogue. It\u2019s not always believable. Seth can be a bit pretentious and cloying for a twelve-year-old boy. Since I liked the story and characters, I could ignore the hiccups. Seth and Henry are engaging kids and I couldn\u2019t help but feel deeply for their situation. They bring the best out of August and help him cope with something that has been holding him back from enjoying his life. As a step-mom of two boys (now grown men), I could easily relate to Seth and Henry. They teach August as much as August teaches them, which makes their daily jaunts engaging.I loved following their journey and wish this book was longer. That surprises me because I\u2019m usually drawn to novels less than 300 pages. At 351 pages, I wanted more time RVing. The places they traveled made me anxious to go there. The locations I\u2019ve experienced first-hand were fun to revisit, as well as accurately described.One of the things I really enjoyed were the chapter titles. For example, \u201cAugust, Standing Still\u201d was the first chapter where August\u2019s RV breaks down. Chapter two is \u201cThis will sound crazy\u201d which is where Wes tells August what he wants from him. Each chapter gives a hint to what\u2019s significant about it. It was fun to try to guess what will happen next based on the chapter title.Catherine Ryan Hyde is best known for her book, PAY IT FORWARD, a philosophy I admire. The cover for LEAVING BLYTHE RIVER is how I discovered this author, which is another book I reviewed on my blog if you\u2019re interested.If you love books that highlight travel, then you\u2019ll enjoy TAKE ME WITH YOU. I especially enjoyed the boys and how August becomes a catalyst for their future. TAKE ME WITH YOU is good family drama featuring imperfect characters with huge hearts. I\u2019m anxious to find my next Catherine Ryan Hyde novel to add to my collection.Review by Dorine, courtesy of The Zest Quest.

When his motorhome needs repairing, he takes it in to be fixed but comes away with two additional passengers, Seth and Henry. They need somewhere to stay over the summer, and someone to care for them. As they travel from place to place, a friendship begins to build, and eight years later, on a road trip of a slightly different nature, the true bond is revealed.A stunningly beautiful and heartwarming story 'Take Me With You' is about friendships, and the effect a positive influence can have on someone's life. I instantly loved August's character. While suffering inner torment over the death of his son, he was still able to find room in his heart to care for two strangers, who, in turn, end up caring for him. Seth and Henry, experiencing their own troubles due to their situation at home, were movingly penned. Hyde's scenery descriptions were breathtaking, and the emotional ending left a lump lodged in my throat!

It is a fortuitous trip for both August and the boys, and it changes them in ways they cannot anticipate. They all need saving, and they save each other, and it is the building of their relationships and the influences they exert upon one another that make this a poignant and meaningful story.This is my second Hyde book and I liked this one even more than the first. Hyde has a way of telling a story that makes you just relax into it and go along on the journey. You feel that you are always moving toward something important, something that matters not only to the characters but to all of us.
