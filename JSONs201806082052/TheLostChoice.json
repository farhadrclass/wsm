It gave me a lot to think about. I liked the approach of learning from the lives and contributions of great people. I felt a desire to learn more about each of the characters in history who were incorporated into this novel. George Washington Carver, Booker T Washington, William Wallace and others. What counsel and advice would those individuals provide to us today? That is a question worth thinking about.More than anything I loved the concept of this story . . . that every one of us have the opportunity and obligation to make a difference in the world. We make that difference by making a choice. One of my favorite passages from this novel reads as follows: \u201cEverybody \u2013 every single body \u2013 makes a difference! But there is a choice that determines what kinda difference you will make. Most folks don't see how important they are . . . how much tey matter to all of us. So they never choose to do somethin' special wif' their lives. And not makin' a choice? Tha is a choice . . . a lost one.\u201dAnother one of my favorite passage comes from the section with George Washington Carver. In that section he talks the impact our choices have on the world. \u201cI am convinced \u2013 that every choice one makes and every action one takes, or doesn't take, significantly affects the lives of everyone else. We are all connected to each other through our actions. Our decisions to act or not to act, to help or not to help\u2014well, those choices create a ripple effect that can last for centuries.\u201d The character then goes on to talk about the multitude of people who perhaps contribute to a world changing invention and poses the question, \u201cTo whom do we owe the debt of gratitude for enriching our lives significantly with that invention?\u201d The inventor? The author of book which may have inspired the inventor? The teacher who inspired the author of the book? The creator of a scholarship fund? A doctor who delivered one of these people? Or perhaps the man who drove the wagon delivering the lumber which built the doctor's office where one of these men or women were born. I love the message, \u201cWE ALL HAVE SOMETHING TO CONTRIBUTE!!!\u201d"}, {"userName": "Angela", "userReviewDate": "Jan 20, 2011", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/2522971-angela", "userReview": "I didn't think I would like this book because the beginning started out a little cheesy. A little cheese is okay every now and then, especially if the book has a good message. The moral of the story is that everyone on the planet has the potential for greatness. It is up to us to choose to act and live up to our potential. There are a few really great quotes from the book \"The Lord always provides me with changing ideas. Not that I am special. The Lord provides everyone with life-changing ideas. These ideas are quite literally a treasure map from the Almighty. It is up to each of us, however, to choose to dig for the treasure. Every man and woman on the planet contains within them the power to change the world, but this power is only manifested when one makes a conscious choice to use it.\" (pg.89)\"There are those who would say, 'Let us be patient. Let us sit and wait upon the Almighty.' I say to them, 'Get up! The Almighty is waiting on you!' Make no mistake, the Lord God instructs us; He leads us and inspires us, but He expects us to do something with the gifts we've been given. It is a choice that too few make.\" (pg. 145)"}, {"userName": "Lisa", "userReviewDate": "Jun 01, 2013", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/2316041-lisa", "userReview": "I believe that this book was a YA...however, I loved it! I loved the message that it gave and how it was given (through the past and present). It reminded me of Paul Coelho's, THE ALCHEMIST, in that it was a very positive and uplifting lesson to life. You know if I read a book in one day, all the way through, that I really, really enjoyed it! That is not to say that others will or will not. This is just my preference in a book, and at this particular time in my life...what I really needed right now. Saying that, I do believe that every young adult will get a little bit of history with fiction with a learning lesson and should most absolutely read this book~ ironically I received it from a teacher friend of mine. So if you are looking for a little bit of happiness and a way to connect with our human race...make sure that you check your choices because they impact EVERYONE!

You get a solid historical fiction book by Andy Andrews, who is known for his love of biographies and his ability to extract inspirational life lessons from some of the most compelling lives throughout history.I find myself saying this a lot lately, but this story starts out slowly, and it takes a good 65-70 pages to get going. Stick with it. Because once it takes off, it is enthralling, with a storyline reminiscent of the adventures of Benjamin Franklin Gates in the National Treasure film series. In The Lost Choice, Andy Andrews\u2019 plot centers around three or four relics that have a very powerful meaning and have been handed down to some of the most influential lives of the past several hundred years. Among the biographies that Andrews brings to light are Joan of Arc, William Wallace, Booker T. Washington, Oskar Schindler, George Washington Carver, Thomas Jefferson, John Adams, and Alfred Vanderbilt.Although quite a diverse list of famous people, Andrews does a masterful job of grouping these people into three very distinct categories, each one represented by a relic that has supposedly been passed down from generation to generation throughout history. The four main characters in the story that chase down the relics and discover the legacy of each piece are, fittingly, a detective, a newspaper reporter, a museum curator, and an archaeologist.If you\u2019ve read Andy Andrews before, you are familiar with his style and his love of the biography. Once again, he spins a masterful tale that allows the reader to walk away with meaning and inspiration and a desire to apply what\u2019s been learned in order to make an impact on the world, one person at a time, a la the \u201cbutterfly effect\u201d that Andy writes about often. You\u2019ll enjoy this one."}, {"userName": "J.W.

But there is a choice that determines what kinda difference you will make. Most folks don't see how important they are... how much they matter to all of us. So they never choose to do somethin' special wif their lives. And not makin' a choice? That is a choice ... a lost one.\u201dAndy Andrews is a modern legend when it comes to storytelling. It has been said that the greatest story telling commandment is to make the audience care -- emotionally, intellectually, aesthetically. Andrews is able to do just that. His ability to recreate on the page the lives of influential men and women around the world draw in audiences to what end up being incredibly inspirational stories. There is no doubt that the works of this author ought to be taught unanimously in our schools today.In  The Lost Choice  Andrews reminds us that each person, no matter how seemingly insignificant they are has the ability to positively or negatively impact the people that surround them every day. More importantly, we are reminded that intentions do not turn into accomplishments. If we always intend to make a difference but never choose to make that difference then it is of little value. If only our society today could realize that we talk too much and act too little how much better off we would all be.Andrews relates this message in a beautifully crafted story that brings vivid characters to life and creates a mystery in the minds of his readers. This book is an instant classic for any lover of historical fiction, mystery, or inspirational stories."}, {"userName": "Teri", "userReviewDate": "Jan 28, 2018", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/2430258-teri", "userReview": "I think this book was the most different I've ever read. I began reading it with the expectation it would be like all other books - that the story line would follow along from beginning to end. Well, it kinda does, and it kinda doesn't. I'll put it this way: the interesting story line runs like a thread throughout the book, but it is interspersed by \"vignettes\" of historical accounts, real ones from what i could tell through my research online, of people like Booker T. Washington, Napoleon, the Founding Fathers, Abraham Lincoln, Thomas Jefferson, George Washington Carver, etc. I won't spoil the book and tell you what they all had in common. The story line is what ties all the \"vignettes\" of these historical figures together. It was very fun and interesting to read. However, I strongly disliked the ending. The story never \"wrapped up\". So it's like you reach what could potentially be the climax of the book, only to find it just ends. Just like that. no ending to the story. However, I will say that that may be part of the whole experience. To just never know. I will say this too: it left it wide open for a sequel. As another author, Richard Paul Evans, does, this author drops a lot of golden nuggets of wisdom in his book. Many times I wanted to stop the audio and jot down a quote, and many times I did. I love books (and other media) that leave me thinking or enrich my thinking and life in some way. This book did not disappoint. It's a good read.

For ultimately, no person can ever rise beyond the restrictions of his own character.\"\"The world cares very little about what a person knows. It's what a person does with what he knows that counts.\" (Booker T. Washington)\"I have learned that success is to be measured not so much by the position that one has reached in life as by the obstacles he has overcome while choosing to succeed.

Although they have a common theme of achieving one's purpose and greatness, the plots are entirely different. This one revolves around a relic that is supposed to be a catalyst, or rather an inspiration, for a butterfly effect. Of course, this is a work of fiction but I really loved how the author incorporated some great people from history (such as Oskar Schindler, Henry Wallace, Joan of Arc, George Carver, Alfred Vanderbilt, Queen Elizabeth I, John Adams, Thomas Jefferson) into the story and how the relic played its part in their quest of serving mankind.
