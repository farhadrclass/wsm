The interviewers range from upcoming writers (at the time\u2014this is from 2005) such as ZZ Packer and Adam Thirlwell to well-known names like Zadie Smith and Dave Eggers. The interviewees are eclectic, spanning generations and writing subcultures, from oldies like James Salter and Shirley Hazzard to punks like Felicia Luna and George Saunders. The content varies depending on one\u2019s personal opinion of the writer or reaction to their answers (or questions). The dreariest material in here is caused by the interviewer quizzing the writer on what MFA programme they attended and which part of LA or New York they relocated to. The most illuminating comes from direct questions about the oeuvre and method\u2014highlights for me include Stoppard, McEwen, Didion (despite cringing Eggers moments), Edward P. Jones, and Banville. The absence of experimental writers or figures outside the mainstream can be blamed on McSweeney\u2019s tendency to grope for commercial populism while pretending to have a foot in the avant-cools. Alas, alas."}, {"userName": "Jeff Bursey", "userReviewDate": "Apr 20, 2014", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/901028-jeff-bursey", "userReview": "From The Review of Contemporary Fiction, Spring 2006, Vol. XXVI, No. 1, pp. 153-154Donna Seaman. Writers on the Air: Conversations about Books. Paul Dry Books. 2005. 467 pp. $24.95. Vendela Vida. The Believer Book of Writers Talking to Writers. Believer Books, 2005. 485 pp. Paper: $18.00.When a writer is interviewed, there\u2019s often the risk that he or she will come off like an idiot or inadvertently gut their work of significance. Neither of those things is avoided in the books under review, but the self-embarrassment is minimal.The first title collects thirty-two interviews ably conducted by Donna Seaman and drawn from her radio program Open Books. A gentle and skilled interrogator, she clearly does her own research. Margaret Atwood\u2019s self-congratulation leaps off the page, while Peter Carey takes the questions, broadens them, and courteously involves Seaman in the process. Philip Lopate preens, while Diane Ackerman infectiously enthuses. Aleksandar Hemon is unfettered: \u201cNonfiction is for cowards\u201d puts things clearly, contrasting with Lee Gutkind making a case for creative nonfiction and Ward Just arguing that journalism is the best way to \u201cget into the way of life.\u201d Such contrasts enrich the book. T.C. Boyle\u2019s views on the decline of the environment are counter-balanced by Wade Davis and Sy Montgomery. First-time novelists understandably speak on more narrow topics, but Seaman respects each guest\u2019s contribution. Such is the power of radio that it can throw a veil over all disfigurements, despite its apparent intimacy. Unfortunately, the editing methodology behind the transposition of the spoken word to the page so as to \u201cconform to print conventions\u201d and make the interviews easier reading is not revealed.\tThe mediums in Vendela Vida\u2019s Believer book include regular mail, e-mail, telephone, fax and in-person interviews. Each subject was chosen because someone said, \u201c\u2018I\u2019d like to have a conversation with __.\u2019\u201d The results show that a national broadcast can cow those who are intrepid in print. Edward P. Jones opens up to Z.Z. Packer more than he did with Seaman. Since interrogator and subject know each other, the interplay between Zadie Smith and Ian McEwan, Adam Thirlwell and Tom Stoppard, Dave Eggers and Joan Didion, or, especially, Ben Marcus and George Saunders, display humour and a performance aspect which are often missing from pronouncements on what the role of the artist is in today\u2019s world. Jonathan Lethem and Thisbe Nisse ask questions that are more insightful than the answers Paul Auster and Siri Hustvedt supply. When Janet Malcolm gets \u201call huffy\u201d over a vexing topic, she analyses her reaction for the benefit of Daphne Beal, and concludes: \u201ceven journalists are not immune to the vanity and self-deception that interviews bring out in their subjects and that journalists, like novelists, lie in wait for.\u201d Readers of these books will come to their own conclusions on how the subjects accidentally reveal or hide themselves. Vida and Seaman have compiled entertaining and valuable sources for further examination of new and familiar authors."}, {"userName": "Patrick McCoy", "userReviewDate": "Sep 22, 2011", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/678506-patrick-mccoy", "userReview": "I really found The Believer Book Of Writers Talking To Writers edited by Vendela Vida useful, interesting, and entertaining. The main reason I picked up this collection is that it contained interviews with some of my favorite contemporary writers like Tobias Wolff, Joan, Didion, Haruki Murakami, Ian McEwen, August Wilson, Marilynne Robinson, Marajane Satrapi, and Edward P. Jones. In fact, in Jones case I knew almost nothing about this writer with an underprivileged background who wrote the impressive American epic about blacks owning slaves in The Known World. There were other interviews with authors I had know and have read, but are not among my favorites like Paul Auster, Tom Stoppard, and George Saunders. Then there were writers who I knew by reputation but was interested to know more about what they are about in order to build interest to read their work with writers like Grace Paley, Orhan Pamuk, and Amy Hempel. Then there were authors that I discovered that weren\u2019t for me due to descriptions of their work in the interviews with writers like John Banville, Richard Powers, and Edmund White. Then there were some authors that were total revelations to me, writers I was completely unfamiliar with like Chris Abani, Shirley Hazzard, Jennifer Egan, and Janet Malcom."}, {"userName": "Ryan", "userReviewDate": "May 31, 2015", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/1959481-ryan", "userReview": "I was planning on giving this book a 3 leaning towards 3.5, but it finished strong. I think a thought from Tobias Wolff illustrates the book's strength: it provides some access to a community of writers.

The interviews include favorites gleaned from the pages of the Believer magazine along with previously unpublished conversations. The book is rife with astonishing insights and profound quips. To wit:George Saunders: \u2018I see writing as part of an ongoing attempt to really, viscerally, believe that everything matters, suffering is real, and death is imminent.\u2019Ian McEwan: \u2018The dream, surely, that we all have, is to write this beautiful paragraph that actually is describing something but at the same time in another voice is writing commentary on its own creation, without having to be a story about a writer.\u2019Jamaica Kincaid: \u2018All of these declarations of what writing ought to be, which I had myself\u2014though, thank god I had never committed them to paper\u2014I think are nonsense.... You write what you write, and then either it holds up or it doesn't hold up. There are no rules or particular sensibilities. I don't believe in that all anymore.\u2019Janet Malcolm: \u2018The narrator of my nonfiction pieces is not the same person I am\u2014she is a lot more articulate and thinks of much cleverer things to say than I usually do.\u2019Paul Auster: \u2018In my own case, I certainly don't walk into my room and sit down at my desk feeling like a boxer ready to go ten rounds with Joe Louis. I tiptoe in. I procrastinate. I delay. I come in sideways, kind of sliding through the door.... I don't burst into the saloon with my six-shooter ready. If I did, I'd probably shoot myself in the foot.\u2019Tobias Wolff: \u2018Each time out should be a swing for the fences. Don't do base-running drills.
