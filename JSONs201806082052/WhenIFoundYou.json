Nathan was the type of surrogate parent every professional in my field looks for when placing abused and neglected children. I applaud the author's insight in understanding the loss and grief process children such as Nat experience and the unconditional support their caregivers must provide. The message to be truthful with children about their past and not to create stories they will ultimately learn are false is one that is paramount in securing the trust foster and adoptive children needed to heal. This novel also touched a bit on some of the struggles adoptive parents encounter such as the emotional walls Eleanor build to keep Nat out and the affect this had on her marriage. I gave this novel 4 stars vs 5 simply because it left me questioning the development and demise of Nat and his wife's relationship. I would strongly suggest this book for foster and adoptive parents."}, {"userName": "Penelope", "userReviewDate": "Jul 25, 2013", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/7422995-penelope", "userReview": "I was expecting quite a lot from this book, so I was extremely disappointed with what I got. Hyde's writing is minimalist but emotionless (at least the majority of the time); books often bring me to tears but I could not even feel a twang in my heart. I love the minimalist style, but part of minimalism is not just saying few things and describing little; it's using as few words as necessary to pack a punch. It's meant to be like a 5 Hour Energy vs a Rockstar. The pace of this novel is rapid; by the time I was digesting the fact that the baby had been found, he was already a juvenile delinquent. This means that important plot strings are picked up then dropped, and given no depth. Nat's relationship with Carol is meant to be deep and full of devotion, but we see her maybe twice before they're married. Their relationship does not grow within the novel, which would have added an extra layer to the story. They meet then they're married, which seems absurdly unlikely for someone who was sprung out of juvie two days prior and never had the chance to flirt with girls.I found the novel's depiction of women to be repugnant; all three of the women who feature as wives are nothing more than dutiful wives acting as extensions of their husbands. They're pure and faithful (even Nathan's first wife, Flora, who I solidly disliked). Carol has no reason to exist other than for her husband and raises no objection even when he doesn't talk to her for nine years. She never sees anybody else. Flora and Eleanor both disappear from the story the moment they disappear from their husband's lives. (Well, granted, Flora died, but come on.) They are always somehow able to make beautiful, delicious meals for the table. Despite having four important female figures, none of them ever talk to each other or form a relationship. Three of them are extremely unlikeable. The only one who seems to have a kind heart is Carol, who is conveniently also a devout Christian who saved herself for marriage, adding a whole other layer of bad taste.The only characters in the stories who seem to have real flaws are Nat, Eleanor, Flora, and Ertha. Everyone else seems to be living in some heightened state of awareness, even Manny, who allows Nat to skip out on his job. The character of Jack comes in as a major driving force in the story then disappears several chapters later; tantalizing hints are dropped about Jack and Nat's mother and father, but we never learn about them, leading to a keen sense of disappointment.One other thing I would like to touch on briefly is Hyde's depictions of people of color; they are almost invariably colored with stereotypes in language or in behavior. Which is really kinda uncool.All in all, I'm glad it only cost 99 cents; I have never read a book that frustrated me so much. I've never before rated a book one star, actually; the only thing that seems to redeem this is its basic plot."}, {"userName": "Suzanne", "userReviewDate": "Feb 21, 2014", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/11889829-suzanne", "userReview": "I loved this book, following the lives of young Nat, who was abandoned at birth, and his 'rescuer' Nathan. The story mostly follows the relationship between these two, it was interesting watching the building maturity of Nat, and the way he grows up, finding his way in the world and how he cares for his saviour. The back story was boxing, a sport that has never interested me but was crucial to the storyline. I've read a couple of books lately where the characters have been such nice people, and this is one of them, you build a repore ~ it makes you feel like you're gunning for them and want the best for all involved. Written well, and easy to read while I have the distraction of school holidays and extra kids around, and all the other distractions that always seem to come my way. Highly recommended, a lovely book with beautiful characters and a very special relationship. The first of this author for me, and I have 'Pay it Forward' to look forward to."}, {"userName": "John", "userReviewDate": "Apr 24, 2012", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/6261753-john", "userReview": "When I Found You: a masterpiece of human emotion...Just read this short paragraph, let the words sink in, then close your eyes and visualize what you've read:\"Nathan McCann stood in his dark kitchen, a good two hours before dawn. He flipped on the overhead light, halfway hoping to see the coffeemaker all set up with water and grounds and waiting to be plugged in and set to percolating. Instead he saw the filter basket lying empty in the dish drain, looking abandoned and bare.\"Sometimes when we read an opening passage in a book, the words fit together so well, so perfectly crafted, that it creates an indelible image that sticks with us. This is the case with Catherine Ryan Hyde's When I Found You, a stunningly moving story of honesty, faith, perseverance and the human spirit.Nathan McCann was a middle-aged man, married but without no children. While out hunting with his dog, he found a newborn infant in the woods, and assumed that the child was dead. But when the baby moved, Nathan's existence was changed completely, and that event became the beginning of a chain of events that span a lifetime.Nathan took the baby to the hospital, quite taken by this small life that he had found. He wanted to adopt the boy, but the child's maternal grandmother claimed it. Nathan couldn't forget him, so he visited the child's grandmother and gave her a request: that when the boy was old enough, that he was to be told the truth. The grandmother gave her word that at some point she would introduce the boy to 'the man who found you in the woods.'The boy was named Nat in honor of Nathan, and for the next fifteen years lived with his grandmother. Nathan watched the boy from a distance, not involved in his life, and sent birthday and Christmas gifts. Because she wanted to protect him, the grandmother chose to not to tell Nat that his own mother abandoned him. Her reluctance to be truthful with him caused problems, and he began to grow into being a troubled young man. His misbehavior resulted in the grandmother taking Nat to Nathan to raise, as she could no longer deal with him.The appearance of Nat into Nathan's life brought frequent turmoil and battles. Nat was an angry young man, seemingly angry at everything in the world; Nathan was a man of principles, believing in always telling the truth. The tumultuous relationship between a father and son who are not blood relatives had some profound effects on both of them and the others in their lives. Yet this story, spanning a period of about thirty years, will surprise the reader with it's range of human emotion and how bonds can be strained yet not broken.There are many books that can touch ones emotions and tug at the heartstrings. But there are few that are as well written, that can delve so deeply into how one tiny moment can be the catalyst of lifetime of events, of how one flash of faith can set off an amazing chain of human emotions that can be so profoundly moving. It's a tale of unconditional love and unwavering faith that few can match.Author Catherine Ryan Hyde has a way of writing, of putting her words together, that makes us visualize as we read her words. Her earlier work, Pay It Forward, resulted in not just the highly acclaimed film of the same name, but a worldwide movement that continues to grow to this day. As a personal note, that book had been my favorite of all her works until I read When I Found You, and now I have two... different books in all respects, yet with a common bond in dealing with perseverance, human emotion and spirit.Note: This review originally appeared on Amazon.com, and can be seen here: \u2022 Review of When I Found YouBooks by Catherine Ryan Hyde referenced here:\u2022 When I Found You\u2022 Pay It Forward5/4/2012"}, {"userName": "Rick", "userReviewDate": "Feb 01, 2014", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/1019632-rick", "userReview": "Five tear-stained stars.

Surprise when I found a heart wrenching, heart warming and touching book with men as the main characters. Well crafted and believable these were men that the I found myself rooting for.  Every young man, full of a difficult past and yearning for something should have a man such as Nathan in their life. Firm, yet kind and quieting, Nathan was yearning for something of his own to give his rather dull life meaning. He found it and more when he takes on Nat, and never quits on him. His take on the right and wrong ways to live a life was refreshing....and his belief in Nat did not fail him in the end. Strong, well developed characters, and an easy writing style will have me returning to Ms. Hyde's work in the future.A solid 4 star book!"}, {"userName": "Pam", "userReviewDate": "Apr 29, 2012", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/2426793-pam", "userReview": "I probably would have rated this book higher if the last half wasn't a disappointment for not living up to the promise of the first half. It's an interesting premise for a story--a man finds an abandoned newborn early one morning when he's hunting in the woods. He actually wants to raise the child, but the infant's family is found and the baby is raised by his grandmother. The man keeps tabs on the boy throughout his young life but does not personally interact with him. The boy is troubled and when his grandmother delivers him in desperation to the man (rather than giving him up to the state), the man's determination to support the troubled teen kicks into high gear. The story of their evolving relationship and the boy's movement from adolescence into adulthood is the rest of the story.Hyde's writing is eloquent and evocative (\"The sensation was similar to that of dropping a heavy object into a bottomless well, and then waiting for it to make a sound. The news made no sound.\")in the first third of the book. Then the plot becomes somewhat improbable. The main character (the man who found the infant) is almost saintlike in his determination to provide the home and anchor the boy always needed, but didn't really receive (the grandmother is not the bad guy--just ill equipped for parenting). The rich use of language (\"One new thing to accept, that was difficult and exhilarating and stressful and wonderful enough. But kindergarten and a baby bird was almost too much. Like something in his chest might burst, and then that would be the end of him.\")is sacrificed for the unlikely narrative."}, {"userName": "R * A Reader Obsessed *", "userReviewDate": "Feb 12, 2016", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/21987508-r-a-reader-obsessed", "userReview": "I get it. I really do. The take home message here is that unconditional love is a powerful thing. It gives confidence and drive and a sense of self worth. The infallibility of Nathan who does so was the best part of this book - albeit frustrating. Nathan finds an abandoned baby and proclaims that no matter what, he will always be there for that child - and he surely delivers over and over as the boy Nat grows up and makes mistakes like you wouldn't believe.And perhaps that is the message. People fuck up. And there will come a time when those people will alienate their friends and family... or in Nathan's case, not. The author is supposedly known for her other book Pay It Forward which promotes said powerful message - a tenet that is touched upon here. Nat finally redeems himself, finally gets it - but for me it was pretty much too little, too late."}, {"userName": "Therese", "userReviewDate": "Mar 08, 2012", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/3428240-therese", "userReview": "You get what you pay for is believed to be true by many, including me, but I know there are exceptions to every saying and every rule, or so it seems, and this is definitely one of them.As you can see I got this book for free, but it was worth so much more than that. I first came across When I Found You in another short story collection by Catherine Ryan Hyde and it grabbed me so much I was just about ready to go ask her where the rest of the story was. At the end of that short story collection I was told that it had grown into a full-length novel. Thank goodness!Nathan McCann was out hunting with his dog, Sadie, early one morning when he found a baby wrapped in an over-sized sweater and a small little cap. He didn't even think the baby was alive, but when he realized it was, he quickly took him to the hospital and knew that his life would never be the same. He wanted to adopt this little baby even though his wife thought he was out of his mind.It was touch and go for the little baby, but they finally found the mother, arrested her, and put the baby in the care of his maternal grandmother. Nathan had to know what happened and so he looked her up and let her know that he wanted this baby. Of course she thought he was nuts, but she agreed to keep him posted on baby Nat, who was named Nathan after him.Fast forward several years and grandma can't take any more of Nat, and so she shows up on Nathan's door wondering whether he still wants to be a part of this boy's life like he said because she is washing her hands of him, something Nathan will never do.I am surprised by how many of the reviews are negative and don't believe that a man can be this good, honest, and steadfast, but I have been blessed to know two people like this, including my father.This is a touching story and I know I will not forget Nathan McCann and Nat Bates for a very long time, if ever. I didn't know how the author would end their story, but it turned out to be just right although I'm really glad I had some Kleenex nearby."}, {"userName": "Debbie", "userReviewDate": "Aug 01, 2013", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/8665845-debbie", "userReview": "This is my second Hyde book (I read \u201cWalk Me Home\u201d not long ago). Like the first, \u201cWhen I Found You\u201d is a great story--well-written, straightforward, and with the right amount of drama to hold my interest. A man finds a newborn in the woods and makes sure his life is intertwined with the boy he has saved. With skill, the author explores all the permutations of passion, love, trust, and honesty. The plot has a good pace and the characters are well-developed and likeable. Hyde also wrote \u201cPay It Forward,\u201d which was made into a movie. \u201cWhen I Found You\" touches on the same theme as \u201cPay It Forward\u201d: when something good happens to you, you don\u2019t \u201cpay it back\u201d but instead you \u201cpay it forward\u201d to the next person. The fact that she uses the same theme in at least two books is interesting yet a bit annoying. One theme in two books? Can\u2019t the author come up with different themes? And the theme is so goody two-shoes; almost too Hallmark-y for me.Another problem is that the story is written very simplistically, and at times I wanted something more sophisticated. I know she writes a lot of YA books, so that\u2019s probably the reason for the simple style. I couldn\u2019t help feeling like I was reading at a sixth-grade level. Also, both of the books I read by Hyde are really wholesome, which left me craving an edgier read.There\u2019s one small editing mistake\u2014the author reveals a secret in two separate chapters. At second mention, the character claims not to have heard it before, and the secret teller agrees he hadn\u2019t mentioned it earlier. It\u2019s a super minor point, but it bugged me.However, as I said, the story is a good one and I was invested. I rate it a strong 3.5."}, {"userName": "Aidan Bizony", "userReviewDate": "May 14, 2011", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/5279053-aidan-bizony", "userReview": "BRILLIANT! BRILLIANT!

Ho letto spesso romanzi su giovani difficili, e li ho altrettanto spesso trovati non di mio gusto, per l'eccesso che tendono a mettere nelle azioni del giovane, nella giustificazione delle sue azioni, e nel finale sempre miracoloso.In questo romanzo non ci sono eccessi: il dolore \u00e8 visto formarsi e crescere e non \u00e8 mai sbandierato, ma sempre lasciato in sottofondo, come un compagno che tutti dobbiamo accettare nella vita; e, cosa meravigliosa e terribile insieme, il dolore non \u00e8 giustificato perch\u00e9 non \u00e8 motivato. Non c'\u00e8 un perch\u00e9, per quello che accade al piccolo Nat, non c'\u00e8 un perch\u00e9, per quello che fa il grande Nathan. Ci sono solo le risposte che il lettore deve darsi da solo, conoscendo pian piano i personaggi, non attraverso l'introspezione - sono rarissimi i momenti in cui i pensieri dei personaggi emergono -, ma attraverso l'osservazione. Come facciamo insomma tutti i giorni della nostra vita, quando dobbiamo capire gli altri per come si mostrano a noi, quando dobbiamo capire noi stessi per come ci mostriamo agli altri, e quando dobbiamo accettare che a volte non ci \u00e8 dato capire.Il miracolo, poi, \u00e8 del tutto assente o, a seconda di come lo si vede, sempre presente: i drammi non si risolvono con un po' di amore e polvere magica, anzi, possono pure portare altri drammi; ma \u00e8 Nathan il vecchio che \u00e8 forse tutto un miracolo, in un modo cos\u00ec umano che non si pu\u00f2 trovarlo meno che credibile, e in un modo cos\u00ec sovrumano che non si pu\u00f2 non cercarlo intorno a noi e dentro di noi, come poi fanno coloro che gli gravitano attorno. Nella spiegazione che lui d\u00e0 al suo stegno continuo al piccolo Nat, forse, \u00e8 il senso di tutto il libro: Nathan sente di non aver fatto nient'altro di straordinario nella sua vita, se non quanto legato a Nat. E allora lo rende straordinario, da quando lo salva da morte certa, a quando lo segue di nascosto nella sua crescita, fino a quando se lo ritrova, smarrito e delinquente, alla porta di casa sua, e anche allora gli dona il suo affetto, che \u00e8 davvero straordinario. Non \u00e8 un affetto urlato, non ci sono sentimenti manifesti o sbraitati in questo libro: c'\u00e8 un amore silenzioso e pacato, come \u00e8 pacato Nathan, come impara a essere pacato anche Nat; c'\u00e8 la riscoperta di un senso nella vita, che forse non \u00e8 nell'essere straordinari di per s\u00e9, ma nell'essere straordinari per qualcun altro: nel dare un affetto straordinario.Il libro \u00e8 costellato di dialoghi brevi, normali eppure straordinari anch'essi: dalla guardia carceraria che spinge Nat a cercare la verit\u00e0 dentro di s\u00e9, perch\u00e9 tutti viviamo di bugie, alle risposte di Nathan a chi gli chiede come abbia fatto a essere come \u00e8, e perch\u00e9 insista nel fare tutto questo per Nat.E quando alla fine Nat assume del tutto il nome di Nathan, allora il lettore lo vede, il miracolo, e siccome \u00e8 un miracolo molto umano pu\u00f2 non solo crederci, ma cercare di realizzarlo a sua volta."}, {"userName": "Paula Vince", "userReviewDate": "Jul 07, 2013", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/10911644-paula-vince", "userReview": "[ I love the way he takes the reader completely by surprise at times, such as the way he coolly tells the prison officer that he's not intending to pay bail for the boy.

Fifteen years later, the now-teenager has become difficult and the grandmother asks Nathan to raise the young man (Nat).I did not like this book as much as I'd hoped. The Nathan character is far too \"good\" to seem like a real person. He shows very little emotion, just steadfastly goes about supporting Nat emotionally and financially, no matter what Nat throws at him. He's an admirable character, but his lack of frustration, regret or even conflicting emotions in this situation makes him an unrealistic character. And there is very little to explain his motivation to behave this way, other than a last-pages supposition by a minor character.Nat's character is stronger.

It's a newborn, obviously abandoned to die in the woods. Nathan realizes the infant is actually still alive and rushes him to the hospital. He feels compelled to adopt the child, but a grandmother comes forward to take him in instead.Fifteen years later, Nat (named for the man who found him) has become more trouble than his grandmother can handle. He just seems angry at the world. Nathan steps in to care for the teen, who is puzzled by this stranger who does so much for him.I find Catherine Ryan Hyde's books refreshing in that they are ultimately about hope and the innate goodness we humans do have. There is some darkness in the story, but I love that she chooses to portray people at their best. And she does this without getting all sappy. I love me some hope; I gag over sugary sweetness.Nat is a little a lot difficult to like for the most part. He is so angry and defensive. He has reason to be. Just look at his entrance to the world.

He's not someone who learns his lessons easily. He does everything the hardest way possible, making his own life more difficult than it has to be.I loved Nathan. He's quiet and reserved and probably comes off as distant to most of his acquaintances. Being a quiet and reserved girl myself, I can relate. But he's just deeply good. Like Matthew Cuthbert good. He doesn't react blindly to any situation he finds himself or Nat in. He steps back, thinks for a little while, and then tries to find the best advice or course of action. He understands that everyone needs to get a fair chance, so he lets Nat start with a clean slate. And as long as Nat seems to be learning from his mistakes, he keeps caring for him, physically and emotionally.The story did not go where I thought it would. At one point it seemed like a fairly predictable underdog story, but it went in a different direction completely. I was very pleased with it. This is the part where I want to get into the \"moral of the story as I see it,\" but that would get into some vague spoilers, so I won't go there. It's not anything preachy, but it is something that I think we all need to be reminded of from time to time.I do recommend this if you're looking for a book that will give you some hope in humanity. I think we all need a little of that from time to time.Thanks to the author for giving me a copy for review."}, {"userName": "Angelica", "userReviewDate": "Oct 17, 2013", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/5424853-angelica", "userReview": "Unique, interesting, and unpredictable. I appreciated the pensive nature of this book. I felt like I got a glimpse into the mind of a steady, wise, introverted man. That sounds boring, but it was actually endearing, and the story line was strong enough to keep me engaged. I did not anticipate where this author would take the story so I found myself quite surprised at various points along the way. I find myself thinking through the story, remembering bits of quotes and wanting to go back and memorize them. And there's a bit of an unsettled feeling, wanting to know more, wishing there was more to read, trying to fill in the gaps...it's a story that lingers.There are many redeeming qualities in this book, but there's also an overarching sadness, too. How could a book that started with an infant being abandoned in the cold not be sad? Faithfulness, steadfastness, and love in the midst of that sadness makes the book worth reading. On a somewhat tangent soapbox note, the only person in the book who had any faith in God was introduced only for a moment and was a complete jerk. Why is that? Not just why did this author choose to portray her only \"Christian\" character like this, but why is this too often the case in real life? The characters in this story needed a sincere, selfless, loving friend of genuine faith to point them to the source of true joy in the midst of sadness and heartache. Nathan comes close for Nat, but he's still lacking, and who was there for him? That's the kind of person I want to be."}, {"userName": "Lisa", "userReviewDate": "Dec 22, 2013", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/1343007-lisa", "userReview": "Wow. This book is available through the Kindle Lending Library (for all my friends and family who own one) and it is fantastic and free. It is actually Young Adult fiction I think which explains the less complicated prose but the story is still compelling, no matter your age. You can read the summary to get an idea about what the premise of the book is about, but it doesn't tell you how well the author captures that element of love for the sake of it. Love that is given because the person who gives it is doing it for all the right reasons love should be given. What a beautiful story and I personally read it as an allegory, though I don't think the author necessarily intended that. If you have ever asked yourself why to love someone when they have given you no reason to love them, then read this. If you have ever struggled to understand why you are loved given all your flaws, then you need to read this. This book is a page turner because you want desperately to believe that love can change him, and ultimately change all of us."}, {"userName": "Linda", "userReviewDate": "Mar 07, 2014", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/4212127-linda", "userReview": "Sometimes a book makes its way into my hands because I really need to read it, and this was one of them. While I certainly identified with many of the situations in the book, I really needed to read about the quiet strength of one man's devotion, even with some huge sacrifices. I am going through another challenging time in my life, and I'm frequently exhausted and sad. Yet, this book was a great reminder that situations are temporary, but the lasting effects of how I handle them can be huge if don't give up and just keep going. Overall, I thought the book was easy to read, had some interesting twists, and articulated some of the reasons why people do what they do."}, {"userName": "Sarah Hough", "userReviewDate": "Mar 16, 2016", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/4744865-sarah-hough", "userReview": "I listened to the audiobook and on more than one occasion, sat in the car after my trip was over just to keep listening to this story. It's not exactly an easy read because the characters and the topics aren't easy - Nat especially is a complicated, often unlikeable child/man. There are many uncomfortable moments created by Nat's life circumstances and poor choices but Nathan's steadfast and abiding commitment to him adds a palpable sense of calm and surety to the narrative - you know Nat will end up okay because Nathan knows it in his heart. It's lovely writing and if not precisely heart warming in the traditional sense, very moving nonetheless."}, {"userName": "Samantha", "userReviewDate": "Oct 26, 2010", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/4066397-samantha", "userReview": "'When I found you' is a touching (there were some tears)story told from two alternating points of view - it's about a relationship that is essentially a father/son, best described as a foster care/guardian relationship. It's hard going in places but stick with it, and you'll be rewarded. Some of the thoughts in the book made me think about how I might like to be remembered - and how do I go about making that happen? What have I done in my life that's exceptional? Not that I mean this in a bad way, but it made me think about how I might make difference to the life of someone else."}], "description": "When Nathan McCann discovers a newborn baby boy half buried in the woods, he assumes he's found a tiny dead body.
