It begins with Benfu, the main character, being imprisoned like millions of others during Mao's Cultural Revolution. He's considered Black Chinese vs. Red Chinese because he came from an intellectual family and in Mao's China education (other than how to serve the common cause as delineated by Mao's followers) was a negative. Knowing what the consequences were if this were known in the farm work camp Benfu attempts to keep his background hidden. When it's discovered he's punished by beatings and starvation and he's locked up in a shed. He's able to escape and start a family with Calla Lily. Together they rescue unwanted female children who've been abandoned by their families. Oddly Bratt seems to assume this is the mother's fault with the father bearing no part. She alternately blames the grandparents. The father remains innocent in this atrocity. From chapter five, \"...if he'd (Benfu) managed to raise dozens of daughters he didn't see how the woman (birth mother) couldn't take care of just one.\"Benfu's and Calli's family life is touching in the extreme. Many of the girls have physical limitations such as blindness, paralysis, inability to speak, etc. but the couple's love goes a long way to healing at least their emotional scars. There's absolutely nothing to fault in this part of the story though it goes on for too long and is overly sentimental.I wish \"The Scavenger's Daughters\" had been more appropriately marketed to Young Adults because the language and emotions are often simplistic though some of the lessons about Mao's China are more elaborate. Because of this I found myself getting bored and frustrated as the story languished. Maybe some sharper editing would have prevented the needless length of the book (though it's only about 270 pages) and/or the lack of emotional depth the over sentimentality mars it where more restraint might have made the point more succinctly."}, {"userName": "Rebecca", "userReviewDate": "Mar 01, 2014", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/11753921-rebecca", "userReview": "The concept of this book is extremely interesting, and perhaps in the hands of an author with a more thorough attention to developing complex characters, plots, conflicts, and details about place it might have been a riveting novel. I just don't think that's a possibility with this writer. Yes, it is designed to be sentimental and uplifting. Yes, the story of a scavenger who rescues abandoned daughters is highly interesting and necessarily emotional. The problem is that the emotions were so simplistic, the resolution so pat, and the conflict so obviously meant to garner cheap reactions that it made the book seem extremely contrived and ultimately rather boring.An example is the way the history of Benfu and Calla Lilly's only birth child is suddenly introduced. It offers no real details or depth, but serves simply to thinly justify the next action in the story, and quickly explain a hidden trauma. Seems important, except that in the context of this narrative it is just an extra unexplored thread. I actually think that as novel this is way too simplified, even for light reading. It could have been better as either a short story trimmed of unnecessary fluff or a more complex novel, but as it stands it seems like an early draft. Still, it's totally readable, just not at all memorable."}, {"userName": "Marleen", "userReviewDate": "Nov 19, 2017", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/1616365-marleen", "userReview": "I have to admit that I\u2019ve always enjoyed books that depict the wonders of intriguing China, whether it\u2019s an historical or a contemporary read. Indeed, I remember devouring books by Pearl S. Buck during my adolescence. Nowadays, I\u2019ve very much drawn to the captivating stories told by talented Lisa See. Additionally, I had the opportunity to discover the vibrant city of Shanghai this past November during a work trip, and I was more compelled than ever to enjoy another read that had the Chinese culture at its center.I\u2019ve never heard of Kay Bratt, so I gave this book a try, and although this read isn\u2019t filled with long pages describing the Chinese culture and history, it was certainly pleasant enough. I would describe The Scavenger\u2019s Daughters as more of a light read, a family saga with elderly couple Benfu Lao Zheng and Calli Lily as main protagonists. Benfu has had a hard life, having suffered in the sixties during the Cultural Revolution. The circumstances are bit complicated to explain, suffice it to say that it was also his pride that played a big part in the choices he made. It stands clear that Benfu and Calli are courageous, generous and wise; having taken into their home many orphaned, abandoned young girls for decades; feeding, clothing them, but above all loving them. Many of the foundlings were left alone on the side of the street, because they were handicapped or simply because of their gender.This is book 1 of 4 and I might read the others, I don\u2019t know yet. Like I said, what they lack in gravitas and background, they make up in sweetness and hope. To be noted also is that the narrator of the Audiobook, Will Damron, did a great job bringing the story to life."}, {"userName": "Tara Chevrestt", "userReviewDate": "May 23, 2013", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/2544368-tara-chevrestt", "userReview": "This is a story full of morals and lessons, each one will touch a spot on your heart.It begins with a boy...imprisoned, beaten, harmed, all because of his family background.

For when someone shows him this act of kindness, he vows he spend the rest of his life doing good for others.The boy becomes a man, a trash collector. In China, daughters are discarded and abandoned a lot. He finds them in the trash and he keeps them, feeds them, clothes them, provides them as love as he can. With all these daughters, he's relegated to a life of poverty. They don't live like other people, but they have love. They have each other.But what will happen to them all when he dies?

I didn't get any real sense of the atmosphere or culture of China and felt like with minor tweaks this story could have taken place anywhere. It is essentially the old poor-girl-meets-rich-boy plot line with its inherent themes of prejudice and class bias, and it is done neither well nor with any innovation. The writing is unsophisticated, the characters one-dimensional and the dialogue generic. This often felt very much like a young-adult novel, and not a good one at that. I have to give the author some credit for not using a couple of unrealistic, cheesy plot resolutions I was afraid she would but that's not saying much. I will not be reading the rest of the books in this series."}, {"userName": "Ebookwormy1", "userReviewDate": "Apr 06, 2016", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/1005834-ebookwormy1", "userReview": "Numerous China adoptive mamas recommend Kay Bratt's work, so I finally gave in and ordered this book on kindle. Within the first chapter, it was clear that while the concept was compelling and unique (abandoned children being raised by a scavenger in modern China) the execution was incredibly poor.Sprinkling the occasional pin-yin expression and placing your characters in a Chinese city, does not make them Chinese! While Bratt's credentials of living in China for 5 years are trumpeted throughout the marketing material, and many adoptive families recommend the series, PLEASE DO NOT THINK THIS IS CHINA or CHINESE CULTURE! Bratt may have lived among the Chinese, but it is clear that she has completely *failed* to bridge the cultural gap. What's even more disturbing is her complete ignorance that she is far, far, far afield. The result is a borderline ridiculous application of western lifestyle, thought and ideas to shallow, unbelievable characters in simplistic plots that reach novel status simply through attaining a certain word count. I would be utterly embarrassed for a Chinese friend to read this book.Due to their popularity in the American community interested in China, and the cheap price for Kindle, I may read the rest of the series, but writing this review (and noting the ratings/ reviews on-line) horrifies me with renewed recognition that readers think this is China! I thought I could give it 2 stars, but now I'm struggling! I usually reserve a one star rating for books with objectionable content, but this is so saccharine, it seems cruel to lump it in with violence, pedophiles, abusers, etc. And yet, I really don't want you to buy this book and read it thinking you are learning much about China beyond some facts that are easily found (such as why people abandoned children or how children that are wanted by their parents end up abandoned).Please, for the love of China, read Pearl Buck (start with The Good Earth trilogy), or Robert Carter's \"The Barbarians\" or Lisa See's \"Snow Flower and the Secret Fan\" or for non-fiction Scott W. Morton's \"China: It's history and culture\"! And for a non-fiction look at the complex dynamics around abandoned children, see Leslie K. Wang's \"Outsourcing Children: Orphanage Care and Adoption in Globalizing China.\" These books are all written by westerners who have bridged the divide by training themselves to inhale and exhale Chinese culture. They won't get you as far as the Chinese classics, but they will at least be a reasonable glimpse into the elusive and rich world that is China.If you would like a Chinese account on abandonment and motherhood in China, see \"Message of an Unknown Chinese Mother: Stories of Love and Loss\" by Xinran.https://www.goodreads.com/review/show...The Good Earth (House of Earth #1), Buck, 1931https://www.goodreads.com/review/show...Barbarians, Carter, 1998https://www.goodreads.com/review/show...Snow Flower and the Secret Fan, See, 2004https://www.goodreads.com/review/show...China: It's History and Culture, Morton, 1980https://www.goodreads.com/review/show...Outsourcing Children: Orphanage Care and Adoption in Globalizing China, Wang, 2016https://www.goodreads.com/review/show..."}, {"userName": "Kimberly", "userReviewDate": "Aug 21, 2013", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/2501399-kimberly", "userReview": "Most of the novels I have read about China depict a variety of hopeless conditions with a stunning lack of compassion by citizens for their fellow man. When daily life is an epic struggle. with barely enough food to feed yourself, there is often little thought of the suffering of others. And sadly, little regard for a discarded child. The Scavenger's Daughters is about an unlikely couple, poorer than poor, that care about homeless children. While they are the lowest on the social strata they find it in their hearts to take in as many abandoned girls as they can to raise as their own with little assistance from the government. The story begins during Mao's revolution and into modern day China and weaves a beautiful tale of how a couple devastated by their own personal tragedy rebuild their family with discarded children. This is a tale of love and compassion. Of stubbornness and acceptance. The Scavenger's Daughters is a beautifully written family drama mixed with interesting historical fiction.This is the first book in a series and I can hardly wait to read the next one!"}, {"userName": "Mary", "userReviewDate": "Oct 30, 2017", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/15852313-mary", "userReview": "The Palest Ink was one of my favorite reads last year. While that story centers around a young Benfu, Bratt begins the Tales of the Scavenger's Daughters series with an older, much wiser Benfu. His golden years (should they be called that?) are much different than those of his youth, when things came to him easily as the son of wealthy, respectable parents. Having cut ties with his privileged past, Benfu spends his days scavenging. He's a junk collector. Benfu collects and sells other's unwanted trash. Along the way, he has also rescued discarded and orphaned girls that have been thrown away like yesterday's garbage. It's no mistake that Bratt chooses this profession for Benfu and the meaning behind this decision is not lost on me. Understandably, Benfu is resentful and angry at the government that betrayed him as a young man. The communist revolution of Mao Zedong stole young Benfu's life, changing him forever. Benfu's bitter resentment causes him to make decisions that are not always in the best interest of his loved ones. His pride may be the undoing of the family he's worked so hard to protect. The Scavenger's Daughters, narrated beautifully by Will Damron, was a great Audible listen. I have all three ebooks in this series but thought it would be interesting to start the series with the audio version. I wanted to get the feel of things. Damron puts a lot of emotion into his storytelling and was believable as Benfu. He didn't do too bad as Benfu's daughters either. I highly recommend reading the prequel, The Palest Ink, first. I had this series on my kindle for a couple of years. You know how it goes; I really wanted to start the first book way back when. Then, Bratt released the prequel and I'm glad I waited. I feel like the reader will better understand the reasoning behind Benfu's decisions to live life as he does. Besides, I'm not really a fan of going backwards in stories. Every reader has their method. Mix the series up if ya like. There are FIVE books in the series. Tangled Vines Book Two, Bitter Winds Book Three, Red Skies Book Four. Book One is .99c on Amazon. Book Two - Book Four is 1.99. Worth every penny. The Palest Ink completes the series."}, {"userName": "Carmi Henderson", "userReviewDate": "Aug 16, 2013", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/15437908-carmi-henderson", "userReview": "The Scavenger\u2019s Daughter by Kay Bratt is the first book in a trilogy \u201cThe Tales of the Scavenger\u2019s Daughters.\u201d Ms. Bratt was inspired to write the trilogy after learning about scavengers in China who have taken unwanted and abandoned children into their homes. She hopes this book will be an inspiration to others and will raise awareness of the struggles working class people in China face. Zheng Benfu, a scavenger who makes his living by picking up trash to be recycled, Calla Lily his wife and Linnea his oldest daughter living at home are the main characters. The story begins during the Cultural Revolution with Benfu imprisoned in a commune for having a bad family background or \u201cblack\u201d background as opposed to a \u201cred\u201d background. I especially appreciated the information we learn about the Great Leap Forward and the Cultural Revolution. I have read extensively about China and the facts used in the book are all accurate. Benfu\u2019s life is lived in the shadow of what happened to him during that time. Benfu and Calli are loving people who take the many abandoned girls that he finds into their home and make them a part of the Zheng family. We learn how the Cultural Revolution changed the family relationships in China and we see how abandoned and institutionalized children are rejected as inferior and are not allowed to have the same opportunities, such as education, that children with families have. One of my favorite quotes from The Scavenger\u2019s Daughter is in chapter five when Benfu is thinking about his daughter Peony who was abandoned by her mother due to a \u201cpeach size\u201d lump on her head; \u201cOnce again he was struck with a wonderful daughter the woman was missing out on. And for what? If someone waited until they were financially able to have children \u2013 or in this case keep their children \u2013 there wouldn\u2019t be much procreating going on. And if he\u2019d managed to raise dozens of daughters, he didn\u2019t see how the woman couldn\u2019t take care of just one.\u201d I used a similar argument when talking to my husband about adopting our second daughter. \tLinnea is the daughter we are introduced to in this book. She must resolve the conflict between her family\u2019s lifestyle and that of the young man who is in love with her. Will the parents on both sides be accepting? Other conflicts arise that mean all the girls must work together to bring their family through intact. I totally enjoyed this first book and I look forward to the next book in the trilogy. \tI could not find much that was a negative for me. I would have liked to learn more about Calli and I hope that comes in the next book. \tThere were a couple of places where I thought something appeared to be left out. This only happened in pages 220 through 225 when Linnea and Jet are at his parent\u2019s home. Jet is in the kitchen with his mom but then Linnea tells him she needs to get home but we don\u2019t see him come back into the room and on the very next page Jet is pulling into the lane leading to Linnea\u2019s house. We don\u2019t see them saying good-by to Jet\u2019s parents. During the time they are at Jet\u2019s house his mother apparently asks them to collect some information. This is referenced on page 224 but we don\u2019t know what the information is or why she asked for it. On page 221 Linnea is convinced that Jet\u2019s mother does not like her and then on page 225 she says his parents are amazing. Just not sure what is going on in this section. \tI recommend this book to anyone interested in China and how the Cultural Revolution affected the people of China and to anyone who has adopted children from China. \tI received an advanced reader\u2019s copy of this book from the author in exchange for an honest review."}, {"userName": "Jennifer", "userReviewDate": "Dec 24, 2014", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/10153410-jennifer", "userReview": "I really enjoyed this book. As others have mentioned it is written rather simplistically (and contains far too many exclamation marks, an unfortunate pet peeve of mine) but even so the moral of the story is too beautiful for me not to have enjoyed it. The concept of building a family based on companionship and cooperation rather than duty forced by blood really resonated with me. I loved the way in which Benfu, Calli and their adopted daughters face their daily struggles together, helping and supporting each other and making sure that everybody feels not only loved but also significant and vital to the group. Considering so many of the daughters have physical disabilities this is particularly poignant. Nobody is made to feel like a burden, rather they are given an important daily task which they can successfully accomplish. This goes a long way to healing the wounds left on these girls by the abandonment of them by their birth parents. Although not particularly detailed, I did enjoy the history that Benfu tells his daughters about the Cultural Revolution in China and how it affected their society.

She created the fictional family in her novel based on people like Lou Xiaoying who raised over thirty children that were found abandoned on the streets.The novel is somewhat simply told, Benfu and his wife Calli live in poverty, scraping to make enough money to pay their bills. They have a large family of daughters, all of whom have been abandoned by their families and found by Benfu who is a scavenger. He makes his way through town picking up bottles, cans, parts from electronics and anything else that has been discarded but still has some value. He sells what he finds to make a living. Sometimes he finds children who have been discarded, sometimes they are babies who have been thrown away like trash, sometimes they are older with special needs. He and his wife give them a home, love and a family.This is a book you read because you are curious about the circumstances that brought the story to be, for that criteria it meets the expectation. The writing is not very sophisticated, I think this would be appropriate for a Young Adult audience. The time and place isn't well rendered and the characters aren't very well developed. The dialogue is often used to inform the reader about the history of the characters or the history of China and so doesn't sound very realistic.However this is a sweet story of love and affection within a family that was created from the unwanted children, discarded by others. I found it to be fascinating (horrifying) and moving. The three main characters are portrayed realistically enough so their conflicts are compelling to the reader. This won't be the most well written novel I've read this year but I will remember this story.I haven't read anything about this issue before but I would like to read more after finishing this book.

Amy Tan's books are superior as is Balzac and the Little Chinese Seamstress, but there is also: Rock, Paper, Tiger, Til Morning Comes (the first one I read, decades ago), Waiting, Snow Flower and the Secret Fan, and others, all of which present lives in China with attendant historical detail. I thought I was reading a book written for Chinese children, grades 4 - 7, and was surprised to see it was written by an American woman who spent 5 years in China. There was something about the didactic intent, and also the simplistic characters and roles, plus the history repeated several times about Mao's programs and why the Cultural Revolution failed. I even thought I found small errors of translation in the conversations! I suppose I simply found the style stilted. Benfu, son of 2 teachers, is sent for re-education on a commune, and when he voices opinions contrary to the party line, is beaten, starved and tortured. After escaping he meets his future wife and their lives unfold. As a scavenger looking in the alleys where refuse is found, he uncovers abandoned baby girls. He brings them home and over the years has given them hope and love. Some were born with disabilities. He works very hard and they are always poor. The story begins to follow the current oldest daughter and a cross-class romance. On two levels the differences between old traditions and modern thinking are found, and clash. Eventually, proud Benfu learns to accept help.The ending is sweet and meant to be a tear-jerker, but I was frankly tired of the moralistic, simplistic aspects of the book. The story has a wonderful premise (it's supposed to be based on real people) but there is not enough with it. Benfu and his wife are practically saints. Everything is predictable. Each child is distinctively different, and is humble and sweet in her way except Peony. The story threads of Peony and Dahlia were left dangling and I suspect they were left open when the author decided to create a trilogy- she would pick up those stories later. I recommend it for readers who haven't read novels taking place in China before, and for younger readers. I would read the next 2 books only if they came my way without much effort.

A fast read, part of a trilogy."}, {"userName": "Liz", "userReviewDate": "Jul 19, 2015", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/54185-liz", "userReview": "Not sure what to say about this book. I enjoyed listening to it, but it was very strange for a book about people in such a sad situation to have nothing bad really happen over the course of the whole book. Basically, it's a story of how a good poor man got what he deserved. Because nothing bad happens, the plot is kind of lacking. Also, pretty sure this is a history lesson pretending to be a story. Still. As history lessons go, it's pretty enjoyable. As stories go, I'd pick something worth more action."}, {"userName": "Debbi", "userReviewDate": "Aug 21, 2013", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/2282383-debbi", "userReview": "I am learning a lot about the poor in China and how the hierarchy fell out after the cultural revolution. The author weaves it all into the story very effectively. This very devoted couple finds abandoned children, I should say female children as males are never abandoned, and they raise them as their own even though they are the poorest of the poor. There are 4 books in the series. The author states that this really goes on in China where scavengers take abandoned girls home and raise them. She writes to bring attention to their plight."}, {"userName": "Kelsi H", "userReviewDate": "May 10, 2016", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/39252250-kelsi-h", "userReview": "Mao's cultural revolution is an interesting backdrop for this story. I recently read the prequel to this series, which explains how Benfu finds his wife and begins a new life after captivity at one of Mao's work camps. It is a touching story of love, especially in the way that Benfu and Calli bring the abandoned girls into their home and hearts. My only complaint is that I think this novel would be more suited for a young adult audience, as the language especially often seems simplistic, as is the basic treatment of complex themes."}, {"userName": "NancyL Luckey", "userReviewDate": "Jul 13, 2013", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/2029454-nancyl-luckey", "userReview": "During the Cultural Revolution, small and infant girls were often abandoned because of sickness, physical challenges, or just because they are girls. Benfu, who makes his living scavenging landfills, finds these girls and brings them home to be loved and raised. The girls are given flower names and are thought of as a flower garden by Benfu and his wife. Because of experiences in Benfu's youth, caused by a corrupt government, he is too proud to ask later for the help he should receive from government officials for taking the girls on. This book is based on a true story."}, {"userName": "Elissa Wiley", "userReviewDate": "Jul 26, 2016", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/40103622-elissa-wiley", "userReview": "This book had me SOBBING in my car as I was driving down the dark highway by myself to the east coast of Florida. Initially, I was scared. I knew it was about children and I get VERY sensitive to bad things happening to kids. However, Virginia was right. It WAS a feel good book. What a wonderful story. It did make me want to continue to learn of this family's adventure, so I'm glad to learn there are more books in the series."}, {"userName": "Kathleen", "userReviewDate": "Jul 11, 2013", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/4328943-kathleen", "userReview": "Won book from Book Browse to join in there book club discussion this month.

The writing is, at times, lyrical and the Chinese Cultural Revolution history revealed is fascinating, but there is a depth which seems to be missing. I seriously wanted to feel more, to be more deeply enmeshed in emotion (it should be a highly emotional story!), but the style of writing denied me that response. The only reason for giving it 4 stars is the basic content. I did cheer for happy outcomes and recognition for the dedication which one couple selflessly and lovingly provided to the abandoned girls. I think the compassion shown by Benfu and Calla Lily as well as the bonds established between all his scavenged daughters and their saviors is a redeeming factor.I'm still undecided...3 or 4 stars?"}], "description": "Having survived torture and imprisonment during China\u2019s Cultural Revolution, Benfu escaped to find love with his compassionate and beautiful Calla Lily. Together they build a fulfilling life around the most menial of jobs\u2014Benfu\u2019s work collecting trash. As he sorts through the discards of others, he regularly discovers abandoned children. With unwavering determination, he and Calli spend decades creating a family of hand-picked daughters that help heal the sorrow and brighten their modest home. But all is not perfect and when crisis threatens to separate their family, Benfu\u2014or possibly his band of headstrong daughters\u2014must find a way to overcome the biggest hardship yet.
