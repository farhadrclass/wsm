It's been a few years since I've read him. I enjoyed both \"Strength in What Remains\" and \"Mountains Beyond Mountains\"...a book that won the Pulitzer Prize. Kidder is terrific literary journalist. His non-fiction books have a strong story line and personal voice to his writing. This is an 'engaging' -fascinating - personal story about a man named Paul English, CEO and co-founder of Kayak, ( a travel website), founder of an online Chinese chess community called Xiangqi Leauge, had previously worked at Interleaf as SVP of Engineering and Marketing. He worked as a software engineer at Texet, and is presently CEO and co-founder of Lola..... a Boston base travel servicePaul got his degree in Computer Science at UMass --- but has a few funny stories about his experience with college. For starters -he didn't plan to go. Many of his classmates went right into Harvard from his Boston Latin High School. He was the type of kid with low grades - didn't always go to class -but had higher SAT scores more than most of the Harvard kids - so much so, his scores alone won him a free-ride education at UMass. I laughed -- His 'only' reason for going 'at first' was so that he could play in the student Jazz Band. In time, he 'respected' the computer classes and 'felt' like doing some homework. [but he knew he was often smarter than the teacher and students]I had never heard of the Paul English until this book. A few times he reminded me of Steve Jobs.Although while Steve Jobs was first hanging out in a garage in California and was an only child, Paul English grew up in Boston with six other siblings. Tracy Kidder sure makes reading about a man's life interesting. I laughed to myself again ---( but it's not really funny) ---because when you think of 7 kids in a family--don't you immediate think of NOISE in the house? Well, Paul's mother was sick for the first 10 years of Paul's life. She suffered from myasthenia graves, an autoimmune disease, that causes muscle weakness-- she wasn't sick all the time -- yet debilitating.Paul's father told the children they were going to kill their mother if they weren't quiet. Paul believed him. I was laughing because I was thinking how 'smart' his mother to find a way to keep 7 kids quiet in her house. haha! Actually- when Paul was 10 years old, his mother went to a Catholic priest who said to have power to heal those with great faith. She recovered it was never sick again. WOW! Maybe I ought to convert! haha again! There are many wonderful things about Paul English. Much to admire. I can see why Tracy Kidder wanted to write about him. He was extremely gifted- inventive- and contributed to the world of technology- but there are so many other wonderful qualities about him as a man, humanitarian, team player, and friend. He took inspiration from a man name Tom White, a Harvard Grad...who helped found \"Partners In Health\"... known for its work in medicine in Public health in Haiti. Tom had donated 20 million to the organization. When Paul first met him, he was 80 years old. Paul says to Tom, \"I heard 20 million came from you\". Tom blushed. \"Oh, I don't know about that\". \"Paul grinned at him. I bet you think that makes you a good person. I think that makes you a shitty fundraiser\". Those two guys were great friends until Tom died at age 90. Paul gave Tom a million bucks and continued to donate money to Tom's favorite causes.And THIS IS MY FAVORITE QUOTE IN THIS BOOK:\"I feel sorry for people that are wealthy and are sitting there with millions \u2013 \u2013 some of them billions \u2013 \u2013 just making more money. I ask myself, 'For what'? Why don't they take a few million and give it to the very poor and marginalized people all over the world who suffer so much, in great part because of the greed of the wealthy?\" After Tom died, and Haiti suffered its devastating earthquake, Paul suggested the use of one of the expensive cholera vaccines and declared, \"I'll backstop it\". \"And let's vaccinate a hundred thousand people.\" It worked - helped kick off a vaccination campaign. A beautiful telling of Paul getting a diagnosis of bipolar - and his learning the best way to manage it - and live with it. An innovative empowering management style - hard working-dedicated -trustworthy and loyal. Tracy Kidder is such a terrific storyteller!!!! This book - about Paul English is uplifting and refreshing!!!Thank You Random House, NetGalley, and Tracy Kidder"}, {"userName": "Holly", "userReviewDate": "Nov 22, 2016", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/4763049-holly", "userReview": "With a title like \"A Truck Full of Money\" and a bright rainbow-y cover I assumed this would be about a person who gives his money to the less-fortunate or uses his wealth to make the world a better place. Lord knows I'm ready to read about a generous American this month. And while I'm not particularly a Kidder fan, his subjects are sometimes interesting (Paul Farmer and Partners in Health; the Burundian immigrant in Strength in What Remains). I realize that he has earned the respect and vast readership to write about whatever he damn well wants, be it men named \"Paul\" or building a house or internet start-ups. (BTW could he stretch himself to write about women? Has he written about a woman since the teacher in Among Schoolchildren thirty-some years ago?)But A Truck Full of Money isn't about a person who \"recovers from his great success\" (per the subtitle) by doing good works at all. Instead it's \"I have all this money and I'm still bored so what should I do next? - I'll start a new company!\" ~ It's a book about management. And except for a gratuitous scene near the end where Paul English tags along in the van with an actual humanitarian giving aid to homeless people of Boston, it's not about giving back. He's just bored. Sure, Paul English has overcome some adversity in life: he has a wicked temper and violent streak, and his bipolar diagnosis is serious. But he's a rich educated white male, after all, and he has the financial resources to manage his medications and find physicians he likes, not to mention a roof over his head (several rooves), and the luxury to take as much time off work as he needs when he's having trouble. Paul English isn't a bad man, and he might be one of the better bosses to work for in this milieu, but he's a lucky man and his story was really not very interesting to me. I'm think I'm actually offended by this book. Unlike some reviewers I didn't necessarily have a problem with the jumbled chronology with which Kidder presents the story. If anything, I have a suspicion that it gave the book a little more life than it would have had if told straight and I'd bet that he first composed it in linear chronology, but he or an editor noticed how blah it was - so they mixed it up to give it some jagged momentum. Anyway, many people will like this book and it's an easy read - both in the sense of the prose and in the sense that it won't challenge any American worldviews."}, {"userName": "Lorilin", "userReviewDate": "Nov 01, 2016", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/5887880-lorilin", "userReview": "Paul English is the cofounder of Kayak.com, the popular website that helps buyers find the cheapest flight available across multiple airline sites. English built the company from the ground up, and, in 2012, after Kayak (very successfully) went public, he sold the whole caboodle for almost 2 billion dollars.A Truck Full of Money is English's biography as told by Pulitzer Prize winner Tracy Kidder. Though the book covers the typical topics you'd expect to see in a life story (like English's childhood, his various career moves, and descriptions of the key friends and coworkers in his life), it also covers some things that surprised me--for instance, English's bipolar disorder, his extreme discomfort (guilt?) with earning so much money, as well as his experiences working with homeless people. I honestly wasn't expecting to read so much about mental health, the ethics and expectations of having money, or homelessness, but all three topics ended up adding a lot to the book. My awareness of these issues increased, and I felt like I understood Paul English better.Overall, I'd say that I liked this book well enough. Honestly, it wasn't what I was expecting based on the product description I read. But it was still okay. Certain parts bored me, but other parts really surprised me (in a good way), so it mostly balanced out in the end. If you really like techie biographies (I don't), you will probably enjoy this one.See more of my reviews at www.BugBugBooks.com."}, {"userName": "Sue", "userReviewDate": "Nov 11, 2016", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/3642045-sue", "userReview": "Having read and enjoyed Mountains Beyond Mountains: The Quest of Dr. Paul Farmer, A Man Who Would Cure the World by Tracy Kidder, and also having seen an interview with Paul English on my local (Boston) PBS station, I definitely was interested in reading this story of English's life to date: his success in programming is legendary but I knew only bits and pieces otherwise, hints of his wealth, his bipolar disorder, etc. What Kidder is able to do is to link the man of the present with the boy who grew up in Boston, became enthralled with programming and excelled at what he touched--eventually. Sort of a rags to riches story with blips along the way.While I am not a person who can understand the details of programming, this book is written to indicate the complexity without requiring knowledge of the actual art. Thankfully for me. Paul English seems to be the kind of man I might not understand on one level--i.e. his professional level, but I think I would enjoy the opportunity to meet and talk with him about his goals, beliefs, the things he enjoys, etc. I appreciate the value system he has adopted in his career and with his employees and fellow workers during his adult life, as well as the role models he has chosen.This is an interesting story of early days in the technology industry, when start-ups could fly or flop and programmers could write their own ticket. Some succeeded. Some failed. This is the tale of the boy who came from very little and grew to the top and then what did he do? Kidder and English present a warts and all picture though I think the \"all\" far outweigh any warts. It is also an interesting glimpse of the effects of bipolar disorder on a daily level for a hard driving man.A copy of this book was provided by the publisher through NetGalley in return for an honest review."}, {"userName": "Karen", "userReviewDate": "Sep 30, 2016", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/3060349-karen", "userReview": "Pulitzer Prize winner Tracy Kidder writes a great biography of Paul English, the man who built Kayak into a multi-billion dollar company. A passionate techie entrepreneur and philanthropist, Paul\u2019s story is extraordinary. Paul grew up during the early days of the personal computer, software engineering and the Internet. He was pegged as an overachiever early in life when he ranked 8th out of several thousand 12-year olds taking admissions testing for prestigious Boston Latin School. Paul was unhappy that seven others had done better. I would have loved to have found out if any of the seven were recognizable names but this was not shared. Paul\u2019s ideas just keep churning. His innovative brain never appears at rest, perhaps due to his manic side (he was diagnosed with bipolar disorder in the 70\u2019s). I was completely absorbed at 7% in and highlighted so many passages of good ideas and inspiration that my book looks like a patchwork quilt. The leaps of faith, dedication and investment of long-time friends in helping Paul achieve his goals were amazing. Paul was a \u2018force field of energy\u2019, had so much common sense, compassion for customers and respect for his staff at the companies he founded."}, {"userName": "Marlene", "userReviewDate": "Sep 24, 2016", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/7001837-marlene", "userReview": "Originally published at Reading RealityThe first book of Tracy Kidder\u2019s that I ever read was The Soul of a New Machine, an inside look at the development of a new 32-bit minicomputer at Data General in the late 1970s. In internet years, that feels like several centuries ago.The universe of computing, and the universe of the ways in which our lives are impacted by computers and related technology, has changed immeasurably since that \u201csoul\u201d was put into that \u201cnew machine\u201d. But those giants at Data General are to a significant extent the ones whose shoulders the subject of this new book stand. As is Tim Berners-Lee, the inventor of the world wide web in 1989.Without the evolution in computer technology that took us from computers that filled rooms to what were then called minicomputers because they were considerably smaller than that to the PC revolution to the Internet, our world would be immeasurably different. So, just as The Soul of a New Machine was the story of a group of people who helped build the revolution, A Truck Full of Money is about the soul of the new tech economy, as seen through the eyes of a man who is one of its avatars, and one of its success stories.The story follows the career of Paul M. English, the creator of numerous companies throughout the internet age, including Boston Light, the very successful Kayak.com and his current company, Lola Travel. English has a knack for not just having a great idea for a company, but building a team that can carry it through to success, and subsequent sale for \u201ca truck full of money\u201d to someone else. And then he starts all over again.Not every one of his ideas succeeds. But the ones that do, really, really do. Like Kayak.com.The author uses English\u2019s biography to tell his story, making it both a look into the tech economy of start-ups, venture capital and failing frequently, often and hopefully upwards as well as the biography of one individual who has been mostly successful in that environment.English himself is a fascinating character to watch, from his beginnings in working-class Boston in the 1970s to his hyper success in nearly every decade afterwards \u2013 interspersed not just with a series of failures but also with his coping with, and sometimes failing to cope with, a bipolar disorder that causes episodes of hypomania. Sometimes the black dog of depression bites hard, but more often the demons of hypomania gave English incredible amounts of energy and very little ability to process the rapid firing of his brain or the people that he needed to carry out any of his visions.And in the middle of all of his success, his desire to help people. Not just on the intimate scale of taking care of the people who are close to him, but in the broader humanitarian goal of helping with several crises around the world, particularly in Haiti and in his Boston hometown.Escape Rating B-: A Truck Full of Money is an interesting book, but it didn\u2019t grab me as much as I remember The Soul of a New Machine did when I listened to it sometime in the 1990s. Admittedly, a long time ago.One issue is that A Truck Full of Money isn\u2019t told in a linear fashion. Each of the vignettes is interesting, but the coherent whole doesn\u2019t emerge. Thinking about it, the non-linearity probably reflects the subject, who, when he is on, sparks ideas in multiple directions simultaneously.We also don\u2019t see much of the subject\u2019s relationships with colleagues and family, except on a superficial level. The characters in this biography seem to brought on to show their function in the work rather than their place in the life. This may be a reflection of what these relationships actually are, but it feels a bit hollow.We see a lot more of the what than the why.While this isn\u2019t a book about bipolar disorder, there is more depth in dealing with this part of the subject\u2019s life than anything else that hits close to the bone.One of the most interesting parts is seeing the way that this economy, which has powered so much of the development of the technology sector, really works. The way that venture capitalists deal with fledgling businesses, and the how and why of where their funding comes from and how they decide what to do with it, explains a lot about the way things work now.If you\u2019ve ever worked for a company that was bought by venture capital firms, or in an industry that is dominated by such firms, that part is fascinating.All in all, A Truck Full of Money makes an interesting and readable bookend to The Soul of a New Machine. In a strange way, that feels like the beginning of a story, and this one feels like, not the end, but maybe the end of its middle."}, {"userName": "Kasa Cotugno", "userReviewDate": "Sep 26, 2016", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/2345554-kasa-cotugno", "userReview": "Fascinating.

In this case, Paul English, an Internet billionaire who makes the best use of his resources."}, {"userName": "Brad Feld", "userReviewDate": "Aug 13, 2016", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/7288218-brad-feld", "userReview": "I\u2019m a huge Tracy Kidder fan. I read The Soul of A New Machine as a senior in high school and, even though I don\u2019t include it in the reason I went to MIT, I\u2019m sure it played a part. To this day, it\u2019s still one of my favorite books, although I haven\u2019t read it in many years. I just kindled it (and several other Tracy Kidder books I\u2019ve decided to re-read) and expect it\u2019ll be in my near term reading list.About a month ago Paul English sent me an email asking me if I wanted to read an ARC of Tracy Kidder\u2019s new book A Truck Full of Money. Paul and I haven\u2019t worked together, but I knew him from a distance because of Kayak, the Boston startup community, and a few interactions we\u2019d had over the years, including a long conversation via videoconference where we talked about depression and his new company Blade.My answer was a rapid yes after his mention of Tracy Kidder. But what really got my attention was the line in his email that follows:\u201cThe book deals with my bipolar stuff, and your writings on depression have been meaningful to me.\u201dThat\u2019s about as vulnerable a sentence you will see from an entrepreneur. The idea of exposing oneself around this topic to a writer like Tracy Kidder was incredibly brave to me. So now I was doubly interested.I read the book the day after it arrived at my office. It was five stars \u2013 off the charts awesome on many levels. I asked Paul if I could blog about it and he asked me to hold off until his publisher said it was ok to do it. It\u2019s now ok to do so.Tracy Kidder wrote an amazing book. Paul like many entrepreneurs, is a complex person. Kidder doesn\u2019t dwell on the good or the bad. He shifts effortlessly between the past, present, and future. Paul is the main character, but it\u2019s not Paul\u2019s biography. Kayak plays a role, but so does Blade, as does Paul\u2019s childhood and early jobs. Interleaf makes an appearance (if you remember Interleaf, you just dated yourself. If you don\u2019t remember Interleaf, you need to go learn about it because it was a really important pre-Web and then Web-transition company.)The book isn\u2019t about mental health and biopolar disorder. But Paul\u2019s struggle with it is woven throughout and by the end of the book you have a good understanding of how it has been both a positive and a negative force in Paul\u2019s life and career. Kidder does a magnificent job of teasing out moments that create the example of bipolar disorder without pounding the reader over the head with it. All of this makes Paul a complete human rather than just an entrepreneurial machine.In the absence of a spectacular writer, Paul\u2019s story is a fun one to read. But Kidder brings out another layer to the story, the person, the personality, how bipolar disorder impacts Paul and everyone around him, and how they respond, adjust, and calibrate to it.Ultimately, it\u2019s an incredibly intimate book. While I\u2019m very open about my life, it takes an absurd amount of courage to hand yourself over to someone like Kidder. Paul did it in the context of his own struggles with bipolar disorder, against the backdrop of a complex entrepreneurial journey, at the beginning of his next act.The only thing I disliked about the book was the title. It\u2019s catchy, but it doesn\u2019t capture the complexity of the book, or the protagonist. But that\u2019s ok \u2013 titles are hard to get right and are really just a pointer to the content of the book.Paul \u2013 thanks for being brave enough to let yourself be the subject of a Tracy Kidder book. Tracy \u2013 while I don\u2019t know you, know that you have a mega-fan out in the world who has read all of your books. And, if you are an entrepreneur, investor, or curious about the intersection of mental health and entrepreneurship, or just love a great non-fiction book that reads like a novel, A Truck Full of Money should be the next book you read."}, {"userName": "Charly", "userReviewDate": "Oct 06, 2017", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/584414-charly", "userReview": "This was the story of Paul English, founder of Kayak.com.

Paul English, Kayak.com CEO, while being a very impressive person, is yet another successful person in software, that came from rags or riches (and contributed money for good causes). I prefer personally the Steve Jobs biography or reading about Bill Gates career (and his and Melinda Gates philanthropic work).The more interesting parts of the book were his coping with bipolar disorder, and sleep apnea. And how the manic side, can be both helpful many times and destructive at other times. He came from a poor family, growing up amongst seven siblings, and far from being in a healthy environment (e.g. his father told the children they were going to kill their mother if they weren't quiet). In Paul's eyes, his father saying \"you're all the same\", meant that he expect all of them to be the exactly the same, and that made him feel he had to make a separate life away from home and succeed. It immediately reminded me of Outliers: The Story of Success by Malcolm Gladwell. Coming from rags is a huge obstacle, but for the ~10% that succeed it might be a huge advantage in life. The book had one big weakness, Kidder was jumping around and there was no chronological order at all. It also made the book repetitive, especially around the life partnership with several of his colleagues. As I think we all know, in a start up it is mostly about the people. And a strong seed of cofounders can make miracles. Billo (Bill Aulet) and Schwenk went with Paul from company to company, and at last from Kayak to Blade. I was especially impressed with Billo, the guy sound like a great technical guy and the more rare skill to be an outstanding manager, and great to have around.English is the kind of person that is playing with seven impossible ideas before breakfast. At some point in the book, Kidder started giving a long list of projects that he had in mind that didn't mature (mostly because he didn't act on them, so little time, even if you sleep only four hours a night).Overall, 3 stars. If you are passionate about hi-tech biographies it's a good read, but not essential. Nothing new in new colorful cover."}, {"userName": "Larry Deaton", "userReviewDate": "Dec 03, 2016", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/2980533-larry-deaton", "userReview": "Just a great book. Maybe Tracy Kidder has come full circle in some sense by coming back to a book about the computer industry.In 1981, Trace Kidder wrote The Soul of a New Machine about the efforts of computer engineers at Data General to get a new computer, a minicomputer to market. I loved that book, even though with hindsight it wasn't as well written as I thought at the time. But it captured the excitement of the team at Data General and explained the technical issues at just the right level for a general audience.In A Truck Full of Money, Kidder now tells the story of Paul English, the founder of kayak.com and lola, two really different travel sites. English has dealt with bipolar disorder all of his life. I don't want to say he has suffered from it, because he has seems to have figured out how to use his bipolar disorder in a positive way, but boy, there is some suffering still. Kidder describes how English coped as a child with this disorder, and I really enjoyed that part of the book. Much of the book is about how English decided he wanted to give away all of his money for charitable causes other than some funds he put into a trust fund. But even as he does gets more devoted to charitable giving, he still wants to keep on doing new things in the software industry. He tries and fails ... and tries and fails ... and tries and succeeds with his new company, lola.

Though their stories may be leavened by references to the negative side of their character, the overall effect is overwhelmingly positive. Not so with Tracy Kidder\u2019s even-handed new account of a successful software entrepreneur, A Truck Full of Money. Kidder doesn\u2019t skimp on the man\u2019s business successes. There were several. But he devotes nearly as much time to the many failures \u2014 and to his psychiatric problems. It\u2019s a remarkable tale.A software entrepreneur who isn\u2019t a billionaireKidder\u2019s subject is Paul English. Unlike the best-known people in his field, such as Bill Gates and Mark Zuckerberg, English has never made billions. Not even one billion. But by everyday standards \u2014 mine, and presumably yours, too \u2014 he became fabulously rich. At one point his fortune totaled about $120 million. That\u2019s not even enough to buy and maintain a mid-sized LearJet. Poor guy, right? And unlike creative geniuses such as Steve Jobs, English didn\u2019t make his money from brilliant inventions of his own. (You do know that Gates and Zuckerberg didn\u2019t either, don\u2019t you?)A rare combination of talentsIt turns out, in Kidder\u2019s telling, that Paul English possessed that rare combination of extraordinary talent as a programmer and the ability to inspire and manage teams of equally brilliant people. His big success story was Kayak, a travel site unlike Expedia and Travelocity in that its purpose is not to sell users anything. A few years before 2004, when English cofounded Kayak, he had made a much smaller fortune when he sold an earlier company on the cusp of the dot-com crash.A brutally honest account of bipolar disorderIf you\u2019re involved in the high-tech business, you might find most rewarding the story of English\u2019s progression from one job to another \u2014 until he finally got really lucky. For the general reader, though, Kidder\u2019s no-holds-barred account of his subject\u2019s experience with bipolar disorder stands out. There\u2019s no sense summing up that story here. If the subject interests you, read this book. Kidder does a terrific job of conveying the pain English has suffered \u2014 and the problems his disorder caused for him in business. By the way, English insisted that Kidder tell the whole story with complete honesty.One egregious errorKidder committed one egregious error in A Truck Full of Money. In a passage about the history of the software industry, he writes: \u201cIn the 1960s, IBM created a complex operating system called DOS and all but gave it away \u2014 to Microsoft, then a small company.\u201d There are several problems with this assertion. First, IBM did not create DOS. It was the product of a small software firm in Seattle that was one of Microsoft\u2019s rivals. Second, DOS was written for personal computers, which weren\u2019t developed until the 1970s. Third, Microsoft wasn\u2019t around in the 1960s, either. The company was founded in 1975. Fourth, nobody gave DOS away. Bill Gates bought it for a pittance, and negotiated an extraordinarily one-sided royalty contract with IBM that became the cornerstone of his immense wealth. This is the sort of bonehead error I would never expect from Tracy Kidder. I\u2019m genuinely surprised he didn\u2019t hire a fact-checker.About the authorThe list of published American nonfiction authors is staggeringly long, but only a handful of outstanding writers among them are actively working today. Tracy Kidder is unquestionably one of them. In 1982 he won both the Pulitzer Prize and the National Book Award for The Soul of a New Machine, an intimate look at the engineering of what was then one of the most ingenious and bestselling computers in the industry. A Truck Full of Money, his twelfth book, returns him to the high-tech industry after more than three decades of revolutionary changes."}, {"userName": "Stephanie", "userReviewDate": "Sep 02, 2016", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/8370061-stephanie", "userReview": "Kidder continues to write enchanting non-fiction."}, {"userName": "exncgal", "userReviewDate": "Sep 17, 2016", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/26455658-exncgal", "userReview": "I had such high hopes for this book. I rarely read biographies, or much nonfiction at all, but was intrigued enough to give this a try. Local Boston stuff, poor kid strikes it rich doing something he loves, a successful battle against mental illness, etc. What's not to love?Well, unfortunately, there is a LOT not to love. The story is told completely out of chronological order. It's not even filled with flashbacks; I couldn't find any logic to the order in which things were told. It jumped around more than Sam Beckett did on Quantum Leap; without Al or Ziggy to provide some narrative structure, I felt lost. The storytelling left a lot to be desired as well. There was no discussion of Paul's dating life, but suddenly around page 105 the author mentioned that he got married. How did that happen? It was stated with the same level of emphasis as if he'd gone grocery shopping. I read about 90 pages, set the book aside for about 10 days, and came back to try to finish... but to no avail. This is going on the \"gave up\" list. I just can't get past the choppy writing style and disconnected narrative.

Brilliant, energetic, indefatigable, diagnosed as bi-polar, he founded several astonishingly successful companies, some of which he sold for a huge profit. If you've ever wondered just what it takes to succeed in the tech field, this book is for you. Kidder not only describes the great successes of Paul English, but he also gives us a glimpse into someone who is deeply committed to sharing his great wealth. Yes, the man made tons of money, but he also gave a lot of it away. A fascinating portrait of a man for our times. Publication date for the book is early September."}, {"userName": "Jim", "userReviewDate": "Sep 01, 2016", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/44116587-jim", "userReview": "Fantastic inside look at the big money men creating magic with the internet.

Growing up in working-class Boston, English discovers a medium for his talents the first time he sees a computer. As a young man, despite suffering from what would eventually be diagnosed as bipolar disorder, he begins his pilgrim\u2019s journey through the ups and downs in the brave new world of computers.

This is a rarity, especially when it comes to a book club pick, which is what A Truck Full of Money was to me. I try really hard to finish all book club selections but I just could not get past the 45% mark on my Kindle.It\u2019s well-written, so it\u2019s definitely not the writing that caused me to eventually give up. No, I believe it was the subject matter. I work in Information Technology. I am surrounded by programmers and application developers but within the higher education sector so I expected to be somewhat enlightened to this new world of start-ups but I was bored people! Bored out of my mind.At one point, Paul English becomes heavily involved in philanthropy and this part interested me because when someone is in possession of that much money, and we are talking quite a bit of money, it\u2019s admirable when they choose to support charitable causes.Kidder goes back into English\u2019s childhood and here again, I was kind of pulled in only to be pushed away again. It just wasn\u2019t enough for me to keep reading but he was the founder of Kayak.com and battled bipolar disorder to get to where he is today so I\u2019m not really sure what didn\u2019t work for me because his story is certainly compelling.Have you read A Truck Full of Money?

His ventures, large and small, some hare-brained and some brilliant, some failed and some successful, were and still may be, all over the map, but he made fortunes and lost fortunes, because he was in the right time and the right place at the crossroads of an America about to enter cyberspace. For English, it was full speed ahead into the future; he had the nerve and the brain power to survive and succeed. English was a risk taker, and he sometimes broke rules, even as a school boy. To partner with him, you would risk failure, but when you succeeded, it would be beyond your wildest dreams. His creation Kayak, which merged with Priceline, set him up financially for the rest of his life. He became a very wealthy man.The book begins describing him as a troubled young boy who continued to be troubled as a young man. He struggled with huge mood swings, and manic episodes. He was finally diagnosed with bi-polar disorder. He researched his mental illness to find out how to control it better without becoming a zombie from the medications. He resisted them because of their side effects, but over many years and many trials and errors, he finally found a woman who validated him and medications he could tolerate. Together, they could keep him centered. His illness worked to his benefit because it inspired him to keep thinking and doing and to not accept failure as a consequence, but to always rise up in the face of it and begin again. He often judged himself and found he fell short of the mark. This inspired him to do better. When his mom said \u201ckeep up the good work\u201d, on her deathbed, he interpreted her remark to mean he, so far, hadn\u2019t done well enough. His moments of depression, the alternate side of his bi-polar disease, never seemed to gain control of him. He always kept trying to do something else to change the world, to enter modernity with a bang.He needed to always have a project in the pipeline, something on the drawing board, something to work on that would move him in a useful and a productive direction. He liked building teams of workers. He wanted to interact with others to get ideas, and even today, that need inspires him to use his own Tesla to drive for Uber, not for the money but because he likes to interact with people, to learn about their ideas. These may be the people he might someday consider hiring to work for him on a project. So, he always needed to keep busy, busier when he was in a mania phase of his bipolar disease, but it was his passion that stood out most for those people who worked with him or listened to him or attended his classes. His display of sheer excitement, when an idea came to him, and he promoted it, actually enticed people to join in his efforts and endeavors. Some were wary of his impulsiveness, at times, and tried to rein him in, but it also attracted the creative technocrats who admired his passion.He was inspired to create an anti NRA organization for people who liked guns but thought there should be better controls for the industry. It failed, but not because of lack of good reasons, but more because of lack of interest. Some of his ideas failed, not because they were not good ideas, but because they were before their time. Another person would bring them to the world, like Uber and Trip Advisor and cars that could think and act to curtail speeding and prevent accidents. He brought aid to Haiti when he witnessed the sad state of affairs for the children. He investigated the homeless situation to find out how he could better help them, aside from simply donating money.English is definitely one of the do-gooders in our time. He doesn\u2019t waste too much time thinking about what he should do, he acts on his ideas promptly. He took time off to care for his father when his memory began to fail. Until it was necessary to put him in a facility, he was devoted. He is one of those people who is more interested in the value that his work brings to the world rather than in the money he receives for it or the money he pays for it. Fortunately, his successes have placed him in a financial position to feel that way. The results of his efforts are what actually inspire him. His need to help others less fortunate is genuine and he seeks out those who need help.Paul English never stared defeat in the face, rather he looked askance at it, dusted himself off and sought another avenue to explore and build upon, another company, another group of people to support and to encourage in their endeavors.English is driven by the idea of opportunity. His results, come what may, don\u2019t deter him. If he fails he just keeps trying to succeed. The mania part of his illness works positively for him because it keeps him on his toes, thinking and creating constantly. The book is well written for what it is, but I really had no interest in it. The narrator did as good a job as one would expect for a book that was a bit dry, but I wasn\u2019t inspired by it, although the subject of the books apparent \u201cgoodness\u201d is admirable. I will soon have a hard copy and will give it another look-see, since I am going to an author breakfast with him.

I envy their certainty. I didn't know quite what to think of Tracy Kidder's approach to Paul English, the protagonist. At first I thought that was a weakness of my comprehension, but then I thought, well, maybe that's supposed to be the point. There are certainly enough worshipful biographies of tech start-up geniuses out there. Why produce another one? If the deadline-pressured reviewers at \n  The New York Times\n or the Boston Globe, perhaps encouraged by the Marketing Department of Random House, want to slam this into a familiar frame as another inspirational life-story of an entrepreneur, I guess that's fine \u2013 those type of books seem to sell well and I'm sure Kidder can use the money. But Kidder has a long string of books about admirable and selfless characters behind him. I thought I detected here a desire in the author to do something different, specifically, to present the entrepreneur as Kidder saw him, which is, with plenty to admire but also plenty not to.I think I'm not alone when I say that I read in part to get AWAY from life's ambiguous signals, not to accumulate more of them, but I also recognize that it's good intellectual exercise. It's also not so hard to take when the prose is as clear and easy-to-read as Kidder's is. I received an free advance reader's copy of the ebook for review as did, apparently, many others. The ways of marketing is a mystery to me.

I heard good things about Tracy Kidder and was excited to have the opportunity to review this book, thank you Random House! A Trunk Full of Money is a non-fiction piece on Paul English, an entrepreneur and computer genius who although poor as a child, made a fortune when kayak.com was acquired by Priceline. He then attempts to figure out how to manage this level of wealth and how to give some away to help others.While incredibly good in the area of technology, Paul also has bipolar disorder and I liked how that was an honest part of the story without being the entire focus. I also enjoyed stories from his childhood such as when he created a program that would allow him to steal his teacher's username and password without being caught.That said, I wasn't the biggest fan of this book. I read books on a wide range of topics and even things not typically interesting to me, like cremation for example, can be made incredibly fascinating by the author (such as Smoke Gets in Your Eyes by Caitlin Doughty ). This was not the case with this book. I just didn't care; I wasn't interested in his business deals or his money. Also, the story was told by Tracy Kidder so was very distanced from the author's actual experience of what happened to him. Obviously I knew that going into this, but the characters seemed flat and some were referenced to by their role in relation to Paul without names. I think I was hoping for a bit more depth. I'm bummed that I wasn't a fan, but will have to try other Tracy Kidder books in the future."}, {"userName": "Schuyler Wallace", "userReviewDate": "Sep 25, 2016", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/1140776-schuyler-wallace", "userReview": "There\u2019s not a lot to say about Tracy Kidder\u2019s writing ability. He\u2019s written books about many subjects and won awards for most of them. \u201cA Truck Full of Money\u201d is another in a line of highly readable and interesting books about ordinary things. This time he tells us about a manic man engaged in one of the most frenetic activities of modern day\u2014profiting from the computer craze.Kidder has written best sellers about computers, building a house, immigration, medical miracles, education, old age, war, and small cities. Each has its own story, its own special attraction. And Kidder, a storyteller of immense talent, takes readers where they never thought they were interested.In Truck, we read about frenetic entrepreneur, Paul English, who uses his talents in computer science to build highly successful websites such as Kayak, then immediately moving on to new enterprises, sometimes making a fortune, other times not so much. Diagnosed as bipolar, English moves through the Internet age with the force of a tornado, dragging trusted associates along to either accumulate huge sums of money, or give it away in philanthropic largesse. New ideas abound. Money flows like water. And English rides the waves in unabashed glee.Kidder handles this type of frantic activity with quiet exploration and magnetic language. The amazing story of how to obtain massive sums of money with seemingly frothy ideas radiated with me, a man of little imagination but big aspirations.

His focus is on Paul English, an entrepreneur with 30+ years of starting IT businesses. We get a short but informative summary of how English has been successful in creating businesses that are successful. The major theme of this part of the book \u2013 English never finished college. The major accomplishment for English was the creation and development of Kayak.com. English wants to start a new company that changes how we think about technology. English\u2019s career moves him from a guy writing code (very, very successfully) to overseeing a large high tech, constantly changing online company. The change in his persona is perhaps the most informative story line in the book. He wonders if he can \u201ccreate again\u201d in a business that is driven by young guys (mostly) in jeans and t-shirts working 24 hour shifts in dingy basements. He survives the bursting bubble of high tech. Kidder takes us back stage as English prepares to do a Ted talk.
