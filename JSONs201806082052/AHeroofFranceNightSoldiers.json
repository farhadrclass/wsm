Every window is hung with thick, black curtains, turning the apartments into small dark boxes. Curfews curtail the Parisian nightlife. The city of light has become the city of midnight. The French want their city back. Mathieu is a man who has slowly and carefully put together a network of resistance fighters. To call them fighters gives the impression that they are soldiers, but they are not soldiers. They are just regular people who want to do what they can to undermine the efforts of the Germans to control Paris. \u201dAiding Mathieu as part of his covert network are Lisette, a seventeen-year old student and courier; Max de Lyon, an arms dealer turned nightclub owner; Chantal, a woman of class and confidence; Daniel a Jewish teacher fueled by revenge; Joelle, who falls in love with Mathieu; and Annemarie, a willful aristocrat with deep roots in France.\u201dOne of their main tasks is to make contact with downed British airmen, secure new identification documentation for them, and get them out of the country. The women of the resistance provide cover by escorting these men on trains and getting them to safety. It is dangerous work. If they are caught by the German Military Police, they will be tortured and killed. Mathieu is trying to keep his group autonomous, but the longer they operate, the more money they require. He has friends who have given what they can, but it is simply not enough. The British have offered to finance him, but with their money comes strings. If they want him to do something, he won\u2019t have any choice but to do what they ask. An old lover gets in touch with him and wants him to join the Communist resistance. They are currently sitting on their hands because Stalin and Hitler are uneasy allies, but they know the lust for conquest will eventually lead the Miniature Schnauzer in Berlin to declare war on Russia. The problem, of course, is knowing who to trust. He knows that by expanding his organization or by joining forces with another resistance group he is running a higher risk of exposure. Mathieu has friends in the right places, but though they might offer him a discount to help him with his efforts, they still need money to make things work on their end. He meets one of his contacts in a hotel room, and the man is wearing only his underpants. Mathieu must take off his clothes to talk business. That is one way to have everything out in the open. \u201dFurther into the room, three women, two blondes and a brunette, also in their underwear, were sprawled out amid the tangled sheets and blankets on the spacious bed. Prostitutes? Not quite, Mathieu thought. A classier version of the breed, Parisian ladies out for a night to make money. Tomorrow, proper bourgeois women.\u201dThat scene conveys the state of affairs in Paris. Money is scarce. Food is scarcer. People are forced to do unconventional things to keep themselves from destitution. These women, just mere months ago, would have never thought they would ever have to barter sex to survive. Things change so quickly, and the safety nets that we feel give us so much security are quickly torn asunder when the underpinnings of civilization are destabilized. Despite Mathieu\u2019s best efforts, his group is betrayed. What makes this book interesting is Alan Furst\u2019s focus on the unexpected pressures that exist for Mathieu. It isn\u2019t enough that he is risking his life and the lives of the people in his resistance group, but he also has to deal with the politics of his own \u201callies,\u201d find enough money to keep in operation, and deal with blackmailers and gangs who are trying to muscle into his operation. The tenuousness of his position keeps the reader wondering when he will drop one of those numerous red balls he is trying to keep up in the air. \n  I\u2019ve had a long reading relationship with Alan Furst. I\u2019ve even met the man, and he was as elegant and dapper as one of the men he writes about. I\u2019ve read almost all of his Night Soldiers books. This is the 14th in the series. There are books in the series that could easily qualify as literature, but some fall more under the heading of, as Graham Greene called some of his own books, \u201cEntertainments.\u201d Regardless of how these books should be designated, I have to say, as always, I was captivated and intrigued and will always look forward with anticipation to the next Alan Furst book.

Never before have I been so fully let down by a (used-to-be) favorite author. Night Soldiers blew me away as probably the most elegant, dark, subtle, historically detailed, and intellectual \"spy\" novel I'd ever encountered (I don't even like to describe it as a \"spy\" thriller because Night Soldiers is not genre fiction, but absolutely brilliant noir-historical WW2 literary fiction). I've read some others in the series, and loved them all (the last was #9, The Foreign Correspondent).I couldn't believe this book was written by Furst; some developments from #1 to #14:* all nuance has been obliterated in favor of simplistic moralizing and reeking explicitness* lyrical, well composed prose has given way to a direct, factual-reporting style* sex and nudity have been shoved in for purposes of titillation only, in ways that add nothing to the plot or characterizations* the realistic gritty-noir moody tone has been replaced by that of a commercial, superficial action-thriller One dimension I was not disappointed by was Furst's attention to historical detail and portrayal of aspects of WW2 I don't read much about in fiction (in this installment, the story is about the French resistance movement which helped stranded British pilots make it back to GB through an 'underground railroad' network). For the history lesson, one additional star.I received my copy of this book through the publisher via Netgalley.

'A Hero of France' is #14 in Furst's 'Night Soldiers' series. 'A Hero of France' is basically the tale of a small cell of French Resistance fighters in Paris, France and the French countryside who operate to return downed RAF pilots back to England to continue their work in the war. This book takes place through the early stage of Barbarossa, just as Nazi Germany invades Russia and ends right around the time the Gestapo enter France to combat the rising activities of the French Resistance. I view the whole series as a giant canvas that allows Furst to paint the struggles and quiet heroism of those who battled Fascism in a variety of minor and major ways. These aren't books too concerned with the battles of WWII. These look at how villages, villagers, citizens, and spies in the Balkans, France, Eastern Europe, etc., fought against the rising tide of Fascism.I've read ALL of his 'Night Soldiers' series. I only say that because lately, I've been reading these novels with some trepidation. It isn't that they aren't good anymore. 'A Hero of France' is just fine. It has interesting characters, fantastic details, a clean story. But the last three of his novels, this one included just seem average (OK, so perhaps they are barely fine). They all feel a bit phoned-in. I remember I started Furst with book 12 (Mission to Paris), and felt a bit let down too. Perhaps, it all goes back to Furst getting a bit lazy with his Paris books. I don't know. All I can say is I wasn't thrilled with this one. For reference, I've included below the 14 books of the Night Soldiers series along with my star rating:  1.

As usual Furst does not reach for entertaining thrills or romanticism in his plotting. Historical fiction tends to diverge between elucidating historical events with characters as in a stage play and stories that focus on characters with the historical events as a backdrop. Furst\u2019s work lies exactly at the intersection of the approaches. His atmospherics always enchant me with the sense of being transported by a time machine. He continually comes to this pivotal period in the early 40s when the future of civilized humanity as represented by France was in doubt from the apparently total success of the conquering Nazis. Usually Furst builds his resistance stories from the perspective of non-French characters and settings (e.g. Poles, Bulgarians, Dutch) with plots that end up with a focus on activities within France and interactions with the French. Here his main character, Leveque (under the nom de guerre Matthieu), is French, but a lot of the personal stories concern the British RAF crewmen downed in France on bombing runs to Germany. Matthieu is a businessman who develops his own clandestine network of citizens who work to get the airmen out of France and back to their valuable service in fighting the war. He had experience as captain of a tank crew in the brief but hopeless opposition to the invasion in 1940, but his essential talent is less in military skills than in recruiting people to his efforts and reading who is trustworthy. His \u201cteam\u201d includes a colorful collection of people, e.g. a professor of anthropology, a Ukrainian Jewish nightclub owner and gangster, a bourgeois widow, a spiritualist shop owner, a teenaged girl, and a Macedonian smuggler. As you can imagine, the work to get the airmen out by boat or over the mountains to Spain calls for safe hiding places, forged identity documents and travel papers, clothing and disguises, couriers for messaging, escorts for guidance and deceptive cover, means of transportation, and lots of money to pay for these things and for bribery of nosy officials. Mathieu leads these efforts in a low-key manner founded on the human warmth in his relations with his people. An ongoing love affair with a woman ignorant of his secret life sustains his own personal balance in the face of all the risks of discovery of his schemes. His main adversary, Otto Broehm, is a German police inspector reassigned from Hamburg to Paris to stop the successful Resistance help to the British war effort. He is very human and not a Nazi, but he is very effective in applying leverage on people to spy on Mathieu\u2019s operations. The challenges and stakes get higher when the British engage Matthieu\u2019s help in getting some of more important airmen out by seaplane and in facilitating the entry and work of sabotage agents from the exiled French in Britain. All this made for a fascinating and satisfying read, one with more action than Furst\u2019s usual tales.This book was provided for review by the publisher through the Netgalley program (publication date is May 31)."}, {"userName": "Renata", "userReviewDate": "Feb 22, 2018", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/697616-renata", "userReview": "Alan First has carved out a niche for himself in writing historical thrillers set throughout Europe during WWII.

It is centered around a Frenchman with the nom de guerre \u201cMathieu\u201d who has cast off the trappings of his previous life in Paris to join the ranks of the Resistance. Mathieu is in his early 40s, fairly fit, resourceful, tough, determined, yet not without charm and a knack for making friends in the most interesting places. Unlike most French people, who at this stage of the war (the novel begins in a wintry, melancholic Paris in March 1941) were largely resigned to the defeat France had suffered at the hands of the Third Reich in June 1940, Mathieu is determined to fight the Germans any way he can. To this end, he has been part of a network that has formed a pipeline between the Occupied Zone and Vichy France, spiriting downed RAF (Royal Air Force) flyers out of France into Spain, where they would be repatriated back to the UK. Resistance activities had started off on a very small scale from late 1940. But as the months wore on, the Germans began to show their impatience and frustration from their efforts to discourage random acts of vandalism, the occasional murder of a German officer, and sabotage. Thus, a police inspector from Hamburg was enlisted by Berlin to go to Paris (as a temporary major in the Feldgendarmerie, the German Army Military Police) and see what he could do to break up the Resistance pipeline of which Mathieu is an instrumental part. What I like about an Alan Furst novel is his knack for evoking the atmosphere of German-occupied Europe and creating a set of characters who struggle to survive, endure, and fight the Nazi yoke. Anyone who wants to lose him/herself in a taut, well-told story rich with cinematic overtones, look no further. \u201cA HERO IN FRANCE\u201d is the novel for you."}, {"userName": "Liviu", "userReviewDate": "Mar 13, 2016", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/1229019-liviu", "userReview": "The 14th novel in the loose Night Soldiers series After the ok'ish but not quite top of the line Midnight in Europe, Alan Furst returns to France (which is the setting of a majority of his Night Soldiers books, while featuring in almost all) and delivers an excellent novel and a return to form. While it is billed as his first novel set during WW 2 proper - as usually his books in the loose series ended when the war started or immediately after in 1939, though there were exceptions that kept the action going for a few years during the war as well as generally noting the fate of the main characters in an epilogue in 1945-46 - A Hero of France has most of the characteristics of the others as it takes place in a few months period from March till June 1941 in France where the war has actually ended with the catastrophic defeat of 1940 and the division of the country between the Northern Occupied part and the Southern Vichy Regime similarly to most his other books we mainly follow \"Mathieu\", a single attractive Parisian man in his early forties, former tank commander for a very short time in the war and presumably of some position in society (without too many spoilers we actually find out his actual identity in the epilogue) who runs a proto-Resistance cell dedicated to smuggling downed English airmen from the RAF raids to Germany which go over France to the Vichy France where the authorities turn a blind eye to them and let them go back to England through neutral Spain; obviously the Germans are very annoyed about this and they try to destroy these cells in Paris and the rest of occupied France, but for the moment they are somewhat hampered by the Fuhrer's desire to woo the French on his side, so the German authorities tend to use mostly regular Police and their French counterparts and stay within the law as it is, rather than unleash the Gestapo and the SD and their terrorist tacticsin particular while the life of the cells tends to be about six months as an English high class operative cynically puts it to Mathieu (who with his Sorbonne past takes a cordial dislike to the Oxbridge aristocrat at first glance) at some point when he tries to buy Mathieu's cell with lots of cash and expand the resistance to deadlier (and obviously considerably riskier) goals, even if arrested the people of the cells tend to be tried under French law for relatively minor offenses like people smuggling rather than treason and with enough cash, stay in in local prisons for the usual year or two upon conviction, while the English airmen are taken to German POW camps where they are treated decently;but there are ominous signs pointing to change as the increased number of informers and money rewards for turning in English airmen, the more and more obvious reluctance of the French authorities in both occupied France and Vichy to help or at least turn a blind eye can signal a turn of the somewhat civilized business of resistance to a brutal, take no prisoners one; and obviously waiting on the side the deep Soviet run cells which are notorious for their brutal methods (and to whom Mathieu also has a somewhat unwitting connection) in France are preparing for action as the relations between the Nazis and the soviets are deteriorating visibly...And so it goes, with the aforementioned usual elements - including the love interest, a few recurrent secondary characters, the usual recounting of the Bulgarian waiter incident (told in the Night Soldiers novel which opened the series many years ago but recounted in most novels as a sort of \"grounding place\"), the intrigue, the moments of action and the rising tension as stakes grow higher and higher, while discovery becomes seemingly unavoidable...A great ending and the expected epilogue round an excellent novel in the usual style of Alan Furstoverall, highly recommended as a return to form for the author and one of the best entries in the loose Night Soldier series"}, {"userName": "Keith Currie", "userReviewDate": "Jun 03, 2016", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/18082549-keith-currie", "userReview": "I was once a fan of Alan Furst\u2019s novels \u2013 the sequence right up to and including Dark Voyage are individual masterpieces of intrigue, suspense and menace set throughout Europe in a frightening period. The Polish Officer and Dark Star are among my favourite novels of all time. With Spies of Warsaw I began to feel that the formula was becoming tired and routine. The novels became shorter, the plots more perfunctory and episodic \u2013 as though the author was writing them while doing something else more interesting at the time.A Hero in France is not bad. It reads like a fictional primer of the origins of the French Resistance to German occupation. The characters have potential and individual episodes read well. But there is a strong and repeated element of clich\u00e9 and worse, all the strands tie up far too neatly. It was as though the author no longer really cared about producing a work that challenged the reader - that showed that not everything in such terrible times could turn out well.

He's good at sizing up people, figuring out if they can be trusted. \"And I'd better be,'' he says, ''because I can only be wrong once.''Mathieu is the capable leader of a small Resistance cell in A Hero of France (Random House, digital galley), Furst's excellent new novel of the shadowy world of espionage. In previous books, he has focused mostly on the twilight years leading up to the war, but here it is March of 1941, and German-occupied Paris is dark and under curfew. Mathieu and his cell help rescue downed RAF pilots and crew members, hiding them in safe houses, securing false identity passes, providing disguises and escorting them to safety -- perhaps by train through Vichy France and then to Spain, or in the back of a truck to the countryside and coast to await safe passage to England. It is dangerous, heart-stopping work, but these ordinary people -- a professor, a nurse, a schoolteacher, a teen with a bicycle, a widow with a bureaucratic friend, a nightclub owner with connections -- prove themselves over and over in extraordinary circumstances. But their actions can only go unnoticed for so long. A fatuous Brit wants to run the network from afar, encouraging riskier acts of sabotage. A German police detective is looking for an informer to penetrate the cell. Then there are the soldiers who will trip a man for no reason, and young street thugs playing at extortion.The narrative is episodic, and Furst splices tense, action-filled scenes with interludes of relative calm. Mathieu begins a love affair with a neighbor, and adopts -- or is adopted by -- a Belgian shepherd dog. The writing is atmospheric: a crippled plane tries to land in silvery moonlight, lovers share secrets behind blackout curtains, a cafe owner shrugs when asked about the Resistance. \"Monsieur, do you know what goes on in the cafes of Paris? Everything. Of course, one may have a glass of wine, a coffee, and something to eat, but there is more. Love affairs begin, love affairs end, swindlers meet their victims, victims meet their lawyers.

Overall however, I really enjoyed this installment in the series.Furst\u2019s knowledge of Paris and the other areas of France is very apparent in his writing. His descriptions of daily life in France, particularly Occupied Paris in 1941 and 1942, transported me straight to that time period. The main character of the novel goes by \u201cMathieu\u201d when operating as the leader of a French Resistance cell that manages to extract a large number of downed British pilots and other Nazi enemies during World War 2. I found it fascinating to learn how the Resistance workers outsmarted the Nazis amid blackouts, curfews, informants and food shortages that taxed the French population. Danger literally could be found on any street corner, and the courage, sacrifice and strength of the Resistance workers, particularly Mathieu, was without limit.The politics of the time period are included as part of the story in such a manner that I gained a better understanding of the time period and the various forces at work during the middle parts of the war but in an interesting manner.

This is about the very few heroes that were left in France after its fall in 1940 who helped the allied war effort by placing their lives in danger by running escape lines for downed airman from the RAF. While the majority did nothing but look the other way, while civil servants and police collaborated along with the Vichy Government, with the Nazis.It is spring 1941, Britain seems to be losing the war and Paris is occupied by the Nazis while Marshall Petin is running the Vichy Government that is collaborating with the Nazi invaders. Paris is under curfew and the blackout is in place so as not to help the British bombers on their way to bomb Germany. When night time arrives, the leader of a small resistance cell, Mattieu, begins his work with a few trusted colleagues.Smuggling airman along escape lines to Spain so that they can get back to Britain, needs a team that can be relied upon not to talk out of turn. The Vichy agents are not really trying to stop them but they will if the opportunity arises and make their German allies happy. Too many are escaping and the German\u2019s are not happy, and they send one of their own to plan to capture and shut down these escape routes.Mattieu and his cell also work with the British SOE getting agents in to France so that they made things more difficult for the Germans. But when Mattieu is informed against and made the subject of a man hunt, he and his team know that they have to get away before they end up in the hands of the Germans and the Gestapo. It still does not stop their work, which they started, but the ineptness of the Nazi collaborators may just be the saving grace.A Hero in France is an excellent espionage thriller, which shows the excellence of Furst\u2019s research and writing and getting under the skin of the very few that did work against the occupation.

You will also notice that I always comment on his writing style. There is just something off/odd/different about the way he writes that always makes me think I am reading a translation. Perhaps it adds to the atmosphere of the stories since they take place in Europe pre and post WWII. In any case, in the novels I liked, I eventually get lost in the story, plot, characters and my attention to the actually writing fades into the background. In this one it didn't - in fact I felt that his style acted as a barrier and I could not immerse myself in the story. But I also think this was a particularly weak story with cardboard characters. It was almost like vignettes -moments - instead of one story. There were so many loose ends and characters/scenes that added nothing to the narrative. I kept waiting for MORE.Also I got so tired/bored with the sex scenes. I know the main character is male and the author is male but really some of the scenes seemed awkward - again a style issue? Perhaps they were supposed to come off worldly and/or sophisticated or 'french'? But to me they often read as a guy's fantasy. Especially the scene were Mathieu (main character) and Chantal are watching a nude sunbather (woman) - of course Mathieu is turned on by the view (and activities) and is more turned because -holy male sex fantasy jackpot - so is Chantal!!

Paris and the shambles of the Occupation by German forces is described in poetic detail as well as the Vichy government that rules the Southern reaches of this desecrated country.

Dark Star Was my first happy discovery, which led me to go to the beginning and read -- no, devour -- the entire Night Soldiers series. I found myself carried along by the beautiful use of language, the imagery, the suspense, the characters, even the wonderful humor: the description of the \"loud Gypsy orchestra with copious gypsies\" in Blood of Victory still makes me laugh out loud.How very disappointed I am with this book. What happened? Where are all the wonderful elements that made these books so excellent? I can only think that Mr. Furst has tired of the series.

This story takes place in 1941 Paris when Mathieu, a leader of the occupation, leads one Resistance cell by helping downed British airmen escape back to England.Alan Furst captures this dangerous time incredibly well. Mathieu and the Resistance members risk their lives to fulfill their missions. These include Lisette, a 17 year old student, Max de Lyon, a wealthy arms dealer to nightclub owner, Chantal, a woman of class held with much confidence in the cell, Daniel, a Jewish teacher filled with revenge, Annemarie, an aristocrat, and Joelle who loves Mathieu. They work together until the German military police ordered by the Reich threatens them. They finally disband and end the missions.Furst is a highly recommended author of espionage thrillers."}, {"userName": "Jeremy Hornik", "userReviewDate": "Apr 13, 2017", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/3559859-jeremy-hornik", "userReview": "Alan Furst, mmm.

The five and four star reviews are considered \"positive\", while the one, two, and three star reviews are considered \"Critical\". And there's a real problem for Amazon reviewers who would like to use a three-stars as \"not bad but not good\". A three star review should be considered \"neutral\", but it isn't. There are books that I would like to use that designation but I can't, so I have to write a nuanced-enough 3-star review to state that the book is \"okay\". I'm rating Alan Furst's new book, \"A Hero of France\" as three stars, and will try to explain why.\"A Hero of France\" is set in France, mostly in Paris, but also in other cities and the countryside. The time is spring and summer 1941, after the German victory over the French and the occupation of most of the country. This time is before the German invasion of the Soviet Union and the Germans have the upper hand in western European countries. The United States hasn't entered the war; that'll happen in December 1941 and things are still pretty bleak for occupied France. There are resistance units operating in France, and it's these brave men and women who carry on the silent war against the Germans. They smuggle out downed Allied fliers to safety and are beginning to sabotage German holdings. Alan Furst's characters in the resistance are given back stories that complement the work they're doing, and a lot of work is certainly being done, but the book never quite gels. The characters are \"there\" and they're doing things, and they're traveling all over France, and they're hiding from the German occupiers and the French police, but there's just very little substance to the book. The characters - despite their back-stories - remain caricatures.Here's where the 3 star- \"neutral\" rating comes in. IF you are a Furst fan, his latest book might just satisfy you. There's the requisite visit to the Brasserie Heininger and some other familiar things. IF you are a first time Furst reader, you'll probably find the book lacking in substance. So a three star rating is my averaging of two and four star ratings. It's a book you probably won't remember in a month."}, {"userName": "Yvonne", "userReviewDate": "Jun 13, 2016", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/11499015-yvonne", "userReview": "At 234 pages Alan Furst\u2019s \u201cA Hero of France\u201d is a quick read. Not only because of its length but also because it is Alan Furst Light. Although better than his previous two books, \u201cMission to Paris\u201d and \u201cMidnight in Europe\u201d those of us who are fans and have read all of Mr. Furst\u2019s novels, know what he is capable of producing and will be let down. Besides magisterially researched books Mr. Furst can sometimes write phrases that are downright poetic. Those are missing. I\u2019m afraid that when authors start cranking out a book a year, they lose some of the passion and the quality. This has happened to Mr. Furst. Although his research is impeccable and the settings and ambiance are wonderful and he can still transport you to German-occupied Paris, the plot was both short and thin. One of the characters is a dog. Yes, Mariana the dog. Incredibly we are given her Point of View (POV) \u201cMariana knew better and, now on guard for her sleeping master, settled on the threshold in front of the door.\u201d How does Mr. Furst know what is in the head of a dog? I found this annoying.Then there was this repetition that a Random House editor should have caught. Page 132 \u201ca thin, sour woman who wore eyeglasses attached to a chain around her neck.\u201d Pg 174 \u201ca thin sour woman who wore eyeglasses attached to a chain around her neck.\u201d And do we have to read again about the mirror that bore a bullet hole at Brasserie Heininger? A cute bit of trivia but it\u2019s mentioned in every book that takes place in Paris.I will keep reading Alan Furst\u2019s books although I hope he takes a year off, charges his creative batteries and comes back giving us the magnificent Alan Furst of his first novels."}, {"userName": "Dick Reynolds", "userReviewDate": "Feb 20, 2016", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/10283403-dick-reynolds", "userReview": "I won a copy of the Advance Reader\u2019s Edition in a Goodreads giveaway.\tIt\u2019s early 1941 in occupied Paris where protagonist Mathieu is running a covert operation as part of the French Resistance.

I\u2019d always thought that such resistance would involve sabotage but author Alan Furst notes that those missions would occur later after the agents acquired more training and equipment.\tMathieu and his cohorts are in constant danger of discovery and being shipped off to a German prison.

He conjures up a very credible picture of France under German occupation in WW2 and the heroism of those who helped hide Allied aircrew who had been shot down. The brutality of the Gestapo is alluded to but not described in detail. The role of the French police is examined.In the 1980s I worked for some time in France and was aware that some of the scars from the war were still raw. The firms that collaborated with the Nazis - the mayor who allegedly betrayed the town's doctor in return for a car (he survived a term in a concentration camp but never forgave ) - these were some of the stories one heard. The author summons up a divided society with skill.I do not think this book is great literature. The characters have an element of 'cut and paste ' about them - worthy young aviators, buxom can-can dancers and a night club owner who looks like a gangster but has a heart of gold. This did not bother me unduly. There were real aviators who emerged from burning planes who needed help and got it. There were civilians who risked life and limb to do the right thing and there were those who took German money to betray the Resistants. That material is rich enough for me."}, {"userName": "Dana West", "userReviewDate": "Jun 05, 2017", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/2187498-dana-west", "userReview": "I struggled with this book.
