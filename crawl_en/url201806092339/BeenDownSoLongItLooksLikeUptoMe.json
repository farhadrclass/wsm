And then, during the year's last handful of blessedly slow days at the Crappiest Place on Earth, I discovered that actually taking my lunch hour to hunker shoelessly down in the backseat of my car with a blanket and a book is pretty much the best thing to ever happen to my sanity professional life. Observe the photographic proof of my sublime on-the-clock refuge:\n(Thank bouncing Baby Jesus that Fari\u00f1a's Cornell chum desensitized me to complex equations interrupting literature.)So now a novel that was published two days before its author's far-too-early death has found an even fonder association in my own personal landscape, thanks to my unyielding dissatisfaction with and need to escape from a job that takes me farther and farther from where I wanted to be at this point in my life. I am so glad that I read this book now, rather than as a starry-eyed undergrad with dreams of running the NYT and writing The Greatest American Novel of My Generation on the side. I have a better sense of how life is not something that can be planned for, that growing up is fucking hard even with a willingness to let one's inner child have a say every now and again, that death is always lurking around every corner, and coming to this novel without even one of those hard lessons under my belt would have reduced this from a poignantly frenzied love song of youth's last discoveries to an instruction manual for college kids who just want to shake things up (not that there's anything inherently wrong with living in the moment and taking inconsequentially stupid chances, for those are the backbone of the best Hey, Remember When...? tales). I absolutely would have embraced any opportunity to cause a scene at a formal frathouse dinner like Gnossos Pappadopoulis (Fari\u00f1a's thinly veiled stand-in for himself) did, just as I had also proclaimed myself in love with wrong guy after wrong guy based on a series of limited-engagement liaisons, as Gnossos did with Kristin, his obsession in green knee-socks and loafers.My tendency to relate too personally with literary characters came out to play for keeps as Gnossos became a clearer and clearer picture; save for a few lapses into first-person narration, this is a story told mostly in third-person with a focus on GP, so it takes some time to get a sense of his motivation and how others perceive him (it takes a little longer to reconcile the two seemingly at-odds realities). And perhaps I was imposing my own inner workings on Gnossos but I left this book with a sense of awed kinship inspired by his mostly successful attempts to hide his soft heart under an ornery facade. He wants to feel, he wants to live, he wants to be earnest in his devil-may-care approach to throwing himself into living but he is woefully, painfully afraid of doing so because fully embracing life means also acknowledging that death is the inevitable end game.Gnossos seems like the kind of maniac ringleader whose enthusiasm and passion attract unresisting friends and followers in droves but his attitude obscures a desperate desire to fall in love rather than indulge in a series of unemotional physical encounters, which is what it seems will finally help him stop fighting thanathos with an unequivocally driving life force. Had I not read Pynchon's \"Entropy\" in college, I would have probably missed the significance of how Gnossos has hermetically sealed himself inside every room he occupies in an attempt to artificially preserve life against the natural encroachment of death -- until his night with Kristin has him throwing open windows with the zeal of a man possessed. He is a character who fights the unpleasant reality with the much more pleasing act of losing oneself in the moment and clinging to that happiness as if that's all it takes to preserve that joy for eternity. As his attempts at pleasant stasis become more desperate and he loses control over situations that initially plopped him on top of the world, it becomes more obvious that this is a guy who wants freedom without responsibility -- and, in the end, isn't that what college is all about?It's Bukowski once you've swapped the booze for drugs. It's Hunter S. Thompson with an overt awareness that death is nipping at his heels. It's Kerouac as a college kid. It's Pynchon with narrative restraint. But most of all, it's both proof that Fari\u00f1a's early death was a huge loss to the literary world and a tribute to a screamingly talented artist who knew how to find the biggest truths in the smallest moments while laughing and kicking death in the ass. Because as much as Gnossos (and, presumably, Fari\u00f1a) feared death, his ability to suck the marrow from every moment is the ultimate victory of life."}, {"userName": "Paul Bryant", "userReviewDate": "May 22, 2017", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/416390-paul-bryant", "userReview": "Smirky superior hectoring hipster cultivates cringemaking condescension, bullying braggadocio and sexual sneering in wearisome war on straight society.

If I could model my life after his I would - all except the dying in a motorcycle accident two days after my first novel is published. But besides this I would like to:1. release acoustic driven music with my beautiful girlfriend/wife2. Publish a novel centered around a smooth-talking, fast-living, drug-ingesting protagonist named Gnossos (yes, that's right his name is Gnossos and you don't even wanna know his last name)3. Participate in campus demonstrations against draconian campus policies.and 4. Be Thomas Pynchon's best friend and have Gravity's Rainbow dedicated to me; I mean how fuckin' cool would that be.But all personal coolness aside, \"Been Down So Long..\" is actually a good novel. While a bit dated (as this was written in the sixties), and a bit misogynistic (he lies about using a contraceptive just so he can get some), the novel is buzzing in style, dripping in a sixties coolness and an extemporaneous desire for change. Gnossos, while sometimes loathsome, is also entertaining to be around. This is not a novel I would recommend to most women; they might like it if they are into Bukowski or something similar, but most probably will not. I think I like the novel more than I think it is actually good. When I picked it up the title struck me as something so modern, like the title of some indie rock band's second album, and when I read the first chapter it was written with such verve and humour that it immediately had me hooked. More so than that the ending threw me for a loop and showed me that this was more than an \"On The Road\" wanderlust excuse to drink and take drugs (although there is a rather large element of that) But more so it was about the effects of trying to maintain a detached cool in the midst of so much cultural change; and even more universal than that, it's about trying to go through life and never be embarrased or made foolish, and only portray the most laid-back, witty, and insouciant calm that no real person actually has. And, of course, anyone who drinks, takes drugs, lies and sleeps around is the complete opposite of these things; he's an insecure man who has been down so long that it starts looking like up."}, {"userName": "Oriana", "userReviewDate": "Aug 17, 2007", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/30800-oriana", "userReview": "before Picking this up seems like a very logical progression from Stone Junction: both mystical journeys, both introduced by Thomas Pynchon, both books I remember loving a decade ago but don't really remember. I'm a little nervous re-reading this, because it shines in my mind as one of the best things I ever read, and I certainly don't want to prove that untrue. But I'm sure it's as amazing as I remember it, right? Right????after Spoiler: wrong.This past summer I went to a \"Summer of Love\" exhibit at MoMA. Let me just make it clear that I was raised by hippies and even lived on a hippie farm for the first few years of my life; Grateful Dead was my favorite band until I was 13, and I still compost every single carrot peel and eggshell, even though it means schlepping a gross drippy bag of rotting fruit bits on the subway twice a week. So yeah, I obviously went to the \"Summer of Love\" exhibit at MoMA with very high hopes.Turned out I actually found it really confusing and depressing. Not because the art was bad; it was great. But all the \"trippy\" neon and psychedelic tie-dye and black-lit swirls just felt so silly to me, so overdone and clich\u00e9d and kind of pathetic. But here's the thing: none of that stuff was clich\u00e9d. It's just that every freaking thing that's been done since ripped it off, reducing and devaluing it all by sheer oversaturation into something cloying and mass marketed and hokey. And so it is with Been Down So Long It Looks Like Up to Me. I know that in the '50s when this was written, the jargon, the attire, the struggles and quests were groundbreaking and awe-inspiring and amazing. But now... it's just been copied ad nauseum, more and more reductively and simplistically each time, by so many awful wannabes, that the whole thing feels stale, a little clunky, a little sad. And so oh la. This is still an amazing book, but in a crushing blow I've had to demote it from my \"perennial favorites\" shelf to \"formative reading.\" I mean, this book had a dramatic effect on me as a teenager, but -- though it grieves me to admit -- it just didn't blow my mind as a semi-adult. For those who've never read it, it's absolutely worth a look, as long as you're prepared to be kind to it, and meet it on its own terms: serious psychedelica, spirit quests, campus unrest, an inevitable road trip to Cuba, and lots and lots and lots of drugs."}, {"userName": "Kirk", "userReviewDate": "Dec 04, 2010", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/667059-kirk", "userReview": "Well, if you ever want proof of how sixties totems don't really age well, this is the book for you. The cult following has been long if somewhat subterranean, its duration due in part to the unfortunate circumstance of its author dying in a motorcycle accident only a couple dozen hours after its publication (and only a few months before the mythological motorcycle accident of Farina's \"brother-in-law,\" Bob Dylan). It also helps your literary endurance to have gone to Cornell with both Thomas Pynchon and C. Michael Curtis of Atlantic Monthly fame. Readers will be forgiven for wondering, in fact, if Pynchon didn't have a hand in the book since its manic energy and style are simpatico to both V and The Crying of Lot 49. When I first read this the summer before I went to college (right after the edition with Farina's face on it came out---the new edition with the upside down crotch shot doesn't do much to sell the legend) there were even rumors that Pynchon WAS Farina, or Farina WAS Pynchon. Or something like that. In the end, reading the book is a lot like watching WILD IN THE STREETS or maybe even VILLAGE OF THE GIANTS (best scene: http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zy40TT... thanks, MST3K): it's best enjoyed with tongue in cheek. Maybe in the end the important thing this book documents is how the youth rebellion associated with the sixties had a hard time rising about juvenility. (Suffice to say that a moral stand in this plot revolves around flipping off the evil campus VP). All that said, you can still watch clips of the Berkeley Free Speech days and appreciate why aggressive generational politics was necessary back in the day: old people really acted like mean old people before 1966. Nobody above 25 gave two shits about being cool or hip. So the book really captures the late 50s period when weed, premarital sex, and long hair were indeed considered threats to the social order. That makes for an interesting if not always sympathetic document. As many commentators have remarked, rebellion here is a boys club---you can draw a straight line from the humor to Animal House and realize frattiness was in the blood even if you were vehemently anti-frat. Anyway, worth a gander for nostalgia's sake. Farina's musical career is actually more emotionally engaging if you aren't put off by the sort of folk music that prefers dulcimers to acoustic blues noodling and has titles like \"Reflections in a Crystal Wind.\" Personally, I dig it, baby. RF's wife was the gorgeous and highly underestimated Mimi Farina (Joan baez's kid sister). She survived her husband by thirty-five years but still died way too young, nearly a decade ago now."}, {"userName": "Trish", "userReviewDate": "Jul 29, 2016", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/1826682-trish", "userReview": "When I read that Pynchon was best buds with Fari\u00f1a and that this novel had a setting at Cornell, I was interested.

Farina was a successful folk musician, playing with his wife Mimi Baez and touring with Bob Dylan and her sister Joan in the 60s. The Cuban-Irish author was also a published poet, and wasn't known for his fiction until this novel, his first and last. Three days after its publication, Farina was killed in a motorcycle crash.This novel stands on its own even without the coincidental pedigree of its author (friends with Pynchon at Cornell). Essentially a 60s campus novel set at a veiled Cornell in the 50s, our perspective is a unique third-person limited omniscience written in the same tone and voice of the protagonist, Greek itinerant Gnossos Pappadopolis. There's a level of farcical allusion and playful lyricism that put off many readers, but rewards close reading. It allows Farina to encapsulate a wide range of topics without appearing false: the youthful hubris of immortality, here called Immunity; the naive spirit of protest and general counterculture billowing on campuses nationwide in the Age of Aquarius; the outside world, a place of spurious rules and authority figures best ignored as long as possible; and even, despite the protective bubble of the college setting, real consequence and sadness. Farina tackles almost every American issue in this beguiling text, all through the eyes of one of Kerouac's \"mad ones.\" Of course, the bubble of Immunity pops in the end, grounding the book in a reality all too familiar for 60s children. The journey there, with its unforgettable characters and set pieces (and that language!), is one I take at least once every year."}, {"userName": "Paul Secor", "userReviewDate": "Sep 30, 2014", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/5737008-paul-secor", "userReview": "I read this in the late sixties and wasn't impressed back then.

Though the word frenzy might suggest speed, it took Richard Fari\u00f1a over five years to write this book. Sometimes I think that all would be revealed if I got high before reading it, sort of like getting high before a Grateful Dead concert. God knows it drags when you're straight and sober.The main character, Gnossos Pappadopoulis, has long been cited as the missing link between the beatniks and the hippies. He evolves from beatnik into the original, archetypal hippie. He set out on the road and found nothing but did find the keys to inner enlightenment in the form of hallucinogenic drugs. Whereas the beatniks used drugs to escape reality the hippies used them to transcend reality. But in the end it all amounts to the same thing.Although it was set in early in 1958 at Cornell, it wasn't published until the spring of 1966. Fari\u00f1a was ahead of his time and probably couldn't have gotten the book published before that, but the times were changing and rapidly catching up with him. But by the time the world had caught up with him, he was gone, killed in a motorcycle accident two days after the book was published.His death only contributed to the cult status that the book would achieve, heralded as it was as being the Catcher in the Rye or On the Road of that decade. It might have been different--no, it would have been different if Fari\u00f1a had lived to write again. In retrospect it would have been a first novel that merely showed promise rather than the voice of a unrealized genius snuffed out in the prime of life. Like James Dean dying at 25 after having made only three movies rather than growing old and bloated like Brando. Fari\u00f1a is the James Dean of literature, he will always be young and good looking."}, {"userName": "Neil", "userReviewDate": "Mar 07, 2017", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/33119635-neil", "userReview": "Like, I imagine, many people who read this book, I picked it up because Thomas Pynchon dedicated Gravity\u2019s Rainbow to its author and, when I looked him up on the Internet, it seemed he was an interesting character and it might be worth reading a book by him. The fact that this was his first novel and that he was killed in a motorcycle accident just two days after its publication just adds to the mystery and myth that surrounds Farina.But, if truth be told, this book has little to recommend it to anyone other than students of the Sixties. The book cover states: Richard Farina evokes the Sixties as precisely, wittily and poignantly as F. Scott Fitzgerald captured the Jazz Age\u201d. That might well be the case (I was only 5 years old when the book was published and only 9 years old when the Sixties turned into the Seventies, so I can\u2019t really comment), although somehow I doubt it: the writing isn\u2019t great (I cannot see how some people came up with a theory that Farina and Pynchon are/were the same person) and the story isn\u2019t actually all that interesting.Interestingly, the book cover also says the book as Thomas Pynchon writes in the introduction, \"comes on like the Hallelujah Chorus done by 200 kazoo players with perfect pitch.\" I\u2019ve read the introduction twice including once as a web version I found where I could use the text search option, and I can tell you he doesn\u2019t say that (I believe he may have said it on the dust jacket of one edition, but certainly not in the introduction included in this edition).So, not a complete waste of time (the section with the wolf story redeems it a bit), but 1.5 stars rounded up to 2."}, {"userName": "Lindsey", "userReviewDate": "Apr 04, 2011", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/1812474-lindsey", "userReview": "After attending a book signing party for \"Been Down So Long...\" Richard Farina climbed onto a guest's motorcycle to attend his wife's birthday party, but he was killed in an accident before arriving. Though his wife had been upset with him at the signing because he had failed to get her a present, she returned home days after his death to find the apart they had shared filled with flowers he'd arranged to have delivered. Much like these forgotten blooms, Farina's sole novel should be considered precious. Friends of Thomas Pynchon and Bob Dylan, a patron of the White Horse and protest folk singer, married to Joan Baez's sister, Farina was entrenched in 1960's New York bohemian and beat scene. It is this that lends a certain authenticity to his caricature as character, Gnossos Pappadopoulis. Gnossos is a controversial, bombastic, drug-addled dreamer, hip to the point of modern myth amongst his peers and at the same time, utterly peerless. He becomes entangled with political protest groups, dope pushers, spacey neighbors, and one certain femme fatale, and Farina takes us along for the ride. The result is a comic trip and shimmering, secret, psychedelic gem. Not as well known as the work of Farina's counterparts, \"Been Down So Long\" waits patiently to be discovered, much like the blossoms he'd seemingly sent to Mimi from beyond the grave. It is by turns outrageous and brilliant, and Gnossos is as frustrating and awful as he is lovable, surrounded by a cast of mad geniuses and impassioned coeds. While \"Been Down So Long\" is written in a very specific setting, the larger picture it creates is one of youth desperately searching for meaning in a possibly random world. Of course, it is not the only novel to explore this, but it deserves a place alongside the greatest of its ilk. It's hard to say what Farina might have added to his legacy had he not met his end so prematurely, but if \"Been Down\" is a true indicator of his talent, it makes his passing all the more tragic."}, {"userName": "John", "userReviewDate": "Jun 11, 2008", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/671726-john", "userReview": "I am convinced that Farina could have become a really good novelist. However, his first and only outing has many shortcomings. Farina has a very unique writing style, not unlike Pynchon, except whereas Pynchon writes about rockets and science, Farina writes about drugs, women, and Greek food. He has an entertaining shwagger in his writing style, but I constantly felt that parts and stylings were contrived and awkward. He tries too hard appealing to ambiguity, and it leaves a lot of plot confusion and needless amorphous flourishes. I often would have to go back and reread chapters because I wasn't aware 'Motherball' was a person. Another flaw involves character development; I had little clue who the characters were outside of Gnossos.The story errs on the hollow side, not much of importance happens outside of drinking and drug experimentation, and in turn I felt emotionally apathetic to all the characters. The death of Heffalump momentarily introduces a serious tone into the novel, but ultimately goes awry when I realized I had very little notion of who Heffalump was to begin with. Mostly the book centers around Gnossos social interactions, drinking, and penchant for speaking in references and slang. I still dont know; did people really talk like this in the 60's? I think I would recommend this to someone who has exhausted Kerouac, and still needs a beatnik-ish fix. Ultimately, I was little underwhelmed, and also disappointed that 'Been Down' hints at Farina's undeniable,yet unrealizable potential; especially if he had a better story, and a few tips on plot development."}, {"userName": "Neil", "userReviewDate": "Apr 07, 2010", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/2914861-neil", "userReview": "Zippo Bang!

Many of the moments are as lyrical as the title, and I can imagine how radical if not first-of-its-kind the topics must have seemed to a reader in 1966. But in 2010, its beatnik battlecry is far too dated. While ultimately calling for a sexual revolution, the men view the women they know personally either as opaque obstacles or shining accessories to which they are entitled. The protagonist does not treat one single female with any degree of respect let alone tenderness, and is often downright abusive. Misogynistic paranoia is not radical, and nowhere are the reasons for its persistence explained but for the protagonist's central belief in his radical Exemption. Having met one too many real-life college boys convinced of their own Exemption, said state of mind strikes me as an adolescent phase no more radical than having an STD."}, {"userName": "Brad Spurgeon", "userReviewDate": "Aug 28, 2008", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/1470784-brad-spurgeon", "userReview": "After reading A Severed Head by Iris Murdoch it would be hard to find a book so diametrically opposed in style and in content.

But the more time I give it, the more rewarding it is becoming. It does strike me as probably being more outrageous at the time it came out than today. Dealing with university students, it's a sort of Brat Pack of the mid-sixties. But I'd always associated Richard Farina as a bit of a Beat kind of guy, and I suppose in some ways he was, but this has a very certain sophomoric feel to it, as the main character goes from party to party and observes life from a more or less stoned point of view. Too bad Farina died at age 29 just after the hardback came out. Would have been interesting to see where he could have gone from there. I'm still waiting for this thing to open up and sing. .... In the end it did not sing for me and I put it down. Didn't finish it. Probably just not the right time of life for me to read this. Might have worked better a long time ago....

I can see why some folks wouldn\u2019t like it: \u201ccoolness\u201d and literature are uneasy bedfellows. Plenty of readers choose the introspective path early on precisely because the cool kids are always being such assholes. But Farina is not simply singing a hymn to every magic moment of selfless abandon and shitfaced partying (aka \u201cbeing cool\u201d). As TRP observes in the Intro, \u201cDeath, no idle prankster, is always, in this book, just outside the window.\u201d What\u2019s menaced is something in all of us, if not our literal selves. Farina dubs it Exemption and Immunity. There are other names, some flattering, some condescending: youth, hope, idealism, transcendence, nirvana, love, omniscience, and so on. The prose is decidedly not delirious but the tight flow of a high and alert IQ out for a romp. The novel is a species of the disenchanting Bildungsroman, yet there is no surrender even when the Spirit knows it has been conquered. It is not the univocally upbeat monologue of a drug-addled egotist; other characters voice concerns that can\u2019t be ignored, try as Gnossos might. Here\u2019s Pynchon again: \u201cIn the course of the book, Gnossos looks at a number of possibilities, including Eastern religion, road epiphanies, mescaline, love. All turn out to have a flaw of some kind. What he\u2019s left with to depend on is his own coherence, an extended version of 1950s Cool.\u201d What is anybody going to do with the road ahead when they just want to read, fuck, and think?

Pynchon's Introduction to my copy has a lot of interesting things to say about the background behind the novel - the inspirations for the characters, Fari\u00f1a's storytelling abilities, how stultifying life during the mid-50s was - but whether it's due to his sentimental memories, its similarities to his own early work, or perhaps some ability to see things in the book I can't, he rates the book much more highly than I do (\"like the Hallelujah Chorus done by 200 kazoo players with perfect pitch\", in his infamous phrase).It's at heart one of those books that's almost more a reaction to the artistic conformity of the 50s than it is a work of its own. The plot is a mix of the kind of cheerful antisocial hooliganism of Fear and Loathing In Las Vegas and Animal House, while the writing style is more reminiscent of contemporaries like Ken Kesey or Jack Kerouac; think fast, irreverent, funny, loose, filled with drinking and drugs and friends breaking rules. There's a lot of overlap with the Whole Sick Crew from Pynchon's V. So much of the book is obviously based on Fari\u00f1a's personal life, like the setting, the characters, the stories like the wolf one, and probably the dialogue, that it comes off like he took \"write what you know\" extremely literally. The Gnossos Pappadopoulis is not completely a Mary Sue protagonist, but his overwhelming coolness - like the climactic rally scene where Gnossos is adulated for seemingly no reason at all - says perhaps more than was intended about the author's self-image. I'm willing to believe Pynchon that Fari\u00f1a was a better person than his hero, however there are a few scenes in the book, such as the resolution with the Kristin character, that are repulsive and not in a good way (then again, the same is true of Pynchon's books as well).Another reason why the book seems a bit lighter than, say, one of Pynchon's novel's from that period, is that the novel isn't really about much. Gnossos doesn't grow or change much; his self-image of Exemption from the nastier sides of life come off as much more juvenile or adolescent than McClintic Sphere's \"keep cool but care\" mantra from V. Also, though there's tons of drug use in the book, there isn't the same fascination with druggy/nerdy ideas that his friend had; compare the scene with L'H\u00f4pital's Rule here to the brilliant band-pass filter scene of Kilroy in V. In terms of writing style, there are many sentences with lists like in V., but they don't have the same kind of ring to them even though both authors have an affinity for the same Miles Davis and Mose Allison tunes that permeate their respective atmospheres. I don't mean to compare the two novels or writers so much, yet they are so nearly similar in so many ways that it's almost unavoidable - there's even a fun raga instrumental called \"V.\" on one of Fari\u00f1a's folk albums.Ultimately, Been Down So Long It Seems Like Up to Me comes off like a fascinating alternate take or set of demos from a band that was in the same scene as a more famous group yet whose career never took off in the same way. Fari\u00f1a's tragic death obviously affected Pynchon deeply, and maybe that's why his books published after the accident do treat death and mortality a little more seriously than Fari\u00f1a's does. I'm not sure the famous writing advice that dealing with death is required to be a \"serious\" writer is really true since there's no one way to write a novel, but this one seems to lack something that would put it in the first tier of novels from the time. Maybe if he'd lived this book would be seen as the beginning of something great instead of the merely acceptable half-forgotten relic it is now. Still, it is filled with the kind of exuberance that's moving at times and delivers its own brand of enjoyment, so if you've sworn an oath to track down every piece of literature connected to Pynchon, like I have, then this is a decent stop after Oakley Hall's Warlock."}], "description": "In an unerring, corrosively comic depiction of a campus in revolt, Richard Farina evokes the 1960s as surely as F. Scott Fitzgerald captured the 1920s. A landlocked, college-age hipster called Gnossos Pappadopoulis weaves his way through the psychedelic landscape, encountering - among other things - mescaline, women, demonology, hunting, truth, smuggling, falsehood, gluttony, prayer, science, fetishes, and occasional art. This is a classic novel of an explosive, expansive decade, a book that resonates as social history, sparkles with novellistic inventiveness and embodies the attitudes of an entire generation.
