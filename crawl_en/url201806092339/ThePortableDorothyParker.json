Take note of that order.Picasso once said of C\u00e9zanne that he was 'the father of us all'. Well, in similar terms, Dorothy Parker is my biological mother. Which makes me Picasso I guess, which I'll take.Parker's book reviews are the finest of the form. She was truly the queen of mean. As 'The Constant Reader' she praised and demolished the latest novels with such wit and grace that oftentimes the review was better than the work is discussed. She often filled her reviews with stories of her personal life or stray observations on society. Despite dying in 1967, her vicious tongue has never been equalled. I view Dorothy Parker as my greatest influence. As many people light candles in front of the Sacred Heart, I follow a similar regime with Parker, muttering incantations in front of her image and never gazing too long into her eyes.Thus The Portable Dorothy Parker is a volume which I believed would be a fitting replacement for the Holy Book. Which it somewhat is. In that it only gets really good near the end and you spend most of your time skipping over the bad bits.You see The Portable Dorothy Parker would be better titled The Short Stories of Dorothy Parker, interspersed by her Poetry with a paltry sampling of her Criticism, Reviews, Letters and Interviews. I am first to admit that I am not a huge fan of Parker's short stories. Don't get me wrong, she had many wonderful stories: Big Blonde, Arrangement in Black and White, The Waltz, From the Diary of a New York Lady and The Game are some shining examples. But almost five-hundred pages of this six-hundred page volume are dedicated to her stories, many of which are just not good. There's a reason why we don't immediately think 'short story writer' when we hear Parker's name. I feel the term 'hit and miss' was coined specifically for her short fiction. Those that hit are blinding critiques of early-20th century society, full of one-liners and characters which are equally as devastating. The misses are unreadable. Nothing much being written about nothing much. Therefore at time this volume is an absolute pain to get through, whilst at other times you want to rip each page out and frame them along a staircase.Most of my praise for this volume comes from the measly hundred pages dedicated to her non-fiction. This is where Parker Comes Alive! Such glittering meanness from the mouth of the poison Madonna. It depresses me so much. I'll never be her. The best I can do is plagiarise, which has served me quite well for many years. Sometime during my twenties I'll probably get a Dorothy Parker quote tattooed onto my skin, right next to my stigmata.Overall The Portable Dorothy Parker is a somewhat skewed collection of her finest writings. There is absolute gold in here, but one must sift through the mud first. Perhaps it is one for the fans."}, {"userName": "Joe Valdez", "userReviewDate": "May 04, 2015", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/26876584-joe-valdez", "userReview": "This portable library of short stories, poems and reviews by the author, poet and critic Dorothy Parker was loaned by a friend who attached the following advice: \"Parker might be best digested one bite at a time.\" Over the past two months, I've been doing that, eating lunch and digesting Parker's wit twenty pages at a time.My first impression, which I was proud of myself for making at the time, was that these pieces read like something that would appear in the New Yorker. I soon discovered that Parker was considered instrumental in making the New Yorker into the New Yorker; founded in 1925 by Harold Ross, the magazine published Parker's work irregularly from 1926 to 1955. When I think of \"the New Yorker short story\" I think of tofu; healthy and totally lacking in flavor. These droll literary observations of modern living would conceivably need a dash of Larry David or a side order of Jack Handey for me to remember them. It is in this tradition that I recount what I'd consider to be the best of Dorothy Parker.-- Arrangement In Black and White. An incessantly annoying party goer insists on being introduced to the guest of honor, a \"colored\" singer, revealing her own bigotry in the process.-- The Standard of Living. Two stenographers -- Annabel and Midge -- spend their free afternoons walking Fifth Avenue playing a favorite game: If you someone left you a million dollars and instructed you to spend it on yourself, what would you do? Fantasy money only buys fantasy happiness.-- Mr. Durant. An assistant manager in the credit department of a rubber factory impresses himself by handling a situation with a secretary who reveals she's \"in trouble\" in a delicate way. Returning to his family, Mr. Durant reveals his misogamy over a stray dog his children ask to keep.-- Mrs. Hofstadter on Josephine Street. A couple visit an employment agency for a referral on a servant and receive the most enthusiastic recommendation, a man named Horace who arrives at their home with too much enthusiasm for the couple to tolerate.-- Big Blonde. Self-described \"good sport\" Hazel Morse decides to settle down in her mid-thirties by accepting a marriage proposal. Discontent and alcohol turns them from lovers to enemies and as the relationship dies, Hazel considers doing likewise. Her maid, Nettie, has other ideas.I enjoyed quite a bit of Parker's poetry as well, particularly her six epithets, Tombstones in the Starlight.III. The Very Rich ManHe'd have the best, and that was none too good;No barrier could hold, before his terms.He lies below, correct in cypress wood,And entertains the most exclusive worms.Unfortunately, much of what remains in this collection grew tedious. Three of the pieces (The Lovely Leave, A Telephone Call, New York to Detroit) seem like drafts of the same story: a lonely woman waits by the telephone for her man to call her. Parker's women/ Parker can seem hysterical, and not in a screwball, Katharine Hepburn sort of way.Flannery O'Connor remains my favorite short story writer, a woman who was truly ahead of her time, lighting Molotov cocktails at the dawn of the Civil Rights movement. While I remain haunted by O'Connor's imagination, I can only say of Parker that she was a fine craftsman of the written word, prodigious and consistent."}, {"userName": "El", "userReviewDate": "Jul 31, 2015", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/83144-el", "userReview": "I thought everyone knew who Dorothy Parker was, regardless if everyone has read her or not. But then recently I mentioned at work that I was reading her and the guy I was talking to said \"Oh, who is Dorothy Parker?\"I read a lot of these stories back in my early 20s, which I think was the right time to read Dorothy Parker for the first time. I was much more impressed back then, like most readers in their early 20s are. But what's funny is that as the yeas have passed, I realized I forgot most of these stories, or at least what most of the stories were about. Returning now in my late 30s I can still appreciate the sardonic wit Parker is best known for, but I've had many more years of my own jading happen, and now reading Parker is sort of... been there, done that.Many of her stories are similar, which is not a bad thing in itself. I would recommend breaking up these readings over a longer stretch of time, or you will find yourself feeling a bit under the weather. Yes, there are funny moments, but these stories are mostly those sad-funny moments, where you sort of smirk but you're mostly just sad at the people these events are happening to. It's sort of like everyday life, if you're like me, where you hate the majority of people but still are incredibly sad by the things that you see happening to them.I never read the reviews back in the day, so I was glad to get out of the stories and into them now. I find her reviews much more palatable - they are intelligent, and entertaining, and I could easily see myself cracking open the paper back in her day just to read her reviews on whichever book she praised or trashed that week. I think that was where her true talent was, in reviews, instead of creating characters and keeping up dialogue in her short stories, some of which were better executed than others.Her poems... well, I'm not much of a poem-reader right now (I go through phases) and it's hard for me to discuss poems when I'm going through a non-poem phase as I am right now. I did find that she packed a harder punch in the shorter poems than the longer poems, and feel that this could also be said about her short stories as well. Some of the better stories were the shorter ones.Overall, I still appreciate Parker for her writing, even though I find myself not really enjoying it as much now as I used to. I recommend not listening to Morrissey while reading Dorothy Parker, because you will want to die by the end of the day."}, {"userName": "Jessica", "userReviewDate": "Aug 12, 2007", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/186838-jessica", "userReview": "So you want to write? Pick up this collection of poetry, short stories, essays, and criticism and bow to the master. Looking for a cutting remark? Dorothy Parker already said it, and said it best.

I used to love it. I still like it a great deal. Her writing has not changed, it is still rich and full of wonderful words arranged into beautiful, sentences, clever paragraphs. The whole work still has great value. Dorothy Parker's legendary acerbic wit amused me no end as a young woman. What has changed is my perspective. As I have gotten older, I have come to view it as an internal rage, vented upon everyone around her. She remains a great read, but now I feel just a little bit sorrier for her than I did in younger days. I'm guessing she experienced more than a bit of Women's Oppression Sickness, and the rapier tongue was a way of responding to a culture that often devalued literary women. My own background is in Women's and gay and lesbian studies. Parker was a legend in her time, and deservedly so.

Or maybe he just suggested I read her, but my ego prefers the first version. Anyway, seven years after this recommendation, I finally bought myself a copy of this book. It took me another full year to summon the courage to crack open the 600-plus-page tome. Six months later, I have finally finished it. For those of you keeping track at home, that means it took me 8.5 years to get to this point. But oh, it was worth the wait. In fact, I'm just sad that some hipster T-shirt company hasn't made a \"What Would Dorothy Parker Do?\" shirt, because I think I'm making that my new motto.I have always delighted in the thrill of delivering a well-crafted zinger, so Dorothy Parker is like my patron saint. The short stories and reviews were by far my favorite sections of the book (within those, the dialogue between the just-married couple on the train and her review of a ludicrous A.A. Milne play were my absolute favorites). In the introduction, the editor points out that Dorothy Parker considered it a great failure that she was never able to write a novel; after reading her short stories, I think I can see why. Parker has such utter (yet amusing) disdain for all of her characters; I think a novelist must at least like one or two of her characters a little bit if she's going to spend that much time with them. However, I didn't see this as a failure; rather, I consider Parker a success in that she's one of the only writers I've come across so far who's been able to completely master the short story.I do confess that I skimmed over most of the poetry (perhaps I'll go back and read it someday, but poetry just can't hold my attention before bed), and while there were some nice lines and some interesting insights into her personal life contained within her letters, some of those included were so pointlessly incongruous that I wondered if I was going to stumble upon a chapter of her old dry-cleaning receipts next.

I hope she would be proud.)"}, {"userName": "Ramsey", "userReviewDate": "May 30, 2008", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/1411341-ramsey", "userReview": "Such a witty woman.

And does your laugh sound like a suicide attempt? So, in the interest of research, here are some Dorothy Parker stories.Big Blonde is Parker's most famous short story. It's a direct response to Anita Loos's terrific Gentlemen Prefer Blondes - an unauthorized sequel, in fact. And if you thought Parker was all blithe sarcastic one-liners, here's her at her most cynical. Here's what happens to good sports - ain't we got fun? It's a great story and absolutely dark as fuck, just pure nihilism.I'm pretty sure Graham Greene borrowed Hazel Morse for his character Ida Arnold in Brighton Rock, btw.I liked Arrangement in Black & White (racist lady is horrible), that was funny.You Were Perfectly Fine (drunk guy has a new girlfriend, oops) and The Telephone Call (he's not going to call), I didn't like so much. Both a little...what, mean? Too much bummer, not enough smart? I didn't think they were offering me anything, really. One starts to get the impression that Parker isn't crazy about women. If a man wrote these stories we'd call him gross.The Game, from Part II - not in Parker's original selection for the first Portable edition - is terrific. Extremely dark.

The author is best known for her wit and finding the humor in the darkest of circumstances. I wish that I had read this book a bit at a time instead of trying to power through it. Still, there was plenty to enjoy in this collection. I think I most admire Parker's characterizations. The dialogue is so good that you can hear the voices in their own distinct rhythms and accents. And many of the stories did make me laugh. It would be hard to not find someone you recognize in at least one of her stories.A common theme, however, seems to be finding a man, holding on to a man or suffering for men. This made me wonder about Parker as a person and what inspired this pervading theme. Her mother died when she was 5 and she loathed her father and stepmother. Her first husband she lost in WWI and her second husband was rumored to be bisexual, something that Parker joked about with friends. None of which gives much clue to her writing. I'm sure there is an annotated edition with more information, but for now I am content with having finished the book and having enjoyed most of it."}, {"userName": "Catherine", "userReviewDate": "Aug 16, 2015", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/4708718-catherine", "userReview": "I love Dorothy Parker!! Smart, witty, biting, sarcastic, and so true to life. Even though these stories were written years ago, the themes and mood ring true today. I'd been wanting to read some of her work for a while and am glad I finally picked up this book.This is a collection of short stories, many of which focus on the relationships between men and women. Parker seems to have had a fairly negative view of romantic relationships as many of her stories highlight the miscommunication within a relationship and their subsequent breakdown. Her sarcasm veers into near-meanness at times, but pulls back right at the line.This collection also includes poetry and \"other writings\" that are mainly essays and reviews. Parker's poetry is short, to the point, and often biting. There is a sense of ennui in short stories that is magnified in her poetry. The reviews are wonderful for the sense of the person of Parker that comes through. She writes in a more personal tone in these reviews and essays that is refreshing.I am so glad I finally read Parker; it was worth the wait."}, {"userName": "Jeanette  \"Astute Crabbist\"", "userReviewDate": "Jan 02, 2012", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/796425-jeanette-astute-crabbist", "userReview": "I only read from page 445 to the end. Her short stories take up the first several hundred pages. They are dry and boring and contain not a hint of her trademark wit, so I skipped them. The miscellaneous non-fiction pieces at the back of the book are the jewels in her scribbler's crown. Book reviews, theater critiques, magazine articles, and private letters -- a cornucopia of her peculiar observations and famed turns of phrase. Parker was a very funny lady, and a brutally honest one as well. Her writing has barbs, but it's all in fun, and she's just as likely to pick on herself as on anyone else.Alexander Woollcott once affectionately said of Dorothy Parker: \"That bird only sings when she's unhappy.\" True perhaps, but what a voice. Forget the short stories. Read the non-fiction. Her style hums with more personality than any writer I've ever read."}, {"userName": "Morgan", "userReviewDate": "Aug 29, 2014", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/7366675-morgan", "userReview": "Writing a review for Mrs. Parker's Potable Dorothy Parker is a little difficult because she was a critique herself. I'll start this by giving a little background to who Mrs. Parker was and why I think she is an important female writer to read. Dorothy Parker is known to some people as a writer for several magazines and famous for her one liners like \"What fresh hell is this?\" However, like most writers she did so much more then just make witty comments. She was a \"feminist\" too, said so herself. She worked damn hard to get were she wanted in life and said what she wanted without caring what others thought. Plus there aren't many woman writers in her day that I can think of who wrote for magazines or even Hollywood movies. You don't necessarily need to actually read her stuff unless you get interested in her life, but I still think she is someone people should know about, especially people who call them self a feminist.Overall I love Mrs. Parker's work. She's one of those writers that I think can write about New York City well (although this is coming from a boy from Vermont that visits NYC about once a year). I also like her word choice too. She never overthought about a story, but she was great with dialogue and setting up a scene. Though this sampler of a book contains a variety of things, I think the things that stood out from the others stuff were her poems and her book reviews over her short stories. Her stories as she points out were mostly serious, but for me they were also for a time I never lived during to full understand. Her poems on the other hand were dark and funny or sometimes both. Only Dotty could make a joke about listing reasons not to kill yourself.Mrs. Parker's non-fiction stuff is maybe some of the best stuff in this collection. Not only is it telling on her options on this, but it's were you see her famous witty side. I was dying when she started to write about the Beats. Basically she hated them. She wished she could like there writing because it was good, but she hated them as people. Honestly I have to agree with her, although I like some of there stuff, I wouldn't like them as people. She also hated Hollywood, more the directors and behind the scenes stuff. She was a writer tying to make it in Hollywood and gave up because the people weren't very nice to script writers.Has much as she was bitchy about some stuff, you will find some odd things she adored too. She was a big fan of Dashiell Hammett. She liked Jonh Updike's first book that I just read and apparently we had the same thoughts. She was also a fan of the Winnie-the-Pooh books. Made me smile because I read them as an adult for the first time and enjoyed them, just was embarrassed to tell people I was reading them. She also claim Ernest Hemingway was one of the greats American short story writers (but didn't care for his novels) and she though Truman Capote could master any style of writing. I think if you wanted to pass her seal of approval you had to write out of passion, not for fun. She states in a interview they included that she didn't care for many female writers (even though she was a feminist) and especially fantasy because she though \"writing for fun\" wasn't what people should do in her day. In a way I have to agree with this too. Too many times I see passion left out of writing, however I have to disagree because sometimes writing is fun if you enjoy it enough.I really like Mrs. Parker, but I know already some people wouldn't like her because she wouldn't like them. Sorry Beat lovers you not welcome in he circle of friends. Also if you can take an joke, I wouldn't read her stuff either. She not really offensive (actually she is more progressive for her time) but she had a dark sense of humor...hence the poem about suicide I mentioned earlier. However, read Dorothy Parker like look back in time a woman who said what she wanted and worked her ass off to make it anywhere.What fresh hell is this? Why Mrs. Parker, you are a hell of a good writer."}, {"userName": "Amanda NEVER MANDY", "userReviewDate": "Nov 03, 2015", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/36873041-amanda-never-mandy", "userReview": "I can best describe this book as a brick; in physical size and in emotional weight. I went into it expecting simple stories laced with a sarcastic sense of humor that would rival my own. What I ended up with at times was overwhelming waves of disgust that dripped with feelings of melancholy towards the human condition. Depth and insight that cut to the bone with sarcasm and humor as a shot of vodka to numb the spirit; what a breathtaking combo.After reading a sampling of her stories, reviews and letters (GRUMBLE, GRUMBLE), I would say my love falls into the story category. There were a few back-to-back at the beginning that were a bit boring or too chit-chatty, but everything else was a solid slam. Maybe they were there to represent the progression of her writing or maybe just because she chose to place them in that order herself. I honestly never took the time to research it because the slight against the general composition of the book wasn\u2019t enough to send me on that journey.Her reviews were boring but I credit that to me not knowing the material she was reviewing. Again, not wanting to devote the time to research every item she reviewed to see if her reviews matched my feelings of the material and so on. I just chose to smile and nod and take them as they were. So half a star drop for my attention staying less than focused and another half for triggering one of my pet peeves.

I think it's an important piece of American history through the eyes of a woman."}, {"userName": "Kristina", "userReviewDate": "Feb 20, 2016", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/34109719-kristina", "userReview": "Ahhh, Miss Parker....I always wanted to sit with that illustrious group at the Algonquin round table in those heady days during my favourite era - 1920s.I have always been a fan of Ms Parker's poetry, snarky commentary and famous quotes, not so much her short stories.\"Men seldom make passes at girls who wear glasses\"\"You can lead a horticulture, but you can't make her think\"\"If you want to know what God thinks of money, just look at the people he gave it to\"\"It serves me right for keeping all my eggs in one bastard.\"LOL....works for me:)"}, {"userName": "Elizabeth", "userReviewDate": "Mar 07, 2009", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/2069203-elizabeth", "userReview": "Witty? Hmmm, how about erudite, clever, and ahead of her time... Dorothy Parker had much to say about 20th century married life and said so when such things were not talked about. She was known as the \"wittiest woman in America\" and after reading this collection of her work I understand why she disliked the moniker. Her stories read more bittersweet than witty and are a glimpse into an era with rigid roles."}, {"userName": "Megan", "userReviewDate": "Jan 04, 2008", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/742074-megan", "userReview": "I was really obsessed with Dorothy Parker and the whole Algonquin Round Table in high school. I've read most of this book, maybe not all of the short stories. I always liked her play reviews the best, where she was truly snarky and not just sort of a 1920's version of emo; all whiny and overly ironic and desparate for attention. This collected edition has a lot of her play reviews, most of her poetry and I think all of her short stories."}, {"userName": "Rincey", "userReviewDate": "Jul 08, 2013", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/278339-rincey", "userReview": "I think I'll finally move this over to the \"read\" shelf.

Good start."}], "description": "The second revision in sixty years, this sublime collection ranges over the verse, stories, essays, and journalism of one of the twentieth century's most quotable authors.For this new twenty-first-century edition, devoted admirers can be sure to find their favorite verse and stories. But a variety of fresh material has also been added to create a fuller, more authentic picture of her life's work. There are some stories new to the Portable, \"Such a Pretty Little Picture,\" along with a selection of articles written for such disparate publications as Vogue, McCall's, House & Garden, and New Masses. Two of these pieces concern home decorating, a subject not usually associated with Mrs. Parker. At the heart of her serious work lies her political writings\u2014racial, labor, international\u2014and so \"Soldiers of the Republic\" is joined by reprints of \"Not Enough\" and \"Sophisticated Poetry\u2014And the Hell With It,\" both of which first appeared in New Masses. \"A Dorothy Parker Sampler\" blends the sublime and the silly with the terrifying, a sort of tasting menu of verse, stories, essays, political journalism, a speech on writing, plus a catchy off-the-cuff rhyme she never thought to write down.The introduction of two new sections is intended to provide the richest possible sense of Parker herself. \"Self-Portrait\" reprints an interview she did in 1956 with The Paris Review, part of a famed ongoing series of conversations (\"Writers at Work\") that the literary journal conducted with the best of twentieth-century writers. What makes the interviews so interesting is that they were permitted to edit their transcripts before publication, resulting in miniature autobiographies.\"Letters: 1905-1962,\" which might be subtitled \"Mrs. Parker Completely Uncensored,\" presents correspondence written over the period of a half century, beginning in 1905 when twelve-year-old Dottie wrote her father during a summer vacation on Long Island, and concluding with a 1962 missive from Hollywood describing her fondness for Marilyn Monroe.A Penguin Classics Deluxe Edition with French flaps, rough front, and luxurious packaging.
