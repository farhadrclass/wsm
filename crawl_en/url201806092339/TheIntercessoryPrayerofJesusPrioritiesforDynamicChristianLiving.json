Now one of America's most respected Bible teachers, Warren Wiersbe, mines the Lord's petition for its rich theological and practical gems. The intercessory prayer reveals Jesus' priorities and concerns as he faced the final hours before his death. By studying this prayer, Christians can learn what was most important to Jesus and make his priorities their own. The Intercessory Prayer Of Jesus addresses the most pressing concerns of contemporary Christian living, including understanding salvation, making disciples, utilizing spiritual resources, become mature in Christ, creating a genuine community of believers, and balancing truth and love. The result is an expository and devotional study reflecting the doctrinal integrity and relevant teachings of Jesus' prayer recorded some two thousand years ago--and still very much relevant to Christian life today.\"--Midwest Book Review", "title": "The Intercessory Prayer of Jesus: Priorities for Dynamic Christian Living", "url": "http://www.goodreads.com/book/show/19214645-the-intercessory-prayer-of-jesus", "average": 4.09, "cover": "https://images.gr-assets.com/books/1386273964l/19214645.jpg", "reviews": 0, "authors": [{"url": "https://www.goodreads.com/author/show/4396930.Warren_W_Wiersbe", "name": "Warren W.
