WOW! 6 stars!! What a beautiful and powerful book! Definitely a  MUST  read!!I loved this book for so many reasons... I loved that Will and Lake were wonderfully refreshing hero and heroine characters because they were realistic, smart, not annoying in any way and didn't make stupid decisions. I loved the author's writing style - its very simple but very powerful and its one of those books that really makes you  feel  what is going on with the characters. I was completely and utterly shocked to find that I loved the Slam poetry. Boy is it powerful (I know I've used that word a lot here but it seems to be the best of that fits what I'm feeling). I've always hated poetry - was never able to absorb it or relate to it but in this book, it is so effecting in giving the reader a view of what is going on in the characters' head and heart. I loved the intensity of Will and Lake's feelings for each other. I had butterflies in my stomach for most of the book and could stop turning the pages.This book brought me to tears more than once. And my cheeks were damp throughout the whole final 10% or so. Loved it!!!This book is about love and loss and life and death (not the death of the hero/heroine though, fear not lol). I'd highly highly recommend it to pretty much anyone and everyone who loves to read. Now I understand what all the fuss was about - everywhere I looked here, people were raving about it and now I'm joining that club!I'm off to go read the sequel now - I can't wait to read more about Will and Lake... Here's a slam quote:I got schooled this year by a Boy.  a boy that  I'm seriously, deeply, madly, incredibly, and undeniably  in  love with. And he taught me the most important thing of  all ...

Not even for a YA romance.SLAMMED was angsty teenage love story with a heart wrenching sub-plot, but the heroine made it a very disappointing read. I expected a more mature minded heroine, not an overly emotional girl who thinks a mad boy crush after one date is the 'real thing'. The whole high school giggly student bit was a turn off for me. I liked Will a lot, and thought his maturity and love for poetry was well portrayed, but I didn't get the connection with Layken. She made dumb choices, said dumb comments, put him at risk, and made everything be about her. Personally, I thought the author did a great job of developing a typical 18 y/o girl, but it only emphasized her lack of maturity as a lead heroine.This would have worked for me in a more adult setting, but the the teenage angst was over done. At times she was a drama queen only focused on herself, and she had no concept of how others felt. Then other times shes a silly giggly high schooler. Either way, I didn't buy her as a convincing heroine.The subplot was very good and emotional, but it was great wallpaper only. The romance needs to stand on its own, not be carried by a secondary storyline. SLAMMED is a teenage girl fantasy romance story, so it doesn't surprise me at how popular it is. But I'd prefer to read about more mature minded couples falling in love, so this one didn't cut it for me."}, {"userName": "Regan", "userReviewDate": "Jan 13, 2015", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/19645927-regan", "userReview": "Well damn."}, {"userName": "Emily May", "userReviewDate": "Oct 07, 2013", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/4622890-emily-may", "userReview": "I am conducting what I'm shelving as a \"New Adult (NA) Experiment\". I'm going to work my way through some of the popular New Adult books and see if I can weed out the crap and hopefully find some surprising gems. Here's hoping!It's been a while, my friends. I had to take a break for the sake of my sanity. I decided to return to the NA experiment with Slammed because I'd heard it was less offensive than Hoover's later novel - Hopeless - and also because I've had luck with a NA student/teacher romance in the past (Unteachable). Alas, I was wrong to be so optimistic. I suppose that Slammed is less offensive when compared to the creepy pro-stalker ideas being thrown around in Hopeless but it certainly makes up for it by being an example of terrible writing. Where Hopeless offered entertainment and sexual tension that made it obvious where its popularity came from, I am honestly confused by all the positive reactions to Slammed.I do think if I'd read this book first I might have at least appreciated the improvement in quality of the author's writing by the time she wrote Hopeless. In this, Hoover's writing is a couple steps below average and looks even less impressive when compared to the fantastic teacher/student romance in Unteachable (and it's beautiful writing). The author struggles with the build-up of the relationship between Layken and Will, forgetting about sexual tension and/or chemistry and jumping too quickly from their meeting to some extremely cheesy moments. The drama is constant but handled roughly - making scenes that should be heart-breaking feel emotionally manipulative and causing me to roll my eyes rather than to burst into tears.Both characters, as well as the book in general, lack any emotional maturity. Layken frequently behaves like a bratty little kid, slamming doors and calling Will names. I really had no patience for her childish antics. Though, Will wasn't much better. He would constantly lead Layken on and then blame it on a moment of weakness. More than once.It was cringy and stupid because the reader is well aware that it wasn't a moment of weakness and that he actually wants to be with Layken but he's being an immature idiot and not to mention a complete fucking tease. Just sayin'.Aside from the writing being awful, the real problem in this for me was the failure to convince me that there was any real barrier to Layken and Will's relationship. Perhaps it was because their ages were too close to give me any sense of the forbidden or because Will wasn't exactly a \"real\" teacher, but nothing about it got my heart pounding like Raeder's Unteachable. It seemed more like there was no problem except the one the two of them created in their little melodramatic minds. Angst for the sake of angst. But I wasn't buying it. I think it's fair to say that me and Ms Hoover finally part ways for good."}, {"userName": "Baba  ", "userReviewDate": "Aug 02, 2013", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/4669232-baba", "userReview": "[knocked What's His Name? on his ass out of PURE jealousy and NOT because he sexually assaulted Layken.

JUST KIDDING! Let's start with Lake (I feel like I can call her Lake since I know her so well). Many authors-huge, famous authors-write characters that make me roll my eyes...scrunch up my nose...close the book and not miss them-EVER. Lake was not one of those characters. She was literary flesh and bone. She was \"cool\" and funny and deep. Most of all, I believed she was eighteen. We all know what Will was, so I won't go there. Maybe I WILLI want himYou know what else I want? Accolades for another rising Indie author that wrote a novel better than 99.9% of the novels on the shelves. The writing was flawless. Her characters were perfectly imperfect (hello Layken and Eddie giggling and making Chuck Norris jokes in detention). I am a notorious book snob. I read only the best, I recommend only the best. I cannot say enough about both the creativity, originality and depth of Slammed. A book that surely rises above all of its competition and SLAMS them in the face. I would urge Colleen Hoover to contact Stepehenie Meyer and perhaps offer her some lessons on character development and plot structuring. I would urge Colleen Hoover to keep writing stories and creating characters for those of us who are death to sick of boring, insipid characters (see I'm so clever).Or maybe Colleen is the clever one, because this book has set itself so far apart authors will be trying to catch it for years."}, {"userName": "Whitney Atkinson", "userReviewDate": "Sep 18, 2013", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/14457130-whitney-atkinson", "userReview": "Idk why I keep reading Colleen Hoover when I know I won't like her.

The unique plot, the bitter-sweet tension, and the tender romance all had me mesmerized...but I won't further digress on these elements, as I'm sure they will clearly speak for themselves...What I do want to shine a light upon is the breathtaking wisdom that abundantly graced these pages and made its way to not only my heart, but deep within--resonating with my soul.\u00a0(And I'm not only referring to the ingenious Avett Brothers quotes!)This book was more than a love story. It was more than clever entertainment. It took every wonderful element I long for in a story and set it into motion through what felt like a song. It showed that grief, happiness, love, and loss are are all emotions that can coexist so long as there is acceptance and appreciation for what IS. The slam poetry was phenomenal, but it was not the only lyrical aspect.

Who knew I could feel so utterly heartbroken, enlightened, and peaceful at the same time without becoming conflicted.Slammed was an extraordinary read that had POWER is in its simplicity.

There was not a single message conveyed that was not backed up by a stunning example played out by the characters. \u00a0It was as if the author said--I can tell you my idea of peace, love, and happiness, but I'd much rather show you...Through poetry, and pain,\u00a0happiness and shame,\u00a0family ruins and pink balloons;\u00a0by acceptance of strife\u2014we're shown how to emphasize the LIFE in our lives.\u00a0...And for that, I thank you, Miss Hoover.\u00a0\n\nBook Stats:\n\u25aa\t Genre/Category: Romance/New Adult\u25aa\t Steam Caliber: Mild but sexy\u25aa Romance: Slow-building.

I finished Slammed over 30 minutes ago... And I just stopped crying. I went into Slammed ONLY knowing that this book involved slam poetry. I had never even read the synopsis too this story (after reading Ugly Love I knew that when it comes to Hoover books you have to go into it blind). The odd thing is of all of Colleen's books, I've owned this one the longest and I'm just now reading it. I HATE MYSELF FOR THAT!!!!I would never believe that this was Hoover's debut novel. It's so strong that I assumed it was a 4th or 5th book. Nope. She never fails too incorporate something new and unique into her writing, if it's paintings, music, or even poetry. She really has a style all her own. There are only three writers I will drop everything I'm\u00a0 reading to pick up their work... That's John Green, Jennifer Armentrout, and Colleen Hoover.Slammed follows the story of new Michigan transplant Lake as she is forced to start a new life her senior year of high school. After her fathers untimely death her mother can't afford to keep them living in Texas. First day in the new place Lake's brother befriends the boy next door... Introducing Lake to Will. The charming, handsome, and sweet poet.The characters in this book feel so real! Lake and Will are written too perfection. Lake, though mature for her age has the same immature moments as the rest of us. Will is just so sweet, speaking in a way that will have you swooning all over the place. Both their love towards there family captured my heart 200%. Both characters physical appearance is described just enough to give you and idea then left you to make your own decision. As the characters develop in the story the story itself grows into something so hard to capture in words. I thought that the insta-lust that happen right away was going to ruin this book for me. But at the end I realized that this story might have involved love but it's not the love you except. I wish I could explain that more but it's the only way I can say it. It about a deeper kind of love than just being with someone. The sub characters like Eddie and the baby brothers... PHENOMENAL. Colleen has it so they are sub character that manage to shine so much light without ever over powering.The plot has this pace between fast and medium, and it was at a rate I'd never experienced before. Then of course there's the whole poetry and music aspect that was put into this story. It's what takes this book to the next level. The poetry is introduced in the first handful of pages. I didn't know how I was going to feel about it... BUT WOW. Seriously the first poem had me in tears and they only got better from there. The quotes from The Avett Brothers are perfect placed and were just a nice little treat at the stat of every chapter. Like I said, this is a story you need to go into blind, therefore I can't, even though I want to, go into more detail. This book started strong and then had me a blubbering mess.  I don't know if I should be mad or thankful that Colleen is constantly finding new ways to tear my heart out of my chest. I don't think I've ever not been a mess at the end of one of her books. \n\n\nThis story made me laugh a hundred times, and cry at least five. Slammed is one beautiful, quotable, and poetic line one after another. Slammed touched me on such a personal level I probably cried harder than most. This book is a must read, and definitely made it's way into my all time favorites.

There comes a time in your life when against all odds you know there is a light at the end of the tunnel, And that you will make it out okay. Breathing, living, crying, screaming, yelling, smiling. There comes a time in life when you know that no matter what happens, you can still look back,And say you gave it your all. In today\u2019s world, it seems like nothing will turn around for the better as we sit and wait and become bitter.In life you find things that are astounding. In every way imaginable and every way you can see. Things that are life changing in the best way possible. Things that you can only describe with the most vivid of words and actions. There comes a time in life when you say no matter what, at the end of the day I gave it my all.Knowing that there is peace within you and with all that surrounds you. There comes a time in life when you smile because you know, at that time life is everything you wanted it to be but never thought that it could. Shouting from the rooftops the joy that you have inside and wanting to share it with the world. There comes a time in life when all is at it should be and you turn around, look at yourself and know that this is what you were meant for.....MLD...And that time came for me throughout the entirety of this book. I cannot remember the last time I was so touched, so inspired, so intrigued, so consumed with a book as I was with Slammed. The slam poetry was utterly brilliant and the story to go along with it was damn near perfection. Layken (aka Lake) is an eighteen year old who has just moved away from everything she's ever known as \"home\" after her fathers sudden death. She needs and tries so hard to be the rock that her little brother, Kel, and mother can lean on. On moving day, she meets her neighbors from across the street, Will and his little brother, Caulder. It was pretty much love at first sight...for the little brothers as well. I loved the dynamics of the kids' relationship. How easy it is to just accept and be happy at that age...Will asks Lake on a date and it's unlike any typical date she's been on before. None of the boring questions about how many siblings, dogs, cats, etc.. Then he brings her to a Slam session. She is thoroughly enjoying herself and begs him to do a slam for her, he volunteers, does his slam and the rest is history...\nThree days ago, I was devastated, bitter, and hopeless. Today I woke up feeling happy for the first time in months.\nWill did that for Lake, in all the months that had passed and while her unhappiness began to consume her, he helped her to see life in a different way......Then a devastating revelation happens....and then another, and you think to yourself, WHY??? Why can't everything just be okay?!...Throughout the course of the book, Lake and Will had to face some of the toughest obstacles any two people could ever or should ever have to face. I would like to think that Lake's best friend Eddie helped to keep her grounded, she was one of my favorite characters in the book; her joy leaped off of the pages to me and I found myself smiling every time she would give off her words of wisdom...This book had me going through so many emotions. I had a lot of ups and downs, tears of sorrow and tears of contentment, grins and frowns. My heart beat rapidly at times for the hope of a solution and beat rapidly at times for the nervousness of what was to come...So many adversities to overcome, so many issues to work through, so many questions of priority. Through poetry so much is revealed of how one copes with things, deals with feelings; pouring their soul out to a captive audience. Why? Because it speaks volumes:\nThe ways these poets are able to lure you into a whole new world, viewing things from a vantage point you've never seen before. Making you feel like you are the mother who lost her baby, or the boy who killed his father, or even the man who got high for the first time...\nThis was so much more than a book to me, it put so many things into perspective, it touched me on a deeper level. At the first slam, I knew this would be one of my favorite books of all time, now that I'm done? I'm glad to see that I was right! I would give this book WAY more than 5 stars if GR would let me, but for now, know that I absolutely LOVED this book and am excited to read more of Layken and Will's story in the sequel! In closing, I will leave you with this...Be accepting of everything. People's differences, their similarities, their choices, their personalities. Sometimes it takes a variety to make a good collection."}, {"userName": "Katie", "userReviewDate": "Jul 29, 2015", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/8062998-katie", "userReview": "I just read this whole thing on a plane and WOW.

I confess I wasn't slammed right away. In fact, I was devistated. Utterly disappointed and totally convinced this was going to be another generic romance that happens way too quickly....I was wrong! Wrong. Wrong. WRONG!!! The turning point for me was the plot shocker and shock me it did. My mouth was slammed wide open with complete surprise. I love it when I don't see it coming. The story\u00a0was\u00a0transformed into a heartshattering, heartbreaking, and passionate story of love, loss, turmoil and a whole lot of other stuff. It was an emotional rollercoaster gone wild!!!This is usually where I talk about the characters I loved, didn't love, or loved to hate, but I can't. I loved them all. You don't just fall for Layken and Will's relationship you fall for every single one! Her relationship with her mom, her brother. Will's relationship with his brother...Relationship-fest 2012!!!! I'm in love...with EVERYONE!!I instantly dove right into Point of Retreat without even coming up for air. I laughed, I cried, I became sexual frustrated!! I never saw this series coming, but it slammed into me with such force all I can say is\u00a0read the book!!Reviewed at http://toughcriticbookreviews.blogspo..."}, {"userName": "C.J.

Slammed is the first book I've been able to read in almost seven months and it's not my typical read.In all honesty, I don't usually read YA books because they usually don't have any sex in them. I read Colleen Hoover's, Slammed, because she took a HUGE chance recommending my dark erotica to her mainstream audience. I appreciate the hell out of that.So, what did I think?At first, I wasn't sure I was going to enjoy the book - that's just me being honest. I thought it hugged the romance 'formula' a little too much for my taste. I admit, I might have walked in with that preconceived notion. However, as I kept reading, I found myself connecting with the emotions in the book. I loved the poetry. I loved the message.SPOILER ALERT!My dad past away several years ago. I don't like to think about it. I don't like to read about death and how to cope. I'm more of a push your emotions down into your stomach until they make you sick type of girl - lol. I cried when Layken found that barrette. I find things sometimes and I just sit there and stare.I empathized with the anger the characters felt over the eventuality of Layken's mother's prognosis. My dad was diagnosed with cancer and was told he would live 6 months. He lived 6 years, but the time never seemed like enough. Also, I was angry about the fact he kept drinking after he was diagnosed. I felt like he was doing it on purpose - shaking his fist at my anger and grief.I understood Will and Layken's acceptance. Once my father died, I realized he had lived his life the way HE wanted. He deserved that. Everyone deserves to go their own way. I am still here. I have to find my own way. I forgave him a long time ago.By the end of this book, I was in tears and thinking about my dad, but more than that, I was thinking, 'Colleen Hoover deserves every ounce of her success'. She has written something very special. Like any author worth a shit - she parted with a piece of her soul. I take it with me.I'm the fan girl, Colleen.

They were absolutely cute and loveable but they reallyy know how to make things complicated, unbearable and hard for themselves and any potential present or future relationship. Overthinking everything, all the time isn't bound to end well, period... just really glad that this time it did end well after all. Besides all that, they're relationship with their brothers and how they looked out for/ helped out with each other's sibling even though they had issues was completely amazing. Lake's mom and her best friend Eddie were my two favorite characters in the whole book, those ladies had great advice, were hilarious and knew how to deal with difficult situations like a boss, also the support from those two was amazing and heart-touching\ud83d\udda4 like wow, especially when they were both dealing with complicating, life changing issues in their own lives. And lastly... Loved the poetry in this story, that was another favorite. While I don't like the Avett Brother's music, their lyrics were amazing and very fitting.

I couldn't put this down once I started reading. Eighteen year-old Layken, or Lake, has just moved to Michigan from Texas. Her father has just died six months earlier and her mother moves them there because she gets a good job offer and they can no longer afford their house. Immediately after pulling up with the moving van, Lake meets the neighbor across the street, Will, and his little brother Caulder. He's a few years older than Lake, and in her eyes, \"hot.\" Caulder and Lake's younger brother, Kel are fast friends, playing the minute Kel jumps out of the moving van. Lake is happy that at least this move won't suck for her little brother. Although things start looking up for Lake when Will asks her out on a date.  Will is so different from most guys and so forward. It shocks Lake a little. Their first date is different and in my opinion, amazing! He takes her to a poetry slam which before reading this, I had no idea what it was. It's where people get up in front of an audience and perform a piece of poetry they've written. It's not typical poetry, more like a soul-bearing piece, written and then performed. She's is mesmerized by the first performance and then when Will gets up and performs his, she's a goner! She is taken by him and falls hard, and fast. And he's fallen hard for her, too. Here's a quote from that night that gives me shivers: \"Patience.\" he whispers. You don't think that's much? Wait until you read the scene! Lake discovers she has a lot in common with Will. Unfortunately straight after this date, they discover a block to their relationship and have to keep apart. Here's a heartbreaking quote for you: \n\"God Layken. How do you do it?\" she says. \"How do I do what?\" I sniff as I continue to wipe the tears from my eyes. \"How do you not fall in love with him?\" The tears begin flowing just as quickly as they had ceased\u2026..\"I don't not fall in love with him. I don't not fall in love with him a lot!\" \nAdd to this, Lake's mom is all of a sudden leaving often for unexplained errands. As suddenly as things seemed to be falling in place, everything has fallen apart. I can't tell you how much I loved this story. I connected so deeply with Lake and Will. I adored the little brothers, Caulder and Kel, and Lake's mom too (even though I was a little angry with her for some things). My heart was pulled in lots of different directions. The reason Lake and Will must stay apart is not Will's fault, but you can't help but blame and get mad at him for his actions. Even when you know you shouldn't. Lake writes and recites a poem and you're right there cheering her on. I know I'm being vague, but I seriously don't want to spoil this for any who haven't read it. This story pulls on all your heart strings! There's also a fair amount of humor in this story that lifts the mood in just the right places. This was such a heartwarming story! I read the sequel straight after because I didn't want to let these character go! Don't let the fact that this is a self-published novel fool you. This was a truly amazing debut for Colleen Hoover. I'll definitely be reading whatever she writes next.

Shit happens. And it happens a lot. To a lot of people.\u201d\n\nI loved that the book focused on the stages of grief and the significance of healing other than the romance. However, I feel like I would've enjoyed this book so much more if there wasn't the infamous insta-love. I lost my connection with the book the moment Layken \"Lake\" Cohen and Will Cooper became emotionally attached to each other in an instant. Would it have been better if they started off as \"friends\" rather than having their relationship fast-forwarded to \"forbidden love\"?The best parts of this book were Lake and her family's interactions. There were times when I found myself having the difficulty to take everything in because of the tear-jerking exchange of dialogues between her and her mom. And oh, I loved the poetry that the characters rendered. And Kel and Caulder are adorable kids, too. I conclude that Slammed wasn't one of those Colleen Hoover books that gave me such an indefinable feeling. It wasn't as good and unforgettable as November 9 and Confess, but I loved the life lessons that it inspired as a whole. But please, no more insta-love.

On one hand, I should be a responsible reviewer and review this book objectively, pointing out the flaws, the inconsistencies, the problems\u2026SCREW THAT.This book gripped my heart and swept me up in a whirlwind of emotion. Yes, I\u2019m going cheesy here. I don\u2019t care. It\u2019s my review and it\u2019s going to ooze cheesiness. I cannot help it. You get a cheesy me when I cried for most of a book. You get cheesy me when I go into work late because I had to reapply my makeup. You get cheesy me when I was so moved that I had to STOP thinking about the book at work for fear I\u2019d tear up again. The book moved me. Because it moved me in such a strong manner, it deserves a high rating. I know I\u2019m a crybaby and can cry over any sad scene but this book moved me, it wasn\u2019t just sad scenes. Whether it hit the right spot just for me, or it will have the same effect on other people, I don\u2019t know. I\u2019m just telling you- it moved me.This book is not your normal story. It\u2019s like a snapshot of a small portion of a Layken\u2019s life. It\u2019s not intended to tell the story of Layken or even go in-depth over any of Layken\u2019s problems. As a reader, you get to peak into a small part of Layken. While it is a small part, it is full of pain, heartache, discovery, laughter, and growth. I loved this. You are literally dropped into the problem, and once the problem is resolved, you are dropped out of it (the end). You wonder, well what now? That feeling of unanswered questions made me realize how quickly I fell into Layken\u2019s life. I craved more. That doesn\u2019t mean I wasn\u2019t satisfied with what I got. It doesn\u2019t mean I didn\u2019t think the little taste of Layken\u2019s life wasn\u2019t amazing, it just means I want more.Layken and Will and \u201cthe brothers\u201d were amazing. The banter, the emotions, the problems, was so heartbreakingly real that I could read page after page of interaction between the four of them. Add in a mother with a very profound secret, a twist that puts a wall up between Layken & Will, some well-developed minor characters, and you then have one new fan of Colleen Hoover- ME!"}], "description": "Nach dem Unfalltod ihres Vaters zieht die 18-j\u00e4hrige Layken mit ihrer Mutter und ihrem Bruder von Texas nach Michigan.
