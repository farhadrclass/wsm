Someone just tried to kill her, but she wouldn't recognize him if she saw his face. She doesn't even remember her own name. I would like to thank NetGalley and the publisher Thomas Nelson Fiction for giving me a copy of this book.3.5 stars. Haven of Swans is the first book I've read by Colleen Coble and I liked it. It's Christian Fiction, but not overtly so which I liked. The message was there, but it didn't overshadow the story and wasn't preachy. I didn't realize when I requested this book that it was the fourth book in a series, but it didn't seem to matter much. It stood on it's own and was a complete story. I thought the mystery was ok, but there were too many big coincidences and the end felt a little anticlimactic. What a way to die though. I almost thought it was funny. I was also disappointed that I guessed who the killer was pretty early on. It wasn't glaringly obvious, but I think anyone who reads a lot of mystery will pick up on the little clues that were left here and there. The good thing is that I wouldn't have expected the characters in the book to know who it was so easily, so I didn't feel like they were dumbed down.I'm interested in this author and this series and I'll probably end up reading more books from it eventually. I would also like to read some of the other books the author has written that are not a part of this series.Just on a side note here- I thought it was an interesting coincidence that I got two different books from NetGalley that I read back to back (see The Marsh King's Daughter ) that were set in the UP of Michigan, and they both had covers involving water, and were mysteries that featured killers.Review also posted at Writings of a Reader"}, {"userName": "Amy", "userReviewDate": "Mar 21, 2017", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/28286656-amy", "userReview": "Sadly, I have had to abandon my read of this book. I've read 11 of Colleen Coble's books so far, and I've thoroughly enjoyed them. Yes, they are not for the faint hearted. They include death & murder, and disturbing revelations. So far I have been able to appreciate the plot for what it is, and for the intricacy in combining mystery with romance, with a location to 'die for' (sorry for the pun!)Haven of Swans begins at a level I have not even encountered before. I found it extremely dark and uncomfortable to read, and chose for my own sanity to put the book away. I do love Christian reads, but I think it borders on a story that goes to a place my spirit does not want to dwell. If this was a movie, I would not choose to watch it.

And this book was no exception. The story opens in the killer's point of view. Then we're introduced to the main character, who doesn't know where she is, why she's bleeding from a stab wound, or who the little girl is in her arms. All she knows is that she's terrified and believes someone tried to kill her. A car approaches, and she doesn't know whether to run or ask for help. The driver could be the person she's running from. Thankfully, the driver, Bree Matthews, provides a haven in her lighthouse and protection with her husband and search-and-rescue dog, Samson. When another murder happens in the area, one done in the same pattern as a wanted serial killer, a handsome cop arrives in Rock Harbor to help. The refugee, who thinks her name might be Evelyn, feels an instant connection to the cop. Is he the man she's running from, or is he connected to the past she can't unlock?This story is full of twists and turns, and just when you'll think you know who the murderer is, you'll be proven wrong. I recommend this book to anyone who enjoys suspense/thrillers."}, {"userName": "Susan Snodgrass", "userReviewDate": "Mar 18, 2017", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/7103516-susan-snodgrass", "userReview": "I thoroughly enjoyed this book. When I read it under the title 'Abomination' in 2007. I am taking away a star, even though it deserves it as a book, because I seriously dislike this practice of publishers taking a book that was published years earlier and re-publishing it under a new title. It seems somehow unethical to me. Why not just simply re-publish the book under it's original title? It's very disconcerting to buy a book, as I have in the past, only to discover it's a book I've already read, just now out with a new title. I just don't approve of this. Abomination was a great book. Colleen Coble does a wonderful job with it. It would have stood on its own again under the same title. *I was given a copy of this book by the publisher via Net Galley.

Saw the cover and it had a sticker on it that said it was an 'inspirational' title. ..... #1 - I don't know who the he** put that sticker on this book .... or why they thought it was inspirational. ..... I had no inkling of anything that would be even remotely inspirational in the general sense ... so ... If someone at your library has done the same thing ... they are wrong. ha ha. The book is okay. It's about a woman who, after being nearly killed by a man, runs away with her daughter, only she's lost all memory of the trauma and who she is, where she came from, where she's going. She only knows that she needs to get away. She has no memory of her daughter even. Her ex-husband is a police officer who is working on murders of a gruesome kind, where the killer has mutilated bodies by taking their face, and then some other body part. He leaves clues for the police on Geo-Caching sites, and uses the locations of his victims bodies as the Geo Cache coordinates. There are some plot twists in here that I didn't see coming. Perhaps they had clues to the twists and I just wasn't paying enough attention (which is a crime when reading!) or perhaps it was sensational twist... I couldn't for sure tell you which right now. Anyways. I think it's a good read if you need something to read and you like mental thrillers. There is death and mental illness and revenge involved. And Geese ... lots of Geese. I didn't get too into it but, perhaps I just had more exciting things on the horizon and couldn't give it a fair shot.

The suspense just doesn't quit -- complicated and gnarly and completely riveting. The plot twists and turns and twists some more. It got to the point where I just couldn't put the book down and finished it in the wee hours of the morning.Back in Rock Harbor with Bree and Samson the wonder search-and-rescue dog was a pleasant surprise. The Rock Harbor series books were my first Colleen Coble reads so I squealed when Bree and Samson showed up early on. :-) You don't need to have read any of that series in order to enjoy this one. I just got an unexpected kick when I met up with them and the rest of the Rock Harbor gang in this story.Abomination is classic Coble -- filled with subtle intricacies in a complex plot and packed with surprises.

And there were parts of the story that were resolved without taking it far enough along the path to make me care. Yes, it was a Christian book and presented a clean story without bad words or sex scenes which means that I can recommend it to my Christian friends in the library where I serve. But I have an aversion to drippy love stories and there was a bit of that in this book. One thing that was good. I did not figure out the Gideon character. The author presented enough options to keep me guessing as to who was. But the story line regarding the child did not have a satisfactory ending. It was as if she just said what can I do to end this so the main characters don\u2019t get hurt. Not everything in life gets tied up in such nice neat bundles.If my library does not already have the book by its original title, we will most likely purchase this title since I have many readers that are Coleen Coble fans.

From the very start of the book, this story stole my breath and at times sped up the beating of my heart. The ending was so climatic I couldn\u2019t read it fast enough! The setting is the UP of Michigan. There is a woman who cannot remember who she is, the name of the child in her arms, or that she has been badly hurt! At first, she moves almost on auto pilot, but she cannot tell why or how she knows what she must do to keep \u201chim\u201d from finding her again. After some more time, she remembers her name, and with more time her past. Her husband, Nick, is a captain for the Michigan State Police, and he and his wife are in the middle of a divorce. When he goes to pick up his little girl, the scene he encounters scares him. He cannot locate either his wife or 2-year-old daughter. After a while, he begins to be taunted by a person who has had something to do with his wife and child\u2019s disappearance or death.Through a wonderfully written tale, readers become enraptured with the characters like Bree and Naomi along with their search and rescue dogs or the sister of Eve, who has amnesia, and the family she can\u2019t remember even though she must be ready to go to court to fight for her daughter to remain with her. There is so much going on in the book though it isn\u2019t hard to follow at all; it is just the opposite. It really drew me in and wouldn\u2019t let me go! I was up till 2:30 a.m. reading the book. The ending so caught me by surprise I wondered why I didn\u2019t see it coming!Colleen\u2019s books are wonderfully written. They include faith, romance, danger, mystery, adventure, and more! I have yet to be bored by one of her books. I look forward to when her next book is published and will grab it at the first opportunity to read and then share it with a friend. Books allow us to enjoy a fictional place for a while as well as learn from the characters how faith can be tested and put into action.So, pick up a copy and read till the very last page that will fill you with joy and hope!"}, {"userName": "Jessica Taskinen", "userReviewDate": "May 20, 2017", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/61221873-jessica-taskinen", "userReview": "She doesn't remember who she is or who wants her dead.

Her memory seems to be locked away despite the few instances where a random memory is triggered by her circumstances. However, when she and a few of her newly made friends find a dead body in the woods near Rock Harbor, the sight and smell of a peanut butter sandwich triggers panic and fear. She knows he has found her. Just who he is, she has no idea.Obsessive about his work, Nick, who loves his family deeply, found himself served with divorce papers. Things only get worse as he find his soon to be ex-wife's home ransacked with blood on the carpet with no sign of his wife, Eve, or his daughter, Keri. Distraught, Nick plunges headlong into his search for his family, whom most presume to be dead.Gideon has suffered greatly in the past, but the pain has only serve to make him stronger... to make him a better man. Passionately proclaiming pain as a powerful tool for cleansing, Gideon's twisted past leads him to initiate cleaning through pain for others.This recent novel from Colleen Coble deals with the themes of sin and forgiveness, of longing and desire. Filled with creepy bad guys, gallant though flawed heroes, and cast of characters who love God and love others, the story captured me and the unsolved mystery held me. Don't we all long to feel safe and feel loved? Our mysterious main character desires those two things, but only when she reaches the end of the story will she realize what God had already given her... and how God's promise is true even when we can't see it: He is working all things out for our good.Thanks to NetGalley and Thomas Nelson for an e-ARC of this book for review.

Like her other books in the series you don\u2019t necessarily have to read them all in order and they would work well as standalones except for the parts about her personal life. Each book is essentially its own contained mystery. Colleen Coble writes excellent suspense thrillers that build with the right momentum.This was a good story that will keep you guessing until the big reveal. I hope you have a strong stomach because Coble doesn\u2019t pull any punches when it comes to the gruesome details. There\u2019s plenty of adventure to go along with the intriguing mysterious element along with the right bit of lightheartedness which you\u2019ll need to get over the missing body parts. Her characters are mostly well written, you\u2019ll end up caring about the good ones and hoping the bad ones take a long walk off a short cliff. The only character issue I had was with her law enforcement, they didn\u2019t feel entirely realistic nor how the crime was handled. It wasn\u2019t terrible, it just felt a little lackadaisical. But her serial killer more than made up in the department of excellent and interesting characters.
