I do not know anymore what is my preference when it comes to books.When I was a kid, I wanted to read only books with pictures like the illustrated \"Alice in the Wonderland\" or \"Rip Van Winkle\". Until I read \"Silas Marner\" with no pictures and I said, wow, books with no pictures are also great! When I was a teenager, I said I don't like to read books that are hard to understand and read by adults until I read \"Lolita\" by Vladimir Nabokov and I said, wow, I did not know that there are authors who write this way! When I was a young man, I said I do not want thick books because I do not have time for them until I read \"War and Peace\" and \"The Fountainhead\" and I said, wow, thick books can be really engaging and finishing them can give you a different high! When I became a husband, my sex life became busy, I stopped heavy reading and concentrated on my job (not on copulating you silly) so I just grabbed some easy-read bestsellers like \"The Da Vinci Code\", \"The Kite Runner\" until my daughter came and I had to read some children's books to her and she loved them but I secretly hated them until I read to her \"The Little Prince\" and said, wow, there are still children's books that can speak to me even if I am a grown up man!When I became a middle-aged man, I discovered Goodreads. There is an option to screen members who apply to become your friend by asking the applicant a question. I thought then that the choice of genre was important so I chose this question: What is your favorite literary genre?\" and from then on, I have been accepting and ignoring invites based on his/her answer. I generally don't accept invites from people who say they don't have any preference. I thought that that kind of answer is wishy-washy or indecisive that reflects his or her not being a serious reader.Prior to last year, I said, I don't want to read fantasy books. I am too old for that. Until, I read the whole series of J.R.R.Tolkien's The Lord of the Rings and I say, wow, wow, wow, I did not know that I could still be amazed by a fantasy book about wizards, trolls, flying horse, monsters and little creatures! This book, The Secret Garden is a kind of book that I would not even consider reading. It is neither a 501 nor a 1001 book. The reason why I read this is that it is one of the Top 100 Favorite Books of The Filipino Group here at Goodreads. We challenged ourselves to read all the chosen books so I gave this a try.Story-wise, it is too sweeet. Saccharine corny. Predictable. Inappropriate for a middle-age man like me. Almost insulting to intelligence: feisty girl turns sweet girl. Sickly unwanted boy turns healthy. Then the boy and father embrace each other and profess love for one another. Hu hu hu. Books can just hit you without any warning. I was sad yet happy when I closed this book this morning. I think I am going crazy reading different books and experience all the different emotions while reading them. So I don't know anymore. I don't know what I like in books. No more preferences. Ask me now, what is my favorite genre. I don't know. But, the writing in this book is flawless. I have attended a novel-writing workshop last year and all the ingredients of a good novel are here: well-developed characters, each of them has his/her own distinct voice and transforming towards the end, milieu (the garden) is clearly described and very significant in the story, the internal and external conflicts are arranged like small-to-tall majorettes in a parade, the hooks at the end of each chapter, the climax, the falling action, the denouement ties up the loose ends from the conflicts. The theme is solid. The lessons, though corny, are school-textbook-kind of reminders: that love is important to make this world a better place and nature is beautiful so we have to take care of it.I guess my realization is this: yes, at some points in our lives, we tend to prefer some literary genres over the others. However, the genre is secondary to the writing. If the writer is good, no matter in which genre the book belongs, he/she should be read.\nIt is not the genre, it is the writing."}, {"userName": "Shayantani Das", "userReviewDate": "Jun 29, 2011", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/5686305-shayantani-das", "userReview": "Except for the persistent India bashing, I loved this book.

They represented a rite of passage for me as a person and as a reader. There is magic involved in coming-of-age stories where children strive to find the kind of life they are meant to live, against all odds, and I felt deeply satisfied each time I closed one of those books, knowing that the protagonists had (once again) made it through various challenges to live a better, more natural and fulfilled life.So far, so good. Some childhood classics are better left alone later, signifying a certain phase that can only be \"demystified\" by rereading, leading to bitter disappointment and loss of the initial enchantment. I hadn't touched The Secret Garden for decades, as I feared the slightly exaggerated, dramatised plot might put me off, and destroy the magic of my memory. But then I happened to discuss a phenomenon among students in a wealthy, over-privileged area. Many children and teenagers appear phlegmatic, angry, frustrated, lacking initiative to learn and develop, and they demand unreasonable attention without showing any willingness to commit to tasks themselves. We could not make sense of it, seeing that these students had \"everything they needed, and more\", and met with no restrictions or boundaries from their parents. Shouldn't they be happy? But they aren't. They are among the most neurotic, anxious children I have ever met.That's when The Secret Garden came to my mind again, - an early case study of childhood neglect in wealthy environments, in which children's physical and material needs are met, but their psychological development is completely left untouched. In The Secret Garden, it is the poor, but well-raised and deeply loved local boy who shows the spoiled, unhappy upper class children how to take on a responsible role for their life, and how to make active and positive decisions rather than throwing fits to let others step in and take over.Children need boundaries, and nurturing, and meaningful connections to their surroundings. If they are treated with fear and submission, they will turn into tyrants to see how far they can go before they receive some kind of direct attention, negative or positive. If they are handled with too much severity, they will duck and hide, and develop chameleon-like survival strategies. To create a happy, mature, and responsible human being, a balance between rights and duties must be struck, with limits the child knows it cannot overstep without facing consequences, and with areas of creative experimentation, where future freedom of choice can be safely practised.Just like a flower in a garden, a child needs both space, time and air, and a lot of nurturing, to blossom. I am grateful for the connection I found between my childhood reading pleasure and the everyday worries I face in my profession. A smile, a word of encouragement, a nudge in the right direction, all the small signs that show students that their teachers believe in their power to achieve great things - that's the magic of everyday life. And giving in to their tantrums is not helping those sensitive plants grow. It is stifling their development. When they claim they are too \"tired\" or \"bored\" to read The Secret Garden, and prefer to watch a movie version (if at all), they are in more dire need of overcoming the obstacle of long-term under-stimulation than the protagonists of the story itself. They need to be trained to love reading just like the two unhappy children in the mansion needed to be trained to show interest and care for the garden. Responsibility and care are acquired skills!"}, {"userName": "Ahmad Sharabiani", "userReviewDate": "Nov 13, 2012", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/614778-ahmad-sharabiani", "userReview": "The Secret Garden, Frances Hodgson BurnettThe Secret Garden is a children's novel by Frances Hodgson Burnett first published as a book in 1911, after a version was published as an American magazine serial beginning in 1910.

Mary Lennox, in hot, steamy , colonial India, and Colin Craven, he in rainy, cold, Yorkshire, northern England, a cripple, just before the start of the First World War, they don't even known the other exists, but will soon, both like to show contempt to servants, by yelling at them, while giving orders . Mary is spoiled, unhappy, and angry, her beautiful mother, loves parties, doesn't look kindly at the plain offspring , father too busy also, helping govern the enormous colony, truth be told, they dislike the unlovable girl. Cholera strikes and both parents fall, the little orphan child, is not emotionally attached to either one, and never a single drop of tears is shed...Shipped off, as quickly as possible, by the authorities, to her uncle Archibald Craven, in England, Colin's father, owner of an ancient, family mansion, ( 600 year- old) Misselthwaite Manor, with a hundred, mostly unused rooms, a decade previously, Mr. Craven lost his wife, (Mary and Colin mothers were sisters ) he adored , in an accident, and never recovered emotionally, his face always sad and mournful. The lord of the manor, is a frequent traveler abroad, he must get away from his bedridden, weak boy, it pains him to look at the pitiful sight and mostly does, when Colin is asleep....Mary, after a long, boring, escorted sea voyage, arrives, eventually, and lives alone in an isolated part of the mansion, Martha, a teenager, her servant, the only person she talks to, gives information about a secret garden, Mrs. Medlock, the housekeeper, like everyone else, ignores the unattractive girl, and hides her far from others, just the hired hands are there, after a quick visit to see her strange uncle, he leaves for foreign lands. Poor little Mary, nothing to do, but stare at the furniture... exploring the the grounds of the estate, the nearby, unnatural moors, outside, and somehow, finds the secret garden... later, after hearing again, weird, wailing sounds, coming through the walls, in her room, the rather frightened Mary, gets up in the middle of the night, down the dark, long , sinister corridors, enters an unknown room, and discovers a pathetic, depressed boy, in bed, her cousin Colin, that no one mentioned....They become close friends, after a few minor disagreements, life begins in reality, for the two children, at Mary's urging, she gets Colin outside for fresh air, with the help of a third, Martha's younger brother Dickon, 12, who animals love, a hidden door , opened , showing the eerie, gloomy, mysterious, dying secret garden, locked for ten years, by Mr.Craven, something dreadful occurred there, brave Mary is delighted though, she wants a beautiful, garden, with colorful roses, live trees, growing plants, birds singing, and flying, bees humming, butterflies floating, rabbits jumping, squirrels climbing, crows cawing, brilliant flowers springing up in all sections of the Secret Garden..and people lying on the green grass, sightseeing, looking at the bluest of the blue, the sky above. They have hoes, the children, let the plowing and weeding begin...A children's classic, that can be read and enjoyed by adults, rejuvenation of the human spirit, with a simple act of planting a few seeds in the ground, yet more than just exotic flowers coming above the dirt, the most precious commodity on the Earth may also spring into existence, life for the soul."}, {"userName": "Todd", "userReviewDate": "Aug 22, 2007", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/300992-todd", "userReview": "I know this book seems out of place among the fare I usually read, but hey, all I can say is that I like what I like. There is some intangible quality to this book that really strikes a chord in me. The whole idea of that sickly child being healed with love, attention, and (forgive me an LDS joke) wholesome recreational activities, just somehow speaks Truth to me. I think this book has strong application to today's problems with the rising generation. I really believe that kids these days are getting fatter, less healthy, and less disciplined. I think that a good romp on the heather and a breath of fresh air would do kids a lot of good.On another level, I really believe that some people are only as sick as they think they are. Working in the healthcare field, it's obvious to me that some people find it quite easy to take the role of a victim. Again, this book speaks Truth concerning the value of attitude and perspective in overcoming perceived problems and finding out that they weren't as bad as you thought they were."}, {"userName": "Manybooks", "userReviewDate": "Nov 23, 2009", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/2970379-manybooks", "userReview": "I first read this wonderful and evocative absolute and utter gem of a story at around age twelve or thirteen (it was likely one of the first longer novels I read entirely in English, not counting those books read for school). I simply adored Frances Hodgson Burnett's The Secret Garden when I read it as a young teenager (or rather, a tween), I continued to love it when I reread it multiple times while at university, and I still massively loved the novel when I reread the story for the Children's Literature Group in 2011 (and I much continue to love it, having reread it at least twice or so since then).I honestly think that I enjoyed The Secret Garden even more as an adult than the times I read the novel when I was younger (and that is saying an awful lot). When I first read The Secret Garden as a young teenager, I was definitely enchanted by the garden (and of course, the Robin), and I really liked and enjoyed reading about the Sowerbys, but I did kind of consider both Mary and Colin as somewhat spoiled and selfish (I understood their problems and felt some empathy, but I also felt more than a bit annoyed at and by them, something that I certainly did not experience as much during my adult rereads). As an adult reader, I actually and firmly believe that most, if not all of both Mary's and Colin's problems and behavioural quirks (be they emotional or physical) are the result of parental abandonment and emotional neglect (maybe even abuse). They act and react towards the world the way the world (or at least how most of the world) has always acted and reacted towards them. And without the garden, but also without characters like Martha, Susan and Dickon Sowerby, without Ben Weatherstaff and the Robin, there would never have been any change in and for Mary (or at least, not enough change), and by extension, there would never have been any change in and for Colin and his father either.One interesting and thought-provoking fact presented in The Secret Garden is that there actually seems to be a real and almost palpable absence of nurturing father figures throughout (except maybe Dickon, but he is just a boy and in many ways resembles more a Pan-like nature deity, and Ben Weatherstaff really is too old and curmudgeonly to be considered nurturing and fatherly). We do have quite a number of nurturing mother figures portrayed who aid Mary, and later Colin in their recovery (Susan and Martha Sowerby, and even Mary later becomes somewhat of a motherly and nurturing figure towards Colin), but we never see or hear much about a Mr. Sowerby (he is a complete nonentity). And while much is made of the fact that Mary Lennox' mother did not seem to want her child (a fact that is rightfully criticised), the fact that Mr. Lennox did not trouble himself much about his daughter either, while mentioned briefly, is seemingly accepted as a given (or at least much more accepted). Also, while the fact that Mr. Craven has spiritually and emotionally abandoned Colin, and cannot stand to see him when he's awake because his son's eyes remind him of the boy's dead mother is noted in the novel, this rather vile and nasty attitude and behaviour is not (at least in my humble opinion) subject to nearly the same amount of harsh criticism that Mary's emotional and spiritual abandonment by her mother is. I know that the death of Mr. Craven's wife was traumatic for him, but both Mr. Carven's and Mrs. Lennox' actions, or rather their lack of love and acceptance towards their children have had horrible psychological (and psychosomatic) consequences, basically turning both of them into emotional cripples, and Colin into a hysterical hypochondriac who thinks he has a crooked back. The Secret Garden clearly and lastingly demonstrates that children (no, anyone) can only show love, can only be lovable, if they have experienced love themselves. In the beginning of the novel, Mary is described as tyrannical, unpleasant, thoroughly \"unlovable\" and also as somewhat odd. But how can Mary know anything about love, if she has never experienced love? Her parents certainly do not seem to want her, and she has basically been abandoned to the care of servants, who have also been instructed to keep Mary out of the way as much as possible (and in her innermost soul, Mary likely realises this and much and rightly resents this). Mary's temper tantrums towards her Ayah and other servants, her desire to always get her own way, are not merely Mary imitating the behaviour she witnesses among the ex-pat community in India (although that likely also has a part to play). I believe in many ways, the servants act as representatives of her absent parents, and by lashing out at the servants, Mary is also lashing out at her careless, unloving, absent parents by proxy.And even when Mary first arrives at Misselthwaite, there is still a real and ever-present danger that she will never be able to change, to emerge out of her shell (or to change enough, for at least in England, Mary has the opportunity to go outside and play/run, which was not possible in India due to the hot, stiflingly humid climate); many of the inhabitants of the manor, but especially Mrs. Medlock and Mr. Craven regard Mary, or seem to regard Mary the same way that her parents did, either not at all, or as a cumbersome, even loathsome burden. Without Martha, Dickon, and the influence of Martha's mother (Mrs. Sowerby), and of course, Ben Weatherstaff and the Robin (who is a bird, but might just represent the spirit of Colin's deceased mother), not much would likely have ever changed for Mary or within Mary. There might well have been some physical improvement of her health, but her mental health, her soul, would likely have remained for the most part sour and disagreeable.I have to admit that I do have a bit of a problem with the fact that so many of the adults portrayed in The Secret Garden (even individuals like Martha and Susan Sowerby) keep bringing up the fact that Mary's mother was supposedly very physically attractive, and that in many ways, Mary is often judged negatively because she is plain, while her mother was considered very beautiful. However, Mary's mother does not in any way care about or for her daughter, and had, in fact, never wanted a daughter; her careless, unloving attitude (and that of her husband as well) is reflected in Mary's countenance, her whole being. Thus, even though Mrs. Lennox might have been physically sweet looking, she basically has a careless and unloving and massively sour (read ugly) soul, which is reflected in her daughter (both spiritually and physically).This \"Norton Critical Edition\" of The Secret Garden (which seems to have been published in 2006) is to be most highly recommended, especially for anyone interested in both the novel (the narrative) and its historical contexts, diverse critical voices etc., as it provides not only the text proper (which is simply and utterly magical, of course), but also much supplemental information and materials about Frances Hodgson Burnett and her timeless literary classic. And although I do not think that this edition lists every piece of extant literary criticism on The Secret Garden, there truly and fortunately is a goodly amount presented, as well as a solid, although not extensive selected bibliography (being a more than adequate starting point for serious academic study and research)."}, {"userName": "Dannii Elle", "userReviewDate": "Sep 02, 2015", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/44487975-dannii-elle", "userReview": "Actual rating 4.5/5 stars.I have vivid memories of reading this renowned children's classic when I was very young. I can distinctly recall my shock at reading a book with such an initially dislikable protagonist, the likes of which I had not yet discovered during my few years of reading. I was intrigued by the petulant Mary Lennox and was enchanted by her discovery of the secret garden. This, I believe, was my my first introduction to dark and brooding main characters, and probably even honed my later love for female Gothic fiction, so I am eternally indebted to it, for that.It has now been many years since my young repeated readings of this book and I tried to divorce these emotions from my present reading. Whether or not I was successful I could not say, but this still entranced me just as much as it did as a child.

Primarily, it's about three kids: Mistress Mary, Dickon, and Master Colin--and how just thinking a little differently can change a person completely.There's a lot of subtle things Frances Hodgson Burnett does right: The way she relates the Garden to Colin's mother and how that affects his relationship with his father--and how all of these things have made him a horribly spoiled brat. That thinking a little differently, and getting some fresh air, and fixing up a Secret Garden can simultaneously fix up his life and his relationship with his father.Even though it packs a nice punch and does a lot of little things right, the story overall is a tough read. And it goes beyond just being dated and having awkwardly constructed sentences. It's more than the dialogue and the Yorkshire accent most of the characters speak with that makes what they're trying to say almost impossible to decipher for a modern English speaker.The pacing is awful. There really isn't any conflict. So it's REALLY hard to get into.

Several revelations so far: One, the plot is basically JANE EYRE, with an asexual Rochester who keeps, not his wife, but his son, in the attic. Two, it's surprisingly easy to read the characters of both Mary and Colin as being on the autistic spectrum. (Her rudeness; her insensitivity to others, her obsessiveness: his tantrums; his introspection; his obsessions.) Three; the pantheism and everyday magic of the story is a lot more sophisticated than I realized as a child, as is the depiction of Nature and the landscape - quite Bronte-like in its intensity. Unexpected moment of joy: the many occasions on which young Mary exclaims with delight that she is getting fatter - fat repeatedly held up as a positive - a refreshing change from so many of the dysmorphic, anxious young girls of contemporary fiction. One jarring note to the modern reader: Mary's attitude towards the people of India; an uncomfortable reminder of the casual racism and arrogance of British colonialism.

Occasionally I pick a Librivox audiobook book based on who the reader is, for this version of The Secret Garden, it is read by Karen Savage, one of the few professional level readers who have graciously narrated entire books for Librivox\u2019s public domain audiobooks. Listen to a sample and you will understand. I didn\u2019t really know anything about The Secret Garden, the title did ring a bell but I had no idea what it is about. I was hoping it is a garden where weirdness ensues and corpses pile up, perhaps with a trowel embedded. Alas, no, quite the opposite really. Had I known that it is a children\u2019s book I would not have read it, but by the time shockingly nice things happen I was already under the book\u2019s\u2014and Karen Savage\u2019s\u2014spell. I was thinking \u201clooks like I\u2019m in for a nice time, oh dear\u201d.Like a lot of people today I am somewhat cynical, I think you would have to be insane to think the world is a particularly nice place to live in at the moment. Still, that is what escapism through fiction is all about. So, OK, I\u2019m game, just let me put these on.That\u2019s better! In this wonderful world that we live in there are often delightful surprises, discount coupons for our favorite snacks, gift cards, terrific free audiobooks etc. (I\u2019ve run out of examples). The Secret Garden is about that, if you look at life with a kind eye and optimism, you will surprise at what the universe will give back to you (especially if you have the glasses I\u2019m wearing). At the beginning of The Secret Garden ten-year-old Mary Lennox is living with her mother in India, lording over the poor natives. One fine morning she wakes to find everybody in her house either dead from cholera or gone off to look for some places without quite so much cholera in them. Fortunately, some British soldiers pick her up and she is soon transported to her uncle\u2019s isolated mansion called Misselthwaite Manor in Yorkshire, pre-Brexit UK. Little Mary is sometimes called \u201cMistress Mary Quite Contrary\u201d because in those bygone days the term \u201cpain in the ass\u201d has yet to be coined. She basically hates everybody she comes across, mostly due to parental neglect. \u201cPerhaps if her mother had carried her pretty face and her pretty manners oftener into the nursery Mary might have learned some pretty ways too\u201dHowever, she soon finds the lovely clean air of Yorkshire agrees with her, and a nice maid gives her a skipping rope which is \u201cth' sensiblest toy a child can have\u201d. She soon begins to mellow and even find that some people are not so bad.\u201cI like you, and you make the fifth person. I never thought I should like five people.\u201d. One day when Mary Less-Contrary-Than-Before is skipping around she finds the eponymous locked up secret garden and a little robin helps her finds the key, because that is what robins do. Mary is enchanted by the neglected garden, she sees all sorts of possibilities in it, perhaps it would be a great place to set up a fight club. Soon she meets young Dickon, the brother of her maid Martha, who knows all about gardening and can charm animals (not so much a talent as a bear necessity), soon after making that acquaintance she discovers a young boy living secretly in Misselthwaite. He is Colin Craven, the son of her uncle who owns the mansion. Colin is in a different league of contrariness from Mary at her worst. When he is not shouting, screaming, or throwing tantrums he sulks quietly to recharge his battery for the next mega-brat session. Fortunately, Mary shows him\u2014with a lot of help from Dickon\u2014the error of his ways and even discovers the error of her own ways. Gardening is the key.As someone who is not keen on gardening (I just don\u2019t dig \u2018em) I had to suspend my disbelief that pottering and frolicking about a garden can bring so many psychological and health benefits. Colin is introduced as an invalid and Mary\u2019s secret garden project turns out to be just what the doctor failed to order. If you are a fan of this book you may get the impression that I am mocking it in my 21st century cynical ways, but really I am not. I am quite charmed by the \u201cmagical realism\u201d of this book with its semi-Disneyesque animals psychic-linked to Dikon, subtly supernatural goings on, and kids slowly recovering their health and humanity. What\u2019s not to like? It is all very nice and the ending is very pat (if somewhat abrupt) but I don\u2019t need to be a cynic 24/7.My favorite aspect of The Secret Garden is what  George Eliot describes as \u201cunfolding of the soul\u201d in Silas Marner. It is a wonderful thing when you see it in real life, in fiction\u2014when it is effectively depicted\u2014it can be quite moving and even inspirational. I like how Mary learns to get on and even like people through receiving their kindness and how Colin finds his humanity through making a friend and getting some fresh air. If I was a hypochondriac the idea of gardening would not appeal to me, but I am not a character in this book and I am glad gardening has this therapeutic effect for them.Finally, I ought to say something about Frances Hodgson Burnett's writing; this is my first experience of it. It is not high literature like Dickens or Austen, but it is a thing of beauty. Deceptively simple yet full of charm, warmth, sincerity and even goodwill to all man. The Yorkshire dialect in some of the dialogue is delightfully written and the meaning is never obscured (some of the harder to guess ones are directly explained). Her style is clearly not for the hardcore cynic, but then if you are a hardcore cynic perhaps you should give it a rest.Do I recommend this book? Of course I do, either read it or go run about in the sun, it will do you a world of good!_____________________Note:There is an abridged audiobook version* read by nonother than the time traveling and very lovely Jenna Coleman, I have that version too. Our Clara Jen does a very spirited narration, though she does not put Karen Savage in the shade, both of them can stay out in the sun (uh, in a good way. This metaphor is getting out of control!). However, the abridged version is too short for my liking, only about one hour long, so I would only recommend it to Clara lovin' Whovians or Victoria  fans.*A copy of this review has been automatically mirrored there by the GR Gremlin."}, {"userName": "Helene Jeppesen", "userReviewDate": "Apr 04, 2017", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/21992464-helene-jeppesen", "userReview": "This is a lot of people's favourite children's classic, and for that reason I was very intrigued to read it. Having now finished it, I'm convinced that had I grown up with this story as a child, I would've been even more enchanted by it than I was now, reading it for the first time as an adult. I'm not going to go into any details as to why I didn't absolutely love this book, simply because I didn't feel like anything was necessarily wrong with it. It was a good and sweet story about changes and the way you look at things, people and life, and it was endearing to read about the protagonist's journey as well as the secret garden. I will say, though, that this story reminded me a lot of another book I read recently and didn't really like: \"The Forgotten Garden\" by Kate Morton. I'm sure Morton was inspired by this classic to write her story, but maybe that connection decresed my reading experience of this one. It's hard to say, but for now let's just say that I liked \"The Secret Garden\" but it didn't manage to find a place near to my heart, unfortunately."}, {"userName": "Jolene", "userReviewDate": "Aug 30, 2017", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/8171153-jolene", "userReview": "\"There's naught as nice as th' smell o' good clean earth, except th' smell o' fresh growin' things when th' rain falls on 'em.

I don't really understand why it became a classic. It starts out interestingly enough with a very gothic setting. A little British girl named Mary survives a cholera epidemic in India and is sent to Yorkshire to live with her distant relatives. The author gives a vivid description of the beauty of the moors and the mysterious mansion that the girl goes to live in. The only other interesting part is really when Mary discovers the boy who she hears crying in the mansion and when she discovers the secret garden. Everything else beyond that (which is most of the book) isn't all that interesting. The author spends many pages explaining how miraculous and magic fresh air is for healing and fattening up the crying boy and the girl who escaped the cholera epidemic in India. The bits that get old after a while: Oh, look, it's a garden! Look, I can run and play! I'm not a cripple after all! Look at the pretty birds! The garden is alive! Now I have an appetite! Isn't it a magical miracle that I'm having fun playing outside?I just wasn't really impressed."}, {"userName": "Alison", "userReviewDate": "Jun 25, 2008", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/124482-alison", "userReview": "I seem to be the only woman I know who didn't read and cherish this book as a child. So I decided to see what all the fuss was about...It took me a while to get in step with the tone of this book. The beginning was Jane Eyre-lite...Mary is orphaned and sent from India to England to live with her uncle, a stranger to her. The story progresses...and then....Mary's talking to a robin, and he's showing her where buried keys are. At that point, the mood shifted, and I sat back to enjoy not a literary masterpiece, but a child's fantasy adventure.I really lost myself in the beauty of the Secret Garden...it's natural beauty and the idea of its powers to cleanse our physical and spiritual sides. One review claimed that re-visiting this made the reader want to \"get back into gardening\"...and I felt that. It's a gardener's story--a tale for someone who enjoys the process, from planting the seeds to appreciating the beauty of the end product. I loved the vivid descriptions of all the particular plants, trees, and animals...But if I'm being honest, this book got a bit intense for me. As Colin begins to feel the healing powers of the garden...as he begins to chant and sing his praises to the \"magic\"...(and on and on about \"the magic\"), I really began to feel the author's personal philosphies taking over. The introduction suggests that Burnett infused the comfort she found in Christian Science teachings after her son died into this story about the power of mind over body. Hmmmm. I think what kept me from totally being sold on this novel is that I did try to read it as an adult. I was unable to enjoy the narrative literally and at face-value. I was digging in....always watchful for the deeper meaning. And Burnett's ideas were already at the surface, perhaps a little heavy-handedly at times.Overall...a nice story, perhaps best enjoyed through the innocent, unaffected eyes of a child."}, {"userName": "Merna ", "userReviewDate": "Feb 17, 2013", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/16392157-merna", "userReview": "[Take a guess.

She is sent to Misselthwaite Manor a 100 room mansion that is surrounded by the gloomy moors to live with her uncle. Mary encounters many odd things for her, Mrs Medlock, Martha, putting on her own clothes, being told what to do, Ben, a robin, weird crying sounds, Secrets, the Manor, Martha's Mother, gardening, Secrets, skipping rope, a key, Dickon, Secrets, and finally Colin. Mary learns to love the gardens and adores Dickon, who absorbs life in the country surrounded by the animals and flowers (nature). Mary finds a hidden room in her uncle\u2019s house where she meets Colin and finds out that she is his cousin and alot like she was when she first arrived, a brat. Colin, who has not left his room since his birth and the death of his mother. He believes what he has overheard, hunchback, ill-fated and death is a given. I believe Mary sees herself in Colin and makes it her mission to help him be a normal boy.Mary and Dickon decide to take him into the \"Secret Garden\" to make him feel. The Novel is loaded with life, death, sickness and health, and brings a unique perspective that a child just need to be a child. Mary, Dickon and Colin discover friendship, the beauty of nature and life, all strangers in the beginning. The beauty of the story is: it does not feel like a Novel written in 1911. I know two boys who play outside, in the sand box, in the dirt, with hand shovels digging, sticks, and bug boxes instead of tablets playing video games. Let the imagination BLOOM!Some advice?

to finally read this. And have now I love re-reading it. I loved the movies based on the book and now I have read it to see which version is the most accurate to the story. Frances Burnett made the characters fun, easy and enjoyable to read about! I especially liked the various point-of-views you read. From the staff, gardeners, and even the bird! Normally I don't like too many POVs but this works nicely with smooth transitions. It is a peaceful, relaxing story to enjoy."}, {"userName": "Vicki", "userReviewDate": "Jul 29, 2015", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/8085705-vicki", "userReview": "This is a book I have read over and over again. With the lovely characters that grow in stature, strength, and wisdom through the book, it is a wonderful progression. From the moment you meet pinched faced Mary, you come to love the little girl that has lost so much. Her sadness has become a part of her and one that she struggles to throw off. Her curiosity is lovely and brings Colin and Dicken into the picture. What a lovely lively trio they are. Each one overcoming great sadness, pain and solitude. This book gave my heart wings. I was a sad child until I read The Secret Garden. Then I began to search for happiness just as Mary had taught. This book was life changing for me as a small child and continues to raise the bar in my search for happiness."}, {"userName": "Amy | shoutame", "userReviewDate": "Aug 31, 2016", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/10559838-amy-shoutame", "userReview": "I can't believe I have taken this long to read this book. The Secret Garden is one of my all time favourite films from when I was younger, I can always remember it being on the TV of a Sunday afternoon so I had a feeling I would love the book just as much.We follow the young Mary Lennox as she is sent over from India to live with her Uncle in England, this is due to the fact that both of Mary's parents have passed away and she has nowhere else to go. We soon learn that Mary is a pretty unlikable child with many issues stemming from that fact that she has only ever been waited on hand and foot and never spent time with children her own age. Whilst trying to adapt to her new life in England Mary is left to occupy herself in the large gardens of her Uncle's estate, this is how she hears of the secret garden that no one has entered in ten years. Mary sets out to discover the whereabouts of the secret garden and the adventure begins there!This is truly such a wonderful novel, I think Frances Hodgson Burnett writes brilliantly endearing characters and Mary is definitely one of those! This is a classic that everyone should have on their shelves."}, {"userName": "Simon", "userReviewDate": "Jan 12, 2012", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/211278-simon", "userReview": "****SPOILERS****OK, I must have read and loved this book 40 or so years ago. (Yikes!) I liked it a lot this time round, but it was troubling to me in several ways. It starts off as the story of Mary, a girl suffering from epic neglect. (Her entire household in Colonial India, parents, servants, everyone, die from cholera or flee the house with no-one bothering to think about her, leaving her alone, not knowing what's happening, if anyone is there, scavenging for food from unfinished meals on the table. How's that for a brutal opening of a (children's) novel?) The description of her neglect is so clear and strong that one cannot help but feel that the author must feel some sympathy for her character, but amazingly, she dwells on her unpleasantness to such an extent that one can't be sure she isn't censuring her strongly.Well, it starts off as Mary's story, and one is prepared for the 'coming alive' she is going to experience, when.... the damn thing gets hijacked by Colin, a little boy at her uncle's house in Yorkshire (where she is sent) who is her male counterpart, his mother dead at or near his birth, shunned by his self-absorbed father, loathed by the army of nurses and doctors over whom he rules tyrannically by virtue of their desire to prevent his tantrums. Well, it's hijacked by Colin, but it's hijacked again, right at the very end, by Colin's father whose own unpleasantness, though less obvious than Colin's and Mary's, is certainly more culpable in that his began in adulthood and led him simply to forget the existence of his son. But, happily, through Mary's work on Colin, and Colin's own working of what he calls Magic, the paterfamilias and his male heir are finally restored to happiness, Mary entirely forgotten. And there's Dickon, the young peasant boy who is the symbol of the healing powers of nature. He absolves the function of the Magic Negro here, an oppressed outsider (by virtue of class here, not race) whose wisdom and power is harnessed by, and makes his (and his family's) poverty somehow less awful to, the ruling class. His fate, after the novel, was almost certainly to be killed in the trenches of Flanders, probably as Colin's batman. (Colin's right to order everyone around, Dickon, Mary, the old gardener Ben Weatherstaff, the doctor, is never questioned.)And the Magic! Obviously there's a lot of good sense in Burnett's views about health and happiness - nature, care for animals and plants, eating well, fresh air and exercise, but there's a new-agey self-help side to it that gets a bit nauseous: repeating over and over to yourself \"yes, I can,\" having one good thought a day, etc. etc."}, {"userName": "Cheryl", "userReviewDate": "Jan 05, 2014", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/11255849-cheryl", "userReview": "Frances Hodgson Burnett looked to gardening for healing from grief and mental collapse--she also believed in metaphysical healing. Every day she wrote in a \"walled rose garden.\" She loved reading Dickens and Charlotte Bronte. It shows in this book. Nature and fresh air--all symbolisms. How can someone write about these simple elements and leave you interested? They throw in a couple of children protagonists who are psychologically and physically healed from a hidden, charitable garden. They sprinkle some Yorkshire dialect. Then add a story that moves with masterful pacing. Little Miss Mary is all but contrary. She is an inspirational heroine who it turns out isn't trying to be disagreeable, but is trying to carve her space in a world that has never seemed to embrace her since birth. She is authentic--even though during the Victorian age upper-class children were expected to behave like miniature adults, so at times she comes off saying some things that sound beyond her age. Both she and Colin, the young boy who is also a hypochondriac, are convincing nineteenth-century characters. Mary is a brat in the beginning, a child abandoned by her parents, who lacks people skills. Yet you still get to like her. How, I'm not sure. I guess it speaks to Burnett's talents as a writer. Sure, I could have done without the references to how ugly the child was. I also could have done without the antagonistic inferences to Indians as \"blacks\" and inferior (honestly, had it overwhelmed the story and been more than character-inner-thought highlighted through a couple of short dialogue interchanges, I would have taken more than a star away and stopped reading--classic or not). Then agin, there is the context to keep in mind: Burnett writes about the era after the Battle of Plassey in 1757, when India fell under British rule, she places Mary's father as a member of the British colonial administration in India (started during the 1700s I believe). India gained independence in 1948 and this book was first published around 1911. So there you have it. Mary returned to London from India after her family died of cholera (again Burnett is writing about the huge cholera outbreak in India between 1898 and 1907 that killed over 300,000 people), and was greeted with some standoffishness: she was the \"child from India, \" and so surely, something must have been different about her since no one around her knew anything about that part of the world--except for the negative things they had heard. Frankly, you even sense that Burnett also doesn't know much about the country or its people. And yet the story of the two children, Mary and Colin--even Dickon--is an endearing one about the ever-changing world of a child, and a rare glimpse into the psychological realism of the young protagonist."}], "description": "The Secret Garden, by Frances Hodgson Burnett, is part of the Barnes & Noble Classics\u00a0series, which offers quality editions at affordable prices to the student and the general reader, including new scholarship, thoughtful design, and pages of carefully crafted extras.
