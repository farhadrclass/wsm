I was thrilled to get a copy of Tender Vow thru FIRST Wild Card Tours, and am really glad I did. I fell in love with all of the characters from page one (with the exception of Candace!), but I especially loved Rachel's 3-year-old daughter, Meagan. She's a real hoot! You never know what will come out of her mouth next, just like my 3-year-old nephew. :)Tender Vow covers quite a range of emotions, from Rachel's heart-break over the tragic loss of her husband at such a young age, to Jason's deep-seated love for his sister-in-law. Anger and hurt feeling also play a large part in the Evans family's healing process -- it seems as though Jason's dad blames him for his brother's death, and they have a tough time repairing their relationship. God really does bring something good out of tragedy, as we see Jason find his way back to His heavenly Father as he continuously deals with his guilt over the death of his brother, John. We get to see God's hand at work as Jason tries his best to take care of Rachel and her children, but at the same time, give her the space she needs to properly deal with her loss. In the end, God sees fit to bless them both with the desires of their hearts, but in His own time."}, {"userName": "Sue Morris", "userReviewDate": "Feb 08, 2011", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/4270710-sue-morris", "userReview": "A Christian story of grief, hope, redemption and mostly love. The story is told from two points of view, switching between the male and female protagonists. For the most part this works well. Rachel has just lost her husband, John, to a skiing accident. Both families are devastated, including John's brother Jason who was on the ski trip when the tragedy occurred. Guilt ridden, Jason wants to help Rachel any way he can. Old feelings surface. Jason wants to rekindle old feelings and Rachel does not, but with a 3-year-old precocious daughter and a newborn son, Rachel needs Jason's help. Reluctantly, feelings surface on both sides. What will the families say? Is this even \"right?\" Can Rachel and Jason figure out what is the best thing to so: follow their hearts or keep an appropriate distance? This is a page-turner which both those who like Christian books and those that do not will surely enjoy. \"Tender Vows\" is a classic love story with interesting twists. A most enjoyable read. You won't want to put the book down and when finished will want a sequel detailing the future of both these families.Received from Publisher"}, {"userName": "Renee", "userReviewDate": "Apr 18, 2010", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/2965894-renee", "userReview": "3.5 starsI'm a huge fan of Sharlene MacLaren and her historical series'. She has a terrific writing style and a way of making you feel connected to the characters. I thought that I would really enjoy her latest contemporary romance, Tender Vow. Unfortunately it was a little hard for me to get into this book. Don't get me wrong, it was worth reading but something was missing! I'm not sure what though, it just didn't set right with me. I'm not usually like this when I read, I can pick out clear cut reasons as to why I did or did not like a book. It was excellent as far as a great Christian message of a family relying more strongly upon God after a tragedy. It also had some romantic moments that sizzled. Maybe it was the rather abrupt ending that bugged me. In spite of that I still recommend Sharlene MacLaren to everyone who is looking for sweet romances (my review of her latest historical, Abbie Ann). She is still one of my very favorite authors. I can't wait for her next historical series, River of Hope coming in 2011!Special thanks to Cathy Hickling of Whitaker House for sending me a review copy."}, {"userName": "Janna", "userReviewDate": "Sep 26, 2010", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/1705916-janna", "userReview": "Shar Maclaren has written some of my favorite historical romance books of all time. She has 2 separate series that were so good I was always on the edge of my seat waiting for the next one to come out (Daughters of Jacob Kane series and Little Hickman Creek series). While her historical books capture the essence of the time periods and places to me, her contemporary romances don't pack the same punch for me. Tender Vow is a nice story with nice characters and some little twists in the plot (nothing too big) but the whole concept of the widow of one man falling in love with her husband's brother just didn't sit quite right with me. It was probably a personal thing and there will be tons of people that love this book. For me, I will continue to be first in line for every historical book Sharlane Maclaren writes, but I won't be in as a big a hurry to get the contemporary books."}, {"userName": "Holly (2 Kids and Tired)", "userReviewDate": "Feb 11, 2011", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/584266-holly-2-kids-and-tired", "userReview": "I loved Sharlene's Daughters of Jacob Kane series and so I was curious about reading more from her. This is a sweet story about love and forgiveness. Sharlene did a great job of capturing the grief that surrounds loss and the exploration of new feelings as people move forward. The Christian elements are strong, with Rachel and Jason both learning how to listen to the voice of God in their lives. The novel is somewhat light and a bit predictable, despite the subject matter, but it is still a sweet story. Perfect for an afternoon escape."}, {"userName": "June", "userReviewDate": "May 29, 2012", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/9873203-june", "userReview": "This was my introduction to Sharlene MacLaren back in 2012 (before I started reviewing everything I read.) :) This was an amazing book. The story telling style of this lady is amazing. I really hated when the story ended, but was glad to see that she had written other books I hadn't read yet and my journey began. Today I eagerly await her next book coming out and am really glad I decided to read Tender Vow. It's lead to a lot of other great stories, both historical and contemporary."}, {"userName": "Carman", "userReviewDate": "Sep 08, 2010", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/2527853-carman", "userReview": "Tender Vow definitely captured my emotions! I felt like I was connected to the characters, and I really was interested in their story. This is a sweet, gives-you-happy-feelings kind of book.

Absolutely. Sharlene MacLaren's ability to weave a story full of believable experiences with realistic dialogue is amazing. A tragic death, sibling rivalry, suffocating grief, single parenting, and redeeming love; it's all in \"Tender Vow\".
