This book has solidified his place as my #1 Favorite author! And I do not hand that award out lightly! He had me both cheering and weeping, out loud. Once again, I read it all in one sitting. I literally had to force myself to put the book down just to make dinner. Do not let my speed-reading fool you, I read it in one sitting because it is such an amazing and perfect book! No matter what direction he takes, I will be a life-long fan. I will recommend ALL of Jack's books to everyone I know. Whether you are a fan of zombies and horror or not, you will fall in love with Jack's humor and his charming way with words. There really is nothing more you could ask for! With some book series, one could get bored. NOT WITH JACK! He always finds new ways to kill the zombies and new twists and turns you won't see coming! It doesn't get any better then this! At least, not until the next book in series comes out! :)"}, {"userName": "Yeidy", "userReviewDate": "Aug 26, 2012", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/4001739-yeidy", "userReview": "With baby Jacob on board, Bethany's new role as a mommy keeps adding fuel to the zombie apocalypse fire!
