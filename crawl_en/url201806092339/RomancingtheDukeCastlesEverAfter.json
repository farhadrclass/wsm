It left me with a goofy grin and eyes misted over with stupid unshed tears. It makes me want to believe in starlit kisses, in moonlit romance. It makes me want my own fairy tale.Goddamn it. This book was just too fucking cute.Yes, I realize that the cursing is completely uncalled for!! Let me curse!! I need an element of foulness in order to retain the vestiges of my usual anger and bitterness. This book has left me a silly, sappy fool, and I can't say I regret it.I regret nothing.The Summary: With a name like Isolde Ophelia Goodnight and a father who wrote a series of children's stories, you would expect Izzy's life to be a fairy tale.It wasn't.Isolde prefers to be known as Izzy. Izzy is not ugly, but neither is she a beauty. No Prince Charming has ever shown up for her. And at 26, her life is as far removed from enchantment as you can imagine. Life---and romance, has always passed her by.\nAnd for as long as she could remember, Izzy had been waiting\u2014with dwindling faith and increasing impatience\u2014for that part of her life to begin.\nInstead of a charmed life, Izzy is now a spinster. Her father is dead. She is broke; completely destitute. She has no home. She hasn't eaten in days. Izzy is no longer a girl with stars in her eyes. Her present is cold, harsh reality.\nHer cravings for romance were gone. Now she\u2019d settle for bread. What fairy tales were left over for a plain, impoverished, twenty-six-year-old woman who\u2019d never even been kissed?\nRight now, Izzy's entire existence hinges on a letter, a letter that arrived, promising her survival. Her late godfather has left her a bequest.That bequest, as befitting a fairy-tale girl, is a castle. But it's not an enchanted castle, by any means. It probably needs an exorcism, more than anything.\nThis castle didn\u2019t welcome or enchant.It loomed.It menaced.She almost worried it might pounce.\nAnd that castle comes with its own beast. A crippled, blind, scarred duke. A monstrous, terrifying masterpiece.\nThere were things in nature that took their beauty from delicate structure and intricate symmetry. Flowers. Seashells. Butterfly wings. And then there were things that were beautiful for their wild power and their refusal to be tamed. Snowcapped mountains. Churning thunderclouds. Shaggy, sharp-toothed lions.This man silhouetted before her? He belonged, quite solidly, in the latter category.\nWell, shit. The castle in question is his, and Ransom, half-monster and 100% man---is naturally, not that eager to hand it over to her. The castle has been in his family for generations, and due to a misunderstanding, it has been sold. Now, his ancestral home has been handed over to a chit of a girl, and damned if Ransom's going to hand it over on a silver platter.Nope.Ransom has a comfortable life as a secluded hermit---as fairy tale Beasts often do, and the last thing he wants is a woman invading HIS personal space. Nope. Nope. Nope. He literally throws Izzy out.\n\u201cThat\u2019s it,\u201d he said, at length. \u201cYou\u2019re leaving this place the same way you came in.\u201dHe ducked, caught her by the legs, and threw her over his shoulder\u2014with the ease of a man who\u2019d tossed many a woman over his shoulder. This was definitely not his first go at lady-tossing.\nUnfortunately for him, Izzy is not the frail, shrinking violet sort he expected.Izzy may have the name of a damsel in a fairy tale, but she is a grown woman. She is hungry, she is desperate, she has nowhere else to go, and this woman is standing her ground.\nHe bounced her weight, plumping her backside with his forearm. \u201cThere\u2019s so little to you.\u201d\u201cYou\u2019re wrong,\u201d she said. \u201cThere\u2019s a great deal to me, Your Grace. More than you know. More than anyone supposes. You can carry me outside, if you like. I\u2019ll come back in. Again, and again. As many times as it takes. Because this is my castle now. And I\u2019m not leaving.\u201d\nRansom and Izzy comes to an uneasy agreement. She will stay and be his secretary and sort out his long-neglected correspondances (blind men can't really answer letters), as well as figure out the legal fiasco that led to his castle being sold in the first place.He pays her very well---200 pounds a day, the sooner she figures it out, the sooner they can move on with their life. Only there's just one problem. Izzy starts to grow on him. The easiest way to get to a man's heart is through his belly...and Izzy can make pancakes. Pancakes.\nShe poked around, making busy clanging noises. \u201cI don\u2019t suppose there are eggs? If I do say it myself, I make a very good pancake.\u201dOh, no. This just grew worse and worse.I make a very good pancake.Appalling.What was even more appalling was that Ransom found himself suddenly hungry for a very good pancake. Starving. Ravenous. Damn it, he was faint with yearning for a very good pancake.\nAll alarms are sounding inside Ransom's head. This woman is dangerous. I MEAN, PANCAKES. His instincts are screaming at him. GET. OUT. NOW.\nGet out now. The threat is coming from inside the castle.\nNaturally, they find themselves gradually growing fond of each other. But there are, naturally, obstacles to their love. Someone is trying to get rid of Ransom, steal his inheritance. There are secrets in Ransom's past that threatens to overwhelm their trust of one another.And then there are the fanboys and fangirls. Seriously. When your childhood self was written into a bookas a fairy-tale character, this is what you get. A fanclub of your very own.\nThe armored riders dismounted in unison, and the carriage doors opened, spilling forth about a dozen young ladies in medieval dress. Banners waved briskly in the morning breeze.\nHeaven help us!The Setting: A MOTHERFUCKING MEDIEVAL CASTLE, Y'ALL. HOW COOL IS THAT? It is not a pretty castle. It is one of those evil, lurching, looming, scary ones. It comes with scary noises...\nOnce again, she woke to darkness, her heart pounding with terror and her throat scraped raw.Strange noises assailed her from all sides.\nAs well as bats. Lots and lots of bats. Bats that turn a potentially romantic interlude...\n\u201cThere\u2019s a rule about sunsets in this castle, Miss Goodnight.\u201d\u201cThere is?\u201d\u201cYes.\u201d He turned her to face him. \u201cAnd a man and a woman standing in this very place are compelled to heed it. No choice. There\u2019s only one thing to be done.\u201d\u201cWhat\u2019s that?\u201dHer pulse stumbled. Surely he couldn\u2019t mean to...He lowered his head and made his voice a seductive whisper. \u201cDuck.\u201dDuck?\nINTO AN OH MY GOD SWEET MOTHER OF JESUS GOD IN HEAVEN OH FUCK A DUCK SAVE US NOW...moment.\n\u201cOh, no.\u201d She stiffened. \u201cThose can\u2019t be...\u201dThey were.Bats.An entire colony of them had been roosting in the highest reaches of the canopy. Now they took wing one by one, then ten by ten...and then hundreds all at once.\nClearly, the castle, like its master, needs a whooooooole lot of maintenance to get shipshape.Izzy: You know Alice Liddel? Little Alice who inspired Alice in Wonderland? Izzy is like that. She is famous. She has been written into her father's very famous fairy tales, and the whole of England knows about her. But like Alice, nobody wants to read about Izzy Goodnight as a grown up, with her own hopes and dreams. They want to think of Izzy Goodnight as a sweet little girl, forever a child, forever a fantasy.\nThe Lord Archers of the world didn\u2019t want Izzy to be a grown woman with her own set of likes and dislikes, dreams and desires. They wanted her to be the wide-eyed young girl of the stories. That way, they could continue to read and reread their beloved tales, imagining themselves in her place.\nReality is harsher than that. Izzy is not that little girl. She is a strong, determined woman. Izzy is not a faint-hearted girl, but she is not a timid little thing. She may be strong, but she is never, ever a bitch. That is what I love about her.Izzy has so much inner strength. She is scared of a lot of things, she has had a challenging life, with a neglectful father and a nation who wants her to remain a little girl for all of eternity. Izzy used to dream of fantasies, of a love sprung from fairy tales. She is no longer that little girl. Izzy, the woman is all grown up, with a backbone made of steel.\nHe might be wealthy, powerful, angry, and big. But on at least one score, Izzy had him outmatched. Buoyancy. She knew how to handle prickly creatures, and she knew how to make the best of a less-than-ideal situation.When thrown in the pond, she learned how to swim.\nRansom: You rusual dark, brooding duke, but he is just so loveable. He is never a brute. He growls, he snarls, but he never, ever crosses the boundaries. Ransom is all bark, no bite.He wanted to throw her out, the castle is his, after all, but Ransom has a heart, no matter if it has been broken. He cannot throw Izzy out. Ransom is gentler than he lets on.\nBut was this truly all that was left of him? A cruel, unfeeling brute who would cast a defenseless young woman out into the night?He didn\u2019t want to believe that. Not yet. He didn\u2019t surrender anything lightly, and that included what few shards remained of his broken soul.\nRansom, like most Beastly Dukes, have a scarred past. He doesn't allow himself to be loved.\nIt was so foreign to him, this unsolicited tenderness. Incomprehensible. And much as he craved it, it scared him like hell. With every caress he permitted, he was piling up debts he could never repay.You don\u2019t deserve it, came that dark, unforgiving echo. He\u2019d heard the words so many times, they were part of him now. They lived in his blood, resounding with each hollow beat of his heart. You don\u2019t deserve this. You never could.\nBut insidiously, without him realizing it, Izzy, with her wild mane and her good heart and gentle nature, finds her way into his home and his heart. And they're pretty much the same thing.\nIf not for her, this room would still be filled with rats and bats. If not for her, he\u2019d be sitting unshaven and drunk in the great hall, morosely counting his steps to nowhere. And if not for her, he would have no reason to fight this battle at all.\nThe Romance: LOVED IT. This book has plenty of steam, of the sweet, sensual sort. There is no extreme OH LET'S FUCK WITHIN THE FIRST 50 PAGES sort of shit. This is a grown woman who has to slowly understand her own lust.\nShe growled in frustration. \u201cI know I\u2019m not. It makes no sense at all. I\u2019m not a silly little girl who dreams of knights. I\u2019m a woman. A woman who\u2019s inconveniently, completely, and for the first time in her life, in lust. Just burning with desire for the worst possible man. A profane, bitter, wounded duke who refuses to leave her house. Oh, you are dreadful.\u201d\nWho demands that her first kiss be fucking PERFECT, dammit. And if it's not, well, you better make fucking sure you do it right the second time around. And it still counts.\nHer grip tightened on his shirtfront. \u201cYou\u2019re not going to ruin my first kiss. I won\u2019t let you. You\u2019re going to kiss me again, right now. And make it better.\u201dHe shook his head, incredulous. \u201cIt\u2019s over. It\u2019s already done. Even if I did kiss you again, it wouldn\u2019t be your first kiss anymore.\u201d\u201cIt counts,\u201d she said. \u201cSo long as it\u2019s part of the same embrace, it all counts as one.\u201dBloody hell.\nThere's my girl!The romance is so sweet, so genuinely adorable. The writing is absolutely delightful. Nary a page passes when I didn't find myself grinning madly. This book is filled with humor, full of delight.\nSomehow, he\u2019d wound a lock of her hair about his finger. There it was. Right This Moment. And he had no recollection of doing it, either.What was he coming to, when a woman sat in his lap, he gave her a stern what-for...and then ten seconds later, oopsy-daisy and la-di-dah, he went and twirled a finger in her hair?That was not ducal behavior.\nYou will fall in love with this book."}, {"userName": "Jill", "userReviewDate": "Nov 08, 2013", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/3820197-jill", "userReview": "\"Release the ermine!\"Isolde (Izzy) Ophelia Goodnight. Motherless. Fatherless. Homeless. Penniless. Friendless. Plain, twenty-six year-old Izzy, who has never been kissed let alone courted, inherits Gostley Castle. With her pet ermine and little else, she travels to Northumberland to seize inherit the castle.When she arrives she's surprised to find Ransom, Duke of Rothbury (and former owner) still in residence. Seven months ago, thirty year-old Ransom was injured in the face in a duel and has been hiding out in his declining castle ever since.Ms Dare really does have one of the very best voices of humorous historical romances. Here she cleverly weaves in the fairy tale theme with her heroine's father, a writer of fictional tales, the hero (albeit a brooding) knight-in-shining-armour, the plain, penniless but quick-witted and resourceful heroine, and the setting in a castle. There's also a very funny, re-enactment society, fans of Izzy's father's stories.This is your very typical Tessa Dare historical. Well-written, well-plotted, funny. And historically inaccurate. Which doesn't usually bother me. But this time it seemed the characters' attitudes were just a little too modern. Insert two twenty-first century characters into a gown and breeches and you'd have Izzy who was just too keen to (often) jump the Duke's bones and Ransom, who specialised in toe-curling, dirty-talking sex. At least they were well-matched I guess. I debated between 3.5 and 4 stars as I was a bit disappointed in the anachronistic values and mores, especially of the leads. But decided on 4 stars, since it is well-written, funny and entertaining, with two really likable, charming (highly-sexed) protagonists. Not Ms Dare's best in my opinion, but a whole lot better and more enjoyable than most historical romances, and written with a quality of humour almost second to none in romance.

They tend to be angry pricks, and I'm just not turned on by mopey and/or dark dudes.Guess I'm just funny like that...However, humorous historical romances with plucky heroines are my thing, and that's what made Romancing the Duke a big win for me!This story? Well, it's filled to the brim with stuff that I hate.Handsome blind hero and plain/ugly duckling woman.. Hero is physically & emotionally scarred.Hero is calloused and mean.

No, really!Izzy was just so spunky, and funny, and cute. Her life has been less than amazing, but she just never gives up. Ever.Every time Ransom (<--that's the guy) tries to get rid of her (because she's inherited his family's castle), she just ignores his dismissal and pretends he's kidding.Which, naturally, drives him nuts.Of course, he tries to scare her off by threatening to ravish her with kisses. As men do. *snort*But she turns the tables on him by being REALLY open to the suggestion.So, yeah. He's sorta gotta put up or shut up.And then there's this whole storyline about Izzy being the daughter of a famous children's story writer and the (basically) cosplayers who follow her around!

Because it's my life. \u201d\n\u2592 ORIGINAL REVIEW : 4.5 stars \u2592 You know I'm not an historical romance girl. And yet, \nColor me surprised\n : That was all kind of adorable and I fell in love with this story.Sometimes we love characters because they aren't like us - see Penryn for example : did I need to remind you how much I wouldn't survive in the world after? Nope, I don't think so - and other times, we come across some personality traits which remind us so much of ourselves that we can't help but relate to the character. That's what happened to me with some sides of Izzie. Not everything, but enough.- She's spontaneous, that is to say, happens to say everything she has in mind when she's stressed. Yeah, I know the feeling. - She knows what she wants and isn't afraid to ask for it. Personal story time! - you can skip it if you don't care.When I was a kid, sometimes I was grounded (I know, shocking). The fact is, I used to wait a bit (like, half an hour) and after this I always went to my dad to ask him if I could go out. Sometimes he said yes, other times he said no. Whatever. It depended on the stupidity I'd done, I guess. Well, all of that is this to say that I asked what I wanted, contrary to my sister who waited that my parents told her to go out.Why am I telling this to you? To point out that I was a spoiled brat? Hmm... No. Maybe. I don't know. Not the point. Actually I'm telling this because here's what I learnt and remembered : In life, if you want something, you're going to have to ask for it, because people aren't going to guess for you.And that's what annoys me the most in heroines and makes me often want to shake them : that's a rule I apply in my life, and it's pretty simple : if you ask for the opposite of what you want, you'll probably obtain... the opposite of what you want. If you don't know what you want maybe you have to think about it before asking. And finally, if you want something, go for it and ask. Of course that's not because you ask that you will obtain what you want, OF COURSE. But you're increasing your chances here. That's why I loved Izzie.She knows what she wants and she isn't afraid to fight to obtain it. In her straightforward way, she's freaking courageous and her bluntness is incredibly enjoyable. She's a woman, not a spoiled brat. Romanced since her childhood by her writer of a father, she doesn't believe in fairies tales and her only and true goal is to be noticed. To be seen entirely. Even if she's inexperienced as hell, she doesn't shy away and just asks for what she wants. How exhilarating is that?And we have Ransom. Ah, Ransom. What a perfect broody hero you are! Let me tell you : his inner monologues full of venom were hilarious - that's simple, he's always trying to get rid of someone, in one way or another. And wow, how badly he takes people intrusion! That was precious. Like here\n\"How did one get rid of these girls? They were like fanned-away horseflies. They just kept coming back.\"\nOr here\n\"Certainly you can. It's bad enough that they pester you with letters and questions. Draw a line, Goodnight. Go out there and tell them you're a grown woman who can sling about the word 'cock' with the ease of a courtesan, and you don't appreciate unannounced visits. Then invite them to sod off, the bunch of clanking idiots. If you won't, I'll do it.\"\nMoreover he's protective and so. fucking. hot. And above all that, he's a broken man who doesn't believe in love and who's incredibly afraid to open his mind and his heart to feelings - and yet he craves for them. Literally. Damn, that's safe to say that he stole my heart completely : I loved everything : his grumpiness, his struggle to love, his hotness, and he earned his batch of Awwwwwwwww from me. \n\"What was he coming to, when a woman sat in his lap, he gave her a stern what-for... and then ten seconds later, oopsy-daisy and la-di-dah, he went and twirled a finger in her hair?That was not ducal behavior. It certainly wasn't normal behavior for him.\"\nTheir banter was wonderful, full of repartee and yet never filled with disrespect. This brings me to the absolutely delicious conversations between Izzie and Ransom : man, that was hilarious. Between their comments and the awkward situations they're put into (the Army guys. Precious. I'll let you discover it), I couldn't help but laugh out loud like a total fool. That was fucking great. Moreover, the story takes place in a castle (which is awesome) but in a wrecked castle (which is even more awesome). Since his accident, Ransom never had the occasion - and never wanted - to make a home of this castle and guess what? A lot of things will change with Izzie's arrival, much to Ransom's despair!Finally, as a not-so-fond-of-historical-romance girl, what I often despise when I read a book like this is the writing and the pacing. Truth being told, I end bored more often than most and have a hard time enjoying the My Lady and other Your Grace. Good news! Here's I never felt overwhelmed by an heavy writing, that's quite the opposite : I was captivated from the beginning to the end. Bravo! I cheered at the end. I. CHEERED. I don't know what else I can tell you to convince you. Edit : To you specialists of historical,I have a request : If you know others books like this, aka, without too many stereotypical sayings and great characters, please, tell me. I'm like a kid who's discovered ice-cream right now.

It was whimsical, entertaining, and romantic to the core. Definitely not your conventional pair either. Here we have a flawed man and a woman immortalized by her father's stories.Isolde Ophelia Goodnight, made famous through the stories written by her father Sir Henry Goodnight, learned at a young age that fairytales and fiction are nothing close to reality. Left destitute after her father's passing, she sees a light at the end of the tunnel when her godfather leaves her a castle in his will. She might not be homeless after all.<But like everything else in her life, Izzy knows things can be too good to be true. The castle bequeathed to her is in ruins, and a man\u2014a reclusive and grumpy Duke no less\u2014is still in residence and says her godfather had no right to give it to her in the first place. But desperation and fear of destitution fuel Izzy's will to fight.Ransom William Dacre Vane, the eleventh Duke of Rothbury, wants to live the rest of his life in peace inside his crumbling estate, but when a random girl claims to have been gifted Gostley Castle, he knows he can't have that unless she leaves. He tries his best to scare her into fleeing, but Izzy Goodnight is made of sterner stock than he first thought. Besides, there is a bigger issue to resolve\u2014who sold his estate?He agrees to hire her to be his secretary and go through his post. They need to find out if someone is trying to go behind his back and if he's lost more than his estate. He shouldn't be attracted to her, to enjoy her company, but as Izzy tries to bring back life to his once beautiful castle, it's getting harder to resist her.I've only read a few of Tessa Dare's books, but from what I've read, she writes amazing banter and sizzling chemistry between the characters. It was such a delight to read Ransom and Izzy go head to head, and to see them face their respective demons. The story was well-plotted, the pace was great, and the character arcs were wonderful. Even the side characters\u2014Duncan, Miss Pelham, the Moranglians\u2014were endearing and lovable. I only wish the issue with Ransom's solicitors was given more airtime. That aspect of the story felt rushed. Other than that, I enjoyed this book very much.Romancing the Duke is funny, steamy, and enjoyable. If you want to read a romance with a grumpy but incredibly sweet and loyal hero and a strong, resilient, and caring heroine, you'll love Ransom and Izzy.

If it wasn't for her Spindle Cove series, I might have gone the rest of my life thinking that historical romances were not for me. How VERY wrong I was!I listened to this book on audio, and I shelled out big bucks for it, something I rarely do. However, I listened to all of the Spindle Cove books and feel totally in LOVE and so I didn't want to ruin a good trend. The narrator of this book was Carmen Rose, which was a big change from Carolyn Morris, who was a PRO narrating the Spindle Cove books. It took me a little while to appreciate Carmen Rose's narrating style. While she did nice voices and had great range, something about the cadence or reading abilities felt more forced to me. However, the narration grew on me as I listened on and on, and I ended up really enjoying it. I plan on paying more big bucks (*grumbles*) to continue the series in audio. As for the plot... just wonderful. I have a STRONG weakness for a hero with a disability, especially a grouchy hero, and I simply adored Ransom. Ransom and Izzy were a great match, and I loved how their relationship changed and grew over time. But what I love best is how Tessa Dare keeps me on my toes.

He takes her inside and treats her with love, adoration and perfect manners, NOT. Whereupon she finds out she is now the owner of said castle and Cranky is all \"hell no\" and she convinces him to let her stay so she can help him work out his correspondence and obvs problems with his solicitors. Along comes her enterouge of followers not followers, who are really folks totally into re-enacting her \"father's\" stories. See her daddio wrote a series of stories about a Knight, a Lady and adventures. And they all star Isolde in a manner. Anyhoo, here they come in armor and carrying banners and all the stuff. And they basically invade, not invade Duke Cranky Pants' inner sanctum. See, it turns out someone is doing him wrong and they just wanna help him straighten life out.So will CP ever get over himself and find love with Miss Goodnight? Or will he continue through life staring blindly into the sun. Damn, that was one hell of a crappy synopsis. Time for another glass of wine because apparently I have not had enough. Heroine: Izzy. Goodnight. Awesome. With a head of hair that resembles an octopus to a partially blind man. She's tough. As in she's got backbone tough.

Just WOW! This is a spectacular start to another brilliant series. In my eyes, Tessa Dare can do no wrong. I\u2019ve been enchanted by Dare\u2019s unique, captivating writing style for some time now and she has become my go-to author for super sexy and charming historical romances. Isolde \u201cIzzy\u201d Ophelia Goodnight is a twenty-six year old spinster who has never been kissed, thinks she\u2019s an ugly duckling, motherless, fatherless, penniless, homeless, and famous. She\u2019s famous for being the daughter of the author who wrote \u201cThe Goodnight Tales\"--a story of love and romance that has captivated many hearts in England. And the readers believe Izzy is the innocent, doe-eyed girl written in the stories. When her father died, Izzy is left alone with no home and no money, until her godfather bequeathed her Gostley Castle, a bat-infested, crumbling castle that\u2019s barely livable. While excited to have a home of her own, she wasn\u2019t expecting to have the Duke of Rothbury as her castle-mate. Ranson William Dacre Vane, the eleventh Duke of Rothbury, has been injured in a dual. He\u2019s surly, ill-tempered, and scarred. He\u2019s been in hiding from society for seven months in the old decrepit castle along with his valet, Duncan. He doesn\u2019t know how Izzy ended up owning the castle but he is determined to find out. He tries to kick Izzy out upon arrival but she\u2019s just as stubborn as Ransom and refuses to be pushed out. And the more he tries to push her out the more he wants her to stay. So, Ransom ends up hiring her on as his secretary to find out who is behind the selling of his castle. Of course, he didn\u2019t expect to fall for the feisty, interesting woman who has taken over his castle and inserted herself into his heart.I adore the way Tessa Dare wrote Ransom and Izzy\u2019s characters. They are such a hoot together! Izzy is quirky, endearing, and optimistic about life, while Ransom is gruff, grumpy, and damaged. Oh, but he\u2019s not without his charms. Believe me, Ransom charmed my panties off and Izzy\u2019s too as she finds herself utterly drawn to him \u2013 emotional baggage and all. I love how Izzy handles Ransom\u2019s prickly side; seeing right through his fa\u00e7ade. He needed someone to treat him like a man, not a Duke. She gave him the type of love and affection he\u2019s always craved. And while Ransom is no prince charming, never hiding who he is, Izzy, on the other hand, is nothing like England\u2019s innocent sweetheart they\u2019ve depicted her as. No, this little sweetheart hides her true self from the world, which weighs a heavy burden on her, as she lives in two different lives. But she can be herself with Ransom. She loves the way Ransom makes her feel sexy and wanton with his lewd and shameless ways, never treating her like a doe-eyed innocent, instead happily obliging her naughty side. \n\u201cCurse tenderness. To hell with emotion. I\u2019m not the man to fulfill your heart\u2019s desire, but I can give you everything \u2013 everything \u2013 everything you body\u2019s craving.\u201d \u2013 Ransom\nThere are so many delightful things I love about this this story that I found myself swooning and laughing non-stop. These two very charming characters have an exciting and interesting courtship; hot and spicy yet quirky and beautiful at the same time. I love the crazy fans obsessed with \u201cThe Goodnight Tales\u201d and how this romantic tale was infused within the actual storyline. I love how Izzy\u2019s hair is described as wild and alive, like an octopus. I love Izzy\u2019s pet ermine: \u201cRelease the ermine!\u201d And I absolutely love all of the sensual kisses that led to some very passionate tupping. I could go on and on about how much I just love and adored this story but this review would turn into a book. Romancing the Duke is packed with passion, loveable characters, and clever and witty writing. Tessa Dare excels at writing charismatic characters that spring off the pages with big, quirky personalities. Her humor is always off the charts hilarious. And the writing is always so intelligent and so addictive. This book captured my heart and didn\u2019t let go until the last page and then I was looking for more at the very end, hoping for a little sneak peak at what\u2019s to come next. Do yourself a favor and grab this book the moment it\u2019s released. I know historical romance lovers will fall head over heels in love with Ransom and Izzy\u2019s swoon-worthy romance.

I don\u2019t care how many times I read it, there is always something about it that calls to me.Izzy has been immortalized in stories as a child think Fred Savage in The Princess Bride. Her father wrote a selection of stories that have a huge active following the historical fiction equivalent of LARPing and Izzy remains a child to all of them even if she is twenty-six. She grew up on fairy tales and hoped to one day be swept away like those princesses and maidens. But at still she has never been kissed and so all those fanciful dreams have fluttered away. That is until she travels to claim and inheritance from her godfather.Ransom has been licking his wounds for some time now. He is mostly blind and haunts a castle that has been in his family for generations. He wants to quietly brood away, but when Izzy comes to his Castle she changes everything. \n\u201cOf course one kiss changes things. If it's done right, a kiss changes everything.\u201d\nNow Ransom can\u2019t seem to get Izzy out of his castle or his mind. He is trying his best to show her she isn\u2019t safe left alone with him and his rakish ways but she thwarts him at every turn. She reacts differently than any other woman he has met before and maybe just maybe he doesn\u2019t want her out of his life as much as he first thought.\n\u201cIt\u2019s true. Every time you wake up, you let fly the most marvelous string of curses. It\u2019s never the same twice, do you know that? It\u2019s so intriguing. You\u2019re like a rooster that crows blasphemy.\u201d\u201cOh, there\u2019s a cock crowing, all right,\u201d he muttered.\nThe push pull between Izzy and Ransom is fantastic. The more he tries to scare her away the more heated things between them become. I loved the sexual heat and tension between these too. I smiled like a stupid school gill through so many of their interactions and couldn\u2019t wait for them to discover that they were perfect for each other. Each had their own hang ups to overcome, Ransom his blindness and Izzy her confidence but together they made a very strong pair.\n\u201cAstonishing. In the morning, when she sat working at that table of correspondence, silhouetted by sunlight . . . Her hair truly did look like an octopus. It was the way she wore it, he thought. Or maybe the way it wore her. It all sat perched atop her head in that big, inky blob. And no matter how strenuously she pinned it, dark, heavy curls worked loose on all sides, like tentacles. Of course, it was an entrancing, strangely erotic octopus. Ransom worried this might be how fetishes developed.\u201d\nThere were plenty of romantic moments, funny moments and moments that just made me smile. I loved Izzy\u2019s attitude to just make the best out of everything and move along. This was my first Tessa Dare book but I look forward to reading more of her works.Great book for happy stupid fairytale smiles and redeeming of rake by the right woman."}, {"userName": "Nicola", "userReviewDate": "Apr 01, 2018", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/13164153-nicola", "userReview": "4.5 stars.This is only my second Tessa Dare read and proves that my instant love of her writing after the first was for a reason as I loved Romancing the Duke. \nShould I address you as \u2018Your Grace?\u2019\u201d\u201cI don\u2019t see the point of it.

She brings each scene to life with such vivid imagery. This is one of my favourite descriptions:It started to rain. Fat, heavy drops of summer rain\u2014 the kind that always struck her as vaguely lewd and debauched. Little potbellied drunkards, those summer raindrops, chortling on their way to earth and crashing open with glee.\u201cI\u2019m no one\u2019s hero, Miss Goodnight. You\u2019d do well to remember that.\u201dRansom is certainly my kind of hero but then I do have a soft spot for scarred, emotionally wounded heroes. I just knew that under that gruff exterior beats a vulnerable heart and it just needs the right woman to break down his defences. Izzy is just perfect for him with her warmth, passion and gentle heart.I adore Izzy. Tired of being treated like the wide-eyed girl of her father\u2019s stories, she longs to be seen as a grown woman with her own dreams and desires. It is Ransom who is able to see the real Izzy \u2013 a beautiful temptress of a woman, with interesting ideas and sensual wit.I enjoyed the initial sparks and tension between Izzy and Ransome.

No. Is my favorite color yellow? No. Would I object if you were to come inside and remove every stitch of your damp clothing?\u201d His voice did the impossible. It sank lower. \u201cNo.\u201d\nTender moments:\nIzzy didn\u2019t know if these gentle sweeps of her fingertips could erase his pain\u2014 but they were dismantling the safeguards around her heart. She soothed her touch over his brow and scalp, making shushing noises and whispering what she hoped were comforting words.\nSigh-worthy moments:\nIt was oneness, and it was glorious, and it was perfect, and it was her. All her. God, he loved her.\nPoignant moments:\n\u2026since she was there . . . he couldn\u2019t deny that a scarred, neglected part of him craved that softness. Hell, he ached for it, straight to his bones.\nHot sexy moments:\n\u201cOh, I mean to do this everywhere. I plan to have you in every room of this castle. And why stop there?

While it's very funny and lovely, I could not help feeling like it's a parody of the HR genre. Some things were over the top.\nIn the first in Tessa Dare's captivating Castles Ever After series, a mysterious fortress is the setting for an unlikely love . . .As the daughter of a famed author, Isolde Ophelia Goodnight grew up on tales of brave knights and fair maidens. She never doubted romance would be in her future, too. The storybooks offered endless possibilities.And as she grew older, Izzy crossed them off. One by one by one.Ugly duckling turned swan?Abducted by handsome highwayman?Rescued from drudgery by charming prince?No, no, and\u2026 Heh.Now Izzy\u2019s given up yearning for romance. She\u2019ll settle for a roof over her head. What fairy tales are left over for an impoverished twenty-six year-old woman who\u2019s never even been kissed?This one.\nSo, there's Izzy, our desperate 26 years old virgin. She wants a shag so bad that she's shameless when it comes to sexual related things. Don't get me wrong. I hate those heroines who say no and mean yes! just get on with it. But Izzy is a bit too obvious, a bit too desperate. Romancing the Duke is either about laughing or about sex. I cannot believe I'm saying this, but maybe there is such a thing as too much when it comes to frolicking in HR.Then there's Ransom, our most infamous duke. \n\"Oh, you... You...\"\"Cruel bastard? he suggested. \"Heartless rogue? Blackguard? Villain? I've been called all of the above and more. My favorite is 'knave'. Fine word, 'knave'.\"\nHe's visually impaired, so he's quite cranky and annoying. He also didn't get laid in more than seven months, so he's desperate, too. Ransom knows just the right buttons to push when it comes to women. Izzy doesn't stand a chance (not that she wanted to anyway). As a result there's a lot of kissing, petting and, eventually, sex.The ending is the most unbelievable (impossible) thing in the novel. That's one more reason I cannot take it seriously. But it's definitely a fun, relaxing read. So I recommend Romancing the Duke for those days when you're feeling down."}, {"userName": "Jilly", "userReviewDate": "Jan 09, 2017", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/25894509-jilly", "userReview": "A young girl who is made famous by a book by her father.

She has lots of fans, but they want her to be the little girl from the stories, not a grown woman. One older fan dies and leaves her a broken-down old castle because the child in the story lives in one.Cool! A castle, right?Maybe not so much. A couple of problems arise. First, the castle is a piece of crap that is completely a mess and she doesn't have a cent to fix it up. But, secondly, and most importantly, the castle is not abandoned at all. The previous owner still lives there. And, he says he never sold it, so she has to leave. Considering she is penniless and homeless, she isn't going without a fight. This is her crappy castle now, dammit! Bats and all!So, we get a glorious co-habitation between the Duke - a guy who was damaged and blinded in a fight so he locked himself away from the world in a crappy castle; and our heroine - a girl who is famous but hasn't even had any food to eat in days by the time she arrives at Castle Craptastic.They live there together as they try to figure out what happened and see who is the rightful owner of this huge, moth-eaten, bug-ridden, broken-everything, monstrosity. It's like a contest over who gets to eat the meal your dog cooked. You aren't exactly sure what's in there, but you know it won't be pleasant. Our male hero is named Ransom and was a beautiful rake until he was scarred and blinded. Now, he's just an ass.

A good story can either be enhanced by a narrators ability to make the story pleasing to the ear or ruined by the way the narrator portrays the story. Luckily, for me, this one worked and had me listening to it in my spare time. The story was a Beauty and the Beast, sort of, retelling which captured my curiosity. Izzy Goodnight finds herself in a castle with a wounded duke who wants nothing to do with her or the outside world. Prior to ending up in the duke's castle, Izzy had lived with her father until he died and left her penniless. Izzy was the daughter of a well-loved author whose fairy tales were published throughout the countryside. Unfortunately, at the time of his death, his will had been that the next closest male relative would inherit Mr. Goodnight's fortune. There was a slight twist towards the end of the book that added to the fun of the story.

Both of them were excellent in their own way!Izzy, with her disillusions, with her very derogatory view of herself. But with her wit and her smarness she's very able to face everything life throws at her.\n\u201cWhy must this be so mortifying? Oh, that's right. Because its my life.\u201d \nShe know what she wants: her castle and she's not afraid to go against a very angry duke. She challenges him at every turn, until he's forced to concede. It was so wonderful to read!Ransom is angry at life. At himslef, at his blindness. He wants to be left alone to brood. So when a little tenacious woman appears in his riuned castle he's furious. He tries to throw her out, but she won't have it. He's grumpy, he's offensive, he's rude. \n\u201cHe let his eyes flitter over her. \u201cI don\u2019t see anything \u2018precisely.\u2019 I can tell you\u2019re slender. I can see you\u2019re wearing white, or some light color. Your face is pale, your lips are reddish. And there appears to be a dark brown octopus attacking your head.\u201d\u201cThat\u2019s my hair.\u201dRansom shrugged. \u201cYou asked what I see. I see tentacles.\u201d \nHe's ready to resort to violence but something is keeping him back...\nHer hair truly did look like an octopus. It was the way she wore it, he thought. Or maybe the way it wore her. It all sat perched atop her head in that big, inky blob. And no matter how strenuously she pinned it, dark, heavy curls worked loose on all sides, like tentacles. Of course, it was an entrancing, strangely erotic octopus. Ransom worried this might be how fetishes developed.\u201d \nTheir attraction grows day bay day and Ransom's grumpiness slowly disappear.\n\"I don't know what to make of you this morning. Where's the surly man who greets the dawn with a curse? What about 'Good grief, Goodnight?' Where are those carming maritime endearments?\"He pulled on a lock of her hair. \"Octopus.\"\"Well, that's all wrong. You said it so fondly.\"\nThere were a lot of funny moments: the ermine, Snowdrop, the Moranglians, the vicar's daugther, the vallet...The romance is sweet and lovely and their moments together were hot, but I would have liked the book even if they were absent.It is not as good as her Spinder Cove series, but it is still worth 5 stars for me! :)"}, {"userName": "Dina", "userReviewDate": "Nov 08, 2013", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/1918270-dina", "userReview": "Trust Ms. Dare to gift me with my first 5-star read of the year.

Now you\u2019re making me tea. And flicking fluff. Is this some kind of coddling? I don\u2019t want any coddling.\u201d \u201cIt\u2019s not coddling. It\u2019s not meant to be tormenting, either. I just\u2026enjoy greeting you in the morning.\u201d \u201cThat\u2019s impossible.\u201d Ransom would have believed just about any other excuse. But she couldn\u2019t expect him to credit that she stole down here in the misty, early dawn for the pleasure of his company. \u201cIt\u2019s true. Every time you wake up, you let fly the most marvelous string of curses. It\u2019s never the same twice, do you know that? It\u2019s so intriguing. You\u2019re like a rooster that crows blasphemy.\u201d \u201cOh, there\u2019s a cock crowing, all right,\u201d he muttered. Izzy has nothing. After her story writing father passed away, he never updated his will include her, so everything, every single thing is left to Izzy\u2019s horrible cousin, a man who took much glee in torturing a young Izzy growing up. So much so that she still has an intense fear of the dark, one of the many tortures she had to endure. She receives sudden word that she\u2019s inherited a castle, but much to her dismay the castle is possibly haunted, has been looted, is in horrible condition and comes with its past owner still in residence, Ransom the Duke of Rothbury.Ransom has been somewhat of a recluse of late. He was injured badly in sword fight and has been recovering in his home with only his manservant, Duncan, as company. His injuries impacted his sight, which is all but gone, he\u2019s withdrawn from society and seems to be content wandering the dark castle halls for the rest of his life, withering away. Now Izzy has blown into his life, a woman with nothing to lose and she refuses to leave the castle that she believes to be hers. But Ransom won\u2019t leave as he claims that he never authorized the castle be sold in the first place and until they figure it all out, they\u2019re stuck. Ransom takes some pity on Izzy and reluctantly offers her a position as his secretary. He needs someone to read his correspondence, the mountains of it, where in lies no doubt, the truth about what\u2019s happened to the castle and he\u2019ll pay her enough daily so that she\u2019ll be able to move on once it\u2019s proven that he\u2019s still the owner. Izzy agrees because she plans to use the money to help restore the castle one it\u2019s proven that she\u2019s the owner. What they end up uncovering is that someone far greedier may be taking advantage of Ransom.I loved this story. I loved everything about it, starting with the set-up of these two lonely misfits finding each other. Random with his blindness and Izzy with her self-proclaimed plainness, two people with nothing to lose who refuse to give in and forge an unlikely friendship that leads to much more. Izzy lived her childhood in fairytales and dreams, and she\u2019s famous for being the little girl who stars in her father\u2019s stories that are well loved by the public. But no one actually sees her as the woman she\u2019s become, she\u2019s always \u201clittle Izzy Goodnight\u201d to them, but even without sight, Ransom is the first person, the first man, to really see her. And with a few bumps along the way and some situations that weren\u2019t handled as well as Ransom could have, he vows to find a way to keep her in his life.For Ransom, his mother died giving birth to him and his horrible father never let him forget that. He grew up without feeling loved, without being hugged or touched and now he\u2019s almost starved for affection. He pushes Izzy away at first, that\u2019s what he\u2019s always done, never hoping or believing that anyone, especially now with his disability, would ever stick around long enough to love him, but Izzy is unlike anyone he\u2019s ever met. They get each other, I know that sounds clich\u00e9d but on page they have so much chemistry, their dialogue snaps and they ended up being exactly what the other person had no idea they needed.\u201cDon\u2019t stop.\u201d He sucked in his breath as a fresh wave of pain nearly knocked him cold. \u201cDon\u2019t stop.\u201d \u201cI won\u2019t stop,\u201d she promised. Izzy\u2019s heart twisted. There was something so moving about seeing a man so big, so powerful, curled up like a puppy on the floor, damp with perspiration and writhing in evident pain. His arms laced tight about her waist. She\u2019d been alone for a long time. In some ways, since well before her father died. And she was well enough acquainted with loneliness to understand that the worst part wasn\u2019t having nobody caring for you \u2013 it was having nobody to care for.There are a few other fun revelations that come up as the story goes along, supporting characters who are colorful, fun and add just enough to the overall story to make everything flow together so well. The romance is sweet and tender, seeing both of these people finally find someone to love and watching Ransom come to life all because of Izzy\u2019s influence. I loved everything about this story, as if you hadn\u2019t already caught on to that fact!Tessa Dare brings the humor and heart that I\u2019ve come to expect in her stories but it hit a little deeper with Romancing the Duke. There\u2019s some very vulnerable about both Izzy and Ransom and it was so incredibly satisfying to see these two strong characters let themselves be vulnerable to each other and find love when they never thought it possible. I loved this book and it\u2019s one I\u2019d highly recommend to all romance readers."}], "description": "In the first in Tessa Dare's captivating Castles Ever After series, a mysterious fortress is the setting for an unlikely love . . .As the daughter of a famed author, Isolde Ophelia Goodnight grew up on tales of brave knights and fair maidens.
