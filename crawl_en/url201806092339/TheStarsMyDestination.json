It is rich in incident, ambitious in conception, terse and unemotional in style, and fiercely Romantic in theme. Although it is a revenge tale based on The Count of Monte Cristo, its heart is perhaps closer to Frankenstein, but to a Frankenstein in which the monster is capable of self-redemption, of moving beyond isolation and bitterness toward an enlightened humanity. And all the things that are good about this novel are embodied in its hero\u2014Caliban and Hamlet, Satan and Samson, Cain and Prometheus combined\u2014the brute-genius Gully Foyle.During a war between the Inner and the Outer Planets, Gully Foyle\u2014unlettered, unskilled, amoral\u2014is adrift upon the wreck of the space ship The Nomad, the sole survivor of an attack. When the friendly ship Vorga knowingly passes him by, he becomes consumed by the desire for revenge. It is this passion which motivates him throughout a series of crimes\u2014including (but not limited to) blackmail, rape, and murder--as he transforms himself into the elegant Geoffrey Fourmyle, still searching for the person who years ago decided to leave poor Gully Foyle for dead.Foyle's search takes place in a future world dense with marvels and horrors: wide use of individually initiated teleportation (\u201cjaunting\u201d), heartless mega-corporations, occasional telepathy, vast underground prisons, a cargo cult with cool tattoos, a cathedral housing a circus, a mysterious substance (\"PyrE\") which may either consume or transform our world, and the fragmentation of time.This is a very entertaining novel, but also a thoughtful one. Its ending is ambitious and outrageous, exalting The Hero, Democracy and Freedom, and yet acknowledging the ignorance, darkness and oppression from which these gifts inevitably spring. I can give it no better praise than to say I think Shakespeare, Milton, Byron, and Mr. and Mrs. Shelley--and, yes, Dumas pere too--would have liked it a lot."}, {"userName": "Terry ", "userReviewDate": "Oct 17, 2011", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/1262683-terry", "userReview": "Gully Foyle is my nameTerra is my nationDeep space is my dwelling placeThe stars my destinationSci-fi from its formative days is funny. Not funny ha-ha (not always anyway), but funny-weird\u2026at least for me. I am often unable to get over the clunky writing and wispy plots despite the many cool ideas on display. Sometimes even a premise as cool as a galaxy-spanning empire held together by the prods and pokes of a few cognoscenti using an arcane sociological science still can\u2019t make a plodding plot with artless prose and paper-thin characters readable to me (sorry, Mr. Asimov). At other times the founders of the genre can suffer by comparison to their descendants who have taken the ideas that, while new and fresh when they used them, seem old and tired when you come to the foundational works after seeing them presented elsewhere, often with more compelling characters and well-crafted prose. Then there are books like this one, written by Alfred Bester, and you understand why some classics are still classics.Gully Foyle is a gutter-boy. A low, brainless brute barely able to act as a Mechanic\u2019s Mate 3rd class on the spaceship \u2018Nomad\u2019, oiling and wiping the machines and acknowledged by his superiors to be a human dead end. Then the passing ship \u2018Vorga\u2019 left him to rot, the only survivor on a crippled ship in the void. So, in five seconds, he was born, he lived, and he died. After thirty years of existence and six months of torture, Gully Foyle, the sterotype Common Man, was no more. The  key turned in the lock of his soul and the door was opened.A purpose had been found that could open up all of the potential this beast-man had within him: vengeance. From here we follow Foyle as he lifts himself out of the pit (physically at least) by his bootstraps and ingeniously contrives both his own rescue and the plans that set him on the path that will allow him to fulfill his oath: \u201cI find you, \u2018Vorga\u2019. I find you, I kill you, \u2018Vorga\u2019. I kill you filthy.\u201d All the while his spirit stews in the morass from which his body could escape and he becomes a rapist, thug and purveyor of violence in pursuit of his goal. No price is too high to reach it, whether it be imprisonment or social isolation; no obstacle can stand in his way, whether it be the most powerful institutions in the world, or the human dignity of those he uses. Beware, Gully Foyle is on his way.Bester\u2019s prose is well-wrought and carries us briskly along with Foyle on his quest, from the gutter tongue of the 25th century into which he was born to the more refined prose of the high society parties which Foyle must infiltrate. Bester also does a fine job of describing his world and his ability to portray everything from the rigours of Gully\u2019s six month survival in a broken hulk in deep space a gruelling moment at a time, to the weird and wonderful portrayal of Foyle\u2019s trauma-induced synaesthesia later in the book is astonishing. I was dazzled. There are also more ideas packed into one slim volume than you can shake a stick at and all of them are foundational in the genre: cybernetic implants for physical and mental enhancement, personal teleportation (with many of the social ramifications of its existence worked out in the story), world-ending manufactured compounds that leave the future of humanity lying on a knife\u2019s edge, a world controlled by pseudo-feudal multinational corporations, a forgotten society of future primitives living on a lonely asteroid, tattooing their faces with hideous designs, and worshipping a debased form of the scientific method\u2026and the list goes on. Why were they able, at their best, to do this kind of thing in the old days in one slim volume, while today a writer would have taken half of these ideas, or even one, and written a two thousand page multi-volume epic out of it? Add to that the cast of characters that are almost all equally memorable and well-drawn: the megalomaniac Presteign of Presteign, a man of wealth and power cognisant of little save his own desires and dignity; his equally powerful daughter, the beautiful blind albino Olivia, an ice-princess who sees the world in the infra-red and electro-magnetic spectrums and carries her own dark secrets; the memorably named Jisbella McQueen (Jiz to her friends, thanks very much) a criminal miscreant both attracted to and repulsed by Foyle; and the man with the death\u2019s head smile, Saul Dagenham, a scientist made \u2018hot\u2019 by an accident that has left him a radioactive outcast, able to interact with others in only a limited way.I must admit that, while I thoroughly enjoyed this book from the start, I was minded to give it a three star rating until I came to the climax and Bester managed to turn a scarred, brutal criminal into an altruistic saviour for a mankind as lost and directionless as he had been. One key had turned and made Gully Foyle into a remorseless machine for vengeance, another equally harsh set of trials then took this driven creature and made him into someone able to see the root of humanity\u2019s need and try his best to give them the key to their own awakening. I challenge you, me. Die or live and be great. Blow yourselves to Christ gone or come and find me,  Gully Foyle, and I make you men. I make you great. I give you the stars.What a great read. Highly recommended.(Bester also gets extra points for having written the silver age Green Lantern oath, a ditty almost as cool as the one quoted above about Gully Foyle.)Also posted at Shelf Inflicted"}, {"userName": "Catie", "userReviewDate": "Apr 18, 2011", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/1886642-catie", "userReview": "I think that this book pretty much just blew my mind. I mean, am I crazy, or is this one of the most profound things ever written?\"You pigs, you. You goof like pigs, is all. You got the most in you and you use the least. You hear me, you? Got a million in you and spend pennies. Got a genius in you and think crazies. Got a heart in you and feel empties. All a you. Every you\u2026.\u201dAlright, you probably have to read the book to appreciate that, and you should! Can I entice you further by saying that an android delivers the meaning of life in a radiation fueled moment of lucidity, before collapsing, about five pages before that speech? How about the fact that this book contains an evil millionaire, an albino with abnormal perception, a gorgeous telepath, a radioactive courier, a slick super spy, a cold-hearted, red-headed jailbird, and a bionic psychopath bent on revenge? Okay, I am pulling out my very last card. Wait for it\u2026The Count of Monte Cristo\u2026in space. That\u2019s right! Except in this version, he finds enlightenment and awakens humanity in the end. I could see the comparison between these two masterpieces right away, but at first everything seemed to be happening much too fast. How could he cram the years and years of slowly simmering vengeance of Edmund Dantes into a paltry two hundred pages? But then I started thinking. This is the future: where teleportation makes travel instantaneous; where the body and mind can be upgraded with hypno-learning and a little re-wiring; where information can be gained with the latest psychological coercion techniques. In short, this is a world where patience is no longer required for revenge. Like Dantes, Gully is a simple man awakened to all of his great potential by a fiery need for vengeance. But Gully is ten times more impulsive and rash than Dantes ever was; he kills indiscriminately and without conscience. And when he begins to awaken, he wakes up completely.This book contains one of the most colorful, interesting casts of characters that I have ever come across. I can definitely see that Alfred Bester had a history in comics; many of these characters seem like comic book heroes in the making. I can also see that this was written in the 1950\u2019s. It\u2019s nice that he could envision women fighting against their oppression, but I am a little sad that he saw the double standard placed on women continuing for hundreds of years. Also, I can almost see him delighting in his own progressiveness when he repeatedly describes Robin Wednesbury as a gorgeous \u201cnegro girl,\u201d more times than he describes the race of anyone else in the book (stick it in your eye, racist pigs!). But it comes across as a bit glaring to someone raised in the Sesame Street, avoid mentioning race at all costs generation. Some of the technological advances that he envisioned are quite a hoot as well. For example, he imagined that teleportation would end the need for communications systems:\u201dIn an age when communication systems were virtually extinct \u2013 when it was far easier to jaunte directly to a man\u2019s office for a discussion than to telephone or telegraph \u2013 \u201cI think that he severely underestimated the lengths that people will go to to avoid speaking face to face.Perfect Musical PairingTool \u2013 LateralusI\u2019ve seen these guys twice in concert, and I love them for their sweeping, dynamic, ten minute long songs. They put on quite a show \u2013 with crazy mind-bending imagery and clothes (or lack thereof). Their shows always make me feel like I would probably be getting more out of them if I were on mind altering drugs of some sort, which isn\u2019t really a good thing for me (huge fan of reality and lifelong abstainer). The ending of this book makes me feel almost the same way \u2013 it\u2019s just a little bit too \u201cout there\u201d for me to fully appreciate, but I still found it incredibly moving. This song is all about transcending our basic, human selves."}, {"userName": "Lyn", "userReviewDate": "May 07, 2015", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/5253785-lyn", "userReview": "\u201cGully Foyle, that\u2019s my name, me.\u201dAlfred Bester has created in Gulliver Foyle one of Science Fiction\u2019s great characters.

It ought to be required reading for anyone setting out to know the history of the field and what sparked the imagination of so many other writers.

Read it, is all.This book has been quite the ride. Gully Foyle is your guide in a future where teleportation (\"jaunting\") is the main mode of transportation and where interplanetary tensions seem to mount up to an unavoidable Solar System War. Gully Foyle is a guide you might not like very much, but boy, will he take you places. You'll feast your eyes on locations such as Nightmare Theatre, Freak Factory, sub-terranean prisons, a Sedative Garden and an asteroid consisting of salvaged wreckage, inhabited by savage scientists. On top of that you'll be taking short trips to the Moon, Mars and beyond. You'll meet colourful (and some extravagantly colourless) characters on the way, death-head Dagenham being one of my personal favorites. Better be quick though because Foyle isn't waiting up. He moves fast and in straight lines, through walls, through people, through morals, through conventions, through dimensional limits, through action-packed chapters that will make your head spin. Why might you not like Gully Foyle, you ask? He's a cockroach. An angry one at that, with a simple mind set on revenge. Anything that stands in his way, anyone who tries to trample him, is in for a surprise. He survives against all odds. And you know what stuff that doesn't kill you really does? Right. Your guide will evolve, his instinct for survival will always be that split second quicker than whatever wants to end him.And as your guide grows stronger you might, despite a very shaky start, grow to like him. Don't be surprised if you would see an ugly, tattooed face next to the encyclopedia entry of \"character development\". It's Gully Foyle, the developing character extraordinaire. He might start off as a man too easy for trouble, too slow for fun, too empty for friendship, too lazy for love, a shell of a man throwing the angry question into the void: \"What's a matter, me? Help, you goddamn gods! Help, is all.\", but as this cockroach grows stronger, he also grows wiser. The cockroach will meet himself. A confrontation that, if handled succesfully, will take him to the stars."}, {"userName": "Carol.

Uses both his perspective and that of the anonymous supporter to chilling effect. Guest appearance by Ivanka near the end.***********************************Forgive me my little joke; when I picked up the classic by Bester, I had no idea what I was in for, except a classic sci-fi--in space, with a rather appealing title.The main character is Gully Foyle, a spacer with no real motivation in life. Content to be lazy, without purpose beyond existence, he's a bit of a drifter, until a spaceship he is traveling on is destroyed. Gully discovers a will to live and manages to keep himself barely alive, leaving the tiny reinforced space he exists in to scavenge supplies five minutes at a time in his barely functional spacesuit. At last, he sees a ship passing close by. He sends up a signal flare. The ship slows, almost stops, and then turns away. From here, the story takes off, as Gully discovers the heat of revenge as the one thing that can give him purpose.One might think that discovering a passion could connect Gully to humanity, and possibly even the reader, a previously amorphous blob of a human who was content to vegetate his way through life. But no, most certainly, absolutely no, because Gully is a psychopath. In his quest for revenge, he meets a woman, Robin, who teaches the previously head-blind the skill of jaunting or limited teleportation. She has the unfortunate distinction of being a one-way telepath, so those around her can hear her thoughts when she isn't concentrating. Gully, it becomes clear, has a moment where he can understand what she is feeling/thinking, but doesn't actually empathize, instead choosing to ignore her humanity in his fit of rage and frustration. Throughout the rather short book, Gully goes through transformations, each a step on his goal, each transformation followed by a fall back into the depths. He is caught, he spends time in prison, he meets another woman and--dare we recognize it?--falls into his version of love. But as is everything with Gully, his love is the negative side of the emotion, and though it can offer salvation, it is obvious what his choice will be.It is an inverse of the levels of hell; each reinvention has Gully reinventing himself to become more surfacely human, moving up the ladder of society into something that appears more socially acceptable but that remains rotten at the core. Depending on the reader's point of view, he may become more accessible, but really he is the same single-minded psychopath, single-minded in pursuit of his goal and unable to recognize or empathize with others. At one point he thinks he 'falls in love' but as with everything, he's fallen in love with an idea, an instant of emotion and not anything real.It's a brilliant book. Bester does an unbelievable job at getting at Gully's emotion; I found myself taking a break at each transformation, needing to get a way from the miasma of hate for some untainted air. While Gully transforms, we're offered commentary on each section of 'society' he encounters, from the parody of scientists on an asteroid to the 'high' society of the richest men in the universe and their cloistered women. It's one of those amazing little stories that you understand as you read is offering up a scathing social indictment and yet wraps you up in its fast-paced plotting. I can't remember the last book I read with a main character so filled with hate and rage, that ignores every opportunity for redemptive actions.The ending was a little slap-dash and has me wondering if dropping acid at least once during a book was a basic requirement of some of the sci-fi boundary pushers (thinking of Zelazny and Philip K. Dick here). Well, no matter, but I think it would have been more powerful had Bester relied on words instead of word-pictures. The circular nature of the ending is asthetically pleasing, although someone pushing the rules of the book. No matter, it was powerful nonetheless.We can all only hope that Trump will experience something similar."}, {"userName": "RandomAnthony", "userReviewDate": "Apr 06, 2013", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/721021-randomanthony", "userReview": "Holy shit, The Stars My Destination is a revelation. How'd this novel get past me for so long? I picture Alfred Bester as a mad scientist, surrounded by paper and typewriters, a cigarette dangling from his mouth, knocking this fucker out in the mid-50s. Bester writes likes he has to get all of his ideas out of his head RIGHT NOW, like they're going to explode if they stay in his brain too long. People who buy special diseases so they can go into the hospital and hang out with cute nurses? Neurological modification so, when a person tries to tell a particular truth, the brain short circuit and dies? He throws out concepts by the paragraph that less brave writers would save as other novels' cores. The storyline shifts and flows while the main character engages in despicable behavior in the search for the person who ordered a ship to leave him stranded on a fuel-less ship sipping through space. Through the text a thread of dread, hope, faith, and impulse pushes toward a stay-up-late-to-finish ending. I need to read this sucker again and savor the structure. William Gibson apparently called The Stars My Destination \"perfectly surefooted, elegantly pulpy,\" and \"dizzying in its pace and sweep.\" I don't think higher praise could be afforded this book.

There are certain books which impressed me, which resist all my attempts to condense them into a few short paragraphs. However, if I don't write something now, this book will join my \"forever unreviewed books\" list, so I am putting up a somewhat inchoate review.This book contains one of the most unpleasant protagonists I have ever encountered. Gully Foyle is totally without ambition, content only to survive. That survival is threatened, however, when he is trapped inside a spaceship damaged in the war between the Inner Planets (IP - Earth, Mars, Moon etc.) and the Outer Satellites (OS - the moons of Jupiter and Saturn): but Gully survives for 170 days, when he sees a ship approaching. His delight is turned to chagrin, and then an insane desire for revenge as the ship Vorga leaves without picking him up. What remains is the story of that revenge and how it changes Gully and the world.Bester has created a rich and complex future in the twenty-fifth century: mankind has spread across the solar system, there is a full-fledged war due to commercial tensions between the settled worlds, people no longer travel but rather \"Jaunte\" - that is, transport themselves at the speed of thought... in a way, it is information overload, and the author does the unspeakable thing of explaining it in detail to the reader in the prologue! (Blasphemy! Show, don't tell!) But he gets away with it by ensnaring us in the intricate tapestry, and immediately diving into the middle of the story.Gully Foyle is a number one blackguard. He is uncouth, sexist, totally amoral and illiterate into the bargain. He uses people ruthlessly - in the beginning, he blackmails and rapes a Jaunte instructor, whom he later kidnaps to help him in his nefarious schemes. Similarly, he jettisons into space another young woman who has helped him escape from an underground asylum, so that he can save his skin. Yet we keep on following him due to two reasons - the story is so powerful, and there is absolutely no attempt from the author's side to justify his character.Towards the end the novel takes a huge conceptual leap, as perspective shifts over time and space. to create the jagged effect, Bester has used the printed word in very innovative ways - the letters are boxed in, stretched out, strung together to create wave patterns and pictograms... it's the nearest you can come to jump cuts in literature. The narrative becomes almost visual here, and it is this part of the novel which pushed it up from three to four stars for me.A real classic from the golden age."}, {"userName": "Apatt", "userReviewDate": "Aug 29, 2011", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/2457095-apatt", "userReview": "I first read this book decades ago under the title of Tiger! Tiger! (British edition). I just reread it recently for the purposes of writing this review. Fortunately I have memory like a sieve so I enjoy this reread just as much as the first time.The Stars My Destination is one of the few sf books that is included in almost every all-time best sf books I have ever seen, and I have seen many. If I see such a list without this book I will probably dismiss it.The story is centered upon Gully (Gulliver) Foyle a vengeful anti-hero protagonist who thinks nothing of whacking all and sundry with a sledgehammer. It is set in a universe where practically everybody can teleport, the part where teleportation (\"jaunting\") is discovered by accident and developed into a normal mode of transportation is brief yet brilliant, and the social and cultural ramifications are very well thought out. Foyle is not exactly likable but you have to feel sorry for the ordeals he goes through in this book. Abandoned, marooned, kidnapped, tortured, and imprisoned, no wonder he is so bitter and vengeful all the time; at no point does anybody offer him a nice cup of tea or a manicure. Foyle stoically goes through all this ill treatment with a snarl and a promise of payback. Bester's witty and intelligent prose contrast nicely with the gutter language spoken by Foyle in the first half of the book. The author has cited The Count of Monte Cristo as an influence for this book but the similarity is not noticeable until Foyle reinvented himself with an extreme makeover in the second half of the book, the breakneck pace of the book also slows down for the elaborate revenge plan at this point.As this is one of the most beloved sf books ever recommendation is not usually necessary for regular sf readers, readers new to the genre will find this an ideal starting point. The last couple of chapters are wonderfully trippy, surreal, philosophical and cosmic! I suspect these last chapters play a large part in pushing the book to its classic status.I love this book, me!"}, {"userName": "Algernon", "userReviewDate": "Aug 27, 2013", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/4728718-algernon", "userReview": "[ it's a bomb, thousands of time more powerful than an atomic bomb.

One is that it really reads modern for a book written in 1956. The other is that it has some really antiquated ideas about the future.First for the positive. For the first 200 of the 250 or so pages of the story, I couldn't stand the protagonist, Gulliver Foyle. However, he grows as a human being to the point that I ended up spending the last 50 pages cheering him on. Bester did an excellent job of taking Foyle from being almost an animal to a self-educated man with no conscience to a man who cares deeply about mankind and its future. The story is tightly written and the pacing is practically perfect. I had a hard time putting it down even while I was really hating Gully. I can see that this book has had a huge impact on modern science fiction writers. It is nothing like the typical science fiction novels of the mid-Fifties.Now, for the negative. The things that really bothered me had mostly to do with the sensibilities of the Fifties expressed in the book. Women were protected and kept morally pure. They were more like possessions than anything else. You'd think that 500 years in the future, women would be a bit more equal to men. Also, while I really loved the character of Robin Wednesbury, I hated how Bester felt it necessary to say something about her being a Negro every time he talked about her. It's clear that he thought it would be really cool to have an intelligent, capable Negro \"girl\" character and he acts like it's really remarkable. I think she's a wonderful character and well-written other than the constant references to her race which I found distracting and dated. In contrast, he only mentions Olivia Presteign's albinism a couple of times, not every time she appears.

The Stars My Destination is one such book, a thrill ride from beginning to end that despite being published in 1955 still hits hard and holds its own in 2017. Several times while reading The Stars My Destination a very clear thought occurred to me- this shouldn't be working. The narrative is flush with odd plot developments, amusing 1950s sci-fi anachronisms (Newspapers being printed in the far future when they're struggling for readers in 2017) non-sequitur story twists (to my mind) and a foundation premise - scientists discover everyone innately has the power to teleport themselves - that is pretty thin. Yet despite all this I really dug Bester's novel, and I raced through it. From the first few pages, where Bester's main character Gully Foyle is trapped for months in a psyche-warpingly small closet (the only sealed compartment left in his crippled ship) and eventually plans his rather gripping escape I was hooked. Foyle goes from zero-to-homicidally-driven-anti-hero over the course of a chapter and what happens to him in the wreckage of his vessel sets him off on a novel-length quest for revenge against the people who abandoned him.The book runs at a sweat-inducing pace, dashing from development to development and only rarely stopping to catch its breath. Things happen. They happen fast and they happen big, and as the story progresses Foyle's transformation from listless bottom-of-the-heap loser to implacable, resourceful hunter and beyond is very satisfying. Some golden age SF can't transcend the period in which it was written, and is mired in concepts that are now outdated, or modes of storytelling that present day readers can find dull (see some of Asimov's short stories for prime examples of this type.) The Stars My Destination in contrast, is still fresh. Its flaws are minor and its storytelling is both straightforward and engaging.In short, it's well worth your time. I rate the pulse-quickening opening sequence in the crippled ship as being right up there with the best parts of The Martian and I rank this novel as one of the classics of its era."}, {"userName": "Megan Baxter", "userReviewDate": "Jul 31, 2011", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/5742086-megan-baxter", "userReview": "Gully Foyle is not a likeable man.

Add a truly satisfying conclusion and explanation of the economic impact of teleportation makes this book truly classic."}, {"userName": "Stuart", "userReviewDate": "Apr 04, 2013", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/9456990-stuart", "userReview": "The Stars My Destination: Tiger, Tiger, Burning Bright, Intent on Revenge(Posted at Fantasy Literature)Much has been written about Alfred Bester\u2019s classic 1956 SF novel The Stars My Destination (Tiger! Tiger! in the UK edition). According to Wikipedia, it is considered one of the best SF books of all time by many authors such as Neil Gaiman, Joe Haldeman, Samuel. R. Delany, Robert Silverberg, and William Gibson. Predating cyberpunk by almost three decades (if you count from Neuromancer in 1984), it features a fully-realized world of ruthless multinational corporations, cybernetic enhancements, and most importantly, the concept of \u201cjaunting\u201d, the ability to teleport instantly between two places if the jaunter knows the exact locations and has seen them before physically. This ability is available to almost everyone in society. As you might expect, this created dramatic upheaval in global society and has completely transformed economies, transportation, and social behavior. For instance, due to the ability of people to jaunt into any known location, wealthy families create impenetrable labyrinths to protect themselves and women are confined to such places in many cases, giving rise to a Neo-Victorian society. The story begins in very cinematic fashion with a lone crewman named Gully Foyle, who wakes up to find himself the sole survivor of an attack on a merchant spaceship called Nomad. He initially finds ways to survive but is not pushed into action until a passing ship, the Vorga, ignores the distress signals he has been sending out. This fuels an intense rage in him that will consume and transform him utterly into a single-minded beast driven by the desire for revenge on whomever controlled the Vorga. As it turns out, the Vorga is owned by the same ultra-wealthy and decadent Presteign clan that owns the Nomad, and the further Gully pursues each link in the mystery behind the Vorga\u2019s actions, the more convoluted the plot becomes, and he encounters a plethora of very unusual and intriguing characters. Along the way, he himself changes in dramatic ways and we also get a very detailed tour of this future world where teleportation dominates. There are even some telepaths (echoes of Bester\u2019s previous novel The Demolished Man, which won the inaugural Hugo Award) in the story, a mysterious super-powerful substance called PyrE, a \u201cjaunt-proof\u201d high security prison, a primitive space-bound cargo cult, various assassins and secret societies, and a struggle between the Inner Planets and Outer Colonies, which is a theme that has been explored in the genre many times since, including most recently James S.A. Corey\u2019s THE EXPANSE series. Perhaps the biggest question for modern readers is, does this classic still hold up today, almost 60 years after initial publication? The answer is ABSOLUTELY! This book is fierce, cynical, lighting-paced, complex, philosophical, darkly humorous, and frankly doesn\u2019t feel dated at all. It\u2019s more exciting as cyberpunk than William Gibson, not as self-congratulatory as Iain M. Banks\u2019 Culture novels, and takes a far more skeptical of the future than Robert Heinlein\u2019s SF novels. Stylistically, it runs circles around the pedestrian prose of contemporaries like Arthur C. Clarke (who I like) or Isaac Asimov (who I don\u2019t). Considering how much impact Bester has had on the genre with only two major books, The Demolished Man and The Stars My Destination, I think every serious SF fan owes it to themself to give this book a try."}, {"userName": "Lindsay", "userReviewDate": "Jun 10, 2017", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/10326608-lindsay", "userReview": "A pioneering work of science fiction that captures the dreams and fears of its time while maintaining an entertaining and madcap story.Gully Foyle is marooned in space in the wreckage of a spaceship. After six months of barely surviving another spaceship approaches, clearly sees him and then leaves him to die. Gully is a low-class uninspired person, but this event catalyzes his monumental will to live and focuses it into a psychopathic lust for revenge where mere survival takes a distant secondary role. Through a series of adventures Gully reinvents himself through education and accomplishment, always drawing closer to the revenge he seeks and almost always defeated by his own psychopathic compulsions.There are elements of the 1950s all through this work, from the simmering cold war between the Inner Planets and the Outer Satellites, to the imminent apocalyptic destructive potential of the PyrE substance that much of the plot revolves around, to the rise of corporate conformity culture that we see with the Mr Prestos of the Presteign company. There's also a sign of the Campbellian SF times with a large part of the plot concerning mental powers of teleportation (Jaunting) and telepathy.It's also very clear how influential this book was on later works. The sheer insanity of the Fourmyle Circus seems to me a clear antecedent of Zelazny's Lord of Light and other writers of the New Wave."}, {"userName": "Jim", "userReviewDate": "Aug 21, 2016", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/695116-jim", "userReview": "4 stars is a bit of stretch for a space opera with plot holes I could pilot a ship through, but I allowed for when it was written, the ideas contained, & the narration. As a straight SF novel today, it's barely OK - the characters are unlikable, the science magical, & the romance is ridiculous - yet it manages to leverage these weaknesses into a story that is really intriguing & even inspiring, if you can put your sense of disbelief on hold. Gully Foyle, the MC, certainly isn't a hero. He's a beast that slowly becomes not just human, but the epitome of humanity in many ways. His crude, bestial drive leads him to break long established boundaries & eventually inspire all of humanity in a devil's deal delivered in the low class argot of the time. \"Take a war to make you spend. Take a jam to make you think. Take a challenge to make you great. Rest of the time you sit around lazy, you. Pigs, you! All right, God damn you! I challenge you, me. Die or live and be great. Bow yourselves to Christ gone or come and find me, Gully Foyle, and I make you men. I make you great. I give you the stars.\"Fantastic. The neat ideas:- Synesthesia was known back then, but I've read this was one of the earliest popular novels that used it.- One of the early, best examples of modern cybernetics. Not just as a prosthetic, but as augmentation.- Time/space/dimensions as parts of a whole.- Religion outlawed & become a 'filthy practice', yet people still use its words for profanity. Not explored enough, though.- The drug 'analogue', not explored enough, but really intriguing.- What psi powers would do to people & society. The main power is that most can teleport, but telepathy was also used to great advantage.There were more. Many weren't explored well enough, but created the impression of a real world, drawn with broad, exacting strokes that teased.Many of the things I disliked about the novel were also strengths. For instance, Olivia, the pampered daughter of one of the richest, most amoral men on Earth, is 'blind', yet she's not. She simply sees in a different spectrum than the rest & her character makes absolutely no sense. In one scene she sees things no one else can & revels in her power, yet in another she uses this as a reason for hating humanity. The dated treatment of the female characters doesn't help, but her sight was really unique, interesting, & disappointing.The elite families of the Earth were ludicrous & dated, but fun both for the way they were caricatured & for the names themselves. While most were recognizable today, I doubt many today would recognize Esso, once a household name, but immersed since the 70s in the Exxon brand. Anyway, it was kind of a blast from the past.I think I read this way back when, but had forgotten most of it. I recently stumbled across a list in my documents \"The Top 100 Audio Science Fiction Books\". There are actually only 99 on the list & one of those is a duplicate, so it's not to be taken too seriously. Still, it was enough to spur me to listening to this & I'm glad I did. It's not a long book & one of the foundations of SF. It's worth reading, but don't go into it expecting modern SF. It has warts, but should be treasured for them."}, {"userName": "Bill", "userReviewDate": "Apr 07, 2009", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/1811095-bill", "userReview": "when i was much younger, in my teens and early to mid twenties, i read a lot of sf.it was fun, it was exciting and full of adventure. then when i got into my later twenties, i pretty much lost interest. i'd read a lot of the classic stuff, a lot of the authors i liked were either retired or dead, and fantasy was taking over from science fiction with books about dragons and wizards and their ilk, and that really didn't turn me on.so then, for close to 30 years, i read very little sf at all and i priimarily read what is somewhat ambiguously called literary fiction, even though good genre fiction should be able to be classed as literature, but usually isn't. then, all of a sudden, for reasons that escape me, i started reading sf again recently.and let me digress for a minute. i have never liked the fact that sf stood for science fiction, yet encompassed many books that have no science in them whatsoever. most fantasy novels for example.i think it was harlan ellison,one of my favorite authors, who first suggested that sf should stand for speculative fiction instead. i couldn't agree more as this would cover all of the extremely wide range of books that are lumped under sf.the stars my destination is a shining example of everything that's good about sf. it's a revenge story, it's a love story, it's even kind of a rags to riches story. but above all, it's pretty much non-stop action, with fantastic, memorable characters.it's possible that i may have read this book many years ago, as it was written in 1956, but i don't think so because i'm pretty sure i would have remembered at least some of it.bester really only wrote two novels of consequence, this one and the demolished man, but with these two books he left behind quite a legacy. on the back of this book, robert silverberg says it is \"on everybody's list of the ten greatest sf novels\". i couldn't agree more, it's an absolute classic. i'm sure that most people who are into sf will have already read this. if not i strongly urge you to do so. immediately. and for any neophytes looking to dip their toe in, this would be a great place to start."}, {"userName": "Libros Prestados", "userReviewDate": "Mar 12, 2018", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/36773851-libros-prestados", "userReview": "Ya son dos los libros que he le\u00eddo de Bester y si tuviera que resaltar algo de \u00e9l es que no te deja indiferente.

If I recall correctly, Sam Delany recommended it in The Jewel-Hinged Jaw. Gaiman wrote the intro (which I'll read after I write this review). I guess I see some of what they saw here. There is a prefiguration of some of the schemae that would later become standard in the works of Gibson and Gaiman and Stephenson et al., things like the atmosphere of carnival, the antihero, the juxtaposition of high and low in a bubbling melting pot, the ironic fetishization of the past, the corruptibility and corruption of essentially all governmental institutions, the transfigurative and transgressive climax. I can see calling this some sort of proto-cyberpunk. And I do like the ending! In retrospect, it's quite poorly constructed and mars an already fragile story. But it is incredibly courageous, and it's exciting to see an author trying and failing rather than sort of letting the autopilot coast on in. This is not the playful idiocy of The Number of the Beast. This is a real, honest attempt to do something different that falls flat.But a failed ambitious ending and a little bit of prefiguration are not enough to save this book from its many heinous flaws. I will only mention in passing that the technologies and so on are utterly unbelievable and that none of that part of the book makes any sense even on its own terms (the small size of the explosions, the apparent incompetence of the commandoes, the lack of anything *other* than the burning man as foreshadowing, and I could go on). I really want to focus on two interrelated aspects of the book that really hampered my ability to enjoy it. First is the social structure. It's enough to make me appreciate Heinlein's pedophilia-bordering sex-obsession. This is a problem with so much science fiction from basically every era, where the technology is pushed into the future but the social structure, despite a little lip service, remains entirely planted in the author's present. It is just as unforgivable in John Brunner's future-70s as it is in Bester's future-50s. Bester posits a game-changing, difference-leveling disruptive technology, and then fails to follow through on its actual implications, preferring instead to wed his idea of the disruption to his own prejudices. The place that this shows up the worst, and the vilest problem with this book, is in the gender politics. Bester has fundamentally misunderstood something about the role of women in society. Yes, there is the Handmaid's Tale. But there's a reason that Atwood doesn't like to be called a science fiction writer, and this is part of it! This is a sloppy, ill-conceived purdah, and the women, even the women who are central to the plot, are there to guide its progress and not to have internal lives. And the structure, we see in retrospect, makes absolutely no sense. Women can jaunte. They can jaunte wherever they want. The idea that they'd mostly stay passive in the face of their systematic (re-)rendering as property is hard to swallow.But much worse than the gender politics per se is the use of sexual violence. Rape is a plot point, but Bester shrugs back and forth between taking it seriously and dismissing its importance in a fundamentally dishonest manner. I complained bitterly about this kind of thing in The Diamond Age, and you can run a lineage straight back to this novel. It is such a disappointment that so much of science fiction was and is still trapped in this male echo chamber where rape is either debilitating (Robin), desired (Olivia), or irrelevant (again Robin). It's like echoes of Ayn Rand in the Gully-Olivia interactions, with an extremely mild condemnation underlain by the bullshit affirmative power of a bit of contrition.This idea of love leading to redemptive atonement and absolution is what I take away as the book's moral core, and I just cannot abide by that. Much better to follow the martyrdom route and let Foyle burn than to posit a happy-ever-after world where he and his rape victim sing Kumbaya together.Ultimately a very disappointing read, albeit one with some not insignificant historical interest."}, {"userName": "Muratcan", "userReviewDate": "Apr 25, 2017", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/43699411-muratcan", "userReview": "Eski bilimkurgu kitaplar\u0131n\u0131 de\u011ferlendirirken, i\u015flenen temalar\u0131 ve kullan\u0131lan bilimsel zamazingolar\u0131 d\u00f6nemin \u015fartlar\u0131na g\u00f6re de\u011ferlendirmek gerek.
