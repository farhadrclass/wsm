They contend with foes lurking within the heart, enemies that are just as deadly as those waiting for them in the darkest recesses of the alien stronghold; face tests of loyalty, to themselves, to each other and the very tenets by which they live; endure hardships severe enough to crush the spirit.And then there\u2019s the legend himself. It would seem even Tempus isn\u2019t immune to the consequences his choices bring.\u201cStorm Seed\u201d a superb example of how to write an action adventure that bridges the divide between science fiction and fantasy, and a classic that will endure the test of time. I loved the pace and intensity of this storyline. It keeps you riveted from the moment you start and doesn\u2019t let go until the last page."}, {"userName": "A.L.

It is light years ahead of other SciFi novels. Tempus the immortal comes to life in this story along with other futuristic hybrid characters that are unforgettable. Travel to Lemuria and get ready for a full-ride futuristic fantasy!"}, {"userName": "Zoe Saadia", "userReviewDate": "Oct 12, 2017", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/5852913-zoe-saadia", "userReview": "Back to mystical Lemuria - if only! The \"Sacred Band\" Author's Cut is a wonderful addition to the fans of this series. I read it in nearly one sitting, unable to put it down, delighted to get re-acquitted with beloved characters, both those who I rooted for or hated, or pitied, or prayed for. Neither Tempus nor his follows disappoint, ever!"}, {"userName": "Joe Bonadonna", "userReviewDate": "Feb 24, 2018", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/5464289-joe-bonadonna", "userReview": "It seems like a reunion as so many characters from previous novels return to share the stage. Tempus the Black and Niko, his right-side companion, are here. Also present and accounted for: the goddess Jihan, the powerful Froth Daughter; Randal the allergy-prone wizard; Roxane the witch you really don\u2019t want to get involved with; Cime the wizard slayer who is a real force to be reckoned with; Kama, Tempus\u2019 daughter and warrior. The Sacred Banders Strat, Crit, and Gayle are also here, as well as Enlil the Storm God, Abarsis the Slaughter Priest, and even Strat\u2019s Ghost Horse. Tempus is reunited with Faun, too \u2014 the Shepherd of Sandia, a realm \u201ca thousand years from Lemuria.\u201d He first encountered her in Tempus Unbound, when she traveled to Lemuria seeking help in saving her dying land.As the story begins, Tempus and Cime now rule in Lemuria, and have settled into Pinnacle House, which contains portals to other times and places. One of these portals leads to Sandia.The overriding theme of Storm Seed is \u201csearching.\u201d Jihan searches for her son, Cyrus, who has run off to look for Tempus, his father. Roxane has escaped her prison in hell to find her beloved Niko; she kidnaps his son Nino in order to draw Niko away from Princess Tabet and the City at the Edge of Time, so she can have him all to herself. Kama seeks a purpose in life, to earn her rightful place among the Sacred Band. Randal searches for Niko and the other members of the Sacred Band. As for Tempus . . . he is still the avatar of Enlil the Storm God, who dwells inside him. Now Tempus seeks to reunite the Sacred Band for another mission, this time to the future world of Sandia, to help Faun and her people, while, Cime is left behind to rule and protect Lemuria. So, while Cyrus (son of Jihan and Tempus) searches for his father, he uses his shape-shifting talents during his travels among mortal men and women, and those don\u2019t always turn out for the best. Roxane the witch has her own agenda, and plans to enslave Niko and use him to strike at Enlil, the Storm God, and Tempus, his avatar . . . and destroy them both. When Cyrus first encounters Roxane, who has turned herself into a black dragon, he becomes enamored with her, and takes the shape of a white dragon. But they don\u2019t hit it off right away, and their battle is truly epic: they attack Lemuria and break through to the realm of Sandia, where they finally join forces and return to human form. In doing so, they destroy the portal leading to Sandia, thus leaving Cime trapped and alone in Lemuria. Cime must now race against time to repair the broken portal to Sandia so she can go warn and help Tempus. As for Cyrus, he must choose between his parents and his infatuation with Roxane.Once the Sacred Band has reunited and sets out on their quest in Sandia, the story takes another interesting turn. When Tempus first met Faun, he and the Storm God Enlil \u201ctook her\u201d one night. She should be with child, but she\u2019s not. Tempus discovers that his seed and her eggs had been harvested and placed in perfect wombs, where Sandian doctors can control gestation, and nurture to life more than one child born of the \u201cstorm seed\u201d of Enlil and Tempus. Sandia, as I\u2019ve already mentioned, is a future world, the farthest into the future that Tempus has ever gone, and the Sandians want to populate their dying world with children \u201cfathered\u201d by the deathless Tempus, whose seed will carry something of Enlil, the Storm God. Elements of science fiction and science fact now enter into Storm Seed: breeding programs, sperm banks, in vitro fertilization, closed ecologies . . . as well as a mystery to be solved. As always, there is a depth of grace and dignity in Team Morris\u2019 characters, even the villains. Compassion, drama, confrontation, and sadness can also be found in these characters and their interactions with each other, and in an emotional, climactic scene, there\u2019s a poignancy that adds to their depth and realism. There\u2019s also a statement being made in Storm Seed, a message which Team Morris has worked into the story, not by beating us over the head with it, but through the subtlety and elegance of their prose."}, {"userName": "Brett", "userReviewDate": "Apr 14, 2008", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/989632-brett", "userReview": "Fantasy"}, {"userName": "Gale Stanley", "userReviewDate": "Dec 22, 2017", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/3999412-gale-stanley", "userReview": "Mystical and brilliant.
