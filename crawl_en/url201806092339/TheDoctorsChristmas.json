Her characters are always engaging and her conflicts are always realistic, which can definitely be said for this book. I loved the setting, and although the novel was fairly short, I came to care about the inhabitants of Button Gap and the visitors to the free clinic. I felt like I connected better with Maggie than I did with Grant, but that often happens with romance novels. And the children were adorable! But more than that, they functioned as a way of bringing Maggie and Grant together. I know there are some romance readers who get fed up with children appearing in books just to make the reader say \"Aww\" but most of the time, I find that the children are the catalyst for the hero and heroine forming a relationship. I did wish that Grant's backstory had been explored a bit more. I think the secret about his brother might have been held back to make Grant seem more mysterious, but ultimately, it kind of seemed like the author had just forgot to explore it initially so it made it seem a little bit thrown-in at the end. I also found the conclusion to the book to be rather rushed. Although obviously I wanted Maggie and Grant to get together, I still felt like they had a long way to come in their relationship in the last few chapters, then suddenly, all of their problems were thrown out the window and they were jumping into a bit commitment together? Christian romance novels don't always have to end in a wedding! It just didn't seem entirely realistic, considering that they'd only known each other for a month and had struggled to trust each other for that entire time.Although a few sections of this book felt a bit rushed or skipped-over, this was a truly sweet Christmas read. The characters were realistically flawed and the setting was wonderful. If Marta has written any other books set in Button Gap, I'll definitely be looking out for them. 4*"}, {"userName": "Carole Jarvis", "userReviewDate": "Oct 24, 2012", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/2054668-carole-jarvis", "userReview": "I was surprised at how much I enjoyed this book! Sweet romance between a nurse and volunteer doctor at a free clinic in Applachia, one of my favorite settings."}, {"userName": "Summer", "userReviewDate": "Nov 25, 2017", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/21785806-summer", "userReview": "With three young children suddenly left in her care, Maggie, a nurse, is determined to keep them away from the foster system, certain their mother will be back for them soon. While Maggie knows her small-town will have her back about the kids, her trust in her new temporary co-worker, Grant, a doctor, is far shakier, as much as she grows to like him and feel attracted to him, they have very different ideas of doing right by these children.While I would have liked to see more dimension to the social worker (the author has a thoughtful note about that character and that very difficult profession at the end of the book), the emotional conflict she ignites was well done and easy to believe, both Maggie and Grant have solid reasons behind their arguments, it isn\u2019t that they just disagree because the plot requires it, these are firmly held beliefs shaped by their pasts. Though they\u2019ve both been through difficulities in their life, Maggie\u2019s already fairly well-adjusted by the time this story begins, it\u2019s more Grant\u2019s character who goes through a deeper change, which was nicely paced and made for a good heroic Christmas moment. I had a little more difficulty with the pacing of the romance, or really, just the pacing at the end when their relationship suddenly advanced to a place that I didn\u2019t feel they were at yet, if it had waited until just a few pages later in the epilogue, where more time had passed, it would have seemed a bit more realistic to me."}, {"userName": "Mary Baker", "userReviewDate": "Feb 26, 2017", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/2764513-mary-baker", "userReview": "This is my first Marta Perry book, but it won't be my last. I liked it. I enjoy the Love Inspired series because they provide good, clean stories that touch my heart. \"The Doctor's Christmas\" is an example of what I expect from this series. I loved being part of a small, warm, supportive community of people for a few hours. The author managed to involve me in discovering the life experiences that made Maggie and Grant into the people they had become. This was a fun but touching read about people sacrificing for others. ."}, {"userName": "Loraine", "userReviewDate": "Dec 15, 2013", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/1922494-loraine", "userReview": "SUMMARY: God could not have chosen a worse time to send Dr. Grant Hardesty to Button Gap. Three abandoned children were depending on Maggie Davis\u2019 s clandestine care until their mother returned. Maggie didn\u2019 t think she could trust the by-the-book doctor with her secret. Until she got a glimpse into his soul\u2026 and God\u2019 s mysterious ways became as clear as a starry night.Maggie knew her trust was well placed as this once-aloof doctor opened his heart to the children\u2026 and her. But as Grant\u2019 s time in Button Gap ended, she prayed for one more miracle. Could God make this man who seemed to have everything recognize that it all meant nothing without Maggie\u2019 s love?REVIEW: Another well-written novel with flawed main characters who have dealt with hard pasts but are trying to move forward. The pathos of the 3 children of course tugged on the reader's heartstrings, and it was nice to see how they opened up as they felt more loved and secure. I did think the ending was rather rushed in that Maggie and Grant had only known each other a month and suddenly he was proposing when there were still issues between them that needed to be worked out. FAVORITE QUOTES: \"If God is there, He could have saved Jason....\"God is there.\" Tears stung her eyes. \"I don't know why your brother died, but I know God was there holding him in His hands. I know God is ready to help you deal with it, if you'll let Him.\"\"Aunt Elly helped me see that I could either let my past destroy me or I could let God use it to make me stronger. Seeing Him as a true Father was a big step forward for me.\""}, {"userName": "Michelle Lunsford", "userReviewDate": "Dec 09, 2016", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/45521969-michelle-lunsford", "userReview": "The romance is about what I expected from an inspirational Christmas tale, but I like the plot involving broken people who find ways to help one another to discover love and hope. Faith is a central element, but I found it to be realistic and balanced. Although fictional characters were involved, I felt my own heart stirred with rejoicing over the wins in the spiritual battles represented in this narrative. This is definitely a nice feel-good holiday story I can enjoy revisiting year after year."}, {"userName": "April Suter", "userReviewDate": "Jun 28, 2013", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/4685969-april-suter", "userReview": "Grant volunteers to practice medicine in Button Gap for a short time before he starts his practice in the city.
