Shockingly good!It is very hard to describe a book like this as being exceptionally good. When reading books like these, words that come to mind are usually - horrifying, terrible, sad, painful, and I can think of a dozen others. This story is all of those, but it was written so well, even as the horrific details unfold I could not put it down! I know that horrible things like this do happen to young girls but in my little world - I like to not think of such things. This book opens it all up.This is going to be one of my favorite books of the year.The chapters take turns with the Point-of-view, so every other chapter or so you are hearing right from the heart of Tiara. And boy does this girl get into your heart. I don't know if I have ever felt so much for a character before. What happens to her was so horrible, and I do know that this is fiction, but honestly it brings tears to my eyes just writing this review.The character development was so good you surprisingly also fall in love with the detective who is investigating her case and also her psychiatrist. All the character's personalities are developed so well.This book was good right from page one. It absolutely had me hooked. And I loved the ending! In a word - Amazing!I had never read anything by this author before, had not even heard of her. Now I am doing research and scrambling to find more books by her. If this one was that good her others must be at least as good. I very highly recommend this book, it is very suspenseful and gripping."}, {"userName": "Bookish Indulgenges with b00k r3vi3ws", "userReviewDate": "Jul 20, 2013", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/4556168-bookish-indulgenges-with-b00k-r3vi3ws", "userReview": "Tiara has always been a \u2018beauty queen\u2019.Tiara was raised by her mother and aunt from the very beginning as her father had lost his life to war. What starts as an easy way to earn money, soon turns to be something so much more sinister. Not only is nothing as beautiful and glittering as it looks like on the pageants circuit. When she is caught assaulting a lady, and its flashed on news, Tiara come in contact with a psychiatrist and a detective who take steps in order to help out Tiara. But the Doctor\u2019s suggestion of Tiara start writing a journal soon opens a can of worms that shock the readers.I have read Ms. Zeiner\u2019s work before. Her previous novel Section 132 dealt with a polygamous sect in Canada. As a well written novel dealing with a serious matter, this author had captured my heart right away and I had made it a point to keep out for her upcoming works. When this book came up for review for a Blog Tour, I knew I had to be part of it. But at the same time, I have to admit that I had picked up this book with some previous expectations. And am finally glad to report that I wasn\u2019t let down.The author has her own style of writing wherein she seamlessly mixes in facts and fiction to create a world for us. There\u2019s a certain \u2018darkness\u2019 about the plot and some of the characters in the story that absolutely took a grip on me. Horrified at moments by some of the characters, I pitied Tiara at times, felt bad for her most of the times and yes, finally I cheered for her. Tiara\u2019s character is a hope for humanity. She emerged as a strong person in the end \u2013 even after all the abuse and that gave me hope that maybe humanity\u2019s resilience is stronger than evil. The author has also dealt with some serious issues \u2013 from the world of child beauty pageants to paedophilia with great deal of sensitivity and originality. The plot and characters are supported by and excellent narration style wherein we hear the story from multiple point of views thus giving us a chance to make up our own mind about each character.Awesome book. Do not pick up this book if you are looking for a light fun read or to get tips on fashion or learn about brands. (try Pretty Little Liars Series for that). But in case you are a serious reader who likes to know more about \u2018facts\u2019 through fiction, or like to read books that touch your heart, or makes you really think, please go ahead and pick this one up."}, {"userName": "Abigail", "userReviewDate": "Jun 01, 2013", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/6100497-abigail", "userReview": "How anyone could give anything but a five star review is beyond me.

That was my first thought upon completion. Reading this summary, I find it hard for anyone not to have some idea \u2013 however vague \u2013 of what all this book might entail. Don\u2019t let that fool you into thinking you have it all worked out. You most definitely do not! Full of twists, turns, loops, and shocking revelations, Birthdays of a Princess by Helga Zeiner had me captivated from the very start.Before I continue, however, feel it necessary to warn you: If you consider yourself a sensitive reader, consider this book with caution. This book deals with child exploitation, and while not overly graphic, it tells enough that would make even the most stoic of readers squirm.Now that you\u2019re been warned, I shall proceed. As I mentioned above, this book had me hooked pretty much from the start. It\u2019s compelling, mysterious, and very well-written. Why not a higher rating? Well, despite there being some twists, turns, and surprises, I was able to guess at most of what was happening. So, while it was crafty, it was not crafty enough for me. Hopefully, though, others will find these twists and turns a bit more shocking than I did. There still were, though, things that surprised me. Or, things that I figured out as they were being revealed (meaning shortly before the characters figured it out).Speaking of the characters, they were interesting. Tiara \u2026 once she starts to soften and open up, I found her actually a great character. Her part of most of the book is told by her in first-person voice. Once you get inside her head and start to understand her, she really doesn\u2019t seem quite so villainous anymore. I had to regularly remind myself that this is a 15-year-old girl. Only 15. Poor kid had to grow up way too quickly. The adults in her life are \u2026 interesting. Her life before this incident, well, the adults are mostly horrible. Her mother has got to be the most selfish woman \u2026 ugh. I won\u2019t get started, because I don\u2019t want to give anything away. Let\u2019s just say that I get being depressed when the love of your life dies. I totally get that. But, when you have a child, you just don\u2019t get to check out the way she did. The whole time the case is under investigation, this woman is worried about how it makes her look. Not how her daughter is, but how she comes out looking as a result of this! And don\u2019t get me started on the other adults. The adults Tiara comes in contact with once she\u2019s in custody, thankfully, are much better. Excellent, really.If you enjoy crime fiction, psychological thrillers, or just plain mysteries, I think it\u2019s safe to say this is likely right up your alley. Just remember, again, that if you are a sensitive reader \u2013 especially when it comes to mistreatment of children \u2013 you might want to proceed with caution. While I generally \u201cenjoyed\u201d the book, there are parts that are pretty difficult to read. Part of me doesn\u2019t like saying that I enjoyed it \u2013 there are parts that clearly aren\u2019t very enjoyable. But, given that you\u2019re likely a fellow reader, I\u2019m thinking you likely know what I mean. So, yes, I would recommend this."}, {"userName": "Cheryl", "userReviewDate": "Jul 08, 2013", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/2490212-cheryl", "userReview": "Birthdays of a Princess by Helga ZeinerPublished by POW WOW BooksPublication Date: May 9, 2013ISBN: 978-0-9868798-7-6Pages: 290Review Copy from: AuthorEdition: ARC KindleMy Rating: 4Synopsis (from Amazon):To be famous and be admired by total strangers can be very dangerous.Her little girl has always been her princess.

Just when you think you know the ending\u2026read on, the ultimate surprise waits at the end of the thrill-ride.My Thoughts and Opinion:I was first introduced to this author when I read and reviewed her novel, Section 132, which was a page turner. Birthdays of a Princess hooked me by the end of the Prologue. A mother, watching TV, is shocked when she realizes the attacker of a brutal stabbing of a woman, the news is reporting on, was her 15 year old daughter. But why? And who is this victim? Was it a random act? After Tiara's arrest, a painful and emotional journey begins for why this child committed this vicious crime. Secrets that have been repressed come to light. And the only way she can recall these horrifying memories is to correlate it to her birthdaysBirthdays of a Princess is an intense psychological thriller and might be considered disconcerting by some readers, but unfortunately in today's world, it is also a reality. A tale of extreme trauma and exploitation of a child. A mother's selfishness and inability to parent. The betrayal of adults that were the protectors. Secrets, lies, greed and drugs. A child perpetrator that is truly the victim. And her quest for healing.Birthdays of a Princess is a chilling fictional read, but sadly, is also a real life actuality. Scary!! A white knuckle, edge of your seat read!!"}, {"userName": "Teena in Toronto", "userReviewDate": "May 15, 2013", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/7481874-teena-in-toronto", "userReview": "Melissa has lost control of her 15-year-old daughter, Tiara. She is watching the news one day and discovers that Tiara has been arrested for stabbing a woman, perhaps to death, in a coffee shop ... there is no doubt she did it. Tiara is taken to a youth correctional centre and refuses to see her mother.Police officers Mackenzie and Harding are assigned to the case. Mackenzie is months away from retirement and had been looking forward to gliding into it. ... so he's not happy to be involved in this case. Tiara is assigned a psychiatrist, Stanley Eaton, to determine her mental state. She is at first non-communicative so he gives her a notebook and encourages her to use it as a diary to record her thoughts. We learn that Tiara was a former child beauty pageant winner and had been the breadwinner for her mother and her aunt, Gracie (her dead father's sister). We find out what leads her to do what she that day in Starbucks. The title refers to the thoughts in her diary ... she lists her birthdays and what had been going on at that time.This is the first book I've read by this author. It took me a bit to get used to the writing style but once I did, I enjoyed this story. It is written from two points of view ... first person when the focus is on Tiara and third person when it is everyone else. As a head's up, the language and some activity is for mature readers.The story was an interesting one. If you watch \"Toddlers and Tiaras\" and remember JonBen\u00e9t Ramsey, you'll know what Tiara had gone through as a child beauty pageant contestant.There were very few characters that I liked when I started this book. Tiara was a willful saucy teenager but I grew to like her as the story went on and I got to know her and her background and she let her guard down. She was so sheltered with Melissa and Gracie that she doesn't know how to relate to others, especially those her own age (she was always homeschooled). Mackenzie was an A-hole, begrudgingly having to take on this case but once he realizes what Tiara has gone through, he becomes her biggest supporter and will do anything to solve the case. Melissa is extremely weak and is a horrible mother and left most of the raising of Tiara to Gracie, who is an unscrupulous character (she's a drug dealer).I would recommend this book.Blog review post: http://www.teenaintoronto.com/2013/06..."}, {"userName": "Kathleen", "userReviewDate": "Jul 18, 2013", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/4239132-kathleen", "userReview": "Birthdays of a Princess is a fascinating yet very disturbing story of the traumatic manipulation and exploitation of a child.

I chose to read and review this one because I enjoyed the other one, Section 132, so much. Although the topic of this book is much different from the first one, both books have very strong teen females as the main character.This book is a very well-written psychological thriller that moves along at a decent space. It has enough twists and turns along the way to keep the reader interested. There are also enough clues and hidden details to keep the reader guessing to the end.Initially I had little sympathy for the 'Princess' in the story, especially the way in which she committed her crime and them seemed to be very uncooperative. However, as the story started of her short life so far started to be revealed I found myself starting to understand how she had come to be the way that she was. In describing the life of the main character, Ms Zeiner pulls no punches and gets into things that some people may even find hard to believe exist in the seemingly widespread way that they do. I don't want to give anything away, so you will have to read the book to understand what I am talking about.There are some strong secondary characters as well and it's great to see their stories being revealed bit by bit and finding out where they are all headed.I have to say that I enjoyed this one more than I thought I would and that it is a definite page turner that draws the reader in. The book puts the reader through a whole spectrum of emotions and this may be what made it so enjoyable for me. I look forward to the next book from Helga Zeiner, because so far I have read two excellent thrillers from her."}, {"userName": "Kristi (Books and Needlepoint)", "userReviewDate": "Jun 30, 2013", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/1699270-kristi-books-and-needlepoint", "userReview": "I devoured this book - the Prologue (see below) pulled me in and I just had to finish the book. The author did a great job of keeping you right on the edge of your seat. Tia is Melissa's daughter, and she was raised by Melissa and Gracie after her father was killed in Afghanistan on the day she was born. This family was dysfunctional from the start. Melissa retreated into her own world and Gracie raised Melissa like she was her own child for the first couple of years. I use the phrase \"like her own chld\" loosely here as I don't know any mother who would put their child through what these two did. Gracie was the true criminal here while Melissa's crime was just being negligent and keeping her eyes closed to what was going on.After Tia is arrested, she refuses to talk to anyone. A very caring (and clever) Dr. Eaton or \"psycho-doc\" as she calls him, gets her to trust him and convinces her to start keeping a journal. She documents her life through her birthdays and what happens each year. She finally reaches a point though, that she can't remember what happened, or just refuses to remember what happened. She lets Dr. Eaton read her journal - I think because it is all too painful for her to say out loud - but she wants someone to know.Between her journal writings and conversations that Melissa has with her also dysfunctional mother Louise, you begin to learn about Tia's life. At times it is almost too painful to read, but I couldn't put it down. The tension was just enough to keep me riveted. I really liked how the author resolved the book and brought some lost souls together in the end."}, {"userName": "Fenny", "userReviewDate": "Jun 11, 2013", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/10519901-fenny", "userReview": "This story grabs your attention from the beginning, as you turn page after page to find out the reason for Tiara\u2019s attack of this \u2013 initially \u2013 unknown lady.

So, I knew I was in for a treat when I picked up Birthdays of a Princess. The story opens with Tiara 'Tia' stabbing a random woman in a coffee shop and her mom seeing it on the news. What would bring such a young woman to do such a violent and volatile act?As the investigation begins, the reader is given a glimpse into Tia and her mom's past, along with Tia's Aunt Gracie. Tia was pushed into the beauty pageant scene at a very young age and stayed in it until she was too old to compete. The change in her psych is dramatic at that point when she is expected to return to a normal childhood.Her mother can't seem to associate the rebellious and extremely troubled teen with her sweet little girl. She takes no responsibility for her daughter's actions and feel that what she did for Tia was to her benefit. The psychologist in charge of Tia's case urges her to journal her life up to that point and Tia uses her birthdays as pivotal times in her life. But there are deeper and darker secrets yet to be revealed that will hold you captive.Page-turning, steeped in suspense and cleverly constructed characters that will grab you from the first page and not let go until the shocking end. This book kept me riveted and I read it in two sittings, so abhorrent to putting it down. It really brought forth a myriad of emotions, from humor, horror, shock, anger and more.

I think it's important to understand how depraved the world can get, especially if you are a parent. It's very explicit, and I had to skip a few parts, because it was just so unsettling for my brain and heart. I guess that means it was written very well. I know it was a tough read because while it's a work of fiction, it's not. There are real victims as portrayed in this story. I already despise beauty pageants. Our daughter was invited to do modeling and pageants on a regular basis. We felt they were exploitative and taught a very wrong and negative sense of self. This story takes what our fears were look like Disneyland. It's not for the faint of heart. Having said that, I think it's eye opening, and has real value.

I liked the book because it does not take up the banner to defend the cause of these children. She simply tells a story and paints a very clear picture of what happens behind scenes. Amazing what some people are capable of doing to satisfy their own personal selfish needs."}, {"userName": "Susan", "userReviewDate": "Jul 22, 2013", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/5114331-susan", "userReview": "Helga Zeiner pens \"Birthdays of a Princess\" in a psychological thriller plot that just captivates you from the start. The plot does get a little dark but I found it to be very well constructed and thought through. The author's characters were very well developed, believable and realistic, making this a totally breathtakingly fantastic read that will have your emotions soaring. Highly recommended.This review is based on a complimentary copy from the author which was provided for an honest review."}, {"userName": "J&B Reviews", "userReviewDate": "Mar 21, 2014", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/24431657-j-b-reviews", "userReview": "Good thrillerThis was a good story. It's a chilling reminder of just how low some people can sink. To think that a mother and an aunt could do that to a child is almost beyond belief. In spite of what she had done it was impossible not to root for Tiara.I recommend this book but feel that anyone who is interested in reading it should be aware of just how disturbing it is. I also want to mention that it could have benefited greatly from a good editor. Three and a half stars for a book that should have been four and a half if not for all those grammatical errors."}, {"userName": "Katbyrdie", "userReviewDate": "Feb 04, 2014", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/5048117-katbyrdie", "userReview": "Read this book in just a few days. Dealt with child abuse very well. The main character's response to violence was realistic and nothing felt drawn out or added for shock value, which happens a lot in stories like this. The twists were somewhat predictable, but that didn't take away from the well-written thriller."}, {"userName": "Stacey Mullins", "userReviewDate": "Sep 02, 2014", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/31958853-stacey-mullins", "userReview": "The character, Tia, was complex and an adult in some ways. It's a terrible reminder what goes on under the radar with children. Well written book. I didn't think the Grandmother added anything to the story. She was just thrown in and there was not room for her, all of a sudden. The twist of who the Purple Shadow was interesting. Liked that the detective and psych were portrayed positivity."}, {"userName": "Debra", "userReviewDate": "Feb 27, 2014", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/5750980-debra", "userReview": "This is not the type of book I usually read. A teenage walks into a Starbucks and viciously stabs a woman. The story is mostly the why she did it. It tells about her disturbing childhood and her family. It also has a great twist at the end."}, {"userName": "Brenda Duel", "userReviewDate": "May 13, 2014", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/15486656-brenda-duel", "userReview": "very interesting book about a difficult subject. although the subject matter is disgusting to most, it was handled in a clear but not explicit way. good mystery also with suspense. nice twists and turns to keep you guessing."}, {"userName": "Mary Jo Tranghese", "userReviewDate": "Mar 02, 2014", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/2914077-mary-jo-tranghese", "userReview": "This is a psychological thriller at its best!
