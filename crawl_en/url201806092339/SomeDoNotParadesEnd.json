I so often had the feeling that there was a great deal of context and subtext that I was utterly missing, when vast sums of meaning are conveyed in a mere, 'Oh, darling...'I probably shouldn't have read this book as a way to pull myself out of a reading funk. It's pretty tough to go from absolutely no attention span to stream of consciousness!"}, {"userName": "Caroline", "userReviewDate": "Mar 06, 2014", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/5261455-caroline", "userReview": "This must be one of the novels, if not the only novel, that one reads for the centenary of the Great War. Ford is an erudite social anthropologist, describing every detail of a highly evolved social structure in the process of simultaneously portraying its implosion. So that it would be a challenge to assign it to most undergraduate classes today, I think; they would protest that they don\u2019t have a clue what anyone is talking about. What nonsense is Tietjiens going on about? \u2013 they didn\u2019t sign up to learn a dead language. But they should. Ford is astounding, working on so many levels in every scene. A brilliant example: the early set piece in the country club where the general tells off the two \u2018City men\u2019 for coarse talk and then proceeds himself to talk of how a gentleman handles an affair, but of course in the only acceptable upper class manner. In between these items, Ford, at the keyboard, plays a four-part conversational fugue -- so perfect.There follows a midnight cart ride through the countryside where we come to know the two main characters in their hearts and souls, and we understand why they will become soul mates. This conversation, which tellingly takes place in the dark, shines in contrast to the obscured upper class language of Tietjen\u2019s wife and best friend, and others from the worlds of (Catholic) church, army, White Hall, intellectual salons, landed gentry, etc.Mostly, though, Ford gives the reader the heart and guts of men and women before and during wartime, caught in social conventions that lead them to do both noble and despicable things. Ford wrings one\u2019s heart without sentimentality, and forces understanding for those who cause pain through their own hurt and frustration. He takes your breath away with his art.This first book in the tetralogy Parade\u2019s End does not reach the battlefront, but the war is never far away. Nor is Ford\u2019s contempt for men and women who treat the war as another political exercise, or an opportunity for profiteering, and who are willing to wink at ethnical niceties. One very interesting point is Ford\u2019s treatment of women\u2019s influence on political affairs and war policy. This echoes the same issue in another book I read recently, The General by C. S. Forester. Well-educated, well-to-do women with no chance at a career and a will to power lead to trouble.One of the most interesting questions, for me, is how Ford feels about the politics of his characters. Tietjens is a Tory\u2014Does Ford admire his party? All of Ford\u2019s other men of the ruling class are oblivious, stuffed shirts or hypocritical cads. Is Ford saying that Tories have fine ideals and England depends on people actually living up to them, as Tietjens does? Or is he saying that the Tories wave a flag with Tietjens\u2019 ideals on it to perpetuate the class structure as an admirable, chivalrous and benevolent institution that everyone ought to be thankful for\u2014but in fact in fact the Tories are only out for themselves, manipulating war policy as profiteers and ensuring safe postings for their sons? The politics of the other characters are not held up as a better alternative; see Valentine\u2019s brother\u2019s communism and Sylvia\u2019s vague German sympathies. Ford has no simplistic answers, and I look forward to seeing how he develops this aspect of the work over the next three parts of Parade\u2019s End. Carcanet publishes what looks to be a marvelous, fully edited and commented edition of all four volumes, but I\u2019m going to read the novels cold the first time. Later I\u2019ll go back and learn about his politics and who he was writing about, because surely these characters must be modeled on real people in some cases.As for the writing, one has to be knocked over by how Ford uses his own deep learning and experience to set his knight in a modernist flow of consciousness and make it work. He shows, rather than tells, how brilliant Tietjens is\u2014a very hard thing to do convincingly unless you\u2019re brilliant yourself. Ford also shows how Tietjens is simultaneously emblematic of his class in his love of land and system, and unusual for his contempt and willingness to rip apart the conventions of overlooking unpleasant things that involve his peers. Perhaps the most amazing thing is that Tietjens is not a prig\u2014you don\u2019t feel either disbelief that a man could hold these beliefs and act on them so conscientiously, or the revulsion usually directed at the scrupulous\u2014because Ford so clearly distinguishes between virtuous and righteous. The contradictory nature of Tietjens is evident from the first, but Ford ingeniously introduces the modernist style gradually. There are time shifts from the first, but signaled in the usual way. At some point, however, the reader is yanked into unsignalled shifts in viewpoint and temporality, and the interior thoughts become more and more like those of Joyce or Woolf.

I came to this books solely through the BBC adaptation - and my weird love for the funny-named Englishman who graced the role of Christopher Tietjens. From my experience with the telly series, I can already tell you that Tietjens is one of my favourite literary characters. There are plenty who would call him dumb or stupid, at the least, but this book gives a fantastic breakdown of him as a character, of the people who surround him, and show exactly what happens when people (Tietjens) mind their own business, and those around them (basically every other character) are left to mouth-off and gossip in the streets. My feelings toward other characters have changed since reading this first installment - the Macmasters are snivelling and conniving. Poor Valentine is a little inexperienced, but I think she is still a virtuous character and Sylvia, well, she'd probably have her own reality show if she were born into this generation."}, {"userName": "Jamie Bradway", "userReviewDate": "Apr 05, 2013", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/4193350-jamie-bradway", "userReview": "Ford is very, very thorough.

First published as a series of books, Some Do Not\u2026, No More Parades, A Man Could Stand Up\u2013, and The Last Post, in the 1920s. I read the Vintage edition of all four stories together, published in 1950/1978.All authors have their overused words. For Rowling in the Potter series, it was \u201cpant.\u201d For Rowling later on, it was all about \u201cthick legs.\u201d For me, it seems to be \u201cface\u201d or \u201cgaze.\u201d For Tolstoy, it was \u201csuperfluous\u201d (at least in translation). And for Ford, well, he has a number of them, which at times he is doing on purpose. The worst one, by far, is \u201clachrymose.\u201d If I have to read \u201clachrymose\u201d one more time\u2026This book is a tetralogy. Ford, in fact, never saw it as the omnibus Parade\u2019s End, even though he suggested the title. However, when Graham Greene did a release of it many years ago, he left off the last book, saying that Ford himself wrote The Last Post superfluously (tee hee) and that he later regretted its inclusion. I was, therefore, torn between reading it as a trilogy or in its entirety. It helped that I had a terrible time getting through it at all. I left it at the trilogy. Many Parade fans would be appalled, for even though the last book is supposedly very different, it does have its proponents. Okay, I\u2019ll admit, I skimmed it, and nothing called out to me.This is another one of those books listed without fail in the top one hundred best books, wherever you might find that list. It has been called the greatest war novel(s) of all time, as well as the best of the 20th century. It does not have the large base of obsessive followers as many of the other chart-toppers (Anna Karenina, The Great Gatsby, Don Quixote, etc.), and it is clear why. It is a difficult read. Or, in the words of some article I read months ago and can not now find, it is a dying novel. Sure, it has themes and stories that could transcend, but its language and literary devices are wearing thin.The writing style is somewhere between stream-of-consciousness and chunky time jumps (backwards and forwards). Ford\u2019s writing is replete with repeated words and phrases, amazingly sustained run-on sentences, and ellipses. (If ellipses vex you, I beg you not to pick up this book.) Particular moments in time are relived again and again, the whole 730 dense pages adding up to maybe a total of ten actual scenes. Points are driven into the reader\u2019s head until it\u2019s simply buzzing. I believe all of this comes from the stream-of-consciousness thing, and it\u2019s a style I have a very hard time enjoying. Perhaps it\u2019s because I don\u2019t think in meandering tirades of words. I think in pictures. Meandering, messy, repetitive tirades of words are tiresome to me.And yet I can appreciate many things about this novel(s). You are really able to get in to a couple of the character\u2019s heads. The characters, in general, are extremely finely drawn. So is leftover Victorian England. So is war, or at least WWI. You\u2019ve got this great love triangle, and an exploration of fresh topics, like one\u2019s upbringing and theories versus their passion and circumstances. And Sylivia? She\u2019s just one big train wreck of a personality disorder, and I heartily enjoyed reading her on tenterhooks.But I found myself wishing, very frequently, that Ford\u2019s writing style had been very, very different. I appreciate his care and perspective; I can\u2019t tolerate his voice. I want to play editor, and demand that he cut the whole thing by at least half, re-order it into sequential events, and flesh out a few of the supporting characters and subplots. Plus, give us more action! Then, I\u2019m afraid, the whole thing would be dead, a mangled, lifeless thing, the harrowing tension gone. Which is what the book is, really: a very tight winding in the distinct voice of the times.Not a re-read for me. Can\u2019t say I regret having read it. It took me forever. If I was forced to choose one to re-read, it would definitely be A Man Could Stand Up\u2013, which has some achingly beautiful language and moments.__________I had decided to move this book up on my queue when I saw that the new British TV series was written by Tom Stoppard. (For Stoppard reviews, see here and here.) Of course, Cumberbatch fever helped.I ended up watching the whole five-part series while I was on a break from reading the novel, which has confused me considerably. From what I can recall, the series is a great representation of the novel(s). It has that sort of fractured, in-his-head, finely-drawn characters feel, and it covers just about all the scenes, at least in the middle two books. There were some plot changes that I am not sure about. It could have been that I misunderstood something. It could have been that not reading the last book put me at a disadvantage. It could have been Stoppard added things for translation into movie. Plus, for a book which gathers most of its sexual steam by being definitively demure, the series was a bit too overtly sexy for itself.Otherwise, fans of British TV and/or Cumberbatch will be happy with this series. It is true, as has been widely said, that he does a great job acting, as does Rebecca Hall.

It is, for sure, enormously ambitious. There's no hand-holding from the reader here. Events are unfurled as deeply analysed memories, in conversations between characters and it is far from linear; even on occasions where it remains so, it is quite happy to skip events of enormity and months that roll into years, leaving you to catch up as Madox Ford delves deeply into the consciousness of his leads.Chief among them is Christopher Tietjens, brilliant, challenging, selfless. He works for the Government as a civil servant, deriving statistics for the great and good and, as an entitled genius from a \"good family\", would have a career of undoubted greatness set before him were it not for the fact that he is incapable of kissing ass and taking names, a game he fails at miserably.Then the First World War and shell shock interrupt.Arguably it's problematic that the war itself is but a shadow in this novel - an inciting incident of sorts, no more. Tiejens consciousness, which is brilliantly explored in a modernist fashion so committed as to almost overwhelm, is affected and afflicted by the war but it is far from the be all and end all. I'm not an expert on the era, but it also explores the politics of women in that time to a degree i've yet to experience in another novel from that time.In short, it's a huge undertaking, and deftly executed. But I found myself tortured by it at times. The explorations are so enormous that they become, in and of themselves, the point. In fact, that is very clear. But as a narrative, it becomes entangled in its own cleverness, by my eye. A twenty page cart-ride is all well and good but the pay off is almost irrelevant. In this sense, the book reminded me of Joyce, but it lacks the same joy of exploration, of uniqueness. Taking this approach to, say, Middlemarch would have made it unreadable; Madame Bovary on the other hand enjoys a deftness and lightness of touch that steers it around some of the bogs Some Do Not... tends to charge headlong into.Additionally, and inevitably, some of the aspects which are \"of its time\" provides a different kind of turgidity. This is a book about the upper class \"For Tietjens held very strongly the theory that what finally separated the classes was tha tthe upper could lift its feet from the ground whilst common people couldn't.\"The book is awash with this sort of thing. I know and understand that this was the where and when that Madox was writing, but it does still grate a little. Tietjens (spoiler) returns from war at the beginning of part 2 and it is a great relief to finally have something to empathise with him over.I should add that my experience in reading this book was not helped by the Kindle version, which is atrocious. Three, sometimes four words get run together and punctuation is missing. I got used to it, but it made a challenging book perhaps too challenging which is a shame, because this is an interesting, powerful work.Not for me though, in the end; and nor the sequels."}, {"userName": "DGT", "userReviewDate": "Mar 08, 2017", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/40806936-dgt", "userReview": "\"What I stand for is gone.\"It says a lot for Ford Madox Ford\u2019s ability to expand the significance of a character by thoughtfully providing a social and historical context that Christopher Tietjens is indisputably the hero of \u201cSome Do not\u201d (1924). In retrospect, this is so from the moment we meet him on the branch-line to Rye. And, yet, Tietjens is variously described as a mad bullock, a dying bulldog, a hog, someone with lobster eyes, and even \u201codious\u201d by the woman who comes to love him. He rescues suffragists, without agreeing with their cause; is almost unbearably honourable, \"a regular Dreyfus\", according to one appalling character, the General, who adds \u201cthere, there, my dear boy. Come and have a sloe gin. That's the real answer to all beastly problems.\" Tietjens never reads a novel but can quote from any work of literature. Politically, his one-nation Toryism agrees with the far Left over a minimum wage and assuming the power to enforce it. And he is \"the last decent man in England\": \"I stand for monogamy ... and chastity. And for not talking about it.\" One interest in \"Some Do Not\" is discerning how many of the values of this unusual hero, Ford shares. Tietjens (and Ford?) trades in national stereotypes, following some of his worst with the observation that, with such characteristics, the French, Italian, Prussian, and American could never fathom the off-break. What saves Tietjens, not so much from readers (or at least me because, to my surprise, I am on his side from the outset), but from madness, is the horror of the coming 1914 War. \"One has to clear up. I'm going out\", he says in his buttoned-up voice. Possibly because he is above entitlement, when nearly all of the characters around him expect it, his qualities and his unwavering commitment to rights and duties endure, and to a greater extent than his predecessor in Ford\u2019s work: Edward Ashburnham, the hero of \u201cThe Good Soldier\u201d (1915), a novel that is usually more acclaimed but that I like less than \u201cSome Do Not\u201d. By way of a disagreement with most commentators, particularly Graham Greene, I had lots of sympathy with Sylvia Tietjens -- even as I admired Valentine Wannop\u2019s very different views -- not least because Christopher Tietjens is, at once, wonderful and awful, and living with him would be impossible.I look forward to reading the remaining three novels in the \u201cParades End\u201d series, including \u201cLast Post\u201d (1928), so disliked by Graham Greene, who, in some respects, is quite influenced by Ford. For the most direct influence, though minus most of the subtleties, one would probably turn to John Le Carr\u00e9\u2019s Smiley Trilogy, and especially the middle novel, \u201cThe Honourable Schoolboy\u201d and its titular hero."}, {"userName": "Jane E", "userReviewDate": "Aug 03, 2017", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/2301886-jane-e", "userReview": "The Good Soldier is such a charming and special book that I was expecting more than Some Do Not... delivered. The story is disjointed, in fact I lost the time sequence a couple of times and in the end it is not really about WWI but instead comes across as a bit of a bodice ripper. Some of the upper middle class British quirks are amusing such as someone having to resign from his club over a bounced cheque and the vocabulary is terrific.

And there is no way that I could behave like he does, in some of the circumstances.But that is what a role model is for.One tries to emulate and move in the direction shown by the role model, without standing much of a chance to be the same.Take his relationship with Sylvia, his wife.She is not just unfaithful, for she became a subject of gossip, with people calling her a tart, no less, even if without much insight.But the fact, admitted by Christopher Tietjens in front of Vincent Macmaster, his best friend, is that Sylvia is philandering.Tietjens is not even sure that her son is also his child.In such circumstances, a husband would be not just hostile and incriminating, but outright aggressive and looking for the way out.-\tWell, our hero is stating clearly that he will not divorce his wife!-\tAnd not just that, but he is the most decent, faithful protagonist that I have read or heard aboutChristian Tietjens has a special relationship and affection for Valentine Wannop, but gentleman as he is, he does not rush into an affair and at times he makes me mad with his reluctance to become intimate with the girl.There is also the aspect of money, which Tietjens gives freely to Macmaster, to the amount of thousands of pounds, which in the currency of today would translate into nearly a million $, while at the same time neglecting Valentine Wannop.-\tI mean, how can one bankroll a guy that in the end becomes the epitome of negligence and wasted effort, while ignoring one\u2019s loved one?-\tMiss Wannop and her mother have to endure hardship, while the miserable Macmaster and his awful wife get a knighthood and send Valentine awayBut then again, this is part of the charm and attraction of a complicated man as Christian Tietjens\u2026Valentine Wannop being close behind.She has a polemic with Mrs. Macmaster that has infuriated me.The older woman is as insulting as can be.And I was thinking:-\tFor heaven\u2019s sake, if it was me, I would give her a piece of my mind!But these are British people.Aware of circumstances, etiquette and rules.As a red neck, I would have shouted in the face of these ungrateful personages that they should be lucky to benefit from Tietjens.Instead of paying back what they owe and show eternal gratitude, because not only they have lived on money from the hero, but it was also his brilliant work that brought the title, they just say they do not want Valentine Wannop to attend the knighthood party\u2026-\tFuck you, would have been my message, with added expletives"}, {"userName": "Paul Frandano", "userReviewDate": "Mar 17, 2013", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/5861132-paul-frandano", "userReview": "Amid the curious Downton Abbey fancy that has swept up American television viewers (among whom I too am swept up), I decided to read Ford's tetralogy after having seen a New Republic review call the BBC/HBO television adaptation, in effect, \"Downton Abbey for grown-ups.\" Chronologically, the first installment of the four novels, Some Do Not..., covers much of the same ground as Downton Abbey but in a distinctively modernist way - jumping with little announcement from pre-WWI to post-WWI and back again, obliquely foreshadowing events readers will learn about only much later, if at all (other installments will fill in some of the blanks), with long stretches of stream-of-consciousness narration, and so on. (So many shades of Faulkner, well before Faulkner - at least in this first novel in the series - but written closer to the languorous, lapidary style of James as well taking up the clash between tradition and modernity that preoccupied both James and Faulkner). Ford is a master chronicler of the tensions posed by traditions under assault from urbanizing industrial society, the absurd slaughter on the continent and its hollowing out of a generation of promising Britons, and the rise of democratic political, social, and economic forces that would eventually overwhelm a decadent, impoverished aristocracy. Ford encapsulates all this splendidly in the saga of the dysfunctional Tietjens family - the brilliant, magnificently upright Christopher and the brilliant, beautiful, magnificently destructive Sylvia (portrayed, I must add, to absolute perfection for television by Benedict Cumberbatch and Rebecca Hall) as well as the inevitable third corner the triangle, the game, thoroughly modern, indefatigably loyal suffragette, Valentine Wannop, whose presence sharpens Tietjens family relations and drives the discordant narrative strains forward. No short commentary can convey the the majesty of Ford's writing or the keenness of his psychological perceptiveness, bound by the time and the myriad ways in which \"change\" imprint upon and alter the minds and behaviors of various players, both major and bit. Some Do Not... stands by itself and can easily be read alone as a great novel. It does, nevertheless, whet the appetite for more and is thus a perfect start to what I expect to be a sweeping, thrilling, and, naturally, bittersweet Tietjens saga."}, {"userName": "Grady Ormsby", "userReviewDate": "Aug 31, 2013", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/2784348-grady-ormsby", "userReview": "Some Do Not... is the first novel in Ford Madox Ford's classic Modernist tetralogy  Parade's End. Some people have compared this work to Downton Abbey. The setting for both is early Nineteenth Century England and the main characters for both are aristocrats, but the comparison stops there. Ford's work is no plot-driven soap opera. In fact, there doesn't seem to be much plot. On the face of it the characters don't do anything extraordinary and nothing out of the ordinary seems to happen to them. The \"action\" is interior and so is actually rather passive. Much of what would ordinarily pass as dialogue is actually monologue with many passages beginning with, \"he said to himself,...\" Many of these utterances are a stream-of-consciousness cascade of chopped-up phrases and contradictory idea bits that imitate the swirl of our own thought processes. From this we get richly developed characters will all the emotion, doubt, hope and fear we ourselves experience. Some Do Not... is not easy reading. One must proceed slowly and carefully in order to savor the richness of the language and the depth and complexity of thinking. I also found myself to be frustrated at first. It seemed to be impossible to relate to any of the characters. Slowly I began to realize that though the behavior, values and aspirations of the characters were foreign to me, the central matters of the human condition are universal. The conflicts that the characters face are those we all face. The struggle to know oneself and understand the mysteries of being transcend the coincidences of time, place and social status.

There is something very elegant about the melancholy that lines a silent, unattainable love, an elegance that is very much present in Ford's writing. I recommend the books especially to those who saw and liked the adaptation. There is significant depth to the characters and reworking their psychological details is beyond the scope of a film series, therefore the books are essential to get the full picture. Ford's narrative flows back and forth in time and very smoothly at that. The way he recounts his dialogue, though, is slightly weird and seems mechanical but one gets used to it.

I am glad I read it out loud as slowing down helped with the chronology (which really confused the storyline for me the first time through.)It was really interesting to see the characters through each other's eyes. A thank you to my daughter's Benedict Cumberbatch (AKA British-actor Silly-name; Bandersnatch Cummerbund) infatuation for introducing me to this book. Lovely Quote \" That was what a young woman was for. You seduced a young woman in order to be able to finish your talks with her. You could not do that without living with her. You could not live with her without seducing her; but that was the by-product. The point is that you can't otherwise talk. You can't finish talks at street corners; in museums; even in drawing rooms. You mayn't be in the mood when she is in the mood - for the intimate conversation that means the final communion of you souls. You have to wait together - for a week, for a year, for a lifetime before the final intimate conversation may be attained . . .\"sigh"}, {"userName": "Rene", "userReviewDate": "Sep 15, 2013", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/5664962-rene", "userReview": "\"Some do not ...\" is the first book of the tetralogy \"Parade\u00b4s End\". The tetralogy is set before and during the first World War. It is a part of the story of Christopher Tietjens (will the rest follow in the other books of the tetralogy?), who is unhappily married to an unfaithful wife. Although he loves another women, and she loves him, it does not come to a close relationship. The author unfolds the story in an interesting way, although this asks some extra concentration and patience of the reader. In the first place the story is not told chronologically, but the events are further filled in in later chapters, by flashbacks in the thoughts of the characters. I found this an interesting aspect of the book. The main part of the book is the giving of psychological background of the (relatively few) events that make the story. Often the characters say different things than they think. Anyway, a cleverly written book, worth reading."}, {"userName": "Dianna", "userReviewDate": "Mar 07, 2015", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/7186450-dianna", "userReview": "One down, three to go. I absolutely adored the mini-series, so my parents bought me these beautiful copies of Parade's End for my birthday. So months later I've finally started.And it was good! It was a little hard to get through at times. And the description of Tietjens is really not that of a romantic hero...which is actually kinda awesome. Tietjens is this sort of weird character who doesn't really fit into the world he lives in. And I just love how much he struggles with that. The people around him for the most part aren't that nice.And then Valentine comes along and they have this funny love story where they literally have like 3 conversations across all these years...and yet they're crazy about each other. Which is sorta sweet.But yeah. In sum: pretty good. I can't remember much of what happened next in the TV show...which is probably a good thing really."}, {"userName": "Frau Bl\u00fccher", "userReviewDate": "Aug 04, 2012", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/8549114-frau-bl-cher", "userReview": "Ein Stern Abzug f\u00fcr die \u00dcbersetzung von 2003, die in ihrem \u00dcbereifer f\u00fcr den zeitlich \"passenden Ton\" pl\u00fcschiger daherkommt als das englische Original.

I can already tell I'm going to be rereading this series at some point, which I certainly hadn't expected.

I want everyone to know of its genius. The way the novel envelops you; reminds you of your own love. The novel cleverly creates an empathetic reader, and we want the rose-red days of love to live on forever. Tietjens is a man of great intellect, and his knowledge translates into a great criticism of Edwardian England. Richly engaged and tied to every corner of the world, England seems isolated, but this text reminds the reader the far-reaches of England's Empire and the biting nature of a gossip-ready bureaucratic class.

Not an easy read, but it didnt take long to get drawn in to this story that could almost be boiled down to a traditionl love triangle, but one complicated by a looming World War I, the rigidity of the English upper crust, and a largely non-linear narrative bouncing in and out of the heads of various characters.

It isn't a light read nor is the protagonist, Christopher Tietjens, an easy conduit for modern readers, but he is a true Hero in the best sense of the word. A man who lives by moral and intellectual codes that may seem absurd to others but by which he abides in spite of great hardship to himself, such as sacrificing a great love so as to not shame (by divorcing her) a woman who has cuckolded him & even placed in doubt the paternity of their child.

The book is really a series and is very long. Because of the length, the intense use of description, and the approach to story telling, it took me quite a long time to finish. It was worth it, though. I'm embarrassed to say that I had no idea of the importance of Ford Maddox Ford. Most enjoyable to me was the language in the book.
