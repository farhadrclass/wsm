To give one's life for the cause is nothing. But to have one's illusions destroyed - that is really almost more than one can bear.\u201d \nJoseph ConradRazumov is serious about his studies. He is quiet, and like most men who brood, there is attributed to him by the people he knows a depth of wisdom that isn\u2019t due to his eloquent conversations or his grand standing on theories, but simply attributed to him because he doesn\u2019t say enough to dispel the illusion. Razumov seems like a man who is stewing about the state of affairs, and might be hatching a scheme to do something seditious. He is, needless to say, lonely. \u201dWho knows what true loneliness is--not the conventional word but the naked terror? To the lonely themselves it wears a mask. The most miserable outcast hugs some memory or some illusion. Now and then a fatal conjunction of events may lift the veil for an instant. For an instant only. No human being could bear a steady view of moral solitude without going mad.\u201dRazumov returns to his rooms one day, from the turmoil of the streets inspired by the successful assassination of a politician, to find the assassin lying on his bed waiting for him to come home. Joseph Conrad based this incident off of the real life assassination of Vyacheslav von Plehve.\nVyacheslav von Plehve, Minister of the InteriorYes, this mere acquaintance has decided out of all the people in St. Petersburg that he has to come to Razumov for sanctuary. Haldin asks for his assistance, and after debating the matter thoroughly with himself, Razumov agrees to help. It all goes wrong. Razumov flips out. He realizes that he is on the verge of being completely compromised by his association with Haldin. He goes to the police and reveals all. All he wants to do is go back to being a student, but he soon learns that his friends, really more like acquaintances, are now looking to him for leadership. Haldin had told their circle of friends that Razumov was a man they could count on. A friend named Kostia insists that Razumov must use him in his next plans.\u201dWhat was his life worth? Insignificant, no good to anyone; a mere festivity. It would end some fine day in his getting his skull split with a champagne bottle in a drunken brawl. At such times, too, when men were sacrificing themselves to ideas. But he could never get any ideas into his head. His head wasn\u2019t worth anything better than to be split by a champagne bottle.\u201dThe police have further uses for Razumov. He suddenly finds himself trapped into being this person he never intended to be. Mr. Razumov looked at it, I suppose, as a man looks at himself in a mirror, with wonder, perhaps with anguish, with anger or despair. Yes, as a threatened man may look fearfully at his own face in the glass, formulating to himself reassuring excuses for his appearance marked by the taint of some insidious hereditary disease.\u201dThe narrator of this story is an Englishman (also the source of the title) teaching English to the Russians in \u201cLittle Russia\u201d Geneva, Switzerland. He is telling this tale from notes in Razumov\u2019s journal, and through second and third hand information from various people who had some association with events. He also happens to be the tutor of Haldin\u2019s sister. He is, without any doubt, an unreliable narrator, and one can\u2019t help but think that Razumov is still being corkscrewed into a bottle with the wrong label. Our narrator does meet Razumov when Razumov is dispatched to Little Russia to interact with the revolutionaries.\nThe Meeting of The Unreliable Narrator and Razumov\u201dHe listened, without as much as moving his eyes the least little bit. He had to change his position when the beer came, and the instant draining of his glass revived him. He leaned back in his chair and, folded his arms across his chest, continued to stare at me squarely. It occurred to me that his clean-shaven, almost swarthy face was really of the very mobile sort, and that the absolute stillness of it was the acquired habit of a revolutionist, of a conspirator everlastingly on his guard against self-betrayal in a world of secret spies.\u201dIt is impossible to read this book without thinking about Raskolnikov from Dostoyevsky\u2019s novel Crime and Punishment. Both characters have completely gotten away with their moral dilemma; and yet, the burden of the guilt consumes their lives. Their crime is spread across their faces and everyone they meet, they feel, will be the one to finally reveal their guilt to the world. You could believe that this book was written as an ode to Crime and Punishment, but that would be a wrong assumption. Conrad did not think much of Dostoyevsky\u2019s writing style and was, in my opinion, trying to write a better book.\nThis book almost didn\u2019t see the light of day over a disagreement with his publisher. \u201dIn the summer of 1909 J. B. Pinker, dissatisfied with Conrad\u2019s failure to deliver the long-awaited manuscript, threatened to sever their business connection. In December they reached a crisis when Pinker refused to advance any more funds and the aristocratic Conrad, threatening to throw the manuscript into the fire, angrily exclaimed; \u2018 in a manner which is nothing short of contemptuous you seem to holding out a bribe--next week forsooth!--as though it were a bone to a dog to make him get up on his hind legs.\u2019\u201dThe relationship did not improve, but the manuscript was finally delivered in 1910. Andre Gide was a great admirer of this work. He supervised the translation of Conrad\u2019s works into French. \u201dOne does not know what deserves more admiration: the amazing subject, the fitting together, the boldness of so difficult an undertaking, the patience in the development of the story, the complete understanding and exhausting of the subject.\u201dPoor Razumov, a man content to read his books and puzzle out the keys to a myriad of philosophies. He is intelligent, and in some ways fits the profile of a revolutionary leader. Certainly the revolution that comes to Russia shortly after this book is published was lead by men similar to Razumov. The moment that Haldin decided to come to his rooms Razumov was faced with an impossible decision with two paths equally beset by guilt or damnation. Conrad uses the fickleness of fate to toy with the reader and show how little control we have of our own lives. It is nearly impossible to know what series of decisions needed to be made for Razumov to escape his self-condemnation. Highly recommended!

Taking place in St Petersburg and Geneva, Switzerland, the central character Razumov a student who aspires to become a member of the Russian civil service is roped into becoming a reluctant revolutionary by Haldin, who after completing the assassination of a minister, takes refuse with Razumov. But with having an association with the police he gives up Haldin for his good. Razumov is then recruited as a spy for the police and sent on a mission to Geneva to infiltrate the Russian community in exile there who are plotting against the system in Russia. He does so and but falls victim to love, with that of Haldin's sister. From here things would escalate into darker territory, where the actions of man's strengths and weaknesses are explored in great detail. The overall plot allows several themes and ideas to be developed, where one's true self and that of an internal imposter brings this period in time vividly to life. The central character of Razumov is exceptionally drawn, put under the microscope and the great emotional strain of the situation he finds himself in, his misanthropy nature leaves him out in the cold with no one to turn to, a lost sheep surrounded by hungry wolves and tormented to the core. It would be love that sees his world start to disintegrate, and a confession would lead to a course of action that would change his life forever.Joseph Conrad exercises a remarkable prescience about the nature of revolution and revolutionaries, and the revolutionaries here are the most grotesque and evil I have come across, there is a heavy menace that takes hold the further we progress through the novel, in particular a fellow by the name of Nikita, who could quite easily be the son of Satan. The metaphysical aspect of the novel is deepened and refined by Conrad's use of creepy Gothic resonance to the text, and even draws comparisons with writings of the Occult, bringing a depth to the narrative that works well. The fact there is actually a narrator who presides over events makes the whole reading far more multi-layered and is distinguished by the way Conrad handles the subject matter. With a masterly and commanding authority."}, {"userName": "Lyn", "userReviewDate": "Dec 10, 2011", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/5253785-lyn", "userReview": "Conrad's books always seem to start slow as he methodically creates a solid foundation and base of characterization. This one very much so and yet stays minimalistic and obscure throughout. Under Western Eyes, first published in 1911, had moments of greatness and had many very observant quotes about the Russian character, and Conrad brilliantly creates a mood of introspection and almost surreal soul-searching, but I just could not stay with it. One of the very few of his works that I just did not get. I may try it again down the road. I liked The Secret Agent so much more."}, {"userName": "Darwin8u", "userReviewDate": "Mar 06, 2011", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/2294090-darwin8u", "userReview": "\"The belief in a super natural sources of evil is not necessary. Men alone are quite capable of every wickedness.\"-- Joseph Conrad, Under Western EyesI'm beginning to think there are absolutely no whimsical novels written about the period between Bloody Sunday and the Russian Revolution of 1917. Written in 1911, Conrad's 'Under Western Eyes' is a lot of things: It is his response to the revolutionary fervor in Russia and Eastern Europe. It was a response to Dostoevsky's novel 'Crime and Punishment', and if previous scholarly works are to be believed, it may have also been a response to his own father who was a famous Russian revolutionary. Lastly, it was a response to the way the West viewed all of these things; the way the West couldn't fully grasp the depth of Russian despair and the innate conflicts within Russian ideals and Russian movements. It isn't my favorite Conrad, but it definitely belongs in the pantheon of Conrad's great novels. It is a novel without heroes but with amazing heroism. Conrad is able to tap into the emotional currents of several unique groups of Russians during one of its most fascinating times. Anyone interested in the Russian Revolution and the period right near its inception should not skip this book."}, {"userName": "Sketchbook", "userReviewDate": "Dec 29, 2010", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/4708498-sketchbook", "userReview": "Conrad's gripping espionager influenced Graham Greene,Maugham and LeCarre.

An unreliable narrator intimate with so many details, supposedly due to a diary, & yet unable to truly understand the Russian mind. \"Words are the enemy of reality.\" Truly.I liked a lot of Conrad's thoughts, depressing as they were. There is a dark incisiveness to them, but as good as they were individually, I found the whole unconvincing & melodramatic. What impressed me the most were the incredible similarities between Russia under the Czar & under Communism. Razumov's entire way of thinking from 'Mother Russia, the only family he's known' to his paranoid interviews with the police, intercession of a high 'party' official, & his subsequent use as a spy could all have come from a Solzhenitsyn novel. Weird - the more things change, the more they stay the same. It must be in the character of the society to manage to shape such disparate governing systems into a twin. That lends a lot more weight to the title. As much food for thought as this provides, it's often boring as hell. Right at the beginning he makes a point of the Russian's love of words, but they have nothing on him. This could have played out with half the words & been twice as impressive. I'm tempted to give it 2 stars, but will bump it to 3. Geoffrey Howard did a great job reading it."}, {"userName": "Mike", "userReviewDate": "Nov 23, 2016", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/7272380-mike", "userReview": "Published in 1911, Conrad\u2019s Russia novel (or so I\u2019ve decided to call it) seems to predict the Bolshevik Revolution. It begins with a young student of philosophy, Razumov, who returns to his flat one night to find a classmate, Victor Haldin, standing in his kitchen- or rather, in Conradian fashion, with an English narrator relating Razumov\u2019s story, pieced together from Razumov\u2019s diary and a few encounters with the man. Haldin, it turns out, has just assassinated a high-ranking Russian official, the repressive Minister of State, Mr. de P ---- (read: Vyacheslav von Plehve); Haldin and an accomplice lobbed bombs at de P ----\u2018s carriage from the side of a road. A few innocent bystanders, we\u2019re told, were also killed. Haldin wants Razumov to help him organize his escape; they are not close friends, in fact they barely know each other, but Haldin, having noticed Razumov listening quietly to the other students\u2019 discussions about the injustice of the Tsar and the autocracy, has inferred that Razumov shares his, Haldin\u2019s, convictions. There is something a little unbelievable about this, especially when we learn how many sympathetic associates Haldin had; why not go to one of them? Furthermore, his entirely improvised getaway seems inconsistent with the meticulously planned assassination. But setting that aside, Haldin has inferred wrongly; Razumov, after searching his conscience (although who can with absolute certainty distinguish in one\u2019s self moral choice from the fear of punishment?), makes the decision to go to the police. \u201cRazum\u201d, or \u201c\u0440\u0430\u0437\u0443\u043c\u201d, in Russian means \u201cmind\u201d, but Conrad renders Razumov\u2019s decision almost as a darkly religious experience, particular to Russians: In Russia, the land of spectral ideas and disembodied aspirations, many brave minds have turned away at last from the vain and endless conflict to the one great historical fact of the land. They turned to autocracy for the peace of their patriotic conscience as a weary unbeliever, touched by grace, turns to the faith of his fathers for the blessing of spiritual rest. Like other Russians before him, Razumov\u2026felt the touch of grace upon his forehead.Haldin is promptly arrested and hanged without trial. But the reader comes to understand what Razumov, consciously or not, knows immediately; from the moment Haldin appeared in his apartment, his life as he understood it was over. Sheltering Haldin would have drawn him into revolutionary activity, and he\u2019d likely have shared the same fate. But reporting to the authorities, while simultaneously receiving the confidences of Haldin\u2019s friends and associates (who, after Haldin\u2019s execution, believe Razumov to be one of them), also places Razumov under the authorities\u2019 suspicion- and insures that he will serve as their well-placed vassal. Soon enough he travels to Geneva, although it\u2019s not clear whether he is acting as that vassal or as the person Haldin believed him to be. He meets a small group of Russian political exiles living in \u201clittle Russia\u201d- the group is led by a Madame Blavatsky-like pseudo-occultist named Eleanora Maximovna de S---- and Peter Ivanovitch, the latter supposedly a great author and brilliant revolutionary. Razumov also meets Haldin\u2019s young sister, Natalia, who is straight out of Dostoevsky: young, beautiful, intelligent, stoic, she believes Razumov is a trusted friend of her brother\u2019s, the last to see him alive, and is the one character in the novel who seems to suggest hope for Russia\u2019s future. \u201cI believe that the future will be merciful to us all\u201d, she tells Razumov. \u201cRevolutionist and reactionary, victim and executioner, betrayer and betrayed, they shall all be pitied together when the light breaks on our dark sky at last.\u201d\u00a0The novel is prescient, but prescience often seems to involve just paying a reasonable amount of attention in the present. It probably would\u2019ve been hard for Conrad not to: he was writing after the failed revolution of 1905 and during the social unrest that followed. Furthermore, both of his Polish parents, when he was a child, were persecuted by the Tsarist authorities for dissidence. It's probably safe to say that he never became too unfamiliar with events in Russia; and one of the main themes of the novel is the way autocracy affects ordinary people, perhaps like his parents, and forces them into moral conflict. \u201cWhenever two Russians come together\u201d, the English narrator (who nevertheless, we\u2019re told, spent a few early years of his life in St. Petersburg, and is therefore, like Conrad, someone familiar with both the west and the east) says, \u201cthe shadow of autocracy is with them, tinging their thoughts, their views, their most intimate feelings, their private life, their public utterances- haunting the secret of their silences.\u201d But if the autocracy is unjust, the revolutionaries as Conrad depicts them are grotesque and sadistic, tyrannical in their dealings with others; they\u2019re as fit to be heads of government as Colonel Kurtz. So what\u2019s the correct form of government? Well, that\u2019s not Conrad\u2019s job- he had a tragic view of life, and it seems to me in line with the sentiment expressed in his earlier novel,\u00a0Nostromo: things may not be great, but revolution doesn\u2019t really fix anything, and it might make things worse. As the narrator says, ...in a real revolution the best characters do not come to the front. A violent revolution falls into the hands of narrow-minded fanatics and of tyrannical hypocrites at first...such are the chiefs and the leaders. The scrupulous and the just, the noble, humane, and devoted natures...may begin a movement- but it passes away from them. They are not the leaders of a revolution. They are its victims...The book\u2019s introduction calls\u00a0Under Western Eyes\u00a0a \u201cresponse\u201d to Dostoevsky\u2019s\u00a0Crime and Punishment. It\u2019s true that there are aspects of the book that seem like a satire and homage to\u00a0Crime and Punishment\u00a0and Dostoevsky in general- the main character\u2019s name, the insouciance of language and emotion, the unlikely meetings and coincidences, the beautiful and suffering Russian woman who helps the main character find a form of redemption, the themes of political dissidence and revolution (Dostoevsky was once a young revolutionary as well, and nearly died for it), and even the strange quality (intentional, I'll claim, having read enough of Conrad now to see how he varied his style from book to book) that it seems to have been translated from Russian.\u00a0Conrad is far from the first to suggest autocracy as a defining aspect of Russian life, and many have invoked it in a positive light. Count Sergei Uvarov, for example, in the early 19th century, proposed three pillars of Russian identity: autocracy, Orthodoxy and nationality. In\u00a0Crime and Punishment, Raskolnikov ultimately succumbs to his conscience and the beneficence of Orthodoxy; he vanquishes in himself the western ideas that allowed him to believe he had the moral right to take a life. In\u00a0Under Western Eyes, the country\u2019s true religion, the presence that people carry with them even in \u201cthe secrets of their silences\u201d and eventually find peace in, is autocracy."}, {"userName": "aPriL does feral sometimes ", "userReviewDate": "Jan 13, 2011", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/3409532-april-does-feral-sometimes", "userReview": "The fact that the Westerner narrator is an uncomprehending observer (whose character's eyes are in the title 'Under Western Eyes') and that the Russian character of the story, Razumov, has the reputation as a great listener (strikingly so, pun intended) is told us, gentle reader, upfront by the author Joseph Conrad, made strongly explicit. It must mean something. Razumov is an unformed human being, which in the first chapter is spelled out both in the description of his face as well as his reactions in discussions -he is easily swayed. He is a third year philosophy (!?!) student who may lack intellectual power or trust in his own convictions, which might be the reason behind an unusual silent demeanor he affects in conversations; he is perhaps an uncomprehending listener. (In this silent listening he is unusual because apparently most Russians are observed to talk much like parrots.) Throughout the book people seem to be uncomprehending observers and listeners and speakers of disjointed words. The most uncomprehending is a drunken servant, beaten black and blue while passed out thus he has no idea of how it happened but that the Devil (father of lies!) must have done it, torments himself with misinformed ideas of what happened. Another servant, a woman acting as a secretary to a revolutionary, is doing the job but she feels unhappy. She is a very bad secretary because no one really notices who she really is. She herself had no idea that the job would make her so unhappy until she got the job and got to know the people she was working for. Back to Razumov, it is noted in the first pages many people think he is a strong personality because of his lack of speech. What is made clear to us, gentle reader, is he fears and respects authority and simply wants his college degree. Instead, the plot thickens when a group of revolutionary students mistake him for one of them. He is forced into choosing sides due to a fatal bombing by a student who then wants Razumov to hide him. Fear drives Razumov to turn the bomber over to the police, who then recruit him to be a spy. He reluctantly tries to spy, but he cannot rid himself of a strong distaste and disgust for it all. The expat Russians living in Geneva, where the action is taking place, believe him a hero and attempt to draw him into their plots against the czar. The sister of the bomber is desperate to hear of her brother's last moments from Razumov believing him to be her brother's friend. Her mother (Mother Russia?) sits in a room day after day dying slowly from incomprehension. The narrator, as a teacher of languages he comprehends many words; however he admits he can make no sense of how the Russians feel about things. In an interesting side note he finally understands more when he reads Razumov's diary; in other words, a book. While Conrad's book is about the conditions of the expat Russians he observed in Geneva which might represent the issues behind the Russian Revolution, I think since Conrad literally skims over those conditions with such a minimal use of words his real object was exposing why the Russians fail to politically organize as he saw it. The book is really a very sly, and harsh, condemnation of the Russian soul in not translating into effective self-help. 'Under Western Eyes' seems to follow the usual plot points of Dostoevsky's books but with a very different focus. Dostoevsky seems to explore the inevitability of personality over fate, along with the mores of culture and class over morality, of history over free will in shaping Russian soul and destiny. Conrad seems to be ascribing the inability of the Russian heart and mind to coalesce decisively into clear thoughtful words (philosophy) as the source of political failure. He also appears to be saying that that failure is fatally crippling to any action taken. I think Conrad is also making a point that the West finds the East difficult to understand due to lack of philosophical words we can comprehend which the West assumes is due to language differences, but Conrad seems to be saying the West can't understand the East because the East is incomprehensible to itself. Of course maybe I'm getting this all wrong but my musings allow me to feel Conrad is writing a clever book here."}, {"userName": "Vit Babenco", "userReviewDate": "May 01, 2014", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/19283284-vit-babenco", "userReview": "Joseph Conrad stood at the beginning of all modernistic literature of the twentieth century and he was one of the most sagacious writers of all times.Generally speaking Under Western Eyes is a modern Judas tale ostensibly based on the traitor's confessions.There are two sides of barricades:\u201cYou suppose that I am a terrorist, now \u2014 a destructor of what is, but consider that the true destroyers are they who destroy the spirit of progress and truth, not the avengers who merely kill the bodies of the persecutors of human dignity.

Here in the awfully civilized central European capitals we may find him unusually soap-operatic and slightly overdone. Or maybe it is so close to home for the writer, Polish and born in the Ukraine, that every last semi-loyalty must be analyzed and parsed into oblivion. It is fairly safe to say at this point that Conrad was looking to present his view of the opposite of pan-Russianism, whether red or white, or at least to point to the cracks in the foundation. In 1911 Russia and adjacent Europe were so wracked by revolutionary fervor and anarchist violence that the rather conservative author may have wanted to counter the onrush of history as he saw it. That the orphaned Conrad's father was a patriotic Pole who flaunted the authority of Russian hegemony, that it was an era when the world was on the brink, would both have been influential. There is so much here to have loved that it's hard to call it what it seems, though. The era; the scrubby, grandiose/atrocious views we get of the Russian capital of the Czars, contrasted with the sparkling miniature-utopia of Geneva, all tiny parks, promenades and arched bridges ... provide an atmosphere for a political spy tragedy that shouldn't have missed. It does miss, though, and there is some evidence that Conrad was looking to settle certain scores with his novel that set the whole project into the 'contrivance' category. But not right away. As often with Conrad, locale, character and exposition on-the-fly are frontloaded and forced into the narrative mix quite early in the story; much as a modern film will mesh those elements directly into the first few shots, rather than languish in establishing shots or chit-chat from minor characters to set the stage. We're in the midst of it, right away, rather than waiting for a staged introduction. And even the 'Narrator' here is something of a ploy, as he too will come to be a major player, very early in the second act.\nSpeech has been given to us for the purpose of concealing our thoughts...\nMy impression is that it is part of the plan that some details will get lost in the rush, perhaps just mislaid, and some uncertainties will continue further into the mix, as we reach the inner frames of the story. All the better to play when required, on inner storylines when and where the emphasis is needed, rather than as mere introduction. Often this works as a stunning reverberation in a Conrad novel, but sometimes not, as in Under Western Eyes. The risk is a bit like telling a restrained and methodical story of a woman eating an apple, and then reframing it by saying she is in the garden of eden, and named Eve. Even in ranting against the rebels, the author is bloodthirsty in his condemnation the empire. Even in looking to upset the mystic, pan-Slavic logic of revolution, Conrad wants to indict not the ideals but the weaknesses of the personality types to whom a broad revolution will appeal. And he has no shortage of strange characters to present. As usual with Conrad, we are immersed here within multiple frames of a narrative plan that rearranges, slightly, the stream of events we are to witness. Frames of various perspectives overlay the minimal action, while the emphasis is left to fall on the viewpoint, the spin, at any given point. Almost the entire novel is accomplished in terms of the \"walk & talk\", where much is described by characters exchanging their take on the proceedings, while walking through Geneva (much beloved of television copshow writers, who need these wordy strolls to further their under-budgeted plots). And here (as with Henry James, often enough) the broth is beautiful but the soup is overcooked.Having said that, there are interesting resonances at hand, in Conrad's tale of a self-doubting and panicky student fallen into the embrace of international intrigue. An excruciating sequence of agonized reversals draws our anti-hero along the path: miscalculation somehow leads to being spared by luck, which leads to overconfidence and self-regard that is not matched by character; horribly bad luck and self-loathing await, and the author is not kind to his central character. One of the scores Conrad wants to settle is surely with the ghost of Dostoevsky.

First published in 1911, it was a major influence on spy fiction of the second half of the 20th century, including John Le Carr\u00e9. Its main characters are involved to greater or lesser extent in Russian revolutionary politics of the later 19th century.Victor Haldin, having assassinated a Russian government minister, takes refuge in the rooms of a student, Razumov, whom he believes will be sympathetic and assist his escape. After agonising for a while,Razumov betrays him, leading to his death, only to fall under suspicion himself. Razumov agrees to spy on revolutionaries plotting in exile in Geneva, where Haldin's sister and mother are living. Some of the revolutionaries are grotesque; most are cold-blooded in their willingness to pursue violence to achieve their goals; and they fear Razumov himself is tortured by guilt and by the double life he is leading, and is at times near total mental breakdown. In the end in an attempt at redemption he is driven to confess his role in Haldin's death, and retribution follows.Like several of Conrad's major works, the novel has a narrative frame: it is related by an elderly English language teacher living in Geneva who has had Haldin's sister as one of his pupils, and who himself appears in key points of the main story. The teacher has been given a detailed diary kept by Razumov, and this is the basis of most of the narrative and the portrayal of Razumov's inner thoughts. His perception of the events described emphasises the - to an Englishman - strangeness of the Russian revolutionary society and of Razumov's own psychology: hence the title of the novel, 'Under Western Eyes'. Conrad's fiction often focuses on encounters with what, from a conventional English viewpoint of the late 19th century and the early 1900s, is an exotic, sometimes savage world, and in this novel it is Russian culture and politics of the period that is the exotic.In the background, but not overly emphasised (this is a novel, not a political tract), is the theme of what means should be used to pursue greater freedom and justice in an autocratic country with extremes of power, wealth and poverty.This is the most Dostoyevskyan of Conrad's novels, especially in its portrayal of guilt-racked Razumov. There are also anticipations of the atmosphere of Kafka's novels, especially in the world of suspicious officialdom in which Razumov finds himself because of his involvement with Haldin. The betrayal of Haldin, and Razumov's attempt to redeem himself at the risk of death through his final confession, are treated in a manner which foreshadows the several-decades-later fiction of French existentialists."}, {"userName": "Tristram", "userReviewDate": "Mar 08, 2013", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/18181298-tristram", "userReview": "\u201eIn Life, You See, There Is Not Much Choice. You Have Either to Rot or to Burn.\u201dAs depressing as this limitedness of choice may seem \u2013 however, that is exactly what life as such boils down to \u2013, what may be even more depressing is when the decision pounces upon you instead of being taken by you. In short, it is probably worse to be made to burn than to burn. So it happens to Kirylo Sidorovich Razumov, the tragic hero of Joseph Conrad\u2019s political novel Under Western Eyes (1911), who would rather have gone in for rotting in peace and quiet, but whom circumstances seem to predestine for burning.Razumov, the illegitimate son of a Russian nobleman, uses the scarce means provided for him in order to study philosophy, hoping to qualify for an appointment as a civil servant in tsarist Russia, thereby attaining the ultimate position this autocratic system would hold in store for him. He is well under way making his mark as an excellent student, but one night, fate crushes all his careful plans in the person of Victor Haldin, a fellow student of his and, as it soon turns out, the man who assassinated a high tsarist functionary some hours ago. Haldin, under the notion of a certain trustworthiness inherent in Razumov, has sought refuge in his fellow-student\u2019s apartment and asks him to help him flee from the country. Razumov, finding that Haldin\u2019s accomplice to help him leave Russia, is a carter, now inert with drunkenness, decides to turn Haldin in to the authorities because he does not want to become further entangled with these revolutionaries. However, once his name becomes known to the authorities in connection with the revolution, he cannot go back into his old life. Instead, he is browbeaten into agreeing to be sent to Geneva in order to spy on the revolutionary exiles\u2019 plans against tsarist Russia. There he very soon meets Victor Haldin\u2019s mother and daughter, who have no idea that Razumov is anything but a true friend and a sharer of Haldin\u2019s beliefs but the man who caused his execution.Under Western Eyes is the dark psychological tale of a young man who is neither void of egoism nor completely base and unfeeling. In fact, Conrad took great pains to retain a sense of moral ambiguity, avoiding taking sides for or against Razumov. We are able to share the young man\u2019s sense of isolation due to his \u2013 as contemporaries would have it \u2013 ignoble origins, to understand his ambitions and his will to get on in life, and we may also understand his rejection of any form of partnership in Haldin\u2019s political course, however justified it might be in itself. Nevertheless, although the novel certainly presents Haldin in rather positive a light \u2013 there is an abundance of religious allusions \u2013, it still points out that the bomb thrown by Haldin also killed innocent bystanders. It is this sense of ambiguity that makes \u201cUnder Western Eyes\u201d such an intense experience, because, like Razumov, we find ourselves groping for light and a way out of the dilemma caused by the young man\u2019s act of betrayal.The tale is redolent of Dostoievsky\u2019s greatest psychological novels, in theme, but also to a certain degree in style, for Conrad has none of his marvelous descriptions of nature here and instead concentrates on the characters\u2019 inner lives. However, it also challenges one of Dostoievsky\u2019s most dearly-held views, namely that Russia could be healed from her ailments by returning to her Russian values and discarding Western influences. Conrad makes it quite clear, and he seems to be right in this, as is shown by a look at present-day Russia and the continuance of disregarding human rights, that autocracy is something inveterately Russian and that it is only by taking example from the West and its political culture that Russia can overcome the curse of oppression and iniquity. Significantly, the narrator of the story, an English teacher, who spent his childhood in Russia, is regularly at a loss when it comes to understanding the thoughts and values of the Russian exiles in Geneva, and he points out that no one who has grown up in England can really measure the deforming effects of autocracy on the human mind and soul. Conrad not only criticizes the amount of ideological exorbitance on the part of the autocrats, who even need no ideology in order to support their claim to power, but rely on the normative force of the factual. The narrator\u2019s major mock is one of the revolutionaries, a certain Peter Ivanovich, an enthusiastic utopian feminist, who nevertheless ruthlessly exploits the women around him in order to further his own interests, and who is a man whose self-righteousness definitely exceeds his intelligence.Summing up, I can highly recommend this novel as another instance of Joseph Conrad\u2019s power as a political writer."}, {"userName": "Paola", "userReviewDate": "May 19, 2014", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/8934711-paola", "userReview": "For me this was a book of two halves - as much as I enjoyed the first two parts, I found myself plodding through the second two. Perhaps it is just that this novel has not aged well: the world is much closer, and the whole premise of western eyes contemplating the inscrutable Russian society applies surely much less, if at all, to the sensibility of any contemporary Western European. In addition, many of the sex stereotypes, though well meant, sound quite tired. The third part, in which Razumov is employed as double agent in Geneva and crumbles under the pressure of Miss Haldin's trustful eyes, was the less palatable, the characters too grotesque, the dialogues too disjointed to draw me into the novel. Razumov himself, however, is a great character, and Conrad's instrument to argue for the pros and mostly the cons of upheavals and revolutions, of the naivete of those who are its instruments and end up crushed by the unstoppable wave they've helped push forward. I wish Conrad had stopped at Razumov's exit followed by NN and his henchmen, leaving a doubt as to his end, too forced and symbolic for my taste. Overall, an interesting read."}, {"userName": "Kim", "userReviewDate": "Oct 11, 2017", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/18948588-kim", "userReview": "Under Western Eyes is a novel by Joseph Conrad published in 1911. The novel takes place in St. Petersburg, Russia, and Geneva, Switzerland, and is viewed as Conrad's response to the themes explored in Crime and Punishment; Conrad was reputed to have detested Dostoevsky. That is the first thing I ever read about the book, well besides the title and author name on the cover. I, of course, had to go find out why Conrad despised Dostoevsky, who I would have thought, if I didn't know better, wrote Under Western Eyes. Here is what I found:I have an idea that his real hatred for Dostoievsky was due to an appreciation of his power. It is on record that he once told Galsworthy that Dostoievsky was \"as deep as the sea\", and for Conrad it was the depth of an evil influence. Dostoievsky represented to him the ultimate forces of confusion and insanity arrayed against all that he valued in civilization. He did not despise him as one despises a nonentity, he hated him as one might hate Lucifer and the forces of darkness. Richard Curle (whoever that is)Dostoevsky he resented and rejected, but sharing many of his concerns, found the Russian novelist sufficiently absorbing to engage him in an ideological and artistic polemic.Ralph E. Matlaw (another person I have no idea who he is) claims that \"The patent similarity of two great novels, Crime and Punishment and Under Western Eyes, is unique in literature\". Although this may be an exaggeration, what is certain is that there is no other Conrad text that invites to be read, at least in part, as a polemical response to the work of another writer. And the simple:Conrad despised Russian writers as a rule, due to his parents' deaths at the hands of the Russian authorities, making an exception only for Ivan Turgenev.It doesn't seem very nice to despise all Russian writers for something done to his parents, why do they get all the blame? Did he hate all Russian doctors too, or bakers, or, well, you know what I mean. Another thing I came across looking for the Conrad Dostoevsky link, had nothing to do with Dostoevsky, but my favorite author was mentioned:Joseph Conrad hasn\u2019t had it easy. Beloved by critics, read by millions of students, and lost in the middle. No other novelist has written so many recognized classics and still been so forgotten.Consider his offerings in my assembled version of the Western Canon. Conrad has six entries, one of which you\u2019ve probably read, many of which you\u2019ve heard of:Heart of Darkness  Lord Jim  Nostromo  The Secret Agent  Victory: An Island Tale  Under Western Eyes The only novelist who easily exceeds Conrad in universally-acclaimed output is that leviathan Charles Dickens with 12. Otherwise, no other celebrated literary heroes, from Henry James to William Faulkner, can outmatch him. I wonder which one of the six I've probably read. And then we have Vladimir Nabokov's opinion on both writers:Conrad, Joseph. A favorite between the ages of 8 and 14. Essentially a writer for very young people. Certainly inferior to Hemingway and Wells. Intolerable souvenir-shop style, romanticist clich\u00e9s. Nothing I would care to have written myself. In mentality and emotion, hopelessly juvenile. Romantic in the large sense. Slightly bogus.Dostoevsky, Fyodor. Dislike him. A cheap sensationalist, clumsy and vulgar. A prophet, a claptrap journalist and a slapdash comedian. Some of his scenes are extraordinarily amusing. Nobody takes his reactionary journalism seriously. \u25e6The Double. His best work, though an obvious and shameless imitation of Gogol's \"Nose.\"\u25e6The Brothers Karamazov. Dislike it intensely.\u25e6Crime and Punishment. Dislike it intensely. Ghastly rigmarole.I wonder what the guy had to say about other authors, if he liked anyone but himself. Ok, on to the book. We begin with meeting the narrator, an English teacher of languages living in Geneva, he is going to be narrating the personal record of Kyrilo Sidorovitch Razumov. He spends a little bit of time in the beginning telling us it isn't his story, he has no high gifts of imagination, he is just telling us the story, that kind of thing. He begins by telling us that Razumov is a third year student in philosophy (which sounds awful) at St. Petersburg University. Razumov wants only to study, he plans to win the silver medal;\"Razumov, going home, reflected that having repaired all the matters of the forthcoming examination, he could now devote his time to the subject of the prize essay. He hankered after the silver medal. The prize was offered by the Ministry of Education; the names of the competitors would be submitted to the Minister himself. The mere fact of trying would be considered meritorious in the higher quarters; and the possessor of the prize would have a claim to an administrative appointment of the better sort after he had taken his degree.\"The other students consider him an \"altogether trustworthy man\" who was liked for his \"quiet readiness to oblige his comrades even at the cost of personal inconvenience. He is the son of no one. Perhaps, one person, perhaps another, but he considers himself all alone, the son of Russia. He receives a modest but sufficient allowance from an obscure attorney, attends the obligatory lectures regularly and is considered a promising student. Also, he is always accessible and has nothing secret in his life. That's Razumov, or it was until he came home one day and found Victor Haldin, another student, in his room. It seems that there has been an attempt on the life of the Minister of State, he is said to be invested with extraordinary powers. He is described as a; \"fanatical, narrow-chested figure in gold-laced uniform, with a face of crumpled parchment, insipid, bespectacled eyes, and the cross of the Order of St. Procopius hung under the skinny throat.\"I'll have to go look up St. Procopius after this, I've never heard of him before. Anyway, Mr. Minister of State who's name I can't remember, is an awful man who serves the monarchy by \"imprisoning, exiling, or sending to the gallows men and women, young and old, with an equable, unwearied industry.\" Not a nice man at all, and now this attempt on his life has been made, and not only that it has succeeded, and not only that, the person who succeeded was now sitting in the rooms of Razumov. Haldin jumps right in by telling Razumov that it was him who murdered the Minister that day. As for Razumov;\"Razumov kept down a cry of dismay. The sentiment of his life being utterly ruined by this contact with such a crime expressed itself quaintly by a sort of half-derisive mental exclamation, \"There goes my silver medal!\"That's for sure. From this point on nothing good happens, not that I can think of anyway. People are either murdering each other, planning to murder each other, or just got murdered by one of the others. I felt long before this point that I had fallen into Dostoyevsky's Crime and Punishment. Nothing good ever happened in that book either. In fact, I can't think of a Russian book I've read that had any happy people in it. I should go back and re-read all my Russian authors carefully, looking for anyone who laughs, or even smiles. Smiles when they aren't about to kill someone else that is. But for now, Razumov goes out to find help in getting Haldin away, away from the scene of the crime, away from the city, and mostly away from his room. Remember, all he wants in life right now is a silver medal, but this is what he is thinking:\"The police would very soon find out all about him. They would set about discovering a conspiracy. Everybody Haldin had ever known would be in the greatest danger. Unguarded expressions, little facts in themselves innocent would be counted for crimes......Razumov saw himself shut up in a fortress, worried, badgered, perhaps ill-used. He saw himself-at best-leading a miserable existence under police supervision....\"So he goes forth to get help for Haldin. Haldin doesn't get help. The revolution goes on and on. People keep hating each other. Oh, and Razumov doesn't get a silver medal. No one does."}, {"userName": "Peter", "userReviewDate": "Jul 11, 2012", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/5958401-peter", "userReview": "I'll start with 2 questions;Why, I wonder, isn't this novel better known or more widely acclaimed? It shows moments of insight into the beginnings of World War I as well as the nature and outcome of the 2nd, and successful, Russian revolution. All the more remarkable then, is that being published in 1911, it pre-dates both of those two momentous events. Secondly, how to write a review that shows the novels worth without giving it away so as to spoil it for others?Well, for starters if you like Dostoevsky or Tolstoy, or already like Josef Conrad's other novels then there's a good chance that you are going to like this. Using the socio political climate of early C20th Russia as a background context obviously lends a flavour to this novel similar to some of those by Dostoevsky or Tolstoy; they are literary kin. This novel IS complex. In the first instance, precisely because of the differing expressions of it's characters; the central triad being the most humane and well created. They are bought into focus by the vaguely nightmarish or etiolated caricatures that surround them, both in Russia and in exile. These secondary characters reminded me quite strongly of those in G.K. Chesterton's spiritual conspiracy fantasy 'The Man Who was Thursday'. Secondly, whilst Mr. Conrad also conjures similar atmospheres to Dostoevski; inner mental tension, social squalor and a sense of human suffering and so forth, unlike Dostoevski, any questions that this poses are asked as an outsider looking in, namely 'The Westerner' grappling with the eastern European mindset, whilst simultaneously and more akin to Tolstoi or Dostoevski, (I'm thinking of 'Notes from Underground' or Levin in 'Anna Kerinina') there is also the 'Russian' outsider coming to terms with his own historical legacy. Any conclusions reached are therefore bound, to some degree, to be a little wide of the mark since all interpretations written within the text are by definition only incomplete (There is a kind of post modern inner dialogue throughout in which the narrator questions and discusses his own validity in such a role, and Razumov likewise doubts and questions pretty much everything). Nathalia Haldin is the one exception of the the central three, in that her estrangement from events is attributed to innocence, inexperience and purity; a kind of mythical Russian womanhood. Conrad's writing is at times a little cumbersome and verbose in comparison to the two great Russians. Lastly, the use of a non linear four part plot chronology adds to the aforementioned complexity by inviting or even purposefully allowing a certain interpretation before decisive and relevant information is made known.As to the cast, the story is framed by the narration of an Englishman, whom I believe voices the opinions of the author: A \"teacher of languages\"; the first of three main characters and the 'western eyes' under which the novel's story unfolds. \" I cannot pretend to any understanding of these people and their baffling actions\" he excuses himself early on, yet proceeds to provide his opinions of Russians and their culture throughout his telling of the story...citing cynicism as the moral/spiritual state that 'informs' The Russian, be he statesman, revolutionist, or prophet. The novel's second central figure, an anti hero, is Kyrilo Sidorovitch Razumov, a gifted student, an angst ridden, existential outsider in the spirit of Camus or Kafka. He is a strong and yet simultaneously fragile character, easily knocked out of equilibrium by social events and many of his interactions. He is tortured by his own thoughts and emotions as he finds himself unwillingly 'chosen', drawn into a conspiratorial revolutionary underground that accentuates his standing as 'an outsider' and yet also at times centre's itself around and confirms him. We are invited to see him as victim but of what?, himself?, his inner world?, Russian Society? His lack of love and family? His themes are loneliness, redemption, displacement, estrangement, angst, anger and the struggle to be genuine and free. If that all sounds a little post modern (1911 remember!) then check this! As the central young man of the novel, he is, at one point attributed the protest that he is 'not a young man in a novel'! Bravo Mr Conrad!The third central character is Nathalia Haldin,a young woman with 'the most trustful eyes in the world', a Russian in exile related to Razumov by circumstance and events, as what exactly? conspiracy? fate? Providence? The main plot revolves around this triad. These three are caught up in circumstances not entirely of their making, but to which they willing contribute. In the midst of this, whilst 'The Russian', his political ways and his history are examined (or rather defamed by Conrad) the themes of belonging, redemption, fate, conscience and 'the efficacy of remorse' are explored.I'l be thinking and ruminating on this novel for a while and I'll certainly mark it it as one to re read."}, {"userName": "Felice Picano", "userReviewDate": "Sep 03, 2012", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/351464-felice-picano", "userReview": "The title refers to the setting/milieu for 4/5 of this great, all but unknown today, Joseph Conrad novel: i.e. Geneva, Switzerland, in 1907. There, Russian conspirators and Russian secret agents are all gathered to either infiltrate and bring down the repressive Tsarist government or infiltrate and bring to grief the conspirators movement. It's one of the ongoing great stupidities of how literature is taught in American universities that people will graduate with honors having read two of Conrad's dopiest and least characteristic stories: Heart of Darkness and The Secret Sharer, thereby missing most of his great writing, i.e the novels Nostromo, The Secret Agent, Victory, and especially Under Western Eyes. But no one since Conrad has done this subject or kind of story better--John LeCarre coming closest. A young Russian student in Moscow has his flat invaded by another student who has just assassinated the head of the secret police with a bomb and is hiding out. Drawn into the ridiculous situation, the student balks at the role he is being forced to play. He goes to his unacknowledged nobleman father and they meet with a dignitary who arranges for the killer to be captured while attempting to escape. Even though the government knows our student was on its side, still he is put under enough surveillance that his prospects for a career are ruined. We meet him six months later in Geneva among the Russian emigre community. The student is now deemed a Hero of the Revolution, despite his true role. He meets with a rich woman funding the revolt and her protege, who wishes to become what Lenin will eventually be. Also various hangers on, including a slob of an assassin who our hero figures out is a double agent. And the betrayed student's beautiful, intelligent sister and grieving mother. All try to draw the student into their plots and the sister into her life, forever. Their machinations and ideas and ideals are wonderfully done, and each character is gorgeously laid out and developed. I'm only amazed this story hasn't been turned into a play or film, as the inner and outer drama is intense and real.

revolution, and gives a psychological portrait of paranoia, suspicion, guilt and despair. The protagonist Razumov is very complex and Conrad forces readers to come to their own conclusions about his character and actions, as well as the reliability of the narrative. While the oft-compared Crime and Punishment\u2019s central conceit is an action the protagonist takes, this novel\u2019s is an action taken upon the protagonist.What really struck me about this novel is Conrad\u2019s prescient disdain for the results of true revolution, as he wrote this years before the successful Russian revolution:\u201c\u2026in a real revolution\u2014not a simple dynastic change or a mere reform of institutions\u2014in a real revolution the best characters do not come to the front. A violent revolution falls into the hands of narrow-minded fanatics and of tyrannical hypocrites at first. Afterwards comes the turn of all the pretentious intellectual failures of the time. Such are the chiefs and the leaders. You will notice that I have left out the mere rogues. The scrupulous and the just, the noble, humane, and devoted natures; the unselfish and the intelligent may begin a movement\u2014but it passes away from them. They are not the leaders of a revolution. They are its victims: the victims of disgust, of disenchantment\u2014often of remorse. Hopes grotesquely betrayed, ideals caricatured\u2014that is the definition of revolutionary success. There have been in every revolution hearts broken by such successes\u2026\u201d"}, {"userName": "Brendan Hodge", "userReviewDate": "May 05, 2013", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/4814824-brendan-hodge", "userReview": "Re-Read: I re-read this as a sort of atmospheric background reading for the novel section I was writing at the time, and enjoyed it as much as the first time. -----------------I hadn't realized, until a friend recommended this book, that Conrad had written any books that weren't set \"in the colonies\". Come that that, I hadn't realized that he was Polish, which, given that Poland had been divided between Russia and Austria-Hungary meant that he grew up under Russian rule. (His father was an agitator for Polish independence and so part of Conrad's youth was spent in Tsarist political prisons.)Under Western Eyes deals with a Russian student, Razumov, who finds himself suddenly plunged into moral and ideological dilemmas when another student he barely knows appears in his rooms and announces that he has just assassinated a government official and is relying on Razumov to hide him and help him escape. The novel plays out at two levels: At the political level it deals with the corrosive effects both of tyranny and of revolution. At the personal, with conflicting desires and loyalties. The story is narrated by an Englishman, a second-hand witness to events, and it is through his Western eyes (from which the title derives) that we hear about events. This helps a great deal as a device since part of what Conrad is trying to do is convey how different Russian problems are from the problems which his English speaking readers are used to -- that Russian authority is not like other authority and that Russian revolution is not like other revolution."}, {"userName": "Libyrinths", "userReviewDate": "Jun 15, 2011", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/1875083-libyrinths", "userReview": "Writing before the Russian revolution, Conrad tries to elucidate Russia for the western reader. As such, you get some revolutionaries and bureaucrats, and a protagonist caught in between.The strength of the book is what Conrad's strength often is, his ability to see into the hearts and minds of characters. In this case he is aiming to see into the psychology of Russia as a country, and hits a few bull's eyes. I think the characters suffer a bit from it, but in some ways it makes his points more clear. While I had passing reminders of Dostoevsky, Conrad doesn't write with the intensity of Dostoevsky, and he's far easier to read. The characters themselves almost feel western compared to those in Dostoevsky. Yet, Conrad gets some points across. Such as the mindset of people in a country who have never known anything but autocracy and a corrupt bureaucracy. The inevitability, in a sense, of what happens to the main character.I found the ending somewhat unrealistic, but again, Conrad isn't Dostoevsky, and had a different purpose in writing. Conrad is one of my favorite writers, so I enjoyed the book. I wouldn't consider it at the top of my list of his books, but it is by no means at the bottom either. Some say it's his masterpiece, but I disagree with them on that. Still, it's quite good and an interesting read."}, {"userName": "Marian Allen", "userReviewDate": "Nov 16, 2013", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/3314240-marian-allen", "userReview": "I need another shelf called, \"I'm still thinking about it.\" It struck me as, \"What if Dostoevsky and Henry James got married and had a baby and named it CRIME AND PUNISHMENT UNDER WESTERN EYES?\" I'm still uncertain whether this book is an exploration of individual characters; an allegory of \"oppressive autocracy\", \"indifferent democracy\", and \"fanatical revolutionism\"; a paean to the power of Woman, or what.

Extraordinary .The novel is a fine psychological drama however ; it turns on the principle character Razumov\u2019s dilemma when finding himself unwittingly exposed to the author of an assassination who turns to him for help. Whichever way R turns he is going to be in some kind of trouble. This is after all Russia and the novel deals with the psychology of living in Russia. Who does he turn to ? How can he resume his studies and his innocent life ? Answer - he can\u2019t. There are some satisfying moral pointers and symmetry. For example, the moment of R\u2019s being safe is the moment he decides he must tell all and renounce his life , satisfying because it is entirely credible . For being safe would lead him towards still greater corruption - a love affair with Haldins sister, the devastating of her goodness and innocence. And knowing this drives him to tell all - so again, CONRAD seems to be expressing faith in R\u2019s redemption . And that feels like the author has faith in mankind itself . It is kind of uplifting for the reader.There are other aspects to UWE which distinguish it as from Leavis Great Tradition of authors. CONRAD is the first author ( after Austin Eliot James ) for whom the novel is NOT a comedy of manners. Whereas the narrator and Miss Haldin maintain a fairly English degree of civility in their dealings, Razumov is so worn through by his inner psychological conflict that his manners and social interaction are more \u201cOne flew over the cuckoos nest\u201d than \u201cpride and prejudice \u201c or \u201cportrait of a lady\u201d. CONRAD is similar to Dostoevsky in the way that the irascible workings of the mind play havoc with social interaction and in many places this is good comedy of the absurd. CONRAD is a wonderful author. There are no airs and graces. He benefits from not being English , to my mind , as an author and he is a compete breath of fresh air after Henry James ( whom I enjoy but in a very different way) although they are writing within a few years of each other"}, {"userName": "Richard Craven", "userReviewDate": "Dec 07, 2017", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/51751633-richard-craven", "userReview": "I view UWE as a valuable addition to what we might call remorse literature, most obviously in comparison to Crime & Punishment - in view of its Russian psycho-landscape, and prose style - but also in comparison to, for instance, Graham Greene's The Quiet American.For the purpose of comparison between the three works, an analysis of narratorial perspective and reliability is quite illuminating. In the case of C&P, as I remember from reading it many years ago (I hope and trust I'm getting this right!), although the narration is 3rd person, and the perspective is fairly closely identified with Raskolnikov, the student who takes it upon himself to murder the old female loanshark, nevertheless the narration is reliable. The reader does not get the feeling of stuff being withheld in the rendering of Raskolnikov's thought processes.In the case of the Quiet American, the - unreliable - narration is 1st person, from the perspective of jaded British journalist Thomas Fowler, living in Vietnam in the years before the French debacle at Dien Bien Phu. Fowler, appalled by the blitheness with which earnest CIA agent Pyle passes off his own culpability in the bombing of a Vietnamese market, arranges Pyle's murder with the Viet Cong. Fowler's justification for this act of altruistic revenge is compromised by the fact that Pyle has stolen his girlfriend. Nor does Fowler allude in the aftermath of Pyle's death to any remorse.In the case of UWE, the diligent foundling student Razumov returns from university to discover in his rooms Victor Haldin, fresh from assassinating the hated chief of the secret police. Razumov, who loathes revolution and revolutionaries, informs the authorities through the good offices of his mysterious sponsor Prince K, who is very likely to be his father. Haldin, having been duly arrested, tortured, and executed, Razumov is taken up by the serpentine spymaster Mikulin, and sent to spy on a coven of revolutionary gargoyles in Geneva, each of whom is singularly unprepossessing, much in the manner of the bomb-chuckers and ghastly communists excoriated in Conrad's other novel The Secret Agent. Much to his disgust, the gargoyles accept Razumov after some initial suspicions regarding Haldin's betrayal are allayed by the blaming of Ziemiatin, a drunken coachman who hanged himself shortly after Haldin's arrest. Such is Razumov's self-disgust, however, that he ends up betraying himself both to Haldin's sister, the irreproachable Natalia, and to a meeting of the gargoyles, where he is badly beaten. Following an accident with a tram which leaves him permanently crippled, he is taken in hand by Tekla, abandoning her servitude to two of the most disgusting communists.UWE is narrated by an unnamed elderly Englishman, Natalia's informal tutor and himself an artless scrupulous somewhat dull recorder, sifter, and editor of the truth, with the aid of Razumov's journal. This filtering device provides the reader with a mixed perspective. At times, the English tutor withdraws discretely into the background, and the narration proceeds very much directly from the perspective of Razumov; and at other times the tutor's voice comes to the fore."}, {"userName": "Bruce", "userReviewDate": "Sep 07, 2012", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/1207684-bruce", "userReview": "As with so many of Conrad\u2019s novels, this one begins with an anonymous narrator, an Englishman, describing how he came across a document from which he will tell the story. The primary plot involves the student Razumov who is interrupted at his lodgings while studying by Haldin, a bare acquaintance and political activitist who has just assassinated an official and seeks a hiding place until he can escape from St. Petersburg. Haldin sends Razumov out into the snow to seek transportation. Razumov, very unwilling to be involved in this situation in any way and resenting Haldin\u2019s imposition on him, first unsuccessfully tries to arrange for a sled and driver and then becomes ever more convinced that his best option to extricate himself from any involvement in this revolutionary episode is to turn Haldin in to the authorities. He goes first to \u201cThe Prince,\u201d a personage whom he has concluded is his anonymous benefactor, who in turn takes him to the General, a Javert-like figure who, half-suspecting Razumov of complicity, sets out a plan for apprehending Haldin. The atmosphere Conrad conjures suggests something from Dostoevsky; in particular, Razumov\u2019s turmoil of inner anguish reminds one of Roskolnikov. Events unroll as planned, Haldin is caught and executed, but Razumov\u2019s unrest continues as he remains under suspicion by the police. His relationship with the policeman Mikulin reminds me uncannily of Raskolnikov\u2019s relationship with Porfiry in Crime and Punishment, further strengthening the Dostoevsky parallels.Conrad then suddenly shifts gears, leaving Razumov temporarily behind. We are now in Geneva at a time before the narrator has seen Razumov\u2019s document and thus does not know the information already provided in the narrative. The narrator explains that he himself has made the acquaintance of Haldin\u2019s mother and sister in Geneva and was with them when they learned of Haldin\u2019s death, a terrible blow. Haldin\u2019s sister in particular determines to continue her brother\u2019s work, and, having learned through a Father Zosim (note the similarity to Dostoevsky\u2019s Father Zosima) in St. Petersburg of the arrival in Geneva of a friend of her brother, she intends to meet him and try to learn more about her brother\u2019s work and death. The \u201cfriend\u201d is, of course, Razumov himself, whom Haldin briefly mentioned in a letter to his mother, leading the mother and Miss Haldin \u2013 Natalia \u2013 to assume that the men were close friends and co-revolutionaries. When they do meet, Razumov is understandably stunned and disconcerted, whereas Miss Haldin greets him enthusiastically as the man whom she believes was her brother\u2019s best friend. Our narrator takes it upon himself to explain the whole situation to Razumov, who responds with understandable consternation and enigmatic comments. Part III returns to Razumov\u2019s narrative. Involved in the political issues is the strange and somewhat sinister figure of Peter Ivanovitch \u2013 the blue-spectacled \u201cgreat feminist\u201d and \u201csuper-revolutionary\u201d - a Russian expatriate in Geneva whose political leanings are far from clear and who seems to be making assumptions about Razumov\u2019s own inclinations and who apparently wants to enlist his cooperation in some movement or venture. This strange man introduces Razumov to the equally bizarre Madame de S___, an apparent clairvoyant mystic who aspires to encouraging revolution in the Balkans, hoping that this will trigger revolution in Russia itself. Shortly after this encounter Razumov meets Sophia Antonovna, a revolutionary leader who seems to know more about events in St. Petersburg on the night of Haldin\u2019s arrest than would seem likely, and her conversation suggests that she is toying with him as a cat with a mouse. Razumov feels that he has satisfactorily deflected suspicion from himself, but the reader senses a net closing in. The narrative to this point has raised several questions. Is Razumov in Geneva as a fugitive from Russian justice? Has he himself become a revolutionary, partly out of frustration that his chosen path in Russia has been destroyed, partly out of guilt for his betrayal of Haldin? That seems unlikely. Or is he there as a counter-revolutionary, intent on moving against the revolutionaries he finds in Geneva? In Part IV, the issue becomes clearer when we learn that Mikulin has used Razumov\u2019s anxieties and uncertainties to send him to Geneva in order to discover what is thought to be the forming of a new revolutionary plot. But was even this a subterfuge of Razumov? The narrative becomes more tangled before it is ultimately unraveled in a particularly fascinating way that I will not detail here.The persistent theme that runs through this narrative is the inscrutable nature of the Russian collective soul or mind, the uniqueness of the Russian spirit attuned intimately to its own history, the historical situation in Russia at the turn of the 19th and 20th centuries, and utterly incomprehensibly of the Russian psyche to Western understanding. What the West often perceives as a kind of gloomy and violent irrationality in Russia\u2019s very social fabric, and Russia\u2019s understanding of the nature of the individual in his relationship with the collective, if not illuminated is certainly vividly portrayed in this novel. Issues of guilt and expiation are those that haunt so much of Russian literature, and Conrad has fused these themes with his own fascination with psychological complexity and the ultimate unknowability of the human soul. Conrad himself was by origin a Russian Pole who, after a fascinating life sailing the world as a working sailor, ended up in England and wrote in English. He was critical of Dostoevsky\u2019s work and wrote this present work partly as a critique of revolutionary ideals and movements which he felt resulted in even more suffering on the part of the poor."}, {"userName": "Shane", "userReviewDate": "Apr 29, 2018", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/2837066-shane", "userReview": "Good story about a college student in Russia and his interactions with revolutionaries and the autocratic government.
