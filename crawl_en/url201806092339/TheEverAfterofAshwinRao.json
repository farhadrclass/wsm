All 329 passengers and crewmembers were killed. Of those dead, 268 were Canadians. Yet, this tragedy received little outrage in Canada \u2013 these dead may have been Canadians by birth or choice but the colour of their skin marked them as \u2018other\u2019. To too many Canadians, this was an Indian disaster, not a Canadian one \u2013 Brian Mulroney, then Prime Minister of Canada, phoned the Indian President to offer his condolences. It would be almost 20 years before suspects were finally brought to trial. Although, there were several suspects, only one man would ever be convicted and then only of manslaughter and perjury. Author Padma Viswanathan uses this lack of outrage by the larger Canadian population as well as the lack of closure for the victims as the backdrop for her novel, The Ever After of Ashwin Rao. Ashwin came to Canada in 1969 to study medicine and psychology. He settled into Canadian life with a growing practice and a Canadian girlfriend. However, when his father falls ill, he returns to India and accepts a job there. It is a period of political unrest in India. When Indira Gandhi is assassinated in 1984, Sikhs are blamed, leading to violence against them. As the violence spreads to their neighbourhood, Ashwin and his father hide some of their Sikh neigbours but witness the murder of two men at the end of their street. In 1985, Ashwin\u2019s sister plans a trip to India with her two children. Ashwin last speaks to her just as they prepare to leave to catch their flight on Air India Flight 182.As the 2004 trial of the suspects finally begins for the bombing, Ashwin returns to Canada to do a psychological study of the survivors and their grief. He decides to keep his own loss a secret as he conducts the interviews. The novel deals mainly with two families: Venkat, a university professor, whose wife and son died in the crash, although only his son\u2019s body was recovered and Seth, who worked with Venkat and whose family has taken responsibility to help Venkat as he slowly disappears into his grief. Ashwin\u2019s own story becomes entwined with theirs. The narrative shuffles back and forth from India to Canada as well as to Ireland and in time from before the bombings to the trials. It deals with the differences between Canadian-born Indians, those who immigrated to Canada, and those who remained in India in regards to issues like marriage, children, grief, and faith. It also contrasts the attitudes of other Canadians to the tragedy with the Irish who lived close to the crash site. Yet, despite the real disaster and its aftermath that are the background for this novel, this is neither a revenge story, a story of victimization, or a rejection of Canada despite its sorry attitude towards the crash and its victims or its tepid efforts to bring the guilty parties to justice. Viswanathan manages to give a nuanced look at what led to the tragedy as well as a very empathetic picture of how it affected survivors. Most surprising given everything that happened both in the reality of the disaster and in the novel, she provides a hopeful ending to the story. 4.5"}, {"userName": "Ben Babcock", "userReviewDate": "Jan 24, 2015", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/1188122-ben-babcock", "userReview": "I read, and greatly enjoyed, The Toss of a Lemon years ago. Now Padma Viswanathan is back, this time with a Giller Prize nomination, again with a book connected to India, but now one firmly grounded in Canada\u2019s history and conflicted mixture of cultural obligations as well. The Ever After of Ashwin Rao is every bit as complex and emotionally sensitive as one might expect from a literary award nominee. While it didn\u2019t quite engender the same lasting sense of enjoyment that I seem to recall The Toss of a Lemon creating, it still manages to be a marvellous work of fiction.Despite its title, I\u2019d argue that The Ever After of Ashwin Rao is not, actually, about Ashwin Rao. He is the nominal protagonist and the first-person narrator for most of the book. And, true, Viswanathan spends a lot of time developing him as a character: the events of the book affect him, and we seem him coming to terms with his own losses. But over time, the story of Seth\u2019s family overshadows Ashwin\u2019s own narrative. Viswanathan shares details he couldn\u2019t have access to\u2014though, I suppose, there is an argument to be made that all of these details are actually part of a narrative Ashwin wrote, as part of his narrative therapy procedure, and do not actually reflect what happened. How\u2019s that for an unreliable narrator?Regardless, my point is that this book is about so much more than a single man working through his grief. Viswanathan\u2019s careful creation of an Indian\u2013Canadian psychologist who is looking to create a book of interviews and stories about those grieving over the Air India Disaster, when he himself lost a sister and niece and nephew in the disaster, is clever and heartwrenching to equal degrees. She fixates upon one of the most prominent and tragic events in recent Canadian history, yet she manages to capture the most human elements and reactions to it. Although the trial of the alleged perpetrators is ongoing in the background, it never takes the forefront\u2014it is just setting, a way of establishing the atmosphere and tone in which Ashwin does his work.As humans (sorry, aliens and robots who are reading this in the far future when my reviews are the only remaining corpus of human writing), we all have some kind of experience with grief. We know that grief has strange, unforeseeable and lasting effects on individuals. We handle it in different ways. Some people gather their grief close to their chests, hoarding it as if the feeling alone can somehow compensate them for their loss; others want to share and open up and form new connections as compensation for ones they will never feel again. There is no right or wrong way to grieve, provided your grieving process is right and healthy for you.Ashwin isn\u2019t interested in the grieving process, however, so much as he is interested in the aftermath of that process. With twenty years passed since the disaster, he wants to know how well families have \u201cadjusted\u201d to what happened. The immediate feelings of grief are gone\u2014and what is left? This is the \u201cever after\u201d of the book\u2019s title: the harsh and inescapable truth that, when people die, we keep going. And like a ripple propagating forward through time after a time-traveller inadvertently steps on a butterfly, this grief has profound but subtle influences on the people it touches.For me, the highlight of this book is not so much any individual\u2019s portrayal as it is the way Viswanathan contrasts Indian and Canadian cultures. Ashwin, Seth, Venkat, and Lakshmi are all Indians who immigrated to Canada (though in Ashwin\u2019s case, he then moved back to India)\u2014they have a \u201cCanadian experience\u201d that has affected them, but they were essentially raised Indian. Seth and Lakshmi\u2019s daughters, on the other hand, are Canadian by birth, Indian by heritage. Their conceptual framework is quite different\u2014and they were so young when the disaster struck that their reactons differ in that respect as well. Viswanathan is sensitive to these differences in her characterization, making for a rich tapestry of human emotions and behaviours.Ashwin draws parallels between the Air India Disaster and the Golden Temple massacre in India, where Indian military forces stormed a Sikh temple that was under the control of resistance forces. This led to massive fallout: Gandhi\u2019s subsequent assassination at the hands of her Sikh bodyguards, and then mob-conducted pogroms against Sikh families in India to which the government and police turned a blind eye. Later in the book Ashwin continues to ruminate on the complicated, fragmented nature of Indian religious consciousness: how Britain divided its colonial possession along Hindu and Muslim lines, leaving the Sikhs out in the cold. Do the Sikhs \u201cdeserve\u201d or \u201cneed\u201d their own nation? Is it even right or reasonable to silo people by religious identity? Even though I am capable of comprehending and considering these questions from an abstract perspective, it\u2019s impossible for me to understand them in the context that a character like Ashwin, who grew up in India, does. I was reminded, once again, of how my own life and upbringing and privilege to live in a \u201cstable\u201d and \u201cboring\u201d place like Thunder Bay, Canada has influenced my perception of what the world is like.Of course, the Air India Disaster was not really an Indian disaster but a Canadian one, even if our government didn\u2019t seem to take that point at the time. The victims were, by and large, Canadians\u2014that they happened to be of Indian descent, on an Indian-owned airline, was beside the point. The perpetrators, too, were likely Canadian\u2014albeit influenced by Indian\u2013Sikh radical ideologies, sure. But as Viswanathan and my own Wikipedia-fuelled research indicate, it\u2019s not like CSIS and the RCMP were totally ignorant of potential threats. They just didn\u2019t act on them. Then, in the years that followed, a strange silence and reluctance to admit wrongdoing. Two decades before a trial.That idea that the Air India disaster was not the Canadian government\u2019s responsibility because the passengers were of Indian descent is the potent descendent of a much more overt and noxious colonialist streak that runs through our history. Viswanathan invokes the Komagata Maru incident, reminding us that Canada was very much \u201cfor white British subjects only\u201d well into its time as sovereign country. I don\u2019t know if it\u2019s because of or in spite of our stereotypical reputation for politeness and fairness that we don\u2019t want to talk about, acknowledge, or make amends towards those sorts of missteps in our past \u2026 despite our pretensions towards humility on the world stage, we are not so different from that country to our south (Canada\u2019s sweater), and the close ties we maintained with mother Britain occasionally meant we were worse. The fact that, in 1985, these people didn\u2019t receive better posthumous treatment because of their ethnicity and heritage speaks to the continued conflict within Canada about what it means to be Canadian, to be a citizen, to have \u201ca Canadian culture.\u201d That is a conflict that remains as-of-yet unresolved.This is probably why the book is so affecting, why it\u2019s so difficult to read despite being, on its surface, placid and perhaps even dull in its lack of events to punctuate its equilibrium. It evokes so many ideas, especially uncomfortable ones. I dragged my heels reading this\u2014it\u2019s a reasonable-length book, and I\u2019m reading one that is arguably longer now in about the space of two days\u2014but you need to take your time to let the feelings sink in.I said earlier I didn\u2019t enjoy this as much as Viswanathan\u2019s first novel. That shouldn\u2019t be taken as criticism of this one. Enjoyment probably isn\u2019t the most appropriate term for a book like this. And they are different types of stories: one is a sprawling, multi-generational look at changing attitudes, while the other is a more constrained attempt to chart the vicissitudes of grief. It\u2019s difficult to compare them or judge one against the other, so I don\u2019t want to try. Both are probably worth reading, if this sort of fiction\u2014Indian-Canadian, semi-historical, emotional and literary in tone and breadth\u2014is what you\u2019re in the mood for. It\u2019s heavy; I should have gone for a definitely-lighter book afterwards but seem to have ended up with a similarly moving title instead. Such is life.I don\u2019t want to go into spoiler territory discussing the twist or the denouement that follows. Suffice it to say, I\u2019m not sure I understand the impulse that led Viswanathan to do that\u2014but I understand the sentiment behind those closing pages. We spend so much of our life at the mercy of chance events, of others\u2019 actions, of unforeseen consequences that influence our own opportunities. There is an impulse in all of us to act, to move, which can either manifest itself as lashing out or as reaching out, depending on our emotional pique of the moment. Above all else, there is that fundamental and unshakeable truth: time marches on. We can\u2019t go back. We can\u2019t revisit loved ones long gone; we can\u2019t undo mistakes\u2014ours or others\u2019.Like Seth, heading along the beach and into the ocean, we have only one choice: do we walk or do we run into our future? Do we cower, or do we embrace it with open arms?"}, {"userName": "Ruth Seeley", "userReviewDate": "Aug 17, 2015", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/3303646-ruth-seeley", "userReview": "While occasionally preachily written (there are definitely expository passages I would have cut), this is an important and compelling novel about a tragedy we as Canadians have ignored, the bombing of Air India flight 182 in 1985. I'm not sure I agree with the author that systemic and endemic racism are the reasons no one has written a novel about this act of terrorism before now. There's never been a novel written about the Swiss Air crash in Peggy's Cove (admittedly not an act of terrorism). Nor has there been a novel written (to my knowledge) about the boatloads of Tamil refugees who arrived in Chester, Nova Scotia in 1987.The theme of psychological redemption through narrative reframing is a fascinating one and I plan to investigate it further. Meanwhile though, I'd highly recommend reading this novel. There are passages that will take your breath away. And they easily outweigh the clunky ones mentioned above."}, {"userName": "Krista", "userReviewDate": "Oct 03, 2014", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/4729639-krista", "userReview": "The Ever After of Ashwin Rao has a promising premise: On June 23, 1985, Sikh terrorists planted a bomb on Air India Flight 182, and while en route from Montreal to Delhi (via London), the plane exploded over Irish airspace, killing all aboard, including 268 Canadian citizens. As a percentage of our population, this was Canada's 9/11 moment, but it failed to provoke national mourning, and as Padma Viswanathan writes in this book, Canadians saw it as \"an act of brown-on-brown terrorism that a (nearly entirely) white government failed to prevent or even properly to investigate.\" As she reminds us, the Canadian Prime Minister at the time, Brian Mulroney, called the Indian Prime Minister to offer condolences -- as though this was their tragedy, not ours. Eighteen years later, as two suspects are finally being brought to trial, Ashwin Rao -- an Indian psychotherapist who was trained at McGill -- returns to Canada to interview the families of the Air India victims. Rao is a practitioner of Narrative Therapy:\nMy therapeutic interest is in framing individuals' maladies as stories within stories within stories, the way people themselves are nested within families and societies\u2026My challenge is to tell the story on the individual's terms, giving a nuanced sense of his problems' origins -- in himself, in his community, in societal expectations.\nWhat this means is that Rao is trained to listen to a person's discourse, and then with some practised intuition, can write the person's story out, adding all of the background and surroundings details that they might not realise are contributing to their current problems, and then he shares the fictionalised version, collaboratively tweaking details where necessary. With the start of the trial, Rao intends to write a book about the lives of the families of the Air India victims in the style of this Narrative Therapy; declining to share with his interview subjects the fact that he, too, lost family in the explosion; his sister and her two children.That's what the beginning of this book appears to be about -- and I was intrigued to learn more about the Air India bombing and thought the format would lend itself well to exposing the Indian-Canadian community's grief and outrage -- but after showing Rao interviewing his former brother-in-law, the therapist's account jumps to the town of Lohikarma, B.C., and becomes centered on one family that Rao encounters there (noted as the fourth town, seventh family, although we don't meet any of the others). Through his encounters with Dr. Sethuratnam (known as \"Seth\", a physics professor who reminds Rao of his own father) and his daughter Brinda (who reminds Rao of his dead niece), Rao is mindful of his own life story and \"the three lightning strikes\" that spared him (which are the three Indian-on-Indian tragedies that affected him without harming him). Most of the rest of the book alternates between the telling of Rao's biography and Seth's growing attachment to a guru (whom he thinks of as God-on-Earth), and it was never clear to me whether Seth's experiences were real or merely Rao's fictionalised imaginings as he performed Narrative Therapy on himself. If they were meant to be Seth's literal story, they took up a huge chunk of the book for uncertain purposes -- the character is even peripheral to the Air India tragedy -- but being a physics professor, he is able to introduce Heisenberg's Uncertainty Principle and multiverses to the Hindu worldview (a connection I always like to read about, but doesn't really move the story forward).As Rao looks at the big picture and tries to establish root causes for Sikh terrorism -- the Air India bombing was a response to anti-Sikh progroms in India, following the assassination of Indira Gandhi following the storming of the Golden Temple\u2026going back to the Punjab at the dawn of the sixteenth century -- he seems to be making the case that this was \"brown-on-brown terrorism\" that just happened to have been perpetrated from Canadian soil and that seemed to undermine any useful point this book could have been making. And as for the writing, there were some poetic passages, that while lovely, seemed out of place:\nOne upon a time -- here, I cannot be specific -- Hinduism arose, perhaps on the soil south of the Indus; perhaps brought by Northern invaders. Without Hinduism, there would not have been Sikhism. Without India, could there be Empire? Without Empire, could there be radicalizing? Without Canada, could there have been a bomb?Once upon a time: poetry, syncetism, mysticism, death.Once upon a time: evolution, matter, being.Once upon a time: time.\nAnd more than once, as Rao is telling his own life story, he'll say something like, \"Count on a therapist for a fancy prose style\" or apologises for \"yet another laboured metaphor\", and unless this is a reminder that Rao is a Narrative Therapist (and is meant to alert the reader to the semi-fictionalised nature of his methods) then it's unnecessarily self-conscious and distracting. And don't get me started on the surprise near the end -- talk about unnecessary.I know it's pointless to be disappointed when a book doesn't turn out to be what I was expecting, but this feels like such a lost opportunity. At least Viswanathan attracted the attention of the Giller Prize judges with this effort."}, {"userName": "Shirley Schwartz", "userReviewDate": "Jan 04, 2015", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/4278399-shirley-schwartz", "userReview": "I'm not sure how to rate this book, or even what to say about it. This was a Giller prize finalist last year, and it was the last of the six shortlisted books that I read. I found the book was extremely well-written, and Ms. Viswanathan is an author of some skill. But I found the book pretty hard slugging at times. There is a lot about East Indian religion that I found slowed down the book's pace considerably. The book is ostensibly about the surviving family members of the 1985 Air India plane crash. It certainly shows that home-grown terrorists and radicalized local terrorists are not a 21st century issue. They have been with us for some time. The book is certainly sad and heartrending, and often difficult to read since I'm afraid our Canadian government and CSIS, both past and present, don't come out looking very proactive. In fact, it doesn't appear that either took the bombing seriously when it occurred. Even though 329 people died in this bombing, no-one has ever been charged with the crime, and the only person who was put on trial for it received a not-guilty verdict. The timeline for the novel is actually 2001 - 2005, but Ms. Viswanathan manages to bring 1985 and the aftermath right after the disaster to the forefront for us through the eyes and pen of Ashwin Rao . Rao is writing a book about some of the victims families twenty years after the crash. He interviews some of the families who lost loved ones in the crash. I think the main thing that I took away from this book is that people touched by tragedy, especially sudden, violent tragedy, never really fully recover. At the very least they are forever changed by the event.

The story is very lyrical, and traces a researcher who was affected by the Air India tragedy. Through his research, he becomes close to another family who also experienced the tragedy.

It crashed into the Atlantic Ocean while in Irish airspace. It was the first bombing of a 747 jumbo jet. A total of 329 people were killed, including 268 Canadians, 27 British citizens and 24 Indians. The majority of the victims were Canadians of Indian ancestry. The incident was the largest mass murder in Canadian history,Who were these people who were on board the 747 jumbo jet? Who were their families? How did they cope a loss so personal, so tragic? In her new novel The Ever After of Ashwin Rao, Padma Viswanathan explores the stories that weren\u2019t told. It is 2004. Almost 20 years after the brutal bombing and two suspects are on trial. Ashwin Rao, an Indian psychologist trained in Canada, returns to Canada to do a study on comparative grief, interviewing people who lost a loved on in the Air India bombing. What he neglects to mention is that he too had family members on the plane. As he interviews the families, he becomes embroiled in the lives of one family caught in the undertow of the tragedy. In the process, he is forced to deal with his own emotional turmoil.Padma Viswanathan is a Canadian playwright and fiction writer, and in The Ever After of Ashwin Rao does a phenomenal job covering the multiple layers of grief, and manages to take us on the its long winding path to recovery. In addition to bringing a human side to a historical disaster, which is the author\u2019s strength in her publication, we have in The Ever After of Ashwin Rao, Padma Viswanathan\u2019s (perhaps) audacious attempt to tackle issues of societal change: identity and one\u2019s place in the social fabric; the baggage of colonialism; class divisions that refuse to wither away; bringing the conflicts of the past into the present and into a new homeland; and what does it mean to be a \u201cCanadian\u201d when the immediate marker of skin colour marks one perceived as \u201cthe other.\u201dThe story starts off with strong momentum, but just like a plane on a trajectory that is overly ambitious it feels like it may stall halfway. In the same vein one can be critical in surmising that The Ever After of Ashwin Rao is on its own flight of Icarus in attempting to touch upon ideas beyond the scope of the book\u2019s strengths \u2013that characters and their stories \u2013 however, in the light of the recent plane crash in Malaysia, the story and the sorrows become resoundingly relatable to us once more, despite a tragedy that occurred over almost three decades ago.

When I picked up this book, I was a little embarrassed about that fact, and much more so after I finished the book.I found this book interesting, but ultimately I found it unsatisfying on a few levels.- This book is partly about the nature of memory, public and private. That's an area I find endlessly fascinating, and while the book definitely explored this, I found myself always slightly distanced from the events. As a narrator, Ashwin Rao set my teeth slightly on edge. I suspect many people will not be bothered by this, but it was a niggling irritation for me. He was ever so slightly pompous and condescending, and while totally fitting to the character Viswanathan created, it just put me off.- I found the structure puzzling. Though Ashwin Rao sets out to interview many families, we briefly meet Rao's brother in law (Rao's sister and her children died in the crash), and the rest of the book is spent with two Indian families in a town in the Kootenay Mountains. The story is not told linearly, but instead meanders through the past. I understand that this partly a function of memory, and partly the way that Viswanathan is exploring memory and how we tell our stories, but I didn't always feel like I understood why she had chosen to tell a particular part of the story at a particular time.I thought the way that Viswanathan explored Canada's uneasy history with Indian immigrants, the longterm effects of colonialism and the way that the commonwealth can make people feel rootless was skillfully handled. When the characters were confronted with these issues, I found them particularly sympathetic.I'm certainly not sorry I read this book, and would recommend it as an interesting exploration of a part of our history that many Canadians are under informed on. One of my favourite historical theorists, Chakrabarty, writes about the difficulty of writing inclusive histories under colonialism, and suggests that we look to sources beyond what we would normally consider to be historical documents to understand how people tell their own stories. Ultimately, I found this book disappointing, because I wanted it to be more than it was, but I am glad I read it."}, {"userName": "Lisa", "userReviewDate": "Sep 03, 2014", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/1758411-lisa", "userReview": "Some time in my adolescence when I stopped thinking about myself so much, I began to wonder how it was that my parents had learned to live with the losses of WW2, and how the Holocaust survivors in my neighbourhood had managed to rebuild their lives.

Ashwin Rao lost a sister and her two children in the 1985 Air India bombing, but his plans for writing a book about the impact on families of the victims doesn\u2019t include analysing his own feelings. While Ashwin is at pains to narrate his story objectively, it doesn\u2019t take long for the reader to realise that Ashwin has cut himself off from even the possibility of relationships, even to the extent of having a vasectomy so that he can\u2019t ever suffer the pain of losing a child. \u2018Tis better to have loved and lost, than never to have loved at all\u2019? Not for Ashwin, it isn\u2019t.At home neither in his birthplace India nor the tight-knit Indian communities in Canada, Ashwin is prompted by the long-delayed trial of the home-grown radical Sikh bombers to return to Canada (where he was trained in \u2018narrative therapy\u2018). He is ambivalent about attending: A Screaming Reluctance to See It had battled in me with A Driving Compulsion to See It. And when he gets there he feels that the trial is a sham. It is 20 years after the event and it was too late because (post 9/11) everything had changed, and nothing at the trial would do anything to prevent future terrorism. As for the perpetrators, hot air buffoons not worthy of naming, there is no adequate punishment and no government in the world possessed a moral sceptre weighty enough to flog these puny fellows.

This seems to me the strongest overall list that I have seen in the past ten years, with a combination of emotional intensity, deep character probing and skilled writing in all the novels that is remarkable. And the social and political relevance of the books is powerful, with insights into mental illness, the abuse of human rights, the devastations of war and terrorism, and the realities of poverty.This novel is a dramatic story of the effects of Canada's worst terrorist attack, the 1985 bombing of Air India's flight from Vancouver, focused around an examination of the surviving families and friends of the victims some 25 years later. Ashwin Rao is a self-described social analyst who feels able to undertake a cool and detached study of these impacts, despite the deaths of several of his closest relatives in the attack. But as he carries his work into the field, interviewing survivors, he finds his emotional detachment dissolving -- and the ongoing effects on his own life become as much a subject of this novel as the other aspects he is probing. Moving back and forth between Canada and India, this is an insightful novel on the pressures and dynamics of immigration, especially as generations change and attachment to the country of origin lessens. It is also a novel with a strong set of statements about terrorism -- the human destruction of this bombing is underlined, the fact that it was above all an attack on Canadians is stressed, but there is also a sophisticated dissection of the abusive factors that precipitated the attack in India.I would have hoped that the novel could have concluded with more sense of resolution, and clearer outcomes associated with several of the main characters. Nevertheless, its emotional intensity makes this a book to admire and read."}, {"userName": "Kimbofo", "userReviewDate": "Dec 26, 2014", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/7472749-kimbofo", "userReview": "Padma Viswanathan\u2019s second novel, The Ever After of Ashwin Rao, has been shortlisted for this year\u2019s Giller Prize.

More than 300 people were killed \u2014 mainly Canadian citizens \u2014 but the case was not brought to trial until 2004, the year in which the book is set.

He, too, lost family members in the tragedy \u2014 his sister and her two children \u2014 but he\u2019s not always forthcoming about this, because he wants to keep his \u201cprofessional distance\u201d.

In fact is Ashwin Rao really the main character? Is this a story of his search for life meaning after he loses his sister, niece and nephew in the Air India bombing or Seth's or the character who gets centre stage at the end of the book? Although I'm not usually comfortable with switches in books such as character chapters or time sequence I liked the hold that Padma Viswanathan put on me as read about many characters' searches for life's purpose. Upon finishing the book I felt a little more clear on the role of \"guru\" but what I found most interesting was Sita's stepping out of searching. She says \"I didn't renounce desire, or ambition... I lost them. I have broken with nature. I live outside of its circle. I am a stranger to all.\" Although eerie there is something God-connected and enlightened about that kind of peace. Yet this book's greatest gift might be its further elaboration on Canadian identity. How many Canadians feel the straddling of two cultures - the safety and embrace of Canada and at the same time its sharp edges of racism. I'd never thought about the injustice of the Air India trial and I must admit I held the deaths as international and thus not as \"close to home\". This book, in the end, gave me an opportunity to ruminate on life's purpose while at the same time examining my relationship to all people. In some way those two storylines are two sides of the same coin and part of the mastery of Viswanathan."}, {"userName": "April ", "userReviewDate": "Oct 13, 2014", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/4034908-april", "userReview": "This was a hard slow read at first, but ultimately a good one. The scope of the book shows Viswanathan's talent for multiple characters and large epic tales. The author ambitiously takes on the 1976 Sikh bombing of the Canadian Air India Flight, and even more ambitiously, explores the various ways that grief from a sudden disaster stunts, stuns, and paralyzes. Unfortunately, that very topic is one from which humans naturally shy away; nobody likes to think that life is uncontrollable and that disaster can happen in a heartbeat and take decades to get over; it isn't fun to read about either. Yet since the main character is a psychiatrist exploring the effects of the tragedy on those left behind, the tone of grief (and not even new grief, but old grief transmuted into mere unhappiness or more stifling race rage) permeates much of the first half of the novel. Fortunately, humor slips inside the grief in various ways, making it much more bearable. I learned a great deal about this political and historical topic and Viswanathan is persuasive in her theses that, sooner or later, violence always begets violence and that if white Canadians had been killed on this flight, the governmental response would have been quite different. However, I sometimes found it hard to relate to all the detail. I liked the last third of the book the best, when various characters begin to emerge from their cocoons and accept life as it is rather than as they wished it had been."}, {"userName": "Lynette Monteiro", "userReviewDate": "Nov 12, 2014", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/4774814-lynette-monteiro", "userReview": "Through the device of a psychological exploration of the impact of the bombing of Air India 182, Padma Viswanathan takes us on a spiralling journey into the life of Ashwin Rao and the families who are left behind.

There's something though in its structure that doesn't quite hold. Part of this is a product of having too many characters.

The narrative voice also feels scattered \u2013 on the one hand reading in a journalistic style and then swaying to one more literary. Points of view change as well which further complicates the flow of the narrative. It is an obviously very well researched novel and I respect Viswanathan's attempts to look at tragedy from multiple perspectives and angles.
