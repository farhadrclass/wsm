It's just a shame that graphic novels are over so quickly and now we must wait a whole year for the sequel.Wires and Nerve picks up shortly after the end of Winter. It is basically the fifth book in the Lunar Chronicles and does contain spoilers for all previous books - so if you haven't finished the others don't make the mistake of thinking this is a completely separate story. The protagonist here is Iko, the charming and - as you will soon see - badass android that's been with Cinder from the very beginning. And it was really enjoyable. The characters we know and love all make an appearance, and Meyer's trademark humour keeps the story light between the royal politics and drama. Iko is now a hunter, searching for rogue wolf-hybrids all over the world. She also has to deal with being the \"forgotten hero\", her name kept out of the history books because she is an android, and therefore not considered a real person. Her behaviour and feelings are constantly being questioned - her fiery temper considered a \"malfunction\" and her emotions considered \"artificial\".This series is a whole lot of light silliness, easy to digest science-fiction, and romance, but underneath there's a constant subtle nod to the outsiders; those who have had to fight to be heard or taken seriously because of who they are. I like that.Plus, getting a visual of this diverse cast of characters was wonderful: the Chinese Cinder and Kai, the black Iko and Winter, and the white Scarlet, Cress and Thorne. Perhaps the only thing missing from this series is some good LGBT representation. I was secretly hoping that for Iko, but I guess I'll deal with Kinney for now. The love/hate between the two of them is perfect!Blog | Facebook | Twitter | Instagram | Youtube"}, {"userName": "Cait \u2022 A Page with a View", "userReviewDate": "May 20, 2016", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/47412532-cait-a-page-with-a-view", "userReview": "That was... kind of odd. I tried to go into it with low expectations and not compare it with The Lunar Chronicles books since it's a different format! But most of the characters didn't seem like themselves (especially Thorne) and the tone was drastically different. I did love how well Iko's personality came through in her narration! And it was fun to see familiar characters together again (except I really wasn't huge on Thorne here. He turned into a wimpy tween boy and went from being my favorite character to my least favorite). There's not much with Scarlet, Kai, or Wolf, but they do come in at the end. Most of the plot focuses on Cinder getting ready to abdicate her throne to form a republic while Iko hunts down rogue Lunar special operatives and meets up with Cress & Thorne.I've told a lot of adults and grandparents to read The Lunar Chronicles because they're fun for all ages, but this book definitely felt like I was too old for the target audience at times. A lot of scenes were either cringeworthy or just... not the same characters?? And I really wasn't that big on the illustrations, either. So I think this will be really fun for the right audience, but it's not something I'd recommend for everyone who loved The Lunar Chronicles. The story and characters aren't a very strong continuation of the book series -- this graphic novel is kind of doing its own thing now. And that's not bad! I'm just pretty neutral on it overall."}, {"userName": "Melissa \u2665 Dog/Wolf Lover \u2665 Martin", "userReviewDate": "Apr 26, 2016", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/17438949-melissa-dog-wolf-lover-martin", "userReview": "What a cute little graphic novel! I love The Lunar Chronicles! \u2764In this first book we touch base with all of the main characters from the books, some more so than others. I'm sure they will all have major parts in the other books in the series. In this one Iko is running around taking down some of the wolf pack hybrids that Levana had made during her reign. They were all supposed to come in and get rehabilitated But that didn't really happen. Also, Kai is off doing stuff and Cinder has some plans of her own that the council doesn't like. Scarlet and Wolf are on their farm which is sweet. Carswell and Cress are running around with Iko after one point. It will all come together when you read the novel.

But I'm glad to say that this volume did not disappoint.Wires & Nerve follows Iko, the beloved android from the Lunar Chronicles, on a dangerous and romantic new adventure \u2013 with a little help from Cinder and the Rampion crew (which had me over the moon excited).When rogue packs of wolf-hybrid soldiers threaten the tenuous peace alliance between Earth and Luna, Iko takes it upon herself to hunt down the soldiers' leader. She is soon working with a handsome royal guard who forces her to question everything she knows about love, loyalty, and her own humanity.Iko was one of my favorite members of the group, so I loved that her wit and humor was translated so well into this graphic novel format. She's as brave and loyal as ever fighting for her true friend and queen. And my love for this crew is exhilarating.Speaking of love, here are some of favorite moments:\nLove her side commentary more than ever!!\n\nIko's not kidding around!! To quote the blurb, she's a badass with a heart of (mechanized) gold. \nI was glad to see that good 'ol humor of hers along with her love for Kai hadn't changed.\nI loved Thorne with every bit of my heart in TLC. But I found that his trademark snark and direct remarks seemed kind of forced in here.But thankfully his love for Cress is still alive and well!!\nAnd so is her love for the net dramas!\nAs well as Iko's:\nThough said love didn't always bring them into the best situations.\nMy queen, Selene Blackburn of Luna, educating the world!Side note: the art style took a bit to get used to because it wasn't even close to how I'd imagined the characters, especially the way Wolf was depicted. But over time it became less noticeable once I got into the swing of the story.\nAH!! Wolf's still the sweetest!! Speaking of...\nI loved this moment so much!!!\nAll in all: I would say that even though it took me a bit to get through this volume, my love for the Rampion crew slowly but surely resurfaced. Iko & Cinder & Winter & Cress & Thorne & Kai & Wolf & Jacin all have a special place in my heart. And I simply cannot wait for volume two to come out!!\nNote: I'm an Amazon Affiliate.

I didn\u2019t hate it, but I definitely didn\u2019t love it either. Still Lunar Chronicles trash tho. Pros:I enjoyed the overall plot and seeing what happened once Cinder took the throne! It\u2019s great seeing the changes she makes her struggles with the organization. The interaction with the wolf-operatives felt plausible and different from what we'd previously read. Iko is just as great as ever. Her loyalty and friendship and such a strong presence on every page, but I also love her self-confidence and determination. (She\u2019s also still hilarious)It\u2019s all my babies???? And they are alive and well (mostly) and in happy relationships??? It\u2019s just great, okay. Cress and Thorne have a really strong presence in this, and their relationship is still surprisingly cute to me. A bit much in places, but their traveling misadventures were great to see. The new characters really added fun dynamics! I enjoyed seeing Kinney's sister and especially loved meeting Thorne's parents. Cons:\u2026I kind of hate Kinney? Like I get he\u2019s the love interest and it\u2019s supposed to be hate-to-love and all that jazz. But he absolutely believes Iko is less than human and treats her as such. That\u2019s a really uncomfortable dynamic to me. For some reason this recaps everything from the previous books, and this made no sense to me. Why would I be reading this spin-off if I hadn\u2019t read the actual series??A lot of the characters felt off. Scarlet felt really muted while Thorne was a little silly in places. It was never enough to be awful, but just enough it was notable. The color scheme of the artwork was cool, but I didn\u2019t care for much else? Wolf especially doesn\u2019t look anything like I pictured. My other problem is that most everyone had the same faces. I can\u2019t find a great example of the art-work, but look at how similar some of the guys are:ThorneKaiIko (top), Thorne (bottom right), Kinney (bottom left)I\u2019m struggling to grab more art here, but almost everyone had the same shaped face and nose, with just very minute details changed. It wasn\u2019t that it looked cartoonesque, it was just everyone was so similarIn Summary:It\u2019s great to be back in this world, but it\u2019s just not the same.---------------I'm here for Iko being precious and kicking butt(Aka: I'm still Lunar Chronicles trash \ud83d\ude4c\ud83c\udffb\ud83d\ude4c\ud83c\udffb)"}, {"userName": "Trina (Between Chapters)", "userReviewDate": "Feb 05, 2017", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/9323164-trina-between-chapters", "userReview": "Loved this! Iko was one of my favorite characters from this series so I'm thrilled she's getting her own story. I also loved seeing the whole gang again!

I got see many characters I missed from the main series in this book, such as Scarlet and Wolf, Captain Thorne and Cress, and Winter and Jacin. I think the story isn't bad at all, of course, it was written by Meyer herself and I could feel the flow of it so well. But the artwork was a major problem foe me since the beginning as I couldn't get myself to enjoy it at all, it should have been better despite the fact that this series is very well-known, it could have been more good-looking.In fact, what I liked is seeing the same old characters from TLR, and you have no idea how much I miss them. However, the junctions between the scenes are not smooth as I hoped it'd be. I felt as though sometimes the story was just left out like that instead of having gimmicks like other comics. Well, I did enjoy this book. I was fond of Iko since Cinder, her character still has many stories waiting to be told and I can see those potentials the author would pick up and use for the next book or series. Can't wait for book two.All in all, if you're a fan of TLC, don't miss this book. This is a filler of what happens before the epilogue in Star Above and it makes the main story more perfect. Plus, I can remember when I read Winter, I thought that the way Cinder struggled to change Lunar's government wasn't mentined that much.

This was definitely a book I was looking forward to. I mean, The Lunar Chronicles are some of my favorite books of ALL TIME! And the characters will always have a special place in my heart. So yeah, I was slightly nervous going into this graphic novel (to say the least). And I am RELIEVED at how wonderful this installment actually was!Wires and Nerve takes place a short while after Winter, but definitely before the final novella in Stars Above. The illustrations of the characters were cute, and fun. And the diversity within the pages was finally apparent with the Asian Cinder and Kai, and black Winter and Iko (YES Iko!). The snark and sass played a huge role in each character along with Marissa Meyer's trademark cute, squeal-worthy romantic scenes (*cough* c'mon now Kinney! *cough*) And despite the fact that Wires and Nerve is a graphic novel, Meyer still managed to include the internal struggles her characters must learn to endure and eventually overcome. And I love that about her books.I was actually surprised that the additional characters were present as much as they were. While Iko's storyline remained the center of attention, every character we know and love from The Lunar Chronicles was just as important as our main android! (Cue excessive fangirling!) My heart could hardly take it!I will say, the only negative I can think of is an inconsistency. Thorne seemed... different than he did in TLC books. I don't know if it was just me, but it seemed like he was lacking his usual charm and sarcasm. So, yes, my only true dislike was the slight disconnect from the characters as a whole... but it was minor enough that I didn't notice it all the time.

I\u2019m too scared to reread the books, because I\u2019m 97% certain they won\u2019t hold up, but I recall them with some degree of fondness. I cited it as my favorite series for a while before realizing that was, no question, not even a little bit true.Still, I loved them. So of course I\u2019m cursed to forever pick up any addition to that series forever. Marissa Meyer has me on the hook, and unless I begin that formidable reread and it turns out to be as massive a disappointment as I suspect, upon that hook I will remain.I didn\u2019t, like, love this book. I didn\u2019t even like it strongly. I found it pretty eh. Will I pick up the sequel? Indubitably. (How long is this series? I\u2019m scared. So is my wallet.)That being said, I read it in a sitting and didn\u2019t hate it. And it\u2019s the little things like that you\u2019re grateful for when your reading year is progressing like mine. (By which I mean, very behind on my reading challenge + giving out one star ratings like it\u2019s my job.)Let\u2019s get into it.For starters...I don\u2019t like the art very much. It\u2019s VERY cartoonish, which is cute, but all the characters look exactly the same. They just have slightly different hairstyles. And it\u2019s weird for the caption to be all \u201cthis is the most beautiful girl in the galaxy\u201d while the picture is of a head with a glorified smiley face on it. Too mean? It\u2019s not bad. It\u2019s just not my cup of tea...and I\u2019d argue not the right choice for a story like this. But that\u2019s just my opinion. (I say, as if everything I ever write on this site is anything more than my dumb opinions.)The characters just felt dull. If I\u2019m remembering the original books in The Lunar Chronicles correctly, the characters are vibrant! They\u2019re funny and amusing and it\u2019s cool to get to follow them around. Well, not Scarlet. Or Wolf. Or Cinder and Kai, most of the time. (My god, why did I love those books so much?) But Cress and Thorne usually guarantee a good time. And Iko is a funny little thing.I\u2019d argue Iko is the most true to my memory of her of the bunch, but even she is toned down. Thorne is VERY different. I swear I can feel the author trying to recapture Thorne\u2019s voice, and just...not getting there. It\u2019s upsetting. All the characters become so flat. And that definitely wasn\u2019t a problem in the original series.Plot-wise, this wasn\u2019t terrible. I was a bit bored, but that\u2019s fair - this is the setting-up of what is supposed to be a series, maybe? We follow Iko as she\u2019s trying to capture the wolf soldiers leftover from a past storyline in hiding on Earth. Every once in awhile we meet up with another member of the gang. It\u2019s fine. But then some tough wolf guy is like, oh, I don\u2019t think so! I\u2019m going to kill all of you and get all the other remaining wolf people on my side. Oooooh, not that simple, bitches!Here\u2019s the thing, though - and hear me out on this - I\u2019m kind of on Professor Wolfdude\u2019s side.He\u2019s all, \u201cHey, you guys...this is kind of f*cked. Like, we were made into wolf people against our will, which was straight torturous, and then enslaved and forced to kill people. And guys, it\u2019s not even our faults that we now thirst for human flesh. And now the new queen, who\u2019s supposed to be all nice, is just capturing us? And like, killing us if we maybe don\u2019t want to go back to the place where a ton of bad shit happened to us? Nah. I\u2019m not into it.\u201dAnd Iko\u2019s response is pretty much \u201cYou\u2019re wrong ahhhh! I\u2019ll kill you harder now!\u201d So I\u2019m not even rooting for the intended people here. But I digress.Other than that...oh yeah! The romance this series prides itself upon. Every single character is matched up with another character - HETEROSEXUALLY, GUYS. If you were worried about LGBTQ people getting representation here, DON\u2019T. It\u2019s like 1794 but in space.What was I saying? Right. So the relationships are boring here. The narrator just tells us we should think they\u2019re cute, in the hopes that we do. But I\u2019m rebellious and quirky and cool, so it\u2019s not that easy, Meyer! Also, I am against the new love interest introduced here, Liam x Iko, with everything that I am. Liam inherently believes that Iko is incapable of emotion and that robots shouldn\u2019t have rights, and we\u2019re supposed to be like, aw! Cute! That\u2019s not the same thing as hate to love. I would make a comparison here, but it would be toeing the line at best and clearly something is off with me today so I\u2019m just going to wrap this up.Even though this book had problems, I didn\u2019t hate it. I kind of disliked it and found it to be a disappointment, but disappointed is my go to emotion now, baby!Wow, this review is truly a ride. Sorry about that. And I\u2019m not even going to include GIFs. I\u2019m a mess.Bottom line: I read this in a sitting and didn\u2019t despise it with every cell in my body, so it\u2019s getting two stars.

The art style weirded me out at first. Coming from someone who's been binge-reading manga series for the past two weeks, I found the cartoon drawings a little odd. But once I read past a few pages, I got used to it and it didn't bother me at all!Wires and Nerve starts off shortly after the ending of Winter. It reads just like a fifth book to the Lunar Chronicles with pictures. This graphic novel follows Iko, the sassy, fashion-crazy android and Cinder's best sidekick. In this book Iko is hunting down rogue packs of wolf-hybrids. Iko as a secret agent is everything I could ever want. She's a brilliant, awesome narrator whom I couldn't get enough of.As an android, Iko is tired of people underestimating her and saying her feelings aren't \"real\" because she's made of metal instead of flesh and blood. She cares so passionately about her friends and would do anything for them.The characters couldn't be more perfect, and now, in art form, we get to see new details of them. Like, I never imagined Wolf looking so monstrous - I always kind of imagined him as a hugely muscular, hot guy with fangs, to be honest. So when I saw the drawings portraying him as a slightly scary, more beastly person, Scarlet's love for him seemed so much more sincere. They seriously melted my heart.All the other characters were just as heartwarming, from the lovable, awkward mechanic, Cinder, to the cutest computer hacker ever, Cress, the wise Princess Winter (now an ambassador), and Thorne, who was just as swoony and self-absorbed as ever.Really, this book had Marissa Meyer written all over it, from the action sequences, strong female characters, humor, and perfect touches of romance.

Well what was Cinder going to do with a bunch of wolve-hybrid-men who want to eat people? Well she wants to help them and get them fused into the community.But as flesh-hungry beast, they don't always want to listen. Sometimes, they want to stay on earth and have a feast. So who do you call when the Eartheners don't trust the Lunars to come down and get all their puppy-men because they may want to control them with their minds? How about a robot named Iko!?I think this volume was a great start to the series. It's really hard to transition from one art form to the next, as you all are well away from books-to-movies or books-to-television-series. Graphic Novel transitions aren't any different. Iko was portrayed really well I thought. Her personality really came through and I liked that she was the main focus of the series. She was the only one who didn't pair up in the series so I thought maybe she deserved her happily ever after. I also thought she was one of a kind because she was an android with an actual personality.Other characters, I didn't think were portrayed very well. Example Thorne. First, he looked like a teenage boy. Second, he seemed kind of spineless and like a teenage boy instead of the space-pirate I fell in love with. For such a pretty world, I thought maybe the illustrations didn't really fit the story. Standing by themselves, I liked the illustrations. But for something from The Lunar Chronicles, I expected a little more..pretty? That might just be me though.Overall, I thought it was a good start. I went into the graphic novel knowing there were going to be some bumps since we are transitioning into a different from of story telling, and I can tell you it went a lot smoother.

I had such a fun time reading this book, and I am so glad I decided to pick it up!The artwork was extremely cute! Some of the characters didn't look like I pictured and some male characters looked almost identical, but I still really liked the artwork. I thought the artist did a great job at bringing these characters to life. I loved being reunited with all my favorite characters in this novel. All the characters were just as cute, charming, hilarious, and lovable as always. I smiled every time the characters interacted, so I was basically smiling the entire time I read this novel.The plot of this story was filled with plenty of action to keep me on the edge of my seat. I never felt bored while reading this novel! The romances in this story were freaking perfect. There were plenty of scenes that made me swoon and made me say \"aww\" out loud. My little shipper heart felt like it was constantly filled with rainbows and sunshine when the couples interacted.Overall, this book was a quick and delightful read. I 100% recommend that all fans of the original series check this novel out! 5 / 5 FangsMrsLeif's Two Fangs About ItFacebookTwitter"}, {"userName": "Amber Robertson", "userReviewDate": "Aug 05, 2016", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/30813900-amber-robertson", "userReview": "THIS REVIEW CAN ALSO BE FOUND ON MY BLOG, CLICK HERE TO FIND OUT MORE (as well as find my affiliate links)I tried to read Wires & Nerve earlier this year when it first released. Unfortunately, it was difficult on my phone (I had an ebook) and I didn\u2019t get to truly grasp the story. So, when unwrapping the presents my best friend Caitlin got me for Christmas I was so happy to see Wires & Nerve. Honestly, I struggled not to start it immediately. Though, when I did start it I finished it in an hour, so there\u2019s that.The Lunar Chronicles is one of my favourite series and I am not shy about screaming it from the rooftops. So, a companion novel is excellent. I\u2019m not usually a big comic book reader either but for some reason, this was screaming at me to pick it up and read it. I\u2019m so glad I did.Literally, my only complaint about this graphic novel is the characters didn\u2019t look like how I had imagined them so I kept getting caught up on panels and going \u2018who?\u2019 Honestly, that\u2019s it. My own imagination.I\u2019m not even sure how to go about reviewing this? I guess dot points may be the best way because I can say what I want without expending too much (this review would be really short, I have no idea how to extend my thoughts) so let\u2019s go!- Iko is a great lead \u2013 she didn\u2019t have a major part in The Lunar Chronicles besides being Cinder\u2019s sister like character, but she deserved more of a spotlight- The illustrations are gorgeous - I loved seeing more of Cress and Throne + seeing there are consequences to her having lived most of her life in a satellite (her immune system sucks)- There wasn\u2019t much Scarlet or Wolf which I loved because I didn\u2019t really like them, honestly, they were so boring- Winter joking about how sickness now that she has an implant!!!- The fact someone doesn\u2019t have to have read The Lunar Chronicles to read this. Obviously, its suggested but things are explained so if someone wanted to pick this up with no prior knowledge of the series, they could!- An amazingly engaging storyline! It is mainly just set up for the next book but it is so good! Marissa Meyer just has such an engaging writing style, even in comic formI think that\u2019s basically everything that can be said? Wires & Nerve is a great companion novel for the Lunar Chronicles world and I highly suggest it if you have read the series already. It is a quick read that sucks you in and keeps you wondering. I\u2019m glad the sequel comes out next month and I don\u2019t have to wait too long.Also, if you're looking to buy any books over at Book Depository, feel free to use my affiliate link!

The Lunar Chronicles is such a satisfying series, we have all these amazing characters, a full story arc AND an \"after\" to the \"happily ever after\". Cinder is dealing with the pressures that come with taking up the lunar crown including the task of rounding up lunar wolf operatives causing trouble on Earth. She sends Iko to hunt them down. Iko has always been Cinder's fun, spunky sidekick. She has this bubbly personality and loves her friends so much but as much as she tries to keep the longing down, she still knows she'll never be a real human. (But she's real enough okay!) Her scenes with Kinney were so funny because he's such a jerk but that's only because he doesn't get it... yet... The Cress/Thorne moments and Cinder/Winter interactions that I desperately hoped for in Winter, I got them here! <3 <3 <3 My only complaint is a tiny personal one because I imagined the art style to be like Saga or Monstress and this was more cartoonish. All in all, I am beyond pleased and excited for Volume 2!Before reading:The Lunar Chronicles is The Gift That Keeps Giving"}, {"userName": "Vicky (the Blowtorch-Wielding OotCDCB\u2122)", "userReviewDate": "Feb 23, 2016", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/21619434-vicky-the-blowtorch-wielding-ootcdcb", "userReview": "The first of 2 graphic novels with IKO as MC...Omg omg.

Esta vez Iko es la protagonista, lo cual le da un giro refrescante a la historia, que se desarrolla entre el final de Winter y el epilogo de Stars Above, lo cual puede ser un punto negativo porque ya sabes como termina, pero es encantador tener a toda la tripulaci\u00f3n de la Rampion de regreso. La trama es cre\u00edble, pues nadie esperaba que la transici\u00f3n de paz entre la Tierra y la Luna fuera f\u00e1cil, es una aventura hilarante de leer para todos los fans de la saga (un bonus es que la edici\u00f3n es preciosa).Todos los personajes de la saga est\u00e1n de regreso, incluidos todos los OTP.

It was like a hot chocolate that you would have on a cold winter's day. It was every feeling of comfort and contentedness that I have ever felt all brought together. I loved that we got to revisit the Lunar Chronicles world and I have just realized that I miss the TLC crew soooo much!! I think I'm going to reread those books soon, but we'll see. I loved the fact that now we get to see from the point of view of Iko, who is close to the top of the list of my favorite TLC characters. She is so funny and adorable and I love her so much. I also loved the cameos that we got to see in this book, with Cress, Thorne, and Cinder all playing a big part and Marissa Meyer giving us the occasional glimpse of Kai, Scarlet, Wolf, Winter, and Jacin. THEY ARE ALL ADORABLE AND I MISS THEM AND I LOVE THEM AND GAH THEY'RE MY CHILDREN!! The only reason I took off a star from this book is because Kinney annoyed me to no end, and the \"tension\" between them feels like such bullshit and I am not a fan of where their relationship seems to be going. But that is the only complaint I have about this book. Conclusion: READ THIS IF YOU LOVE TLC!!!\u00a0~~~I NEED THE NEXT ONE.

And when I heard that the story would continue with Iko, Cinder\u2019s beloved side-kick android, I was so very excited.  As usual life isn\u2019t always smooth-sailing once a war is won and even though Cinder, Kai, Captain Thorne, Cress, Scarlet, Wolf, Jacin, Winter and Iko had managed to destroy the evil Levana and her terrible rein there are still many things that needs to be changed. The most important one is the problem Levana\u2019s army of wolf soldiers are causing, running amok among Earth, killing and terrifying humans and thereby threatening the peace alliance Cinder and Kai is trying to achieve between Earth and Lunar. And Iko has decided that she\u2019s just the person to hunt them down and take them back to Lunar. I loved that we got to see so much of Iko, who despite being an android has never acted robotic. I love her loyalty to her friends and how she has so many feelings which is not something one expects from an android. And I definitely like the strange feelings between her and Cinder\u2019s royal guard Kinney (who is such an ass but I\u2019m hoping he\u2019ll improve). I also loved that we got to see all of the characters I loved: \u2665 Scarlet and Wolf (my favorite couple) that are living on a farm and are just as wonderful and cute as always ;-) \u2665Thorne and Cress who was so freaking adorable in this book!! I totally loved how romantic and cute they were together!  \u2665And then Cinder and Kai, who are currently apart, both of them ruling their worlds and I\u2019m hoping we got to see them together again in the next book.  All in all this was a fantastic graphic novel that just whetted my appetite for more. I can\u2019t wait for the next book."}, {"userName": "Sharon", "userReviewDate": "Mar 04, 2017", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/23218431-sharon", "userReview": "[Any age really.
