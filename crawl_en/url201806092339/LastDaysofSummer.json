But what we consume doesn\u2019t always have to be good for us. This book was full of empty calories, processed to a point where pretty much every bit of literary goodness was gone. And I ate every bite. A Jewish kid with an absent father moved with his mother and aunt into a tough part of Brooklyn just prior to Pearl Harbor. He and his Japanese-American friend got pummeled on a regular basis. But this kid had moxie (a word more common at that time, I gather). He started writing to the Giants\u2019 up-and-coming star third baseman. These exchanges evolved from wise-ass banter to a sort of charming surrogate father-son relationship \u2013 one where a phrase like \u201cI\u2019ve got your back\u201d had real meaning. Then the bombs began to drop. It\u2019s a promising storyline. Like I said, though, don\u2019t go into this book expecting anything truly substantial. The kid, 12-year-old Joey, was never really credible \u2013 writing and receiving personal letters from FDR, performing in night clubs, formulating war strategies, and so on. And the ballplayer, Charlie, was never completely real despite the author\u2019s attempt to take an inherently big-hearted guy and give him a few rough edges to make him seem plausible. The hero worthy of worship was never far beneath the surface, despite the concocted lunk-headedness. After a while, I decided just to go with it. Snobby as it may sound, I felt that stooping to their uncomplicated level was worth doing, with disbelief duly suspended. Does this have anything to do with the Cubs having the best record in baseball? You bet your sweet Astroturf-free ballpark 3 miles up the road it does. Aside from the fun baseball lore, there was a strong supporting cast: the Japanese-American kid who (no surprise here) had a difficult war, the singer who was sweet on Charlie and helpful to Joey, the aunt with the wisdom of an old soul, a love interest for Joey (think puppies), and a buddy for Charlie from the Giants, famous briefly for the first unassisted triple play in decades. The plot and all its staging were entertaining enough to hold my interest. And it moved about as fast as Tinker to Evers to Chance. (For those who don\u2019t know baseball history, please imagine I just supplied the perfect metaphor for quick and graceful movement.) So no, this wasn\u2019t the edifying read many Goodreaders (myself included) might typically seek out. But if you\u2019re in the mood for candy-coated popcorn, peanuts and a prize, this may be just the thing. Much like the Michelin Guide in rating the concession stand at Wrigley, I couldn\u2019t quite justify four stars for the book, though there\u2019s a simple pleasure in both. Finally, in what you may consider the raison d'\u00eatre of my entire review, let me say this: Go Cubs, go!"}, {"userName": "Tory", "userReviewDate": "Aug 22, 2007", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/41751-tory", "userReview": "Oh man.I laughed, a lot.

A lot of books SAY that they\u2019ll make you laugh and cry, but the books that have made me laugh out loud I could count on one hand\u2026 and I can only think of one other book that made me cry. The Catalpa Tree by Denyse Devlin (incredible book, by the way).It's an epistolary novel, written through letters, telegrams, transcripts of sessions with his therapist, newspaper articles, etc. A story of a Jewish kid in Brooklyn during WWII - Joey Margolis. He gets sent to Juvy for peeing the in reservoir and is a pathological liar. The kid finds a hero in a rookie baseball player and tracks down his home address and his girlfriends address in order to make friends with him.

At a glance through the pages, I wasn't sure I wanted to jump in. I felt like a series of letters and news clippings was going to take away from a cohesive narrative, and I wasn't sure about a story of a kid writing to a baseball player... Really-- where could it possibly go? Within just a couple of pages, I was hooked. The characters are real and compelling. It was laugh out loud funny (I got looks when I was reading in public), and also brought me to tears-- something that very few books have been able to do in recent years.

I just learned this is called an \"epistolary novel\" and stealing from a review below, I know why I am so drawn to this format. \"...are hard to pull off. By ditching conventional plot structure, the writer focuses all the attention on his characters.\" As I've said before, I'll pick good characters over a good plot if I have to choose. So I guess when the focus is totally on that, I get hooked. More to come...I'm about 1/3 in, and am struggling just a tad. It's just a very different style of conversation (because it's a little boy and baseball player in 1940) and sometimes I'm not 100% following the conversation. But I like them both enough already to keep truckin. I feel bad for Joey, as he was dealt a bad hand in many ways. And I'm fascinated by Charlie and how he keeps writing back...Wow, this might just be an all time favorite book. I really did have many LOL moments, but then at the end I was bawling.

By ditching conventional plot structure, the writer focuses all the attention on his characters. If the writer doesn't get the voices just right, readers lose interest in the story being told.Luckily, Kluger is dead solid perfect in The Last Days of Summer. Whether we're hearing precocious 12 year-old Joey Margolis or irascible New York Giants third baseman Charlie Banks or even any of the myriad other voices we're a party to, it just sounds right, and consequently we buy the story. Once we're bought in, occurrences that should seem far-fetched become possible, as they do when you're listening to a really good storyteller.There's a lot of humor here, but there's more, too, as you would expect in a book dealing with a young boy's coming of age and set during wartime.

That was so beautiful! I absolutely LOVED this book! Thank you so much for sharing, because otherwise I would never have stumbled across it or picked it up. I'm grateful! :)To all my other Goodreads friends, this is a MUST READ book. (And for those in YA-MA, it is a GREAT pick for the season challenge, hint hint!) It's 1940 and Joey is a 12 years old Jewish boy living in Brooklyn after his parents divorce. Joey's had a rough start in the new area. He's being bullied pretty badly, made some bad decisions, and has come to the conclusion that there is only one way out of this mess. He has to get up and coming rookie for the New York Giants, Charlie Banks, to hit a home run and dedicating it to him, Babe Ruth style. All he's gotta do is convince him. This leads to one of the most special and endearing friendships I've ever read in a book.\n\"It is Joseph's opinion that he open his Bar Mitzvah speech 'with a few laughs to loosen them up'- more specifically, that worn-out routine chronicling Moses' descent from the mountain with the Ten Commandments, concluding with the epigram 'Adultery's still in.' Given the manner in which the two of them recited the punch line in unison, I gather that Mr. Banks and your son are a well-suited match. So, however, are Laurel and Hardy.\" - Rabbi Morris Lieberman\nI have to warn you, this book is written entirely through letters, report cards, therapist notes, newspaper articles, and baseball stats. I was a little nervous going into it, thinking that it would make it difficult to get a feel for these characters and build a reader/character relationship. Yeah, not a problem at all. I loved each and every one of them just as deeply as one possibly could. Joey was so clever and fearless, even though he was only 12 years old (14 at the end) I truly admired his gumption. I laughed outloud at the boys antics. Poor Charlie never stood a chance, thank goodness. He could be a 'tough guy' all he wanted, but inside he was a big softy. (Don't even get me started on Craig, Aunt Carrie, Hazel and Stuke. They are all so well written and 3 dimensional.)And the book was FUNNY. Laugh out loud funny, I'll have you know. There were wisecracks and one liners throughout the whole thing. Here's just a taste of one that had me laughing outloud!This is Charlie quizzing Joey on the Torah before his Bar Mitzvah:\n3. How old was Noah when God gave him the job?76.600.Says who? And how come God thought an old fart like that could build a boat? He'd be lucky if he could still pee.\nIf you don't read this you're missing out, seriously. Sure it's about baseball, and if you're not into sports you may not understand the baseball stats. I sure as hell didn't, haha. It doesn't matter because love is what this story is really about. It's about love and everlasting friendships. I absolutely loved it. I can guaran-damn-tee that I will be buying this book for my bookshelf and I'll be reading it again and again. I can't wait to read others from this author. Beautiful and Brilliant.\n\"Dear Aunt Carrie and Mrs. M, Hazel did some nosing around and found out that there are 19 million kids in the U.S. of A. Only 10 of them are going to the W. House today. You can do the math yourself on account of I would not get near long division with a 10 ft. pole. But if you tell people that he is one in a million, you would be pretty close to the mark.

I love to chat with other readers and find gems among the fodder at the suggestion of strangers. That's how I found Last Days of Summer by Steve Kluger. I would never have chosen this book--sports stories usually aren't my thing--but I was standing in line waiting to pay for my two-foot stack at the library's $1 book sale this spring when the woman wearing purple scrubs in front of me picked it up from a table, asked me if I'd read it, and told me it was one of her favorite books ever. She said she never would have chosen it, got it in a book exchange, and read it when she was desperate for something to read. Oh well, what's another $1? As she balanced it on top of my stack, she assured me I'd love it. Her instinct was spot on. What a delight! Thank you, thank you, Scrubs Lady! I just finished reading Extremely Loud and Incredibly Close last week, a book that took a lot of thought, concentration and time, so I was ready for something lighter and funnier. When I saw this in my stack, I remembered Scrubs mentioned \"quick and fun,\" and who doesn't think \"baseball\" when it's the middle of summer? If only I liked hot dogs and had some apple pie... Oh well...gobbled this book up in two nights, and laughed out loud almost the entire time! The main character, Joey Margolis, is funny enough, but his hero, Charlie Banks, 3rd baseman of the NY Giants, is a scream--and my hero, too! Every human should be a Charlie Banks. I won't give away the ending, but I was glad everyone else was in bed.

It was excellent and captured my mind and my heart as I followed through roughly two years in the characters lives.Seldom do characters come so alive as they do in this book. I found myself laughing at the hijinks, worrying, and in the end even crying. The story is told in the form of news clippings, letters, and even a few Q and A's. The correspondance goes between an early teen boy from Brooklyn, a baseball player, the White House, and a few other people.I'm not sure what I liked more, the creativity of the boy in his correspondance or his tenacity to get what he wanted.

Back in December 2007 I finished Game of Shadows: Barry Bonds, BALCO, and the Steroids Scandal that Rocked Professional Sports, but never reviewed it. Then there was Bernard Malamud's novel The Natural I read in 2008. In 2009, I started Red Smith on Baseball and finished it in December of 2009.

This was a novel that moved fast and was really easy to take a few quick notes on. The style is interesting. The entire book is a delightful mash of letters and short conversations, secret notes passed in a classroom, ephemera and newspaper clippings that cut off without warning.

I realize that the HEA-rule only applies to romance novels, but I'm not sure this ending was necessary, or even optimal, for this story. In spite of that, this book was another shining example of Steve's talent, and you're meshugana if you don't read it.

The main characters are a 12-year-old boy and a professional baseball player, so I did not expect to connect to them as much as I did. Also, the story is written entirely in letters, notes, ticket stubs, interview dialogue, and newspaper clippings with VERY brief expository prose at the beginning and the end. I had no idea this format could pull me in like it did. The characters were extremely real to me, and I was VERY emotionally invested. WOW. This is a new favorite for sure. Also, I laughed out loud a LOT.Watch my YouTube review: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-88EL..."}, {"userName": "Jason", "userReviewDate": "Jan 14, 2014", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/21036113-jason", "userReview": "Definitely one of my top 5 books. There's huge ass tear stains all over my pillow. I was sobbing. The last time I cried like this over a book was never. I mean, even in the Fault in Out Stars, my eyes leaked a bit. But this time it was snot and tears and the usual ugly crying. I'm not a crier. It takes a lot for me to cry, so this just proves what an excellent book this was. I've been putting it off because of the WWII theme, but it was really really good."}, {"userName": "Julie", "userReviewDate": "Jun 10, 2008", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/822442-julie", "userReview": "This is my new favorite book.
