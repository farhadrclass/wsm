Not only is its treatment of passionate male friendship unique in Renaissance English Drama, but its plotting is exemplary, its rhetoric disciplined, its imagery restrained, and\u2014perhaps its greatest achievement\u2014it expertly summons a coherent historical vision, calling forth the essential events from a myriad of incidents in order to convey a few hard political truths. In addition, not only did Marlowe\u2019s portrait of a weak, self-indulgent monarch inspire Shakespeare\u2019s characterization of Richard II, but his method of using history showed his fellow playwright the way, making possible not only the three great Henry plays but the Roman plays as well. Still, there\u2019s nothing here to astonish me, as Doctor Faustus continually does, no grand rhetoric, like that of Tamburlaine to stir me like a big bass drum, no Machiavellian monologues from Barnabas or the Guise to horrify me with a smile. Marlowe the dramatic technician may triumph, but it is Marlowe the poet and evil genius I love, and I see little of him in Edward II.I\u2019ll conclude with a little of that poetry--and a touch of that evil genius-- I did see here. Piers de Gaveston, the friend and favorite of King Edward, describes the pleasures and pageantry he will use to intoxicate the heart of the king.\nI must have wanton poets, pleasant wits,Musicians, that with touching of a stringMay draw the pliant king which way I please:Music and poetry is his delight;Therefore I'll have Italian masks by night,Sweet speeches, comedies, and pleasing shows;And in the day, when he shall walk abroad,Like sylvan nymphs my pages shall be clad;My men, like satyrs grazing on the lawns,Shall with their goat-feet dance the antic hay;Sometime a lovely boy in Dian's shape,With hair that gilds the water as it glidesCrownets of pearl about his naked arms,And in his sportful hands an olive-tree,To hide those parts which men delight to see,Shall bathe him in a spring; and there, hard by,One like Act\u00e6on, peeping through the grove,Shall by the angry goddess be transform'd,And running in the likeness of an hart,By yelping hounds pull'd down, shall seem to die:Such things as these best please his majesty."}, {"userName": "Bookdragon Sean ", "userReviewDate": "Nov 23, 2015", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/27788046-bookdragon-sean", "userReview": "This is a marvellous play; it is clearly an equal to any of Shakespeare\u2019s histories. It\u2019s such a shame Marlowe had his life cut short; he could have been a real rival to Shakespeare if he wrote more. He\u2019s only got a few plays compared to Shakespeare\u2019s forty or so. He just didn\u2019t write enough before he died; it\u2019s a real tragedy because he had the talent to do so much more. Well, anyway, this is still superb regardless of Marlowe\u2019s short repertoire of writing. I love the tragic elements, and I love the relationship between King Edward and his Gaveston. It\u2019s complex and real. Edward is clearly madly in love with Gaveston, but I\u2019m not entirely sure that his lover returns the passion. He has some feelings for Edward, this much is clear, but I think he is mainly using him for social advancement. He wants to get back at the nobles who have laughed at him, and looked down on his peasant class. So, he uses Edward as a shield to hide behind as he attempts to return the disdain. Well, the only problem is that Edward is a very flimsy shield. He is a weak King. Not just because he is homosexual, like the ignorant writers of  Braveheart will have you believe, but because he has no backbone. This isn\u2019t because he is gay; he just happens to be gay as well as weak. The two are not related. His nobles push him around and bully him because of his lack of strength. They manipulate him and he doesn\u2019t have the power to prevent it. Gaveston is a stronger man than he in this. He stands up for what he believes in whereas Edward just lets the world overrule him. He lacks the abilities of a strong ruler. His wife is a more authoritative monarch and his young son even more so. All in all, Marlowe\u2019s Edward is a doormat. Indeed, he causes his own demise at the end of the play, which is a horrible end; it\u2019s almost a mockery of his sexuality. He gets killed by having a hot poker shoved up his arse. This is to prevent physical evidence of his murder being easily perceivable on his corpse. I mean, the medievalists wouldn\u2019t check there for a cause of death if they checked at all. It\u2019s horribly ironic and brutal. It\u2019s actually based upon some flimsy truth, but there are all sorts of conspiracy theories about that. Personally, I love the way Ken Follet handled it  The World Without End. He let his Edward escape, but Marlowe couldn\u2019t of done that in a play; it needed its tragic ending.\u201cAll live to die, and rise to fall.\u201d The two lovers caused their own deaths. Edward was too absorbed in his lover\u2019s arms where as Gaveston was too arrogant. He attracted the wrath of the nobility when he needed to be humble to survive. He pushed them too far and angered them too much. They were both fools, but characters that can easily be sympathised with. Edward saw nothing but his Gaveston, and Gaveston saw nothing but prestige and glory. It\u2019s a great play; I wish I could find a copy of the Ian Mckellen version somewhere. I bet he nailed the role."}, {"userName": "Jean", "userReviewDate": "Apr 26, 2016", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/19300421-jean", "userReview": "[Edward's death with a red-hot poker thrust into his bowels (hide spoiler)]"}, {"userName": "Andrei Tama\u015f", "userReviewDate": "Mar 01, 2017", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/25858385-andrei-tama", "userReview": "Tragedie istoric\u0103 \u00een cinci acte, surprinz\u00e2nd \u00eentreaga domnie a regelui Eduard al II-lea al Angliei.

Now, because I am not homosexual I have never been interested in gay cinema, however this movie intrigued me even more when I discovered that it was written by the one and only Kit Marlowe.\tAs I read through this play (the second time that is) I came to realise how it does fall into the category of gay literature because it revolves around the love affair between King Edward II of England and his lover Piers Galveston, who happens to be a commoner. In a way this play could easily be about any king of that period who falls in love with a commoner, however the fact that his lover is male no doubt adds insult to injury. Kings would have had their fare share of concubines and prostitutes, and while I thought that the issue that confronted the antagonists of the play was that he was sleeping with a commoner, the more of think about it the more I realise that this probably went on all the time.\tThe problem was that his lover was a man, and a commoner, and the concern that the antagonists had was that Galveston held power over Edward and as such could use his influence as Edward's lover to better his position, as well as holding the hear of the king. However Galveston is pretty quickly dealt with by the antagonists, much to the king's horror, and we then learn that he finds himself another lover. What is really interesting is that this story is true \u2013 according to this play Edward II was a homosexual, and the only reason that he married Queen Isabella was so that he might have legitimate children to inherit the throne.\tOne could see this as a tale of a jilted lover, that being Isabella, who was effectively sidelined in favour of Galveston, but the truth of the matter is that royalty do not marry for love, they marry for political convenience (or at least they did in those days) so it would not be all that uncommon for royals to only have sex with their partners to produce legitimate offspring. Further, I am not convinced that the problem necessarily lay with the fact that Edward was having an affair with another male because no doubt that was occurring as well, but the problem was the status of his lover. A king could not marry a commoner, but no doubt he could have one as a concubine. However I suspect that it was different when it came to males because what we see here, and it is emphasised throughout the play, is that this was not the Greek or Roman idea of an old man sleeping with a young man, but rather a relationship of love, and a relationship that threatened to upset the social order \u2013 he was in love with a commoner and was raising the commoner to the position of a noble, which was something that was not to be done.\tHowever, as the play moves on (and Marlowe has compressed the entire reign of Edward II into the play, as well as the epilogue where Edward III seeks revenge against the antagonists Mortimer and Isabella) it comes to light that Edward is not a strong king, but Mortimer, being Isabella's lover (and there is no criticism of that relationship) has gained such power that he is able to take the position of regent (namely the king that rules in place of a child king) and arranges for Edward's death. Yet Edward was not universally hated, particularly since Edward III after his coronation orders the release of his uncle, and then turns on Mortimer to make sure that his reign does not come to an abrupt end (as generally happened in those times). Mind you, from what I have read of the story of Edward III dealing with Mortimer, it was a lot more bloodier than occurred in this play, however the name of Mortimer has now come down to us as the atypical name of a bad guy. \tSuch is the power of the literary genius."}, {"userName": "Rozonda", "userReviewDate": "Sep 10, 2011", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/1899-rozonda", "userReview": "Like Shakespeare's Richard II, Edward is an ineffective ruler but not an evil one; Richard prized luxury and pleasure, Edward is blinded by his love for a male commoner.

Even if we know he brought about his own disgrace we can't help but pitying this helpless king who is brutally murdered and we cheer when his son avenges him rightfully.A story of power, desire and human failure, Edward II is poignant and beautiful and probably Marlowe's masterpiece."}, {"userName": "Ana R\u00eenceanu", "userReviewDate": "Mar 15, 2014", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/28781546-ana-r-nceanu", "userReview": "The 1970 stage adaptation of this play stars Sir Ian McKellen and James Laurenson.

He was a double spy who served the quin Elizabeth who saved him from getting into prison by interfering a lot of times, and who belonged to a dangerous group called \"The School of Night.\" He took the PHD and the Ma Student. He was a very dangerous man as she said. nice....i am telling you his life is not boring, it is actually very... very interesting.sorry, my point is that i decided to read all his works, and by accident i discovered that he had a play talking about a king and his homosexual lover and then i became like SOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOO SHOCKED... I searched the web, downloaded the book and started reading.... and wow...look what the lover \"Gaveston\" says \"I have my wish, in that I joy thy sight;And sooner shall the sea o'erwhelm my land\" me heart becomes like this king Edward \"Thy worth, sweet friend, is far above my gifts,Therefore, to equal it, receive my heart.If for these dignities thou be envied,I'll give thee more; for, but to honour thee,\" the evil conspirators nobles \"We'll hale him from the bosom of the king,And at the court\u2212gate hang the peasant up,Who, swoln with venom of ambitious pride\" the Q. Isab 'the wife' \"Unto the forest, gentle Mortimer,To live in grief and baleful discontent;For now, my lord, the king regards me not,But doats upon the love of Gaveston.He claps his cheeks, and hangs about his neck,Smiles in his face, and whispers in his ears\" the king plead his love to Gaveston \"Because he loves me more than all the world.Ah, none but rude and savage\u2212minded menWould seek the ruin of my Gaveston;You that be noble\u2212born should pity him.\" after they make him exile his lover \"I'll come to thee; my love shall ne'er decline.\" To be continued....  So, this is a play, about a weak king who falls in loved with a low ranked man. his followers wouldn't accept the fact and they rebel against him, killing his minion. he gives everything for his revenge, his crown, England, and his soul \"O Gaveston, 'tis for thee that I am wrong'd,For me, both thou and both the Spencers died! And for your sakes a thousand wrongs I'll take.The Spencers' ghosts, wherever they remain.\" it is a true love and sincere passion. the play ends after the death of many characters, between them the king Eduard himself. It is very sad but i couldn't imagine a better ending, especially that it ends with justice. The weakness of the father, and the story of the father leaves Edward the III no choice but to be strong and rough against those who conspired against his father and killed him a long with his uncle. my rating is 5 stars...it is an amazing play.although it took from me a lot of time, but if i didn't have to study, i would have finished in less than a day. *something i didn't like was Edward's moaning an wailing, another is the lack of stage directions, but then you have to work your imagination on it, you could even imagine the happening in side the doors :) ....I highly recommend this book, to those who seek for true love, and a relationships between two different ranks....I think it is like my professor said that if Marlowe wasn't killed when he was young, he would achieve a lot, and he could compare Shakespeare. don't think that i am ignorant about Shakespeare's art cos I've read a lot of his poems.

Both plays are based on similar chronicles about weak Plantagenet kings during the turbulent times framed by the War of the Roses. They are both historically inaccurate, carefully written to pass the censureship constraints and to comply with the propaganda needs and desires of the Tudor dynasty which overthrew and succeeded the Plantagenets. Both plays depict the unruly and often bloody, machiavellian political power struggles of the times, between king and feudal barons. They are fast-paced, gory narratives with memorable key scenes with twisting plot lines as the struggle favours now one, then another party.Although Marlowe appears to have a better grasp of classical education, which shows itself in allusions to greek and roman deities and in its inclusions of some passages in latin (usually cut in modern productions), Marlowe\u00b4s language in this play is sparer and, for the modern reader, simpler than Shakespeare at the stage of Richard II; there are fewer allusions and less word play and punning. Marlowe is crueller and more sadistic. The final death scene of Edward II is more harrowing than anything in Shakespeare, with the exception of the blinding in King Lear. Marlowe reports on Edward\u00b4s cold-blooded gaolers indulging in psychological deprivation and physical hardships in order to break the king, while the professional assasin, Lightborne, relishes in his knowledge of methods of murder, dwelling, for example, in detail on the use of particular poisons. He calls on his assistants to \"..lay the table down, and stamp on it/But not too hard, lest that you bruise his body\", thus, presumably letting Edward die of internal injuries, to the point where Lightborne gets carried away by his handicraft and proudly exclaims in self-admiration \"Tell me sirs, was it not bravely done?\".If you like Shakespeare\u00b4s early historical plays, I would highly recommend this play, if only to see what sort of competition Shakespeare was up against in his own time. I would also recommend reading this play while listening to the first two episodes of BBC Radio\u00b4s 1977 26-episode BBC radio drama Vivat Rex, in which John Hurt portrayed Edward. These two episodes constitute a slightly abridged version of the play and add a narrator (Richard Burton) to help identify where and when the different scenes take place."}, {"userName": "Timothy Ferguson", "userReviewDate": "Oct 01, 2013", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/5448045-timothy-ferguson", "userReview": "It\u2019s always interesting to listen to Elizabethan plays which aren\u2019t Shakespeare. It lets you see how much of the grandeur of his work is based one what, back then, was a sort of national style. Marlowe does good work here, and the readers in the Librivox version are great, but he\u2019s let down a little by the historical events he\u2019s chosen to portray, and the political slant he takes. Basically this is the period where Edward II is infatuated with Piers Gaveston, and splits his realm in half over it. I presume I\u2019m meant to be on Edward\u2019s side, as he loses everything for love. It is, however, hard favour him, because he goes about the whole business in such a dreadfully stupid way.If he\u2019d just kept Gaveston as an Extra Gentleman of the Wardrobe, it would have been considered a bit odd, but since he\u2019d already fathered an heir, it would have been easy enough for him to get away with. Some of the Stewarts get away with this sort of thing. His flaw is that he wants to make his lover the most powerful noble other than him in the Realm. Powerful forces of reaction rise up and destroy him. Then Marlowe chickens out on the real historical drama and has Edward III roll in and kill the conspirators.In real life, the queen and her lover, Mortimer, controlled the kingdom. Young Edward, knowing he\u2019d be killed if he got in their way, played a masterful game of pretending to be a young buffoon. He used tournaments and binges to mask the consolidation of a power bloc within the younger generation and those disaffected with the current regime. Then, with a band of his tournament friends, he captured and executed Mortimer, and forced his mother into a nunnery. I think Edward\u2019s early life is a great story, and Marlowe just skips it entirely.Recommended for Shakespeare fans, and those liking stories of tragic infatuation.This review originally appeared on book coasters"}, {"userName": "Manik Sukoco", "userReviewDate": "Jul 09, 2015", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/44105134-manik-sukoco", "userReview": "The edition of Edward II I read was the New Mermaid Series one, which had a very good and informative introduction, and has the spelling modernized.

Great insight into a great play."}, {"userName": "Samet ", "userReviewDate": "Feb 24, 2016", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/5945423-samet", "userReview": "What a historical figure.How adorable, how pleasing love is.The intimacy of two men regardless of disparate backgrounds, regardless of hostile and evil attitudes.Love is love.Love is love.Edward's inner world, naivety that grasp my whole attention.What a great reading experience it was."}, {"userName": "Jamie", "userReviewDate": "May 13, 2013", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/1098316-jamie", "userReview": "Written in 1594 with a slightly cryptic typeset where 'f' is 's' and 'f', 'VV' is 'W,' 'u' is 'v' and 'u,' etc., yet after a few pages the conversion of letters becomes almost automatic. Long play, large cast of characters, with important death scenes too briefly brushed away. Yet this is a rare play that is able to turn a villain into a hapless human being and a virtuous hero into a villain."}, {"userName": "Amy V", "userReviewDate": "Oct 11, 2015", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/16957555-amy-v", "userReview": "I love Marlowe, and this is one of his best - confusingly heartbreaking and brilliant and incredible. Edward's speech in Act 3 Scene 2 (lines 128-47) is so fantastically bombastic that I just want to have it played on loop constantly. If I had a one-use time machine I would 100% spend my singular journey preventing Marlowe's premature death."}, {"userName": "Melissa", "userReviewDate": "Jan 16, 2017", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/15207800-melissa", "userReview": "What.
