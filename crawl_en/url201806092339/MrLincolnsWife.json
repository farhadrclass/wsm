I liked this book because it really focused on Mary Todd Lincoln. It shared her story from the time of their difficult courtship until her old age. Instead of portraying her as crazy like a lot of books do. This one took a lighter approach and tried to show things from her point of view."}, {"userName": "Pamela", "userReviewDate": "Nov 21, 2014", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/20048096-pamela", "userReview": "If ever there was a book that deserved consideration of republishing, exciting fans of literary-quality historical fiction, it would be \"Mr. Lincoln\u2019s Wife\u201d by Anne Colver. I can think of several friends who would enjoy reading this enthralling and insightful fictionalized biography of Mary Todd Lincoln, but considering it was published in 1943, then again in 1965, it might be a challenge acquiring an affordable copy in good condition. But it would be certainly worth the attempt. \u201cMr. Lincoln\u2019s Wife\u201d opens in Springfield, Illinois, 1837, to a family dinner hosted by Elizabeth Todd Edwards, where the reader is immediately privy to the powerful influences of Todd women from Kentucky - women who are known to be strong, tenacious, outspoken trend-setters lording over social graces, fashion, household decorum, and the bolstering of their husband\u2019s status and careers. And it is also humorously plain to see that Elizabeth is the Todd matchmaking monarch, especially when it comes to her younger sisters. Mary Todd, however, doesn\u2019t cozy to Elizabeth\u2019s emblematic matchmaking. She wants no part of Mr. Edwards or any other upper-echelon trophy on her dance card. To Elizabeth\u2019s horror, Mary becomes fascinated with the gangly, homely, backwoods speaking, gadabout Mr. Abe Lincoln. And no matter how much Elizabeth tries to sway Mary otherwise, Mary won\u2019t budge an inch. Nothing or no one is going to stand in Mary\u2019s way of getting what she wants \u2013 not even the lackadaisical, socially inept and slow-to-commit Mr. Lincoln himself. Of course, most Americans and many history buffs abroad know that Mr. Lincoln (a then practicing attorney) eventually came around and married Miss Mary Todd in 1842, where they lived in Springfield for a spell and had four children. Then in 1861 Abe became the 16th president of the United States \u2013 a president renowned for the Gettysburg Address and Commander in Chief of the Civil War. And then sadly, April 14th 1865, while enjoying a theatrical performance by Mary\u2019s side at Ford\u2019s Theatre, President Lincoln was assassinated. However, those are just cold hard facts. The fullness of life is in the complexities of emotions and details of living. From birth to death, life is a series of highs and lows: Exuberance of possibilities - Pain of rejection \u2013 Love \u2013 Parenthood \u2013 Loneliness \u2013 Pride of accomplishment \u2013 Heart wrenching grief \u2013 Stigmatizing prejudice \u2013 Satisfaction - Fear of failure \u2013 Jealousy \u2013 Humility of defeat \u2013 Exuberance in winning \u2013 Crush of death. Yes, it is the expressing of these emotions and life details comprising the life of Mary Todd Lincoln, and capturing the full essence of time and place, through Anne Colver\u2019s astute humanistic pen that makes \u201cMr. Lincoln\u2019s Wife\u201d such a phenomenal captivating story. A five star Top-Pick - Recommended to tenacious connoisseurs of exceptionally written historical fiction."}, {"userName": "Edith", "userReviewDate": "Aug 01, 2017", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/1532818-edith", "userReview": "Published in 1943, this story of Mrs. Mary Lincoln is kindly and compassionately told. Many pertinent details of the Lincoln story are missing, but I think it was the author\u2019s intent to relate her version in light brushstrokes, and as such, it is well done. My husband\u2019s term for it is \u2018soft history\u2019. What this book does really well is whet my appetite for more...more detailed information and analysis of the Lincoln saga. Just recently I got to choose a few books from my late father\u2019s library and this was one of them. He picked up old books from flea markets all of his life and many of them show the wear and tear from readers of the past. These aged books excited him more than any brand new volume ever could. I\u2019m kind of like that myself and prefer a used book over a brand new book any day. My guess is that he didn\u2019t read this book completely through though, because he preferred hard core history, the kind of reading that only the most serious student of the past will tackle. Still, it has his beautiful flowing signature on the dedication page which delights me no end and I hope that someday his great-granddaughters will read it."}, {"userName": "Judith Hall Simon", "userReviewDate": "Jan 02, 2017", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/30759404-judith-hall-simon", "userReview": "This is historical fiction written on the young adult level, but that does not detract from this engrossing story of understanding the wife of Abraham Lincoln.
