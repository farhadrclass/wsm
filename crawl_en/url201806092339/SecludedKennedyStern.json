I'm amazed at how Kennedy has grown on me, and how I feel like I know her and her friends now. This book was a bit confusing to begin with, but it wasn't long until the story had me intrigued and I couldn't wait to find out what was going to happen next. I'm not sure if it was when I read the book, or that I was tired, or what, but for some reason I found this book a bit discombobulated, as well as being slightly creepy at times. Miss Alana still did a great job of not going into too much detail of scary/bad things while still making the book suspenseful, but despite that, for some reason I didn't like this book as much as most of the books in the series. And, it didn't make me really think things through like some of her other books did. So, I'm still glad I read it, I just didn't like it a ton. I'm looking forward to the next book in the series, though. :)"}, {"userName": "Sandra", "userReviewDate": "Jan 11, 2018", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/35503288-sandra", "userReview": "Wow - I hardly know what to say about this book in the Kennedy Series. I did finish it in one day - that's good, right? It was definitely fast moving, memorable, scary, and compelling, but was it one of my favourite Kennedy books? No.....but why? I am trying to decide. I think there was just absolutely too much happening within too short a time - too much, for me, anyway. I didn't have time to think about one danger before another danger was taking place - it literally took my breath away, and I had too many questions in the end. My mind is thinking - where was Brandy's family, Buster's family, Roger's family and why no one? Why do 'the heros' survive and others die? police investigations, murder charges, residents of Anchorage, airports, is there any way out, the likelihood of roads still being passable, just the right person arriving at the right time? It just seemed a bit too unrealistic to me. But again, I have recently been watching the news footage in California - Yes, it all could happen and more. Well done, Alana Terry! I bet you lost a bit of sleep while writing this one, and you have certainly gave us all some things to think about."}, {"userName": "Jasmine", "userReviewDate": "Mar 22, 2018", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/14933619-jasmine", "userReview": "The signs are all there...for danger!I've been a fan of the Kennedy Stern Christian Suspense series since the start, so, needless to say, I looked forward to reading Kennedy's next adventure in Alaska. Once again Alana Terry delivered a thought-provoking tale with a generous amount of danger, and, once again she took the story in a surprising, at least to me, direction. That is one of my favorite things about this series, and all of Alana Terry's books, you really do have to expect the unexpected. Secluded was such fun to read! The Alaskan landscape is vividly portrayed in a way that made me shiver a little bit as Kennedy tries to survive cataclysmic events during the coldest and darkest days in the Alaskan wilderness. Secluded was a fairly quick read, probably because I had a hard time putting it down, and a must for fans of the author and the series.(I received a copy of this book from the author. All opinions are entirely my own.)"}, {"userName": "Julie Balzum", "userReviewDate": "Jun 07, 2018", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/56059944-julie-balzum", "userReview": "Wonderful, as always. I must admit, though, that sometimes I want to just shake Kennedy and tell her to stop her dithering, but then I remember what I was like at that age and realize that Kennedy's not doing all that badly, especially considering everything she's been through. I continue to love Willow more and more with each book; we get to know more about her in this one. I find myself trying to answer all of her questions and sometimes have to remind myself that she's not real. I'm sad there's only one more book in this series."}, {"userName": "Linda Rainey", "userReviewDate": "Nov 17, 2017", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/23269085-linda-rainey", "userReview": "Another Alana Terry novel with Kennedy.Suspense grabs you and pulls you through the book as Kennedy and Willow face kidnappers,earthquake and death.The bright side to the story, romance,marriage and something else.I loved the story,the characters and recommend the book to those who love Christian suspense with a little romance."}, {"userName": "Kendall L.

Astrological signs and meteorological events have got Christians and non-Christians alike wondering if the end times are closing in. Kennedy\u2019s not going to let the media hype keep her from visiting Alaska, but her plans to spend Christmas break on her roommate\u2019s homestead are demolished when she gets stranded off-road. Seeking shelter in a secluded cabin sounds like such a good idea, but as the endless night progresses, Kennedy encounters dangers far more insidious than the freezing weather.", "title": "Secluded\n      \n          (Kennedy Stern #8)", "url": "https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/36043869-secluded", "average": 4.33, "cover": "https://images.gr-assets.com/books/1502772628l/36043869.jpg", "reviews": 7, "authors": [{"url": "https://www.goodreads.com/author/show/7048073.Alana_Terry", "name": "Alana Terry"}], "type": ["Young Adult", "Fiction"], "outlinks": ["http://www.goodreads.com/book/show/36043869-secluded", "http://www.goodreads.com/book/show/25335376-unplanned", "http://www.goodreads.com/book/show/17798886-the-beloved-daughter", "http://www.goodreads.com/book/show/27423786-paralyzed", "http://www.goodreads.com/book/show/23202955-slave-again", "http://www.goodreads.com/book/show/30296610-policed"]}
