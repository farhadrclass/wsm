I love her, she's a genius, I hope she lives forever, etc. These stories are dark and smart and completely compelling--in part because Rendell is such an incredible stylist, and in part because she has such a profound and often startling understanding of human nature. I especially noticed, in this book, her skill with unattractive narrators. The one in the title story is a great example: I could recognize his creepy nastiness, and at the same time felt drawn in (against my will) to seeing things from his point of view--so I had a deliciously complicated reaction to this story, and really to all of them."}, {"userName": "michael spencer", "userReviewDate": "Jul 19, 2014", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/173702-michael-spencer", "userReview": "Rendell is a master of her craft, and The Copper Peacock is congruent with such aptitude.

The Copper Peacock and Other Stories is a short-story collection by Ruth Rendell. The title comes from the 6th story in the collection, in which a copper bookmark in the form of a peacock is gift from a cleaner to her employer, the giving of which has significant ramifications for their relationship. The final story in the collection features her popular series Inspector Reg Wexford. The collection contains nine stories:1. A Pair of Yellow Lilies- A mousy woman takes a young lover, enticed by his angelic beauty and vividly embroidered jacket, and a subtle criminal trade-off occurs. He is not who he say he is\u20262. Paperwork \u2013 a girl is left with her grandparents by her 16-year old mother. She grows up knowing that her grandmother doesn\u2019t like her as she refers to her as \u201cthat child\u201d and \u201cit\u201d.3. Mother's Help - Murder is the theme in this story in which a handsome man enlists the unwitting aid of his two innocent children in getting rid of his two wives.4. Long Live the Queen \u2013 This story features a snarly elegant feline who finds her regal niche after another cat is killed.5. Dying Happy \u2013 a man on his deathbed wants his old mistress to come and see him one last time, but things doesn\u2019t turn out as he wanted especially when his wife is concerned. 6. The Copper Peacock - Egotist Bernard borrows a friend's flat to ensure quiet while he writes a book. Flattered by the awed, pretty maid, Judy, who tidies up and serves him exquisite lunches but arrives for work each day increasingly bruised and battered, Bernard cringes with mortification when Judy gives him an ugly but costly peacock-shaped bookmark.7. Weeds \u2013 what can I say\u2026. Things aren\u2019t always as it seems\u2026..8. The Fish-Sitter - In the ghoulish ``The Fish Sitter,'' an aquarium claims human prey.9. An Unwanted Woman (an Inspector Wexford story) - Chief Inspector Wexford, from Rendell's Kingsmarkham series, appears in ``An Unwanted Woman,'' his equanimity threatened by a spooky teenage runaway."}, {"userName": "Cameron Trost", "userReviewDate": "Mar 17, 2017", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/3912308-cameron-trost", "userReview": "A decent collection of short stories examining psychology, society, and crime. However, being used to Ruth Rendell's exceptionally high standard, I wasn't overly impressed. These are by no means her most original or well-written stories.

It isn\u2019t really a matter for the police, but the circumstances are troubling, and worsening.

It's about ten short stories, less mysteries than just creepy vignettes of people either doing or about to do evil deeds. That's where I think Rendell is so successful, at showing the series of choices that lead up to an average, everyday person choosing to do something truly horrifying. She makes murder seem humdrum in a way that manages to be relatable and never boring. Plus, the bonus at the end is a 30-page mini-Wexford."}, {"userName": "Lorna Francis", "userReviewDate": "Jul 22, 2015", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/26190968-lorna-francis", "userReview": "In these short stories Rendell shows her great ability to create memoravble characters from mad cat loving women to condescending writers who irk the reader. \u00a0I found this particular collection of nine stories mostly predictable, unsettling and the ending of some left open ended. \u00a0I am currently discouraged in reading further novels by this author. \u00a0However if you were a fan of the eighties show Tales of The Unexpected \u00a0\u00a0I am sure you will enjoy these stories."}, {"userName": "Robert", "userReviewDate": "Sep 02, 2012", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/1613217-robert", "userReview": "The Copper Peacock and Other Stories by Ruth RendellThere are nine Stories in this book .
