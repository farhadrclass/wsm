In fairness, I'll admit I'm not a fan of Victorian romances. Didn't think this was one? Ha.Here, let me save you some time:Chapter 1 to 6Cat misses her dead father, so she reads his expedition journals. Cat is cold because they can\u2019t afford heat in the big, drafty house. She is hungry because she missed breakfast. Cat is cold when she runs to school because she forgot her coat, the one in last season\u2019s style. See Cat\u2019s cousin, Bee, and \u201cbest friend\u201d pinch her during lecture. See Bee get Cat into trouble with the school proctor. See Cat risk Big Trouble to help Bee get out of a little scrape. Plus, Cat will miss lunch and she is still hungry. See Bee mock Cat for missing her dead father. See Cat and Bee hide in the library where Bee tells the reader Cat all about her dead parents. See Cat sacrifice herself for Bee.Chapter 6 to 14Cat is symbolically married off to an evil \u2018cold mage\u2019 as part of a contract. However, he is very handsome with his cute beard and besides, he\u2019s a very spiffy dresser. Too bad he makes fun of Cat\u2019s clothes! Cat is still hungry, and can\u2019t believe when the mage refuses his fish soup, lamb and chicken dishes, beans, rabbit liver, sweet potato and vegetable stews. How wasteful when Cat is so hungry! Let\u2019s talk about the food some more. Aw, the mage takes pity on Cat and lets her eat some dinner. The house is under attack! They escape out the window and through the city. Cat is still hungry but now is kind of mad. Their carriage is under attack! The coachman, a spirit in disguise, saves them. The mage makes the carriage pull over at a shrine to do something mysterious. Cat is still cold! The driver gives her his coat. The mage makes fun of her clothes again. They stop at a hotel and Cat bonds with the trolls in the front room while the mage hangs with other old dudes.Interlude: Carol goes to bed because this awful writing is giving her a headache.***************************************************************************Unfortunately for Elliot, I read the 2012 5-book edition of The Lyra Novels by Patricia Wrede shortly before starting Cold Magic. In the introduction, Wrede shares how she was afraid to workshop her first published book, Shadow Magic, with her writing workgroup after it had been accepted for publication. In this new edition, she was able to go back and re-work it. The first chapter of the original book was included, and she showed exactly what was cut, reworded and why. I wouldn\u2019t have hated the first version by any means; it was competent and familiar. However, her edits demonstrated how slightly changing narrative and deleting extraneous details could focus the story.All I could think when I first started reading Cold Magic is how much Elliot could have used Wrede\u2019s writing group. The first six chapters are essentially large swaths of setting that have nothing to do with plot advancement. To add insult, many of the infodumps are structured as dialogue between Bee and Cat in astonishingly awkward conversation. Although they\u2019ve been living together for years, in one section Bee says to Cat: \u201cPeople must eat. That\u2019s why your parents came to live with the family in Adurnam, isn\u2019t it? What else could they do? Your father had to go to work again for the family. Yet his heart wasn\u2019t in it. He fought with everyone. The reports he prepared were useless. He did not want to leave your mother and you alone, and your mother could not travel with him into those regions\u2026\u201d Even more distressingly, that particular chunk takes place on page 63. As in, not during the introduction. But don\u2019t worry: Elliot does it in the beginning pages as well.Characterization feels sadly unoriginal. Cat is the orphan, alienated by fickle disposition and excessive brains. Bee is the beautiful one everyone adores. Even more disappointingly, during the first half of the book Cat and Bee\u2019s relationship is sadly dysfunctional although Cat tells us all the time how she and Bee would do \u2018anything\u2019 for each other. I don\u2019t know yet if Elliot was doing it on purpose, but it\u2019s pretty apparent the relationship is one way. If Bee was a man, we\u2019d call her \u2018an exploitative ass.\u2019 Actually, I\u2019d call her that either way. Certainly with all the pinching, mocking, entreating, condescending and lecturing, it qualifies. I\u2019m generally against the martyr protag, and Cat\u2019s longing to be with her best friend and compadre Bee just smacked of idiocy.Character motivation annoys. I confess, I\u2019m predisposed to get stabby with the \u201cdaddy\u2019s little girl\u201d absentee-father syndrome. Cat admires her father, misses him, risks punishment as part of getting closer to him through reading his journals, yada, yada, yada. She doesn\u2019t sounds like a majority age protagonist. She sounds like every young book orphan ever, trying to discover her heritage. I found myself vaguely interested in the father, but it was wrapped in so much emotional angst, I wasn\u2019t able to read in any detail before my eyes started glazing over. Cat is childish in other ways as well. It isn\u2019t noticeable at first, because I attributed it to writer affectation, but Cat rarely refers to people by name, only by relationship to her or their position. Thus \u201cthe nanny,\u201d \u201cCook,\u201d \u201cthe governess,\u201d \u201cthe maestra,\u201d \u201cthe coachman,\u201d etc. Either it\u2019s Elliot trying to keep her writing \u2018interesting\u2019 by varying jobs with given names and titles, or Cat\u2019s a self-centered twit. Could be either. I\u2019m annoyed by both.Plot-wise, there\u2019s a whole bunch of other random bits about how Romans didn\u2019t conquer the Iberian peninsula (I think; frankly, the historical lectures were especially tedious), some vague stuff about the working class starting to rebel against the ruling class (which seems to be cold mages and seems vaguely related to industrialization), trans-ocean dirigibles, and a trip through Fairyland, where Cat discovers she is a Speshul Snowflake. Really. (Oh, and her other special skill of expert fencer is revealed). In a Q&A on Goodreads, Elliot mentions she threw in most of the ideas she was interested in/could fit in, and it shows. Believe me, it shows. Except it turns out quite a bit like The Greyfriar, only with mages instead of vampires. Or vice versa; I can\u2019t be bothered to check dates. They are both annoying pastiches based on the whole Victorian ladies and unsuitable relationships plotting.Lastly, not to be a complete meanie, but the writing is clunky. My first cringe was on page 4:\u201cUncle\u2019s exasperation was as sharp as a fire being extinguished by a blast of damp wind, but my curiosity was aflame.\u201cI think I sprained something trying to work out that image.On my blog, I rated it one and-a-half stars. Why not one star? I found the trip through fairyland interesting, even if it was rather traditional. I didn\u2019t hate it enough to completely stop, or to throw it across the room. I appreciated Elliot\u2019s attempt to be sort of multi-culti, and if she suffered from Overly Plucky Heroine, it was a vaguely interesting setting. I was puzzled by the trolls that appeared in the inn (who seemed birdlike with their feathered crests) and found myself hoping for more about the magic system. So points for inspiring reader curiosity. But overall, it felt strangely like a first novel, badly in need of a writing group."}, {"userName": "oliviasbooks", "userReviewDate": "Dec 07, 2011", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/2843533-oliviasbooks", "userReview": "[and Cat\u2019s newfound brother the easy-going, shapeshifting ladies\u2019 man Roderic  (hide spoiler)]"}, {"userName": "Sarah Mac", "userReviewDate": "Jan 16, 2011", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/4490376-sarah-mac", "userReview": "A GR friend of mine has a shelf called wtf was this. And as I closed this book for the last time, utterly defeated by the barrage of incomprehensible & unnecessary pseudo-european cultural fantasy-speak, I actually thought what the f*ck was this? Too bad I don't have a shelf like that, or I'd put this on it.I feel odd reviewing a book that i didn't finish. It might be unfair, really; other readers have claimed the book does improve in the second half. But I won't be there to see it. As much as it pains me (and really, it does; I had high expectations for this one), I'm waving the white flag. My completionist genes have been knocked for a loop. As much as any issues with the cultural & magical WTFery, I've been turned away by the characters & voice of this book. Quite simply, I'm not connecting...and I have no wish to keep trying. All I can do is compare this book to KUSHIEL'S DART, another alterna-european fantasy in first person, & think how poorly it holds up beside Jacqueline Carey's vivid & elegant narration. I can't point out the exact nature of my distaste; this voice is almost too polished, maybe. I can tell this is the work of someone with books under their belt. But that smoothness is such that it lacks personality -- it's just bland, & that's a dastardly crime indeed. (On a more technical note, COLD MAGIC reads like a YA novel...yet it's marketed as an adult fantasy. Cat certainly behaves like a YA heroine more than an adult, & that irked me.)Anyhoo...I'm not going to bend ears with a rant on the waste of alterna-european history & onslaught of cultural fantasy-speak. I have only this to say: \nIf one wants their steampunkish historical fantasy to be taken seriously, one should not include lizard people.\nYes, LIZARD PEOPLE. Ok, so technically these lizard folks aren't Gorn clones. They have feathered crests. And, apparently, some of them work as solicitors in London (Londun) proper. And they face cultural discrimination or something like that...I dunno, really. By that point I was still trying to wrap my mind around Gorn-the-lawyer.Kirk...your legal feessss are three monthssss overdue.Clearly this book just wasn't for me. Ah well.

Some parts, such as the dream of the dragon, the bits with the illusions and the cold steel, and especially the alternate history of Europe right up to the Regency era, with all of the Napoleanic (Camjiata) flavors built right in, even going far back for the world-building to the great empire of Carthage, the Phoenicians.Like I said, there's a lot to love.Unfortunately, there's also the bad.Andevai has got to be one of the most atrociously horrible character I've ever read. Not only do I learn to hate him right off the bat, but there's almost no good points to latch onto besides a little illusion of Catherine in his hands or the fact that he apparently, grudgingly, did the right thing later in the tale. I did not get the feeling that he was supposed to be Catherine's love interest even if she told us, also grudgingly, that he was handsome. I was not sold. No. Nope. Nada. Nilch. Or zilch if you prefer. However you want to say it, he is No Darcy. I mean... \"Oh goodie he loves me, now I can forget that he treated me like crap, repeatedly, hunted me, tried to kill me, was shamed by his family and betrayed his master, albeit for me. Woopie. He did the right thing and seems to hate me for it. Oh, yeah, of course he's my true husband.\" Right.That's just the worst of it, but unfortunately, I also had some problems with the flow of the text. I didn't mind how dense it was, in general, but when I start wondering why we're still in this scene and it seems rather directionless at the beginning and a good handful of times throughout, then I had to put the book down and read something else. I don't like doing that. I rarely ever want to, even.There's a lot of good promise in the book, though. I just wish it had been written by someone else. Or with better editing. Or maybe a good couple of beta readers that could have sat down and said that a good deal of better foreshadowing might have fixed it or that a slightly less traditional wrap-up to the core story might have been quite, quite welcome after having us work so hard to get through the text.I dislike being this cruel to a book. Seriously. It's nothing personal. I generally love to read. I just wish I could have loved this one more and not so sporadically."}, {"userName": "Felicia", "userReviewDate": "Sep 11, 2010", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/666892-felicia", "userReview": "I wrote a really long review and somehow it got erased just as I was about to press \"post.\" Is it because it's Monday? Jeeeez.Ok, AS I WAS SAYING, this book was between 3 and 4 stars for me, but I gave it 4 because at the end of the book I was really satisfied and wanted more. I really really enjoyed Cold Magic, I liked the female protagonist a lot and the mystery behind the book and the politics of the world. Only negative: the world-building slogged down the pace in places though because there is A LOT GOING ON. Steampunk/magic/politics/romance/swordfighting/fairies etc etc etc. I mean, this is an invention of a whole 'nother type of fantasy world, which I really admire, but some passages just felt a little slow because there was a lot of 'splainin' to do. A map and extended glossary would have helped (one thing a Kindle sucks at, flipping back and forth to stuff like that!)That said, I'm definitely signed up for this series, it had a great epic-fantasy quality feel with an interesting female lead.

Check!Great characters: Headstrong young lady who has been sadly misinformed about herself for most of her life, and a Harlequin-worthy hatemance with the spoiled Cold Mage she's forced to marry and who is Not All What He Seems. Check!But on the other hand--Plot: Hello, yoo-hoo, plot? Where are you? Look at the cover blurb:\"Young Cat Barahal thinks she understands the world she lives in and her place in it, but in fact she is merely poised, unaware, on the brink of shattering events. Drawn into a labyrinth of politics involving blood, betrayal and old feuds, she will be forced to make an unexpected and perilous journey in order to discover the truth, not just about her own family but about an ancient secret lying at the heart of her world.\" Okay, that's nice, BUT WHAT IS THE PLOT. HOW DO WE GO FROM A TO B. IS THERE EVEN AN A TO B. TELL ME BOOK.Wait, you're too busy worldbuilding. Sorry, I'll let you get back to that. And the worldbuilding. Oi. The worldbuilding.I like worldbuilding. I like new, fresh, innovative takes on old tropes. That's why Sabriel is placed on an altar in my apartment and periodically worshiped. The major problem with building a whole huge world and spending a lot of thought and braincells on building this whole really cool world, including food, politics, and a culture is that you want to show people that you spent a lot of time and braincells on it. Which leads to infodumps. This is the reason why I can't get through the Lord of the Rings trilogy (I know, I know, I'm a Philistine). The man put a lot of thought into the worldbuilding. And he shows it. I gave up when he spent like a page describing a CHAIR. I DON'T CARE ABOUT THE CHAIR. I'M SURE IT'S A VERY NICE CHAIR. BUT DO SOMETHING NOW, OK?Cold Magic likes to infodump. Not only does it like to infodump, but it has the main character do it in the narration. The way it's done is so jarring that I kept getting thrown out of the story. The effect was rather like jogging straight into a brick wall every twenty feet or so.Because the plot (when it's THERE) moves fast. There is action! Cat is constantly going from one place to the other, stuff keeps happening, blowing up, SEKRITS BEING REVEALED and oh wait BRICK WALL more infodump about the world, ow my head.This would not be nearly as frustrating as it is if the plot and premise and characters weren't so interesting. Leaving me to have to force my way through the walls o' information. I feel like the book could have been served with less infodump about the world and more plot. Again, I hold up Sabriel as the example. It's obvious A LOT of worldbuilding went into the thing, but Nix only used as much as he needed to tell the story. You know there's a lot more going on there, but he cleverly gives us enough to get the job done and moves on (Which only leaves me slavering for more, 2013 get here NOW). J.K. Rowling did the same thing with Harry Potter, she knows a LOT more than what she put in the books, but used only enough to tell the story.The other major problem I had was the prose. It seemed like there were a few large SAT-worthy words sprinkled into the prose that also felt jarring. I understand that Cat is an educated young lady who is obsessed with her scholar father's journals, and might throw in a few rando big words into her narration, but it just didn't feel right. And there's nothing wrong with using the thesaurus-mighty words, as long as they fit. The way it was done in Cold Magic these words interrupted the flow of the prose. A lot like the infodumps got in the way of the story. This is the first book in a trilogy, and thus we probably need all the information being thrown at us to get the story. I just wish it had been integrated a bit better into the story, instead of ACTION! infodump ACTION! infodump! ACTION ACTION ACTION infodump! Jog jog jog BRICK WALL. Give us enough to understand the next bit and move on, we'll keep following because we NEED TO KNOW MORE OMG.This is not a bad book. It's a good book that is also very frustrating. I'll be reading the second book because I do like the all the ideas and the strong characters. I just sincerely hope that the infodumps are a lot smoother the second go-round."}, {"userName": "Rusty's Ghost Engine (also known as..........

This is not a story to be rushed it has to be savored and analysed to get the full experience. The novel is set in an alternate early 19th century europa that still has fragments of the ice age and magic and the spirit world are real and well known. After the fall of the Roman empire the regional princes and nobility ruled their areas but were still influenced by the somewhat regional mage houses who gained power when people from the sahara area were driven from their land by a plague of ghouls that were released when digging too far in the salt mines. These people had sorcerers who led them safely north across the desert to Europa where they met the celtic drua of the north and together they formed the mage houses. There is just too much complex history for me to go into here but I will say the world was richly crafted and described especially the spirit world scenes.The things I liked were the world building (like I said), the characters and the reveals toward the end. One of the things that intrigued me so was this whole idea of dragons controlling the natural forces of the mortal and spirit worlds by dreaming and shifting in their sleep. I wanted to know more about this ability to \"walk the dreams of dragons\" and what exactly it meant and it would also be interesting to learn more of Cats heritage and why she has a spirit mantle and what her brother actually is. The idea of the wild hunt was also really interesting as I'm sure I've heard that name before but not known what it is. It turns out the wild hunt kills or carries away those who have drawn the attention of the night or day courts, the courts that rule the spirit world..The characters were well developed and complex and I loved seeing how they evolved throughout the book. I know she is the MC but I really got on well with Cat. I could really sympathize with her situation when she discovered her whole life was a lie and I liked her quick wits and determination. She is a strong character who will do anything to protect those she loves and survive. The things I didn't like that much were the slow pacing. I can't really say how but I thought this novel could have moved along faster. There was a lot of descriptions of average things so maybe things could have been edited down a little? The ending also felt a little unbelievable and unclear regarding the mage houses desire to control Bee the girl who walked the dreams of dragons I knew they were guarding her but afterwards the girls went to seek legal help with old friends while also meeting the very man those in power want to stop. It would seem that everyone powerful on both sides is going to start fighting over the power to get the girls to do their bidding. I really hope this series is not going to turn into political ramble like Golden Son... I really hope this series will focus more on the fantasy side of things and I would really like to know more about the spirit world courts and the dragons...This is how I envisioned one of the dragons (representing the forces of ice and winter and perhaps cold magic even though the cold mages were said to get their power through the spirit world) after looking at my front cover of this book..I would recommend this book to those who are looking for a really complex alternate history/fantasy book. Anyone who likes rich culture and history along with strong characters would like this but on saying that there is a lot of patience needed with this book due to the pacing and all..."}, {"userName": "Alex Fayle", "userReviewDate": "May 08, 2011", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/5399824-alex-fayle", "userReview": "Kate Elliott\u2019s Cold Magic is about as slippery as dress shoes on ice. But fortunately without the painful fall.Why is it slippery? Because it\u2019s (as Elliott describes it) a mashup novel.When I started reading I decided it was a magic-riddled steampunk novel. Then I decided it was also a political novel (exploring cultural beliefs using an alternate Europe). But no sooner had I decided that when Elliott threw in an \u201cI hate him with all my heart\u201d romance in the best Harlequin tradition. Later, once I had accepted the three themes, seemingly for fun, Elliott tossed in a coming-of-age story colored by who-am-I changeling motifs. At this point I was sliding around so much in the various plots that I\u2019m convinced that there are other novels hidden inside Cold Magic that I didn\u2019t see.In other words, it\u2019s a mess of a novel. Oh and it\u2019s long. Very long. It\u2019s also full of physical detail, whole sections of alternate history lessons and worldbuilding summaries.It should be a disaster. I shouldn\u2019t have made it past the first addition of complexity. I like my stories simple, plot oriented and on the shorter side. I hate book bloat (yes, looking at you Harry Potter Book 4).And yet I loved it, so much that I was momentarily angry with Elliott for abandoning me at the end, just as the main character and I were getting some answers.I\u2019ve heard (can\u2019t remember where) that the twenty-first century\u2019s only original contribution to culture is the mashup (a nice piece of irony that \u2013 the only thing new isn\u2019t new at all). If that\u2019s true, then Elliott demonstrates that she\u2019s one of the Mashup Movement\u2019s masters.Every single thing that she \u201cshouldn\u2019t\u201d have done should have blocked my slide through the book (such as the passages of history stuck into the thoughts of the main character, or the use of description and details that seemed to have nothing to do with the plot), but as I glided along screen after screen I marveled at how well she had done it. Cold Magic is a great example of a book that breaks the rules of conventional fantasy and yet succeeds for the skill with which it\u2019s done.This isn\u2019t a Hollywood blockbuster hitting us over the head again and again with its action scenes and overarching lesson. It\u2019s a European period piece that lets the reader decide what to get out of the slippery messages the story contains. (Not that it doesn\u2019t have action scenes, because it does aplenty \u2013 written with dexterity, of course)."}, {"userName": "Krystle", "userReviewDate": "Jun 03, 2010", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/2639204-krystle", "userReview": "I\u2019ve held off on this review for long enough, haven\u2019t I? Well, let\u2019s get started then. Cold Magic is fabulous! I think the strongest part of the book is the world building. There is great depth and complexity woven through it, created with a great deal of intricate thought. Not only is there an established rank of classes with all its ensuing ramifications (prejudice, the dynamic between the rich and the poor, etc), careful economic considerations (what makes the poor, poorer and what makes the rich, richer, and what the society revolves around), and the complicated battle between science and magic. Or you can take this as an upgraded version of Victorian society which is what the alternate history in this book is based off of.Also, the author has created a diverse world of many ethnicities, Cat herself being one, and of course, also, Andevai, the male protagonist. But there are many more allusions in the book. It\u2019s awesome. I can totally envision this world as being real and dropping myself in it. The relationships are also a fantastic high point of the book. I love how close Cat and her cousin, Bee, are in here. They might only be cousins but they were raised almost as sisters and it\u2019s wonderful to see how devoted and loyal they are to both each other no matter what nasty things they encounter along the way. It\u2019s refreshing to see that they keep their love for each other strong and don\u2019t go the way of misunderstandings, misconceptions, and what not to make them vilify the other like some stories do. Ah, I can\u2019t forget about the romance. Aha, that got your interest did it? It\u2019s actually very subtle and not very prominent in that the focus of the novel shifts away from the main plot to build up their love-love times. I\u2019m quite happy about that. This is no insta-lust/love. It takes them quite a while to grow into their feelings for each other. Mainly because Cat is headstrong and stubborn, but determined, while Andevai is arrogant, detached, and riddled with a superiority complex because of his magical schooling. He is cool to her and not at all friendly but it\u2019s very understandable once you understand the reasons behind his behavior. I\u2019m sure I would behave the same way.I don\u2019t know why people call this book steampunk, because it\u2019s not really. Except for one instance of a dirigible there really isn\u2019t anything else concrete to make it a steampunk book. Especially since this world is based on/firmly grounded in magic and not on steam-powered creations. Maybe we\u2019ll see more of the steampunk side in the later books, but this is firmly in the fantasy genre for me.Sometimes the world building does tend to overshadow the narrative at times but the pace of this book is fast and addictive, you won\u2019t really mind it all that much. I\u2019m really curious, though, if Andevai is stated as being cold all the time due to his magic, is he like some\u2026 popsicle all the time? Because that is not very\u2026 attractive. Haha. But other than that, there are few qualms I have with this book.This is one of the few books I can see straddling the crossover boundary. It\u2019s not quite YA (she\u2019s 19), but not yet adult. It\u2019s firmly in the middle. A rare breed if I do say so myself.I love this book! I can\u2019t wait for the next one!"}, {"userName": "Paradoxical", "userReviewDate": "Jan 26, 2011", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/1964421-paradoxical", "userReview": "The beginning of Cold Magic was both slow and felt rather cumbersome, and while I did not precisely struggle to read it, I was more than ambivalent about it. There are reasons for this. The world building has to begin and the author balances a delicate line between too much detail and exposition and not enough (well, like all fantasy novels). I wouldn't say that it was clumsily done, but it was a little heavy. I found myself at turns confused and then enlightened and then confused once more, but once all of the preliminary setting is laid out, then the book really hits its stride and I found myself enjoying it. I found that Cat, the main character, was someone I liked very much. She's a little impulsive and hotheaded, but she does her best to try to temper it without smothering herself. She makes mistakes, but she tries her best in just about impossible conditions, and she does it without going 'woe is me' all of the time. She's a strong character. But who really interested me (I can't say 'liked', since I like Cat better [I pretty much always like main characters best], but he is fascinating in his own right) was Andevai. What was best about him was the slow progression of his character, that as time went on he became more... not fleshed out, exactly (because that would mean that he was poorly characterized in the beginning), but more familiar to the reader, and so we understood more of what is going on in his mind. You read the book and you understand more about him and it's very skillfully done that you don't get whiplash from 'cold arrogant jerk' to, well, still a cold, arrogant jerk, but someone with more depth to him. It was fascinating seeing him evolve, and learning more about him as Cat learns more about him. The plot is skillfully done. It races along the pages and you find yourself tense when Cat is, and relaxed when she is (though, yes, that doesn't happen as often as she'd like, heh). The character Rory is great, I feel compelled to give him a great giant squeeze of a hug, and I love the addition that he made. What is perhaps one of the best bits is Cat's relationship with her cousin Beatrice, and how strong it is. They love each other and would do whatever they can to protect each other, and it's a relationship that does not flounder, but only grows stronger.

There still appears to be enough of an ice age that the Mediterranean is small and there's no English Channel and the middle of Europe is still glacier-bound. Also historically, with no Christianity, and an extant Roman Empire that didn't defeat Carthage and didn't collapse so much as retreat. There's also a large population of people of African descent living in Europe because of a historical disaster that overtook the northern part of that continent (a ghoul plague). And of course, multiple sapient races including the owl-like Trolls who are the natives of the North American continent as well as elemental magic.What this leaves in 1834 in this world is a racially-diverse version of Europe without racism and sexism greatly reduced from what we would think of in this time. (Women soldiers, women in universities, etc). Where there is some pretty extreme sexism, like in the mage society, it's seen as archaic and horrible. Society is also interesting, in that while it is superficially a lot like England in the mid-1800s, it is so with small groups of nobility and mage-houses acting almost feudal but with also a strong merchant class and a quickly rising industrial revolution.I haven't talked about the magic system or the spirit world. Or the story. That's because the world-building is so dominant; it's basically kitchen-sink work. At every point you're learning more and comparing and contrasting with the history of our own world. It's probably at once the novel's greatest strength and it's biggest problem.Catherine and Beatrice Hassi Barahal (\"Cat\" and \"Bee\") are cousins raised as sisters by Bee's parents because Cat's parents drowned during a river crossing. One day, not long before their majority at 20 a cold mage named turns up at their house and claims ownership of the oldest Barahal daughter, which is Cat. Bee's parents are obviously upset, but they acknowledge his claim and tell her to go with him immediately. Only cold mages are pretty much feared and despised and this one, Andevai, seems to live up to their reputation as cold, aloof and arrogant. But Cat has abilities that no one expects. Which comes in handy, because it turns out that Bee's parents have deliberately given the cold mages the wrong daughter and for them to get the right daughter Cat must first die.I found the story compelling although not so much as the world-building. What I didn't appreciate so much was what I felt was some really clunky writing. There were numerous paragraphs where I had to reread because of clarity issues and mixed metaphors or just plain poor wording. I wish I'd taken notes on some of them so I could give examples, but frankly, there's a lot of book here and I was more interested on pushing through it.Despite issues, I had the strong urge to start the next one immediately, so that tells me the things I liked about it far outweighed my problems with it."}, {"userName": "Krbo", "userReviewDate": "Jun 17, 2015", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/20371267-krbo", "userReview": "\"Roman epske fantastike u kojem se znanost i magija blablabla....\"Bljak!Evo dva citata da odmah shvatite o kakvoj se \"epskoj fantastici\" radi:1:\"Poljubac mo\u017ee biti kao okretaj svijeta.

As the result of a family obligation, Catherine Hassi Barahal is forced into an arranged marriage to a young noble, an enigmatic cold mage. She is immediately torn away from her home and her education in the technology of the impending industrial age, only to find that marriage into a mage house is far from safe or secure. Cat is thrust into a world where magic and science naturally conflict, and the mysteries of her family\u2019s past tie her to the forces of revolution.A (surprisingly) likeable protagonistI was concerned that I wouldn\u2019t connect with Cat, Cold Magic\u2019s young, female protagonist. Fortunately, Elliott\u2019s delightful storytelling effortlessly breached my cynicism. Cat is a vulnerable and conflicted heroine who is able to find the strength to endure her circumstances\u2014she is not the typical strong female with token weaknesses. This distinction is vital because Cold Magic is essentially a coming of age story. There is uncertainty over the motives of Cat\u2019s deceased father, and she is confused about her unusual link with the spirit world and what implications that bears upon her heritage. Cat\u2019s growing understanding of her identity is intricately tied to the epic and world-shaping events that unfold as the story continues.As in many fantasy tales, our heroine is initially aware of the forces that exist in her world, but is in no way enmeshed in them. After a few chapters, the scale of events and the sense of urgency in the narrative ramps up drastically, but it makes sense! Cat\u2019s transition from student to endangered heroine happens rapidly and unpredictably, but still believably. I was hooked. Other characters display similarly genuine motivations, and relationships endure realistic complications with no convenient resolution of fractures.A certain level of qualityCold Magic is undoubtedly a book produced by an experienced and professional author at the top of her game. Elliott makes subtle use of fantasy tropes to create red herrings which probably exist as much in the mind of the reader as on the page. The layering of the narrative is so clever that even those who feel that the story best suits young adult readers will be sucked in by the quality of the story telling. The complications that propel Cat into high stakes events frequently caught me off guard. In fact, I regularly had my expectations overturned by Cold Magic\u2019s intertwining mysteries.A touch of the historicalElliott effortlessly builds a detailed alternate history through the action and characters without ever resorting to tedious information dumps. The point of historical divergence is Rome\u2019s failure to defeat the Carthaginians at Zama, coupled with a prolonged ice age. This event has genuine geo-political ramifications. The world doesn\u2019t continue on otherwise untouched, and other events that bear similarities to our history also play out differently. The Roman Empire lasted hundreds of years longer and is still influential in Cold Magic\u2019s 19th Century setting. There was no real Dark Age, presumably due to ongoing empire and the existence of magic. The eponymous \u2018cold magic\u2019 derives from a mysterious combination of Celtic druidism and African shamanism, brought to Europa with the refugees from a \u2018ghoul plague\u2019 in North Africa. By the time Cold Magic begins, Europa is itself recovering from an attempted revolution led by the general Camjiata.Taking steampunk to the next levelOne of the major themes of Cold Magic is the clash of industry and magic. Technological advancement, theoretically irrelevant in a world with magic, exists because the cold mages aren\u2019t particularly eager to share their gift. In fact, the Mage Houses lord it over the people. The cold mages actively seek to cripple and hold back industrial revolution. Elliott brilliantly sets these forces up as diametric opposites \u2013 cold mages literally extinguish fires, including those of industrial furnaces, by their mere presence. The imagery is simple but powerful.Why should you read this book?Cold Magic is a fun and engaging tale from a great storyteller. As a teacher, I would happily recommend Cold Magic to my school librarian. I would also recommend it to my 30 year old friends with equal confidence. With the book available in paperback and the sequel due in weeks, treat yourself to a delightful tale."}, {"userName": "YouKneeK", "userReviewDate": "Nov 09, 2016", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/25923230-youkneek", "userReview": "Several years ago, I read this author\u2019s Crossroads trilogy, beginning with Spirit Gate. My memory of it is really fuzzy, but I remember it as being a fairly complex story, with multiple points-of-view and storylines. I also remember that I really enjoyed it, and I\u2019ve wanted to try some of her other books.This book was a little different from what I expected based on my fuzzy memory of Crossroads. I enjoyed the story and the characters, but there were some aspects of the writing that seemed amateur to me, and I also felt like the story was written for a younger audience. The \u201cyounger audience\u201d aspect probably would have been less of an issue for me if I hadn\u2019t expected something more adult, and it was also partly explained by the author\u2019s Acknowledgments at the end of the book. As it turns out, she had collaborated on the story with her three children who were in high school at the time. This doesn\u2019t explain some of my complaints with the writing, though, since she did all of the writing herself. I briefly wondered if this book was one of her earlier works, but it was in fact published a little bit later than the final Crossroads book.The setting is kind of interesting, set in an odd alternate version of our world in which there are both mages and an industrial revolution. I\u2019m going to be vague about the story line, because it\u2019s a bit of a slow build-up and I don\u2019t want to spoil any surprises. Cold Magic is told from the first-person perspective of Cat, a nineteen-year-old girl whose parents were killed in an accident when she was six. She\u2019s been raised, and well-treated, in the home of her aunt and uncle where she has a great relationship with her similarly-aged cousin, Bee. Cat has some special abilities, and one of her only memories of her mother is her warning Cat not to ever tell anybody what she can do. So there\u2019s a bit of a mystery about Cat\u2019s past, but mostly she just lives her life as a normal girl. Until everything changes, of course. :) One night a visitor shows up at Cat\u2019s home to demand that a certain bargain be upheld.One of the main reasons I thought this was an earlier work was because the author used dialogue clumsily, particularly in the beginning, to convey background information. The dialogue was usually well-written and interesting, but there were several passages that completely dragged me out of the story because it was just too obvious. For example, at one point Cat is pretty much lectured by Bee on her own life history. People just don\u2019t talk like that. When they have shared stories and histories, they use shorthand. They would say, \u201cRemember that time in the elevator?\u201d as opposed to, \u201cRemember that time in the elevator when [long monologue about a story both parties already know]?\u201d. Another one of my complaints is about the romance. Fortunately it\u2019s a bit sparse and doesn\u2019t overwhelm the story, but I did think it was very obvious from the beginning how the relationship would develop. It was also pretty unrealistic, such as the random \u201coh wow, look at those lips, I really want to kiss him\u201d (I\u2019m paraphrasing!) thoughts at absolutely ridiculous moments. The friendship between Cat and Bee, on the other hand, was very well done. I also really enjoyed the character of Rory and his interaction with Cat.The story has a little bit of repetitiveness and a few excessively coincidental occurrences, but mostly I did enjoy the story. We\u2019re given several questions at the beginning and then the answers are slowly revealed while giving us more questions along the way, and I enjoyed speculating about the answers. This is the first book in a trilogy, so it doesn\u2019t wrap up all of the story lines, but we do get answers to some of the major questions by the end. There\u2019s an interesting, if not terribly surprising, twist near the end that sets the stage for the next book and I look forward to seeing what will happen next. I\u2019m giving this 3.5 stars on BookLikes, but rounding up to 4 on Goodreads."}, {"userName": "Nafiza", "userReviewDate": "Sep 17, 2010", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/2483439-nafiza", "userReview": "I don't often find a book I want to read again after the first initial inhalation of its story and characters. I don't want to pore over events that shape the narrative, linger over the words spoken and the feelings felt by the different characters. It's a rare book that engages me to the extent that I will read and reread because every time I do, I find something more to take away from it.Cold Magic, the first book in the Spirit Walker trilogy, is one such rare book. I found myself reading as slowly as I could so that the pleasure that came from reading it would last a longer time. And when I did finish the book, I immediately went and looked up the author to see when the next installment is coming out because I don't know if I can wait until it does and...well, there is no release date yet. Boo.Cold Magic fascinates because of the detail with which the alternate world is created. The history, the people, the mythos - it is all so exquisitely detailed that the reader will find herself swept away with it but at the same time, in some detached manner, breathless at the superb skill of the author. The story is not built on a shaky foundation which is loosened by a logical question or attempts at reason. It is solidly woven, binding together different parts of the world to create a gorgeous tapestry, a setting in which the wonderful characters of the book can exist.There are two women: Cat and Bee. Girls, really. Both twenty. Usually when you have two characters, there is a lack of balance between them. One is deemed more important than the other. It is a testament to Ms. Elliot's writing that despite the story being told in the first person (Cat), Bee is just as much intriguing and an equally strong character as Cat. Neither of them are perfect but both have been characterized in a manner that transcends their otherworldliness and makes them relatable to the ordinary reader curled up by a fireplace (or not). The other characters are just as strongly hewn. Their individuality, whether they are present for a chapter or two, is very present. I've said it before, side characters and their characterizations are very important to the success of a novel and Ms. Elliot delivers wonderfully on those counts. The romance is surprising with its presence and all the more compelling for its element of unexpectedness.Another strength of the novel comes from its pacing. The entire novel is like a race. Tensions increase as the finish line is approached, the sense of danger skitters across your skin and you (no matter how much you try not to) read as fast as you can in desperation to see what happens next. The story has many layers, it's a complex interweaving of different dynasties, different times and different hopes. It is unpredictable to its last page and I'm so running out of superlatives right now.This was a brilliant premise to what promises to be an awesome trilogy. If you are interested in steam-punk, strong heroines, friendship and sizzling romance, read this. Even if you aren't interested in any of those things, read this anyway. It's too good to miss."}, {"userName": "Allison", "userReviewDate": "Dec 06, 2012", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/9371994-allison", "userReview": "Cold Magic is an alternate history fantasy, but unlike any I\u2019ve read before. It takes place in England in the 1800s - I think, since there isn\u2019t really an England or a Victoria as far I can tell. Some aspects of both Regency and Victorian society are there, including an alternate Industrial Revolution. All of Europe is still frozen in an extended ice age. There are mage houses and princes in conflict with serving classes and technology, and there is just a tiny bit of steampunkishness to it - there\u2019s an airship, but that\u2019s about it so far. There are still Romans running around and Latin is still a spoken language, although their empire was defeated about 800 years earlier. There are also Carthaginians who have become a clan of spies, and a Napolean-like liberator who is imprisoned on an island. A version of America is hinted at - oh, and there are trolls! Trolls are apparently sentient descendants of another species that didn\u2019t die out, just as there are still wooly rhinos in this world. It is fascinating, and also cold. You can really feel the cold. Honestly, the world-building was one of the worst info dumps I\u2019ve read in a long while even though the world is an imaginative one. I had to concentrate so hard for the first half to try to absorb all of the altered names and altered countries, wars, history, etc. It was almost harder having slightly familiar events than a completely new world would have been because my mind was trying to translate everything and register all the changes. And it was mostly conveyed through conversations. It was rough, but there was just enough atmosphere and interest in the main character to keep me ploughing through it, and I was glad I stuck with it in the end.Once things started really happening, I kept being surprised by the turns events took. My expectations were constantly challenged as the story went off in new directions and unexpected adventures. I also started to put together how the world - and magic - worked in real situations and what parts of the history were important for understanding the immediate story. I don\u2019t know how, but once the plot started moving, this world got under my skin and I found myself wanting to get back to it while I was at work, and wanting to pick up the sequel without taking a break. Strange. It's not easy to get into and is not without its faults once you do, but I do recommend it if you enjoy a bit of a challenge, as well as alternate history / steampunk sort of fantasies.If only the world-building had been less like being buried under a mountain of foreign terms!

Sort of like a child who decided to wear all of his or hers best clothes at once. The result is cute for a while, but if done repeatedly it starts to grate. The characters were rather like walking encyclopedias full of nonsensical information that did little to further the story line. Also, this book suffered from the \"world-wright syndrome\" that is so common in the fantasy genre, it has a great deal of world building and plot, but the story line is rather weak. Worst of all, the denouement felt rushed, just as we started to actually get to know the characters motivations and have them be something other than an outline, the book ends; which is another reason why I gave this book a one star rating. It is unpardonable for authors to do this to their readers, every book must stand on their own and have a complete story line.

This is due, in large part, to the originality of her worldbuilding; and I mean that as a compliment. Being as I am a devout mythology and history geek and also a lifelong fantasist, there are certain narrative cues to which my interests make me sensitive. When a fantasy author borrows from particular human cultures, like ancient Egypt, or from known myth-forms, like the Norse tradition \u2013 and more, if they do so with the intention that a similarly well-versed audience will be able to note the relationship, and appreciate it \u2013 the way I read their stories changes. Automatically, I infer background details about the world, the society, the religion, which is less presumptuous than it is natural, because to a certain extent, that\u2019s what I should be doing. Rather than explaining every little thing, the author is allowing me to fill in the gaps with my own knowledge, which in turn allows them to get on with the business of telling a good story. The first Kate Elliott series I encountered was Crown of Stars, which, while featuring several original societies, took place primarily in a more familiar medieval setting, albeit one shaped with certain fascinating and significant alterations. The point of mentioning this is that, when the first Crossroads book came out, I more or less assumed that its worldbuilding, too, would contain comparable levels of familiarity to Crown of Stars, and that I would therefore be able to navigate the narrative in my usual fashion, strengthening my grasp on what the characters were doing and where they were headed by comparing the rules of their world to what I know of ours. What actually happened was that I found myself in a setting completely outside my experience, blind to the sorts of cues which, had they been anchored in a mythos comparable (say) to that of ancient Rome, I would have pounced on in a heartbeat. Not only was I unable to predict the actions of the characters or the twists of the plot, but I couldn\u2019t piece together the shape of the higher magical story. A sidenote at this point, by way of demonstration: consider the average vampire novel. In this day and age, an author can reasonably assume that, if they drop hints about a character who is pale, unfond of direct sunlight and possessed of a tendency to stare at necks, their audience will think, vampire. There is no tension on our behalf as to this fact, even if the characters are, of necessity, slower to catch on. But imagine you, the reader, had never heard of a vampire. The hints would still be there, but harder to spot; without having a creature in mind possessed of all three traits to signal that this was a cluster of important facts, you could easily be forgiven for dismissing certain pertinent information \u2013 such as the paleness \u2013 as mere background detail, there to flesh things out, but not, of itself, significant. Given the current popularity of fantasy stories, particularly urban fantasy, even non-mythologists use their knowledge of certain monster-and-magic types to guide them through each successive story.Kate Elliott\u2019s writing is unique to my experience, in that she can borrow from known cultures, mythologies and settings and yet reinvent them so completely that the reader is, utterly and truly, transported to a new world. From the smallest social details to the higher magical, social and political destinies of her characters, Elliott challenges her readers to work without the usual safety nets. Which is why, midway through the second Crossroads book, I suddenly realised that everything I\u2019d been assuming about the world was wrong, because \u2013 shamefully \u2013 I had been dismissing relevant information out of a self-inflicted inability to recognise it as such. The Crossroads mythology was so different to anything I\u2019d read before that even when presented, time and again, with the key stories about the gods and their behaviours, I failed to make the connection between those invented myths and the hints as to their significance strewn throughout the plot and actions of the characters. I was being a lazy reader; I was not paying attention. By the end of the second book, I\u2019d made up my mind: before embarking on the third, I\u2019d have to read the first two again \u2013 only this time, I\u2019d keep my eyes open and refrain from making assumptions.Which brings me to Cold Magic, the first volume in the new Spiritwalker trilogy. The setting is an alternate past-history Earth, but with so many inventive differences that any attempt at trying to intuit the shape of the narrative on that basis simply won\u2019t work. There is something utterly fascinating about being dropped into a world to which one feels an automatic sense of ownership \u2013 it is still Earth, no matter how altered, therefore I should still comprehend how it works \u2013 and realising that, actually, no. Elliott has a gift for detail: instead of leaning on turns of phrase appropriate to our own reality, her narrator is provided with ample world-appropriate alternatives, so that, even where we might deem one new saying to be the equivalent of a particular old one, we are still forced to consider its meaning anew. Small social niceties and behaviours are observed by the characters, but we must learn these, too, such as the fact that shaking hands is considered a politically radical way of greeting someone else, because of the equality such a tactile gesture implies. There are flashes of known mythological concepts, particularly as relates to Celtic traditions, but renamed and altered so skilfully that even trying to compare them to the Earth originals doesn\u2019t quite work, because the new names have properly come to mean something quite different. Elliott has described the work as a mash-up, which it technically is, but also, in a more literal sense, isn\u2019t. Despite the disparate elements drawn together to build the world, the story, the society, its peoples and their magics, there are no stitches in evidence at the juncture of this and that. The skin of the whole is smooth and unblemished, the gait fluid, the eyes sharp, and what the tongue seeks to describe, it does not miss.Narrated by Catherine Hassi Barahal, known as Cat, the eldest daughter of a Kena\u2019ani family, who are also called Phoenecians, the story follows her travails after the aunt and uncle by whom she has been raised are forced to hand her over in marriage to a haughty cold mage. Cat\u2019s world is shaped by the struggles of an industrial civilisation: common folk are rebelling against their masters, both magical and political, desiring to change society through new technologies such as rifles and airships, which the cold mages despise. The political landscape is fraught with ancient tensions, too: old Roman lies about the nature of Phoenecians, the history of the mage Houses, and the comparatively recent uprising of Camjiata, a would-be emperor whose defeat and subsequent island imprisonment are reminiscent of Napoleon\u2019s captivity on Elba. Separated from her beloved cousin, Bee, Cat is forced not only to consider her own place in this world, but her options in navigating its dangers, whether through her cold mage husband, the laws of the Europan principalities, the writings of her father\u2019s diaries, or the revolutionary words of radicals. Cold Magic is an incredible novel that blends questions of culture, society and humanity with enthralling mythologies, heated politics and strong, compelling characters: in other words, it was written by Kate Elliott, and you should go read it. Now."}, {"userName": "Meg", "userReviewDate": "Nov 10, 2011", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/6408358-meg", "userReview": "COLD MAGIC is a fantastic cross-genre epic, bringing together themes from epic fantasy, romantic fantasy, steampunk, and alternative history to snare readers for hours. I was 100% sucked into this world, reading the first two 500+ page installments in less than a week. If the third was available, I\u2019d be reading that one right now too!Catherine Hassi Barahal is a young woman raised in a family known for its skill as merchants of information...in other words, spies. She\u2019s trained to use a blade and keep secrets both for her family, but more importantly for herself. Born with unheard of abilities to disappear in plain site, hear beyond human ability, and see in the dark, Catherine is very much the Cat that everyone calls her. But her most important secret is one that even she doesn\u2019t know. When the cold mage comes to claim her, Cat is drawn into a chaotic adventure that slowly reveals the truth about her history and lays the path of the future.Characters: ***** 5 StarsI adored the characters in COLD MAGIC. Cat is fully believable, and someone that I would probably be great friends with if I ever met her in person. She\u2019s feisty and talks too much, but she\u2019s also loyal, hard-working, and has a vulnerable core that endeared her to me. Her cousin, Beatrice (Bee), is similarly well-rounded. Also loyal, Bee is a much better actress and knows how to use her feminine charms to get what she wants. The two together make a perfect team. Meanwhile, the cold mage, Andevai (Vai), is just what he sounds: cold. He\u2019s haughty and rude, paying little attention to the physical needs and emotional turmoil of his hapless bride. However, every once in awhile, you get a glimpse of the real man underneath the cold mask, and by the end of the book I have to admit I was rooting for him.Plot: **** 4 StarsBetrayed by her family and married off to the cold mage, Cat\u2019s adventure is just beginning. There are enough twists and turns to keep it interesting despite the length of the novel. I will admit that a few of the twists were obvious chapters in advance of their revelation, and occasionally I was frustrated that Cat wasn\u2019t figuring things out faster, but it was never enough to make me want to put the book down, even for a moment!Setting: ***** 5 StarsThe alternate earth setting is drawn with fine detail and attention to our earth\u2019s history. Kate Elliott must have done a great deal of research in preparation for world building, because the quality of the descriptions and integration of backstory is unparalleled. Romance: **** 4 StarsI\u2019m giving the romance less than 5 stars for one reason and one reason only: Cat, though confused about her feelings, still doesn\u2019t trust or like Vai at the end of the book. I have a strong feeling this is going to change (okay, I already read the second installment, but I\u2019m reviewing that separately) but I couldn\u2019t give a full 5 stars when the romantic interest isn\u2019t at least partially gratified by the end. That being said, I loved the slow-build as Vai\u2019s true nature is revealed, and Cat\u2019s conflicting emotions. In the full arc of the trilogy, I expect great things from the two of them.Genre - Multiple: ***** 5 StarsThis may be the first book I\u2019ve read that crosses more than two genres. Certainly it\u2019s epic fantasy: it\u2019s a cross country adventure with magic and trolls and a parallel spiritworld. It\u2019s also steampunk with a conflict between the old magical order and the new technologies rising from the Amerikes. There\u2019s a potential for a strong romance between Cat and Andevai, and the the novel also takes place in an \u201calternate earth\u201d setting. Regardless, Kate Elliott does a wonderful job tying together these elements and creating a story that fits into all and none of these."}, {"userName": "Mogsy (MMOGC)", "userReviewDate": "Jun 21, 2013", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/4379514-mogsy-mmogc", "userReview": "3 of 5 stars at The BiblioSanctum http://bibliosanctum.blogspot.com/201...The positive things I've heard about Kate Elliott's books, especially praise for her Crossroads trilogy, have always piqued my curiosity and made me feel like I'm missing out for not having read any of her work. So when I saw the Cold Magic ebook on sale a few months back, I snapped it up and didn't even hesitate for a second.From its description, the book sounded like it would be right up my alley. Dawn of a new age? An Industrial Revolution which heralds inventions and technologies never seen before? Throw in a young, educated heroine caught up in the middle of this movement, and I thought it was going to be a winner for sure.In many ways, I was correct. This is undoubtedly a good book. The story is an intricate web of political intrigue and hidden truths, taking place in a world that is practically overwhelming with its multiple facets. And Catherine \"Cat\" Hassi Barahal is a headstrong protagonist, embarking on a perilous adventure to find out who she really is. All in all, I was quite enchanted by this novel and all the wondrous magic, people and creatures Cat encountered on her journey.And yet, I can't shake the feeling that this book could have been so much more. I wanted it to be great; I wanted to be amazed, but something always stopped me just short of getting to that point. After a while, I was finally able to pin down why I felt this way. Essentially, everything I mentioned before -- the fascinating characters, setting, and plot -- all started out on the right track, but ultimately never seemed to reach their potential.Perhaps the most frustrating of those for me is the setting, which had everything going for it with its steampunky flavor and even an alternate spirit realm. I was intrigued by the idea of a clash between magic and science, between the old and the new, but unfortunately what I'd hoped for never really materialized. Don't get me wrong; it's a complex and imaginative world, but it somehow lacked coherence. Incidentally, I felt much the same way about the story, which started losing its momentum after a strong introduction, in part due to the lack of clear direction.I also felt ambivalent towards Cat. I didn't dislike her but I didn't like her either, and therein lies the problem. It's hard to fully appreciate a book when the protagonist fails to interest me. Even now I can think of very little to say about her, except that I didn't really care for the way she was drawn to Andevai. Among my biggest pet peeves is when heroines fall for men who treat them badly, and Cat dances dangerously close to that line. Here's a man who snatches her from her home, speaks to her gruffly, and is an all around cold, arrogant jerk. By all rights she should want nothing to do with him, and yet he is shaping up to be the love interest.I guess I'll just have to wait to find out what happens. Though I liked this book well enough, I'm also not in any hurry to pick up the sequel. I'm certainly not writing this series off yet, but I have a feeling my next Kate Elliott book will probably be something else. After all, I have heard that her Spiritwalker series is very different from her previous work, and who knows, perhaps I'll check out the Crossroads trilogy first."}, {"userName": "Hallie", "userReviewDate": "Oct 22, 2010", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/1145657-hallie", "userReview": "Three and a half stars.I loved: the setting. Roman Empire continued a lot later than in \"our world\", and the society Elliott depicted is fascinating.I didn't love: the setting. It probably didn't help that I read this while (re)-working on a section of our book to do with alternate histories, and this almost is and isn't quite an alternate history. Little things kept niggling at me about that - why should there still be so much hatred against the Romans - even to the point of one character's saying that the British tribes still potentially have animosity among themselves over which ones supported the Romans and which didn't. But this Roman Invasion of Britain happened 2000 years before and even in our world with the Roman Empire disintegrating a lot sooner, the identification of British tribes certainly didn't carry on into the 1800s. There was quite a lot of characterisation along racial lines, which annoyed me a bit. Even though the Celts and the Africans who fled Africa centuries ago have intermarried, there are still things about typical Celts and the proud Kena'ani (don't dare call them Phoenicians, like the lying Romans!) that I found almost as irritating as comments about our-world racial types. I loved: the prose. Some of the descriptions were just fabulous - the school Cat and Bee went to before everything went pear-shaped, the spirit world, the way the mages' cold magic drained the heat from everything.I didn't love: the prose. Really, sometimes the imagery was way too much for my taste. And there were regular but not consistent uses of semi-archaic language that were not pleasing at all: \"If I do not mistake my ears, a host of mounted troops approaches\".Fantastic ideas in abundance, but enough that I didn't enjoy to bounce me out repeatedly. I'll probably wait for some of the people I know have liked this to read the rest of the trilogy and then decide whether to carry on myself."}, {"userName": "Sue (Hollywood News Source)", "userReviewDate": "Dec 09, 2015", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/6511257-sue-hollywood-news-source", "userReview": "Actual Rating: 3. 5 starsI would\u2019ve rated it higher if I didn\u2019t skimmed some of the scenes I deemed unnecessary.Cold Magic is without doubt one of the most ingenious and well established book I\u2019ve ever read.

The Hassi Barahals are a storied Phoenician clan of merchants, spies and traders of information, tracing their roots back to even before the height of Rome\u2019s ambitious empire. When she was six Cat\u2019s father, the scholarly wanderer Daniel Hassi Barahal, and her mother, the Amazonian warrior Tara Bell, perished in a river crossing accident, leaving sole survivor Cat an orphan. Taken in by her Aunt, Uncle and her beloved cousin Beatrice, Cat has lived a happy, if quiet, life.But onne day Cat\u2019s world is shattered when a remorseless Cold Mage of the powerful Four Moons House comes to her Uncle\u2019s home and demands the hand of the eldest Hassi Barahal daughter, as payment of a family debt incurred years earlier. Forced into a magically binding marriage \u2013 one that can be severed only by death \u2013 Cat is cruelly yanked from her home and whisked across the unforgiving, frozen countryside to Four Moons House, for reasons unknown to Cat. What she does know, however, is that her whole life and home was a lie, and she realizes that the only reason she had been taken in by her relatives was for this specific moment in the future; because Cat\u2019s birthday rests a few months earlier than that of her beautiful and much loved cousin, Bee. And this is just the first of the many revelations that Cat makes on the road to her destiny \u2013 where she encounters death sentences, betrayals, magic, and closely guarded secrets at every turn.Cold Magic is only the second novel I\u2019ve read by Kate Elliott (despite her pretty impressive backlist), and, as I\u2019ve said before, I was worried when I started the book due to conflicting reviews. Plus, as it\u2019s marketed as a pseudo-steampunk fantasy novel, I was even more hesitant to dive in (since steampunk is becoming the new vampire \u2013 and by that I mean played the eff out). Thankfully, I did suck it up and make the purchase, because Cold Magic is one *really* darn good book.Although set in the early Victorian era in an alternate world, Cold Magic is about as steampunk as that one episode of NCIS: Los Angeles (which is to say: NOT AT ALL). No, Cold Magic is proto-steampunk if it\u2019s anything to do with the subgenre (yes, there\u2019s ONE airship but, as Ana and I always say, a single dirigible does NOT a steampunk novel make), and it\u2019s actually much more of a traditional fantasy novel \u2013 magic, carriages, taverns with lots of mead and cheese and tough bread, etc. Where Cold Magic excels is with the book\u2019s worldbuilding \u2013 I loved the alternate/revisionist history with its strong Roman, Celtic and African tones, the different creatures (like trolls and enu) and hierarchy of magic (from wise djelis to the ruthless Cold Mages). Cat\u2019s world is a beautifully textured and incredibly well-conceived place \u2013 clearly, I need to read more of Ms. Elliott\u2019s work, because I am a sucker for intricate histories and worldbuilding.In addition to the solid foundation of the book, Cold Magic has adventure and revelations in spades, as well as a dash of romance. Although the book isn\u2019t perfect and the first third is deceptively mundane and hard to get into (I found my interest wandering as the story seemed as though it would head in a very pedestrian direction, i.e. Cat falling in love with her bridegroom despite his purported cruelty and they both struggle against the constraints of the Cold Mage House and live happily ever after), there is a big WTFPOLARBEAR moment that totally changes the direction of the book and makes it AWESOME.1 Add to this wonderfully executed twist some solid (if slightly unoriginal) characterizations, and you\u2019ve got the makings of an excellent book.As a heroine, Cat is resourceful, brave and stubborn, and although some of the romantic trappings are trite (Cat\u2019s complete ignorance of her effect on certain male characters, for example), her narration lends a strong, believable voice to the novel. Cat is put to the test harshly in this book as everything she has known about her past is challenged, and I couldn\u2019t help but sympathize with her and root for her all the way. Of course, the other half of the equation is Andevai, Cat\u2019s imperious, cruel, powerful Cold Mage of a husband \u2013 who could have easily become a usual romantic lead type of stereotype, but turns out to be surprisingly complex, with layers of conflict and nuance with his family, the mages that have taken him in, and his own power. And while, yes, the romance is utterly predictable, that doesn\u2019t mean it isn\u2019t fun to read. Almost all of the characters in Cold Magic are similarly well-written and layered \u2013 in fact the only character I wasn\u2019t crazy about was Cat\u2019s sister-cousin Beatrice (who only irritated me because of her character as the beautiful powerful one that everyone desires, and her tendency to say annoying things to Cat about Cat\u2019s choices \u2013 which is to say, her character is written brilliantly, and my distaste is not because of a failing of the author\u2019s but a justifiable bias!). I also loved Rory, but I\u2019ll refrain from digging into his character, as that way lies spoilers.Now, while I did love Cold Magic, there were a number of things I wasn\u2019t crazy about. As I mentioned earlier, the book\u2019s first act plods along at a slow pace and feels extremely pedestrian (I\u2019m sure this is where the book loses most readers, who probably wonder what the hubub is all about). Also, there is an abundance of awkwardly repetitive phrasing (e.g. Cat\u2019s fixation with Andevai\u2019s distinguished jawline), and before the big WTF POLAR BEAR moment (which totally revitalizes and changes the direction of the book), I was losing interest with all the taverns and the eating of food, since Cat is both freezing and constantly ravenous for the first half of the book and eats a lot of tough bread and sharp cheese and cold chicken and\u2026 you get the picture. Also, there\u2019s a disproportionate amount of time spent on descriptions of Andevai\u2019s wardrobe, which struck me as kind of silly.But, these are for the most part overlookable flaws in what is a solid start to a new trilogy. I really, really liked this book. Heck, I loved it. Maybe I\u2019m not *quite* head over heels in love\u2026yet. But I\u2019ll DEFINITELY be back for more (and had I read this in 2010, it would have made my honorable mentions list because it is so wonderfully detailed and I heart Cat). Absolutely recommended for fans of fantasy in the style of N.K. Jemisin, Sharon Shinn and Sherwood Smith."}], "description": "As they approach adulthood, Cat Barahal and her cousin Bee think they understand the society they live in and their place within it.
