Some stories light, some sad, some thinkers. All intended to be about the female experience today, and while I would question the validity of that assertion for some, on the whole I enjoyed reading the stories and was prompted to think about my own experience.The prhase \"she is quick and curious and playful and strong\" was supposed to be in each story and it was. But I never felt it was incorporated well. Maybe because having it in all made it noticable. Maybe its just an awkward phrase. But in the end, when placed in these stories, most could have kept it or left it.In ranking, from best to worst:1) Good-Bye, My Lady by Suzanne Rivecca (would have been a 4 by itself)2) Go in Peace, Not in Pieaces by Laurie Baker (ditto on above about the 4)3) Waiting by Amanda Smyth4) Anna & Patrick by Ilana Stanger-Ross5) Love and Other Convictions by Bridie Clark6) Engagement Chicken by Hannah Seligson (would have been a 2 by itself)7) Girl 57 by Sara Vilkomerson (ditto on the 2)"}], "description": "In collaboration with Kate Spade New York, the Strand has commissioned short stories from seven female writers, asking them to incorporate the phrase, \u201cshe is quick and curious and playful and strong,\u201d at some point in their story. The end result is a charming collection featuring seven very different voices. Artfully designed in a limited-edition set, it\u2019s a lovely gift to give (or to get).", "title": "She is Quick and Curious and Playful and Strong: Short Stories from Kate Spade New York", "url": "http://www.goodreads.com/book/show/18323644-she-is-quick-and-curious-and-playful-and-strong", "average": 2.8, "cover": "https://images.gr-assets.com/books/1445263772l/18323644.jpg", "reviews": 1, "authors": [{"url": "https://www.goodreads.com/author/show/3092074.Laurie_Baker", "name": "Laurie Baker"}, {"url": "https://www.goodreads.com/author/show/80957.Bridie_Clark", "name": "Bridie Clark"}, {"url": "https://www.goodreads.com/author/show/3105423.Suzanne_Rivecca", "name": "Suzanne Rivecca"}, {"url": "https://www.goodreads.com/author/show/231721.Hannah_Seligson", "name": "Hannah Seligson"}, {"url": "https://www.goodreads.com/author/show/2275120.Amanda_Smyth", "name": "Amanda Smyth"}, {"url": "https://www.goodreads.com/author/show/2039628.Ilana_Stanger_Ross", "name": "Ilana Stanger-Ross"}, {"url": "https://www.goodreads.com/author/show/7218924.Sara_Vilkomerson", "name": "Sara Vilkomerson"}], "type": [], "outlinks": ["http://www.goodreads.com/book/show/18323644-she-is-quick-and-curious-and-playful-and-strong", "http://www.goodreads.com/book/show/33207302-houses", "http://www.goodreads.com/book/show/33209060-a-manual-of-cost-cuts-for-strong-acceptable-housing", "http://www.goodreads.com/book/show/32075728-alleppey---venice-of-the-east---a-report", "http://www.goodreads.com/book/show/35128653-a-u-2000", "http://www.goodreads.com/book/show/22379554-the-essential-cockatoo"]}
