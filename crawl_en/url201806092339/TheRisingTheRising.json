Survivors wander around, staying one step ahead of the undead hordes and struggling to survive. Rogue military units are on patrol, rounding up survivors. Meanwhile, Jim Thurmond is on a trek from West Virginia to New Jersey to find his son...I'm a zombie fan from way back. My favorite movie as a teenager was the 1990 Night of the Living Dead remake. I have the Return of the Living Dead soundtrack on vinyl (I can smell your brains!) and Zombies!!! the board game. About fifteen years ago, I kind of fell out of zombie fandom since it felt like it had all been done many, many times. However, in recent weeks we've dusted off the Zombies!!! board game and I had the hunger for some zombie fiction. This hit the spot like some nice warm brains.The cause of the zombie plague this time was the government mucking with the barriers between dimensions. Now, everything with a brain gets reanimated upon death AND retains some of its own knowledge. The zombies in The Rising can use guns and drive as well as munch human flesh. I'm old school: I like my zombies slow, dumb, and numerous. However, these zombies wound up being very scary.The gore and violence level is pretty high. People get chomped quite a bit and there are headshots galore. The zombie animals are no picnic either. Swarms of zombie birds are nothing to scoff at, not even in a helicopter.The different viewpoint characters are what set this apart from being a typical zombie killfest. I felt for Jim's plight, even though I was pretty sure he'd get Cujo-ed at the end. Frankie was a born survivor. I was pretty sure she'd live through it. Baker's relationship with Worm was touching so I knew the emotional wringer was coming my way. While I was disgusted by the national guard unit led by Schow, I had no trouble believing in it.There were a lot of memorable, inventive scenes in this book. The Rising was harder to put down than a shotgun during a zombie apocalypse. I've read a couple Brian Keene books before but now I'm a Brian Keene fan. Five out of five stars."}, {"userName": "Char", "userReviewDate": "Sep 13, 2016", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/6581119-char", "userReview": "3.5 stars!It didn't take long to make my way through this zombie filled wasteland of a book. Humans, (whether they  still  be humans or be they zombies), are not the only monsters here. I loved the originality of this story. I can't get into the specifics of it without spoilers, but some of the things imagined and written about in The Rising have  still  not been done in other zombie books or movies. I really felt something for a few of these characters too. The author pretty much put everyone and everything at risk, so I had no idea what might happen to these people; there was no safe feeling like some books provide you, where you know the good guy will win in the end. What I did not like is a short list and here it is: The narrator and the fate of most of the female characters. First, the narrator had a fine voice but he mispronounced some words, (brackish is not brake-ish), and his tone of voice was often off. (Obviously, the tone thing is a personal opinion, while the mispronounciations are not.) Second, I've been a horror fan for a long, long time and I'm quite used to the treatment of women in horror stories being less than stellar. I also understand that a female, or male protagonist for that matter, has to be put into positions where the reader can root for her or him. However, what happened to the women here bothered me a bit more than usual. Perhaps, because the descriptions were graphic? (But I've read Laymon, Barker and even some Lee and none of those bothered me.) Maybe it's because I'm getting older and my tolerance for that type of behavior, even in books, has now dwindled down to nothing? Even if I can't quite put my finger on it, it bothered me, so that's that. Overall, I enjoyed this book! The originality of it was mind-blowing, and it must have been the horror book of ALL horror books when it originally came out back in 2003. Remember, this was before The Walking Dead and the whole zombie mash-up thing, (Pride and Prejudice With Zombies, anyone? WTF?). I do plan on reading the sequel, City of the Dead, but I'm going to do just that-read it, instead of listening, because the narration of this one did diminish my enjoyment a little bit. Recommended to fans of ZOMBIES!"}, {"userName": "CasualDebris", "userReviewDate": "Oct 15, 2008", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/268040-casualdebris", "userReview": "There are too many things wrong with this book. Despite some original ideas and a few worthy tense moments, it is most of the time laughably bad, and embarrassingly badly written.The amount of typos and the atrocious grammar was shocking. Someone needs to tell Keene, the copyeditors and publishers that the past tense of \"to spit\" is \"spat\" and that you don\u2019t tell a person to \"lay\" but to \"lie\" down. Your prose can also benefit by not using the word \"again\" (or any word, really) again and again three times in a single sentence. With books like there it isn't surprising that western society is inadequately literate. But I digress.The explanation of what is causing the zombie epidemic is absolutely ridiculous; I won\u2019t spoil it though it\u2019s revealed early on (no suspense here). The zombies are supposed to be intelligent yet act like hyper teenage boys who make absurd decisions that do little in advancing their cause. In fact, an integral aspect of becoming a zombie in Keene's world is to suddenly & intensely hate humanity, & to drop several notches on the IQ pole. (Kind of like some of our modern cults, I suppose.) Moreover, Keene appears uncertain as to the extent of the epidemic. He can\u2019t seem to decide whether insects are infected or not, and changes his mind mid-text, or simply forgets. If you plan to read this book, keep your eyes out for this. Maybe he clears this up in its sequel? I won\u2019t know since I won\u2019t be reading it.The characters are two-dimensional and Keene\u2019s image of America is a white-washed suburbia where Hispanic and black people can only be preachers, drug dealers or prostitutes. And as mentioned in other reviews here, the dialogue is bad. And I mean effin\u2019 bad, man. Holy mother-effin\u2019 stinkin\u2019 bad like.Finally, I was troubled by the amount of emphasis on rape in the book. I don\u2019t need the details. Maybe one brief instance to illustrate the morally decayed post-epidemic world, but not again and again. (That was only twice.) It is just inappropriate. I know I\u2019m supposed to be angry with the \"bad guys\" but the constant exaggerated rape just has me angry at the author.I can go on but won\u2019t since really there\u2019s no effin' need to..."}, {"userName": "Paul Nelson", "userReviewDate": "Apr 29, 2015", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/7553206-paul-nelson", "userReview": "Not your normal Zombie\u2019s, thank fuck, these can think, even plan their main course from well done to medium rare (that's where you come in) and the return of the dead is eagerly awaited, they have purpose.\u00a0Although it\u2019s the normal method of dispatch in a head shot or decapitation, luckily that's pretty much one of the few things in common with your average literary zombie catastrophe. These Zombies are controlled by a demon like entity that has an intelligence and the wherewithal of the previous host but there's a controlling hierarchy with a definitive means to an end (yours).\u00a0The only major difference in Zombie fiction is the characters, most of its been done before countless times, if the characters are worth reading about then you feel like you haven't completely wasted your time.\u00a0Thankfully this was a refreshing change, a scream inducing cliff hanger of an ending coupled with characters that I actually gave a shit about and Zombie animals, even your friendly pet can take a chunk out of your leg.

Where to start...Whilst looking for zombie books worth reading, I saw this one mentioned and figured it looked like it might be a decent read.I was so wrong. Maybe the fellow in the forums that mentioned this book as being good was a 7 year old?Reading this was painful. It started out alright, and well written, but then degenerated into what can only be described as a paper version of the worst B movie ever made. Really I only need to give you a few examples of things that happen in this book that made me shake my head in amazement:The 'zombies' are dead people posessed by 'demons' out to wreck 'The Creators'(read, god)world.The zombies are smart and can use guns and vehicles. So you have zombies shooting people, chasing people around in cars and generally being dicks. The zombies make use of one liners that would make Scwarzenegger, Stalone, Seagal and Van Damne all reel backwards in absolute disgust.Really, this book is absolute poop and I wouldnt reccomend it to anyone unless you want to see just how bad it is. A strong god theme with over emphasised gore and badly described scenes with ridiculous dialogue. Zombie baby tearing its way out of the zombie mothers womb and chasing after a guy while talking in sumerian? Yes. Zombie tiger killing stereotypical black gang-bangers? yes.Stupid Stupid STUPID.Dont read it."}, {"userName": "Caryn", "userReviewDate": "Dec 14, 2007", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/675898-caryn", "userReview": "I'm sorry - zombie fish?

They are relentless, they spread like wildfire, and they hunger for human flesh. Under the weight of hordes of the undead, civilization folds in on itself and the survivors are left to fend for themselves. That's why I like a good zombie apocalypse story. And that's why I was so excited to read Brian Keene's story.The problem with zombie apocalypse stories is that they tend to be formulaic. There is an outbreak. Civilization collapses. A small group forms and tries to survive against the undead - only to learn that the real enemies are other survivors. When reading about the coming zombie apocalypse, I really want to see something original. (Okay, something original or just damn good writing and characters). The Rising starts off well. Jim was a bit of a survivalist, so the story opens to find him in a bunker with the undead clawing away outside. He is alone, depressed and ready to off himself when he gets a call from his son. Dropping everything Jim starts a quest to rescue his son in distant New Jersey. Okay, the author has my attention. If I thought I could save my kid, I'd take the chance too.Further sparking my interest are the zombies themselves. Yes, they are dead and rotting, but they are also possessed of a keen and burning intelligence. They are capable of talking, of using tools, of driving, of firing guns. Worse, they set cunning traps for the unwary. And, after they gorge on their victims, the unfortunate souls rise to join their ranks. What's more, the zombies aren't limited to humans. Anything that dies joins their ranks - dogs, cats, cows, birds, etc. (Notable exception of insects, apparently). Again, the author has my interest. (The roots of the zombies is a bit corny, but still interesting). The story, unfortunately, goes bad quickly. After a brief spark of interest I really didn't care for any of them. That's a problem when the main story arc follows a man trying to rescue his son. Worse, the author throws so many characters at you that I found it hard to really connect with any of them. It seems to me it would've been wiser to build a few solid characters before adding more to the mix. Somewhat related, was it just me or was every black character a stereotype? You have a preacher, a prostitute, gang bangers, etc. What about just a former small business owner, or cop, or teacher, or factory worker?And, as the story progressed, the author repeatedly intervened to save characters deemed important. The worst was about halfway through when Jim and his companion are saved just in the nick of time not once but twice! Trapped by zombies on the Pennsylvania Turnpike, the undead are gunned down by a couple of country yahoos. Great! Only these guys turn out to be cannibals who want to cook these two for dinner. Fortunately the Deliverance rejects are gunned down by a kindly old man and his son who just happen to be in the area. Really?! Miraculous rescue once, sure. Twice, no way. Piled on top of this is the really annoying descent into the standard story line. The real enemies are the other survivors, mainly Colonel Schow and his unit of National Guard troops in Gettysburg. With civilization in tatters they decide to set themselves up as petty tyrants. The male civilians are used as force labor and the ladies find themselves forced to *ahem* service the soldiers. Two huge problems with this. First, rape. Second, it's lazy. How many times have we seen this story line?Adding to this mess of a story is the logic of the author's zombies. As any newly dead creature will rise as a zombie, the author's story runs into a major logic problem that I couldn't shake. If each zombie simply kills one living creature each day, the number of zombies will quickly reach uncontrollable levels. And I'm sure that they kill more than one a day. That means that after just a few weeks it is almost inconceivable that any living creature could avoid the decaying eyes of the almost countless undead. How then, do Jim and others somehow manage to trek across Pennsylvania?Finally, the worst of the worst is the ending. It was a cheap, cheap ending. Let's just say that the main characters are placed in a situation (at the boy's house) where they split up. There is gunfire and shouts. And then the book ends. So (1) I never learned whether or not Jim rescues his son, and (2) I never learned what the gun play and shouting was about. Apparently to find out the answers to these questions I need to buy book #2. Really unsatisfactory. I completely understand leaving some story lines incomplete, e.g., the main zombie dude and what he is conspiring, but to take you to literally the front door of Jim's son's house and then end the book?! That is unacceptable.One and a half stars grudgingly rounded up to two. I gave him the benefit of the positive rounding due to the intriguing premise and the unique zombies. Not a book that I could recommend other than to the most die-hard of zombie apocalypse fanatics."}, {"userName": "Filamena Young", "userReviewDate": "Jun 01, 2009", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/2374633-filamena-young", "userReview": "So to be perfectly honest, I\u2019ve been going back and forth on whether on not I actually wanted to write this review. It basically came down to \u2018not burning bridges\u2019 in a very small universe, or being honest with my readers. (I know, all three of you.)When I weighted it out, I decided a bad review treated fairly and note based on gut reaction might be better for the internet as a whole then a blank space. Plus, that way, as new readers show up, (I\u2019ll welcome you, reader number four,) they can feel secure that I\u2019m reviewing for honesty and not just for links and incest.So without further ado, my review of Brian Keene\u2019s first novel The Rising. Not his last book by far, God bless him, I never intended to review only new books, however, so bare with me.How I Found This Book: Do you know, I\u2019m not sure? I think it\u2019s one of those convoluted social networking messes, like a guy who knows a guy invited me to Ning network and I followed him back on Twitter and then he mentioned Keene, and I was like, \u2018I want more writers I love,\u2019 so I went out and picked up this book. (Internet ties always make me think in run-on sentences.)That said, let me tell you, I really really wanted to love this book. I wanted to pick it up and love every goddam page of it and eat if for breakfast and run out and buy everything Keene ever wrote and be a fangirl and run screaming through the rain to get to the front of the line at book signings.So, you know, the fact that I actually kind of hate this book A LOT makes the possibility of those other things happening pretty slim.Lemmie see, a book with a construction worker, a old priest, and a ex junkie ex hooker team up to save the construction worker\u2019s son from the zombie hoard? Where the hell do I sign up? I usually hate the synopsis on the back of the books. In this case, I actually wish the book fit it\u2019s back cover. Alas, not so much.The Good: Erm. Well. You know, um. Okay, that\u2019s not fair. To be fair, this book has a lot going for it. Keene\u2019s got a real gift with sensory detail, which is important in a zombie novel. There are things in the book that are really truly gross in an enjoyable way, and I think that was the writer\u2019s intention. At one point he describes the smell of a man\u2019s infected leg not unlike a microwaved hotdog. I don\u2019t know if this is completely true, but it sure was vivid. I\u2019ll also note that this is a first novel, and maybe some of the problems I had with it had more to do with Keene exorcising some demons then any actual defect in his personality. Who knows, right? Also, there are some KILLER ideas in there. Sentient zombies? Check. The host of Hell? Check. The military going crazy and trying to take over? Check. A heartfelt search to save a man\u2019s estranged son? Well, most of a check.The Bad: The problem is, none of those good ideas got followed completely, while Keene instead chose to focus on a strange rape fixation and this weird \u2018all people are bad, or if not, they\u2019re dead\u2019 philosophy that seemed forced. Time and time again, the characters run into people who have gone from normal to people to mustache twirling evil in the few months since the dead started to walk. I understand that without civilization, people are likely to get WAY more selfish and blah blah, but Keene\u2019s focus seems to all but ignore the zombies and focus on the \u2018evil that men do\u2019 in such cartoonish fashion that I imagined the demonic zombies sitting on the side lines going \u2018hey, we\u2019re over here yanno. We\u2019ll rape, pillage and eat you too if you\u2019d just give us a little attention.\u2019When I was talking to my husband about this book I had a long, feminist rant about how disgusted I was by much of the stories fascination with taking sexual advantage of the main heroine, but I think I\u2019ll spare you. Suffice to say, when Keene decided to describe in detail a gang-bang followed by urination on the woman I assume I\u2019m supposed to identify with, I threw the book across the room. And don\u2019t even ask me about the Meat Wagon, a brothel on wheels that the National Guardsman build to turn every woman they run across into a sex slave. I\u2019m sure a busy man like Brian Keene isn\u2019t going to read this, and if he is, I\u2019m sure he\u2019ll dismiss it because it\u2019s a bad review, but really, Brain, man, lighten up on the women, huh? We want to be your audience too. If you really think this is the way men would behave when society falls, I weep for your outlook on life.So why did I finish reading it? I guess I kept hoping the last few pages would be some kind of pay off. That I\u2019d get some reward for the disgusting cartoon I had read that far, but alas, I was never satisfied. The book brings you right up to the point where you find out if the construction worker\u2019s son is alive or not, (you know, the reason I\u2019m reading the book in the first place? The story?) And that\u2019s it. To the door, no further.The damn thing didn\u2019t end.I don\u2019t know if I was expected to make up my own ending, or if I was expected to read the sequel as a result, but I can tell you one thing, I LIKE open endings and cliff hangers. I did not feel like this was either a cliff hanger or open ended. To be perfectly honest, I feel like the ending was a cop-out. Like Keene had lost his real story some where along the sadistic-rape-happy way and couldn\u2019t bring himself back to it in time to end the book. But what the fuck do I know, right? This guy has had a dozen novels published, and I\u2019m still 0 for 0.Who Will Like This Book: I want to say something snide like, \u2018not anyone I want to be alone in a room with,\u2019 but that\u2019s probably unfair. I know he\u2019s got a hell of a following, I\u2019ve checked out his fan community, but wasn\u2019t terribly surprised to see a lot of military or ex military men in the forums. I\u2019m sure they saw things in this and other books by Keene I\u2019m just not seeing, or maybe they just didn\u2019t see the degradation and humiliation I found so appalling. That\u2019s not really for me to say, so I\u2019ll just say this; true to the back cover, this book is not for the squeamish.Who Won\u2019t Like This Book: Other than me? Again, hard to say. I read some unnecessarily scathing comments on Amazon, but that wasn\u2019t a big surprise. I know my husband would hate it. I figure if you want a deep psychological look at humanity and their responses to chaos and damnation, this probably isn\u2019t the book for you."}, {"userName": "Beatriz", "userReviewDate": "Oct 09, 2016", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/46560610-beatriz", "userReview": "Le\u00ed esta novela como parte del desaf\u00edo Hell-o-Win de La Cafeter\u00eda de Audrey.

I've only mentioned this in a few reviews, but it's one of those intangible gifts that some authors have and that I admire greatly, and it's this:Pacing.I was a little over 80 pages into this, when I flipped to the front cover to be sure I hadn't misread it.

Then I was pulled.Man, this guy had a fairly large cast for such a short novel, but in no way did I find switching from one character set to another slow up the story at all. Quite the opposite.Looking back, I'm still amazed at how a writer can do this so smoothly.This was a good story. Typical in the zombies-are-outnumbering-us kind of formula, but very untypical in the nature of the zombies. A lot of purists didn't like this, but I thought it was great. I also loved the ending, which turned off a few reviewers as well. The Rising broke a few rules, but wait a second...in fiction the winners are those who acknowledge that there are no rules. Good on Brian Keene.Now, I shouldn't have to say this to horror aficionados, but there are some pretty intense things that happen in this book, violently and sexually.

Here's why: early on in Brian Keene's zombie adventure, we discover that it's not just humans that can become reanimated. Animals are fair game for zombification, too, and the demonic Siquissim that possess Earth's corpses give all these zombies the ability to talk. This means that in addition to talking zombie humans, we also get talking zombie fish and talking zombie lions. My first encounter with these creatures seriously disrupted my suspension of disbelief. Yes, ladies and gentlemen, a talking fish was enough to take me right out of this zombie novel. Over the last few years, though, as the book marinated in my psyche and I've become a regular listener of Keene's podcast and privy to the stories and behind-the-scenes discussions he's given us about his books and influences, I grew tempted to give The Rising another shot. Joe Hempel's narration of the audiobook edition sealed the deal. I love Joe (necessary disclaimer: I like Joe so much that I hired him to narrate my own novel, Mass Hysteria), and given the fandom and devotion surrounding The Rising, it was time to give it a second chance.Boy am I glad I did! In fact, knowing what to expect out of this book helped me enjoy it a heck of a lot more. My prior reading gave me the inside track on what's what here, and without any jarring surprises, like a talking fish, to snap me out of the reading I was able to really sink into the narrative and accept it for what it is. And what it is is a heck of a lot of dark, occasionally silly, pulpy fun. Keene's conceit for the zombie apocalypse is a nifty one. A Large Hadron Collider-like bit of science opens up a portal between this world and The Void, allowing the evil Siquissim entry into our dimension where they take up residence in our recently dearly departed. When a person shuffles off their mortal coil and their soul escapes the confines of the flesh and blood, a Siquissim takes its place. This is a zombie apocalypse by way of demonic possession and cosmic horror, and it's an interesting, original take on the end of the world as we know it. At the core of all this is our every-man hero, Jim, who just wants to make it to New Jersey to save his son. He's joined along the way by other survivors, but when a rogue platoon of National Guardsmen begin rounding up and enslaving folks, it's only a matter of time before everybody is set on a collision course. There's an urgency to Jim's situation, and the perils he faces on his road-trip serve to heighten the tension. Keene makes you feel his desperation as the clock ticks down, right from the opening chapter. I was surprised at just how emotionally resonant and earnest our introduction to Jim was, and Keene is sure to pull on our heartstrings every now and then, reminding us of the humanity of our small band of survivors even as he grips us in moments of true despair and shocking violence. Joe Hempel's narration is strong throughout, and I particularly liked the affectations he gave to the zombies, particularly Ob, the malevolent leader of the Siquissim. He voices each character well, providing enough subtle distinction and occasional accents or tones that each line of dialogue is unique to each speaker. Hempel's narration is top-notch, and his reading makes for a truly compelling listen. He's a great fit to Keene's sensibilities, and I'm looking forward to listening to his reading of City of the Dead next.While the text is the Author's Preferred Edition, I think it's safe to say the audiobook is my own preferred edition. Listening to Joe Hempel's reading of Brian Keene's Bram Stoker Award-winning debut horror novel was a terrific amount of fun, and it gave me a new appreciation for the work as a whole."}, {"userName": "destiny \u2620 howling libraries", "userReviewDate": "Mar 02, 2018", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/15335689-destiny-howling-libraries", "userReview": "DNF @ 35%I had read this once before and remember enjoying it (maybe in my late teens or early twenties?), but I couldn't get into it this time around. It isn't a bad book by any means - in fact, I think it offers an incredibly unique twist on zombies, by throwing in a supernatural/demonic quality to the \"virus\". It's clearly evident how Brian Keene affected the zombie story genre tremendously with the innovative perspective he offered, and the switches in perspectives give a unique insight into how different types of people would be affected by the same apocalyptic nightmare.That said, I think my problem is just that I have a hard time rereading horror novels (one of the few genres where knowing the ending of the story tends to hinder my interests), and I'm not the biggest fan of zombie books in general thanks to burning myself out on them years ago.I'm leaving off the star rating because I don't remember what I would have rated this as, based on my first reading years ago."}, {"userName": "Kristen", "userReviewDate": "Apr 25, 2008", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/1116185-kristen", "userReview": "This was the First Brian Keene book that I picked up, and to be honest... I wasn't expecting much. I enjoy a good Zombie film as much as the next person, but had never read a zombie book before. I was pleasantly surprised while reading this book. The characters were (for the most part) very real, engaging, and the type of people the reader cares about. The zombies were not your stereotypical zombies; they were far more mobile, and capable of using tools, weapons, and setting traps to catch the foolhardy mortals who they hunted. This made them all the more terrifying. There are several survivors whose stories we follow throughout the book, the primary ones being Jim a carpenter who is on the mission of finding his young son, Frankie a junkie/prostitute who is just trying to survive, and Baker one of the Scientists who started this whole mess who is seeking redemption. This book reads like a blended up version of \"28 days later,\" \"Apocalypse Now,\" and every Romero movie ever made. In fact many of these are mentioned in the book. Many people have complained about the ending, but I found it to be pretty typical of the zombie genera, true I would have loved one more page... but I wasn't dissatisfied in any way. It was pretty clear what happened, and true, it left the novel open for a sequel, but I don't think you really need one. In the end, this was a very well written, post-apocalyptic story about the survivors doing the one thing they have been good at so far - trying to survive."}, {"userName": "Andrew Lennon", "userReviewDate": "Sep 09, 2013", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/6115193-andrew-lennon", "userReview": "Firstly, I have never read a zombie book before. They just haven't ever appealed to me. Zombie films, yes, books, no. But I've read other stuff by Brian Keene so I thought I would give it a go.This is so different to a normal zombie story. For a start, the zombies have a good level of intelligence. Which I think makes them even more scary!When I first started the story I thought I might have given up quite quickly. I thought it was going to be stupid (ahem, zombie goldfish) but trust me. Do no let that put you off! There is far more than just human zombies in this story, it's all animals all shapes and sizes, and I assure you. It may sound silly, but in the book it is terrifying!I would definitely recomment this to any horror fans.

And here's the kicker: this Author's Preferred Edition of The Rising is even better. Aside from a 3 page passage that sticks out as unnecessary, everything else re-included here by Keene adds to the novel in a positive way. The characters are better drawn, and their actions seem more authentic for it. The ending has been much spoken about, but completely worked for me - even if the eventual sequel cheapens it to some degree.Run, don't lurch or stagger, to your keyboard to order this essential addition to any Keene fan's collection.

I seem to have quite the backlog of Keene books and they are neatly fitting the challenges. Awesome.Having enjoyed Keene\u2019s  Conqueror Worms  post-apocalyptic novel about giant worms (seriously) I\u2019m excited to see what he does with zombies.The book starts out similarly to The Conqueror Worms with a male protagonist telling the story of how his world collapsed but this time around instead of a cranky old dude we get an emotionally fragile young father. The stakes have been upped and I\u2019m hooked already.A zombie outbreak has destroyed civilization as we know it. Fortunately for Jim he prepared for Y2K and built a bunker where he has been hiding out alone ever since his second wife died of pneumonia and turned into a blood-thirsty zombie. His young son lives in another state with his ex-wife and he fears he\u2019s dead until his cell phone receives a message telling him otherwise. Coincidentally, his phone runs out of juice just as he\u2019s finished listening to the message so he can\u2019t call him back. Damn, that would be my luck. Now he must escape the angry hoards of zombies in order to locate and save his boy.These aren\u2019t your typical slow, brain-dead, zombies stumbling about with a mindless hunger for flesh. These zombies are scarier. They\u2019re angry, can use tools, drive, retain memories and will eat parts of you, leaving the rest available for their brethren to possess. Early on it is revealed that scientists were experimenting with other realms and somehow weakened the barrier allowing demons clear access to dead bodies both human and animal. Don\u2019t ask me to explain, I admit that I didn\u2019t understand this bit at all. As our hero is making his journey he crosses paths with other survivors all with their own survival stories. It\u2019s mostly interesting stuff but too often the zombies/demons act inconsistently when it is convenient for prolonging the life of a key character. Supposedly the zombies are angry and evil and have overrun the world and are living on human flesh which is in short supply. So why, when they spot a living human, would they give a little chase, shrug what\u2019s left of their shoulders and basically say, \u201cOh, we\u2019ll get him later.\u201d and then drive away from the human who was hoofing it? Maybe I\u2019ve seen too many zombie movies but sorry I\u2019m not buying that silliness at all. The other key characters are a guilt ridden scientist, a deaf boy, a heroine addict in withdrawal, a pastor and a bunch of military dudes (most of whom are stereotypical power hungry brutes). None of these folks are all that likable with all their faults, with the exception of the dad, but most are compelling nonetheless.Keene plays a fun little game of spot the horror author and names many of his brutish colonels and members of their brigade after fellow horror writers. I spotted Schow, Robert Dunbar, Partridge, Miller, \u201cand that shifty littler fucker Skip\u201d who turns out to be not quite as bad as the rest. There may have been more but those guys stood out and gave me a good laugh.I put this book down at about the midway point because a copy of Joe Hill\u2019s Horns was made available to me. After finishing Horns (which was amazing) I found myself enjoying this book a whole lot less. The character flaws, stereotypes and dumb-ass decisions made by the survivors and the zombies began to grate on my nerves. There is one scene that features a young boy and his dad that about made me put the book down for good. I absolutely could not believe what the characters had just allowed to happen. I won\u2019t spoil it but you\u2019ll know what I\u2019m talking about if you make it this far in the book. The solution was so simple to me yet the author writes an entirely unnecessary ghastly scene for shock value and emotional effect. Or at least that\u2019s how it came across to me. The only emotion I felt was anger for the heavy handed manipulation. And yet I trudged on, a glutton for punishment as always . . .In the end, I was not thrilled with myself for finishing this book. There was way too much gratuitous rape that pretty much takes over the last part of the book and the ending is a cliffhanger. But don\u2019t despair; you can always buy the continuation to learn the end. Since I have it in my tbr pile already I\u2019ll probably give it a go only because I liked \u201cThe Conqueror Worms\u201d so much but if I didn\u2019t own it already I might be a wee bit annoyed."}, {"userName": "Pamellia", "userReviewDate": "Nov 29, 2012", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/12457099-pamellia", "userReview": "The Rising by Brian KeeneOctober 2014HA Buddy Read for OctoberThe Rising is a book selected for a buddy read that I joined over on HA. I was told this was the start of the zombie genre and that it couldn't get any better than this. So I joined in expecting a good read and a fun time discussing this book.I thought the book had too much of an introduction before the actually story started. Then I realized part of the story, I believe, Mr. Keene was telling was the story of the characters. All of these seperate stories were interesting. Of course one knows that eventually all these characters will meet and either save the day, become part of the problem or die trying.In this zombie book all living creatures that can move are susceptible to becoming a zombie. Becoming a zombie is not really a virus in this book as it is in I believe all the other zombie books I have read. I'm not a big fan of our domestic pets and wild life becoming zombies...it is a personal preference and not a reflection on this story or the author.The characters are well written and their development showed superior writing.. I could see what Frankie looked like from her first introduction until the end of the book. Wonderful character development. One character had a lot of solid believes and was a great support to his friend. That friendship was nice and helped the less developed character reach many of his character goals. Over all I liked the book OK. My main purpose in reading it was to discuss it and I hope that soon our group can begin discussing the stories different aspects. Because the characters are so well written, planning a character discussion would be a good idea.I give this book 3.5 stars, rounded up to 4Recommended with caution (not just human zombies)"}, {"userName": "Unapologetic_Bookaholic", "userReviewDate": "Apr 29, 2008", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/1125077-unapologetic-bookaholic", "userReview": "Multiple characters are trying to survive in a world being overrun by zombies.

Rating a book badly based on grammar is too anal and could maybe account for 1/2 or 1/4 star off the rating but if the whole of the reason is based on bad editing I don't really understand why people are upset by this. This is not a perfect world where everything is up to standard. If you don't like GORE don't read horror. If you don't like SEX don't read erotica. If you do not like adult subject matter read Twilight =) I've seen some silly reasons to give low ratings to books but, my goodness, how do books get read for some of the reasons given why they are so bad. It has to end sometime, someway. I was glad to have both novels to read back to back or I'd have been a little mad about the end too. Brian Keene explains his reasons.

It's a zombie book and to be honest the genre has been done over and over with very little variation, but Mr. Keene brings a new voice (yes that's right voice) to the way you perceive zombies. There is no virus or outbreak that causes the people in this book to turn. It's possession. The details of how the demons posses the dead human body are intricate without being confusing. Keene paints an awesome picture of how and why these demons are possessing the bodies of the dead. THAT to me is a really nice twist on a zombie apocalypse story. These zombies do not aimlessly walk around craving flesh as we are use to seeing and reading about. They are rotting, walking, running, sprinting, gun toting, bomb making, destructive, murderous,and not to forget rather smart. If that doesn't sell you on this book maybe the zombie lion and zombie birds will get ya! That's right folks not even animals are safe! I love the main character's drive to find his son among all the destruction while banding together with an ex hooker and a preacher man.....yeah...that's an awesome threesome!
