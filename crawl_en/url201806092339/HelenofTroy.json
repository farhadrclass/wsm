It was so well written you can follow the story of Greek names, cities, statues, ritals, and Greek culture most people are not familiar with. The belief Greek people had in the immortal God's on high Olympus that of Zeus, Aphrodite, Athena, Persephone, Apollo, Artemis, Hermes, Hera, and others is almost magical. Helen, the Queen of Sparta, left her home for love and desire to be with someone seven years younger than she, all because of Arphodite the goddess of love. This turns tragic of course and ends in the Trojan wars that lasted ten years and Helen, who is now Helen of Troy, returning to Sparta after twenty-four years from the time she left with Paris, her true love. As elegantly spoken by Gleanor , \"Ends should not differ from beginnings,\" he said. \"To do so would impugn the truth of one or the other. We must keep our integrity.\" He turned me toward the pillars. \"Look upon it.\" Helen of Troy who launched a thousand ships because of her beauty is a timeless love story that if true could heal the world of its indifferences. A must read for all. Quote:\"Do not look too closely at something, do not come too near, or you might lose the wonder. That is what separates children from adults.\"I remembered Father's words: To know is to arm. An enemy seen a far way off cannot surprise. An enemy seen from a distance can be outwitted and avoided. Now people speak of 'the debt of Neoptolemus'-meaning that as you kill, so shall you be killed.\" Just as he had cruelly killed Priam at an altar, he himself had been struck down beside one. 'To Sparta! I have waited a generation, I can wait no longer! Girls born the day I left are long since mothers!\" he held out his hand to me and I took my place by his side. \"Passionate...I do not know.\" \"You will not until the man you love hold you.\" I leaned forward. \" With women, it is the man, and not the moment. That is the truth of it. With men it is the reverse.\""}, {"userName": "Arlene", "userReviewDate": "Apr 10, 2009", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/1746727-arlene", "userReview": "As an avid reader, it's not very often that you come across a book that immediately finds a spot on the top shelf of your bookcase. Well, Helen of Troy has earned that right, without a doubt. This book is sheer perfection in so many ways a simple review cannot express. The author did a beautiful job of telling the story of Helen of Sparta, later Helen of Troy from a perspective which seamlessly submerges you into the Trojan War. She weaved in all the right characters, events and emotions and wrapped it up perfectly with a carefully chosen point of view and back drop. I could not put this book down! Now keep in mind, it is a very complex read, and it may take time to finish the book. I normally finish a book of this size within a few days, but Helen of Troy took me twice as long, and I feel it was undoubtedly time well spent.Now to the story... Helen of Troy was rumored to have launched a thousand ships because of her sheer beauty. She was acclaimed to be responsible for the downfall of Troy and the loss of many Greek and Trojan lives. This story takes you back in time where the people of Troy and Sparta, as well as the surrounding kingdoms believed in their fate as provided by the gods. Helen's fate was one that brought suffering to herself and everyone around her. In this story, you learn about Helen's life as a young girl, her marriage to Menelaus, the birth of her daughter Hermione and ultimately her encounter with Paris the Prince of Troy, which eventually led to an inevidable love and the down fall of Troy.This book was filled with poetic moments of innocence and beauty, as the story is beautifully told through the POV of Helen. IMO it's an exquisite page turner filled with characters you can't get enough of either because you love or hate them, including Helen, Paris, Hermione, Menelaus, Hector, Andromache, Priam, Achilles, Agamemnon, Odysseus, and many, many more. This story brings to life the Trojan War in a manner you won't soon forget.

However memories of it faded over last few years. \"Helen of Troy\" definitely revived my interest in the subject and in historical fiction in general. There were many things that I loved about the book. The story of Helen was comprehensive and meticulously researched. I know for sure George stayed very close to the sources and the book was historically correct (well, as much as a book about mythical characters can be historically correct). I liked how numerous Greek myths were skillfully weaved into the narrative. I appreciated that George attempted to stay away from portraying gods as active players in the story (as they so often have been presented in Greek plays and legends), rather they stayed distant, almost imaginary. She slipped a couple of times when some occurrences were too magical for my taste - Paris's salvation by Aphrodite or Helen's gift of \"seeing.\" But overall I think this approach added to the feel of \"realness\" of Helen's life story. In spite of all these positives, however, the book definitely lacked something. I am saying this primarily because it was an extremely slow read for me, and I am a fast reader. I am not sure what made this book so hard to read - I was never bored, and yet I wasn't quite attached to the story. I think it can be attributed to the \"voice\" of the book, Helen's voice. Helen was quite a dull and emotionless narrator in my opinion. She was more of a spectator rather than an active participant throughout the book, and therefore everything she told us was bland, impersonal, and somewhat emotionless. Even her passionate affair with Paris that brought Troy to ruin, never quite touched me. And this was probably why I remained not fully involved in the story.I doubt that I will ever be able to reread this book, it was frankly a lot of work and I do not have patience to dedicate another two weeks to reading a 600-page book, but I might try to read some other book by George, maybe about Cleopatra."}, {"userName": "Janice", "userReviewDate": "Oct 26, 2009", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/32653-janice", "userReview": "I have previously very much enjoyed Margaret George's novels, most specifically her work on Henry VIII, Mary, Queen of Scots and Cleopatra. But as George continues to write about famous \"historical\" figures the last two she has chosen live more in myth rather than actual history (Mary Magdalene and now Helen of Troy). I couldn't feel sorry for Helen, and found it sort of cheap that the \"Gods\" interfered with Helen's emotions in order to make her fall in love with Paris. Previously the character's motives were rooted in their actual characteristics, but there was no motivation given for Helen's actions other than \"Aphrodite made me do it\" which didn't work in my mind.Additionally writing about a war that lasted 10 years, felt like it took 10 years to read. Paris was whiny, and unheroic up until the very end of the book and it's hard to understand why Helen chose him over the mostly honorable Menelaus other than \"he was hot and young.\" She's portrayed as the original cougar. I'm not sure I'd give Margaret George's next book a shot since I've been so disappointed with the last two. Instead of reading this book, you're far better off reading the Iliad instead."}, {"userName": "Judith Starkston", "userReviewDate": "Jul 26, 2011", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/4596767-judith-starkston", "userReview": "This is one of those books I\u2019ve been meaning to read, but didn\u2019t get to until now, published in 2006. Here\u2019s a somewhat meandering review, more a collection of my reactions/thoughts than a formal review. Margaret George writes historical fiction set in a number of periods from Cleopatra to Elizabeth I. I worried from a distance that someone who jumped around like that might be skimpy on the research and historical accuracy. Then I heard her speak at the Tucson Festival of Books, and I realized she is both very smart and has a great deal of integrity about just that issue. So I approached her gigantic Helen of Troy (606pp) with interest\u2014the period I most care about by someone who cared to do it right. Her approach to Helen is comprehensive. She starts with Helen as a small girl and takes her all the way through the Trojan War, back to Sparta and beyond. Besides making for a long book this also makes for a slightly amorphous book. There isn\u2019t a clear focus or drive\u2014whatever is next up in Helen\u2019s life, that\u2019s what we\u2019ll get. I don\u2019t mean George didn\u2019t lay out a plan, but there\u2019s often a lack of tension and a willingness to include information and scenes just for their enjoyment and detail. I happen to like an abundance of historical information and setting detail, so that\u2019s fine by me, but it\u2019s not a page-turner. Her portrayal of the Mycenaean world is quite faithful to Homer for the most part, which means it isn\u2019t always faithful to the most modern historical understanding of that place and time, but Homer is a good place to be. Her Troy is a Greek city, with only slight differences from the world of Sparta that Helen has left. The historian in me knows there\u2019s been some updates on that\u2014scholars no longer think the Trojans were Greek speaking, for example, nor that their material world was Mycenaean but rather closer to the Hittite cultural world to their east. But this is a mythologically based book so I\u2019m content to immerse myself in this Greek world, which is quite vivid and does reflect pretty accurately what we know about the Mycenaeans. The most compelling things about Helen of Troy, besides the abundance of detail of daily life and war in ancient times, are George\u2019s character portrayals. Helen starts out quite ordinary despite her half immortal parentage, except in the area of her startling appearance. Other than golden hair, George resists telling us what makes Helen\u2019s appearance so unusual. In this she takes her cue from Homer and paints Helen through the reactions of people to her rather than description. Helen acquires her visionary insights and her outsized passion from the gods as she goes along rather than from an inborn nature. She objects to being so special in appearance and as far as personality, she stays in normal human parameters: strong-willed at times, intelligent and perceptive about people and their faults, able to take command in times of need, but often an observer more than a doer. The magical sorceress-like character that sometimes appears in the myths and Homer is not present here except in rumors that Helen rejects. Although Helen and Paris go through a rough spot in their marriage, George has them cleave to each other to the end. Some readers of Homer would see a Helen who has grown bored and disgusted with her Paris long before the end of the war, so that\u2019s an interesting and conscious choice. Achilles is pretty much despicable through and through. He\u2019s violent and mean spirited with only one or two moments, for example in the face of Penthesileia\u2019s death, where he shows any positive actions or feelings at all. I\u2019ve always been partial to Achilles, seeing him as the laudable existential hero of the poem, so I\u2019m not with George on that read, but there\u2019s plenty in the tradition to support her portrayal and it works very well with her overall storyline. I think it does reduce Achilles and therefore the whole Trojan War aura, but her portrayal of Hector\u2019s nobility and her redeeming of Paris make up for that. Paris is a far more heroic character here than I would have been able to imagine, and I enjoyed that vision a great deal. It was fun and made Helen\u2019s choice far more satisfying. George uses some clever, if occasionally a little contrived, devices to put us on the scene with some famous moments in the Iliad. The novel is told from Helen\u2019s point of view, but she wanders in her inner vision onto battlefields, and at other points she observes private moments as an eavesdropper, such as the farewell scene between Andromache and Hector and their infant son. The tragedy of Troy\u2019s destruction is George\u2019s tour de force. As a reader I felt it in my bones. I wept with Priam and Hecuba and the growing bleakness and despair is beautifully depicted. She makes you want to reach into mythological history and rewrite it, make the whole thing come out differently, even as you read along knowing no such reprieve will come. That\u2019s good writing, for sure. The final parts in Sparta and then back to Troy have less emotional kick to them, but given her choice to portray Helen\u2019s whole life, they are unavoidable. I enjoyed George\u2019s Helen of Troy. There are probably pieces here and there that could have been edited out to carry the story forward more quickly (I can hear my critique partners/editors laughing at me\u2014that\u2019s always what I have to do), but if you love immersion in history, George excels at that and you might object if parts were removed."}, {"userName": "Lisa", "userReviewDate": "Jan 26, 2013", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/1512868-lisa", "userReview": "I love Greek mythology and think the fall of Troy is easily one of the most powerful myths around. Prior to reading this I would never have believed that anyone could tell it in such a way as to make it utterly boring, but sadly Margaret George has proved me wrong.Telling the story of Helen of Troy, the face that started it all, it's clear that Ms George put in rather a lot of research. It's just a shame that, while remembering to add in details like what sort of cups people might have drunk from, she didn't bring any real storytelling talent to the table. A tale that should have been pulsing with passion, instead I felt nothing. Even during the parts that would normally have me weeping like a bereaved child (the death of Hector, and Priam's pleas for his son's body to be returned) or cursing furiously (anything to do with that shit Achilles) I found it all strangely lacking.As for Helen, considering this is all told through her eyes, it seems that even though she's the main character she's not much more than an insipid, passive nincompoop, hardly the sort of person that thousands of men would give up their lives and bring ruin to kingdoms over, and the 600 odd-pages in her company were a slow torture.If you're after something that really brings the story of Troy to life you could do much better - I'd recommend David Gemmell's Troy series instead."}, {"userName": "TL ", "userReviewDate": "Jul 06, 2014", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/4342402-tl", "userReview": "*I don't know too much about the myth of Troy, just some stuff so bear with me*A wonderful novel of Helen and the Trojan War... everything was brought to life beautifully, I felt like I was walking the streets of Sparta and Troy. Miss George's writing was amazing, very rich and beautifully detailed. The pages fly by very quickly, even though this isn't a fast read. Helen and Paris' falling in love... happened a bit quickly for my taste and I had trouble believing their love for most of the book till they were in Troy and spent more time together... even then I still had mental flags popping up now and then.The 'gifts' of Helen's Sight (or however you want to name it), was a nice touch.Hector and Andromache were my favorites among the side characters, their love and devotion for each other, their family, and Troy shined through. Hector is fair, kind, strong... I would have loved to know him :). Andromache is a fitting partner for Hector, and a good friend to Helen.Having Helen's side of things and seeing how/what she thought of everything leading up to and surrounding the war was interesting... how lonely she felt in her marriage to Menelaus, her love for Hermione and Paris, flight to troy... it was interesting but also grating sometimes. There were many moments that I wanted to shake her and make her 'grow up' in a sense.It felt sometimes that she was 'stuck' a bit mentally and never fully matured... or maybe that's just me *shrugs*Don't get me wrong, I loved seeing things from her point of view and all but I would liked insight/point of views from the other people... Achilles would have specially interesting.-----Quote from near the end:\"I cannot believe that the extraordinary deeds and person of Achilles, Hector, Paris, and you will disappear. These were different than all those others. Different from Theseus and the Minotaur, different from Jason and his Argonauts, beyond the destruction of Andromache's city of Thebes.I smiled. At the moment I felt so much wiser than he. \"Dear friend,\" I said \"they all felt thus-- felt they, and their valiant deeds, could never vanish.\" ----These people live on in the many stories about them and will continue to fascinate, there's just something about all of them that draws you in. Makes you wonder too, if any of it could have prevented, or was it destined to play out as it was? Were any of them and the Trojan war real?

This book is one of my absolute favorites, and so underappreciated.Unlike many Helen of Troy books, George starts from the very beginning and goes all the way to the very end. And while this may seem like a long, tedious process for the reader, George\u2019s writing is so flipping fantastic that I STILL want more. George is also the first author that makes the whole \u201celopment\u201d storyline readable. I have always struggled with that storyline as a reader and avid Greek mythology fan, and the way George brings it to life makes Helen\u2019s life almost tangible to the point that you want to elope with her. Sorry, that was a mouthful. Am I the only one that\u2019s struggled with the adultery aspect of this myth? Though it seems like a common theme among Greek myths it was still hard to bear because it is the source of blame for the iconic war. Needless to say, George turns this thread in the storyline bearable and even enjoyable at turns. That brings me to the main heroine, Helen. She is a pampered princess, the most beautiful woman in the world, with men coming in droves to kiss her feet, and yet you still feel pity for her. She is the daughter of a god and a queen, and predictably her life will be tragic yet beautiful. The story plays in almost three parts, the first being her childhood up until her marriage to Menelaus, the second her elopment with Paris and consequential war, and the third plays a short but sweet part of her picking up the pieces. It\u2019s an ode to one of the most iconic, yet misunderstood, heroines of all time. Though this book is long, over 600 pages (which may seem like a walk in the park to George R.R. Martin fans like myself), each page is so beautifully written and gripping that you find yourself wishing for more as you turn the final pages. Overall, this book is great for lovers of Greek myths and epic love stories. George does a great job weaving the portrait of Helen with equal parts realism and magic, doing this epic story complete justice."}, {"userName": "Marissa Joyce", "userReviewDate": "Jul 13, 2010", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/3640962-marissa-joyce", "userReview": "It was a good book, but I found Helen's character to be petulant and frankly, annoying. Perhaps this is my own pet peeve, but I found Helen's attempts to externalize the blame and repercussions of her own actions on the gods to be really tiresome- especially after 600 pages. However, the characters were well developed, the splotseemed to stick to the historical data, and the storyline moved along at a quick pace. I enjoyed reading the novel, but I think I may have liked it more if Helen had been portrayed as a strong woman character who knew her own mind and heart- and owned her own decisions- not an immature whiner who blamed the tragic outcomes of her own decisions on the gods."}, {"userName": "Rebecca Huston", "userReviewDate": "Jul 19, 2012", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/4091267-rebecca-huston", "userReview": "One of the most boring, badly written, snooze-inducing novels that I have ever waded through.

And as someone who has always thought of Paris as a petulant child and Helen a victim of kidnapping and rape, I was interested to read George's slant on the events that transpired between the Trojan Prince and the Spartan Queen. I was dazzled. Helen's air headed tendencies aside, I found myself sympathizing with her more than once. She is most certainly a flawed character, but I found her humanity and tenacious spirit compelling. As for Paris, I was able to see beyond the arrogant child that I always thought him to be and perhaps fell a little in love with him myself. He and Helen's interactions were passionate and beautifully written. The chemistry between these two lovers could have ignited the pages. The tragic inevitability of their pairing was truly poetic and the ending was breathtaking, I say that because I was sobbing as I read it. Georgoe seemlessly transports her readers to both Sparta and Troy. I felt as though I could smell the sea, feel the wind, and touch every blade of grass.

There are numerous tales of the greatest warriors that fought the war and endless stories of the watching gods. Margaret George tells a different story. It is the story of Helen and how she went from being Helen, Queen of Sparta to Helen of Troy. And the story is told through her eyes. From her childhood when she strained against her restraints and resented the fact that she had to wear a veil and stay hidden. Hearing rumors and whispers all her life about how she wasn't her father's daughter how in fact she was in fact the daughter of Zeus. To her marriage to Menaleus where she resigns herself to a passionless life and finally to the day she meets Paris after an encounter with Aphrodite. Aphrodite promised Helen that she would bestow passion on her life, and Helen believing that she would finally have a passion filled marriage returns home and runs into Paris. After that first glimpse she knows what true desire feels like. And things go down hill from there. Knowing that she can no longer live without Paris in her life they decide to let the chips fall where they will and escape together. Thus begins the most passionate love filled adventure of Helen's life. And what follows her and Paris is not joy and a long life of love together but destruction and hatred. Thus begins the Trojan war. All due to a promise that was made when Helen chose Menaleus as her husband that all the other suitors would band together if their marriage was questioned.Written from Helen's perspective the story takes on a new energy. I know the some of the stories of the Trojan War and what led up to it. This gives it a different flavor and we are able to see the war as Helen saw it. She truly had love for Paris and her adopted country of Troy and hated watching the Greeks destroy it.

Too often the story gets lost in the historical details, and before I know what's happening I'm stuck in a history lesson in high school, my ancient teacher leaning over me, hair growing profusely out of his ears.

(I say this at the risk of sounding completely demented) The story of Helen and the fall of Troy was never my most favourite myth but recently, I started to gravitate towards it and am very fascinated with many of the secondary characters involved. I was pleased to read that George had included them with sufficient backstory: Cassandra, Clytemnestra, Aphrodite, Athena, Electra, and Orestes. What was really entertaining about this novel is that George really captured the beguiling charm of a good ol' Greek myth in its setting. The inclusion and interactions of the characters were believable, yet equally magical. What irked me is that Helen of Troy is overly long, making it a bit of a drag when the tension was shifting between events. George is occasionally abrupt and sparse with language, which might have compounded this. Plus, Helen, at times, felt a little too passive and introspective to my liking, since I expected her to be one of the more vivacious women of Greek mythology. But I did like her maternal instinct throughout the book.

I boldly capitalize the word \u2018fiction\u2019 because the original story of Troy and its long siege per se is a fictitious yarn, loosely based on events whose historicity has yet to be fully proven. The famous narrative \u2018Iliad\u2019 has become the intrinsic part of human cultural heritage and in its turn has given birth to a number of artistic interpretations. Most of the spin-offs (novels, paintings, poems, movies, plays) mainly tell the story of warriors and men. This lengthy novel gives a unique feminine perspective.Helen of Sparta, later ofTroy, tells us the story of her life, marriages, loves, hopes, an epic destruction. Due to the cultural background, the plot is not original as it retells the story every person is expected to be familiar with. What is unique about this novel is the strong and independent feminine voice of the narrator who deals with the burden of circumstances, curses, fate, and people who drastically change her life.Despite the numerous tragedies (the death of her mother, her brothers, her beloved, and other people he liked) Helen is not an embittered character even in the land of strangers. The author masterfully shows her conflicted soul and how she has to accept her new loyalty in the war betweenGreeceandTroy. The characters on both sides of this war are believable and surprisingly human. The only two of them stand out due to their voracious desire to accumulate power and to kill \u2013 they are Agamemnon and Achilles. And if the first one has notoriously been known for his instigating skills, Achilles is often revered as the strongest Greek warrior with the noble veneer. In this novel he is just a ruthless killer with the amazing power.Because the traditional story of Troy with its eventual demise is always associated with the divine elements, this novel also has to do with the question of whimsical and petty Greek gods. The topic is daunting enough to handle from the very beginning due to the questionable nature of every deity, especially if the story is shaped by Fate and numerous prophecies. Ms. George manages to find a fine balance between the world of gods, demigods, and nymphs and the world of people. Theologically, it is more of a deistic approach; from the viewpoint of literature her gods do not influence the world of people much and their existence is harmoniously interwoven into the fabric of human life.The language is rich and extremely sensuous, the voice of the protagonist changes with the age of the heroine \u2013 from an innocent girl and later a bride to a desirable woman to a wife and grandmother. This voice convincingly conveys the messages that every woman can relate to even nowadays. Helen of Sparta, ofTroy, and ofSpartaagain is first and foremost a woman who finally finds some peace in the end of her life.There is also one more interesting point to consider \u2013 the book does not stop with the fall of Troy (though the biggest part is over); the narrator still continues exploring the lives of other people, involved into this historic tragedy. We learn about Andromache, Odysseus, Clytemnestra, Orestes, Electra, and Hermione.The book itself is not only based on the famous \u2018Iliad\u2019 but incorporates many other Greek myths and the plots of ancient tragedies by Aeschylus, Sophocles, and Euripides. Hence, both the serious research and extensive reading were the successful foundation for this culturally rich novel."}, {"userName": "Iset", "userReviewDate": "Mar 03, 2011", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/4973578-iset", "userReview": "In Helen of Troy, George loses none of her deft story-telling touch. Reading this book, or indeed any book by George, one can feel almost as something palpable that this story is truly woven \u2013 a rich tale of many complex strands woven expertly together by George\u2019s pen. What a joy! There\u2019s something gloriously gluttonous about curling up with a book like that and a mug of hot chocolate of a cold winter\u2019s evening and losing yourself for hours. Mind you, I read Helen of Troy whilst ensconced in the all-pervading heat and light, punctuated by the quenching respite of a cool sea breeze, of Crete in summertime, and maybe it was the Hellenistic location, but I felt transported in such a way that it seemed almost strange.One thing that George does so well is in imagining past places and people and rendering them so thoroughly and completely on the page. Her stories are always so rich and detailed, and she\u2019s an expert at filling in the gaps in history with compelling and yet believable material. Helen of Troy really feels like a sweeping epic too, maybe partly due to the tales\u2019 extensive history and place in the western consciousness, but a great deal of credit must go to Margaret George\u2019s skill as an author. I had read Bettany Hughes\u2019 comprehensive non-fiction work Helen of Troy before I picked up this novel, so I was more aware of the historical authenticity reading through this book, and although Helen is, as far as we currently know, a figure of myth, I was stunned at how George managed to incorporate almost every aspect of the legends involving Helen \u2013 even those seemingly contradictory tales \u2013 and took care to render the details of the Bronze Age setting with accuracy.I was particularly interested to see how George would handle the mythical elements of the legend, since I prefer my retellings of legends to either go whole hog with the fantasy or try to create a completely plausible historical version. George largely treats the tale in an historical manner, apart from the appearances of Aphrodite and the water nymph. I was slightly disappointed at this because she handles the other potentially mythical material in such a clever way, turning it into something historically plausible, could she not have done the same for Aphrodite and the water nymph? This book would have been truly fantastic to read as a complete historical epic.For the most part I loved the characters. Helen felt thoroughly fleshed out and very real, as did Paris, though he is not quite as fleshed out \u2013 but this adds to our sense of confusion alongside Helen when the couple experience the distress of unknowable rifts between them. Many of the characters felt so authentic, but they appear so infrequently in the story that I was a little disappointed and rather wanted to know more, characters such as Helen\u2019s siblings, Agamemnon, Menelaus, Achilles, Odysseus, Priam and Hecuba and their other children and so forth. The character of Gelanor was interesting, but at times felt a bit too engineered \u2013 and indeed he is an author-invented character.9 out of 10. A richly detailed, meticulous portrait of Helen of Troy set in a sweeping epic tale. For me, only let down by a few odd characters moments and the odd random inclusion of a couple of mythical elements when the rest of the story tries to be historical, but well worth the read. A definite keeper on my bookshelf."}, {"userName": "Karen", "userReviewDate": "Apr 24, 2013", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/2395059-karen", "userReview": "Although this latest historical fiction novel by Margaret George is not quite up to her first two efforts, \u201cThe Autobiography of Henry VIII\u201d and \u201cThe Memoirs of Cleopatra,\u201d she still does a very good job of making the mythical figure of Helen of Troy into a real, flesh-and-blood woman of her time that we can identify with.Unlike other fictional re-tellings of Helen\u2019s story which portray her as selfish and conceited or a vapid non-entity, George does her best to make Helen a sympathetic figure, who is conflicted about leaving her husband and child for Paris and tries to avert the war between the Trojans and Greeks that results from their actions. Although George portrays her characters as real people and firmly grounds them in the Mycenaean Greek culture that was the actual setting in which the Trojan War supposedly took place, she also includes the influences of the mythological gods that the people of this time believed in and who supposedly controlled their destiny. This continual referral to Zeus, Aphrodite, and Persephone and their control over Helen\u2019s actions sometimes seems out-of-place with the realistic tone that mainly characterizes George\u2019s narrative. Also, since Helen was basically an observer, rather than a direct participant, in some of the famous scenes of the Trojan War, George has also given her supernatural gifts of foresight and out-of-body experiences so that she can tell us of scenes that she could not have physically witnessed. This also mars the realistic treatment of this story. Cleopatra also believed in the influence of her gods, but when reading George\u2019s portrayal of her I never once felt that she was manipulated by them. George\u2019s Cleopatra, unlike her Helen of Troy, was always firmly in control of her own actions and destiny.However, since the whole concept of Helen of Troy and the Trojan War is mythical and not authenticated historical fact, I suppose I can\u2019t quibble too much about George choosing to inject elements of fantasy into her usual realistic interpretation. She still wrote a novel good enough to keep me reading to the end."}, {"userName": "Lady", "userReviewDate": "Feb 03, 2010", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/1690078-lady", "userReview": "I hoped that this would be an intriguing story that adds new depth to the characters and machinations of the Trojan War; that it would take what we already knew and make it interesting, give it depth and conflict and emotion so that it was still interesting. But I didn't feel that Margaret George did that at all. Since Helen of Troy is written from the first person point of view of Helen, she needed to be a compelling woman of intelligence and strength and force of will caught in the tides of love and politics and the gods and that would have been interesting. Unfortunately, Margaret George's Helen is nearly as paltry as other accounts have portrayed her, just more detailed.The love story wasn't strong enough to propel the world into war. I didn't fall in love with Paris and I needed to if I was going to understand why Helen loved him and left her child for him.The writing, I thought, was almost too simple and straight forward and despite how long the book is I felt it remained always on the surface of the story, skimming over moments and details without depth or weight or intrigue.Any story of historical fiction that examines a particular moment in time labors under the burden of an audience that already knows how it ends. In order to be worthy of the retelling the story needs to bring something new or exciting to what we know and I don't think Helen of Troy managed that."}, {"userName": "DeAnna", "userReviewDate": "Jul 13, 2011", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/1022641-deanna", "userReview": "I finally conquered Troy!Yesterday, before I read the last page of the book and the afterwords by the author, I was ready to rant and rave about how selfish and vapid Helen was and how ridiculous everyone seemed with their claims of seeing the future and being visited by gods every other day....then I learned that it's a good possibility that she never existed and is simply a myth. How can I get self-righteous with a myth?But seriously, I couldn't feel any sympathy for Helen and Paris. They should have known better. Paris was 16 so he was probably letting his hormones do the talking but Helen was a grown woman.She knew her brother-in-law was looking for a fight with Troy and so she runs away in the middle of the night with the Prince of Troy and was shocked that they would gather a vast army and invade? Please!She left her daughter behind and she left her parents to deal with the humiliation and we're supposed to swoon over the great love affair? Whatever, Helen!So, all ranting aside, this was a lovely read. Margaret George does an amazing job of transporting us back to a time that may or may not have existed. It seemed real to me.She gave each character such distinct personalities that they all came alive.However, the character of Helen and the authors interpretation of Cleopatra were very similar. I guess being queens of ancient lands, you'd imagine they'd have similar personalities or Margaret George has a formula for her ancient queens.I've got her story of Mary of Magdelene on my TBR list. Surely, Mary's character will be different.Bottom line: great read, enchanting writing."}, {"userName": "Sarenna", "userReviewDate": "Sep 17, 2008", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/1512721-sarenna", "userReview": "[I'm not going to say how long ago that was because I'm still trying to recover from my kids telling me that they would have hated living in \"the olden days\" when we had to go to the LIBRARY to research things from ENCYCLOPEDIAS because there was no INTERNET.

I have to say that I loved this book as much if not more as my first George book, Cleopatra. This was very well done and makes memories of high school headaches from reading the Iliad and the Odyssey not so horrible. George does a great job taking the story of the fall of Troy and the events leading up to it and making them enjoyable to read. I love they way she makes Helen so personable and not just this statuesque beauty that is merely a face and not much of a person that you can relate to as is done by other authors and historians. I got so wrapped up in the story of Helen's life - her love and loss, friendships and relationships with those close to her and those who hated her. It really was a beautiful telling of the life of Helen of Troy. George's take on Achilles is also very interesting and different from the glorification that you might remember from the movie Troy. If you can sink your teeth into a long read it is well worth it.

Her father soon passes down his role of king to Menelaus making Helen the Queen of Sparta.

This book is written in first person and Helen is narrating the story of her life. She is a very caring, sympathetic and innocent character in this book because we are hearing the story from her side. The writing is so fantastic you are immediately pulled in and can\u2019t wait to read more to see what happens (even though you know the end of the story).Helen is raised as a very sheltered young girl and is forbidden to use a mirror lest she see how beautiful she is. She longed for freedom and the ability to travel because her parents kept a very tight leash on her and she was seldom allowed to leave the castle. After she was married and had a daughter, she still longed to see the world beyond her kingdom. Once in Troy and the war began, the book dragged a little or maybe I was just tired of the war. The part Greek mythology played in the story was a little weak. Basically, when someone behaved badly, their excuse was \u201cthe gods made me do it\u201d.

Ah, the enigma of Helen of Troy. The men of ancient times are as captivated by Helen as we are today. Helen of Troy has been portrayed in many different lights and from many different angles.

I really enjoyed The Memoirs of Cleopatra, as it gripped me from page one. I didn't feel the page turning experience with this work. But, you cannot deny that George is a masterful storyteller. I think for me personally, although this should really be seen as a compliment, George brought Helen to life so well that I would find myself frustrated with the magical elements and the \"Helen couldn't help it because she was under the control of others (Aphrodite)\" elements. I would have to stop and remind myself, \"hey, Regina....this is mythology. That's part of it.\" After that I could get back into the flow, but it, unfortunately, distracted me from the experience.
