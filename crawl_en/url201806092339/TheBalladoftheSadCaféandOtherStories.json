Each one of them enhances a different aspect of thematic lines recurrent in McCullers\u2019 works: the isolation and the loneliness juxtaposed to selfless love in implausible triangular relationships. What distinguishes these stories from others is the musical quality so idiosyncratic of McCullers\u2019 voice along with the silent incursion of her evenly paced words into the minds of her figurative, and often outlandish, characters. The inner lives of these protagonists shape the dismal world they inhabit, breathing life into a reality that seems more feasible than if obtained from direct, plain observation or detailed description. And so the line separating fiction from reality softens, the vision becomes illumination, and maybe through exaggeration, maybe through the projection of a profoundly poetic prose, McCullers creates a universe built on ambiguity where melancholy abounds and an impending sense of loss intoxicates the senses of the reader.Following the tune of an unhurried narrative; characters are introduced, stripped naked, given distinctive traits that stir the lethargic child still hidden inside us who eagerly awaits to be swept off his feet by the end of a fantastic tale. But McCullers\u2019 ballads turn out to be composed for an adult public, for there is nothing tender or childish in the succession of desperate voices that sing to the stigmatized, the rejected, the abandoned who feed off their past failures and unrequited love.And so the sound of picks falling on stone marks the rhythm that unfolds the story of Miss Amelia, the androgynous owner of the Caf\u00e9 that is built upon her irrational devotion to her cousin Lymon, a destitute hunchback whose eyes bask on Marvin Macy\u2019s handsome features. Beethoven\u2019s Sonata No. 12 marks the end of Bienchen\u2019s future as a child prodigy with the piano in Wunderkind while Bach\u2019s prelude and fugue plays as a redeeming melody that allows The Sojourner to make peace with a lost love that still burns his soul in silence.The tapping of raindrops on a forgotten streetcar caf\u00e9 sets the pace for the story of a vagrant who has taught himself to love A Tree, A Rock, A Cloud  with utter selflessness, a \u201cscience\u201d that might alter the course of the life of a newspaper delivery boy for good.The micro-cosmos of the solitary singer expands and soaks the mood of the casual bystander, who can\u2019t help but remain glued to the desolate voices that interweave in a fugue of mismatched glances that search each other in vain. McCullers\u2019 characters sing in an adult world erected on cheated innocence, a lot of whisky and barren lands where loneliness is the only thing left after the music stopped playing. Isn\u2019t it incredible, though, that \u201dthe music, catalyst for this tumultuous anarchy, was so serene and clear\u201d and soothed a discomfited reader in spite of the desolate landscape? Not when McCullers is playing."}, {"userName": "Aubrey", "userReviewDate": "Oct 26, 2013", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/4119460-aubrey", "userReview": "4.5/5McCullers is one I come to for a reckoning, much as I do with Faulkner and O'Connor. One may bundle them up and slot them neatly under the label of Southern Gothic, but that is not a guaranteed invocation of cathedrals crazed by fecundity of both soil and symptom, an American way of the crooked cross where faith is a matter of lust and amputation. While Faulkner plunges in chiaroscuro and O'Connor sears in holy fire, McCullers sings in the twilight of a human soul, casting back on its years in search and always, always, coming up short. She is calmer than her two compatriots, but peace does not entail redemption.These stories are short, and I am not surprised that my favorite, Wunderkind, was composed at the age of seventeen. It's a common thing, the vicarious living of the parent through the child, the sapling broken before it even began along lines of another's making, for intelligence and art and college and any number of reasons but the one encompassing what it is the child actually wants, or dreams, or needs. When the body ripens and the mind begins to wander beyond the closed circuit court of parental promises of wealth and fame and glory, it's no wonder that the machine begins to break. But the child does not know that. What a child does know is their failure is made purely out internal system of self, and one way or another, breaking out or breaking down, they will escape. This is a tale that the median of youth and maturity knows, especially when one is Carson McCullers at seventeen.While that was my favorite, the rest are well worth it. All are a matter of living with those insanities we humans willingly inflict, for living is a must what with self-killing labeled as one of the more wicked sins. In the midst of souls and the relationships they wield as pitchforks, the damnation they deal is matched only by the bounty they reap, much as the sick sloth of Southern swamp and all its dead can only be graced by golden sunsets, etched into art by sprawling trees and more precious to the earth than all of humanity. The world bears us much as we bear our woes, a day by day of nearing and furthering reconciliation with too long a past to hope that sudden extinction would lead to instantaneous peace. Some moments are of utmost beauty, some are fit to kill, and one adapts accordingly.The world may grant us sanctuary, but it does not understand us, and will not miss us when we are gone. McCullers has no concrete structure for us to dwell in forevermore; what she does for us is feel."}, {"userName": "Paquita Maria Sanchez", "userReviewDate": "Aug 29, 2011", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/2508169-paquita-maria-sanchez", "userReview": "You know those authors; just when you think you've begun to catch your footing running up the landslide that is all the books and authors you want to read, someone trips you up by mentioning, I don't know, \"Carson McCullers,\" and suddenly you're all shaky-clenched fists and \"durmurt, foiled again!\" Well, (not Johnny) Carson (not Daily) McCullers, I know a bit about you now, and I think I could love you. *We have lost soul losers who keep on losing.*Not everyone is completely hollowed out by cyclical defeat and largely self-created and perpetuated doom, but most are because get real, amIright?*That fork in the road? Yeah, wrong way. I don't even have to look up and see which way you're going, because just no.*Don't do that.*Don't worry, everybody does that at one point or another.*Seriously, stop it.*Whiskey?This collection as a whole is like a panoramic view of a chipped wooden dive bar, with each story another sad sack with a heavy past clinging to his or her neck, head down, choking. The once-great artist, burnt out before adulthood; the dissatisfied, lonely housewife who has taken to the bottle in secret; the profound sadness of the pathological liar's psychosis; the old drunken man who has used his obsessive meditations on one particularly acute heartbreak to figure out that humans are doing love wrong, and that they should actually first become slowly and deeply smitten with all the commonplace things around them (A Tree, A Rock, A Cloud) before daring to take on another human being. \"They start at the wrong end of love. They begin at the climax. Can you wonder it is so miserable?\"For me, McCullers is just the right blend of hopelessness and hope. I look forward to our second date. Until then, I will try my best to love wholly and small.

The omniscient narrator's (balladeer's?) riffs on the lover and the beloved had me thinking of Proust, though the straightforward prose couldn't be more different from his.The main character of \"Wunderkind\", a story written when McCullers was 17 and showing the promise that would come to fruition with her first novel, is named Frances, leading me back to Frankie, as Frances is Frankie's given name as well. In \"Madame Zilensky and the King of Finland\" the former is tall, something I was starting to see as a given with McCullers' females, in the same way \"The Jockey\" continues the characterization started off with Cousin Lymon in \"Ballad\" of very short males. The stories set in New York -- \"The Sojourner\" and \"A Domestic Dilemma\" -- remind me of an early short story by William Maxwell called \"Homecoming\" (1938). Along with \"Ballad\", most of these stories depict the illogical impossibility of love with its inherent loneliness: the final story, \"A Tree, A Rock, A Cloud\", offers a possible, though unlikely, solution to the universal predicament of pain-filled, unrequited love."}, {"userName": "Eh?Eh!", "userReviewDate": "Apr 18, 2010", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/137273-eh-eh", "userReview": "I've noticed many folks who read and review literature on this site will namedrop other authors in a sort of Iron Chef flowery manner of description, knowing that other literary folk will instantly understand what is meant when saying 'this prose invokes a similar sense of spring as Lord Bigbeard With Tiny Spectacles, and a harmonious interplay of flavors identical to Oppressed In Her Time Strong Woman Author' (I swear every episode of Iron Chef used the spring and harmony phrases, it was like \"throbbing vulva\" or \"splay\" with that one romance novel). I want to play! But I haven't read enough literary greats to knowledgeably toss out names like this, so I'll go with the little I've got. Ahem: McCullers' slim volume of stories is reminiscent of Sherwood Anderson's wonderful Winesburg, Ohio with soul-wrenching insights, more grimly presented than the gentle I Capture the Castle by Dodie Smith, and nothing like Grunberg or Nabokov. There, I'm all played out.Whereas Anderson swung his wrench at all the nuts and bolts of the broken soul \u2013 isolation, trampled dreams, lost reputation, lost love, lost hope, lost independence, lost passions \u2013 McCullers seemed to wield her special-edition lady's wrench with padded pink handle only for the love part. Not that she wrote in a lesser manner, or that I could've been able to identify Carson McCullers as female until I saw her author photo inside the covers of other editions when I was browsing, just that love is stereotypically thought of as being a womanly emotion and her decision to write only about this one topic led me to dig this hole with no way to get out because I wanted to describe a pink-handled wrench to make fun of those stupid \"lady's toolkit\" that are smaller and more expensive as manufacturers try to play on gender differences for a profit...am I still in the hole? I do sort of believe that \"all you need is love\" and the rest will follow, but I would've liked to see what she had to say about the rest.There are a few different ways of properly tensioning high-strength bolts. The \"high-strength\" just means a stronger type of steel with restrictions on the variability allowed in the material strength, critical with things like steel buildings and bridges where the material properties need to be reliably uniform and, well, more. I glossed over the bolt-tensioning methods a few years back, when I had to pretend to be expert enough to inspect some repairs (but I'm positive the ironworkers knew I was frontin' when they had to correct my lingo, sigh). Let me teach you! All the tensioning methods boil down to requiring a certain amount of rotation to achieve the right amount of tension. Since high-strength bolt material doesn't have a well-defined yield point, there's no accurate way of...I think I've lost most people here. Okay, the required rotations had to be empirically calibrated for...no, that's even more boring. You need to give the wrench a half-turn of the nut. Too simple? ...moving on.The title story was the longest, a novelette or novella (I wish there were word/page counts for these so I could use the right word). A strong unfeminine woman gave her love to her leeching hunchback cousin but then loses all when a rejected lover returns. Lovely passage: But though the outward facts of this love are indeed sad and ridiculous, it must be remembered that the real story was that which took place in the soul of the lover himself. So who but God can be the final judge of this or any other love? Feeling: more than half a turn, overtensioned.\"Wunderkind\" \u2013 A young pianist prodigy finds she'd lost whatever it was that brought emotion to her music (love of music? in the swirl of adolescence?). I was forced to take piano lessons for a long time after losing the fun so I was indifferent at best to playing, but there was this one time I finished a piece and my teacher told me I'd had a very nice interpretation of it. Huh? I was just trying to hit the notes until the end, but I had somehow managed to vary the speed and volume in a way that sounded pleasing? She could've been throwing me a bone, because I'd been playing a number of years and couldn't get past the mechanics; I wondered about that for a long time, and still do, whether I really had played well or whether it was an accident, and what it would be like if I could do that deliberately. What would it be like if I could do that deliberately, and then lost that ability? Would it hurt? Lovely passage: 'Do you know how many children Bach had?' 'A good many. Twenty some odd.' 'Well then \u2013, he could not have been so cold \u2013 then.' Feeling: half a turn, but undertensioned somehow.\"The Jockey\" \u2013 The shortest and vaguest, and I found it to be the most powerful. The jockey's hurt is just barely limned in narration by 3 other characters, in their exchanged words, in the description of his behaviors, but oh, his grief!, a dry-eyed rage pounding the air. Lovely passage: nothing I could pluck out. Feeling: half a turn, perfect.\"Madame Zilensky and the King of Finland\" \u2013 The head of a music department, his life simple and direct, hires a new instructor who tells outlandish tales. Lovely passage: Day and night she had drudged and struggled and thrown her soul into her work, and there was not much of her left over for anything else. Being human, she suffered from this lack and did what she could to make up for it.... Through the lies, she lived vicariously. The lies doubled the little of her existence that was left over from work and augmented the little rag end of her personal life. Feeling: under half a turn, undertensioned.\"The Sojourner\" \u2013 A man who had just flown home for his father's funereal chances to meet his ex-wife and sees the family and life he might have had if he'd stayed with her. To go through life, and then second guess? A nightmare! Lovely passage: It was a Madonna loveliness, dependent on the family ambiance. Feeling: a resentfully granted half a turn, correctly tensioned I guess.\"Domestic Dilemma\" \u2013 An evening in the life of a working man who has an alcoholic stay-at-home wife and worries about his small children. A passage I disagree with: Absorbed in the instant \u2013 the tooth, the bath, the quarter \u2013 the fluid passage of child-time had borne these weighless episodes like leaves in the swift current of a shallow stream while the adult enigma was beached and forgotten on the shore. No. So wrong. Children remember everything. They may not show it right away, they may act the way they usually do, but those shouted arguments between mommy and daddy aren't forgotten. Feeling: over half a turn, undertensioned.\"A Tree, A Rock, A Cloud\" \u2013 First you need to grow and become strong before you soar? I interpret things too literally. Lovely passage: They start at the wrong end of love. They begin at the climax. Can you wonder it is so miserable? Feeling: maybe half a turn?, I think it's correctly tensioned?Literary fiction is exhausting. When there are lasers or magic or talking animals, I can tune down the introspection and enjoy a story with a quick one-sentence lesson thrown in - entertainment. Lit-fic waves a wrench threateningly in my direction and forces a magnifying glass solely inward. It's good, to consider oneself and place in the world, what I'm going to be when I grow up, how do I view and treat others, think about situations I've never faced but be able to have empathy for those who have...the real world can be just as bizarre but too real in a way that I unthinkingly absorb and file information. At first I was feeling that MuCullers' characters were more outlandish than necessary until I began remembering some of the people I've known and their misfortunes (to keep the theme of the book, misfortunes with love): I had this one babysitter when I was 5 who would make up and sing lullabies to her 2 babies; 20 years later I saw in the newspaper that she was in jail for murdering her husband. My 6th grade teacher went on to become a full-time police officer and then county sheriff; I saw a newspaper article last year that he was resigning in disgrace after it was discovered that he'd used his office for an adulterous affair. I heard about college classmate S. in the news, when it was reported that he'd been murdered; he'd been dating the ex-gf of his best friend but that friend shot him and her and killed himself. These are all so horrible! How could I forget them? But if I had these at the forefront of my thoughts, I would be crazy. Crazier. Visibly crazier. Isn't it a survival mechanism, to forget? But important to remember. Lit-fic's wrench to the rescue.Something less wrench-ing (yuk yuk) next."}, {"userName": "Melanie", "userReviewDate": "Feb 20, 2011", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/4093022-melanie", "userReview": "There is a dark, syrupy sway to Carson's work that I've always been a sucker for.

'the hunchback' character arrives like a tornado, bringing the townsfolk & Miss Amelia out of their small town slumber, to an inevitablely cruel conclusion.The other short stories are great too, but The Ballad is really a stand alone Giant."}, {"userName": "L.A.

All are entertaining reading, focusing as they do on unusual characters and situations.From a literary viewpoint, Ballad is the most interesting because rather than a single character confronting him/herself or two characters confronting one another, it features a genuine triangle. None of the three characters is particularly appealing but readers will still be sympathetic to the roundabout of unrequited love.The remaining stories are interesting character studies, sometimes ending with a twist.

Have yet to receive a reply. ***************************************STORY 1The Ballad of the Sad Caf\u00e9 :3 starsWhat I liked was the feel of the town. It was an entity in itself. The townspeople are not individuals, but a group. Often people behave differently as part of a group than when each feels themselves on their own! The story and what happens in this small southern town is atmospherically told. It is the atmosphere drawn that I enjoyed most. There are three central characters: Miss Amelia (shop/caf\u00e9 owner), Marvin Macy (Amelia\u2019s hated and deposed earlier husband) and Lymon (Amelia\u2019s cousin, a dwarf hunchback). Their behavior didn\u2019t make sense to me, even when seen in the light of the novella\u2019s central theme - the difference between being a lover versus the beloved. Group behavior felt spot-on, but not the individuals\u2019 behavior. Maybe I analyze too much. The audiobook narration was slow and atmospheric, impossible to improve upon. I like slow.***************************************Story 2Wunderkind:5 starsWow, I am not musical and still I understood the agony of the story\u2019s fifteen-year-old who no longer could play the piano as she had before. Her heart and soul knew how the music was to be played\u2026\u2026..but her fingers just no longer could. Heart-wrenching. Oh, I wanted the teacher to talk to her, to comfort her, to give her encouragement. This has to be quasi-autobiographical. The author had wanted to study at Juliard. Again, absolutely marvelous narration. This story is very short. :0(****************************************Story 3The Jockey1 starThis was ridiculously short! How can I \u201cjudge\u201d a situation or the people if I know scarcely a thing about them? None of the characters seemed at all pleasant or interesting. Narration OK. ****************************************Story 4Madame Zalenski and the King of FinlandNarrator: Suzanne Toren4 starsNot that I understood all of this, but it certainly made me laugh! After completion I thought and thought how to make sense of what I had been told. You CAN have a democracy in a land with a king. Still, Finland is a democracy but has no king! And dogs CAN walk backwards\u2026..perhaps. Who is the crazy one?! I liked how this is written; it makes me curious and is amusing. Excellent narration. ****************************************Story 5The Sojourner2 starsSomebody close dies and of course you stop and rethink your own life. Narration and story just OK.***************************************Story 6A Domestic Dilema3 starsA touching glimpse at the problems caused by alcohol in a young family. Could Carson McCullers have said more in a longer novel? She said a lot here with few words. Good narration. ***************************************Story 7A Tree, a Rock, a Cloud3 starsYeah, I liked this one too. The theme? The difficulties of loving a woman. A brief talk between a paperboy, the owner of an all-night streetcar caf\u00e9 and an old faded redhead. Carson McCullers paints pictures with words. Then she leaves a thought to think upon. Start by loving something simpler. Good narration.****************************************Three stars for the whole book. Some stories are better than others. You get glimpses into the worlds of others, and you start thinking. Always good writing. I prefer long novels over short stories and novellas, even when the writing is as good as this."}, {"userName": "\u03a4\u03bf \u0386\u03c3\u03c7\u03b7\u03bc\u03bf \u03a1\u03cd\u03b6\u03b9

Similar in tone to ' The Heart is a Lonely Hunter' though this was less melancholic but carried a bit more menace, and at only eighty five pages each and everyone of them were pure gold!.

Whether it be their heartache and trying to find ways to cope with what life has given them or their random birth into a low class of society that has kept them in a state of ignorant bliss, you find that the characters speak to the reader, but not in an overwhelming way. That underlying sadness is sometimes so subtle that it doesn't quite make me feel as much as many others sad prose, hence why my rating isn't higher.Don't get me wrong, her writing is top notch; put her side by side with many authors in the last 100 years and she'd probably be in the upper echelon of the category.All of these stories are generally good, but I'd recommend Wunderkind, The Sojourner and A Domestic Dilemma (my favorite) as the top 3 in this collection. The novella which the book is named for is nice, but could've easily been shortened for maximum effect."}, {"userName": "Sue", "userReviewDate": "Jul 05, 2010", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/3642045-sue", "userReview": "This is an excellent collection, with the titled novella being my favorite and having some truly wonderful prose throughout. It struck me as a southern tall tale crossed with that terrible \"love gone wrong\" plus Southern Gothic. So many parts equal a glorious whole for the reader if not for Miss Amelia.The descriptions of the caf\u00e9 and the changes wrought on the town and its inhabitants are exciting to read, so full of life.But the pride that the caf\u00e9 brought to this town had an effect on almost everyone, even the children. For in order to come to the caf\u00e9 you did not have to buy the dinner, or a  portion of liquor. There were cold bottled drinks for a nickel. And if you could not even afford that, Miss Amelia had a drink called Cherry Juice which sold for a penny a glass, and was pink-colored and very sweet. Almost everyone, with the exception of Reverend T. M. Willin, came to the caf\u00e9 at least once during the week. Children love to sleep in houses other than their own, and to eat at a neighbor's table; on such occasions they behave themselves decently and are proud. The people in the town  were likewise proud when sitting at the tables in the caf\u00e9. They washed before coming to Miss Amelia's, and scraped their feet very politely on the threshold as they entered the caf\u00e9. There, for a few hours at least, the deep bitter knowing that you are not worth much in this world could be laid low. (p 54)But of course this is more than the tale of a town and a caf\u00e9 and Miss Amelia. It's also the tale of the hunchback dwarf, Cousin Lymon, and the one Marvin Macy. If you are not familiar with them, you must read the story!Of the other stories included in tis collection, my favorites are \"Wunderkind\" and \"The Sojourner\". Heartsick lovers and outsiders people her stories and seem to be searching for other places and people.

Miss Amelia Evans is a six foot two inch rugged woman. She's the owner of a general store, and does a bit of healing with herbs on the side to help the townspeople. They gossip about her ten day marriage to Marvin Macy which ended after she refused his sexual advances. Marvin left town for a life of crime, and landed in the penitentiary.A hunchback dwarf, Lymon Willis, comes to the store professing to be Miss Amelia's cousin. Miss Amelia takes him in, and they turn the store into a bright cafe where the townspeople socialize. Although Lymon seems to be a parasite, Miss Amelia loves him and seems happy living with him. When Marvin gets out of jail, Lymon is fascinated by him and ignores Miss Amelia. A triangular love relationship is formed where the beloved does not love the person who loves them. Carson McCullers had a troubled marriage with her spouse who had a male lover. She would certainly understand the dynamics of a triangular relationship, and the devastation that could result. There are a wonderful pages in the book, too long to quote here, about the relationship between the beloved and the loved.The book also contained six short stories about love:\"Wunderkind\" is about a promising young pianist who loses her emotional feel for the music. (McCullers had taken piano lessons for years before giving it up when her piano teacher moved when her husband had a job relocation.)\"The Jockey\" focuses on the emotions felt by an older jockey when he sees the indifference of a group of businessmen to the news that his friend, a younger jockey, has a permanent injury. The businessmen are only concerned about money and winning, not personal tragedy.\"Madame Zelensky and the King of Poland\" is about a musician who tells exaggerated stories. Her real life has no time for anything but the music she loves, so she invents a personal life.\"The Sojourner\" tells about a man who sees his ex-wife and her new happy family. He realizes he needs a life with deeper meaning.\"A Domestic Dilemma\" involves a husband coming home from work to find his wife drunk again, and the children unattended. How much will his young, beloved children remember about her behavior, and can their marriage last? McCullers writes about the \"immense complexity of love\" in this story.\"A Tree, A Rock, A Cloud\" shows a drunk man telling a paperboy about the science of love. After losing the love of a woman, he decided to start loving again on a small scale, loving a tree, a rock, a cloud.

This was my second approach to McCullers's work, and I can say, beyond a shadow of a doubt, that I've become one of her admirers. I'm the kind of reader that tends to put the characters and the human element above the story line and everything else, so I'm always amazed by authors who get it, and it's obvious that McCullers is one of them. She understands loneliness. She understands love. She understands pain. And that, the deep comprehension of people's feelings and behaviors is what makes her, in my opinion, one of the great writers of the past century.***Hermoso, hermoso libro. Esta fue mi segunda aproximaci\u00f3n a la obra de McCullers y puedo decir, sin duda alguna, que me he convertido en una de sus admiradoras.Pertenezco a ese tipo de lectores que tiende a poner los personajes y el elemento humano por sobre la historia y todo lo dem\u00e1s, por lo que siempre me sorprenden los autores que lo entienden, y es obvio que McCullers es una de ellos. Ella entiende la soledad. Entiende el amor. Entiende el dolor.

Its protagonist, Miss Amelia, had no use for others except \u201cto make money out of them,\u201d and she had a \u201cpassion for lawsuits and the courts\u201d (5). She keeps her expelled kidney stones in a box (35); she only liked to discuss \u201cinterminable subjects,\u201d such as \u201cthe stars, the reason why Negroes are black, the best treatment for cancer\u201d (36). After opening to a description of how awful the town is in the present, the story flashes back to \u201ca night when it is good to hear from faraway, across the dark fields, the slow song of a Negro on his way to make love\u201d (5). (Yeah, I\u2019m scratching my head, too.) Into the scene strolls xenos, \u201crare that a stranger enters the town on foot at that hour\u201d and \u201cbesides, the man was a hunchback\u201d (6). Dude claims to be cousin to Amelia and then starts weeping, at which point the townies compare him with a \u201cquick, skipping little Jew who cried if you called him a Christ-killer\u201d (9). \u2026wut? (This guy, \u2018Cousin Lymon,\u2019 is likely the prototype for another very intelligent, sociable, libidinous person in literature who also happens to be afflicted with dwarfism.)When she takes the guy into her home, the townies are surprised, and then they begin to think, after a while, that perhaps she has murdered him. What\u2019s interesting is that the townies \u201cconvened on the porch\u201d whereupon \u201cthere will come a moment when all together they will act in unison, not from thought or from the will of any one man, but as though their instincts merged together so that the decision belongs to no single one of them, but to the group as a whole\u201d (15). Welcome to democracy, I suppose, townies? (This is specifically regarded as a \u201cdelegation on the porch\u201d (16).)The narrative develops such that \u201cthese two were living in sin\u201d (25), and thereafter follows a thoughtful cogitation on love as a \u201cjoint experience\u201d (id.), wherein the lover \u201ccomes a know a new, strange loneliness\u201d (26) and \u201cis forever trying to strip bare his beloved\u201d (id.). Protocol of reading disclosed in \u201cif a message is written with lemon juice on a clean sheet of paper there will be no sign of it. But if the paper is held for a moment to the fire then the letters turn brown and the meaning becomes clear. Imagine that the whisky is the fire and the message is that which is known only in the soul\u201d (10). Not sure how that works with the cogitation on love or with the narrative that follows.The narrator identifies Amelia, as proprietor, as \u201ccause of all this\u201d (22) in discussing the caf\u00e9, adopting the normal bourgeois mysticism of attributing causation of events to mere ownership of property involved therewith. She had been previously married, and not obviously divorced, to a thuggish dude whom she kicked out after ten days (\u201cA groom is in a sorry fix when he is unable to bring his well-beloved bride to bed with him, and the whole town knows it\u201d (31)). Husband \u201chad chopped off the tails of squirrels\u201d and \u201ccarried forbidden marijuana weed\u201d (27); he apparently \u201cdegraded and shamed\u201d young women around the town. Despite this, the townies wanted her to marry the thug because it might \u201cchange her at last into a calculable woman\u201d (30), which is supergross. And despite the grossness, \u201cthe town laughed a long time over this grotesque affair\u201d (33)\u2014so, yeah, they\u2019re all worthless Trump-voting types.When the husband returns after many years, and is considered \u201cthe cause of all this\u201d (51), we likely can refer back to the prior misattribution of causation as a reference. After that, everything is a cock-eyed fuck, difficult to assess, but damned interesting.The volume also contains some of McCullers\u2019 shorts; they\u2019re cool, but not the main event here.Recommended for readers who glory in conjunctions which are ill-matched and pitiful, persons who know the intimate business of everybody, and those who keep in mind the cheapness of human life."}, {"userName": "Mosca", "userReviewDate": "May 15, 2012", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/1837675-mosca", "userReview": "..................................Although I live today in the rural Southwestern US, I was born and bred in the american South. I left in 1975 at the age of 25. There was/is much to become alienated with about the South; the racism, the right-wing idealogies, the chauvanism, the narrow-minded parochialism. But there is much to love also: The vast and complex flora--springtime lasts five months; and each week there seem to be at least four different varieties of flowers in bloom! The lay of the small towns and farms. The food! And, of course the language with its own vocabulary, pronunciations,... and its own rhythms.This novella \"The Ballad of the Sad Cafe\" reads like it is a relic of the Southern oral tradition. It is easy to imagine oneself on a porch in the summer evening listening to a storyteller with a rich melodious voice going on and on..., pointing down the road, moving the arms, looking up at the stars, wistfully sighing....Every word seems to come out of Carson McCuller's mouth personally, carefully, wickedly, lovingly, despairingly,wryly,....like a ballad. Indeed this tragic ballad ends with a short, two-paragraph prose/poem called \"The Twelve Mortal Men\" that recalls a prison road gang seen distantly down the road singing a call/response as they work the county road.But much much earlier, you hear a ballad as the plot slowly weaves itself into a pattern, and holds you in its trance...for a while... and later it begins, inevitably, to unravel before you. There's nothing you can do to hold the pattern together; it unravels of its own energy, spinning across the tale...until there it is, only loose threads and memories.You are invited to listen to this tale, ... and this ballad."}, {"userName": "Kiwi Begs2Differ  \u270e", "userReviewDate": "Aug 28, 2014", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/12287031-kiwi-begs2differ", "userReview": "I liked the eponymous novella and \u201cA Domestic Dilemma\u201d, other stories not so much, 3 stars is the overall rating for the collection."}, {"userName": "Ctgt", "userReviewDate": "Mar 13, 2014", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/3787451-ctgt", "userReview": "This title popped up as one of my group reads but having read none McCullers' work I wasn't sure if I should start with a collection of shorts or hold out for The Heart is a Lonely Hunter(which has been on my tbr for quite some time).

Some really wonderful stories!The title story, \"Ballad\" was the longest(short, novella or novelette, I'd love to hear someone explain the difference) and my favorite from the book. Miss Amelia, an independent, headstrong, no nonsense woman is confronted with a dilemma after a hunchback named Lymon shows up in town claiming to be her cousin. We watch with the town as their relationship grows and seems unassailable until the return of Marvin Macy, Miss Amelia's husband, who after ten days of marriage was unceremoniously kicked out of the home and Amelia's life.

Such a person has an instinct which is usually found only in small children, an instinct to establish immediate and vital contact between himself and all things in the world. Certainly the hunchback was of this type.\u201d\u201cFor the atmosphere of a proper caf\u00e9 implies these qualities: fellowship, the satisfactions of the belly, and a certain gaiety and grace of behaviour.\u201d\u201cMarvin Macy, had no shame in him. He was seen everywhere. During working hours he loafed about the mill, looking in at the windows, and on Sundays he dressed in his red shirt and paraded up and down the road with his guitar. He was still handsome-with his brown hair, his red lips, and his broad strong shoulders; but the evil in him was now too famous for his good looks to get him anywhere. And this evil was not measured only by the actual sins he had committed. True, he had robbed those filling stations. And before he had ruined the tenderest girls in the county, and laughed about it. Any number of wicked things could be listed against him, but quite apart from these crimes there was about him a secret meanness that clung to him almost like a smell. Another thing-he never sweated, not even in august, and that surely is a sign worth pondering over.\u201d\u201cBut no value has been put on human life; it is given to us free and taken without being paid for. What is it worth? If you look around, at times the value may seem to be little or nothing at all. Often after you have sweated and tried and things are not better for you, there comes a feeling deep down in the soul that you are not worth much.\u201d\nThere are other stories in here, i did not really find them that interesting except one great little story\nA Domestic Dilemma\n A mans dilemma a family situation of sorts. He has a wife that has a drinking problem and that is ruining all that is good for him and the children. You feel the sadness, the emptiness and helplessness presented in the families dilemma.\n\u201cAbsorbed in the instant-the tooth, the bath, the quarter-the fluid passage of child-time had borne these weightless episodes like leaves I the swiff current of a shallow stream while the adult enigma was beached and forgotten on the shore. Martin thanked the lord for that. But his own anger, repressed and lurking, arose again. His youth was being frittered by a drunkard\u2019s waste, his very manhood subtly undermined. And the children, once the immunity of incomprehension passed- what would it be like in a year or so? With his elbows on the table he ate his food brutishly, untasting. There was no hiding truth-soon there would be gossip in the office and in the town; his wife was a dissolute woman. Dissolute. and he and his children were bound to a future of degradation and slow ruin.\u201d"}, {"userName": "Maria", "userReviewDate": "May 15, 2016", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/2262926-maria", "userReview": "I bought this book somewhere in Frankfurt while attending the famous Frankfurter Buchmesse (which was quite an extraordinary experience, by the way). There was a 5 books 5 euro deal going on and The Ballad of the Sad Caf\u00e9 and Other Stories was my fifth. I knew nothing about its author or its content, but the title seemed to call out for me.There, for a few hours at least, the deep bitter knowing that you are not worth much in this world could be laid low.The Ballad of the Sad Caf\u00e9 was, without a doubt, my favorite. There is something unusual, and rather endearing, about the narrator\u2019s voice. I love how effortlessly it travels across time and space; it\u2019s truly wonderful how it flows so naturally, even while going back and forth. It feels like you are on a guided tour of the universe and, in a Jurassic Park sort of way, you are stopped and told this very particular story that seems to be both the birthstone and the deathbed of this rather eccentric town that is now somewhat\u2026 extinct. There\u2019s a certain delicacy in the writing that lulls you into a state that makes it impossible to walk away from these characters. You become a witness to their existence and they remain alive within you.Therefore, the value and quality of any love is determined solely by the lover himself.It is for this reason that most of us would rather love than be loved. Almost everyone wants to be the lover. And the curt truth is that, in a deep secret way, the state of being beloved is intolerable to many. The beloved fears and hates the lover, and with the best of reasons. For the lover is forever trying to strip bare his beloved. The lover craves any possible relation with the beloved, even if this experience can cause him only pain.I also enjoyed Wunderkind. I love how the main character seemed to be somehow living in the shadow of her own past, soon becoming it, something immaterial with no capability of feeling.His own life seemed so solitary, a fragile column supporting nothing amidst the wreckage of the years.I can\u2019t possibly go without mentioning The Sojourner. I found it to be heart-wrenching. The writing is so\u2026 precious.Strange that the music, catalyst for this tumultuous anarchy, was so serene and dear.I didn\u2019t know anything about Carson McCullers (her passion for music is evident, though) before, but now I am certainly going to look into her body of work. There\u2019s something truly magical about her."}, {"userName": "Sherril", "userReviewDate": "Jan 27, 2017", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/21106693-sherril", "userReview": "Stories by Carson McCullers, reason enough to read them. I started reading Ballad of the Sad Cafe and Other Stories for two reasons. 1. Carson McCullers had authored them and she had written two of my all time favorite books, The Member of the Wedding (read recently) and The Heart is a Lonely Hunter (read in high school). 2. Though I prefer novels to short stories, I couldn't pass up a book with the title, The Ballad of the Sad Cafe. These stories were definitely more revealing of the author's quirkiness than were my two much loved novels. Quirkiness aside, I could read Carson McCullers for her language alone. From the story from which the book gets its name - \"It was toward midnight on the soft quiet evening in April. The sky was the color of blue swamp Iris, the moon clear and bright\".\"Down by the creek the square brick factory was yellow with light\". \"His face was both soft and sassy\". \"It was not a common thing to have an unknown hunchback walk to the store at midnight and then sit down and cry\". --why, I'd sleep like I was drowned in warm axle grease\". \"Stumpy MacPhail\". These were just some of the characters in Miss Amelia's liquor filled Sad Cafe. There were only \"3 good people\" and \"The room was still as death\". This story and most of the others put me in mind of O Henry's stories in their artful turn of phrases, unique language and quirkiness of characters and circumstances. There is humor, drama, ridiculousness, an \"interior life that is insufficient without the artifice of alcohol\" and an absurd little tale about a callous cafe owner, a man who may or may not be crazy who tells a young boy wearing an aviator type helmet that he loves him. Like most of McCullers stories, they are about loneliness and love and love loss. However, none of the stories hold a candle to the novels, The Heart is a Lonely Hunter or my favorite, The Member of the Wedding, but they are written by Carson McCullers, reason enough to read them."}], "description": "A classic work that has charmed generations of readers, this collection assembles Carson McCullers\u2019s best stories, including her beloved novella \u201cThe Ballad of the Sad Caf\u00e9.\u201d A haunting tale of a human triangle that culminates in an astonishing brawl, the novella introduces readers to Miss Amelia, a formidable southern woman whose caf\u00e9 serves as the town\u2019s gathering place.
