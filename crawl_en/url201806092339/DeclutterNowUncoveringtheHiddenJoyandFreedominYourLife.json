There are two things that make it unique. The first thing is that God is brought into the equation. Scriptures and godly principles are woven throughout the entire book. They are not merely \u201ctacked on\u201d either.Secondly, this book is not just about decluttering stuff. No, it is about decluttering every area of your life, including your relationships, finances, career, parenting, physical health care, thought life, and yes, your stuff.I found the authors\u2019 real life stories to be refreshingly authentic and they were aptly placed within the appropriate topic.There were questions to get you thinking, and even in some ways, some of the ideas were challenging, in a good way.And instead of overwhelm by so many ideas, I felt hope, that this could actually be done.Chances are that you have at least one area of your life that is cluttered, in confusion or in overwhelm. If that\u2019s the case, give this book a look! It could be just what you need.Disclosure of Material Connection: I received this book free from the authors themselves. I was not required to write a positive review. The opinions I have expressed are my own.

Each chapter builds on the last, but they are also independent, so I was able to skim one chapter and thoroughly read the next that felt more applicable to what God was dealing with in my heart without feeling like I'd missed something.The authors also covered life areas well, from physical clutter in our homes, to relationship clutter, to work and schedule clutter. And I loved the chapter on teaching our children to the evaluate clutter in their lives, training them up in this life analysis so it's normal for them and not a life-overhaul like it is for me!Everything they recommended was backed up with solid reasoning and great Scripture. But none of it felt forced or condescending. As I read the chapters, I felt like I was sitting in their living room and they were talking to me from their life experience, mentors passing on what they had learned. And not all of it was learned easily. Within the pages of the book they share mistakes and struggles as well as successes.If life feels stressed out and overwhelming, this might be a great book for you. I would recommend that even if you just want to tweak some things but aren't sure how to proceed, to check out this book. I don't think you'll be disappointed!"}, {"userName": "Kathy Barnett", "userReviewDate": "Jul 12, 2014", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/33007946-kathy-barnett", "userReview": "This was an amazing book! Truly a gem among must reads for everyone! My husband and I had been wanting to do a devotional-type study together and this one was perfect. It was easy for each of us to read and follow with the companion workbook. We did a chapter a week and planned a \"home\" date to discuss what we each felt we had seen/learned through that week's reading. One of the things I truly loved was that it spoke to both my husband and myself in different ways. Each of us realized we had areas in our lives that God wanted to help us \"declutter\". It wasn't just about getting more organized with our house and things, but it was truly about learning to prioritize our lives and focus on those things that are the most important to us with regards to our time and the people we love. I can't recommend strongly enough how much I think this book would benefit anyone who reads it."}, {"userName": "Holly (2 Kids and Tired)", "userReviewDate": "Nov 03, 2012", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/584266-holly-2-kids-and-tired", "userReview": "When I start underlining and marking pages within just the preface, I know this is going to be a good book. Declutter Now!, written by a husband and wife team, is full of tips and suggestions for getting ride of not only the physical clutter in our lives, but the clutter that comes from complacency, bad habits, relationships and more. The book is broken down into chapters and is easily read in a couple of sittings and you can just pick it up and work on a chapter or two at a time. We don't collect clutter in a day and getting ride of the excesses in life isn't something that is going to happen in a day, each area takes work. Much like remodeling a house, you work on one room at a time and Lindon and Sherry advocate that. The narrative is easy and you feel like you're having a conversation with the authors as they share their insights with scriptures and biblical principles."}, {"userName": "Sally Ferguson", "userReviewDate": "Nov 04, 2013", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/25294957-sally-ferguson", "userReview": "Does your \u201cstuff\u201d suffocate you? Declutter Now! tackles not only the process of paring down, but also the motivations that cause us to fill our lives with more than we need. Systematically tackling areas of home, work and relationships, the authors ask the hard questions of priorities. When our value systems set boundaries around our time and energies, the authors assert that we have more of what\u2019s needed for the things in life that are most important.Lindon and Sherry Gareis are the authors, and they speak from their own struggles with marriage, health and parenting. Their insights are gleaned from trial and error in the trenches of life. They have become certified Christian Life Coaches because of their desire to help others achieve physical and emotional freedom from the baggage of guilt, a lack of forgiveness and negativity.Lindon and Sherry use basic principles of decluttering to tackle a variety of topics. Nothing\u2019s off limits when it comes to paring down, and they have even broached subjects of finance, schedules, church commitments, \u201cstinkin\u2019 thinkin\u2019 and contentment. As with any book, choose the pieces you want to apply and leave the rest. However, you will benefit greatly in taking action on the advice they offer, as each step moves you closer to your goal. Noteworthy are the reminders to do regular self-assessments. i.e. Think about what you\u2019re purchasing and why. Is it to fill an emotional void or a physical need? Are you responsible for the stuff you already have? Do you manage your stuff or does it control you? Do you expect your stuff to make you happy? Does your busy calendar prevent you from being available to do the things God is nudging you to do? And that, the authors say, is the most important end result of decluttering: to make more time and freedom for God. \u201cYou should have less in your life of what doesn\u2019t matter, so you have the ability to make room for what does.\u201d (p. 221)Disclaimer: I received this book as a giveaway in exchange for a fair and honest review."}, {"userName": "Daphne Self", "userReviewDate": "Jun 07, 2013", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/5552166-daphne-self", "userReview": "This isn't just a book about Decluttering your house and home, oh, no. This is a book that goes way beyond that.Declutter Now! starts off small, hitting the physical, and then it takes you into the spiritual and emotional side of the psyche.At the moment of this review, I am only halfway through this book. It's that good and that well written that I had to write a review for it. Taken in small steps, I am slowly doing away with the baggage of the \"extras\" in my life that is leaving me burdened and un-joyful.Declutter Now! offers insights into the authors' lives, giving examples and testimonies. This isn't just a self-help book. This is a \"we'll help you\" book. Lindon and Sherry Gareis not only takes the reader step by step through the decluttering process of the home and life, but shows how and what is the most important in life...and it isn't possessions and material goods. The accumulation of things and bad habits and loss of focus drowns most people in this world, tying them down.

To quote the author, \"it isn't that life is too short, it's that life is to long to live with unhappiness or regret.\" I found my life needs to be filled with good solid strong relationships, prayer, the Holy Ghost and all things Christ centered.

This quote speaks the truth. Life can be challenging, from work and kids to relationships. Declutter Now! provides a guide in how to make a paradigm shift in decluttering your life. Clutter shows up in different ways - from guilt and depression to fear; it all depends on how you receive it into your life. Take relationships, for example. The Gareis\u2019 show us the various types of unhealthy, cluttering relationships that can greatly impact our lives - from regret, frustration, obligation, being the victim, to shame. To further hit the nail on the head, once you review the chapter titles you will begin to see the true value of this book and why decluttering your life is a crucial step to healing.I enjoyed reading Declutter Now!: Uncovering the Hidden Joy and Freedom in Your Life by Lindon and Sherry Gareis because it encourages freedom. When we are bound by clutter, there is usually a root cause for it. If that clutter is not pulled out at the root, it begins to fester into other things like health issues, financial disasters, toxic relationships and unruly children. Being honest with yourself and willing to do the work necessary to make a change is key.

Wisdom from God is a guide for all the areas in our lives, and this book helps put it all in perspective.Not only does it help us as adults, but it also shows ways we can teach our children the same principles to help them grow into balanced adults.It's hard not to have tears in your eyes at the end of this book: tears of realization that your life could be better, tears of joy to know that God wants to help you declutter your life, but most of all, tears of hope, that your life can be so much better in the future with God's help.
