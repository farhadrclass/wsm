They claim that this series is sexist, mainly because of the character of Hattie Durham. That is ridiculous, not only because such women exist in the world, but especially because there are other female characters (Chloe, for example) who do not behave in this manner. Additionally, there are male characters who have impure sexual motives as well. So, calling this book sexist is utterly unfounded. Secondly, they have called this book \"racist.\" Now that I didn't get at all, since race is not even mentioned in this book... so I can't fight fire with fire when there isn't any fuel. And lastly, they claimed that this book is \"offensive to anyone who isn't a born-again Christian.\" Well, I'm not. I'm Catholic, and I'm not offended. But I also have more than half a brain to think with.The authors' theology does come on a bit strong -- but really, consider the source. Both are established Christian writers. What did you think they would write about? Some sort of philosophy in which God doesn't really care about our ultimate fate? That seems to be the popular idea nowadays, but still not one everyone embraces. These authors are writing from their ideas and their life experiences, which surely are different from mine or yours. Additionally, if you are trying to compare this fictional work with the text of the Bible, this series will come up short every time -- it is FICTION for a reason! It is someone's idea of what COULD happen, not a definite foretelling of what will happen.I enjoyed this book because it is a fascinating look at what COULD happen at the end of time. How the \"Rapture\" will effect the global economy, politics, and families. How easily people can be deceived and killed with kindness. It makes the reader reflect on what he or she would do in that situation. It was a very easy read, and very entertaining. I will absolutely be reading the next in the series.Nicolae is the third book in the Left Behind series, and in my opinion, it is the best one so far. This book gets into some real character development, which seemed to be lacking in the previous two books. The characters are multi-dimensional and face real problems and need to make serious decisions, and seem to have deep emotions. Significant characters do pass on in this book, and as the reader I felt all of the emotions connected with the loss. Additionally, the suspense is definitely more engaging in this book, and I kept the pages turning and am looking forward to reading \"Soul Harvest.\""}, {"userName": "Alexander", "userReviewDate": "Jun 25, 2016", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/50854041-alexander", "userReview": "This is the third novel in the Left Behind series.

Concepts which are included erroneously in this book are centrifugal force, internal bleeding, flight ranges of specific aircraft, satellite dishes, truth serum, earthquakes / plate tectonics, and meteors / meteorites. Women are less disparaged in this book than in the past two, but only because they are almost completely inconsequential or stereotypical. The only women included are wives of main characters, a bitchy lesbian, a secretary, and a woman included in order to be able to preach the Christian standing on abortion.

The writing is so laughably lacking in any sort of creative realm it is almost painful to me. The use of metaphoric language is absolutely nonexistent in these novels. Basically, I read this book in a day. And while I am a fast reader, that is a feat I have rarely achieved. I am convinced I did it because they are so simple to read. Straightforward, no frills, just boom boom boom. But not exactly in a good way. While the pace is sometimes exciting, the author's frivolous use of flipping back and forth between stories is obnoxious at times and very unnecessary. I am not sure why this book was titled, \"Nicolae\" as very little of the book actually had to do with Carpathia. He was around...but the main story revolved around some sickeningly tidy and sugar sweet dual love stories about Buck/Chloe and Rayford and some obscure woman whom we are supposed to care about OUT OF THE BLUE! I am pretty disappointed in mostly the execution of this novel and not so much in the story. The final straw for me was the extremely obnoxious right wing preaching about abortion smack dab in the middle of the book. Uhm, random? To me it was a desperate attempt to throw down a religious agenda that had, up to this point, been coming along nicely with no \"in your face\" politics involved. Yuck. I'll keep reading because the story of the Rapture is captivating, I just wish someone else had this idea and did it better, because this series could have been absolutely astounding and breath taking, but it just isn't anything more than a little intriguing."}, {"userName": "Briana", "userReviewDate": "Dec 14, 2016", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/18913814-briana", "userReview": "This is the last book I read in this series a year or so ago.

Bombs are dropping where Chloe and Buck live in Chicago. Rayford is flying Nicolae Carpathia around to New Babylon, Iraq, and other exotic places, while spying on the man he\u2019s convinced will soon be revealed as the Antichrist. The story expands to include Ken Ritz, Mac McCullum, and Amanda White, and returns to a familiar character, Hattie Durham, to give her another shot at redemption.In Israel, biblical scholar Tsion Ben-Judah is hiding out from the men who murdered his family and wish to silence him. Buck attempts a daring rescue of Tsion, and they both become wanted men. Even natural disasters come into play. It\u2019s non-stop action from start to cliff-hanger finish.This episode of the series illustrated something that amazes me about Bible prophecy. \nThe story shows how so many will experience cataclysmic events, see all the norms of life change before their eyes, understand that in their humanness they can do nothing to help themselves, and yet turn to a human man to save them.\n While all the time God will continue to reach out to them through supernatural means and through the lives of Tribulation saints.\nI believe that whatever the Bible says will happen in the future is just as settled as what has already happened in the past. So the first time I read this series, I remember being so thankful that two authors, Tim LaHaye and Jerry Jenkins, had taken literally the Scripture I\u2019ve built my life upon and crafted a story from it.\n I felt that same thanks as I re-read each book. While other speculative fiction is fantasy, I know that the concept behind these books is based on truth.

The Left Behind series so far has been riveting to me and this book has been the best yet. The writing was not fantastic, at times, but the characters are relatable and easy to attach your heart to. Some parts in this action-packed book had me on the edge of my car seat as I listened, especially the end and also the part in the middle with the escape from Israel!! You watch certain characters wrestle with making the choice to turn to Christ and your heart wrenches as you hope they make that choice on time!! The story is great and is incredibly inspiring. Many people are overly critical of this series due to the fact that it is a fictional rendition of what is yet to come in the End Times, but I certainly am not one of those people. I love the opportunity it offers me to think about what that time may actually look like and to soften my heart to be ready to share my faith so that those I love can have an opportunity to avoid a time where an anti-christ who maybe will be like Nicolae Carpathia is in charge.

He also criticized the book for being written in \"slapdash\" manner in just 28 days, which in Clark's opinion betrays the Christian (Protestant) notion of the importance of treating one's craft being a vocation for God.

I guess it was simply the really poor writing skills of the author that ended up putting me off because reading even one sentence would make me cringe. Granted there are a lot of cringeworthy books out there, but I generally do not read them. It is not that I have anything against pure escapism, but even then the Left Behind series would hardly be called escapism: I would describe them more as being 'fear evangelism'.\tIn the previous book I spoke about pre-millenialism, and I has spoken about 'fear evangelism' elsewhere, so I think I might spend some time talking about amillenialism and post-millenialism (which does not get all that much press, unfortunately). The concept of amillenialism is that we are currently living in the millenium which began when Christ ascended into heaven and ends when Christ returns. The time of the return is unknown, meaning that it could happen tomorrow, or it could happen in another two thousand years. We simply do not know. While there is an essence of urgency, as I have indicated elsewhere, the fact that we could get hit by a tram while crossing Flinders Street and killed puts the whole idea of Christ's return in a new perspective: let us realise that while Christ can return at anytime, but we could also die at anytime, and as such, being caught with our metaphorical pants down is a concern that of which we need to be aware. Mind you, the metaphorical pants down could simply be us being oblivious to how we are offending God, even if we profess Jesus as Lord. Remember that James says that even the demons know that Jesus is lord, and tremble with fear.\tLet me outline something that Graeme Goldsworthy indicated in his book, The Gospel in Revelation, that I looked at previously. He speaks of the concept of us being washed clean and being given new clothes. This is an image that appears throughout the bible, but I did not fully understand it until I read Goldworthy's book. The idea of being given new clothes is another analogy of us being cleansed of our sins. However, there is a story of a wedding feast in Matthew where the host comes in to see a person dressed inappropriately, and as a result he is tossed out. This could be anyone of us, and because I did not fully understand the nature of this analogy, I would always worry about being this person (simply because I never seem to be able to know how to dress). However, the clothes are an analogy that represents how God views us. We all wear dirty clothes in God's eyes, but what Jesus has done, with his death, is that he has removed our old, soiled, clothes and put on new ones. However some of us, while paying lip service to God, have never actually had our clothes removed, so while we might go through life believing God owes us because of our self-righteousness, when we arrive at the wedding feast, the bouncer will say 'I'm sorry, there is a dress standard, and you are not dressed appropriately.' So, as Plato says through the mouth of Socrates, 'the unexamined life is not worth living', meaning, let us continue to examine our lives, and our relationship with God, so that that may not happen.\tNow, another aspect of amillenialism is the struggle between wanting Christ to return soon, and wanting time to be able to finish the work that we have been put here to perform. Now, when the proverbial shit hits the fan, and life simply sucks, we want Jesus to come and take us away, however, when I look at the piles of books that I want to read and comment on, and all of the people that I have not met, I desire for there to be a delay. I am not the only one in that boat because Paul the apostle was in that boat as well. I guess what we need to remember is that the days are short, and Christ can come at anytime, so let us take whatever opportunity arises to continue God's work.\tNow, post-millenialism is the idea that the millenium has passed as that we are in a new age awaiting God. However God will not return until a certain point has been reached, which involves bringing people into his kingdom. This is not much different from amillenialism, or even pre-millenialism, however the difference is the timing of the millenium, and this could be the period from 500 to 1500, which saw the rise and fall of the Catholic Church in Europe. This, I believe, is a bit problematic simply because it is very speculative. However, moving on we have entered a period of unprecidented evangelism and technological advancement, as well as a period where our understanding and reasoning has expanded. The wonderful thing about humanity is our ability to preserve knowledge and to teach others, particularly the younger generation. Thus, in a way, each successive generation becomes more knowledgeable than the preceding one.\tThis, in my opinion, is the crux of evolution. Humanity was degenerating right up until Christ's first appearance, and with that appearance, history turned 180 degrees and humanity began to evolve again. As history continued, our understanding grew, and our knowledge increased, and we have reached this point. Is this the end, I do not think so, because we still have not evolved out of our greedy and self-centred nature. However, as time moves on, and knowledge increases, we will continue to evolve to a point where we can evolve no further without further intervention from above, at which point Christ returns.\tWhile a wonderful idea I feel that it does fall down in a lot of places, namely because there is no one who is righteous, not even one. However, our understanding of human rights, and our desire to step in and help the poor, our overthrowing of corrupt governments, which are among many other aspects of our evolution, have moved us socially forward. Yet, it is also trying to pin point a date, which is something we cannot do. So, in the end, there are probably only two understandings of the millenium which I feel comfortable with, and that is the amillenialist view, and the pan-millenialist view, namely that it will all pan out in the end."}, {"userName": "Ryan", "userReviewDate": "Jan 28, 2018", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/10034315-ryan", "userReview": "The phases of the book of Revelation continue to play out as prophecied. The third installment of the Left Behind series takes focus on the continued rise of Nicolae Carpathia and the continued expansion of the Tribulation Force. This installment certainly does a better job of thickening the plot of the entire series with a chess match beginning to take form between Carpathia and the Tribulation Force (and the growing number of followers). However, differing from the first two, this book spends more time on regurgitating verses from the Bible than on actually advancing the plot. During the times where there was an advancement in the story, it definitely does a good job of keeping you going and wanting to see what happens next. Yet just as you think you have a hit a groove you get hoodwinked with 5 straight pages of proselytizing, which given the nature of the book series shouldn't come as a big surprise. It just deters from a growing plot and seems extremely forced and out of place in the grand scheme of the storyline. Overall, the storyline has definitely peaked my interest, but the forced Bible verses really undercuts the flow."}, {"userName": "Nicole", "userReviewDate": "May 17, 2018", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/1435391-nicole", "userReview": "I read what I did of this series because it was one of the few books my then-husband would read, and I wanted to be able to discuss books with him.

Meh. Meh. Lots of condescension and anti-intellectualism in this book as well, though I guess that's to be expected. Nothing of serious interest goes on, and Nicolae continues to be the most uninspiring and boring anti-Christ ever presented in book form. The Omen series was a good, somewhat schlocky set of movies dealing with the birth and rise of the anti-Christ. Sam Neill was an AWESOME son of the devil; charismatic, attractive, actually well spoken and wonderfully subtly evil. You could see him rising to power easily; could imagine people being captivated by him. Nicolae is nice looking and that's about it. Buck and Rayford continue to be generally self-involved jerks, though Buck sometimes deigns to lend a hand to someone outside of the elite \"Tribulation Force\" inner circle. Buck drives like an absolute asshole all over Chicago looking for Chloe, then seems to worry more about the state of their newly purchased car than his wife when finding her knocked over near some kind of embankment. Later on in the book, both he and Rayford try to talk Hattie into keeping her child, which happens to be the spawn of our charming anti-Chris Nicolae. They badger her relentlessly about doing the right thing, which equals not an abortion (and heavily leans toward keeping the baby), but Buck flat out thinks to himself that he wouldn't be up to raising the child of the anti-Chris. Nice, Buck. It's cool for you to think it's icky, but Hattie should just handle that shit like it's no big thing, right? I could go on, but it would just belabour the point. The authors of this book seem to misunderstand nuclear arms/bombs quite a bit. In the beginning of the book, World War 3 apparently breaks out and some militia's around the world coordinate attacks on major cities. The Global Community forces then retaliate with their own bombs. Despite using nukes, in many cases it's mentioned that they are several megatons, there is little to no fallout in the areas where the authors would like their kickin rad Tribulation saints to reside (namely Chicago, but pretty much a ton of other areas around the world that they want to scoot through). It's mentioned that Heathrow and the surrounding areas will have fallout for months or something ridiculous after being hit by a many megaton nuke. Seriously guys, do a little freaking research. With a 20 megaton nuke you have first degree burns as far out as 53km, so halve that for a 10 megaton nuke. That is some serious initial damage, and very serious long term effects. But Heathrow is up and running again about a year later (in future books) and no one seems to be suffering from those effects. Back to the Hattie abortion thing again. At one point, as Rayford is pretty much trying to guilt Hattie into keeping the child, he thinks to himself \"He had to remind himself that she was not a believer. She would not be thinking about the good of anyone but herself. Why should she?\" Seriously? SERIOUSLY? Because apparently only born again Christians can possibly think about doing anything at all ever for the good of others. Thus far in the book series, Rayford has helped to convert exactly one person, his daughter Chloe. He sometimes witnesses to co-pilots and the like, but he has very honestly never done any thing particularly nice and or charitable for anyone outside of his little core group of elitists. He knew about planned attacks on the bay area in California ahead of time yet warned exactly NO ONE about it, including the co-pilot who had just flown into the airport with him. He delayed the flight until his new wife got on board a connecting flight, making sure that she and only she was okay, then fucked off and left the lives of millions of innocents in God's hands. Awesome job, Rayford. You sure do exemplify caring about others to an inordinate degree there champ. This is par for the course in these books though, as unbelievers are always prideful or stupid or illogical or selfish or childish or any number of other things. I knew going in that things would be this way, but I can't help but get pissed off every time it happens. On another note, Ken Ritz is probably my favorite character so far. He has this folksy, down-to-earth quality that I really like, and he takes part in all of the actiony type sequences, which are frankly the best parts of any particular book in this series. I hope that he is still my favorite after he converts, which I'm sure is coming fairly soon.Oh, one other thing. No one in these books can cuss, obviously, because the books are written by two believers and I guess it's a thing with them. I'm aware of the not taking God's name in vain stuff, but I had no idea that there was anything else relating to cussing in the Bible. However, I digress. Because of this prohibition, everyone, even the blatantly EVIL characters in the book have to speak a certain way. When someone pisses them off, they can't just fly off the handle and call them assholes. Instead of this, they use the word \"rascal\". Repeatedly. Every character. I would think that words like \"jerk\" and/or \"punk\" and/or any number of other non-cusswords would work, but everyone and their brother uses \"rascal\". I feel like I'm stuck back in 1930's America reading this. I wish that they would use something even more blatant and flowery like \"rapscallion\", but no dice so far."}, {"userName": "Kelly", "userReviewDate": "Jul 13, 2017", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/39940658-kelly", "userReview": "Things keep getting crazier as the tribulation progresses, but God is still there helping His people through all of it."}, {"userName": "Kayla", "userReviewDate": "Mar 12, 2017", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/62447019-kayla", "userReview": "I liked several things about this third book in the series, although I did spend some time trying to make the little thing at the beginning (\"First they were LEFT BEHIND.

It would be easy to show a new scene that would set the whole feeling for the rest of the book without relying on your old book. Despite that, I actually think that I liked this book the best out of the first three that I've reread thus far. It's got more action and suspense in it. You can really feel the drama heating up as things start to happen. It has the feel that time is short and every single second and every decision really matters. That's quite appropriate for the subject matter of this book and I feel like it's starting to click together more and more. I do wish that there was a bit more variety in the characters, however. I don't feel like the other side is given as much of a showing. I don't mean the Global Community side but the skeptics side. I know there are some but it almost feels like it's a given that the characters they do focus on that aren't saved will become that way soon. Maybe I just like more variety in the characters.

This book also leaves me anticipating what will happen to the members of the Tribulation Force now that the Earth has been struck by the Wrath of the Lamb. Who has survived? Who didn't?I highly recommend this series. This is the third book and there are nine more to go and I am eagerly anticipating each one."}, {"userName": "Jessica", "userReviewDate": "Aug 05, 2009", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/314066-jessica", "userReview": "Although the book is called Nicolae, I really didn't learn much more about the anti-Christ than I had from reading the other 2 books. Pretty much the only storyline I was interested in (and that I hadn't heard in the other books)was that of Ben-Judah and his escape. I am over the cheesy conversations between Buck and Chloe, Ray and Chloe, or Ray and Amanda. Despite all this, I'll probably continue to read through the series because I really want to know what is supposedly in store for us."}, {"userName": "Carly", "userReviewDate": "Jul 24, 2007", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/164280-carly", "userReview": "I think this is the one where the Antichrist proves his evilness by embracing all religions & espousing a humanist philosophy. (Sounds like someone has an agenda here.) This is the last book I read in the series. It's pretty hilarious. Also, I believe a good portion of the book is little more than an advertisement for the Land Rover.
