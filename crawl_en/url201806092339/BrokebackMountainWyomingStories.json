I think this would have worked better in longer form, as it felt way too rushed. This was a very character driven story, but I feel like I didn't get to know the characters all that well. I'm excited to watch the movie tonight! updateSo I watched the movie, and it was a very good adaptation of the story! Many direct quotes from the story were used, and it followed the exact same plot but fleshed it out a lot more. Not the most exciting movie of all time, but I definitely felt the feels because Jake and Heath perfectly portrayed the leading men.

It was his own plaid shirt, lost, he\u2019d thought, long ago in some damn laundry, his dirty shirt, the pocket ripped, buttons missing, stolen by Jack and hidden here inside Jack\u2019s own shirt, the pair like two skins, one inside the other, two in one.\nSometimes, I want to cry.When I hear of cases of gay adolescents and adults who commit suicide because they are harassed, they feel alienated, like outcasts and have absolutely no more strength inside of them, all I want to do is curl up in a corner andcry, cry, crybecause it\u2019sunfair, unfair, unfair.But crying won't help.Everyone should have the right to love freely and be loved back without being pointed at and tyrannized for showing such a beautiful emotion.We live in an ugly world.But Jack and Ennis, they live in an uglier one.What if they hadn\u2019t met? Would my heart still be intact today? But that\u2019s impossible. Fate would have brought them together, if not at Brokeback Mountain, someplace else \u2013 some other time, some other day. They would still have felt that indescribable connection and denied their attraction to one another.Neither of them knows how to \u2018\u2018deal\u2019\u2019 with what\u2019s happening between them, but Jack is determined to get his happy ever after. He wants to settle down with Ennis and start their flawed live together. Ennis\u2026 Ennis is lost. He\u2019s afraid, mostly. When he was young, his father made sure he saw the body of the rancher who was tortured to death for being gay.He never forgot.Even a fully-grown man can be scared out of his mind and prefer giving up on the most beautiful life he could have with his loved one, for guaranteed security. Therefore, Jack and Ennis don\u2019t agree on the subject of moving in together. Especially now that Ennis has a wife and children \u2013 he can\u2019t leave them, so he says.As much as I wanted to shake Ennis, I understood his reasons for preferring to steer clear of anything that could make him end up like the dead rancher.Sometimes, love isn\u2019t enough.Sometimes, sacrifices have to be done to survive.What a cruel world.PS.

No, I am not homophobic (my older brother is gay); but I do get uncomfortable when reading about two men kissing. So, needless to say, I wasn't expecting much from this very short novella. Let me be the first to say how utterly wrong I was. This novella is not merely about two men who fall in love; it is about love itself. The love story these men share is intense, stormy, beautiful, and heart-wrenching, and I found myself thankful that I have only ever loved one woman my entire life--I duped her into marrying me later--and, therefore, have never had my heart broken. Put away your preconceived ideas and give this story a chance. If anything, it will only take you a few hours to read. But if you like it, I am sure you will leave this story with a greater insight to what it means to be in love with someone.

Her novel The Shipping News won the Pulitzer Prize, and her latest novel Barkskins seems to have been written in the same vain. As I am drawn to Pulitzer winners in my ongoing personal challenge to read them, I decided to sample Proulx's writing before undergoing the reading of one of her full length novels. Brokeback Mountain set high in the Rockies and later made into a movie of the same name was originally published in the New Yorker. A controversial story of forbidden love, the writing did not disappoint.Ennis Del Mar and Jack Twist were both twenty and looking to embark on their ranching careers. Each came from a distinct background from opposite ends of the state of Wyoming yet wound up on the same summer sheep drive up on Brokeback Mountain near the Montana border. Both young men were classic macho cowboys who could hold his own on the range. Ennis was engaged to be married to a local sweetheart the following December. Yet, one cold night while sharing a sleeping bag, the two men engaged in a forbidden act of love that is all but taboo in the cowboy community. This one event commenced Jack and Ennis' relationship for the next twenty years, one that would hold disastrous for them and their families.At only fifty five pages in length, Proulx weaved a tragic story of forbidden love. It is a subject matter that I often stay away from yet the writing was so compelling that I read the entire story in mere minutes. Proulx is originally from the eastern United States, but her prose describing rural Wyoming is captivating, and one could see how from this short story, that the scenery could easily transfer to the big screen. It is because of the writing that I stuck with the story. I felt for Ennis' wife who had to hide her husband's secret for years, working to support their two daughters while he pined for Jack. Proulx set the story up so that the majority of readers would sympathize with the cowboys, but I was lead to feel for the supporting cast of characters who were all effected by these two men's decision of continuing a forbidden, clandestine, taboo relationship. Not only were the characters well fleshed out, but Proulx weaved in multiple story lines in this short tale, making the writing engaging from start to finish.After reading the tragic Brokeback Mountain, I am left uncertain whether I will read Proulx's Pulitzer winning novel. I have heard that her full length books are slow moving albeit attentive to detail and emphasizing character development rather than plot. It is obvious that from this short tale that Proulx can write and I am intrigued to fit her novels into my ongoing Pulitzer challenge. For now, I am left with a bittersweet taste in my mouth after engaging in this short story.4.5 stars writing2.75 stars story"}, {"userName": "Nancy", "userReviewDate": "Dec 02, 2008", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/763271-nancy", "userReview": "I picked this up at the library last night because it was a tiny book, perfect for today's lunch time read.I'm ashamed to say that I attempted to watch the film, but fell asleep about 45 minutes in.

Gay was not a word I heard, unless someone in my class was teasing someone or something. I grew up in the Irish countryside so I was quite sheltered until I was at least 15/16 (hmm, same year we got Wi-Fi). But as a 12 year old, to be \"gay\" meant something bad and dirty and I never understood why. Nobody could give me an acceptable answer as to why it was wrong but I was afraid to question things so I just went with it. When I watched this, I remember that seed of doubt that was already there in my mind being watered a bit. The two cowboys really loved each other, in their own way and I could see nothing wrong with it. Looking back, this film was the first thing to really open my eyes to what it was like to be gay. I've been meaning to read the book for a while now and it definitely lived up to my expectations. It is so short but it packs so many emotions into it; it really is incredible. I'm always impressed when an author can pack so much into a short story without hindering any other element. This story is beautiful, tragic, heart-breaking and heart-warming. It makes you wish that things were different for Ennis & Jack. I really enjoyed it and I would love to read more stories like this one.I was unsure about the writing style at the start but when I got into it, I really liked it.

I didn't need my heart anyway. This book is like a punch in the gut. I never thought that a short story could have such an impact on me. This isn\u2019t simply a book about two cowboys falling in love: this is the heartbreaking tale of Jack and Ennis who love each other, but deny it not only because they\u2019re afraid of the outside world, but also of their own feelings. America in the 1960\u2019s wasn\u2019t a safe place for homosexuals after all, and if society can\u2019t accept them, how can they accept themselves? That emotional struggle makes this book so heart-wrenching, because both men know their love for each other is real. It just can\u2019t happen. And that tears them apart.  [Jack:] \u201cYou have no fuckin idea how bad it gets. I\u2019m not you. I can\u2019t make it on a couple a high-altitude fucks once or twice a year. You\u2019re too much for Ennis, you son of a whoreson bitch. I wish I knew how to quit you.\u201d Maybe this story hits so much harder because the books I read earlier featured happy LGBT-characters. Where young transgender Stella gets the full support of her mother (The Sunlight Pilgrims) and Simon\u2019s coming out is met with positive reactions (Simon Vs. the Homo Sapiens Agenda), Jack and Ennis\u2019s (love) life is anything but happy and easy. They were two masculine men living in prejudice Wyoming during the sixties, a place where young Ennis saw an old rancher being tortured to death for being gay. This was not uncommon back then, and times haven\u2019t really changed for the better.Because although the world is slowly getting more accepting of gay love, still so many LGBT-people are getting harassed, kicked out, or physically and/or emotionally abused because of who they love. Don\u2019t get blinded by the Pride Parades or the legalisation of same-sex marriage in America: the world is still a cruel place for many. This is why I think Brokeback Mountain is a must read for fans of LGBT-books, to get that reality check. To other readers I\u2019d also recommend this book, because for a book with only 60 pages, this short story packs a powerful punch. The prose is concise and the writing style rough, but it suits the characters and their story. 5 stars for this heart-breaking little book, which I won\u2019t forget soon."}, {"userName": "Cecily", "userReviewDate": "Jan 17, 2014", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/1199525-cecily", "userReview": "I read this in the collection Close Range: Brokeback Mountain and Other stories, which I reviewed HERE.I knew this exquisite story well from the film, and the two are very similar.

In the interim, \"What J remembered and craved in a way he could neither help nor understand was... the silent embrace satisfying some shared and sexless hunger.\"It happens to concern homosexual love between cowboys, starting in the 1960s, but it could just as easily be any taboo relationship.The harsh beauty of the mountains, coupled with love and longing, reminded me a little of Cold Mountain, which I reviewed HERE."}, {"userName": "Sidharth Vardhan", "userReviewDate": "Feb 10, 2017", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/58296635-sidharth-vardhan", "userReview": "More of a novella than a short story.

This work has been termed apolitical by some, but seriously, how can you call a history of human sacrifice apolitical? Not even dwelling on the money, status, and human network so often illegally amputated and afterwards legally maintained, but you should really be looking at where one may be fired, alienated, and killed for same sex marriage. Here is a good start. So long as all that exists, the tire iron is still in force. I'm not even going to talk about countries outside the US, both for reasons of US-centricity and, really, if the biggest imperial force of contemporary times starts putting socioeconomic pressure on the source of those homophobic delegations fucking around on their passports, some good may come of it.The book? Well, for a tip of the iceberg, it doesn't mince around the brutality of living a love that historically and presently is deemed obscene, perverse, unnatural, absurd, corrupting, and above all, other. We're talking a difference of sexuality, indeed only the most popular of many myriads, that the US used in the late 20th century as an excuse for ignoring a pandemic within the boundaries of home territory. The book is wary, self-sufficient, sweet (mind, I wouldn't recommend using it as a guide to safe sex of the sort it contains), and knows that particular future of blood and vice and quarantine is to be expected. One review says, of the two main characters, that \"[t]hey know what they're not\u2014not queer, not gay\u2014but they have no idea what they are\"; to be labeled with the popularly ostracized is to commit to death.In regards to same sex marriage? I'd like to think that bans lifted in conjunction with legal marital rights (hospital visits, name on the death certificate, adoption) will expand the reality beyond the sensationalized stereotypes and into the mundane of missed deadlines, exasperating paperwork, and side characters in a novel who, thanks to the author's experiences in a broader space of public personal interaction, will be enhanced with real flesh and blood. The problem, you see, is this is all very mental, philosophical, the sort of social structuring that really doesn't mean much to those who are still dying. The problem is whether this story of Brokeback Mountain will have to be told again, and again, and again, as the public refuses to take LGBT in more than a single wave of dosage, that category here, this category there, never mind the intersections of gender, race, religion, others upon others whose denizens will be impacted regardless of the awareness of common sense.I don't know. I really don't. I'll keep reading, though.

Brokeback Mountain is emotional, resonant, and ultimately gut-wrenching--and quietly so. This is a humble story, tightly focused almost exclusively on young Wyoming cowboys Ennis and Jack as they spend a summer working together on Brokeback Mountain. Before long they\u2019re forced to reconcile their love for each other with their everyday, conventional, socially acceptable lives. What\u2019s most powerful about Brokeback Mountain is the frightening reality facing these two, that they would be in danger if together, not just frowned upon and harassed:Jack, I don\u2019t want a be like them guys you see around sometimes. And I don\u2019t want a be dead. There was these two old guys ranched together down home, Earl and Rich--Dad would pass a remark when he seen them. They was a joke even though they was pretty tough old birds. I was what, nine years old and they found Earl dead in a irrigation ditch. They\u2019d took a tire iron to him, spurred him up, drug him around by his dick until it pulled off, just bloody pulp. What the tire iron done looked like pieces a burned tomatoes all over him, nose tore down from skiddin on gravel.Proulx bravely addressed a taboo topic head-on but refrained from pushing an agenda or manipulating emotions. Brokeback Mountain is a story she constructed around a reality; there\u2019s a sincerity to what happens in these pages. A surprise toward the end takes the story in a direction the reader won\u2019t predict, and it\u2019s perfect, true to the overall serious, introspective tone but also reinforcing Proulx\u2019s message well.Final verdict: A superb short story, beautiful in its way, heavily character driven, atmospheric, and most of all, moving."}, {"userName": "JaHy\u261dHold the Fairy Dust", "userReviewDate": "Apr 28, 2015", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/17750574-jahy-hold-the-fairy-dust", "userReview": "This novel is surprisingly short . . . which makes it difficult to rate the book unbiasedly :-/ I found myself replaying the (exceptional) movie in my mind the entire time. . . . . . . . . . .

I've never seen the movie either. (Though I might now. I'm curious how they handled it.) Stories about ranchers & cowboys don't exactly draw me in. To be honest, Annie Proulx's stories don't have much appeal to me in general. I can't really put my finger on it, but they just don't scream \"Read me!\" when I see one. Anyway, I had to go to the library to stop them from billing me for a book I'd already returned, and while I was there, I happened to see this book, and thought, \"What the hell? It's short.\" So I grabbed it. And it was worth it. This is a very short story, but it works at this length. It fits this length. It's sparse and visceral. I was surprised that on page 14, in the space of a single sentence, the relationship between Ennis and Jack goes from co-workers to lovers. It was less like a bomb dropping than like a rock smashing through a window. There's no warning, no whistling descent to warn of the impending explosion - it's just not there one second, and then it is, and there's nothing to do but deal with it. On an emotional level, I feel for these guys. They were both dishonest with themselves for a long time, and neither of them could have the relationship they needed. Jack needed that companionship and understanding and acceptance - and he couldn't get it unconditionally from Ennis. It actually breaks my heart a little bit, because Ennis was more afraid of the \"what if\" than he was OK with the \"what is\", and they both suffered for it. Ennis lost his chance at happiness that he didn't even know he needed until it was too late. The scene at Jack's parents' house was rough, because I can imagine Ennis understanding the depth of Jack's feelings for the first time, maybe, and being unable to change how things turned out would have to be hard. Thinking about that kind of regret kind of kills me a little inside... I'm surprised how much I liked this book. I really didn't expect to like it nearly as much as I did, but a good tear-jerker will do it for me every time. I love when a book can transcend boundaries and make me really identify with a character (or characters) and make me hurt for them. I'll definitely have to check out more of Proulx's books.

Wow, just wow. The movie was beautifully shot, with strong performance from Heath Ledger as Ennis del Mar and Jake Gyllenhaal as Jack Twist. The breathtaking scenery of Wyoming, especially of Brokeback Mountain, and those chubby, cutie sheep add so much poetry to a truthful but forbidden love story.I must admit, when I read the story, I really didn\u2019t know how director Ang Lee could transform 55 pages of words into an Oscar-nominated 2-hour-long movie that brought tears to my eyes. But after watching the movie, I kinda knew how he did it. What Annie Proulx described in her short story in one sentence, Ang Lee let it play out in multiple different scenes, permitting viewers to experience the story of \u201cBrokeback Mountain\u201d in a deeper and more complete way. He also added some new side characters (I believe) to the movie version, which in turn gave the story more dynamics and colors. Heath Ledger, with his sad eyes, brilliantly portrayed Ennis del Mar - an introverted, silent cowboy who had to choose between his responsibility as a husband and father, and the dream of being with Jack Twist in their own paradise. Jake Gyllenhaal also brought Jack Twist to life - a seemingly straight man who leaned more toward gay in the sexuality spectrum. Both actors and the script really highlighted the struggle that gay men at that time must have faced, not only repressed sexuality but also the ties and bonds in their realities that prevented them from living their love and the life that they wanted. So much happened in both Ennis and Jack\u2019s lives; so much passed between them, and they lost 20 years in which they could have been together during that process. All that was left was Brokeback Mountain, the memories of those days they spent together when they were young, which were represented in the two shirts and a photo of the mountain, hiding inside Ennis\u2019 closet. I cried when Ennis cried; my heart broke for him, for Jack Twist, for the love that must forever be kept silent\u2026 How sad and how depressing. I just wish both Ennis and Jack had been born in this time, when there has been so much improvement and openness on how the society views the LGBTQ community.

The best summary about this beautifully written short story belongs to Walter Kirn\u2019s review in New York Magazine:\n\u201cA stand-out story\u2026 \u2018Brokeback Mountain\u2019 is the sad chronology of a love affair between two men who can\u2019t afford to call it that. They know what they\u2019re not - not queer, not gay - but have no idea what they are.\u201d\nYes, both Ennis and Jack refused to identify themselves as gay or queer. Ennis even said he loved having sex with women. Both got married, had kids, but somehow the bond that formed during those nights spent together on Brokeback Mountain still haunted them ever since. Ennis missed Jack so much; Jack wanted to have more chances, more time, more love makings with Ennis rather than just one or two copulations in four years. They were trapped in an unsung love and the fear of being repudiated, even tortured, by the society, at that time still didn\u2019t accept that men could fall in love with men, too. Were Ennis and Jack gay, or were they bisexual? Does this question even matter, when, in my opinion, this story isn\u2019t just about repressed sexuality? It\u2019s simply about love between two human beings, which transcends sexual orientation, labels or what we come to define as LGBTQ.And don\u2019t let me start talking about the ending, which nearly broke my heart and brought tears to my eyes:\n\"The shirt seemed heavy until he saw there was another shirt inside it, the sleeves carefully worked down inside Jack\u2019s sleeves. It was his own plaid shirt, lost, he\u2019d thought, long ago in some damn laundry, his dirty shirt, the pocket ripped, buttons missing, stolen by Jack and hidden here inside Jack\u2019s own shirt, the pair like two skins, one inside the other, two in one. He pressed his face into the fabric and breathed in slowly through his mouth and nose, hoping for the faintest smoke and mountain sage and salty sweet stink of Jack but there was no real scent, only the memory of it, the imagined power of Brokeback Mountain of which nothing was left but what he held in his hands.\u201d\nThe only thing I didn\u2019t like about this story is that it was too short, which means there wasn\u2019t enough space for character development. There were many parts in which I felt the change in the characters\u2019 attitude, feelings or thoughts were too abrupt. Even the progression of Ennis and Jack\u2019s love story felt a little bit rushed. With an amazing idea like this, I would love to see it be made into a novel, and I don\u2019t mind reading more pages and more words if it means I could experience the story in a deeper and more thorough way.How director Ang Lee took this 55-page short story and turned it into an Oscar-nominated 2-hour-long movie is beyond me :D I must watch the movie as soon as possible ahhhh!!!!

What can I say, I didn't like it. (I have seen the movie and didn't like that either.) This is the story of two young men in the west in the sixties who have a love affair while tending sheep one summer. This affair continues for many years, until one of the characters is brutally killed. According to one of the blurbs on the back of the book Brokeback Mountain \"Abolishes the Old West cliches\". Perhaps, but it does nothing to abolish the tired old gay cliches. When Ann Bannon wrote the Beebo Brinker chronicles in the late fifties there was one simple rule for gay literature, no matter what good things happen during the book it's got to end badly. Beebo Brinker, Jiovanni's Room, The Well of loneliness...Do we really need another story about how it sucks to be gay and it will, of course, end badly? I also couldn't ultimately buy into the whole relationship. It seems to happen so fast and with so little discussion. I would never in a million years let some guy screw me when he won't talk about what's going on, or for that matter, look me in the face. As a result I can't put myself into either character's shoes or accept them as anything other than fictional. The third and final thing I didn't like has to do with the fact that Annie Proulx is a straight woman. It's not that straight writers can't write gay characters, or for that matter that gay writers can't write straight characters. It's just that she has received so many accolades for this story pisses me off. The movie, directed by a straight man and people with mostly straight cast members, pisses me off even more. This is a story told by straight people about how they perceive the LGBT community. Then they want to pat themselves on the back about what a great thing they've done for us. All the while they are ignoring some many great LGBT authors who are writing and painting a much more diverse, vibrant and accurate picture of what our lives are really like."}, {"userName": "Anushree", "userReviewDate": "Jul 27, 2017", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/42789261-anushree", "userReview": "4.5 - Short reviewA little book of about 30 pages that covers a lifetime - Annie Proulx has a way with words with her compact, precise, to the point sentences. This story of Ennis and Jack, two cowboys, who fall in love, is gut-wrenching and a sure punch in the face to all the homophobes and society in general. Annie has managed to give out the exact emotions, without going overboard with the scenes. The dilemma that these lovers face, hasn't changed a bit since the story was written in 1997. We still live in a world where anything contrary to the normal parameters of sexuality is looked down upon and mocked and incarcerated or beaten the shit out of. Coming back to the story, I am still amazed at the fact that Proulx has managed such a depth, not once losing the flow of the characters. There are year jumps which have been handled with such clarity that never once did the transitioning feel odd. Most writers do such a thing by changing chapters or giving breaks, so that the reader knows it. Doing that in one flow, I think is a brilliant achievement. I sure am going to look forward to know more works of the author. If you have suggestions of some other works of the author or some other similar stories, do feel free to recommend?"}, {"userName": "Vivian", "userReviewDate": "Mar 02, 2014", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/3947172-vivian", "userReview": "Awww\u2026.Hell.

Es po\u00e9tico y muy espec\u00edfico al mismo tiempo. Todo en esta historia corta ocurre r\u00e1pido, como el paso de los a\u00f1os. Eso sin embargo no nos va a impedir sufrir. Est\u00e1n avisados.Esta es la historia de Jack Twist y Ennis del Mar, dos cowboys pastores de ovejas (\u00bfo sheepboys?) que se conocen por accidente gracias a un trabajo en Brokeback Mountain. Entre ellos surge una atracci\u00f3n que los toma por sorpresa, y supongo que tambi\u00e9n al lector si no sabe de qu\u00e9 trata el libro (o la pel\u00edcula). Ambos son hombres recios, de pocas palabras y pocos sentimientos, y viven en un pueblo donde una relaci\u00f3n homosexual podr\u00eda costarles la vida.A pesar de que entre ellos surge un v\u00ednculo absoluto, no van a exteriorizar jam\u00e1s lo que sienten. Aunque al terminar el trabajo en Brokeback Mountain cada uno vuelve a su vida, con el paso de los a\u00f1os seguir\u00e1n encontrando la forma de verse de forma espor\u00e1dica (y clandestina) pero intensa.Durante una gran parte de la historia no termin\u00e9 de congeniar ni con Jack ni con Ennis, quiz\u00e1s en gran parte por lo hura\u00f1os que son tanto entre ellos como con la vida en general, o por esa forma de expresarse tan peculiar que demuestra la ausencia de educaci\u00f3n de ambos. El contraste entre la narraci\u00f3n y los di\u00e1logos es marcad\u00edsimo (y por momentos dificil de entender... al menos en ingl\u00e9s).Tiempo despu\u00e9s ese abrazo adormilado se consolid\u00f3 en su memoria como el \u00fanico momento de ingenua, encantadora felicidad en sus duras vidas separadas. Cerca del final, sin embargo, ocurre algo que me hizo cambiar de opini\u00f3n de forma abrupta. Me qued\u00e9 maravillada por el modo en que Annie Proulx manipul\u00f3 mis sentimientos, haci\u00e9ndome encari\u00f1ar en tres segundos con dos personajes que me resultaban relativamente indiferentes. Es una historia muy bella realmente, me alegro de haberla le\u00eddo.Rese\u00f1a de Fantas\u00eda M\u00e1gica"}, {"userName": "Serena Yates", "userReviewDate": "Jul 05, 2010", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/2798257-serena-yates", "userReview": "This book was chosen for me in the 'pick it for me challenge' in the m/m romance group here on goodreads.
