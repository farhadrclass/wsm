At turns searing, sensual, provocative, tragic, and evocative, Smith's collection is a potent commentary on race, sexuality, violence, prejudice, promiscuity, homophobia, AIDS, and death. Some of the poems absolutely took my breath away, and some painted immensely vivid pictures in my mind.i know when the wind feelsas if it's made of hands& i feel like i'm made of waterit's you trying to save mefrom drowning in myself, but i can'twed wind. i'm not water.The above stanzas are from \"summer, somewhere,\" an epic poem of sorts, which envisions an afterlife for young black men killed by police. It is emotional, anger-inducing, and tremendously thought-provoking, and Smith's language conveys both the peace and security this new world provides, while at the same time recognizing the tragedies that brought those to this place.here, there's no languagefor officer or law, no color to call white.if snow fell, it'd fall black. please, don't callus dead, call us alive someplace better.we say our own names when we pray.we go out for sweets & come back.Other poems deal with men struggling to fight their sexuality, yet succumbing to promiscuity, to risky sex and furtive hookups that they know could doom them. The poem \"bare,\" deals with taking that risk.if love is a roomof broken glass, leave me to danceuntil my feet are memory.Smith's words are sometimes brutal, sometimes explicitly sexual, sometimes painful. This may not be a collection for everyone, but it should be, because it helped me think about the families left behind when their children are lost to violence, the men raised to be masculine but who struggle with embracing the reality of who they are, how those diagnosed with HIV and AIDS struggle with their mortality.Not every poem worked for me, but those that did left me mesmerized. Smith is an absolutely incredible writer, and I'll definitely pick up another of his collections. This is poetry that may make you uncomfortable, but it dazzles at the same time.See all of my reviews at itseithersadnessoreuphoria.blogspot.com, or check out my list of the best books I read in 2017 at https://itseithersadnessoreuphoria.blogspot.com/2018/01/the-best-books-i-read-in-2017.html."}, {"userName": "Michael", "userReviewDate": "May 19, 2018", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/32804270-michael", "userReview": "Beginning with an extended meditation on the traumatic effects of police brutality in America, Don\u2019t Call Us Dead consists mostly of short poems that address the emotional toll of racism and homophobia upon the lives of queer Black men.

Some are about the great losses we have suffered every time an innocent black child or adult is killed. But the poems I found the most compelling were those where Danez writes about what is true now - the blood, the body, living through it.To that end, a note on the body is my favorite poem of the collection, despite it not being the most popular or most performed.

The poems in \u201cDon't Call Us Dead\u201d by Danez Smith have the urgent force of a rallying cry. They pay tribute to individuals and groups who will not be silenced no matter how much they are oppressed, incarcerated or killed. Specifically Smith speaks powerfully about the experience of being a gay African American: how skin colour can lead someone to be targeted by the police or alternately excluded/fetishised in the gay community. These are poems drawn from somewhere very personal. They sometimes play off from lyrics from musicians like Billie Holiday or Diana Ross and use a unique variety of forms to convey meaning as much in their structure as they do in the choice of words. Like all great poetry it can be interpreted a number of different ways, but there is a clarity of self here which definitely has something to say.Read my full review of Don't Call Us Dead by Danez Smith on LonesomeReader"}, {"userName": "Rod-Kelly Hines", "userReviewDate": "Oct 10, 2017", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/43107057-rod-kelly-hines", "userReview": "Danez Smith of the most brilliant poets writing today!

Prose will kill you. Let me correct that: Good prose will kill you. Great prose will leave you bereft. Or the other way around, but once poetry gets into your veins, you are an addict my friend! There is no way out of it. I was introduced to Neruda. Never say never also might work brilliantly as an adage. Circa 2018. I love poetry. I love poems that seize my heart and wring it with ease. Sometimes brutally. I failed to keep my promise. Why am I saying all this? Well, because I have just finished reading a brilliant book of poems and I want to let you know how I feel about it. The book in question: \u201cDon\u2019t Call Us Dead\u201d by Danez Smith. This collection isn\u2019t an easy one to read. If you are planning to read it at a stretch or even in one-sitting, my recommendation is you don\u2019t. Smith doesn\u2019t make poetry floral or sweet-smelling or even bearable for that matter. When it comes to me, I agree with him. Poetry like most form of art only reflects what exists around us and should with very good reason. \u201c...paradise is a world where everythingis a sanctuary & nothing is a gun...\u201d Just by reading these two lines, I was moved like I haven\u2019t been moved in a while. The idea that every place is sanctuary (so remote, isn\u2019t it?) and that nothing is a gun couldn\u2019t have rung truer than it does now. The now that we live in that Danez writes about so and that hits so hard. Smith\u2019s voice is much needed for everyone, but more so for the black men, for the young black man, the gay man, the kind who have endured a history of oppression and violence or have heard of it. It is for everyone who wants to change the world by reading and understanding and that empathy shines through Danez\u2019s poems. The beauty in all of them is striking, almost heartbreaking even. Take this one for example, where the loneliness of the gay man is stark and evident, universal that it strikes a chord one way or the other. \u201ceveryone on the app says they hate the app but no one stops I sit on the train, eyeing men, begging myself to talk to themHe whispers his name into my lower mouth I sing a song about being alone\u201d Danez Smith does not shy away from expressing. Some poems run into pages and lots of pages (and for good reasons) while others are explained briefly and they are as effective as any other poem in the collection. This isn\u2019t micro-poetry. This isn\u2019t slam poetry. It is life, that seeps, bleeds ad yearns through the veins and the pores. \u201cDon\u2019t Call Us Dead\u201d is set in a time \u2013 our time, which is equal parts scary, liberating and melancholic.

I have for years and there are several writers whom I have always enjoyed, like the standard: Robert Frost. My teenage daughter has turned me on to a few newer and contemporary writers of poetry like Rupi Kaur. Really good stuff. One of my favorites was The Rose That Grew From Concrete, by Tupac. For some reason it just hit me the right way.Enter Danez Smith.I was loaned this book which is a small book of poetry. I knew nothing about him and had never heard of him, to be honest. I spent the last few days reading, and even re-reading some of these works in this book. Now I may hear flack from this because of the things upcoming here. I ain't black, and I ain't gay. I ain't much knowledgeable of alternate lifestyles, and such. I know this: I am accepting and patient and open to reading anyone's viewpoint. I don't bias, nor do I judge. I read to enjoy stories, or to make me think. I'm an over-50 white dude, beardy and covered in tattoos.I love this book!Smith is angry and understanding and untouchable and immutable. He has passion and strength in who he is and the words he wants to put on paper. These poems are adult oriented and are stark and beautiful, harsh and real. He speaks for black people, for those who live alternate lifestyles. He tells a story and asks questions about why America does what it does to who it does it to. He rails about the deft knife that nicks the skin, while the cleaver follows, unseen. This....was....GREAT!It ain't for everybody and if someone had told me what I was about to read before I read it, I would have probably not enjoyed it as much. Danez Smith is an in-your-face dude, it feels like, but not in a bad way. In an \"open your eyes and look at me, look at us, look at the world around you\", way. Is he a prima donna? It doesn't feel like it. It feels like the words he has inside have got to come out, in one way or another.

I've never read poems that have made me so enraged with validation about ~everything~ about the world, that I've wanted to assault tens of people at 30,000 feet.The poems are absolutely gorgeous. There's not much point in me, someone who cannot write poems nearly this good, expounding upon what makes each of these so powerful. It would be better to simply read for yourself. But do contemplate this: you ever had a really good ass-whooping before? I don't even necessarily mean literally (though that works too) but the kind of domination that might occur on a basketball court or a game of Scrabble even. If you have experienced being shellacked by someone so far above you in terms of talent, you will be able to relate to how this book of poems makes you feel. Because for just under 100 pages, Smith repeatedly and beautifully smacks you upside the head with verse that is as musical as it can be dismal. It is Black, Black, Black in a way that deftly handles police shootings, sexual violence, interpersonal racism without equating suffering to the totality of the/a Black identity. And just like on the court or, apparently in a lopsided word game, if the person is good enough, you're *thankful* that they took the time out of their day to drag you up and down the floor. That's what this book is. It is (pleasantly) exhausting, and at times you will weep as you mourn Black folks you'll never meet. And at the end, once you've been run ragged by Smith's precise language and biting critique, you'll give thanks, turn back to the start of the book, and graciously ask that your hand be held as they rain truth upon truth on your head, jogging back upcourt laughing as you wonder how someone just as human as you could ever create something so transcendently beautiful."}, {"userName": "Shaun", "userReviewDate": "Jan 03, 2018", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/2621599-shaun", "userReview": "Not bad but not great either.
