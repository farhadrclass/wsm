However, I was surprised by how much I enjoyed it and how applicable it is not only to your professional life, but to all relationships and interactions with anyone you may encounter. The premise of this book is that in all interactions, we are either filling up someone's bucket or dipping from it. In other words, you can build someone up through positive interactions, or reduce them through negative ones. I was astounded by the wealth of information to back up this theory of the importance of positivity. Children do better in school with praise, businesses increase productivity, lives are lengthened through optimism, and marriages are strengthened through this approach. I really appreciated the frequent references to studies that backed up and illustrated how critical this idea is and how damaging constant negativity and criticism can be. For example, companies would be better off paying negative employees to stay at home because of the effect that their poor outlook has on productivity and morale across this board. This book urges readers to focus on praise, not criticism, and carefully consider how your interactions with others may be impacting them. Rather than focusing on what is wrong, focus on what is right and recognize the people responsible.While this book certainly made me think and made me want to improve on how often I recognize others through simple things like an email or a kind comment, I'm frustrated by it in the same way I am all books in its category. Unfortunately, you will only get out of this book what you want to get out of it. In other words, those that want to be better people, better employees, wives, friends, neighbors, citizens of the world, will benefit from this book. But its the people who are negative and critical who probably won't really try to change their ways, or who won't even bother to read this book or to read it with an open mind. However, I do think this book's advice is true - you don't know what changing your own behavior and what impact extending positivity to others may have. I'd like to think that, while it can't fix everybody's bad attitude, it may improve someone's. On another note, I could see how some people would find this book as overly simplified and common sense type advice, and it is, but unfortunately not advice that everyone follows and thus worth repeating.This was a really quick, light read with a simple premise and metaphor that can have a big impact. I really want to try to incorporate its lessons into my daily life. While these are lessons most people know, its good to have a reminder, and scientific back up, of just how critical it is to be kind to others."}, {"userName": "Melinda", "userReviewDate": "Nov 14, 2011", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/3350535-melinda", "userReview": "Is a review that isn't completely upbeat dipping from the author's bucket? I like the basic premise of this book. On an individual level, I agree with the authors. There are some serious energy-suckers/bucket dippers in the world. I plan to do my best to minimize my bucket dipping. I also really enjoyed thinking about the ways one likes to be acknowledged and appreciated. I have to tell my boss in a few weeks how I like to be acknowledged and this book gave me perspective on what I like. Also the emphasis on sincerity and an individualized approach appropriate to each person was a nice change from what one usually hears about employee appreciation. But this book left me with so many questions. How can you keep your bucket full when you live in a racist, capitalist, sexist, ableist, classist, generally oppressive society and you are one of the oppressed? What happens when the institutions of a society are set up to empty your bucket and then blame you for it? I know, I know institutions are made up of people who codify oppressions into society which manifests as institutionalized dipping? Maybe I'm thinking to deeply about this but those were my reflections."}, {"userName": "Donna", "userReviewDate": "Sep 26, 2014", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/13244359-donna", "userReview": "My friend said she thought this book was a cheesy way to get people to remember what they learned from their mamas. But I didn't get that vibe at all when I was reading it. If anything it kind of read like a parable. Things are remembered when they are related to something else that is a familiar concept. The whole bucket and dipper thing was just a tool in making the point and to help it linger longer in case it didn't completely stick.There are many practical applications of the main message of this book, which is to fill the buckets of others, and not just with business relationships, but also with personal ones as well. I am tempted to go buy a few copies and leave them anonymously on some peoples porches.

While the \"bucket\" concept is a little bit cheesy, I get the overall point...and it's a good one. We should try to project positivity toward others, thus increasing our own positivity.

Similarly, why is so society criticism-focused if it doesn't work? When are negative criticisms warranted and useful in a leaders toolbox? Also, as other reviewers have mentioned, how other than \"ignoring\" (author's words) constantly negatively-minded people can we mend dire environments/situations?Perhaps presenting this practical theory of bucket-filling in a historical and social context would bog down a self-help book of this nature, but resources to follow up on this ourselves would have been much obliged and allowed for a more holistic view of the problem.All in all, whether you thought this book was common sense or pure nonsense, an actionable game plan to include more positivity in your life can never be a bad idea. The science and powerful relevant anecdotes are just a (positively received!) extra."}, {"userName": "Loy Machedo", "userReviewDate": "Dec 05, 2011", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/7118702-loy-machedo", "userReview": "One hundred and twenty eight pages.Almost every alternate page of a quote with a picture of a bucket.It is then your spidey senses begin to tingle.May be this is one of those books that comes out with few words, a lot of wasted space and points of wisdom which are either too philosophical or outright idiotic.The question is on which side does it gravitate towards more?The good or evil?How FULL is Your Bucket? written by Tom Rath and Donald Clifton is a pathetic potpourri of parochial Panglossian prose with the poetic beliefs of Norman Vincent Peale, Dale Carneige and Dr. Wayne Dryer sandwiched in between American facts, moronic statistics and philanthropic shenanigansHe begins by citing examples of the American POW\u2019s and how they were emotionally dead thanks to the new found innovative mind games in North Korea.Then he moves to his own incredible life story of the author himself and how he overcame insurmountable odds (which was the only decent bit I found in the whole book \u2013 and yes, the part of being nice to children)After that it is nothing but American statistics, American problems and American blah blah.For instance65% of Americans reported receiving no recognition for good work in the past year\u2019Our estimates suggest that there are more than 22 million workers \u2013 in the U.S. alone \u2013 who are extremely negative or \u201cactively disengaged.\u201dIt costs the American economy between $250 and $300 billion every year in lost productivity alone.One poll found that an astounding 65% of Americans reported receiving no recognition for good work in the past year.At one point, I seriously began to wonder, why didn\u2019t the author change his book title to \u2018How full is your American Bucket?Seriously!There were at times I wondered what drugs this authors was on when he grounded his beliefs on ridiculous facts.For instance according to Nobel Prize-winning Daniel Kahneman, we experience approximately 20,000 individual moments in a waking day. Consider this: If you fill two buckets in a day, and the owners of those two buckets go on to fill two new buckets, more than a thousand buckets will have been filled at the end of 10 days. If each of those same people filled five buckets instead of two, more than 19 million buckets would be filled in just 10 days!And then to add to the stupidity, we also have \u201cThe Magic Ratio\u201d,It is what Positive Psychology experts believe is the frequency of small, positive acts is critical. John Gottman\u2019s research on marriages found that marriages are significantly more likely to succeed when the couple\u2019s interactions are near that 5 to 1 ratio of positive to negative. When the ratio approaches 1 to 1, marriages \u201ccascade to divorce.\u201dSo what do you do when you begin to hear stuff like this?Start complimenting your spouse 5 times for every time you snap?So with this nonsense and the extra added piece of advice, (which I remember my grandfather giving me for free) like make best friends, give unexpectedly, do unto others and frizzle frazzle dazzle, I would honestly recommend the following.If someone gives you this book, do yourself a favor.Throw it into a bucket.Not just any bucket.An American bucket.Overall rating \u2013 2 out of 10"}, {"userName": "Nick", "userReviewDate": "Dec 17, 2010", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/2393718-nick", "userReview": "Rath and Clifton pull their title and theme of the book from a metaphor for personal interaction--a bucket and a dipper. In each interaction you have with another person you either fill that person up or take away from them. Let me start by saying that I have worked for several people over the years that would have greatly benefited in their business from reading and applying this book's principles. people, especially employees, need specific recognition and/or praise. Rather than constantly focusing on negatives, we would build better work environments if we began with what is going right. While some of the principles I have know for a while, Rath and Clifton offer some specific advice in implementing these principles that I found useful and interesting. On the other hand, I can't help but read this book as a Christian and specifically as a pastor. As such, I become annoyed with a recent wave in Christianity that says, \"Just think positive thoughts and be nice to people and your life will be great!\" Thankfully, the authors don't quite go there. But if they don't go there, then they also miss some crucial elements for living your life out of a full bucket. The truth is that some people are surrounded by negative and abusive people. They have a lot of bad things happen to them. But then they are supposed to magically will themselves to have more positive interactions with people and get over their problems? I see little hope in that approach. This book never tackles that problem. It's a blind spot perhaps. However, as a Christian, I can say that a casual reading of the psalms will show a person who is the thick of doo hitting the fan that when people fail to fill our buckets God can fill us up to over-flowing. We do not have to rely on people to fill us up. All in all, I would say that this is a useful book to remind people of some Biblical principles, if they know the rest of the Story."}, {"userName": "Mir", "userReviewDate": "Sep 12, 2014", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/27612571-mir", "userReview": "I gave this book 2 stars for general concept.

As a child, I feel that I was much better at filling other people's buckets and making them feel loved and appreciated, and it's something I have failed to do as consistently as an adult. There were some fascinating studies shared in the book that showed just how much of an impact positive feedback and validation can have on an individual. I left this book with a new resolve to be better at filling others' buckets and to be more careful that I am not unknowingly dipping from their bucket instead. This was a quick easy read, that I feel had a big impact \u2013 definitely worth reading.

One simple strategy, contained in an easy to understand analogy, and everything else starts to fall together.I had heard my kids talking about bucket filling after some lessons at school. I didn\u2019t really know what they meant until after I read Tom Rath\u2019s other book EAT MOVE SLEEP (which is also an amazing book), which exposed me to the author and this, his previous work. Unlike EAT MOVE SLEEP, there isn\u2019t a lot to HOW FULL IS YOUR BUCKET. Out of the 128 pages of this book, about half are full-page quotes or illustrations. The remaining half of text is broken down into thirds\u2014the first two-thirds being the build-up to the importance of bucket filling. The final third of the book breaks down what being a bucket filler is all about.Once you become a bucket filler, so many other things fall into place: energy levels, confidence, rapport, and effective job performance\u2014among many other combined and critical elements. You could probably get the same gist by reading one of the children\u2019s books, but reading this \u201cgrown-up\u201d version relates more to the office and everyday life that adults face.If you read both of Rath\u2019s books, you\u2019ll be doing very well for yourself.
