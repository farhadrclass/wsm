Barker is undeniably unique, a few steps above Stephen King (at this point) in the whimsical world of the macabre. All fifteen of these tales are incredible-- & incredibly wicked--anecdotes, all wonderful drafts for damn-good horror flicks (bettering \"Hellraiser,\" surely) that could become classics as quintessential as Carrie, Pet Semetary or The Shining. Barker has indeed a romantic, and visceral, and uber-gross view of things, foremost a fantastic infatuation with the human body, and with the traffic of the spectral world with mortal sexuality... it's all very toxic, dabbling in the world of erotic masochism and clever motifs of collective dread.Indeed, I love the collection. It rivals the very best of King (perhaps only one of his collections hits the visceral nerve a bit more masterfully, albeit less fantastically, than \"The Books...\"). My favorites are MUSTS (read, read, read!) for those who study the short story; what makes these little nuggets of gold so golden is a true mystery in itself: \"Sex, Death and Starshine\" cleverly paints a surrealistic picture, rivaling even Dali, of the intermingling of souls with the living (a masterpiece for sure); and \"In the Hills, the Cities\" has the most memorable \"monster\" to appear out of the dark subconscious in the longest time, I think, since Frankenstein's demon. This one, too, is a masterpiece, & the imagination for such a clever Voltairesque creation seems so alien and divine as to be madly envied. And in awe of. Lastly, I kinda really dug the monster-flick tale \"Rawhide Rex\" which should be turned into a script (just looked it up, it is), as the climax is better than mostly any I could think of for a monster story. This guy, it should be clearly understood, is THE Absolute Shit."}, {"userName": "mark monday", "userReviewDate": "Aug 17, 2011", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/131922-mark-monday", "userReview": "based upon the evidence of Books of Blood 1-3, Clive Barker sprung into the literary horror world fully-formed, a writer all grown up, already past the awkward growing pains of an adolescent period that other writers of his stature and widespread appeal suffered through before reaching their full powers. his ability to construct and sustain an intriguing narrative, his resonant themes, his stylistic flourishes, his use of irony and dread and gore and comedy, his strength at detailing truly real and deeply developed characters' lives, his expertise at creating an entire world within the space of a story... these are all the traits of an author writing at his peak, and so early in his career.the stories within these collections are truly sensational: their power comes from his consistent strength at conveying sensual, physical sensation. this is not to mean that he writes sexy horror stories; rather, he is a writer who knows how to write \"body-based horror\". in many ways, these stories parallel the themes and goals of the films of David Cronenberg - the body as something alien, the body as a sacred space, the body as a target or vehicle or ideal, the body turning against itself.Peter Straub - an intellectual writer - locates his horrors within the mind: a place of murky motivation and potential evil, a site of invasion and transformation; his horrors are often as ambiguous and as ambivalent as mindspace itself. Stephen King - an emotional writer - places his horrors in scenarios that are wellsprings of sentiment and feeling, often squarely within the family unit or painful adolescence or the various dreams and ambitions of the heart itself; his horrors are often explicitly tangible things that exist to tear apart humanity's most beloved institutions. unlike those two, Barker's horrors are centered in the body as a battleground, a place where the mind and the heart are often at war. his horrors blur the boundaries of right and wrong; the various transfigurations that occur throughout his stories are often so dreadful because they are both unnervingly ambiguous and disturbingly familiar, intimate on a physical level - and in the end, almost infinitely unknowable. his bodies are places of both terror and wonder.Barker illustrates how the body can be a site of fearsome splendor and violence in the collection's first story: The Book of Blood, in which a fraud's appealing body exists first as a landscape encouraging erotic contemplation and then as a horrific diary of the dead. in the masterful Dread, a psychopathic guru lives to sadistically push his trainees past their base physical fears, and eventually meets his match in a student who has learned his lessons all too well. the horror of Jacqueline Ess comes from the terrifying protagonist's ability to wield utter control of the body itself. New Murders in the Rue Morgue revisits the classic story with a new (and rather sympathetic) focus on the idea of what truly, physically, makes a man? and in Confessions of a (Pornographer's) Shroud, the story serves as both an ironic commentary on pornography's rigorous mono-focus on body parts and as a clever rejoinder to the idea that a meat-based body is even necessary to create horror - let alone to enact bloody vengeance.the author's themes remain intact and even more visceral in those stories that are straight-up, traditionally structured servings of familiar, monster-based horror. The Midnight Meat Train features ancient, physically mortified beings who must be paid their due in flesh and has a classic \"ambiguous\" protagonist who finds his goals in life may soon be adjusted in favor of a more transformative purpose. Pig Blood Blues is wonderfully bizarre (its malevolent foil... a demonic sow!) and explicitly depicts potential physical change and transformation as an undeniable terminus for its victims, villains, and hero alike. and the now-classic Rawhead Rex has a monster whose mind dreams of domination and whose physical body yearns for both freedom and the flesh of children; his achilles' heel, his personal horror... the fertile woman, the menstrual cycle.Barker can also do comedy with an expert touch. The Yattering and the Jack is laugh-out-loud funny, a wry tale of a lower-level demon vs. The Most Boring Man in the World, a man who apparently has no terrors or temptations based in the flesh or other physical things. the quaintly nostalgic and drily amusing Sex, Death and Starshine sees the decay of the flesh and a rotting life existing beyond the grave as, well, not so bad, really.there are a few stories that are less successful, although they are by no means abortions. Hell's Event - Deadliest Marathon Ever! the entire world is at stake! - centers its horror within a runner's body. Son of Celluloid finds a lonely cancerous growth making its own body and invading a fading movie palace. Scape-Goats' horrors rise from the undisposed corpses of the long-dead and their reaction to a quartet of obnoxious tourists who obliviously pay their bodies no respect.there are three stories that are now amongst the finest modern horror stories that i've ever had the pleasure of reading. The Skins of the Fathers is an often amusing send-up of gun-toting hick americana. more importantly, in its unsettling tale of the male gender's First Fathers and their practice of holy/unholy procreation, it decribes not-so-alien physiognomies in detail - but makes the key decision to replace disgust with awe, to replace the Terrible Other with Ancient Adam (and his many brothers). Human Remains is a mordant and moody story of the escalating relationship between a street hustler/ wannabe gigolo and a being that seeks to not just mimic (and protect) that hustler's body, but also endeavors to recreate that poor fool's history into a life that contains emotional depth - rather than a life of empty ambition, callowness, and apathy. my favorite story of all 3 books is In the Hills, the Cities. this is a truly awesome tale, in all sense of the word \"awesome\"... a mind-boggling, bizarre, many-leveled account of two very different travelers and lovers, of two very similar rural villages, of an archaic tradition that replaces a many-bodied battle with two very unique bodies, of bodies coming together to create something greater, something terrible - something that the two travelers choose to either turn away from in horror or to embrace as a new form of physical being. the story is amazing.__________musical accompanimentCoil: Gold Is the Metal, Hellraiser ThemesDJ Spooky: Songs of a Dead Dreamer"}, {"userName": "Johann (jobis89)", "userReviewDate": "Nov 13, 2017", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/50893023-johann-jobis89", "userReview": "\"Everybody is a book of blood; wherever we're opened, we're red.\"Comprised of insane and downright horrifying tales from Clive Barker, Books of Blood is a strong debut release which led to King referring to him as \"the future of horror\". This edition contains Volumes 1-3, a grand total of fifteen stories (sixteen if you include the intro) - a large number of which have been subsequently adapted into movies.Having already been blown away by The Hellhound Heart, I was excited to get into more Clive Barker - and oh boy, this did not disappoint. The sheer range of stories within these first three volumes of Books of Blood is staggering. And the quality remains consistently high throughout. Barker's imagination is unparalleled - I mean, King has a pretty awesome imagination too, but his skills are slightly different to Barker's. One minute you're reading about a serial killer who quite literally skins his victims and hangs them up like pieces of meat on the subway, and the next you're reading a pretty hilarious story about a guy and the demon currently inhabiting his house trying to outdo each other.There's dark humour in some of these stories, whereas some are just pee-your-pants scary and will no doubt lead to some pretty disturbing nightmares. There's something for every horror lover in here. However, I do feel like it's necessary to warn people that a high proportion of these stories have a lot of blood and gore in them - it is the Books of Blood after all - so if you're not a fan of this, maybe this collection isn't for you. I just don't want anyone to read these on my recommendation and think I'm some sicko (I kinda am, but that's a discussion for another day). BUT it's also important that I point out that the gore isn't gratuitous or included merely for the \"shock value\" - in my opinion, anyway.I'm still finding it so strange to be reading sentences that are meant to be graphic and disturbing, yet they're still poignant and beautiful. Barker has a real talent for examining the beauty of horror. He seems to have a fascination with the human body and it's reflected in his writing. The book just drips with sex and violence, and I'm more than cool with that.I generally loved the majority of these, so it's difficult to pick a favourite, but standouts for me were: The Midnight Meat Train, The Yattering and Jack, Scape-Goats, Rawhead Rex... yeah, I'm close to just naming them all. However, a special mention must go to In the Hills, The Cities. I've honestly never read a story like this - such a unique, fascinating idea. Imagery I'll never ever forget. Wow. Initially I had intended to delve right into volumes 4-6 soon after finishing this... but I think I'm going to wait a while. Like a semi-reasonable junkie, I want to know that my next hit is still out there... just waiting for me to pick it up. This gets ALL THE STARS. 5 stars out of 5!"}, {"userName": "Paul Bryant", "userReviewDate": "Dec 11, 2013", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/416390-paul-bryant", "userReview": "One hit wonders \u2013 I usually think of such oddities as Nena (99 Red Balloons, UK No 1, 1984) or Aneka (Japanese Boy, UK No 1, 1981), or even Sir Mix-a-Lot (Baby Got Back, US No 1, 1992) \u2013 a No 1 hit and then nothing, nothing, nothing. But of course you do get one hit wonder authors \u2013 the toppermost one in that list will be Harper Lee. OMG can you imagine the advance she would have got for her second novel? And it could happen, she\u2019s still here, 87 years old. We remember it took Henry Roth 60 years to follow up Call it Sleep. Also, Ralph Ellison never published a second novel. (He wrote one but his house burned down - damn!) And we\u2019re still waiting for a second novel from Arthur (Geisha) Golden (16 years). But actually, a one hit wonder isn\u2019t someone who never did anything else but who only ever had one hit \u2013 so Margaret Mitchell, Bram Stoker, Herman Melville, Antoine de Saint-Exupery, etc etc. Anyhow, I read this story, it was In the Hills, the Cities by Clive Barker and it was one of the all time greatest stories I ever read, hair-raisingly original, perfectly expressed, awesome. Everyone should read this story. I therefore eventually got Books of Blood, thinking that there would be more where that came from. But there wasn\u2019t. The other stuff was just like Aneka\u2019s follow-up to Japanese Boy if she was singing about creatures from hell biting some random guy\u2019s nether parts off.

And gory. And transgressive as hell. Reading this book made it clear to me why Clive Barker (who I hadn't read before) is considered an iconic writer. The man is not only a master stylist, but he has this narrative obsession with tearing reality apart. Sometimes a form of religion or systematic afterlife is involved like in The Midnight Meat Train or Hell's Event. Other time, it's just off the wall wild and imaginative like In the Hills, the Cities. My favorite stories from the collection were Pig Blood Blues, Dread and the weirdo-Lynchian Son of Celluloid. Luxuriant, consistant, transgressive...my first experience with Clive Barker is a rather transforming one.Get on that, people and lose your mind.

Las historias aqui contenidas son de lo mejor del g\u00e9nero y cuesta elegir s\u00f3lo algunas porque la calidad es muy alta.Destacar\u00eda las siguientes:El Libro de Sangre: Una historia que sirve de introducci\u00f3n y nexo a todo lo que vendr\u00e1 despues.

This edition collected the three Books of Blood into one edition. Clive Barker, though not as well known as Stephen King, is well known for his Hellraiser stories. As with any anthology the end result is determined by the stories therein. The Books of Blood does not fail, for the most part, to deliver some truly gory (Barker seems to relish in the more blood and guts aspect of horror) and downright bizarre horror stories.The volume starts with a rather eerie quote from Mr. Barker himself:\"Everybody is a book of blood; Wherever we're opened, we're red.\" Then we are off to the races-Vol 1- this starts the anthology with the Book of Blood story that sets into motion the book. While it wasn't bad, it had more of a \"set-up\" feel to be the story that acts as a prologue. But volume one does have some true gems- \"The Midnight Meat Train\" is a great story about serial killers, a strange train and the horrific City Father; \"The Yattering and Jack\" was a fascinating, darkly funny story about a minor demon haunting a phlegmatic individual in an attempt to drive him insane. I truly enjoyed this story, not only the plot but the ending is excellent. \"Pig Blood Blues\" about a strange reformatory for young boys and the new teacher who starts work there is also well done. These three stories are 5/5 material. The last two stories: \"Sex, Death and Starshine\" and \"In the Hills, the Cities\"- had some original parts, but overall I didn't care much for the stories (both rate a 3/5) though they aren't bad. The former having to do with a run down theater and some spirits who just love to perform, the latter story is just bizarre (though original, I will admit) about two battling cities in Yugoslavia (it was written in 1984).Book Two follows the superb Book One with some gems of its own: \"Dread\"- the story of a dark-hearted Psychology grad student who wants to find out what really causes dread and encounters some unintended consequences. It was a grim tale, but I enjoyed the psychological undercurrent in the tale. \"Hell's Event\" was also an original look at the concept of running for your life. Again, an interesting and original take on a rather common story. \"The Skins of the Fathers\", is a story that takes place in a small town out in the US West. It is a story about a boy who might not be a human and the quest of his \"fathers\" to find him. Finally \"New Murders in the Rue Morgue\" is a nice spin on the original Poe tale. These four tales from Book Two were all very good. The last story in volume two is also it's weakest. \"Jacqueline Ess: Her Will and Testament\" was a story that I did not care for. It just never clicked with me and I could have cared less. While every other story in Book Two is in the 4-5/5 range, the Jacqueline Ess story is, maybe, a two.Book Three finishes off the anthology with-\"Son of Celluloid\"- which was not bad, a 3/5. It is an odd mix of cancer and the movies. Book Three has one of my favorite Barker creations, other than Pin-Head the Cenobite, and he is the title and primary character- \"Rawhead Rex\". A great horror tale of an ancient being who has been released from his tomb and the bloody rampage he goes on. This is a great short story. The \"Confessions of a (Pornographer's) Shroud\" is also a strong showing (4/5) about a wrongly murdered and framed man whose ghost haunts a shroud and seeks revenge. Both \"Scape Goats\" and \"Human Remains\" are not bad, but nothing great (3/5). The former has to do with a mysterious island and the odd sight of three goats just hanging out; the latter story has to do with an ancient statue that has decided life as a person it's next stage of development.All these three books were put into the Books of Blood anthology. For the most part-all of the stories are good. Some of them are excellent and only one is poor. That is quite a good showing for any anthology. If you are a fan of horror or S. King then do give Mr. barker a try. He doesn't disappoint."}, {"userName": "Jos\u00e9 Nebreda", "userReviewDate": "Jun 28, 2016", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/23529318-jos-nebreda", "userReview": "Recuerdos de mi lejana adolescencia.

Clive Barker's genius as a horror writer is making the terrifying familiar. This collection of short stories, tenuously held together by the precept that they are the stories carved into the flesh of a fake medium by vengeful ghosts, has no part of King's familiarity. Instead, it plunges the reader headlong into the multiple worlds of the unfamiliar and horrific, but brings the unspeakably evil so close to home that you can't help but identify with it, and in so doing give a piece of yourself up to terror. Of course there are a few duds here (\"Sex, Death and Starshine\", in which a theater troupe is haunted by a ghost that only wants to kill them to make them an undead group of performers, for instance), but the vast majority of the stories are so creative and so horrific that you can't resist. Highlights include \"In the Hills, the City\", in which two entire Eastern-European cities band together for a centuries-old rivalry the likes of which no man has ever dreamt of in his most horrible dreams, and \"Dread\", in which a demented philosopher forces his victims to face their worst fears in order to become more perfect human beings. This is definitely not a book for the squeamish. It's full of graphic mutilation and nightmare-inducing ideas. But it truly marks a turning point for horror, where mere ghost stories and rabid dogs would no longer be enough to scare an increasingly jaded readership. It is the point that allowed for luminaries like House of Leaves and The Ruins, where strangeness and unimaginable horror became the norm."}, {"userName": "Thomas", "userReviewDate": "Aug 22, 2007", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/244519-thomas", "userReview": "A horror classic.

Written in his spare time, he admits that he was not expecting them to sell really at all, let alone predict the public response that followed. The release exploded within the horror literature genre, hailing Barker as an exciting and imaginative newcomer. Stephen King, already known as a master in the genre, went as far as to pronounce Clive to be \"the future of horror\". The books won both the British and World Fantasy Awards, as the public lapped up the gore soaked pages. After this initial success, Barker followed with a final three volumes, creating a collective masterpiece of horror. His two omnibus's were later to be broken down, to be sold as individual books which Barker was invited to be able to illustrate the covers for with his dark and twisted artwork. The books have since been put back together again into these two large collections. The books were moderately successful in Great Britain, but found wide critical acclaim in the United States. Their popularity and the sheer amount of sales have found the books repeatedly reprinted and available in over a dozen languages. These books are a must-read for anyone who enjoys reading books from the horror genre. They are also an important stage within the work of Clive Barker forming a solid point for his writing to work from. Here we have the first three volumes from the collection of six. Released in their individual forms back in 1985, this omnibus was later reprinted by Warner Books in 1994. The book was printed with different cover artwork (done by Bob Warner) and is the current version on sale of this dark and twisted masterpiece. This first collection contains the following short stories: The Book Of Blood - 12 pages \"The dead have their highway. They carve their stories on the walls and the flesh. Everybody is a book of blood; Wherever we're opened, we're red\". This first opener (pardon the pun), brings you a well-constructed and haunting tale to bring together all of the short stories and introduce the reader to the books of blood. It forms a small taste of what is to come, whetting the appetite for Barker's tales of the macabre. The Midnight Meat Train - 25 pages \"A stomach-churning ride on the New York subway, to feed the Old Gods on human meat\". This short was inspired and created around a sultry summer visit to New York in which Barker found himself lost on a subway at midnight. The tale is a bitter and twisted one, as we are treated to Barker's dark imagination and talent for setting down a vivid and disturbing tale. The story is quickly dropped into a festering pit of gore, with extreme mutilation and blood-spill dripping from each page. The tale concludes with a haunting ending, as we are treated to nothing less than pure Barker genius. The story was later adapted in 1990 into the graphic novel `Tapping The Vein - Book 3' where it was illustrated by Denys Cowan and Michael Davis.. - The Yattering And Jack - 20 pages \"Man versus Demon, in a black comedy of lunatic violence\". Here we have a short that unfolds a comical tale that will amuse and entertain. The storyline is simple yet packed with purpose. The twist ending is subtle and forms a nice little conclusion to the story. The story was later adapted by Steve Niles in 1991 into the Eclipse Books graphic novel `The Yattering And Jack' where it was illustrated by John Bolton. The story was also adapted for the 1986 release of `The Tales From The Darkside - Volume 5' which was a 20 minute film made for TV broadcast. It starred Tony Carbone (The Pit And The Pendulum) as was available from Worldvision Home Video. - Pig Blood Blues - 29 pages \"They told Redman the pig was possessed, but he didn't believe...until the nightmare came trotting after him\". Barker offers up a disturbing and haunting tale of possession and dark corruption. The story bleeds paranoia as it slowly winds itself to the horrific conclusion, building up with heart-racing tension. This is one of those stories that will come back to haunt you time and time again. The story was later adapted in 1989 into the graphic novel `Tapping The Vein - Book 1' where it was illustrated by Scott Hampton. - Sex, Death And Starshine - 36 pages \"The show must go on. Even if the audience has just risen from the dead\". This gripping story brings you a well-written tale that works upon an underlying suspense that gnaws at you from the inside. The story spirals to an awesome and dramatic twist, which will leave you dying to read more. - In The Hills, The Cities - 27 pages \"There are monsters nobody has ever dared imagine before; vast enough to take your breath away. And they're waiting in the hills\". Barker's imagination runs wild here as we are confronted with this terrifying and impressive tale. Vividly described and cleverly constructed, this story will impress and amaze you with Barker's creation of the darkly fantastic. This short will leave you truly shocked. One of my personal favourite from the whole collection. The story was later adapted in 1989 into the graphic novel `Tapping The Vein - Book 2' where it was illustrated by John Bolton. Dread - 34 pages \"One man's obsession with fear drives his victims one step beyond sanity, to unspeakable slaughter\". A nasty little opening story for this second volume. Here we have a tale of fear and desperation, as the story revolves around the psychological state of its principal characters. The short is well-written, forming a vivid scenario of utter fear and dread as the horrors mount to a dramatic conclusion. The story was later adapted by Fred Burke in 1992 into the Eclipse Books graphic novel `Dread' where it was illustrated by Dan Brerton. Hell's Event - 23 pages \"The race is on. And the Devil will take the hindmost\". A gripping and enjoyable story that keeps you entertained throughout. The pace never slows down as you race through this fiendishly dark and twisted storyline. The story was later adapted in 1990 into the graphic novel `Tapping The Vein - Book 4' where it was illustrated by Steven E. Johnson, Alan Okamoto and Jim Perason. Jacqueline Ess: Her Will And Testament - 33 pages \"A story of sex and power, and the bloodbath that awaits us at the limits of desire\". This story holds a little glimpse of the Barker that will unfold in the later years, with his outstanding imagination for redefining the properties of the flesh. This is an erotic story that decays into something bizarre and twisted as Barker delves deeper into his imagination. One of my personal favourites. The Skins Of The Fathers - 32 pages \"Once, they had fattened a human child, these monsters from beneath the desert. Now they want him back\". This short is packed with suspension and mystery as we are carefully taken on a haunting trip into this dark offering of horror. The storyline spirals to a dramatic ending with eerie reminders of ideas used within `Lord Of Illusions' and maybe even `Cabal' / `Nightbreed'. A gripping and enjoyable read. The story was later adapted in 1989 into the graphic novel `Tapping The Vein - Book 2' where it was illustrated by Klaus Janson. New Murders In The Rue Morgue - 27 pages \"History is about to repeat itself in Poe's notorious street, as old horrors return to shed new blood\". Centred around the principal idea that Edgar Allan Poe's classic story The Murders in the Rue Morgue is actually the work of fact not fiction. This weird and horrific story, sets out a mysterious and compelling storyline as we are treated to some classic Barker horror. The story was later adapted by Steve Niles in 1993 into the Eclipse Books graphic novel `The Life Of Death' where it was illustrated by Hector Gomez. Son Of Celluloid - 35 pages \"When an escaped convict commits murder and finds his way to a decaying movie palace, he cannot know that his own life is about to end, while the dreams of a half-decade's moviegoers are just beginning. For this convict's cancerous tumor refuses to die, and the angels of the cinema can grant mirages and nightmares of their own.\" Inspired by the beaten up revival cinema Barker frequented many times back in Liverpool, in which so many films fuelled his imagination as a young man. The short is a heavy dousing of pure horror, with a fast-paced storyline and underlying tension that mounts throughout. The story was later adapted by Steve Niles in 1991 into the Eclipse Books graphic novel `Son Of Celluloid' where it was illustrated by Les Edwards. Rawhead Rex - 47 pages \"Rawhead it was called because its head was huge and raw like meat. It was the last of a line of kings dating from before civilization, before Christ, when England was forest all over and the home of unspeakable horror. The ultimate monster is on the loose, with a hunger that won't be satisfied this side of Hell\". Adapted into a movie back in 1987, Barker was highly dissatisfied with it and so went on to take up the directors chair himself with his own adaptation of the story `The Hellbound Heart' which became the cult movie `Hellraiser'. The short story `Rawhead Rex' is an incredibly violent and gore-filled offering, with this ungodly creature on a complete rampage. The ending is deep within the weird and supernatural world in which Barker will later submerge himself. A highly enjoyable tale of horror. The story was later adapted by Steve Niles in 1993 into the Eclipse Books graphic novel `Rawhead Rex' where it was illustrated by Lionel Talaro. Confession Of A (Pornographer's) Shroud - 32 pages \"When the Porn Kings tortured Ronnie Glass to death they didn't believe in Resurrection. They do now\". A nasty little tale of revenge and evil torment. The story is gripping and rammed with suspense from the start. It's well-written and powerful with its vivid and, in places, horrific depictions. Scapegoats - 25 pages \"Four lost people on a lost island, with the dead calling from the sea\". Written from the first-person perspective of a young woman, Scapegoats boasts a tale of underlying horror and ritual slaughter. It depicts a vivid tension in the air that will put you not at ease throughout. The tale is dark and bizarre, with a horrific and evil conclusion which is a little unsettling, leaving you wondering the taunting world of Barker's creation. Another one of my favourites from the Books Of Blood series. The story was later adapted in 1990 into the graphic novel `Tapping The Vein - Book 3' where it was illustrated by Bo Hampton. Human Remains - 42 pages \"Gavin was a whore, happy to sell his body for hard cash. Until he met the creature that wanted to own his flesh forever\". A typical Barker style of offering here, with the corruption of the nature of the flesh. The story includes brutal violence in places with splatters of gore and bloodshed. The short is perverse and darkly erotic in places with sudden bursts of the horrific. Pure genius. The story was later adapted in 1989 into the graphic novel `Tapping The Vein - Book 1' where it was illustrated by P. Craig Russel."}, {"userName": "Midnyte Reader", "userReviewDate": "Oct 20, 2011", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/3726186-midnyte-reader", "userReview": "This book took me a long time to get through. It is not light reading. It sucks you down into its bloody, gory depth. From the very first story, the \u201cframe\u201d so to speak, that explains what the Books of Blood are to the last ghostly saga. I enjoy a good gore-fest, yet I realized I was making faces at some of the details of intricate violence and troubling images. It\u2019s not just random blood and violence however. At the heart of it, the stories are just good stories. They are deep and well thought out, imaginative and surprising. They are written with words strung together in a gorgeous, lush tableau. Descriptions reach ambitious heights. The writing is also brutal and gritty and the mood is dark, proving that Horror can be both beautiful and disturbing. Don\u2019t let anyone tell you different. What I also really enjoyed is that as prolific as Barker\u2019s writing is, it does not seem forced to me. It flows and slides and creeps and batters you so naturally and casually, you just sort of accept it and come to expect it.Sex, Death and Starshine is a wonderfully, creepy ghost story and The Yattering and Jack is a hilarious yarn about a demon who is trying to best a man, but all his efforts are thwarted. It is so clever and refreshing because of the humor. New Murders in the Rue Morgue is a murder mystery as intriguing as its predecessor and takes the tale a step farther. For me, Rawhead Rex is brilliant. The murderous villain, his origins and the hints throughout are woven together not only to create a horror story, but a re-telling of a folklore story.I feel confident in also saying that many of the stories could be studied in feminism, sexuality, and psychology courses. And, if you\u2019re so inclined could raise discussions of what is behind bondage, mutilation and control. But I think the most inherent trait in the stories is suspense, fear and dread (and one of the stories is actually called Dread and explores this emotion). One thing that was a tad lacking for me are the characters and I didn\u2019t realize this until I got to one of the last stories, Scape Goat, which is written in first person and I realized I connected with the main character, Frankie. She took me more into the story while with the other characters I felt more as if I were watching theirs. (The other character I really like is Birdy from Sons of Celluloid. Maybe because she is a strong female.) This really didn\u2019t diminish my enjoyment of the book, it\u2019s just something I noticed. I also appreciated the foreward by Mr. Barker as he reflects on his stories which were written many years ago, the horror genre in general and himself as well and how he has changed. I feel this is a must for Horror aficionados. The concepts are inspired, the writing is superb and the stories are just exceptional in their inventiveness."}, {"userName": "Jenna", "userReviewDate": "Jul 10, 2009", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/1753805-jenna", "userReview": "(not my review): \"A friend of mine, years ago, gave me this, and I read the first two stories and was like, \u201cI can\u2019t handle this.\u201d Then I read an interview with Alan Moore, and he was talking about how \u201cBooks of Blood\u201d is one of the greatest collections of short stories ever.

And each story only to seemed to get crazier than the last one. Eventually, I was just worn out and haven't read Barker since.I admire the guy, though. What he lacked in sympathetic characters--people you wanted to identify with--he more than made up with pure imaginary genius. They put pictures in your head that never go away. Not just the extreme stuff, but things like Yugoslav peasants bundling together to make a leviathan while two British gay guys are trying to enjoy a holiday; a billionaire trying to create a Hell on Earth in the confines of an enormous mansion; a potion turning humans into sex-crazed monsters to the point where holes in brick walls....See, I'm just paraphrasing and already you're corrupted."}, {"userName": "Rade ", "userReviewDate": "Jan 16, 2013", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/8187431-rade", "userReview": "Barker is awesome. Each one of the stories in this collection is unique in a way where you will read it and not find any similarities to the one that came before it. A lot of them start off quite innocently and make you think they might not be too special, but than the author slaps you in the face and invents some form of supernatural theme to the rest of the story. Some stories are sexual in nature, some are violent, some are dramatic, and some are all of the above. The themes are also all over the place but a lot are meant for people with open mind. The writing is perfect and the characters are good, never too pretentious or annoying. As with any other collection of short stories, some stories are better than others. This one is not any different. My favorite stories are \"The Midnight Meat Train,\"\"The Yattering and Jack,\" \"Rawhead Rex,\" and \"Human Remains.\" I like the rest but these were the best in my opinion. Some are very short while others can go on for more than 40 pages (which is quite short too)."}, {"userName": "Amber", "userReviewDate": "Aug 14, 2013", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/23016460-amber", "userReview": "I got this short story collection last year as a christmas gift and I finished it at the first of the year.

A psychic researcher, Mary Florescu, has employed a quack medium named Simon McNeal to investigate a haunted house. Alone in an upstairs room, McNeal at first fakes visions, but then the ghosts really do come for him. They attack him and carve words in his flesh, and these words, claims the narrator, form the rest of the stories, stories written on a literal, living Book of Blood. This prologue, along with closing story \"On Jerusalem Street\" from Volume Six, was adapted and directed into the film Book of Blood by John Harrison.The Midnight Meat TrainA down-and-out man, Leon Kaufman, falls asleep on a New York subway train, only to wake up at a secret station beyond the end of the line. Kaufman encounters a man named Mahogany, who has killed and butchered several people and hung their bodies up on the train. Mahogany remarks that he will be forced to kill Kaufman to guard his secrets. Kaufman fights Mahogany and kills him in self-defense, but then the train doors open and strange malformed creatures board the train. The creatures eat the dead passengers, then force Kaufman to serve them as their new butcher, cutting out his tongue to ensure his silence. They tell Kaufman that Mahogany was getting old and could not do the job any longer, and that Kaufman now has a new career. It is also revealed that the creatures have also been the secret rulers of New York City for centuries. The police have always covered up for the creatures. Kaufman finds he now has lifetime employment. The Yattering and JackJack Polo is a gherkin importer who's haunted by a minor demon called the Yattering. This demon is commanded to haunt Jack by Beelzebub, the \"Lord of the Flies\", in retaliation for an ancestor of Jack's who did not fulfill his part of a deal he made with Hell. Despite its determined efforts to drive Jack mad, the Yattering is frustrated by his good cheer and apparent obliviousness. Unknown to the Yattering, Jack is well aware of the demon and what it is trying to accomplish. He purposely ignores the demon to frustrate it and to keep from going insane. Bound by the powers of Hell to stay in Jack's house until it succeeds, the Yattering subjects him to increasingly severe torments, killing his cats and terrorizing his family, but all fail. Eventually Jack tricks it into leaving the house and attacking him, and by violating the orders of its demonic masters, the Yattering becomes Jack's servant. Unusual for Barker's early work, this story is unabashedly comic. It was made into an episode of the horror anthology TV series Tales From The Darkside.Pig Blood BluesA supernatural story set in a borstal. A former policeman named Redman, who starts working there, uncovers a deadly secret and a boy named Lacey is the centre of it. Lacey claims that a missing boy by the name of Henessey is actually there on the grounds of the facility, in the form of a ghost. As Redman unravels the mystery he finds that things are not what they seem and the giant pig in the sty located on the north end of the grounds is actually possessed by the soul of Henessey, who transferred his soul into the pig in order to live forever. \"This is the state of the beast. ...to eat and be eaten.\"Sex, Death and StarshineTerry Calloway is directing the William Shakespeare play Twelfth Night in a disused and failing theatre called The Elysium. The production is not going well, but Terry is in a distracted affair with his leading lady Viola, Diane Duvall. She was on a soap opera and is a wonderful blow, but, on the stage, is dreadful. A mysterious, rather theatrical man in a mask, Mr. Lichfield, tells him that his wife, Constantia, would have done better. However, aside from the problem of his wife being dead, Terry cannot replace Diane Duvall since her popularity would have such a positive effect on the show's publicity.Days pass, and Terry worries about the play, but Mr. Lichfield reassures him.Then, the day of the show Mr. Lichfield catches Terry and Diane in the middle of sex (and after an embarrassing moment for Terry in which he leaves) confronts her about her lack of \"style\" on the stage and states that his wife will play the role of Viola on the following day's opening night. Diane uncovers the face behind the mask and finds that Mr. Lichfield is actually the walking dead. Mr. Lichfield then kisses Diane and she slips into a coma. His wife is introduced as the new Viola while Diane is taken to intensive care. However, Diane returns later and finds Terry, stating that they need to \"finish\". After believing that Diane has recovered, Terry realises that she is in fact dead, while she is giving him fellatio. She finds out that he knows, and dispatches with him.The play is performed to a packed house, however, once the performance is finished (and the blinding stage lights are extinguished), the actors realise that the audience were in fact ghosts and corpses in diverse states of decay. The former trustee, newly dead Tallulah, who had been stoking a fire during the production, burns the theatre down. Every living player in the production is killed.The story ends with several of the actors and Terry joining Mr. Lichfield and Constantia on the road as ghost actors\u2014as they've decided to devote their life, and death, to the art.In the Hills, the CitiesTwo gay men, Mick and Judd, go on a romantic but strained vacation in Yugoslavia. In an isolated rural area, there happens an astounding event: two entire cities, Popolac and Podujevo, create massive communal creatures by binding together the bodies of their citizens, with almost forty thousand people walking as the body of a single giant, as tall as a skyscraper. It's a ritual that occurs every ten years, but this time, things go wrong, and the Podujevo giant collapses, killing thirty-eight thousand, seven hundred and sixty five citizens horribly.They come upon the smashed bodies of Podujevo and a ravine awash with blood, but at first do not see the City of Popolac walking behind nearby hills. Meanwhile, in shock, the entire population of Popolac goes mad, and in losing their individual minds actually become the giant they are strapped into. Popolac wanders the hills aimlessly. By nightfall many of the people who made up the giant die from exhaustion, but still it walks.Mick and Judd are told the truth about the giants by a local man who tried to steal their car in order to catch up with Popolac and reason with it before it collapses and destroys the people who compose it. But they at first do not believe his story. They seek shelter at a remote farm, but Popolac blunders right into the farmhouse that night. Its giant foot kills Judd by accident. The elderly farm couple, who saw Popolac, go crazy with fear. Mick, seeing Popolac, goes insane too, but wants to join Popolac. He climbs up the tower of ropes and bodies, and is carried away as it walks into the hills to its fate.Volume TwoDreadA young student, Steve, becomes acquainted with an older student named Quaid. Quaid is an intellectual with a morbid fascination with fear. He eventually shows Steve how he, Quaid, kidnapped a vegetarian woman and imprisoned her in a room with merely a steak for sustenance, only releasing her when she finally overcame her dread of eating meat in order to prevent starvation; she eats the meat even though it has spoiled. Steve becomes Quaid's next candidate for his experiments, held captive in a dark, silent room, forcing him to relive a childhood period of deafness that terrified him. Steve is driven insane by this forced sensory deprivation and eventually returns to Quaid's house and butchers him with an axe. Quaid's experiments, all along, were to try to help him understand the nature of fear, but ironically his experiments in phobias made his own worst fears come to life.Every one-hundred years, a race is held in London. Satan sends one of his representatives to run it against the (unsuspecting) human runners. If Satan's minion wins, then he, Satan, gets to rule the Earth. An athlete taking part in the event, Joel, begins to realise the true meaning of things and what is at stake when his fellow human competitors begin to fall, savaged by some unseen beast. We also learn of the deal a satanist, Gregory, makes with Hell. He has staked his life and soul on this race. Meanwhile, Joel does not win the race due to a struggle with Hell's shape-shifting runner, who bites off Joel's face. However, the last surviving runner jogs past them to the finishing line. Hell loses out once again. Gregory is hardly surprised when he is punished for his overconfidence by being gruesomely slain.Jacqueline Ess: Her Will And TestamentJacqueline Ess is a housewife who attempts suicide after becoming bored with her life. She recovers only to find that she has an ability to change people's body shapes simply with her mind. She accidentally kills her therapist and then - somewhat less accidentally - kills her husband, simply by willing their bodies into tearing apart or folding in on themselves. One man becomes obsessed with her and tracks her down. Jacqueline eventually becomes a prostitute, her abilities giving her the power to give men the ultimate sexual experience, albeit one that always proves fatal. She has by now lost control of herself and has to be watched while sleeping in case she unconsciously mutilates her own body. The man obsessed with her eventually makes love to Jacqueline and they willingly die together by Jacqueline's powers.The Skins of the FathersDavidson is stuck in Arizona after his car breaks down. He then witnesses a bizarre parade of freakish monsters. It turns out that these creatures mated with a woman in a nearby town six-years previously and are intending on reclaiming the child, which they promptly achieve. Davidson reaches the town where a posse of gun-toting locals are eager to set out to slay the monsters. Everything goes wrong, however, and Davidson and just a few other survivors end up with a horrific fate; they sink in quicksand which then hardens when they are half-buried (one man is left with just his face exposed, the rest of him in the solidified ground) and are left for dead in the burning desert heat.This was used in a scene in the movie, Lord of Illusions, which is in turn based on a book by Barker.New Murders in the Rue MorgueLewis is a seventy-three-year-old man who goes to Paris after his friend, Phillipe, is arrested for butchering a young woman. Phillipe eventually commits suicide in his cell after babbling about an orangutan who committed the murder he had been arrested for. Lewis does not believe it until he sees the primate - dressed like a human, completely shaved, and wielding a razor - for himself. The beast had been raised by Philippe, a notorious eccentric, as a strange experiment on Edgar Allan Poe's classic story.Volume ThreeSon of CelluloidAn escaped convict dies behind a movie screen. After his death, his cancerous tumor gains sentience, over the years, from the strong emotions of the movie theater's audiences and torments the few people that remain after a show. The sole survivor of the massacre is seen some time later, having tracked down the murderous entity which was roaming the country after possessing the body of a young girl unaccounted for after the events. She covers the creature with acid, killing it completely.Rawhead RexAn ancient, malevolent monster, magically imprisoned underground, is accidentally awakened in the town of Zeal, Kent. Rawhead is a nine-foot humanoid with a huge, toothed head, and is extremely ferocious. Rawhead goes on a rampage, killing and eating people, including two children. He corrupts the local Verger, who surrenders to the violent, depraved impulses that Rawhead represents, and who helps the monster slay the Vicar, Coot.Rawhead sets Zeal alight, and is eventually overcome by Ron, father of one of Rawhead's victims, who uses a talisman to stall the beast until he is overrun by a mob of enraged village folk. The talisman depicts a pregnant woman, Rawhead's antithesis and the only thing he fears.Rawhead Rex has a structure similar to Alien or The Thing from Another World, but uses a disturbing rural setting. It touches on themes of maleness and femaleness and the decline of rural England. Confessions of a (Pornographer's) ShroudRonnie is a strait-laced Catholic man who is set up to look like the king of a pornography cartel. He kills some of his enemies, but is murdered by their cohorts. Awakening as a ghost, he possesses the shroud that covers his body in the morgue, and in the shape of the shroud takes revenge on the rest of his enemies. In a gory finale, he enters the mouth of the man responsible for his ordeal and turns him inside out, literally.Despite containing graphic descriptions of acts of extreme violence, the story is written as a black comedy, revolving around the visual gag of a real ghost looking like someone wearing a bedsheet over his or her head.Scape-GoatsA yacht is stranded on the beach of a deserted island. The island is located at a point in the North Atlantic ocean where converging undersea currents bring all the human bodies of sailors and those who drown in the sea. The hundreds of bodies littering the ocean floor, unfortunately for the stranded crew, aren't as dead as they should be.Human RemainsA young gay prostitute is hired by an archeologist. During the course of night he stumbles into the bathroom to discover a Roman-esque statue of a man lying in the bath. Over the next few weeks he has the sense of being followed and being haunted by a doppelg\u00e4nger. At the same time, his mind and body transforms; he becomes cold and lifeless, no longer needing to eat or sleep. He finally discovers his doppelganger, the statue from the bath, at his father's grave, crying in sorrow, while he is unmoved. It becomes clear that the doppelganger has become more convincing as a human than he is, and he wanders away, allowing it to continue living in his persona."}, {"userName": "William Collins", "userReviewDate": "Dec 27, 2017", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/51116319-william-collins", "userReview": "As with all collections of short stories, some are a lot better than others, as is the case here.In my opinion, Pig blood blues and Midnight Meat Train are the clear stand-outs.

I'd heard his name here and there, but had never really paid him any attention until recently when I ordered a few of his books on a whim, Books of Blood Vol. 1-3 among them.I've read the first three entries in the Books of Blood series and, well, color me a Clive Barker fan. Within this collection is some of the grisliest horrors I've ever encountered -- scares not meant for the light at heart. As I've said, I've read horror for years and thought I had been case hardened... not so, apparently. Barker truly got under my skin with at least 2/3 of these stories. Some of these stories made me physically sick -- on the verge of vomiting or crying -- and others made me hesitant to turn the light out at night. That is not hyperbole. I've yet to read a horror author with such an expansive imagination or tight grip on what makes for truly successful visceral horror. For the sake of time and my sanity, I am going to review each story in only a sentence or two, followed by a ranking. I'll try to come up with something unique to say about each story, which should not be too hard in most cases. Here we go... Books of Blood, Volume 1Book of Blood: The title story sets up the collection quite nicely, letting the reader know he or she is in for a grisly, gory ride through the night where monsters roam and usually win. It's a memorable story all its own, immediately memorable and chilling. 5/5The Midnight Meat Train: This is one of the stories that made me almost throw up, and I'm not sure if I would read it again. However, the writing here is incredibly strong and Barker takes the serial killer trope in interesting, fresh directions. 4.5/5The Yattering and Jack: This story is equal parts funny and scary. Wholly original stuff. Is it a movie? 5/5 Pig Blood Blues: This is the first story in the collection that concerns a wide(r) casts of characters, and is a fun, enchanted tale of possession and sacrifice. The ending is among the darkest here. It drags a bit in places, but overall it's a great tale. 4/5Sex, Death, and Starshine: Clive Barker's history as a screenwriter really comes through in this ghostly, sexy tale of a theater cast that goes on long after the final curtain has descended. Again, this story drags in places, thus earning it only 4 stars. 4/5 In the Hills, the Cities: Among this collection's most well-known, and for good reason. It's among the grisliest tales here, and the way Barker writes about two warring cities fighting one another is unlike anything I've ever read before. Warning: this story is one of the homoerotic in the bunch, so if you're not into that you might want to skip this one. 5/5 Books of Blood, Volume 2Dread: Quite easily my favorite story in the entire collection. I really don't want to say anything about this one except it really lives up to its title. A masterwork of slow-building horror. 5/5 Hell's Event: Volume 2 is probably my least favorite Books of Blood volume, and its slight downward spiral starts here. Occasional funny stuff can be found, but it's mostly stale and boring. 2/5 Jacqueline Ess: Her Will and Testament: A seductive woman has special powers of the mind she can control and use to her own gain. Like a lot of the stories here, this one is equal parts creepy and sexy but I couldn't really get into it for some reason... 2.5/5The Skins of the Fathers: This story is a bit of a breath of fresh air after the previous two stories -- which are not bad, but aren't very noteworthy either -- and I really enjoyed it. The abusive father and the chilling ending stick out the most in my mind. 4/5 New Murders In The Rue Morgue: A boring update on an old Edgar Allen Poe story. Pass. 1/5Books of Blood, Volume 3Son of Celluloid: A dying man's cancer joins with the emotions in the air at an old movie theater, coming together to form a murderous monster made up of famous movie scenes. It's trippy and doesn't make a whole lot of sense upon retelling, but just read it. This story is a prime example of Clive Barker's extensive imagination. 5/5 Rawhead Rex: A small town is under siege of a blood-thirsty supernatural being that has come back to life. Need I say more? 5/5 Confessions of a (Pornographer's) Shroud: A fair-minded family man is brutally murdered and comes back to take revenge. This one is a fitting, modern follow-up to \"Rawhead Rex\" and is one I immediately reread. 5/5 Scape-Goats: The deserted island setting of this one brings to mind Stephen King's \"Survivor Type\" only with a lot more corpses... 5/5 Human Remains: This one isn't quite as good as the stories the precede it in this volume, but it's still fairly interesting and scary. 3.5/5 So... yeah. In case you didn't get the point, Clive Barker is a scary writer and you should check him out as soon as possible. These stories are dark, oppressive, and don't let in much light, thus making them phenomenal Halloween reads."}], "description": "\"Everybody is a book of blood; wherever we're opened, we're red.\" For those who only know Clive Barker through his long multigenre novels, this one-volume edition of the Books of Blood is a welcome chance to acquire the 16 remarkable horror short stories with which he kicked off his career. For those who already know these tales, the poignant introduction is a window on the creator's mind. Reflecting back after 14 years, Barker writes:  I look at these pieces and I don't think the man who wrote them is alive in me anymore.... We are all our own graveyards I believe; we squat amongst the tombs of the people we were. If we're healthy, every day is a celebration, a Day of the Dead, in which we give thanks for the lives that we lived; and if we are neurotic we brood and mourn and wish that the past was still present. Reading these stories over, I feel a little of both. Some of the simple energies that made these words flow through my pen--that made the phrases felicitous and the ideas sing--have gone. I lost their maker a long time ago.  These enthusiastic tales are not ashamed of visceral horror, of blood splashing freely across the page: \"The Midnight Meat Train,\" a grisly subway tale that surprises you with one twist after another; \"The Yattering and Jack,\" about a hilarious demon who possesses a Christmas turkey; \"In the Hills, the Cities,\" an unusual example of an original horror premise; \"Dread,\" a harrowing non-supernatural tale about being forced to realize your worst nightmare; \"Jacqueline Ess: Her Will and Testament,\" about a woman who kills men with her mind. Some of the tales are more successful than others, but all are distinguished by strikingly beautiful images of evil and destruction. No horror library is complete without them. --Fiona Webster", "title": "Books of Blood: Volumes One to Three\n      \n          (Books of Blood #1-3)", "url": "http://www.goodreads.com/book/show/32626.Books_of_Blood", "average": 4.17, "cover": "https://images.gr-assets.com/books/1306747123l/32626.jpg", "reviews": 489, "authors": [{"url": "https://www.goodreads.com/author/show/10366.Clive_Barker", "name": "Clive Barker"}], "type": ["Short Stories", "Fiction", "Fantasy", "Anthologies"], "outlinks": ["http://www.goodreads.com/book/show/32626.Books_of_Blood", "http://www.goodreads.com/book/show/1011629.Books_of_Blood_Volumes_1_3", "http://www.goodreads.com/book/show/30300421-libros-de-sangre-vol-menes-i-ii-y-iii", "http://www.goodreads.com/book/show/1167671.Books_of_Blood_I_III", "http://www.goodreads.com/book/show/11538783-books-of-blood", "http://www.goodreads.com/book/show/52635.The_Hellbound_Heart", "http://www.goodreads.com/book/show/32628.The_Great_and_Secret_Show", "http://www.goodreads.com/book/show/32638.The_Thief_of_Always", "http://www.goodreads.com/book/show/768878.Abarat", "http://www.goodreads.com/book/show/52640.Weaveworld", "http://www.goodreads.com/book/show/39928984-mercy-among-the-children", "http://www.goodreads.com/book/show/20620995-take-me-with-you", "http://www.goodreads.com/book/show/6565401-five-quarters-of-the-orange", "http://www.goodreads.com/book/show/25600623-the-diver-s-clothes-lie-empty", "http://www.goodreads.com/book/show/18867378-the-traveler-s-gift", "http://www.goodreads.com/book/show/40198373-big-stone-gap", "http://www.goodreads.com/book/show/40198387-friendship-bread", "http://www.goodreads.com/book/show/40193401-the-little-giant-of-aberdeen-county", "http://www.goodreads.com/book/show/35963775-her-sister-s-shoes", "http://www.goodreads.com/book/show/22617980-the-rock-harbor-collection", "http://www.goodreads.com/book/show/35269080-a-thousand-tomorrows", "http://www.goodreads.com/book/show/40204902-caravans", "http://www.goodreads.com/book/show/31192689-shoeless-joe", "http://www.goodreads.com/book/show/40204877-a-hero-of-france", "http://www.goodreads.com/book/show/6473113-death-in-venice", "http://www.goodreads.com/book/show/40266651-the-tilted-world", "http://www.goodreads.com/book/show/33117501-blonde", "http://www.goodreads.com/book/show/36546758-ever-after", "http://www.goodreads.com/book/show/40193580-rescue", "http://www.goodreads.com/book/show/22032837-the-pearl-that-broke-its-shell", "http://www.goodreads.com/book/show/36589911-the-lords-of-discipline", "http://www.goodreads.com/book/show/11963271-the-sheltering-sky", "http://www.goodreads.com/book/show/25596951-the-dressmaker-s-war", "http://www.goodreads.com/book/show/35120598-gena-finn", "http://www.goodreads.com/book/show/29550710-a-charles-martin-collection", "http://www.goodreads.com/book/show/19977229-remember-tuesday-morning", "http://www.goodreads.com/book/show/8530701-a-town-like-alice", "http://www.goodreads.com/book/show/35414455-the-other-alcott", "http://www.goodreads.com/book/show/18800554-the-scavenger-s-daughters", "http://www.goodreads.com/book/show/40205036-under-the-udala-trees", "http://www.goodreads.com/book/show/32861105-the-streets-have-no-king", "http://www.goodreads.com/book/show/39929534-the-passion", "http://www.goodreads.com/book/show/35654710-this-dark-road-to-mercy", "http://www.goodreads.com/book/show/11513574-breath-eyes-memory", "http://www.goodreads.com/book/show/21942189-the-language-of-hoofbeats", "http://www.goodreads.com/book/show/18165412-house-of-bathory", "http://www.goodreads.com/book/show/37984397-we-own-the-sky", "http://www.goodreads.com/book/show/36004055-not-perfect"]}
