Along the same lines as The Devil Wears Prada, the story follows a youngish Anna-Simone, a vibrant television producer. She is already successful and takes on a new project, the tv show, Sky High. When she meets the infamous Klarissa Maree-Francis, she knows she has met her match and her nemesis. This story is written with a lot of punch, and seriously make you concerned about the mental health of your coworkers. Klarissa will do just about anything to undermine the success of Miriam. It is a fast paced read for sure, full of great moments, some that make you laugh, some that make you shake your head in disbelief. A bit of a salacious read, this novel takes on the bully and ultimately the good and successful person wins in the end. Highly recommend for a light, fun, reading diversion with just enough sass and entertainment factors to keep most readers engaged until the end."}, {"userName": "Cracked Spine", "userReviewDate": "Dec 04, 2017", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/74581846-cracked-spine", "userReview": "Anna-Simone has started a dream new job at a top TV station, but unfortunately it comes with Klarissa, who would be best described as an epic b****. She seems to take delight in putting down all those that work around her, and seems to keep her cruelest scheming for Anna-Simone. As a result Anna-Simone really starts to doubt herself and her abilities. Will she find the strength to stand up to her tormentor.This entertaining, funny and gasp-inducing novel, also has a really important message. There is a real strong anti-bullying theme that is ingrained in the plot. It does give a feeling of empowerment, in that you can and should stand up for yourself if you are being treated unfairly, and you can succeed, no matter how hard the Klarissa in your life, tries to convince you otherwise."}, {"userName": "Joanne Cressy", "userReviewDate": "Dec 07, 2017", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/74700736-joanne-cressy", "userReview": "A poignant, insightful testimony to the devastating impact workplace bullying has on people's lives and mental health. Thank God there are people like Miriam to give a voice to this issue and help others to stand up against it."}, {"userName": "Biblio Phanatic", "userReviewDate": "Nov 30, 2017", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/74432236-biblio-phanatic", "userReview": "This is the perfect novel for fans of the like of The Devil Wears Prada, or for anyone who has had an absolute nightmare of a co-worker, who would throw you under bus at the blink of an eye. Many of us have been in a similar situation that protagonist, Anna-Simone finds herself in \u2013 battling a workplace foe, that seems to want to destroy her for no reason at all. It is shocking the lengths that Klarissa will go to, to undermine and humiliate her co-workers, just to get ahead. Her willingness to betray and bully, makes for a compelling read...it certainly kept me turning page after page, hoping the next one will bring her comeuppance. I don't want to give away any spoilers, but you wont be disappointed by the ending, so fight through your frustrations. Louboutins, Lattes & Live TV by Miriam Sawan is a really fun read, that had be laughing out loud, wanting to tear my hair out, and definitely will make me think twice before sending that brusque email."}, {"userName": "Lillian", "userReviewDate": "Nov 22, 2017", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/74049181-lillian", "userReview": "I was hooked from the first page.

Despite the bullying that was unleashed on the Anna-Simone, she still had empathy for the dragon lady Klarissa. This is a must read for anyone who has been in a work bully situation. More than anything, it gives them the strength and courage to know there is always a light at the end of the tunnel."}, {"userName": "Sherine", "userReviewDate": "Nov 21, 2017", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/9546057-sherine", "userReview": "Having encountered my own version of the villainess in stilettos, this book was not only relatable but therapeutic. Breaking down every thought and action produced by the mind of the narcissistic boss, is so crucially important for the survival of the heroine in this novel. Very well written and strongly recommended for any woman in the workforce."}, {"userName": "Library Love", "userReviewDate": "Dec 12, 2017", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/74893905-library-love", "userReview": "'Louboutins, Lattes & Live TV' by Miriam Sawan, is the epitome of guilty pleasure reading. There is plenty of back-stabbing, heaps of drama, and a bucket load of salacious gossip. This talented author has created a novel that is so well-written, and so readable that I finished it in a single day. T is such a page turner - I just had to know what would happen nextThe story follows Anna-Simone, delighted to land a job at Sky High, a prestigious television network. However, it doesn't take long for the bubble to burst, when her boss Klarissa reveals herself to be ultimate mean girl, a real demon in Louboutins. Klarrissa makes a dream job an absolute nightmare for most of the producers on staff, but Anna-Simone is determined to stand up to her, no matter what it takes. She worked hard for this opportunity and she is not going to let it go without a fight.A real inspiration of a novel, that is the best way to pass the time on a rainy, winter weekend....or to take to the beach on a summer holiday. I highly recommended."}], "description": "Anna-Simone is a savvy television producer, desperate to find her place in lifestyle television.
