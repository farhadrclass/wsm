The show's star was Marnie Davante who was ready to go on with her life by starting a theater for children if she could get the funding but when the lady who had played her mother on the show was murdered right in front of her, everything changed. PI Bryan McFadden had been convinced to go to L.A. and help Marnie by his mother who only he and his two brothers could see since she and their father had been killed while acting in a play. A very interesting storyline and lots of excitement."}, {"userName": "Lorna Broussard", "userReviewDate": "Jun 04, 2018", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/71173938-lorna-broussard", "userReview": "FADE TO BLACK by Heather Graham is a great addition to her Krewe of Hunters series. The paranormal aspects are skillfully woven into the plot. Actress Marnie Davante's world is shattered when a killer focuses on her, and PI Bryan McFadden is drawn into the mystery in this page turner. Graham deftly injects humor with her ghostly characters. FADE TO BLACK is a good read!"}, {"userName": "diana romano", "userReviewDate": "Jun 04, 2018", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/64876146-diana-romano", "userReview": "Order of HuntersThis is another winner. This is my favorite series. I have read all her books since the 80's . Heather Graham writes wonderful storylines and all the people that belong to Adam and his agents are great too. I highly recommend all her books to everyone who love ghosts and those that can see them.

Bryan is a perfect fit. Marnie is a wonderful character and I loved the return to Hollywood or not quite Hollywood but the tv and film industry for this book.

I have immensely enjoyed this series over the years. I began way back when book 1 came out and the books still manage to suck me in and surprise me in the end. Heather does use the same writing formula for this series, they story lines are all pretty similar.

So she\u2019ll work the convention circuit. But then a costar is brazenly murdered in front of her. With a killer who vanishes into thin air with seemingly inhuman skill, and strange events plaguing Marnie, she feels she can\u2019t even trust her own senses. Although his dear departed parents were famous actors, PI Bryan McFadden is about as far from Hollywood as you can get. The former military man is reluctant to get involved in such a bizarre case, but it quickly becomes obvious that Marnie is in grave danger, and he is compelled to help. It\u2019s unclear if the killer is an obsessed fan or something more sinister. Could the show\u2019s cast be cursed? How can Bryan keep Marnie safe when it becomes apparent there\u2019s a force determined to make this her final curtain call?", "title": "Fade to Black\n      \n          (Krewe of Hunters #24)", "url": "http://www.goodreads.com/book/show/36316713-fade-to-black", "average": 4.34, "cover": "https://images.gr-assets.com/books/1517624749l/36316713.jpg", "reviews": 20, "authors": [{"url": "https://www.goodreads.com/author/show/30819.Heather_Graham", "name": "Heather Graham"}], "type": ["Fantasy", "Suspense", "Fantasy", "Fiction", "Romance"], "outlinks": ["http://www.goodreads.com/book/show/36316713-fade-to-black", "http://www.goodreads.com/book/show/37513141-fade-to-black", "http://www.goodreads.com/book/show/36421818-fade-to-black", "http://www.goodreads.com/book/show/38334067-fade-to-black", "http://www.goodreads.com/book/show/36739555-fade-to-black", "http://www.goodreads.com/book/show/575004.Ghost_Walk", "http://www.goodreads.com/book/show/9585036-phantom-evil", "http://www.goodreads.com/book/show/2930659-deadly-night", "http://www.goodreads.com/book/show/10456697-heart-of-evil", "http://www.goodreads.com/book/show/7815689-ghost-shadow", "http://www.goodreads.com/book/show/37581710-the-company-of-demons", "http://www.goodreads.com/book/show/40024832-empire-of-sin", "http://www.goodreads.com/book/show/8343548-the-bricklayer", "http://www.goodreads.com/book/show/40193155-among-the-wicked", "http://www.goodreads.com/book/show/23818400-the-snow-garden", "http://www.goodreads.com/book/show/29420557-breath-of-malice", "http://www.goodreads.com/book/show/29639736-everything-we-keep", "http://www.goodreads.com/book/show/23157833-almost-dead", "http://www.goodreads.com/book/show/33555347-crime-scene", "http://www.goodreads.com/book/show/30249521-fatal-frost", "http://www.goodreads.com/book/show/40266676-remains-of-innocence", "http://www.goodreads.com/book/show/34330657-finding-claire-fletcher", "http://www.goodreads.com/book/show/28824403-outfoxed", "http://www.goodreads.com/book/show/23957469-huntress-moon", "http://www.goodreads.com/book/show/40204087-the-deepest-secret", "http://www.goodreads.com/book/show/35115882-what-the-dead-know", "http://www.goodreads.com/book/show/40267317-ragdoll", "http://www.goodreads.com/book/show/35914878-pretty-dead-girls", "http://www.goodreads.com/book/show/40269681-zeroes", "http://www.goodreads.com/book/show/39791173-the-girl-before", "http://www.goodreads.com/book/show/40205081-last-witness", "http://www.goodreads.com/book/show/40205040-dead-weight", "http://www.goodreads.com/book/show/18903409-weekend-warriors", "http://www.goodreads.com/book/show/34873257-the-lullaby-girl", "http://www.goodreads.com/book/show/40193809-eye-for-an-eye", "http://www.goodreads.com/book/show/35005051-the-forgotten-girls", "http://www.goodreads.com/book/show/27239265-the-short-drop", "http://www.goodreads.com/book/show/40205144-bridged", "http://www.goodreads.com/book/show/17623604-you-only-live-twice", "http://www.goodreads.com/book/show/17377392-thunderball", "http://www.goodreads.com/book/show/17284593-casino-royale", "http://www.goodreads.com/book/show/17623578-for-your-eyes-only", "http://www.goodreads.com/book/show/17304110-live-and-let-die", "http://www.goodreads.com/book/show/18780375-dr-no", "http://www.goodreads.com/book/show/17379070-moonraker", "http://www.goodreads.com/book/show/18799804-diamonds-are-forever", "http://www.goodreads.com/book/show/40205231-the-spy-who-loved-me", "http://www.goodreads.com/book/show/17377384-from-russia-with-love", "http://www.goodreads.com/book/show/40243961-the-cape-refuge-collection"]}
