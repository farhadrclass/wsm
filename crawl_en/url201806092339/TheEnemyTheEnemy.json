Our sense of right and wrong, said Maxie. Just to survive.Just to survive? There\u2019s no just about it. Survival is everything.\u201dHave you ever noticed that big budget everyone-is-pretty-as-all-hell-even-covered-in-blood Hollywood horror movies hardly ever kill kids? The kids escape, live to tell the tale, and walk off into the sunset with their \u201chappily-ever-after\u201d tucked under their arms. Well\u2026.let me say here and now\u2014the same can NOT be said for a Charlie Higson world. The man has no problems slaughtering his characters\u2014his kids. I realize that might sound sick, but hey, I\u2019m talking horror here. haha\u2026 So yeah, I love the man already and this is just book one! :DCome on. Let me introduce you to Charlie Higson\u2019s world! The Enemy pulls readers into a world a year in to a \u201cdisaster\u201d that made every grown up 16 years or older sick, crazed, and diseased. Adults overwhelmed with madness tear through the streets of London with a hunger for blood and flesh. Mothers and fathers turn on their own children. Teachers show students whole new kinds of bloody lessons. Neighbors killing neighbors. So in return, the children must take up arms and defend themselves. Kids killing parents, brothers, sisters, and friends. Brutal, bloody, disgusting battles of survival that will rip your soul to shreds! All over London, groups of armed to the teeth kids have holed up to fight, work, and hopefully survive together. Readers meet two groups of kids banded together in supermarkets faced with hard decisions, low food supplies, and constant attacks from the grown-ups. When news comes down and around about a better place, a safe place with more kids, protection, and food\u2014the kids decide to risk it all and head to Buckingham Palace. Yes, I said Buckingham Palace! Haha\u2026Bloody brilliant, right? As a history geek, Higson is my hero. He has infused history lessons into a zombie tale! Haha\u2026*bows head in awe*The groups of children range from the very small to the older teenagers in charge with life and death decisions of sacrifice and loyalty. Attack, RUN, fire, or die! Fighting the grown-ups is a must to live another day, but when the fighting, power struggle, backstabbing, and manipulation grow within the bands of kids, each one must learn to stand up, pick a side, lead, follow, or question. The kids always assumed the dangers would come from the outside\u2014drooling, sick, mad, grown-ups trying to get in. But what if the enemy is inside, in charge or right beside you? Can trust and loyalty survive the bloodbath and slaughter of this zombie like disaster? Haha\u2026I told myself I would not ramble on, but hell I haven\u2019t even touched on the characters yet. Some of these voices and kids stole my heart right away while others slowly grew on me through the battles and chaos. Several were gone in a blink of an eye while others made me root, cheer and hope to see them lead in the future. So many kids woven together with their own voices, humor, and style. I loved them all! Each one contributed leadership, heart, intelligence, compassion, strength, and ingenuity. All coming to together to form a society. The way the different threads and ingredients twisted together here on the page was amazing! Brilliant! I have to shout love out for a few of my favorites though:Arran\u2014A leader we all hope for in real life. One who pulls everyone together by example, strength, and teamwork. Maxie\u2014The heart of the story for me. Pumping compassion and loyalty into the madness.Oh, Whitney!\u2014haha\u2026.Girl, you are kickass! :D I would hug ya, but I\u2019m willing to bet you would kick my ass!Small Sam\u2014Too cute for words, little man! He tiptoed right into my heart with his tenacity and courage! The Kid\u2014I can\u2019t wait to see what this \u201chalf clever, half stupid, and half crazy\u201d boy has up his sleeve. :) A character I kind of put in the same league as my love and obsession with Dodger from Oliver Twist. A character to keep your eye on at all times!And now to my personal favorite (If I was forced to pick one anyway.) ACHILLEUS! He forged a fierce path through this story with humor, strength, and blood. *shakes head* The boy made a dent in my heart the size of Texas! Hell, they all did!This brutal, no holds barred punch was filled with gruesome and disgusting detail. No illusions. No mercy. No pulled punches. Honest, bloody slaughter-like style that hit me in all the right places! This is their life now. Some kids could let go of the old life, accept, change and survive in the new brutal way of things. Others could not. Sad, bitter, and heartbreaking one minute\u2014hilarious and hopeful the next. This story clawed at my insides in more ways than one\u2026.I am reading book two as we speak, so I\u2019m sure you will hear more of my gushing soon. :)Will the gang survive the royal zombie treatment at the Palace? Hope you dive in and find out!Read it. Charlie Higson\u2019s world is unforgettable."}, {"userName": "Aaron Vincent", "userReviewDate": "Aug 05, 2010", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/2924544-aaron-vincent", "userReview": "Perhaps the most brutal and goriest YA dystopia novel I ever read. It's bloodfest almost every chapter. The novel is jam-packed with things that makes peace-loving bitches wince. Zombie attacks, strong language[There is a line from a character that shocked the hell out of me: \"I didn't like him. He's getting on my tits!\". Fuck Yeah Awesomeness!] cannibalism, and gladiator, everything. It's bloody, dark, violent and best of all, it's pure fun. Definitely not for the faint heart and sensitive stomach[especially the self-righteous douchebags:]. Charlie Higson is a damn brave author. He's nonchalant about killing his characters left and right. He doesn't care if its a major or a minor one. He's a psychopath. He will let you get attached to the character first, then he will kill it. He's like \"You're liking this character, eh? What you would feel if I do this\", then he'll kill that character in a brutal way. Pure wickedness. No one is safe.I highly recommend this to those who loves Michael Grant's GONE novels. Both book shares the same elements such as big casts, in-your-face non-stop actions, kids going against each other, alternating perspectives, fast pacings etc. It's fun literature at its best.It will leave you exhausted but it will also leave you zombie-hungry for more. I'm effin ready for more bloodfest and in-your-face violence. The Dead, bring it on!I dare you to read it!"}, {"userName": "Carol.

I got to hear Charlie speak at the Disney-Hyperion dinner at BEA in New York. He said he tried to make this book as scary as possible, and would read scenes to his son, ratcheting them up until his son had trouble sleeping at night. I figured this must be worth checking out! The best description I can think of: The Enemy is The Lord of the Flies with zombies. It\u2019s set in London after a mysterious sickness has killed off most everyone over the age of sixteen, but left some adults alive as mutated, brainless creatures who want to kill and eat the surviving children. Gruesome enough for you? Bands of children roam the streets looking for food and trying to survive. One such group has created a fortress at a supermarket, but they are out of supplies and the situation looks grim, until a mysterious messenger arrives with an invitation: Come to Buckingham Palace, and you\u2019ll be safe. Is it a dream come true, or a trap? The novel offers tons of nail-biting action. Be aware: children die in this book, sometimes in nasty ways. The violence is not graphically portrayed, but Higson presents a dark, scary future. Different families have different comfort levels about this sort of thing, which is why I mention it, but is The Enemy a page-turner? Absolutely!"}, {"userName": "Priscilla", "userReviewDate": "Mar 31, 2011", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/4731097-priscilla", "userReview": "SO GROSS. And yet so satisfying.

Unless clowns are involved\u2026 and boats\u2026.and, like, those huge Australian bugs that Mandee and Reynje take so much pleasure in sending me pictures of when I\u2019m expecting wallabies and koala bears.OK, actually\u2026. Maybe I am a bit of a wuss.But one thing that struck me about this book was how atmospheric it was. I know I made a similar observation in my review for This is Not a Test, but one of the first scenes (the bit in the swimming pool, for those who have read it!) was like the beginning of a horror film.A group of kids are inside somewhere and it\u2019s quiet. Too quiet. But they\u2019re safe in here. Aren\u2019t they? You get an idea of the individual characters. You have the leader, the cocky one, the cheeky two and the one who keeps looking over his shoulder. Better safe than sorry, right? And they\u2019re all talking and sniping at each other and behaving like boys do. And none of them have noticed that something is wrong. Really wrong.And that\u2019s where I\u2019ll stop.I can\u2019t describe it because I\u2019m not a writer like Mr Higson. I mean, you\u2019ve read my other reviews, right?\u201cHe\u2019d always been scared of the dark. His mum had told him not to worry.\u2018If you can\u2019t see the monsters, they can\u2019t see you.\u2019Back then there had been no monsters. Not real ones. Only imaginary.Now\u2026\u201dSee?*shudders*[FYI: That quote is from my favourite scenes in the book. SO GOOD.]And also, it\u2019s bloody disgusting. It\u2019s really gruesome. We\u2019re talking Yancey\u2019s The Monstrumologist gruesome.\u201cThe skin blackened, shrivelled and split, the overripe flesh inside squeezing out. His insides had turned to mush\u2026 Arran prodded the body with his trainer. As he did so the skin popped, a stream of pus oozed out followed by a bright pink blossom of soft fat.\u201dI mean, that\u2019s disgusting, right? That\u2019s so vile. That\u2019s absolutely horrendous.It\u2019s also AWESOME. And that\u2019s not even the best bit. That comes later and eeerrrrrrgrgrghhhh it\u2019s brilliant.Mr Higson certainly knows how to write a story. The twists and turns were perfectly executed and, even though if you\u2019ve ever read a zombook or a zombie film you may guess some of the twists and turns, it didn\u2019t bother me at all. There were certain scenes and certain things that happened that had me completely thrown. Mr Higson really took the phrase \u2018Kill your darlings\u2019 to a whole new level. Or at least \u2018Kill Jo\u2019s darlings\u2019\u2026 so, yeah, THANKS FOR THE ANGST, CHARLIE HIGSON.I think without Mr Higson\u2019s attention to detail with the characters this could have fallen into the \u2018Oh... a zombie book? Now that\u2019s original!\u2019 trap. I have lots and lots of notes about my favourite characters in this book but seeing as I\u2019ve told you that most of \u2018em turn into Zombie Snacks (similar to Scooby Snacks, by the way, but more\u2026um, living) I\u2019m not going to share my specific thoughts and feelings. I kind of loved every single one of them. Their back stories, their dialogue, their reactions to what was happening around them, how strong they were when\u2026things\u2026.happened. Love love love.But even though I loved a lot of the characters individually, I adored how they worked as a group. They all had their roles to play without it being clich\u00e9 and box-ticky. Yeah we have the smart one and yeah we have the one who wants to go zombie hunting, and the one who isn\u2019t sure what to do but everyone\u2019s looking at for help? Yep, they\u2019re there too. But it felt fresh and exciting and by the time I got to the end, I really felt like I was part of their group.Though, that\u2019s probably wishful thinking because I would want to be part of their group. Because, if/when a zombie apocalypse happens, I\u2019m going to be used for bait. I know this and I\u2019ve accepted this. But maybe if I stuck with the kids in this book I\u2019d last a little bit longer before they dress me in a bright colour and shove me out into the street before locking the door behind me.Anyway\u2026You know that feeling when you read the first book of a series (although, from my understanding, they don\u2019t follow on? Just the same universe, though I may just be telling you vicious lies) and you get all excited and giddy and you look at every grown up thinking they might eat you? I have it with this book and I\u2019m really excited to read more because if that ending is anything to go on, a lot more scary brilliance this way comes.Oh and also; zombie monkeys.What was that? You want me to elaborate?No way.If the phrase \u2018zombie monkeys\u2019 doesn\u2019t make you immediately add this to your reading list, I don\u2019t think anything will.Anyway, I\u2019m gonna have to go because there\u2019s this really creepy bloke just standing outside my house. I mean\u2026 what kind of grown man wears a St George\u2019s flag t-shirt and oh my god, I don\u2019t believe it! He\u2019s just got his friends to come too and\u2026 nope, I\u2019m not having this. Hold that thought\u2026 I\u2019ll be right back.You can read this review and other exciting things on my blog, Wear the Old Coat."}, {"userName": "Lindsey Lynn", "userReviewDate": "Mar 20, 2016", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/31966250-lindsey-lynn", "userReview": "3.5/5 StarsSummary:This book takes place in dystopian London and all adults have succumbed to this disease, making them zombie like.

It did not end well.She gleefully picked up three of the Gone books in a box-set for \u00a310 on her first ever visit to CostCo. She read the first one, was not amused, and the rest have been duly shipped off to the local library collection.Vanessa wrote a review of it (here), but in summation, it was a clever idea that meandered far too much and wound up turning incredibly strange. A child who lost his arm grows back a red tentacle. A girl left starving in the desert for days finds that coyotes can talk and have organised themselves into a society and there's also some entity of darkness controlling them and lurking in a cave. Deus ex severely autistic little brother who can teleport everyone when the going gets tough. Deus ex 'oh my god I have superpowers all of a sudden.' You get the idea.Why is Vanessa making the comparison to Gone? Well, let me explain. Apologies for the abuse of third-person perspective.The Enemy by Charlie Higson solved the main problem I had with Gone. Both stories feature children trying to survive after society goes to hell and leaves them to fend for themselves, and that's where the similarities end. My problem with Gone, however, was that I simply did not care about any of the characters, and it got more than a little batshit and completely lost me in the last 200 pages.The Enemy, however? I was sobbing and nearly chucking my copy of the book across the room when a character died, getting seriously scared whenever anything bad was happening (like poor Small Sam's escape out of a zombie-infested football stadium and from cannibals keeping him prisoner in an abandoned train), and yelling \u201cNo\u201d over and over if somebody had to face the consequences of walking into a trap.You see, very few books do that to me. In fact, the last time I was shrieking and flailing like that at the decisions and outcomes of a character, clucking like a mother hen for a character I really didn't want to see dead or injured in any way... was Patrick Ness' Chaos Walking trilogy. And that's a pretty big acclaim, Mr. Higson. Your crown (which I didn't pilfer from a Burger King children's party, honest!) is on its way in the post.The story of The Enemy follows a group of children, trying to survive in a world where 'grown-ups' \u2013 also referred to as 'Strangers' \u2013 have become zombies. And what horribly, creatively disgusting zombies they were. Boils and pustules all over their sweaty, pungent, feverish skin, burst eyeballs, gormless, hanging jaws with shards of broken teeth sticking out their black gums, the soiled remains of their clothes hanging off them in tatters, etcetera. These zombies also follow the 'smart but still rather bone-brained' bandwagon, by picking rather intelligent hunting tactics. They primarily hunt by scent and tend to kill/capture their victims by outnumbering them, but they tend to take up residence in side-streets, subway tunnels, and even flumes in swimming pools. You can run, but you can't hide. In any case, it adds a lot more danger to regular 'running away from zombies' scenarios.Naturally, the surviving kids have gravitated to supermarkets (because hey, they're giant snack cupboards), but of course, this method doesn't exactly work once you've eaten everything, and there's nothing new coming in. Groups of kids travel to ransack houses and other establishments, but it's still not enough. Our main gang, who all reside in Waitrose, are almost at their wit's end, when all of a sudden they are introduced to Jester. He's a slightly older kid, living in Buckingham Palace with a group of other survivors. He tries to recruit the kids, and they all generally agree to go with him, except for Callum, a natural loner. Another boy from the Waitrose crew named Small Sam, the victim of a recent kidnap, comes back after much hardship to find that everyone has moved to Buckingham Palace. Thus follows a story of a main group traipsing through London, occasionally making detours through the zoo (where they are attacked by zombie chimpanzees, of all things), characters dying because we needed a few more pages here and there, and that less than stellar chapter where the kids go through the main shopping district of London. Conversely, we have Sam, who has to traverse the streets of London all by himself, go through the Tube tunnels, and try not to get eaten by zombies or cannibals along the way.Like I said before, I felt really bad any time something bad happened to these kids. More than a few chapters ended on cliffhangers that had my heart in my mouth, winding up with me feverishly reading ahead to see if my favourite characters would pull through. Which is why I have to deduct half a star for some of the more boring parts of the story, which really felt like padding.You know that romp through London's shopping district I talked about earlier? Yeah. That happens around about when our other characters are going through severe hardship, and then all of a sudden we have kids running riot through Selfridge's, Achilleus had that fight against John for little to no reason... Eh. Just not my kind of thing. (Though I will admit, as clunky as it was, the part where the kids are in Selfridge's and the zombies (who aren't attacking them, just wandering around aimlessly and in a lot of pain) are killed by some kids in gruesome ways was pretty harrowing.)So yes, the story unravels a few times, but that's not too bad. It's doing a lot better than some other books I've read this year in getting me to actually care for the characters. Hell, I was really concerned for the kids even following Jester in the first place. I've read Watership Down. I seriously thought these kids were walking into a trap, and seriously hoped they'd realise David is a slightly watered-down General Woundwort. The lovely dinner once they got there, followed by the other kids' idolisation of David, and the kids slowly breaking up into factions because some of them have bought into David's ideas of a brand new world, and some kids haven't... It was pretty effective. I don't agree one hundred percent about the ending, though, where the kids finally leave Buckingham Palace for the Natural History Museum. There wasn't much conflict, hell, David's guards completely chickened out, and David was reduced to yelling at them to come back from a balcony.The ending with the intelligent zombie in a St. George's football shirt, though? That was pretty amazing, and helped to ensure that I would be buying the next book in this series.My favourite part of the story, bar none, has to be the chapters where Small Sam is running through the subway tunnels, exhausted and just trying to find his way above ground so he can be reunited with the kids from Waitrose. Eventually, he's found by a kindly man named Nick (who, in my mind looks a bit like Argus Filch with dreadlocks \u2013 he even has a fat kitty called Orion \u2013 it's Mrs. Norris!) and his wife, Rachel. They seem nice at first, feeding him up and giving him a bed to sleep on... then he wakes up in an abandoned subway train, chained up and with several other kids, who simply believe Nick and Rachel hold them hostage to keep them safe before letting them go. Of course, Nick and Rachel are cannibals. Nick is pretty damn menacing, especially when he catches Sam and his friend in the act of escaping.This book was pretty much everything I wanted from Michael Grant's Gone. Characters I cared about, hostile situations where you feared for their lives, really creatively horrible zombies, true horror, nice little clues about society here and there, fun little bits of satire... All in all, worth a 4.5/5 in my book.

Except that this time, I adopted a don't-read-before-bed strategy to avoid the nightmares, which was incredibly successful. HURRAH. It's such a fast paced and engaging story, and I was on the edge of my seat for the duration of the book. There are characters you'll hate but can still feel for, and characters you just want to hug, and characters you'll be terrified for. It's gory and violent and creepy and gross, but I just couldn't put it down. And I think I'm going to try and read one of these books a week over the next six weeks to keep the story fresh in my mind. 27/4/2014Holy crap. This is quite possibly the most terrifying book I've ever read, and it's YA. This book gave me nightmares about zombies. Of the wake-up-at-2am-sitting-bolt-upright-in-bed-with-your-heart-pounding variety. The kind where it takes you an hour and 60 pages of a happy adorable squee-worthy book to calm you down enough that you can actually get back to sleep. Admittedly, zombies are my personal squick, but this book is still terrifying. If you're squeamish, this book is not for you. This book is like The Walking Dead meets Lord of the Flies. The zombies ooze and drip various substances (and occasionally burst). Kids get eaten, attacked by dogs, attacked by each other, shot, bitten, held prisoner and are generally living in squalor. And when I say kids, I don't mean teenagers. One character in particular reveals towards the end of the book that he's only nine, which practically ripped my heart out of my chest because OMG NO NINE YEAR OLD SHOULD HAVE TO GO THROUGH ANY OF WHAT HE'S BEEN THROUGH IN THE COURSE OF THIS BOOK. It felt quite similar to Michael Grant's Gone series a lot of the time - a world where anyone older than 15 is gone and where kids are fighting for survival and to find food and water and a sense of stability - but with a better sense of organisation. The older kids look out for the younger ones and try to keep them safe as much as possible. Despite knowing that there's no one to stop them from smoking or drinking, no one seems to be doing so, perhaps because it would lead to increased vulnerability from the grown ups. I wasn't expecting to like this, given that zombies freak me the hell out. And I'm not even sure that I *did* enjoy it - it's a brutal and often terrifying book from start to finish. But it WAS well written, filled with incredible characters, and (I really hate this \"word\" but there's no other way of putting it) unputdownable. Despite my zombie squick, I'm going to keep reading the series because OMG I HAVE TO KNOW WHAT HAPPENS. Warning: do not become attached to anyone. They will probably die.

Characters are killed left and right, and none of the horrible details are left out. It's gory, brutal, slightly gross at times - just how I like it. The writing, guys, is just fantastic! There's nothing \"special\" about it: there's no flowery prose or philosophical quotes to hang on my wall, instead it's fast-paced and drew me in so fast! Higson has this way of writing that makes it feel so  real. One moment I'm with Maxie and her gang, and in the next paragraph I can be a kid seeing grown-ups approach. It just flows so nicely, action after action after bloody gory battlescenes. There's no filtering here. There's no \"he got a wound and died\", oh no no no. Everything is described, every single detail. At times I was so into the book I thought I would get anxiety attacks, because no kid was safe. One moment they were there and then they weren't. It's so intense! The characters had me rooting for them, and even though they could piss me off at times I just really love them all. As I said before, no kid in this story was safe, and every time someone died I would be getting teary-eyed and silently curse that fictional world for being so unfair. There were moments where I felt so happy for them, times when I wanted to hug them or help them kill some zombies, and all in all they were my friends. I miss them already!

He was just so darn cute.2. He is only nine, and he accomplished things that I could never do.3. The chapters from his point of view were my favorite.And since he is nine, I always imagined my little brother Adrien as Sam.Which to me, made it a lot more stressful when Sam was in a tough situation,with you know, getting away from flesh-eating-diseased-parents. And lastly, I loved Blue.Even though he didn't come in until about half-way through the book,I fell in love with him. He was just such great guy,he was really quite, but he kicked some serious zombie butt when needed.So, if super gory details of kids killing grown-ups doesn't bother you,then you MUST (seriously must) read The Enemy.I am actually thinking about reading it again, but I have a pretty large pile in my room of books that I need to read already.But that is the only thing stopping me.I absolutely cannot wait until the second comes out.When I finished The Enemy, I closed the book and said,\"You've got to be freaking kidding me. I need the second one RIGHT NOW!\"And since then I have not been able to think about anything but The Enemy.Just you know what, stop reading this review, and go to the nearest bookstore,and buy The Enemy. The rest of my review doesn't even matter anymore. You got the point that it's amazing, so that's all you need to know.

I read all the series that was out at the time, and then I had ..... \nTHE READING SLUMP\u2122\n. So I lost track of the series and now four or so years on I was like, hmmm, maybe I should check those books out againTwo things strike me about thse books: 1:THEY ARE SCARY AS FUCK !!! JFC !! 2: They're not /as good/ as I remember. But still pretty good. Basically, it's about a group of kids living in a supermarket at the end of the world. All the adults have become diseased and ... started ... eating the kids !! and it's hectic. THINGS I LIKE ABOUT THIS: \u2192 fucking terrifying. These books are so, so gory and awful. You got kids getting eatin all over the place, you got kids fighting eachother. You got cannibalism, you got psycho monkeys, you got disease and death and blergh just about everything other thing you can think of. I mean these books are brutal, you think your fave is safe because they're a \"\"main character\"\" but oooohh no. Charlie Higson definitely understands the concept of \"kill your darlings\" && Aside from the fact it's gory, the actual \"\"zombies\"\" themselves are INSANE These are not just lumbering critters who you might run into, ooh no. These bad boys are INTELLIGENT. THEY !! LITERALLY !! MAKE !! PLANS !! AND !! AMBUSH !! KIDS !! AND !! THEY !! ARE !! SO !! SCARY !!.  Not to mention some of it is told in the POV of a zombie, shudders They make the Walking Dead zombies look like fluffy little bunnies. Like, these books are scary as all hell I am worried about Past Me \u2192 Worldbuilding. Because, I know what you're thinking. Another zombie book? Another kids alone without adults book!? yeah, yeah I get you fam but listen these bring something new to the table. First of all, they're set in London. And along with the setting comes the general annoying propriety that is associated with Brits. You got kids from posh boarding schools, Kings and Queens, and it's full of British slang. It was a new twist to the tired, typical American setting and I liked it. (plus, the \"hideouts\" of the kids are something else, since this is London, hub of ridiculous and over the top architecture - the hideouts are  real neat I mean, they're hiding out in Buckingham Palace its amazing. ( So on a side note, how come Rick & Co from the walking dead haven't tried to shelter from zombies in the white house !?!) But aside from that, the development of the kids, the different groups and cultures that have sprung up in these groups is good worldbuilding. Each different group of kids has it's own customs, traditions, languages and while they're not /too different/ they all still have their quirks and its just interesting. The expansion of the world just in one book was great.  \u2192 ACTION. So much action, on every page. These are quick books because they're so fast paced and the pace never lets up. Something is going down on every single page and it's great. THINGS I DIDN'T LIKE AS MUCH: \u2192 Yeah, the characters. Just a bit of a letdown. They're not awful, not by any means. These characters pass, but they're nothing special. I don't feel any of them are particularly complex or well developed. They exist to propel the story but I just wanted MORE. I wanted more from them, I wanted more about how the apocalypse if effecting them, how they feel, what they stand for. Don't get me wrong because we do get it, I just wanted much MORE to really develop them. And on another note with characters, I wanted to mention diversity because I felt, for a book written in 2010 when diversity wasn't so much of a big deal it's pretty good. I would have liked to see more anD I COMPLETELY FORGOT FROM THE FIRST TIME I READ IT THAT AKKIE KISSES JOHN AND I THINK IT WAS A /JOKE/ AND HE WAS JUST ESTABLISHING HIMSELF AND I DON'T REMEMBER IT BEING A THING LATER ON BUT I WISH IT WAS BECAUSE WHEN HE DID THAT I WAS LIKE ?!?! #GiveAchilleusABoyfriend \u2192 Representation of women. I just, eh eh eh. I don't wanna say too much about it but it was a bit disappointing that there are very very female characters in this and the ones that are there are often given the \"mothering\" role and while Maxie is the leader of the Waitrose kids by the end, no one really respects her and I just eh eh eh. It was okay, but it was kinda off too. \u2666\u2666\u2666\u2666\u2666\u2666\u2666\u2666\u2666\u2666\u2666\u2666\u2666Anyway, overrall I'd give this a 3.5 I think these books are genuinely terrifying, and a great addition to a genre thats overcrowded, especially in recent years with the rise in popularity of The Walking Dead. Regardless, I'm glad I reread this and while it wasn't as great as I remembered, it was still pretty good."}, {"userName": "Wendy Darling", "userReviewDate": "May 22, 2011", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/2745288-wendy-darling", "userReview": "3.5 starsI've been meaning to try out this series for a long time, and I'm glad I started! It's an interesting story that keeps you engaged, and features terrific action sequences. I especially liked how the gore was handled--squicky, but not too over the top. The author isn't afraid to kill of characters you've gotten attached to, and they aren't telegraphed too far ahead of time, either.What prevents this from being rounded up for me is that those deaths, while piquing my interest, never moved me as much as they should have--and that's indicative of the lack of emotional investment I felt for the characters. There's a big cast of them in this selective omniscient third party POV, and while their stories are handled well for the most part, they're intriguing without being truly engaging...so the stakes never really feel that high, even when there are dangerous things going on. The pacing also felt a little off to me, and the dialogue is serviceable, but not much more than that.I give it points for the creepy couple, though, as well as logical and engrossing progressions in plot. I also liked Small Sam's story, and Callum's, and I'm interested in seeing what becomes of Maxie and Blue. Definitely continuing on with the series, as the story kept me interested, surprised me every once in awhile, and I'm curious how the author sustains this for seven books.

The zombie apocalypse came about due to a disease that only affected the adults who slowly deteriorated into mindless flesh-eating zombies. The main group of survivors have holed up in a supermarket, so when another group comes and offers them refuge at Buckingham Palace, they begin the dangerous trek across the city in hopes of finding sanctuary.I plowed through this 448 page novel in two days - it's that fast-paced and addicting. I didn't want to stop turning the pages. While thrilling and a good take on zombies, the storyline felt a little too familiar and it was difficult for me to fully connect with anyone from the cast. However, the last hundred pages or so took everything up and even and made me bump my rating up to a full four stars. If you're a fan of The Walking Dead, you may like to begin this series opener.

Obviously I never read it for that, and I don't think I would have unearthed this now if I didn't choose to read it for this month.Besides, a borrowed book on my shelf for a year feels wrong.In \nThe Enemy\n, all people aged sixteen and above have succumbed to a disease that turns them into flesh-eating monsters. Only the children are left and several have made it into some safehouses, banding together using their own abilities to survive in a bleak world. One of these groups of kids were the Waitrose kids, led by Arran and Maxie, who has lived in an abandoned grocery in the last few months. Food and resources are scarce, and the kids are already losing hope. Until one day, a kid in a colorful coat comes and invites them to join him to Buckingham Palace, where another group of kids are living and are successful in creating a new life for themselves. The kids decided to go with him, but will their lives really change for the better once they get to the palace?\nThe Enemy\n starts of with action and doesn't really leave that kind of mode until the end. Which is good, because it kept me on my toes and had me biting my fingernails for whatever else could happen to these kids. Other people warned me not to get attached to any of the characters in the book because the author kills them -- and it is true. Boy how true is that. This makes for a very gripping read because you just never know who would die and how, and you never know who are the bad guys really are.I also really liked Small Sam's story -- I think I was rooting for him the most! I like how his story paralleled the others, and where he got to. The subway (or to be appropriate, the tube) scene in the dark reminded me of a similar scene in \nThe Dark and Hollow Places\n, and it truly got me worried for him and how he would get out of it. There's also a hint of cannibalism in the story and I have to admit that it got my stomach churning uncomfortably there.With all these positive things, though, I have to admit that I wasn't that invested in the story. That, and I was partly grossed out for some reason. Maybe I've turned soft and my stomach isn't as adept as handling zombie gore anymore. There were several times I felt like gagging while reading the book, and I couldn't handle reading it while eating. With that, I didn't really feel like I was glued to the pages. True, the story had all sorts of action and it made me fear for the characters, but my overall feeling in the end was, \"Okay, finally that was done.\" I only really wanted to see how it ended, but I didn't care that much as compared to the other zombie novels I read and loved. My friends who have read this all sang praises to this...but I'm afraid I'm more on the lukewarm side.Now that I think about it...maybe I have turned soft. :ONevertheless, \nThe Enemy\n is still one of the better written zombie novels out there, and it's a good read especially for those who like more gore than the usual. If you want to read a book about survival, a bit of politics and the undead, then his Higson book is for you. What's more: its sequel, \nThe Dead\n, is already out so you won't have to wait too long to know what Charlie Higson had in mind when he thought of a post-apocalyptic world."}, {"userName": "Elena", "userReviewDate": "May 20, 2011", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/3701038-elena", "userReview": "[The two things that bothered me the most: 1) How the hell does darkness/subterraneanness prevent zombification?

Oh wow. Oh wow.There is no way of hiding it. I've been in a major reading slump considering the last I time I finished a book, the Sun was still visible at 8 PM. With a little push from my friends, like Mama Bird pushing her babies off the tree so they can learn to fly, I picked up this book. Screw Red Bull,  this book gives you wings. I loved how intense this book was. BAM. Zombies from left. BAM. Zombies on your right. There was never a moment to calm your heart rate before something exciting happened. Since for the majority of the book, the story was told in two perspective, Maxie and Small Sam, it ensured the readers of getting two very different perspective of post-zombie-apocalypse-London. I loved that. It is like A Game of Thrones with Jon on the Wall, offering us a different perspective, a completely separate adventure. I think that's why I enjoyed Small Sam's story the most. His growth from a boy who wet himself to \"The Giant Killer\" was sensational. His courage and determination kept me wanting more.Oh and let's not forget about the other kids. Maxie, Ollie, Freak, Blue, Arran. I am beginning to think, the weirder their names, the cooler they are. Every one of them had their own distinctive personality so even when there are over 20 kids to keep track of, I felt like I got to know everyone. But that is not to say they were paper cut-outs. Charlie Higson did not write them as \"Oh, let him be a nerd, and let's make this kid the Great Leader, and I'll just add in a badass fighter who take shit from no one.\" Because, secretly, like Small Sam, everyone was a nerd, a leader and a fighter. As you read on, you'll see that and begin to feel for every single one of the kids. Because, honestly, they all ultimately want to survive.Also, I couldn't stop drawing parallels between Michael Grant's GONE series to this one. It was as if The Walking Dead and the GONE series had a love child. It had the multiple perspective that I loved from GONE, the badassness I adored from TWD, the struggle for power GONE does so well and lastly, it had the zombies.I cannot wait to read on in this series. I love how cunning these kids are. How they are the underdogs, the losers, the leaders, the quiet-and-listen type, but at the same time, they are the hot-heads who doesn't give any effs. I'm just going to leave it here. I need calm down before I pass out.

I picked up this book for the traveling book project Germany, which always adds a lot of fun to the reading experience due to the comments throughout the book.\"The Enemy\" is set in a dystopian world where everyone over the age of 14 has fallen ill and behaves like some kind of zombie. We follow a group of kinds in the heart of London who are trying to stay alive and roam the surrounding area for food and other supplies. But this area is roamed constantly by the so called \"grown-ups\" and its getting more and more dangerous to survive.What I really liked, and that's sounds rather morbid, is Higson's courage to spare nobody. If you are looking for a light fluffy read with some funny behaving adults you will be disappointed. It's kind of like Game of Thrones in that regard because Higson isn't afraid to kill off characters you grow really attached to.The plot was most of the time very interesting and there were constantly new threats for our cast of characters that kept the story always interesting and the outcome uncertain. Sadly, the second half of the book wasn't as interesting as the first for me and the antagonist felt a bit flat and not fleshed out enough. Despite being written for a younger audience, the book is quite graphic. But this just made the atmosphere even creapier and genuinely dangerous in my opinion.

I was expecting to like it but I didn't realise how much I did until like halfway through. The plot is strong, the pacing is frantic, and the body count is so damn high! It's called The Enemy for a good reason - there are so many enemies! There are the obvious zombie adults who want to eat the kids (we've all been that hungry before, right! No? Awkward...) but there are also some enemies that you don't expect as much. This means you literally should trust no one.Like I said, the body count is high. A lot of people died that I wasn't expecting to die at all. That's one of the points I realised I was so into this book. Someone died unexpectedly and I was left like \"Oh sh*t no way?!\", not realising I'd become so attached to the characters. Obviously with the death count, there is a significant amount of blood and gore - so be warned. I don't think it's as graphic as it could've been, but there are a few scenes where you're left feeling a bit ew.Now you're probably thinking \"it sounds like you loved this book, why'd you only give it 4 stars?\" Well while I did really enjoy it, I had a couple of issues. A minor one was the lack of background about the illness which turned the adults into zombies. I wasn't too bothered by this though as I acknowledge they are just kids and probably don't have an in depth explanation to give. I've also been assured that you get this in later books.One of the things I found to be confusing at first was the rapidly changing POVs. I'm fine with multiple perspectives - I actually enjoy it - but this book had no discernible breaks when switching POVs. It would often just switch from paragraph to paragraph with no gap or anything. I just like to know whose head I am in when reading. You do get used to it after a while though.The last thing is that maybe there are too many characters. In the first 2 chapters alone (only 14 pages) you are introduced to 9 characters straight away. The group is also about 45 to 55 kids and while you obviously don't learn all their names, you do learn a good few of them. With such a large group there'd be times when I couldn't remember which character they were referring to.Overall though I definitely enjoyed my time reading this and I can't wait for more suspenseful adventures in the future :)"}], "description": "In the wake of a devastating disease, everyone sixteen and older is either dead or a decomposing, brainless creature with a ravenous appetite for flesh.
