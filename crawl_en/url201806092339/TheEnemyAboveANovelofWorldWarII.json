This book is about a jewish boys time surviving from the Nazis. I didn't like the way this book was written. It flowed awfully, and wasn't even a good story. The book lacked a good climax, and was rather boring. I can't even find anything good about it. This book was actually written for 4th grade reading level so thats probably the reason I found it so bad."}, {"userName": "Ms. Yingling", "userReviewDate": "May 30, 2016", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/2636606-ms-yingling", "userReview": "ARC from Young Adult Books CentralAnton's life in the Ukraine has been difficult. His mother died when he was young, and his father went off to fight in WWII and has not been heard from for a very long time. He has a supportive uncle, however, as well as his grandmother, Bubbe. When his village is overrun by the Nazis, a small group of people manage to escape, but they are found by Major Von Duesen, who is taking his directive to make the area free of Jews very seriously. Bubbe is angry and lets Von Duesen know, which gives Anton time to escape, although Bubbe is taken into custody so she can be questioned later, and two neighbors are shot to death. Anton is bound and determined to get Bubbe back, since she is all he has left. He manages to sabotage the truck she is on and free her, and they make their way to a cave where they set up a community and try to survive by stealing food from local farms. Von Duesen is angry that his career was ruined by Bubbe's group, and vows to find them and bring them to justice, especially since the war is not going well for the Nazis. How will Anton and his friends and family be able to survive until the Americans come and the Nazis retreat? There are never enough books about the Jewish experience in the Holocaust, and this is an interesting change from books where people are sent to camps. The details of escaping, living in the cave, and foraging for food are all vivid and helpful in understanding another facet of the Jewish experience. That this book is set in the Ukraine was also interesting, especially since Bubbe knew some German since the Ukraine had been so unsettled for so many years. Anton is motivated by survival, and also by helping to keep his family alive, and his efforts to do this are well described. It is Von Duesen, however, who is an interesting character study. While there had to have been many Germans who treated the Jews in horrific ways, there were probably a larger number who did what they were told to do lest they suffer themselves. Von Duesen is between these two types of people-- he's irritated by the Jews enough to commit atrocities, but the core of his motivation seems to be his own success. Therefore, when the Jews escape, he is more concerned that it will look bad for him with his superior officers than with the fact that there are Jews who escaped. I hadn't really thought about people who lingered in that area of self-absorbed cruelty. Kathryn Lasky's portrayal of Leni Riefenstahl in The Extra would be the closest book I can think of that has such a character. Fans of Dan Smith's WWII books, Will Osborne's Hitler's Secret, or even Hoose's nonfiction book, The Boys Who Challenged Hitler: Knud Pedersen and the Churchill Club will find the portrayal of Anton's struggle against the Nazis to be an excellent addition to the body of books about the Holocaust."}, {"userName": "Dakota Bush", "userReviewDate": "Mar 08, 2017", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/61190102-dakota-bush", "userReview": "The Enemy Above by Michael p.

HE saves his grandma (bubbe)but the other die. They move into new cave after waling for miles.I like war books so when i saw this and had to get it. I liked the way they used caves as a hiding place in this like the priests grotto. I dislike how they just begun them going to the cave right away. I also dislike how they switch from the Jews hiding to the Nazi guard trying to find them.In my opinion i liked the book and recommends it to anyone and i liked it because i like war books and i like how they are living in a cave for almost a year and still manage to not get caught until the end.

The main character's name is Anton and he lives with his two uncles and his grandmother. Anton is a twelve year old boy that is very obeying and respectful.They were living a decent life until the Gestapo raided their village and they had to move to a cave far away which was a jewish hideout. Even though they planed for all of it Anton\u2019s uncle ended up getting captured.So Anton and his are in the cave now but they have had close encounters with the Gestapo trying to get water. So Anton\u2019s uncle Dimitri sends Anton and his friend into the cave system to find a way out if they get raided, so he does that and he ended finding a way out but he gets crushed by rocks. Then we get a little bit further in the story and the Gestapo raid their camp and they capture him, a lady with her child, and his grandmother. I guess you will have to read the book to find out the rest.This was a great book and it was definitely one of my favorites. The book was the perfect length and it had a great storyline and great characters. The book was so good that you wouldn\u2019t believe that it was Realistic-Fiction. My favorite part of the book would have to be when Anton went into the cave to find an exit out of the cave if they were ever raided. The authors style of writing is amazing, Michael Spradlin is a great writer and is very talented.I would recommend this book to anybody who would like the history on the holocaust. I would recommend this to a student and a teacher because it is such a good book. I would rate this book a five star rating. I would do that because it gives so much information on what actually happened during the holocaust and what the jewish had to go through. I loved this book and hope there are more like this to come."}, {"userName": "Hunter", "userReviewDate": "Oct 12, 2017", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/70748041-hunter", "userReview": "I think that this is the best book that I ever read before. I don't hear me say that even about a magazine about hunting or fishing, that's how much I liked this book. This book is about a twelve year old boy during WWII. He has to go through many struggles, but I think the biggest struggle was when he had to attack the Gestapo with rocks. He managed to hit the captain in the head and escape with his grandmother and a mother and her child. My favorite part of this book was when he was in the cave searching for water and a way out. The reason why that is my favorite part is because I thought it was funny that he pulled the one rock and all the others came falling down."}, {"userName": "JacobS", "userReviewDate": "Nov 22, 2016", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/58982408-jacobs", "userReview": "This novel is about a Jewish kid named Anton getting stuck in the middle of the world war 2 and him trying to keep safe after he had to leave his house due to the fighting so close by. They hide in tunnels underground that are very well hidden that the Nazis will never find them but then, one day they get attacked with smoke bombs. That is when Anton decides that he is the man of the family and saves his grandmother and get separated and try and find their way back to their family.A lesson I learned from this is to think before do. It showed this several times in this book. Like when Anton's grandmother he calls \"bubbe\" got captured by the Nazis and he risked his life without thinking to get her back. Another time when someone risked their life and not even thinking about it was when his uncle decides to join the army to fight the Nazis. The last one I will share about the theme is when Anton came running in to try and save his grandma from getting captured again his grandma ended up getting shot because of him.I would recommend this book but not that urgently because I thought it was good but I wouldn't give it a five or four star because in the book I thought barely anything really happens throughout the hundred pages that could have been something action packed. I did like it though because it was a story of two people one, a Jewish kid and the other, a Major on the Nazi side but I didn't find the Major's story quite as important as Anton's."}, {"userName": "Colin", "userReviewDate": "Feb 14, 2017", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/60658343-colin", "userReview": "I liked this book.

I know if that was my fear, I wouldn't want to be a character in the Realistic Fiction novel \u00a8The Enemy Above\u00a8 By Michael P. Spradlin, a book told from the perspectives of a young Jewish child, named Anton, and the gestapo officer trying to hunt Anton's family (and many other families) hiding spot down. I enjoyed this book because it had this sense of mature thinking, and it lead me to learn more about the Eastern Front of WW2.\tFirstly, I enjoyed this book for the sense of growing more mature and more able in Anton's perspective. Throughout the novel, Anton has multiple points where he can outwit even the cunning Gestapo Officer to evade capture. The book throughout shows Anton's grandmother seeing him as more of a man than before the Germans arrived. However, throughout the book, there is also a more sinister perspective, through the Gestapo Officer, who is extremely intelligent, yet he is evaded time and time again. For his failures, he is demoted throughout the book, and I believe that this may have made all the Germans seem like idiots who are only focused on one thing, to the point they can't think about doing anything else.\tSecondly, This novel lead me to learn more about the Eastern Front of WW2. This is because of a single note, given to the Gestapo officer by his brother, who had fought in Stalingrad. In the letter, he states, \u00a8... We are near defeat. The Russians will not give up... Not even the mighty Luftwaffe has been able to break the Russian spirit... Russian Infantry officers are shooting anyone who attempts to retreat on the spot. How can such a people be defeated? ... Our tanks are out of fuel, our planes will not fly in the cold.\u00a8 (pg:125) For me, the line that talks about the Russian infantry officers sticks out the most. I mean, that is insane! When I read this, I thought it to be impossible. Then I thought about something I'd heard. Under Joseph Stalin's leadership, almost 11,000,000 Soldiers had died in the Eastern Front of WW2. At this, I realized it was most likely true, and then I wanted to dig more into this terrible side of the war. I wanted to see just how much each soldier went up against daily, see how past events might've made a difference, and line up the advantages and disadvantages each side faced in the bigger picture. I wanted to understand what each side had, and what they would need to survive a long, drawn-out battle.\tIn conclusion, I would recommend this book to anyone who wants to know a little more about daily life for the Jewish people who decided to hide away, or to those who enjoy suspenseful books, because it has much of both. I enjoyed for the feeling of growing older both in the mind and in the soul, and it lead me to learn more about the Eastern Front of WW2."}, {"userName": "Anthony C", "userReviewDate": "Dec 15, 2016", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/59564497-anthony-c", "userReview": "THE ENEMY ABOVE is a really great book because its about this child, a grandmother, and the nazis. At first it starts off with Anton and his grandmother in the house then Anton sees a explosion in the distance at first he thought it was a lightning bolt, but then he realized that it is a bomb and he told his grandmother that he saw it then when she relized that the nazis are here so then she told Anton that they had to get out of here. So Anton grabbed some stuff from the house then they got in the car and started driving off. The next night they were walking through a field of wheat when they heard the nazis coming that's when Antons grandmother said that they had to burry themselves with dirt, so they did that and then the nazis started walking through the field then the nazis walked right past the and Anton felt so scared that he might run, but he didn't. In 10 days they met up with more jews and they had a home underground so that they could stay there a while then in 5 more days the nazis found there hiding spot and captured three of them. Then Anton went and rescued them and the other two went a separate way they got shot by the nazis, but anton and his grandmother went to a barn and stayed there over night then in the morning they started walking toward THE PREISTS GROTTO they got there in 20 days then they stayed there for a while it was also huge on the inside. It was Christmas then and Anton was thankful that he was still alive with everybody. Anton figured out that the Americans were pushing back the gestapo, and that night they had a selibratory dinner. What i liked about this book is that it was mostly adventuris. What i disliked about this book is that it was super long.This book made me feel adventuris.If you like adventure books then this is the one for you.This book is related to ENEMY PLANES ABOVE US, and EGO IS THE ENEMY."}, {"userName": "Caden", "userReviewDate": "May 19, 2017", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/67870206-caden", "userReview": "The Nazis were closing in on Anton and his family, and they had nowhere to go. This happened to Anton many times. The book I read for my genre exploration is The Enemy Above by Michael Spardlin. Anton was a young Jew teen who was living in the time of the Holocaust, his mother had died when he was young. His father had gone off to fight for the Ukrainian army, he was now living with his grandma which he called Bubbe. The Nazis were coming their way and now they had to flee their home to the underground village where other Jews were hiding. They did not know if they would be discovered or if someone had given away their location, Anton had to learn not to trust anyone.The Enemy Above is a great example of a historical fiction novel. This is because I know that a historical fiction novel always is set in the past or is revolved around a topic that happened in the past. In The Enemy Above the topic in the past is the Holocaust. Another example in Chains by Lauris Halse Anderson it states \u201cto be made slaves for life in a Christian land.\u201d We know that slavery is not legal today so this must be in the past. For one example in Chains it says that \u201cMost of Madams friends have a slave to split wood.\u201d Again , this talks about slavery so this would be in the past. So that is how I know that The Enemy Above is a historical fiction novel. Another example in Let America be America Again by Langston Hughes is \u201cslavery\u2019s scars.\u201d This again talks about slavery which we all know is illegal so it has to be in the past. I enjoyed the book because I like learning about historical topics. I think teenagers would like this book it would not be for little kids because of the content and the topic of the book. So if you are looking to read a story about the Holocaust, I think that The Enemy Above is a good choice for you."}, {"userName": "Josh", "userReviewDate": "Jul 12, 2017", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/1314107-josh", "userReview": "Let's get my complaint about this book out of the way first. I have read other books by Spradlin, but this one drove me absolutely bonkers for one simple reason. The author started way too many sentences with \"and.\" It's not like he does it once or twice a page, but almost every other paragraph contains at least two sentences written this way. What makes it even worse is that these little \"sentences\" are not great pieces of writing. As an elementary school teacher, I am constantly trying to get my students not to start a sentence with the word \"and.\" There is no way I am going to place this book on my classroom bookshelves, because it's doing exactly what I am teaching my students not to do.Now on to the story itself. It's nice to see authors tackling the subject of the Holocaust and doing so without prettying it up. Spradlin doesn't shy away from the violence and death associated with this horrible period in history. In fact, I think it might be a little too much for younger readers who are sensitive or not ready for this subject matter. I probably would recommend this book for 6th graders and higher, maybe mature 5th graders.The story follows a Jewish boy, Anton, and his grandmother as they try to hide from the invading Nazis and a Major bent on revenge. The majority of this book takes place over what is maybe a week. Each chapter switches between the boy and the major, each time filling in more details and providing more insights into each character. Overall, the book isn't bad. It's interesting, sad, and tense. I just wish it had been written better."}, {"userName": "Joshua Chandler", "userReviewDate": "Dec 13, 2017", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/71363320-joshua-chandler", "userReview": "The book The Enemy Above by Michael P.

Then later on Anton finds the place where all jewish people could hide and he finds the rest of his family there. I honestly think the book was great. It was one of the best book is one of the best books I ever read. The one thing I would put in the book is what all the German words in the book meant at the end. I had a hard time understanding hat they all meant. I could infer what they meant but I didn't understand what all of it meant. Other than that the book was really great. I think that anyone from middle school and up or any body that is into history would love this book. I think they would like it because it showed how the jewish people would hide from the Nazis. Also it can make you feel what they went through.

The author makes the story very realistic by adding it death/abuse scenes, which makes you keep reading to find out what happens. Overall it was a very good book, with very good description and detail."}, {"userName": "Sarah Morgan", "userReviewDate": "Jun 05, 2018", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/4787519-sarah-morgan", "userReview": "Hard to read this story from the Nazi perspective. Pulled no punches & gave that character no facets. It\u2019s very hard to read things like \u201c Jews are no better than animals\u201d and \u201clittle Jewish pig\u201d aloud to my kid. Better read aloud & discussed than read to himself & simply digested. This could have been done with more finesse. Disappointed in Scholastic."}, {"userName": "Amanda", "userReviewDate": "Jun 20, 2017", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/8689976-amanda", "userReview": "This book is a fast read for fluent readers and would be easy enough for most readers that struggle. It takes place in Ukraine. The main character is 12 years old. This book address the Nazi goal of eliminating the Jewish population. While it definitely involves heavy issues of death, loss, murder, and genocide, it is appropriate for younger readers without being overly graphic."}], "description": "Nazi gun fire can only mean one thing...The Germans are closing in.
