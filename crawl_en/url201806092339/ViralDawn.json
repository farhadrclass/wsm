Although, nothing new has been introduced into the zombie mythos, Ms. Logsdon has succeeded in merging just about every traditional zombie aspect that I have encountered, either through literature or film. However, this fact does not take away from the reading experience, but instead enhances it. The main character, Casey, is a strong female lead, supported by a well developed cast of characters. Casey finds herself thrust into a world of flesh eating zombies that tend to only come out at night. However, there are a few subtle hints in the story that there is simply more to them than that. Perhaps they are evolving? If you wish to know more, I suggest you read the book.The work is well written and flows at a nice pace, with a few slow parts that seem to coincide with what Casey is experiencing and feeling. I would have liked a little more action in the story, but it is enough to get you through, connected with bouts of drama and intelligent dialogue. For a zombie novel, the blood and gore are kept to a tasteful level, just right.The end of the story leaves the reader with a heavy cliff hanger, keeping you wanting more. I would most definitely be interested in experiencing more of the world in which Viral Dawn takes place and would recommend this book to the average young adult reader and older audiences."}, {"userName": "Amanda", "userReviewDate": "Jan 22, 2013", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/9382342-amanda", "userReview": "Very Very short.

It is too short. Just as we have been getting things developed in the characters, the locations, the relationships, the author cuts off the story. Much like a Saturday Matinee... See you next week!! Uggg...The story is basic Zombie Outbreak with introductions to the main characters, the history of the area and what is happening now. Add a few standard plot devices and viola, instant story. Now, this isn't to say it's like all the others, there is enough to make it fresh and worth the time to read. I am sure to pick up any and all books in the series as they become published. All in all, a great ride, not too much gore, a touch of romance here and there, oh, and Zombies."}], "description": "Librarian's note: Alternate cover edition of ASIN B0099YS2AI.An explosion at the army depot unleashes a deadly cloud carrying a genetically engineered virus that turns people into flesh-eating zombies.
