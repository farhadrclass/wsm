It's chock full of interesting deaths and fascinating details on the science of the human body.I was gripped from the first page as Dr. Melinek begins her journey of training to be a medical examiner in New York City, 2001. She obviously found time (who knows how?!?!) to record in her daily journal for two years. Little did she realize she was about to play a crucial part as one of the investigators in America's greatest human tragedy. As a new trainee, she was thrown into 9/11 to sift through semi-truck trailers full of body parts, jet fuel and ash. She relates this horrific experience with humbleness and gratitude for the first responders. It is a sobering, deeply touching account for the reader. The 9/11 section is basically only one chapter of this terrific book. Mostly, the author relays the various stupid things humans do to themselves and each other that cause death. She has strong opinions against suicide (her own father hung himself when she was 13) and I found her candor on the subject profound and endearing. She never comes across as preachy.If you have the stomach for forensic science, I think you will love this book as much as I did. Truly one of the most compelling books I've read in awhile!"}, {"userName": "Matt", "userReviewDate": "Apr 27, 2018", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/5903843-matt", "userReview": "While the world of medicine is likely beyond the comprehension of many, there is always an interest in some of the more bizarre cases that make their way onto the public\u2019s radar. These types of medical situations are anomalies, according to Dr. Judy Melinek, MD and TJ Mitchell, citing that the vast majority of medical cases are not worthy of a script on prime time television. After leaving her surgical residency, Melinek leapt at the chance to enrol in one focussed on pathology, with significant interest in the forensic arm of the field. This led to a two-year fellowship in the Office of the Chief Medical Examiner in New York, where Melinek was able to see some of her most exciting and interesting cases, described throughout the book. While many think of a medical examiner as being one who deals in homicides, Melinek explains that there are many types of life-ending situations that ended up before her. Some were quite serious, including the man who leapt five storeys to his death and fractured numerous bones, while others were overly comical, like the man who died from complications with his metal penile implant. Not only does the job require an examination of the body to determine the matter of death, but can be quite contentious if the family disagrees or the matter makes its way to court. Melinek explains that her job can be quite stressful, especially as the body is not always forthcoming with evidence of what has happened and witnesses can inject their own bias surrounding the events leading to the end of life. Melinek may have a humours side, but her work also subjects her to numerous cases of horrible death or suffering, not the least of which was the fallout of the September 11, 2001 disaster, where she and her team (alongside many others) were tasked with identifying remains and trying to bring closure for many. Full of oddities that many readers will likely feel must be real\u2014as this stuff could never be made up\u2014the book will education as well as entertain the curious reader. Perfect for those who have an affinity for all things medical and enjoy some of the funnier predicaments in which people can find themselves at the point of death. A lighter read for those who want to absorb rather than construct strong opinions. Melinek and Mitchell have created an interesting piece here, serving to dispel the myths of television dramatization of the former\u2019s job as well as presenting some of the more interesting parts of work as a medical examiner. The authors do a masterful job of explaining the medical nuances of the work and injecting a less than intensely serious aspect, which can sometimes help to make the vignettes more alluring. At no time should the reader feel that the profession is anything but serious, though there are so many interesting files that must cross the desk of a medical examiner that they are forced to find some of the lighter sides to get through the day. I can only suspect that many of the names (and some facts) have been fudged, as the authors freely offer names and situations to help the reader feel as though they are in the middle of the situation at hand. Told in a straightforward manner with some medical jargon (which is fully explained), the reader is given a decent dose of the profession without drowning in the minutiae. Melinek and Mitchell divide the book\u2019s chapter\u2019s up to discuss a specific theme and choose a central case, whose narrative builds throughout, as well as some minor side vignettes to exemplify some of the arguments being presented. This not only allows the reader to have a better handle on the topic, but see it from multiple perspectives. As I am a big fan of forensic medicine, this book was right up my alley and served as a wonderful way to sit back and relax after some high-intensity reading of late.Kudos, Dr. Melinek and Mr. Mitchell, for this wonderful piece, that served the purpose I needed. I will keep my eyes open for anything else you may write, though will steer clear of any medical journals, even though some of the findings would surely be eye-opening. Love/hate the review?

This book wasn't as polished as Stiff nor was it as focused as Good Mourning but I certainly enjoyed listening to this. This one was able to give a fascinating medical examiner's perspective on the deceased.As described in the title, this book covers the bodies Judy Melinek tacked throughout her residency in a New York morgue. She starts with the natural causes, meanders through a few murders and a couple of heart-wrenching cases. All the while she keeps an upbeat tone. Gallows humor. But, about halfway through the book, all trace of that lightness disappears.9/11 happens and Judy Melinek is in the city. With no one else to turn to, she and the rest of the morgue team has the nearly unimaginable task of processing the twin towers bodies. She was completely overwhelmed and distraught and yet manages to hold her own despite the mountains of bodies in freezers for her to categorize and identify. I felt overwhelmed just reading this. I hadn't read the back of the book before reading this, so I was completely blindsided by the 9/11 tie-in. This is certainly a riveting read - though you may want to read it on an empty stomach if you are squeamish."}, {"userName": "Petra X", "userReviewDate": "May 13, 2015", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/1237196-petra-x", "userReview": "I am so enjoying this book. The author has this strangely cheery tone. She loves her job and the corpses and loves especially discussing really bad wounds and how the people (whom she generally addresses by their first names) got them. Very odd.

It is a bit detailed at what a medical examiner really does for a living and not the TV version. I was fascinated and horrified at some of the things that came through, maybe not at the bodies but what people do to people or what people will do to get out of work. This only covers the time she is at New York but it is during that time that the World Trade Center is hit. The tragic and gruesome chapters there were jarring. This is a book I am glad I came across. None of the details of the work bothered me having seen so much in my life as a nurse but just want to warn those with stomachs weaker than mine to be warned.

(I quit watching years ago.) She does a great job describing what a busy city morgue is like. How she manages to wait for months for paperwork, deals with the crazed public, overworked police, & more just popped so realistically. A 'rush' on a tox screen meant only waiting a week, while a month wasn't unusual. She had to balance knowing part of the picture with releasing the body to relatives while accurately assessing the sort of death it was. Far too often, she only knows half the story & has to move on. Sometimes she comes in on the second half.Her statistics on suicides & attempts were interesting. IIRC, men manage to kill themselves 3 times as often as women, but women make 3 times as many attempts. They're just not very good at it, while guys seem to be good at it even when they don't mean to be. Yet more proof that the sexes are equal, but certainly not the same.How a death certificate is filled out & why was somewhat different than I thought. What constitutes accidental death, homicide, & medical misadventure was interesting. There were far fewer murders than I thought there would be, but some of the stories were pretty horrific. She does a good job describing what she could determine & what she couldn't. Fascinating.Her husband & co-writer T.J. Mitchell must be quite a guy. The chapter on her work during 9/11 & some of the stories she brought home would have had me hovering like a helicopter. I loved the way he supported her.She could certainly cuss like a sailor at times. Can't say as I blame her. Not a lot of it in the book, but she certainly didn't clean anything up for the squeamish. Her descriptions were accurate & sometimes quite grotesque. Probably not a good book to read during lunch.She dwells a bit too much on her father's suicide. While I learned quite a bit the first time she mentioned it, by the end of the book, I was pretty tired of hearing about it.Overall, very well read & a good book. It didn't seem all that long for all that it covered.

In fiction, pathologists often resolve their cases quickly - making lightning fast determinations, intuiting what happened, and (often) nabbing the culprit themselves. This is very different from real life, where toxicology and DNA tests take months to process, coroners' findings are relayed to police detectives, and the cops (hopefully) nab the perp. Moreover, in reality, most deaths are due to natural causes, disease, accidents, undetected anatomical defects, mental illness, and so on - and no crimes are involved. In this enlightening and entertaining book, Dr. Judy Melinek describes her two years as a forensic pathology fellow at the 'Office of the Chief Medical Examiner' (OCME) in New York, where she honed her chops as an ME. The ME's job is to determine the cause and manner of death in cases where the deceased dies suddenly, violently, unexpectedly, in suspicious circumstances, etc. When Melinek graduated from UCLA Medical School in 1996, she wanted to be a surgeon. The surgical residency was grueling, however, and Melinek feared making a mistake that would kill a patient. Thus, Melinek switched her specialty to forensic pathology. Melinek's interest in the field may have stemmed, in part, from the suicide of her father at age 38, when she was 13 years old - an event she discusses extensively in the book. Melinek, her husband J.T. Mitchell (the co-author of this book), and their baby Daniel settled down in New York in 2001. There, Melinek began work at the OCME under the tutelage of Dr. Charles Hirsch - whom she describes as \"a pipe-smoking, avuncular doctor out of a Norman Rockwell painting.\" Among other things, Hirsch held morning rounds and afternoon rounds, at which the medical examiners presented their findings and discussed what to write on death certificates about the cause and manner of death. These determinations were made using a variety of means, such as: the autopsy; visiting the death scene; reviewing medical records; speaking to witnesses; consulting detectives; and so on.....all while collecting evidence that might be used in court. When assigned a body to autopsy, the first thing an ME does is examine the person's external characterstics, and make a record of bruises, cuts, scrapes, scars, tattoos, burns, needle marks, and so on. The ME then goes on to probe the inside of the body, and these procedures are thoroughly described in the book.During her two years at the OCME Melinek worked on a wide variety of cases, including victims of the World Trade Center disaster; people who contracted anthrax from a bioterrorism scare; and bodies from American Airlines Flight 587 - which crashed in NYC. To provide a feel for Melinek's job, I'll give examples of some of the cases she worked on or observed. Cable GuyA man dubbed 'Cable Guy' smoked crystal meth before walking his dogs, and accidently locked himself out of his 9th floor apartment. Instead of calling a locksmith, Cable Guy tied his dogs to the doorknob, went up to the roof, tied a cable around his chest, and tried to rappel down to his open window one floor down. The cable broke and the man fell to his death. Melinek's autopsy showed a fractured skull and shattered ribs that cut through the victim's lungs, esophagus, aorta, and pulmonary artery. The death was ruled accidental. The dogs were fine. Grisly Industrial AccidentAn egg roll factory has a combination shredder-mixer that fills a whole room. The shredder in a Manhattan plant blew apart while spinning, and sent the central drum and blade flying. The blade amputated the arm of one worker, and shrapnel injured two other employees. The metal cylinder landed on the upper chest and neck of a fourth worker, who was pinned to the floor and crushed. Melinek found that the man's head was uninjured and he was fully conscious until he died of suffocation. The unfortunate victim's death was ruled accidental. AlcoholismMelinek performed scores of autopsies on people who died of acute or chronic alcohol intoxication. Melinek's last autopsy in New York was on a victim who died of acute AND chronic alcohol poisoning. A man's dead body was found on the steps of a church in winter. After getting the results of toxicological tests, Melinek determined that the deceased - a chronic alcoholic who had lived on the streets for 30 years - was fall down drunk when he fell asleep and died of hypothermia. The death was ruled an accident. Drug Overdose Deaths from a drug overdose are fairly common, the typical victim being young and otherwise healthy. To fill out the death certificate, Melinek would usually just wait for the toxicology report and write in the cause of death. Drug overdose autopsies were usually quick and easy.....unless the family of the victim couldn't accept the truth. Robert Ward was a 28-year-old white man with a history of alcoholism and drug abuse. One day Robert went out with friends, and was later found dead in his apartment. His mom, Mrs. Ward, didn't want her son autopsied: \"Don't touch my baby.\" An autopsy was required by law, however, and the toxicology report took four months to reach Melinek's office. During that time Mrs. Ward called Melinek at least twice a week, insisting 'Bobby didn't do drugs', and offering other theories for his death. These included: bad sushi, poisonous beer, misuse of a friend's asthma medication, anthrax, Nyquil, and dust mites. When the toxicology report was finally completed, it showed a lethal concoction of heroin, cocaine, and the sedative diazepam.....and Melinek ruled Ward's death an accident. However Mrs. Ward couldn't let it go, and now insisted that Bobby's death was a homicide, the fault of the dealer who sold him the drugs. The Bucket BugabooA police officer brought the OCME a goop-filled bucket that looked like it might contain a dead fetus. An ME carefully emptied the pail, which contained a statuette of kissing angels, maraschino cherries, and a couple of two-foot-long donkey dongs. No fetus. The consensus was that this was probably a Santeria love potion.....not a case for the OCME. (LOL)SuicidesMelinek saw many suicides. These cases were fairly easy to diagnose, especially when they required premeditation and planning - like suicide by hanging, which causes ligature marks on the neck and purple hands and feet. Other suicides during Melinek's tenure at the OCME included people who jumped into the East River, and victims who leapt from the balcony of the Marriott Marquis Hotel in Times Square. The hotel jumpers might have expected a smooth fall to the ground, but they generally pinballed and bumped into structures, severing their limbs and scattering their brains all over. Sometimes apparent 'suicides' were actually homicides or accidents, and the ME's final determination depended on investigation of the death scene; information provided by families and police detectives; a suicide note; and so on. Attack on the World Trade CenterOn September 11, 2001 - nine weeks after Melinek started work at the OCME - two planes collided with the World Trade Center, causing thousands of deaths. The bodies of the victims came to the OCME, and Melinek was one of 30 doctors who worked to identify the remains and assemble evidence of mass murder. Many of the victims had been smashed to bits, and the MEs had to treat each specimen - be it a hand, a toe, a scrap of tissue, etc. - as if it were an entire body.....the goal being to identify the deceased.The bodies and body parts arrived by the truckload, and after DNA was collected, each 'specimen' was assigned to an ME. Melinek's first 'body' was a smashed head and torso - limbs gone, body missing below the naval - which was burned black and smelled of jet fuel. The MEs' sole task was identification, so each doctor tried to use fingerprints, distinguishing marks, personal possessions - whatever they could find - to ID the victims. This was a daunting task that took eight months, during which 'ordinary' autopsies also had to be done. Needless to say, Melinek and her colleagues were overwhelmed.Anthrax ScareThe World Trade Center situation was exacerbated by the anthrax scare, which began a week after 9/11. Someone started sending letters containing anthrax germs to news agencies in New York and Florida, and to politicians in Washington DC. Several people died, and the OCME began to get myriad phone calls from frightened citizens. Moreover, the OCME's technicians were too scared to assist with autopsies, so Melinek and the other MEs had to work alone (or assist each other).Plane CrashAs if 9/11 and the anthrax scare weren't bad enough, New York experienced a major plane wreck in November, 2001. American Airlines Flight 587 crashed soon after taking off from JFK International Airport, killing all 261 souls aboard, as well as five people on the ground. Again the victims' remains were taken to the OCME, where the mauled, twisted, charred, kerosene-contaminated body parts were identified. The cause of the crash - at first thought to be terrorism - was determined to be pilot error. In spite of it all, Melinek enjoyed her job and the 'trial by fire' she endured while working at the OCME. During her time there, Melinek performed 262 autopsies, made 13 court appearances, and had another baby. After completing her two-year fellowship in forensic pathology in 2002, Melinek did a one-year fellowship in neuropathology, then took a job in San Jose, California. Since then Melinek has performed thousands more autopsies.In summary, Melinek notes that she loves the work, the medicine, and the science; she also loves the non-medical aspects of the job, including counseling families, collaborating with detectives, and testifying in court. Sounds good to me! I enjoyed the book, which contains numerous compelling stories about Melinek's - and her colleagues - work, as well as amusing tidbits about the authors' personal lives. I'd recommend this memoir to everyone interested in forensic pathology.

The memoirs of a forensic pathologist during the years of her fellowship, which placed her in NYC during the September 11 terrorist attack, helping to tag, bag, and attempt to identify the remains of victims from the WTC (as well as seeing an anthrax victim, and helping autopsy victims of a infamous plane crash.) It was co-written by her husband, who has an English degree from Harvard (more about that later).Disclaimer: I am a medical doctor, but I am a geriatric psychiatrist. I had to attend autopsies as part of my medical school curriculum, and since we get all the questionable deaths in the state of New Mexico at our Office of the Medical Investigator, I had the privilege of seeing 1 natural death, 3 homicides, and 3 suicides, including one \"decomp\", on the day I was there. I also was informed there was a bag of bones someone had found in a barn they thought might be human, and attended a brain cutting where the brain of a 22 week gestation fetus was sliced, as well as a man who had a fungal infection that was easily visible in many of the slices. So, I have some context for picturing the stuff she's talking about in this book. (Although she talks about how respectful they are with the deceased's testicles....that must vary from location to location, since in one of the suicides I saw that was clearly a gun shot wound to the head, the pathologist still removed both testicles and sliced them up completely. Anyway. Minor point.)To end the disclaimer, I thought autopsies were pretty disgusting. I respect what forensic pathologists do, but I have no illusions about the nitty-gritty of autopsies. That said, I thought she did a great job describing for the lay person what an autopsy is like, what the point of it is, the legal implications of the death determination, etc. And she certainly had a lot of fascinating cases and unusual experiences. The book is very readable and, if you're OK with icky, often quite entertaining and thought-provoking.My critcisms of the book are basically two- first, that it really does read as if it were written by two people, yet always in the first person singular, which made it feel kind of awkwardly constructed to me. It's always the author speaking, but it feels like she would write up an interesting case she saw, then her husband would come behind and add the finishing English major touches to take it from being too much physician speak and more accessible to the general reader. \"Ummm, hon, that part was great, but we're kind of going to alienate the readers if we don't throw in a warm, humanistic anecdote right about now to soften the part about the maggots eating the guy's eyeballs.\" I can't be sure that's how it was or how much of the writing and editing he did, but based on the different tones of certain sections of the book, I get the feeling he did a lot of work- I mean, he's essentially listed as a coauthor. Secondly, the author is certainly more than entitled to personal feelings and reactions to all of the experiences she had. However, she herself goes to great pains to emphasize the necessity of objectivity when speaking as a physician, and not rushing to judgment. As a physician who works with mentally ill patients, I want to emphasize that it is *not* the consensus of the medical community that people who commit suicide are selfish, which the author states she believes over and over again. I understand that she feels that way (\"It's a goddamned selfish act, suicide, if you ask me\" \"He was sober. I couldn't blame drugs. I could only and still blame [her father]\") and as I said, she is entitled to her feelings, including anger toward her father.I just wish that when writing this book, she had gone to greater lengths to separate out her feelings about the suicide of her father as an individual from her knowledge about mental illness as a physician and scientist. There is a lot of research on suicide out there, and a lot of correlations between certain risk factors and completed or attempted suicides, and I have never seen any studies correlating levels of selfishness with suicidality (not really sure how you'd conduct such a study, but I digress). I'll just stop there because this is not the forum for reviewing the latest research into the causes and prevention of suicide, but suffice it to say that judging and shaming people who are having suicidal ideation by telling them how \"selfish\" they are is unlikely to prevent a single person suffering from depression from killing themselves.I mean, she passes harsher judgment upon people- especially fathers of teenage girls- who commit suicide than she does on a woman who murders her 4 year old, drug traders who torture someone and garrot them, or terrorists who commit mass murder or mail anthrax to innocent people. The lashing out against suicides was the antithesis of the objective, accepting tone of the rest of the book, and it was pretty jarring. You can try to empathize with a child abuser or crack addict, but no mercy for suicidal people? Ouch.Overall a decently written and engaging book for any reader interested in the topic."}, {"userName": "Rebecca Foster", "userReviewDate": "Sep 28, 2014", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/5875398-rebecca-foster", "userReview": "If you, like me, have a morbid fascination with the mechanics and aftermath of death (see \nThe Removers\n by Andrew Meredith), you should love this book. Melinek is a forensic pathologist whose father committed suicide \u2013 perhaps an early source of her obsession with dead bodies. An exchange with her husband (co-writer T.J. Mitchell) early on gives a flavor of her macabre tone: \u201c\u2018We even call it an \u201ceggshell skull fracture.\u201d Isn\u2019t that cool?\u2019 \u2018No,\u2019 T.J. replied, suddenly ashen. \u2018No, it isn\u2019t.\u2019 I\u2019m not a ghoulish person. I\u2019m a guileless, sunny optimist, in fact.\u201dOver her two years with New York City\u2019s Office of the Chief Medical Examiner, 2000-2002, Melinek performed 262 autopsies, 27 of them on homicides. Regarding bullet wounds, she writes: \u201cFishing around inside a dead guy for a little chunk of jagged metal that can cut right through my gloves and skin is one workplace challenge I wish I didn\u2019t face.\u201d The Worst Way to Die that she ever observed (because people do persist in asking her the question) was a guy thrown down a manhole \u2013 he basically steamed alive; his organs and blood vessels all cooked solid, like sausage meat.Most notably, Melinek spent eight months identifying 9/11 remains at NYC tent stations. Passersby wouldn\u2019t have known that those lines of trailers all held bodies \u2013 or, rather, partial bodies: \u201cTruck One held whole bodies; Truck Two, bodies that were not complete; Truck Three, body parts; and Truck Four held fragments.\u201d She also had one case towards the beginning of the anthrax outbreak.Only once did my curiosity shade into disgust, and that was with this passage on household pets: \u201cYour faithful golden retriever might sit next to your dead body for days, starving, but the tabby won\u2019t. Your pet cat will eat you right away, with no qualms at all. Like any opportunistic scavenger, it will start with your eyeballs and lips. I\u2019ve seen the result.\u201d I certainly had cause to look askance at my cat after that.Many people\u2019s interest will have been piqued by forensics dramas on TV, but bear in mind that this is more House than CSI: blackly humorous writing about the human body, including some medical whodunits. \u201cMine is a gruesome job, but for a scientist with a love for the mechanics of the human body, a great one.\u201d Melinek largely avoids jargon and doctor-speak, making this a very reader-friendly, enjoyable memoir.In the end, I was left with just two questions: How much did her stay-at-home dad husband contribute? And why did she wait so long before publishing this book? The 2001 material is intriguing, but starts to seem dated. (Perhaps she waited over a decade to let the pain of 9/11 become less raw?)

But suicide is a selfish act, and he wasn't really thinking about her.\" I know the author was writing from a place still affected by the experience with her own father (she wrote about him on pg. 37: \"He was probably thinking, as my first suicide case was probably thinking, 'She'll be better off without me.'

She uproots her family and moves to New York, beginning her training two months before September 11th.Nobody cares about when you're alive, but lots of people take interest when you are dead.I wasn't sure what to expect from this book. I expected some good advice.Don't jaywalk. Use your seatbelt when you drive. Better yet, stay out of your car and get some exercise. Watch your weight. If you are a smoker, stop right now. Guns put holes in people.I also expected to be scared A LOT by the various ways you could suddenly wind up on an autopsy table. And while she does touch on one of the worst ways in her opinion to die, most of her encounters with the dead were easily avoidable.Staying alive, as it turns out, is mostly common sense.And I expected to learn some fascinating and disgusting things about the human body. Like how hairless shins with a variety of other things is a symptom of heart failure.But all expectations aside hearing the struggle of balancing being a mother, a wife and a woman who deals with death daily quickly made this an engrossing read. It isn't all about the bodies. It is also about the woman behind the bodies. Holding the scalpel.However the chapter on being a pathologist in New York during the events of September 11, 2001 was probably the toughest part of this book to read and ultimately the most powerful. I'd recommend this for that part alone. You didn't hear a lot about the medical examiners after the events, but ultimately they gave a lot of relief to a lot of families.I am just glad I didn't read this before my son's \"minor surgery\".

As one does. Someone was talking about Caitlin Doughty's book Smoke Gets in Your Eyes: And Other Lessons from the Crematory, which I had just started as my Lunchtime Reading Book (meaning I try to read it during lunch but I never succeed unless I go to my car to reatd (that's read and eat combined) because I always wind up talking to someone) and I was able to go all fangirl over Caitlin, whose Order of the Good Death I've been following since Mom was all, \"I have cancer and am DYING!\" (only, she's still not dead, so...I question the veracity of her statement) and I wanted to prepare myself for what was coming (which was never-ending dying, as it turns out) One of the other conversers said, \"Oh! Have you read Working Stiff?\" and I said, \"I have not!\" and she said, \"You should. You'd love it\" and I said, \"Ok, I will!\" and I did.But here's the twist: I'd promised the people to whom I'd gushed that I would email them links to the many social sites of Caitlin Doughty. Upon retrieving said links, I found I wasn't following her on Twitter, which is weird since I follow her everywhere else, but whatever. I hit that Follow button and all was well. Then, I sent the email full of links, patted myself on the back for a job well-done, and hopped over to the library catalog to request a copy of this book (Working Stiff, in case you've forgotten what I'm talking about)Later in the day, I went back over to Twitter and saw a notification that said that Judy Melinek was following me and I thought, \"That name sounds VEEERRRY familiar\" Yeah, it's cuz she's the author of this book and when I figured that out, I messaged her in order to say (essentially) \"WHY ARE YOU STALKING ME?\" because, seriously, what are the odds I'd put an author's book on hold at my library - and there's no way she could know that because it's a closed system - and then she follows me hours later on Twitter? What was happening?She pretty much said, \"Well, crazy lady (she didn't call me a crazy lady, she's much nicer than that. I'm just paraphrasing for her), you followed Caitlin Doughty earlier today and I often follow people who follow her because of shared interests. Obviously. You are so paranoid.\" (Again, paraphrasing. She said nothing of the sort. I don't even think she thought I was crazy and paranoid at all because a wonderful conversation ensued and now I love this woman)So, technically, I met the author before I read this book.That didn't change my feelings toward the book, though, because as my co-worker surmised, this thing is right up my alley. For the record, that co-worker was the one who practically forced me to read Station Eleven (no force was involved whatsoever); she knows what I like.SO!

It could be the fact that I always wanted to get into forensics, or my own morbid fascination with the things people do to one another.

Melinek is a forensic pathologist who teams up with author husband TJ Mitchell to recall stories and lessons learned while serving as a pathology fellow at the New York City Office of the Chief Medical Examiner.Does anyone set out to establish oneself in a career in forensic pathology? Judy Melinek did not. She did, however, want to be a surgeon. But once she determined that the arduous hours of surgical residency were not what she wanted for her marriage or her soon-to-be-born child, she took advantage of the fellowship opportunity in New York. Her husband, who becomes a stay-at-home dad, is incredibly supportive, even though he seems aghast at some of the autopsies she performs. After all, this is not the usual, \u201cHoney, how was your day?\u201d kind of a job.Dr. Melinek writes with intelligence, with humor, and yes, with graphic detail. Authors, you can\u2019t make some of this stuff up! When she uses doctor-speak, she generally follows up with layman\u2019s terms. I suspect that her husband had something to do with that, although she also credits her mentor, Dr. Charles Hirsch, for that advice. In fact, she has great respect for Hirsch and learned a great deal under his tutelage.Many of the death scenes she describes are horrific, the kind that made me want to cover my eyes and practically pinch my nose as I imagined the details. The most challenging events of her tenure, I imagine, were the back-to-back-to-back headliners in 2001. First, there was the tragedy that occurred on September 11 when two jetliners crashed into the twin towers of the World Trade Center. Dr. Melinek chronicles these days and weeks, recalling the emotions, the fatigue, and the sheer enormity of the task of tagging and identifying bodies and body parts. The team had barely finished this task when the anthrax scare happened. Then, just when she and two other colleagues were about to get a respite from the morgue by attending a conference in Washington, D.C., a major plane crash forced them to return to NYC to autopsy mangled bodies.What demanding, even disturbing work! As Dr. Melinek implies, it requires not only fortitude, but also intellectual curiosity, empathy, and compassion. She states that she is often asked how she can do what she does. She quotes others as saying, \u201cYou get used to it.\u201d Her response is more human, \u201cIt\u2019s about the living. You and me. I do it for you.\u201d Her father was a psychiatrist who committed suicide when she was thirteen. Judy feels compassion for survivors of suicide victims. In her opinion, suicide is \u201ca selfish act.\u201d To me, this reveals the deep-seated pain of someone who has lost a loved one, and she is entitled to that. Some may see it as disrespectful or unfeeling toward persons with mental illness, and perhaps they, too, have a point. Overall, I was impressed with Melinek as a savvy, diligent clinician who can do a difficult job and still maintain her sense of humor and go home to her family at night. It seems to me that that takes a pretty special person. If I were a writer of mysteries, I would be thrilled to add this book to my reference shelf.5 stars"}, {"userName": "Rebecca McNutt", "userReviewDate": "Nov 28, 2017", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/36977686-rebecca-mcnutt", "userReview": "Working Stiff has morbid written all over it, but actually it surprised me.

Of course not. But it is blunt, honest, and Judy Melinek also resists all the usual Doctor syndrome aspects of hiding a personality, bias, feelings of an individual- behind the badge and highly authoritarian onus of the M.D. that is behind her name.Rarely am I tempted to do a synopsis, rather than a reaction. For this one I am sorely tempted to tell you far more than just my take. Some of these chapters are absolutely unique in SPECIFIC information. Stated too within medical and official jargon, and then often translated for her layman's tale. She tells us what she sees. She tells us what her job is. It is not what many TV shows or court room scenes leave you to believe it is. She is not a lawyer, or a Homicide Detective. Although she constantly detects and she does appear in court on some occasions. Her onus first and foremost is to put one of six things on a legal and official death certificate. NYC has six categories only, and the full explanation is terse, as well. Some states or countries have 5 or 7. It often takes months to fill that one line.They are: Suicide, Homicide, Disease, Accident, Medical Complication/Interaction, or Undecided/Undetermined. That's it. Before the book is finished, you will read of some few cases that are being determined over months of time between THREE of these categories. Determination between not just two, but three, all strong possibilities before the final decision is put on the Death Certificate line. And often times grand jury or some other jurisdiction is waiting for that line to be printed. Because timing of demise, situations of opposing or serendipity causes, and physical proofs may oppose themselves in category or clues when their origin or sequential consequence order is unknown. When she finds a real zebra amongst the horses, she proclaims \"Isn't that cool!\" and tells you why. Many readers may not parse with her interjections. Or become highly offended. But reading what these hours include, as far as I am concerned she can say anything she wants to, and in any mood or tone at that. This job has been rather glorified on TV. And you hear lots of details about body parts or descriptions of the testing done on them, but none are in the degree that you hear about here in this book. If you don't care for the medical and intense detail, this survey is not for you.She was working during 9/11, fairly new in fact. She leaves that portion of her time in NYC for nearer to the end of the book. There are good reasons for it. I knew with my head and my heart, but I didn't REALLY know. You know after reading her sorting lines, blocks of refrigerated trucks. She also had near the end of her stint, a 250 plus person air crash (all fatal plus 5 more on the ground). By comparing those two events' autopsy results, you understand what is missing in one and not the other.She covers too, not only the exact issues and context of her own health and life that with some serendipity switched her surgeon's role into one that was more conducive to sleeping and a family life. But also the special sense she has of solving hard problems that are often quite different or original biology. If a doctor is dead tired, fainting sick and not able to remain standing for 40 hours straight, there is always a better way to practice. And \"The patient will still be dead tomorrow, and they don't mind waiting.\" Others warn readers who may have queasy stomachs. I would warn far more to those who want a PC formula \"nice-nice\" emotive condolence for life's meanest and grimmest occasions. This is not a lady who seeks to condole first. She often surmounts to do just that visceral connection and much more. But she is not phony in calling a situation what it is NOT in order to help grievers rationalize a cozier self acceptance. Many might well be offended. To me it was absolutely refreshing. And also most highly trustworthy for ACTUAL good intent and concern, at that. Give me a Doctor like this rather than one who mouths all the platitudes.She is the daughter of a brilliant doctor who was a suicide at 38. Those suicide cases she reviews were worth the reading of this book alone. Because I have been one of those people who have witnessed the exact kinds of events she details. The train jump, the building jump. I never go to a place of open balconies or 20 floor atriums without thinking about it. People like myself who have seen them are forever affected. Affect, as in feelings. You can't erase it. It doesn't look like the movies or chewy horror film special effects. That's usually because it hits all kinds of things on the way down for one thing. Almost always, it is not all there. You will learn why 7 bullet holes require different tracking methods and why one or two is so much easier. And why nearly the first rule right now in autopsy is taking off all the piercing and attached decoration, noting scars, tattoos in great detail, sometimes with drawings. This book taught me more about how a corpse could reveal as completely bloodless (rare occurrence with a certain instant velocity death- the bone marrow absorbs all the blood), how a blood transfusion can cause an antibody crisis/ fatal reaction (blood hook up transfer starts- bad back pain instantly- yell like hell)and several other exact factual context situations that I had never read upon any detail before this book. She doesn't cut out the depth either for their \"solving\" situation. Anyone who is depressed, lives in a city, drives a car, thinks suicide is a way to make things easier for the survivors, or is going to die. All of those people should read this book.

Judy MelinekAfter reading this book I really wish I had become a medical examiner...weird I know ;-) It was fascinating. The one thing that would probably make me quit that job though would be the smell of a decomposing body...It hits you--an assault, not a scent. You flinch, heave back in revulsion. It invades your throat, assails your taste buds, even stings your eyes.The maggot talk just validated my wish to be immediately sealed in a metal drawer in a mausoleum after I die. I also knew there had to be a reason I'm allergic to cats...they will eat you immediately after you die. Whereas dogs will just stay by you for days on end. The last quarter of this book was completely spellbinding, in my opinion. She was a NYC Medical Examiner on 9/11. She heard and saw that low flying jetliner when she was hurrying to work that morning. It is even more horrific through her eyes than what I heard and saw on the news. She tagged body pieces (and the descriptions of their condition were awful)...many refrigerated tractor trailers' worth of body parts, a small number of intact bodies.The limbs had all been amputated. The torso was transected below the navel. The remains were entirely black--burned and covered in soot. The head...the head wasn't recognizable as a head, except that it had hair and was attached to the neck. The smell of jet fuel was so strong it made me dizzy. I could tell just by looking at the open body bag that this person had been mashed, burned, dropped from a height, and slashed by sharp forces. I had seen people killed by subway trains and speeding cars, run over by trucks, crushed by industrial equipment, fallen from great heights, burned, and battered--but never all at the same time.I examined the surface of the leg--and came across something that made me stare. Fragments of a personal bank check, complete with routing number and a partially legible name, were embedded under the skin, buried deep in the muscle tissue....an X-ray had revealed a woman's severed hand, complete with wedding ring, entirely embedded inside the chest wall of a man's intact torso.This quote from the Chief Medical Examiner at the time is haunting: People were jumping or falling from the buildings. They seemed to take forever to fall, tumbling through the air. They would hit the pavement with a loud thud--very loud--and bounce, and land again. The sounds of the bodies hitting the ground echoed off the buildings, one after another, over and over.

I don't read much non-fiction but I have a fascination with death and what happens to your body after you die. That's why I picked this up. Maybe it's because we don't really talk about it as a society. It's too taboo or gross or a combination of both I don't know.This book covers the first year of Dr. Melinek's fellowship in NYC as a medical examiner. She doesn't go through all 262 cases but picks highlights to show was is involved in the different types of death. She does a really good job of breaking down all the medical jargon into laymen's terms without sounding condescending. Part of an MEs training is to learn how to do that since they deal with grieving family members. Each case is its own little story and I was surprised at how much detective work an ME actually does. If there is no criminal homicide for the police to investigate (and only about 30% of autopsy cases are criminal in nature) it is up to the ME to piece together what happened and not just physically. They have to understand the circumstances surrounding the death and that involves some legwork.The final section of the book is about 9/11. Melinek was only 9 weeks into her fellowship when this happened. I've heard a lot of stories about the brave work of the firefighters and police on that day but I haven't heard anything about the MEs. The only medical stories I've heard were about all the doctors and nurses waiting at the hospitals for the wounded to come in and how devastated they were when only a fraction of the number expected showed up. Now imagine what all the MEs had to go through. It was heartbreaking and interesting at the same time. They were able to identify approximately half of those that died that day. Considering what they had to work with it's pretty amazing.If you have any interest in this area I highly recommend picking up this book."}, {"userName": "Sarah", "userReviewDate": "Mar 08, 2015", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/11818290-sarah", "userReview": "9/3 - Reading this, I feel like this it's the true story of Kay Scarpetta, for the new century. I like Melinek's voice and style of writing and her irreverent way of looking at death. I love the way she describes her reaction to shows featuring characters doing her job - the fact that they go to every crime scene, the women wear their good high-heeled shoes, they actually help with the investigation. From now on CSI will be light-hearted crime fiction, in the same league as those 'cosy mysteries' that feature little old lady super-sleuths, not a realistic look into the life of a medical examiner. I can see the irony and humour in some of the causes of death that she sees (although, not when contemplating my own future). For example, an unfortunate worker having his morning coffee gets hit in the head by a giant crane, a crane so large that he is practically crumpled into the ground like an aluminium can. Although, at the same time reading medical nonfiction does hit a bit close to home for someone only weeks away from having major surgery to remove a 9 x 7 cm suspicious mass, along with 25% of her liver. Maybe I shouldn't be reading this right now... So far I'm enjoying it despite the negative thoughts it's bringing up. To be continued...12/3 - Not as bad as I thought it was going to be re bringing up disturbing thoughts, except for one of the later chapters focussing on deaths due to 'medical misadventures' or 'therapeutic complications' as Melinek puts it - when a patient dies during non-emergent surgery due to surgeon error. Reading about the ordeal Melinek and her fellow medical examiners went through in the aftermath of September 11 was a little tough, even for someone who's never been to New York - body bags becoming body part bags becoming body bit bags (a lump of skin, a piece of an intestine) and thinking of all the families who don't KNOW what happened to their father, mother, son, daughter. That was really sad. I do wonder how she remembered the details of all these cases, from 14 years ago, so vividly, even seeming to repeat conversations word for word. I also wonder how she managed to get all the patient's families to agree to have their family member's death story revealed in the ME's memoir. There was no mention anywhere of the names having been changed to protect the surviving family members, so I have to assume that all those names are real. Whatever the case, highly recommended to those with a strong stomach and a lack of anxiety regarding all the ways they and their loved ones could die.PopSugar 2015 Reading Challenge: A Memoir"}, {"userName": "Sonja Arlow", "userReviewDate": "Sep 29, 2014", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/6449756-sonja-arlow", "userReview": "\u2018Let conversation cease.

The author seems to be quite an optimistic ray of sunshine in an industry that leans towards the dark and depressing. She conveys the stories at times with humor, at times with sadness but always with compassion and respect.\u201cPeople ask me all the time, \u201cWhat\u2019s the worst way to die you\u2019ve ever seen?\u201d I assure them, \u201cYou don\u2019t want to know.\u201d She was right.

All I can say is I will never eat lobster again, EVER.She is frank and outspoken about suicide and whether I agree with her views or not, I could sympathize with her. Having lived through her own fathers suicide at the age of 13 it clearly left scars still visible in her adult life.I heard about this author from a GR friend\u2019s review and also knew beforehand that she was most famous for the 8 months she provided medical support in the 9/11 aftermath. What I did not expect was how much of an emotional read Chapter 10 would be for me. I have the utmost respect for each and every person who was involved in the First Responder teams and everyone else that assisted them. Every doctor has to cultivate compassion, to learn it and then practice it. To confront death every day, to see it for yourself, you have to love the living.\u2003Would I recommend this?

I put it down several times because I nearly cried. I still relive that day so vividly and reading her account of that awful morning- then the task she had of trying to identify only body parts or small pieces of DNA just killed me. I obviously knew the carnage of that day but it just never occurred to me that they barely pulled bodies out of the World Trade Center, it was particles of people. Of the thousands of people killed, only 291 bodies in tact were found. There are still over 1,000 people who never had remains found. These chapters were just terrible and I found myself tearing up.

That is what I had to keep reminding myself. This is a personal account of Judy Melinek's two years working as a forensic pathologist with the Office of the Chief Medical Examiner in New York. I have found out information about decomposing bodies, burns and dismemberment that I did not know were possible. And given that Judy's time there encompassed September 11, 2001 and the scale that OCME had to deal with in deaths is beyond comprehension.As terrible as some of the accounts were, it was also a fitting tribute to the unsung heroes who give their time to answer questions for those who are still living and need resolution, justice or just consolation.If however, you find something like Agatha Christie or Midsummer Murders confronting and grisly then you may wish to steer clear."}], "description": "The fearless memoir of a young forensic pathologist's rookie season as a NYC medical examiner, and the cases, hair-raising and heartbreaking and impossibly complex, that shaped her as both a physician and a mother.Just two months before the September 11 terrorist attacks, Dr. Judy Melinek began her training as a New York City forensic pathologist. With her husband T.J. and their toddler Daniel holding down the home front, Judy threw herself into the fascinating world of death investigation, performing autopsies, investigating death scenes, counseling grieving relatives. Working Stiff chronicles Judy's two years of training, taking readers behind the police tape of some of the most harrowing deaths in the Big Apple, including a firsthand account of the events of September 11, the subsequent anthrax bio-terrorism attack, and the disastrous crash of American Airlines flight 587.Lively, action-packed, and loaded with mordant wit, Working Stiff offers a firsthand account of daily life in one of America's most arduous professions, and the unexpected challenges of shuttling between the domains of the living and the dead. The body never lies, and through the murders, accidents, and suicides that land on her table, Dr. Melinek lays bare the truth behind the glamorized depictions of autopsy work on shows like CSI and Law and Order to reveal the secret story of the real morgue.", "title": "Working Stiff: Two Years, 262 Bodies, and the Making of a Medical Examiner", "url": "http://www.goodreads.com/book/show/18775327-working-stiff", "average": 4.13, "cover": "https://images.gr-assets.com/books/1408319717l/18775327.jpg", "reviews": 1375, "authors": [{"url": "https://www.goodreads.com/author/show/7382113.Judy_Melinek", "name": "Judy Melinek"}, {"url": "https://www.goodreads.com/author/show/1899585.T_J_Mitchell", "name": "T.J.
