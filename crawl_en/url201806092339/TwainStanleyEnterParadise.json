(Though I knew little of Stanley before reading this book - beyond the obvious accounts of his fabled career - as a self-acknowledged \"Twainiac\" I know a lot about Mark Twain.) This is a magical story with one of the most unique narrative structures I\u2019ve ever experienced; it will leave readers wishing that Hijuelos could write another volume about the pair."}, {"userName": "Mij Woodward", "userReviewDate": "May 11, 2015", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/5222282-mij-woodward", "userReview": "This book is for the true historical-fiction nerd, of which I am one. I loved Hijuelos' imagination that came up with supposed letters and journal entries, and the narrative that painted a picture of the friendship between Twain and Stanley and Stanley's wife, Dorothy Tennant.However, some of the chapters required resolve and fortitude to get through. They seemed to meander and go on and on.I am proud to report that I stuck with those chapters, which numbered far less than the chapters that genuinely held my interest.I now feel I am sort of an expert on the biography of Stanley, and have more knowledge about Samuel Clemens' personality. Hijuelos presents a more positive view about Clemens than did Lynn Cullen in Twain's End. However, it's possible he did not utilize some of the sources that Cullen used.It felt like Hijuelos believed the caricature we've all had of the Mark Twain we want Samuel Clemens to be. Probably a more honest assessment would include some of the observations from Cullens book.I liked the parts in this book that scathingly revealed how Stanley dealt with natives in the Congo, though politically, he was very much against slavery. His actions on behalf of Belgium clearly paved the way for colonialism.However, a few chapters, especially toward the end of the book, bored me with polemics about some political notion, or other ideas, pros and cons. Please, dear author, leave the pontificating out. Bores me to tears. I just want the STORY.Which, for the most part, Hijuelos gives us here. A story of a lasting life-long friendship, and of two men who were adventurers in their youth, and then grew old and died."}, {"userName": "Toto", "userReviewDate": "Nov 04, 2015", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/11218866-toto", "userReview": "Hijuelos had one marvelous book in him, Mambo Kings; after that book everything he wrote was either overlong or overwritten. This one is no exception. The problem with Paradise is actually twofold: tedium and lack of a dramatic arc. After the first 100 pages or so, Stanley's early adulthood story -- told in the I went-there-then-I-went-there fashion, sags and the parts in which he grows up, travels the world and becomes an explorer never comes alive. What's truly unconscionable for me is that Twain as presented here is a pontificating, speechifying dullard! Hijuelos never struck me as a writer with a funny bone hidden somewhere, which is fine for everything else he wrote, but this story needs Twain's humor to capture the 37-year bon homie between the two men. There are historical curiosities drawn very well here, such as the relationship Twain is purported to have had with Mrs. Stanley, the painter Dorothy Tennant, and various otherworldly hobbies he is said to have participated in, such as seances. But overall, the weighty tone of Stanley's story of the first section of the book and unconvincing didatic voice of Tennant's diaries in the second become tedius as the book chugs along. A missed opportunity, I would say."}, {"userName": "Garrett Zecker", "userReviewDate": "Jan 13, 2016", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/5923872-garrett-zecker", "userReview": "This is certainly going to be one of the best books that I have read in 2016, and I am able to recognize that right off the bat. To begin, I am a scholar on Twain and his work, and I try to read and experience as much as I can as it is released (as much as I can keep up with, anyway). This was only the second Hijuelos book I have read, the first being Mambo Kings when I was in high school. This final book was something that Hijuelos worked on for ten years, and it is purported that he was editing the manuscript and making final touches and revisions the day he died. His dedication to this passion project was such that he wanted it to be perfect, and to be honest, I couldn't imagine a more fitting, beautiful, and perfect project to round out a career with. While it was edited posthumously, the result seems to be something that Hijuelos should be incredibly and impressively proud of were he alive to see it through to publication.The story is a variety of viewpoints and approaches to the relationship that Henry Morton Stanley and Mark Twain had during their lives. It begins at the beginning, and ends at the end, and is told in documents, first person, and third person narratives and epistles. It is beautiful. It is complete. It is perfect. It is an absolutely beautiful triumph. What I found to be the most magical thing about this book is the manner in which Hijuelos is able to weave real source documents and fictional additions to create this completely immersive Victorian world. The men are stark and three-dimensional within these pages, and we experience the pain, suffering, and triumphs each of them faced throughout their careers and their inter-personal choices. This believable, magical structure allows for the seamless kinetic energy that rolls this amazing narrative along on a steam train, until it fizzles into a gorgeous reflection on the lives and the work of these two men as their existence fades out into the blackness of the universe. What we are left with is a deep appreciation of their fraternity, their work, and an accurate and gorgeous rendition of what these men were able to accomplish in love and life. The complexity with which Hijuelos presents the material's fact and fiction is just magnificent, and what prose he wrote is a true inspiration to myself as a writer. In communicating what may be bone dry and dusty to a wide audience, he has been able to plant the seeds of story he kept in his heart for three decades, tend and fertilize it, and have it bloom into a gorgeous book in his final days is a testament to a wonderful career and a gravitational talent. In truth, I could think of fewer perfect passion projects that any writer has had, and was able to finish with such poetic flair. Hijuelos' book is a true masterpiece of modern fiction that draws from true documents, growing the relationship and lives of two very important men into a beautiful, timeless bloom of a book."}, {"userName": "Patty", "userReviewDate": "Dec 02, 2015", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/301240-patty", "userReview": "A novel about the friendship between Mark Twain and Henry Morton Stanley (he of the famous \u2013 or infamous \u2013 line \"Dr. Livingstone, I presume?\"). There's not much of a plot; this is rather a meandering collection of moments across the two men's lives, with a much greater focus on Stanley than Twain. Stanley's wife, Dorothy Tennant, a wealthy painter, is also a prominent character \u2013 probably moreso than Twain, which is unfortunate because of all the historical and fictional figures in this book, he was the only one I liked and enjoyed spending time with. The book switches between epistolary style (diaries, letters, and segments of autobiographies), and more straight-forward third person limited POVs. The only real structure the book has is that it's bookended by twin retellings of the same moment in Stanley's life: when, at about age 20, he went searching for his adopted father who had disappeared in Cuba. The tellings (one by Stanley and one by Twain) differ significantly. Rather than plot, there's a strong thematic thread holding the book together; characters are constantly ruminating on death, the afterlife, fame, their legacies, and especially the inevitability of the passing of time. I don't like to read too much autobiography into novels, but it's extremely hard to avoid the reflection that this is a book written at the end of Hijuelos's life, and in fact only edited and published after his death.I didn't like this book. The lack of any sort of plot made it feel as though it was dragging on forever, and the constant references to an Ozymandius-like passing of all grandeur just made me think of better things I could be doing with my time than reading this book. In addition, I found it incredibly hard to have any sympathy or patience with Stanley. He's a man who both served in the Confederate Army in the US Civil War and worked for King Leopold. Stanley is, in fact, responsible to some degree in the founding of the Congo Free State (trigger warning on that link for pretty much every terrible thing you can imagine; literally the URL is \"Humanitarian Disaster\"). And I'm not saying that Hijuelos should have changed these things! They're a matter of historical record, and if you're going to write about real people, these are the sorts of issues you must confront. But Hijuelos chooses to deal with it by... ignoring it, mostly, or including as few references as physically possible, which often involves skipping over entire years or decades of Stanley's life. If I had not already known about the problems of the Congo Free State, I could easily have finished this book without even being aware they existed. The writing itself was great, but it's hard for me to care about Stanley dating some lady when part of my mind is screaming, \"ARE WE JUST NOT GOING TO TALK ABOUT THE FACT THAT YOU WORK FOR A LITERAL GENOCIDAL MONSTER?\"And no, we never do talk about it. At least not in this book.On the other hand, hey, it turns out Mark Twain is cooler than I'd realized! Did you know he was an active campaigner for women's suffrage, spoke out against missionaries, campaigned heavily against imperialism, particularly in the context of the Spanish-American war and the US expansion into the Phillipines, and supported unions and the labor movement? I wish he had been the focus of this book instead of Stanley. I read this as an ARC via NetGalley."}, {"userName": "Nostalgia Reader", "userReviewDate": "Oct 30, 2016", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/6560108-nostalgia-reader", "userReview": "I wasn't sure what to expect from this, but I was pleasantly surprised and very enraptured by the storytelling and style. While it sounds like, and reads in some places like, a biography of Twain and Stanley it is 100% fiction--Hijuelos made up not just dialogue, but the journal entries, letters, etc. I was a bit disappointed with the fact that there wasn't any \"works cited\"--did Hijuelos base his style off of letters actually written by Twain, Stanley, and Dolly, or did he completely make it up? But it's not too much of a peeve to dwell on, because the style was very beautiful and there was a distinct voice that each character had. The pacing is a bit different, and I was disappointed that most of Stanley's time in Africa was glossed over (him finding Livingstone was mentioned in a brief sentence when it happened in the timeline, and only expanded upon much later), but this was supposed to be more of a biography of a friendship, rather than a biography of each author's life.The themes throughout were also very well done. I loved how both Twain and Stanley talked about the idealness of youth, the nostalgia that they had for it sometimes being the only thing to hold on to during rough times.If you're interested in this book, but still skeptical, I would recommend you give it a try. It oddly sucks you in, getting you deeply invested in the characters and their subtle voices, and painting a wide-arching history that's diverse enough not to get bored with. It does start out heavily favoring and focusing on Stanley's past, but as the book goes along, Twain gets gradually more equal page time."}, {"userName": "Bob Schnell", "userReviewDate": "Nov 05, 2015", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/16802193-bob-schnell", "userReview": "\"Twain & Stanley Enter Paradise\" is a 12 year labor of love and the last book written by the late Oscar Hijeulos. Mr. Hijuelos was apparently obsessed with both Samuel Clemens and the explorer Henry Morton Stanley who, apparently, were long-time friends though neither wrote much about the other. This book is Mr. Hijuelos' fantasy of what that friendship may have entailed, written as a (entirely fictional)collection of letters, journal entries, speech excerpts, etc. A third person, Stanley's wife Dorothy Tennant is also well-represented to add a third party view of the relationship between the two men. The whole thing is brought off marvelously well and I would have believed it was non-fiction if I hadn't known otherwise.In the novel, the two future world figures meet on the Mississippi riverboat captained by Clemens. Their shared love of literature leads to a friendship that is mostly long distance as each go their separate ways in the world. They do share an adventure in Cuba looking for Stanley's adoptive father and the \"secret\" of that trip is the loose thread that binds the book's story together. In my opinion, this one device is an unnecessary gimmick as the book would be altogether delightful without it. Just letting their life stories unfold in correspondence is engaging enough. As a fan of Twain, the letters and other writings attributed to him ring true. This is the best example I've found so far of an historical fiction with Clemens/Twain as a major character (and there seem to be more of those every day)."}, {"userName": "Bonnye Reed", "userReviewDate": "Aug 30, 2015", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/10604067-bonnye-reed", "userReview": "XXX I was not aware that we had lost this wonderful author.

This is a difficult book to review in large part because it was published posthumously; who knows how Hijuelos would have constructed the final product had he lived to shepherd it to completion. Given that Hijuelos devoted over 12 years of his life to this project\u2014an effort still clear even in this disjointed work\u2014it is highly probable that he would have sacrificed even more time in pursuit of a more perfect novel. That said, Twain and Stanley Enter Paradise is a good, if not great, read. Twain and Stanley Enter Paradise focuses on the friendship between American author Mark Twain and Welsh explorer and writer Henry Morton Stanley. \u201cParadise\u201d largely represents childhood here, that pleasant meandering through the beginning stages of life when the unknown is exciting and everything is possible. Twain\u2019s early life represented that idyllic experience, Stanley\u2019s much less so. The distinction is highlighted in the way each man determined his pseudonym and offers greater insight into the book's characters. Samuel Clemens paid homage to his work as a steamboat pilot in the moniker Mark Twain. The pseudonym illustrated his wonder and love for the intricacies of river travel. Even as he embraced \u201cMark Twain\u201d the author, he recognized and welcomed Samuel Clemens as his real persona. John Rowlands, on the other hand, was an unloved reject who was obliterated with the \u201cbirth\u201d of Henry Morton Stanley. Morton\u2019s self-construction often bordered on the fictive; rather than offering a distinction between a personal and professional life, it served rather as reinvention. And so the self-confidence of Twain is often juxtaposed with the dubious authenticity, and real angst, of Stanley. This tension makes for an interesting telling, and reading, of the friendship between these men. The book is at its best when the men are actively engaged in adventure\u2014either sailing the Mississippi, traveling to and through Cuba, or engaged in incursions of the African continent. In addition to these exploits, the book focuses on the growing fame of the two men, with all its concomitant benefits and disadvantages; the familial lives of both men (with interesting, if uneven, attention given to Stanley\u2019s wife, the beautiful, eccentric painter and socialite Dorothy Tennant), and their end-of-life preoccupations with time and religion. Their social circles are also peppered with members of the aristocracy (Queen Victoria, King Leopold), the literati (Henry James, Bram Stoker, Arthur Conan Doyle, etc.), and many other historical notables which work to enliven the novel.

It was a labor of love for Hijuelos, who worked on the project for more than ten years, publishing other novels along the way but always returning to Twain and Stanley; indeed, he was still revising the manuscript the day before his sudden passing in 2013.\tThe resulting novel is a richly woven tapestry of people and events that is unique among the author's works, both in theme and structure. Hijuelos ingeniously blends correspondence, memoir, and third-person omniscience to explore the intersection of these Victorian giants in a long vanished world.\tFrom their early days as journalists in the American West, to their admiration and support of each other's writing, their mutual hatred of slavery, their social life together in the dazzling literary circles of the period, and even a mysterious journey to Cuba to search for Stanley's adoptive father, TWAIN & STANLEY ENTER PARADISE superbly channels two vibrant but very different figures.
