The appearance of the follow up offers a perfect justification for stepping through those bat-wing doors for the first time. 1st Edition cover \u2013 Published January 28, 1977 \u2013 447 ppsIt has been a lifetime since I read The Shining for the first time, over thirty years ago. I enjoyed it then for its effectiveness in telling a scary, no, a very scary story. Reading it now is colored, as is all of life, by our accumulation (or lack of accumulation) of experience. We see, or appreciate colors, textures, shapes, structures, and feelings with more experienced, educated eyes. We have seen, or are at least aware of real world things that are scarier than any fictional spectres. So, what does it look like through old, cloudy lenses?It remains a very scary story. The things that stand out for me now are not so much the deader rising up out of a bathtub to pursue a curious child, although that is still pretty creepy, or the mobile topiary, which still works pretty well at making the hair on one\u2019s neck and arms stand at attention. But King was using the haunted house trope to look at more personal demons. And those shine through more clearly now.From Allyn Scura\u2019s blogHe had some drinking issues at the time he wrote the book, when he was 30, and concern about that is major here. Jack Torrance is an alcoholic, no question. He also has issues with anger management, not that the little shit he clocks while teaching at a New England prep school didn\u2019t have it coming. He did. But one cannot do that to a student, however deserving, and expect to remain employed for long. His little boy, however, most certainly did not deserve a broken arm. Jack is very remorseful, and wants to make things right. He manages to get a gig taking care of the Overlook Hotel in Colorado over the winter. It will offer him a chance to get something right after a string of getting things wrong, offer a chance to save his marriage, and offer an opportunity to work on his unfinished play. Risky? Sure. But a gamble worth taking. And his wife, Wendy, agrees, despite having serious misgivings. There are no attractive alternatives. Of course, we all know that the Overlook is not your typical residence. Odd things happen, sounds are heard, thoughts from somewhere outside find their way into your mind. Jack is targeted, and boy is he vulnerable.But five-year-old Danny is the real key here. He is the proud possessor of an unusual talent, the shining of the book\u2019s title. Danny can not only do a bit of mind-reading, he can also see things that other people cannot. And for a little guy he has a huge talent. He also has an invisible friend named Tony with whom only he can communicate. It is difficult to think about the book without finding our mental screens flickering with the images of Jack Nicholson in full cartoonish psycho rage, the very effective sound of a Big Wheel followed by a steadicam coursing through the long halls of the hotel, and the best casting decision ever in choosing Scatman Crothers to play Dick Halloran. By the way, the hotel is based on a real-world place, the Stanley Hotel, in Estes Park, Colorado. And the Overlook\u2019s spooky room 217 was inspired by the supposedly haunted room 217 at the Stanley. This image is from the hotel\u2019s site \u2013 they clearly embrace the spectral connectionThe room number was changed in the film to 237, at the request of the Timberline hotel, which was used for exterior shots. There is so much that differentiates Kubrick\u2019s film from the book that they are almost entirely different entities. The differences do require a bit of attention here. First, and foremost, the book of The Shining is about the disintegration of a family due to alcoholism and anger issues. How a child survives in a troubled family is key. The film is pretty much pure spook house, well-done spook house, but solely spook house, nonetheless, IMHO. There is considerable back-story to Jack and Wendy that gets no screen time. You have to read the book to get that. Jack is a victim, as much as Wendy and Danny. You would never get that from the slobbering Jack of the film. The maze in the book was pretty cool, right? I liked it too, but it does not exist in the book. I believe it was put in to replace the talented topiary, which is the definition of a bad trade. There is significant violence in the book that never made its way into Kubrick\u2019s film, but which very much raises a specter of domestic violence that is terrorizing real people living in real horror stories. There are a few lesser elements. Jack wielded a roque mallet, not an axe. Danny is not interrupted in his travels through the corridors by Arbus-like twin sisters. And the sisters in question are not even twins. There are plenty more, but you get the idea. An interesting film, for sure, but not really the most faithful interpretation of the book. King saw that a film that more closely reflected what he had written reached TV screens in 1997, with a six-hour mini-series version.Irrelevancies of a personal natureThe opening shot was filmed on the  Going\u2013to-the-Sun Road in Montana\u2019s Glacier National Park in Montana. I have had the pleasure (7 times in one visit) and recommend the drive wholeheartedly. It is a pretty narrow road though, so you will have to drive carefully. Bring along the appropriate musical media for the best effect, Wendy Carlos\u2019s Rocky Mountain, and dress warmly. It was below freezing when I reached the top of the road, in August. Some exteriors for Kubrick\u2019s film were shot at the Timberline Lodge on Mount Hood in Oregon. I visited but did not stay there back in 2008. Sadly I do not have any decent personal photos from the place. I can report, though, on a bitThis shot was found on Wikimediaof kitsch. There is a place in the hotel where an ax is lodged in a block of wood, with HEEEEERE\u2019s JOHNNY on the ax, a tourist photo-op. And yes, I did. Sadly, or luckily, the shot did not come out well, so you will be spared.Back to the book, Danny\u2019s talent is a two-edged sword. He is afflicted with seeing more than anyone his age should have to see, but on the other hand, he has a tool he can use to try to save them all. Whether he can or not is a core tension element here. King is fond of placing his stories in literary context. He peppers the text with references to various relevant books and authors. I expect these are meant to let us know his influences. Horace Walpole, author of The Castle of Otranto, a Gothic classic, is mentioned, as is Shirley Jackson, of Hill House fame. King had used a quote from this book in Salem\u2019s Lot. A family saga rich with death and destruction, Cashelmara is mentioned as are some more contemporary items, like The Walton Family, the idealized antithesis to the Torrance Family, Where the Wild Things Are and novelist Frank Norris. The primary literary reference here is Poe\u2019s The Masque of the Red Death, which is cited many times. There had been a costume ball back in hotel\u2019s history and it is the impending climax of that party, the unmasking, that looms here. And toss in nods to Treasure Island and Bluebeard for good measure.King often includes writers in his work, avatars for himself.  I write about writers because I know the territory. Also, you know it's a great job for a protagonist in a book. Without having to hold down a steady job, writers can have all sorts of adventures. Also, if they disappear, it's a long time before they are missed. Heh-heh-heh. \u2013 from an  AOL interview\nJack Torrance is a writer as well as a teacher. The play that Jack is writing undergoes a transformation that mirrors Jack\u2019s own. In fact, there is a fair bit or mirroring going on here. Jack\u2019s affection for his father as a kid was as strong as Danny's is for him. His father was an abusive alcoholic. While Jack is not (yet) the monster his father was, he is also an alcoholic with abusive tendencies.  I never had a father in the house. My mother raised my brother and I alone. I wasn\u2019t using my own history, but I did tap into some of the anger you sometimes feel to the kids, where you say to yourself: I have really got to hold on to this because I\u2019m the big person here, I\u2019m the adult. One reason I wanted to use booze in the book is that booze has a tendency to fray that leash you have on your temper\u2026For a lot of kids, Dad is the scary guy. It\u2019s that whole thing where your mother says, \u2018You just wait until your father comes home!\u201d In The Shining, these people were snowbound in a hotel and Dad is always home! And Dad is fighting this thing with the bottle and he\u2019s got a short temper anyway. I was kind of feeling my own way in that because I was a father of small children. And one of the things that shocked me about fatherhood was it was possible to get angry at your kids. (from the EW interview cited in Extra Stuff)He\u2019s right. I have had the pleasure and I know. Wendy gets some attention as well, as we learn a bit about her mother, and see Wendy\u2019s fear that she has inherited elements of her mother\u2019s awfulness. Not everything shines here. There are times when five-year-old Danny seems much older than his tender years, even given his extraordinary circumstances. It struck me as surprising that there is no mention of anyone suggesting that maybe Jack might attend an AA meeting. But these are like single dead pixels on a large screen.If you want to read horror tales that are straight up scare\u2019ems, there are plenty in the world. But if you appreciate horror that offers underlying emotional content, and I know you do, my special gift tells me that The Shining is a brilliant example of how a master illuminates the darkness.

Heck, it's my favorite novel of his to date, although I have a good number of his books to catch up on. I've found myself overly critical of his work in the past, possibly due to the fact that he's so well known, but I feel it's more been a fault on my end. Previously I've picked up one of his doorstops at a time I wasn't prepared to fully invest in the time and energy it takes to immerse oneself into his world building and lengthy details. This time, I was ready. (Also, this was only like 600 pages which felt like a novella compared to IT.) I'm finally able to understand why so many people hold the standard of traditional horror in comparison to this novel. Sure, it has all the creepy crawlies and spooky wookies to get your heart racing, but it's so grounded in reality that I had a hard time rationalizing with myself that \"it's just a story.\" The 150 page set up is well worth the reader's time, as it lays the groundwork for much of the why behind the narrative, and it also gave me a chance to bond with precious Danny before the shit hit the fan. I may be the last person on the planet to have read this book, but just in case I'm not, I wanted to share some of the things that really hit home with me. Just like IT is, at heart, a disturbing coming-of-age story, The Shining was an impeccable tale of extreme cabin fever with a hefty dose of \"the destructive nature of alcoholism\". When you break it down like that, the supernatural elements actually seem to take a backseat to the very real horror of what it's like living with someone struggling through addiction. I've heard all the stories of how this book helped SK realize his own struggle with alcohol, and I'm inclined to believe it's true as the writing here was heavy laden with emotion and depth. I apologize for ever calling Mr. King over-hyped. I'm grateful my previous experiences with his wordier novels didn't deter me from finally choosing to read this, as it's a gem of a book and a classic in it's genre. I still despise Sleeping Beauties though and refuse to change my opinion on the matter. ;) Highly recommended to any other below-the-rock dwellers who may not have happened across this one. Now- to watch the movie or not?"}, {"userName": "Jeffrey Keeten", "userReviewDate": "Aug 16, 2012", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/3427339-jeffrey-keeten", "userReview": "\u201cThe thought rose from nowhere, naked and unadorned. The urge to tumble her out of bed, naked, bewildered, just beginning to wake up; to pounce on her, seize her neck like the green limb of a young aspen and to throttle her, thumbs on windpipe, fingers pressing against the top of her spine, jerking her head up and ramming it back down against the floorboards, again and again, whamming, whacking, smashing, crashing. Jitter and jive, baby. Shake, rattle, and roll. He would make her take her medicine. Every drop. Every last bitter drop.\u201dFor a guy like myself who loves to read and write taking the job as a winter caretaker of The Overlook Hotel sounds like a dream job.\nThe Stanley Hotel inspiration for The Overlook HotelThe time requirements for the job are miniscule leaving me plenty of time every day to work on the next \u201cgreat American novel\u201d. Before leaving for this foray into isolationism I would calculate just how many books I would need to sustain me through the winter and then increase it by \u2153 or so. Jack Torrance makes the case that because he is an educated man he is better suited for the job. \u201cA stupid man is more prone to cabin fever just as he\u2019s more prone to shoot someone over a card game or commit a spur-of-the-moment robbery. He gets bored. When the snow comes, there\u2019s nothing to do but watch TV or play solitaire and cheat when he can\u2019t get all the aces out. Nothing to do but bitch at his wife and nag at the kids and drink. It gets hard to sleep because there\u2019s nothing to hear. So he drinks himself to sleep and wakes up with a hangover. He gets edgy. And maybe the telephone goes out and the TV aerial blows down and there\u2019s nothing to do but think and cheat at solitaire and get edgier and edgier. Finally...boom, boom, boom.\u201dNow Jack may be an educated man but he is carrying around more baggage than any one bellhop could ever get delivered. He has a double helix of trouble an alcohol problem intertwined with a really nasty temper. He has lost jobs. He has beaten a young man senseless. He has broken his son Danny\u2019s arm, little more than a toddler, because he messed up his papers. Jack is always sorry.\nJack playing JackWhen not drinking he wipes his lips so often he makes them bleed.His father was a violent man and King does give us some background on Jack\u2019s childhood which may have been intended to lend some sympathy for Jack. Just because we follow the threads back to why he is the way he is doesn\u2019t mean that he is anymore likeable or for that matter less dangerous. He may be an educated man, and he may have made the case as to why he is more qualified to be a caretaker cut off from the world, but as it turns out he wasn\u2019t suited for the job, not suited at all. I was sitting in an American English class at the University of Arizona, what seems like an eon ago, when a woman, older than the rest of us by probably 15 years or so, raised her hand and asked the teacher why we weren\u2019t reading Stephen King for this class. I remember distinctly peering at the syllabus and seeing Steinbeck, Faulkner, Hemingway and Fitzgerald among others. It was the canon of American Literature about to be explored by some of us in depth and by some of us only by way of Cliff Notes or Sparks Notes. Some in the class I could almost pick them out by their shiny perfect teeth, which I found abhorrently boring like trees planted in perfect rows, belonged to the Greek Houses and would be showing up to class only to turn in their papers carefully culled from the vast files of papers written by past Sorority Sisters or Fraternity Brothers who had received As in this class for their efforts. After all it isn\u2019t about learning, but about passing. I\u2019m there probably feeling slightly nauseous from the flashing brilliance of pearly whites from the orthodontically challenged when the teacher turns to me and says \u201cJeff why do you think we aren\u2019t teaching King in this class?\u201dHere I am thinking about this woman wanting to wedge King between my literary hero F. Scott Fitzgerald and Ernest Hemingway. I don\u2019t think I\u2019d even read King at this point, but I\u2019d been working in a bookstore for many years and knew how important he was to providing me with a paycheck. He developed cross genre appeal bringing horror forward from being a subspecies of science-fiction and away from residing in a spinner rack of books at the back of the bookstore for those social abnormals dressed all in black. I didn\u2019t really know how to answer the question except in the most bland way possible. I said he hasn\u2019t stood the test of time. I could tell my answer was about as satisfying as a week old bagel to the woman, and I was hampered by the fact that I really didn\u2019t want to insult the woman. The teacher also looked mildly disappointed. I could tell she was hoping to see blood in the water and I failed to be the shark she thought me to be. The woman\u2019s question does show the issue about Stephen King that is debated in most literary circles whether they are a book club down at the local library or the academic break room at a major university. He has legions of fans. He makes millions every time he puts out a new book which feels like four times a year. The problem is he is a genius. He isn\u2019t a genius in the way that Pynchon, Gaddis, or Wallace are geniuses. He is a genius storyteller. So if so many people are reading him he really can\u2019t be any good...can he?Someone on GR made the really good point that Stephen King does not need him to buy and read his books. He has writer friends, below the radar, that need his support more. That is so true and one of the more annoying things about King followers is that a percentage of them don\u2019t read anything else. They would come into the bookstore and hound us for the release date of the next Stephen King. I would sweep my hand grandly through the air and point out several other authors that may fill the time between King novels. They simply were not interested. The thing of it is I used to love being one of those scruffy minded individuals that are always trying to find the next great writer before anyone else. There was no reason to read King because there were no points to be scored with my group of pseudo-intellectual friends by saying something so insipid as \u201cis anyone else reading the new King?\u201dWhen I worked at Green Apple Books in San Francisco, which by the way that city is one of the best reading publics in the United States, we catered to University professors, want-to-be writers, actors, and a slew of other professionals such as doctors, lawyers, and bankers. It was a well educated lot to say the least. I thought my days of selling King were over....wrong. Customers with wire rimmed glasses and elbow patches on their tweed jackets would bring up these academic books so obscure that I had no idea we even had them in the store, and invariably in the pile somewhere would be a Stephen King novel. I was still too caught up in my self-image as a reader to really think about taking a walk with the \u201cnormals\u201d and start reading King, but I was starting to think to myself... hmmm I wonder what\u2019s going on in them thar books?\nRedrum.Murder.Redrum.Murder.(The Red Death held sway over all!)\n\nDanny, Jack\u2019s five year old son, has what one character referred to as \u201ca shine\u201d. If people are thinking about something intently, Danny can read their thoughts. He also has an invisible friend named Tony who can take him places, a bit more elaborate than my invisible friend Beauregard. What a dud he turned out to be. Danny loves his father, actually more than his mother Wendy, which is such a painful realization for her. She has stood in the breach. She DIDN'T break his arm. She protects him from everything including his FATHER. As the malevolent force at the hotel begins to exert more and more influence on Jack and Danny she is relatively unaffected by hallucinatory thoughts. The interesting subtext of this novel is that Jack thinks the hotel is after him. As Danny explains:\u201cIt\u2019s tricking Daddy, it\u2019s fooling him, trying to make him think it wants him the most. It wants me the most, but it will take all of us.\u201dA precocious five year old with a brain of such singular existence that the evil entity of The Overlook Hotel must have him. Another interesting aspect of the book is the fact that most people will not be affected by the ghostly influences of the hotel unless they have an imaginative brain to start with. They must have a mind open enough to hear the voices and realize the possibility that they may be real. Did I mention that I\u2019m not really interested in that job anymore?I know this story. I haven\u2019t watched the movie or read the book previously and yet I\u2019m very familiar with the plot. It didn\u2019t matter.While reading this book I was on the edge of my seat. My pulse rate elevated. My mind buzzing with lizard brain flight or fight responses. This guy King knows how to tell a story. There is this scene on the stairs between Jack and Wendy that is probably one of the most intense fight scenes I\u2019ve ever read in literature. I was right there with the characters feeling the thud of the roque mallet and the grind of my broken ribs. Stephen King is a cultural geek of the first order. He enjoys reading and promoting writers. He is a self-made man. A man blessed and haunted by a vivid imagination. He gets big points from me for mentioning Welcome to Hard Times and also McTeague two books that are members of my favorite obscure literature list. I like it when a writer tells us what his characters are reading. He mentions television shows such as The Avengers, which I loved discovering recently that Honor Blackman (Pussygalore) preceded Diana Rigg on that show, and King also mentions Secret Agent Man starring Peter McGoohan. For the last two years I\u2019ve been sifting through old television shows, thank you NETFLIX, and finding shows that I really like. Besides the two shows King mentioned I\u2019ve also enjoyed watching The Baron starring Steve Forrest and Sue Lloyd and the short episodes of Honey West starring the ocelot Bruce. I also have The Saint queued up starring Roger Moore. I have fond memories of watching that show as a child late at night in the summer time. There has been a hue and cry from his fan base for Stephen King's work to be looked on as literary classics. They feel he is not given the respect he deserves for being a great writer. He is accessible to the average reader, and yet; somehow, puts the right hooks in his writing to please the elevated reader. We do him a disservice, I feel, to try to make him into something he is not. That said, probably the best of King will be read 100 years from now. He is the consummate storyteller still enamored with the unknown and the unknowable. He has a childlike wonder for the world and I for one will make a bigger effort to see the world more often through his eyes.

It scared the hell out of me.Over a period of time, I have noticed certain standard \"motifs\" in horror stories. One of these I call \"The Lost Child\". Such stories will typically involve a child, who can see what the silly grownups cannot see (or, even if they do see, don't acknowledge because it goes against reason and logic): and who fights, however high the odds stacked against him/ her are. Danny Torrance is such a boy.Danny can read minds. He can see the frightening thoughts inside his Dad's and Mom's heads (\"DIVORCE\", \"SUICIDE\") but is powerless to do anything about it. Danny does not know that he has a gift; he takes it as a matter of course, until Dick Halloran of the Overlook Hotel tells him that he \"shines on\".Jack Torrance, Danny's Dad, reformed alcoholic and struggling writer, is trying to put his life back together after a tragedy. He gets what he sees as the ideal chance when he lands the job of caretaker of the Overlook Hotel for the winter. In the snowed-in hotel with only his son and wife Wendy, Jack assumes that he will get enough quality time to be with his family, patch up old quarrels, and write that breakout novel.But the Overlook has other plans. The hotel, which feeds on and grows in strength from the evils committed on its premises, wants Danny-permanently-to join its crew of ghostly inhabitants. And to do that, it needs to get to Jack...The novel slowly grows in horror, starting with mild unease, moving up through sweaty palms and dry mouth, to pure, gut-wrenching terror. Jack's slow slide into madness is paralleled by the growth in power of the hotel's dark miasma, and Danny's extraordinary capabilities. We are on a roller-coaster ride into darkness.The world of grownups is often frighteningly incomprehensible to young children: these fears seldom die as we grow up, but remain dormant in our psyche. There are very few of us who does not have a ghost in our childhood somewhere. It is when the writer invokes this ghost that story gets to us. King does a masterly job of awakening that child, and putting him/ her in the midst of childhood terrors through the alter ego of Danny Torrance, lost in the cavernous corridors of the Overlook.There are a lot of passages which literally creeped me out in this novel (the topiary animals, the fire hose in the corridor, the woman in the bathroom to name a few). As King has said elsewhere, the monster behind the door is more frightening than the monster slavering at you: this book is full of such monsters. More importantly, you will keep on remembering your own boogeymen while you are reading; and long after you finish, you will feel the urge to look behind you.Horror stories are a form of catharsis. As King says, the writer takes you to the body covered under the sheet: you feel it, and are frightened. At the same time, you are relieved that the body is not you.A true masterpiece."}, {"userName": "Elyse", "userReviewDate": "Feb 24, 2018", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/597461-elyse", "userReview": "Ok, Mr. Jack Torrence,..... .....

It's as though he built a haunted house and then filled every nook and cranny with detail. King is also at his best in regard to characterization, all well rounded and complete, we know family relationships, group dynamics, all the old hidden buried fears. King touches base with psychological elements, theological, metaphysical, spiritual, and cryptic aspects of a ghost story to wrap the reader in a blanket of horror.** I watched the 1980 Stanley Kubrik film recently and this made me want to reread the book (which I need to anyway). Kubrik's film grasps the psychological elements of the book and delivers an extra large thin crust The Works pizza of haunted house horror. Jack Nicholson's portrayal of Jack Torrance is still the defining image of this tortured man. While some critics have derided the slow pace of the film (atypical for jump-out-and-yell-BOO! horror fliks of the time) I felt that Kubrik was building the tone and mood of the story to the grisly final moments. King himself has attributed mixed emotions to the film as an adaptation, but has consistently agreed that the imagery of an internal struggle with the dark side of Jack's psyche is a contribution to the horror film genre. King also disagreed with the casting of Nicholson who too closely identified with insanity (due largely to his exceptional work in One Flew Over the Cuckoo's Nest). Interestingly, King himself was battling alcoholism while writing the classic and viewing his work and Kubrik's vision from this perspective adds greater depth to an understanding and appreciation of both."}, {"userName": "Ginger", "userReviewDate": "Oct 18, 2017", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/14097149-ginger", "userReview": "All the stars!Loved, loved this book!I'm not sure what to say in this review that hasn't been said by others. I was blown away by how great this book was. It was so much better then the movie!The slow progression of insanity with Jack Torrance was one of the best things about this book. I loved the overall menacing presence of The Overlook. I loved how the hotel becomes more violent and threatening to Danny and his family the longer they stay there. It was so gripping and overwhelming as the story unfolded. You just couldn't quit reading!I enjoyed Danny's struggle as a kid with understanding his 'gifts' and how to use them in a positive way.Danny, don't you dare go into room 217!This whole book was just awesome! This review doesn't give this book justice for how great it is. I recommend this book to Stephen King fans and horror lovers.One of the best books out there! GO READ IT!"}, {"userName": "Kemper", "userReviewDate": "Sep 22, 2007", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/405390-kemper", "userReview": "Even though the film version of this one from Stanley Kubrick is generally considered a horror classic, Stephen King has never been shy about making his dislike of it known. He hates it so much that he was heavily involved in making a more faithful adaptation of it as TV mini-series in 1997. (This inferior version invited comparisons of Stephen Weber from Wings to one of Jack Nicholson\u2019s most iconic performances. So that worked well\u2026.) Considering Uncle Stevie\u2019s longstanding grudge about it, I was more than a little shocked when he recently made a public plea for fans of Under the Dome to accept the changes that the new TV show was making. I can\u2019t quite wrap my head around why a genius director creating something new and brilliant based on his story is bad, but anything that a fairly shitty TV show does with the source material is A-OK with King?Whatever\u2026.On to the book. As most everyone knows, this is about a family spending the winter in a haunted hotel in the Rocky Mountains called the Overlook. Jack Torrance was a teacher and promising writer, but his alcoholism and short temper wrecked his career and very nearly ended his marriage. Jack has been sober over a year, and he and Wendy have started down the path of reconciliation. However, she can never entirely forgive him for breaking the arm of their son Danny in an incident that was equal parts rage and accident. Five year old Danny has psychic mojo that includes reading thoughts and precognition courtesy of visions shown to him by his imaginary friend, Tony.Nearly broke, Jack takes on the job of being the winter caretaker for the Overlook. This means that the family will spend months alone in the hotel once the snow flies, and the last caretaker went axe-happy and killed his family. Unfortunately, the Overlook is like an emotional sponge that has soaked in every ugly act that ever took place within its rooms, and the presence of a high-powered psychic like Danny kicks the place into overdrive. As Jack is being driven into madness, Wendy and Danny become increasingly terrified of what he might do.I once read something in which King talked about denial of his own substance abuse problems in which he noted that he somehow wrote The Shining without ever once realizing he was describing his own alcoholism. That element of the Jack Torrence character is what makes this one of his better books. The idea of being trapped in a hotel with a bunch of ghosts is scary in a horror story kind of way. The idea of being trapped in a hotel with an ill-tempered drunk with a history of violence as he is cracking up is downright terrifying.Adding even more weight to that idea is that Jack Torrance isn\u2019t a monster. He\u2019s a troubled man who does love his wife and son, and he\u2019s self-aware enough to realize that he\u2019s on the brink. He\u2019ll either turn his life around and earn his wife\u2019s trust back, or he\u2019ll give in to his own worst impulses. This would be hard enough under any circumstances, but under the influence of the evil spirits of the Overlook, Jack becomes a tragedy.Another element jumped out at me while re-reading this time. King talked in his non-fiction Danse Macabre (Which I remember as being entertaining, but probably very dated by now. I would be very interested if Uncle Stevie wanted to take another look at what\u2019s become of the horror genre since he wrote that one.) about the economic factor of The Amityville Horror and how a part of why the movie worked was that the family was essentially trapped by their finances. He uses that idea to good effect here. Most people would run screaming from the Overloook in less than a week, but we\u2019re frequently reminded that the Torrance family was swirling the drain financially. If the perception is that Jack botched this job, his last chance to get back to a more stable lifestyle is probably shot and that goes a long way towards allowing him to convince himself and Wendy that they\u2019re overreacting to the weird occurrences during the early stages, and by the time they\u2019ve become snowed in, the Overlook has its hooks deep into Jack. It\u2019s those more mundane things like a family struggling with money and that an evil entity turns one of them against the others by playing on his inherent weaknesses that make this one of my favorite King novels."}, {"userName": "Fabian", "userReviewDate": "Dec 27, 2008", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/1036893-fabian", "userReview": "His best book is 'The Green Mile,' but since it doesn't quite fall under the Horror category, it is either 'Shining' or 'Carrie' which take top prize.There is not one single detriment to this well-known tale of the disintegration of the American family within the realm of the un-dead. King here is as he has never been since: metaphoric and concise. He usually adds fact upon useless fact that converts a 400 page work into something more gargantuan, &, therefore, less enthralling. King is not a fan of the Kubrick film, and it is easy to see why. His story is about the build up of tension, the \"shining' a catalyst that promotes a bridge between the haunts & the humans. The boiler burns, blows everything up just as Jack Torrence forgets his humanity and becomes an ego/id complex. His selfishness & his alcoholism (a hereditary illness... another theme about family \"curses,\" and weak threads) leads to savagery. The ghosts are the manifestations of a child's bruised home-life and the suffocation and claustrophobia have more to do with that tragic past than the hotel's eerie interior.I place this masterpiece next to 'The Exorcist', a tale that is more than just a simple tale of demonic possession. To say the 'The Shining' is just a ghost story is something Kubrick ran with... completely ignoring the pathos of a family eating away at itself. The Torrences suffer because they had been broken prior to the stay at the Overlook... it seems that for this one all the stars aligned and all the ingredients for one of the most amazing horror stories of all time mixed exquisitely. This one was the one that made King king."}, {"userName": "Stephen", "userReviewDate": "Aug 17, 2008", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/1413439-stephen", "userReview": "QUESTION: Is Stephen King the BEST PURE STORYTELLER of the 20th Century ?ANSWER: Who knows...I haven\u2019t got the slightest wisp of the faintest fragment of a lingering shadow of a clue how to answer that manwich-sized question. However, I do think that in order to have a credible debate on the subject, you would need to include the Prince of the Prolific Page Turner in the argument. That says something to me and it got me thinking that there is a lot to like (and even love) about much of King\u2019s work. Calm down King haters, this is not going to be a slobbering \u201crah rah\u201d session, but I do think some due is due to Mr. King and his extensive literary production. But, first, a little background.  MY EARLY LIFE WITH STEPHEN KING AND READINGLike many, I read a lot of King\u2019s early novels when I was a prepubescent and post pubescent teenager and enjoyed them a lot at the time. I mean they had lots of naughty words and naughty people doing naughty things (sometimes to their naughty bits)...what\u2019s not to love sports fans. During that period I read quite a few Kingers including: The Stand,Firestarter,The Dead Zone,Night Shift,Cujo (OUCH on this epic failure),The Gunslinger,Christine andPet Sematary. However, after the The Drawing of the Three (more on that series below), I drifted away from reading in general as other things began to take precedence in my advancing teen years...namely...girls, college, drinking, parties, drinking with girls at college parties...oh yeah, studying...more drinking, studying while drinking, the beach, more parties, studying (or pretending to study) with girls, more drinking...[censored]...raging parties...OH SHIT HERE COMES LAW SCHOOL...sadness...much less drinking, lots more studying.This period of literary latency lasted about 15 years (though I did still read during this time, but it was very sporatic). Then about 7 years ago, I began hard core reading again like a born again bibliophile. This hot, steamy love of books soon blossomed into an uncontrollable addiction once I joined Goodreads (YES, THAT MAKES ALL OF YOU READING THIS ENABLERS!!!). Well, once I reattached myself to the reading world, my primary King-related focus was completing the Dark Tower series in all its delicious awesomeness. WARNING: Fanboy gusher about to commence. Leaving aside the rest of his catalog, if SK had written nothing but the Dark Tower series, he would be on my shortlist of favorite authors of all time. The Dark Tower is one of my All Time Favorite series and is head, shoulders, navel, twig and berries above anything else King has ever done. In addition to being one of the most well-imagined, compelling and fantastically realized series ever written, I believe its staggering uniqueness places it among the greatest literary achievements of the 20th Century\u2026PERIOD. I know,I know there are some that don\u2019t agree with this and...well...they are just wrong. It happens and I\u2019m sorry for your wrongness.Okay, so after finishing the Dark Tower for the 2nd time (I am currently up to book 4 on my 3rd go around with the Dark Tower Group here on GR), I decided to read some of King\u2019s later works that I missed as well as go back and revisit the stories I read as a teenager (to see how they hold up to the memory of my hormonally controlled younger self). THE SHININGWhich brings us to the Shining which was first up on my re-read list and I am happy to say that I found this more enjoyable this time around. Most of this is due to subtle and nuanced psychological aspects of the novel dealing with alcohlism, obsession and madness were more understandable and relatable at 40 than they were at 15 (go figure). I also found myself thinking of this story as a pretty good microcosm of King\u2019s work (both the good and the bad) as it contained many of King's strength and weaknesses. While I assume most people are familiar with the plot, for those just returning to Earth (welcome back) or just arriving for the first time (NaNu..NaNu), the plot centers around aspiring writer Jack Nicholson Torrance who has accepted the job of winter caretaker for the Overlook Hotel (aka\u2026the most EVIL place on Earth). Now, Jackie boy is a charmer. He is a \u201cnot so recovering\u201d alcoholic with serious \"pole up the poop shoot\" anger issues and a MEGATRON-sized problem with authority. Basically, he is your basic angry, violent, anti-social drunk...let's go ahead and call him DADDY. Accompanying Daddy to the OverSPOOK Hotel are his wife, Wendy, and their \u201cclairvoyant\u201d son Danny, whose unique ability is called The Shining. Now Daddy is hoping to use the quiet time at the OverKOOK to help suture his relationship with his family which, oddly enough, has been on the downslide since Daddy broke Danny\u2019s arm during some drunken shenanigans. UH, I don\u2019t think I need to tell you that things do not go well for Daddy or his family once they come under the influence of the Over\"Look we just want to kill you\" Hotel. I think I will exit the plot summary and leave the rest for you to find on your own.  MY THOUGHTSI really liked the story. King does a great job of creating a superb sense of dread with sides of creepy and crawly in this very unique and layered \"haunted house\" story. For all of King\u2019s less than perfect prose, his occassional LONG \"off the plot\" tangents and a few endings that leave something to be desired...like a good ending... for all of that SK is an extraordinary story-teller. He is among the best ever at being able to suck a reader into his story and the Shining is certainly a great example of that as I was lost in the narrative from the very beginning. There are few writers who can completing yank me into a story and have me forgeting about eating and sleeping like King did here. For example, I was listening to the audio version of this novel (narrated very well by actor Campbell Scott) and I have rarely had 16+ hours of an audio book sail by as fast as this one did. Now understand, I thought the story was very good but was nowhere near loving it. Yet, I found myself listening to it almost straight through, because King has some demon-spawned story-telling mojo that hypnotizes me. Oddly enough, an hour after I finished the story I was actually somewhat unfulfilled\u2026it\u2019s like the book is some form of literary Chinese food. Regardless, while I was listening I was captivated and this seems to be one of King\u2019s gifts. The ability to create characters that engage the reader (both good and bad) and finding the right emotional buttons to press in order to make the reader CARE about what his characters are thinking and doing. King certainly succeeds here and is in top \"page turning\" form as he employs characters that are exceptionally well drawn, including the Hotel itself which is one of the best non-human characters ever. Overall, I think King has created a classic, yet unique \u201chaunted house\u201d story while at the same time including an engaging and evocative depiction of obsession, alcoholism and madness. A good, solid story that is worth reading. 4.0 stars."}, {"userName": "Evgnossia O'Hara", "userReviewDate": "May 30, 2018", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/43416866-evgnossia-o-hara", "userReview": "\u039a\u03b1\u03c4\u03b1\u03c0\u03bb\u03b7\u03ba\u03c4\u03b9\u03ba\u03cc! \u0394\u03b5\u03bd \u03b2\u03b1\u03c1\u03ad\u03b8\u03b7\u03ba\u03b1 \u03bf\u03cd\u03c4\u03b5 \u03c3\u03c4\u03b9\u03b3\u03bc\u03ae! \u0397 \u03c0\u03bb\u03bf\u03ba\u03ae \u03ba\u03c5\u03bb\u03bf\u03cd\u03c3\u03b5 \u03c3\u03b1\u03bd \u03bd\u03b5\u03c1\u03ac\u03ba\u03b9. \u0391\u03b4\u03c5\u03bd\u03b1\u03bc\u03af\u03b1 \u03bc\u03bf\u03c5 \u03b2\u03ad\u03b2\u03b1\u03b9\u03b1 \u03ae\u03c4\u03b1\u03bd \u03bf \u039d\u03c4\u03ac\u03bd\u03b9, \u03c4\u03bf \u03c0\u03b5\u03bd\u03c4\u03b1\u03c7\u03c1\u03bf\u03bd\u03bf \u03b1\u03b3\u03cc\u03c1\u03b9 \u03c0\u03bf\u03c5 \u03c0\u03ad\u03c1\u03b1\u03c3\u03b5 \u03b1\u03c0\u03cc \u03c0\u03c1\u03b1\u03b3\u03bc\u03b1\u03c4\u03b9\u03ba\u03ae \u03ba\u03cc\u03bb\u03b1\u03c3\u03b7. \u03a4\u03b9\u03c2 \u03c4\u03b5\u03bb\u03b5\u03c5\u03c4\u03b1\u03af\u03b5\u03c2 250 \u03c3\u03b5\u03bb. \u03c4\u03b9\u03c2 \u03b4\u03b9\u03ac\u03b2\u03b1\u03c3\u03b1 \u03c7\u03c9\u03c1\u03af\u03c2 \u03bd\u03b1 \u03b1\u03c6\u03ae\u03c3\u03c9 \u03c4\u03bf \u03b2\u03b9\u03b2\u03bb\u03af\u03bf \u03b1\u03c0\u03cc \u03c4\u03b1 \u03c7\u03ad\u03c1\u03b9\u03b1 \u03bc\u03bf\u03c5. \u0394\u03b5\u03bd \u03bc\u03c0\u03bf\u03c1\u03bf\u03cd\u03c3\u03b1 \u03bd\u03b1 \u03ba\u03bf\u03b9\u03bc\u03b7\u03b8\u03ce \u03c0\u03c1\u03b9\u03bd \u03c6\u03c4\u03ac\u03c3\u03c9 \u03c3\u03c4\u03bf \u03c4\u03ad\u03bb\u03bf\u03c2 \u03ba\u03b1\u03b9 \u03c0\u03c1\u03b1\u03b3\u03bc\u03b1\u03c4\u03b9\u03ba\u03ac \u03ac\u03be\u03b9\u03b6\u03b5. \u03a4\u03bf \u03c4\u03ad\u03bb\u03bf\u03c2 \u03bc\u03b5 \u03b2\u03c1\u03ae\u03ba\u03b5 \u03bc\u03b5 \u03b4\u03ac\u03ba\u03c1\u03c5\u03b1. \u0391\u03bd\u03c5\u03c0\u03bf\u03bc\u03bf\u03bd\u03ce \u03bd\u03b1 \u03b4\u03b9\u03b1\u03b2\u03ac\u03c3\u03c9 \u03ba\u03b1\u03b9 \u03ac\u03bb\u03bb\u03b1 \u03b2\u03b9\u03b2\u03bb\u03af\u03b1 \u03c4\u03bf\u03c5 Stephen King \u03c0\u03bf\u03c5 \u03b5\u03af\u03bd\u03b1\u03b9 \u03bf \u03b2\u03b1\u03c3\u03b9\u03bb\u03b9\u03ac\u03c2 \u03c4\u03bf\u03c5 \u03b5\u03af\u03b4\u03bf\u03c5\u03c2! \u03a4\u03bf\u03c5\u03bb\u03ac\u03c7\u03b9\u03c3\u03c4\u03bf\u03bd \u03c3\u03b5 \u03b1\u03c5\u03c4\u03cc \u03c4\u03bf \u03b2\u03b9\u03b2\u03bb\u03af\u03bf.\u0391\u03bd\u03c4\u03b5 \u03bd\u03b1 \u03b4\u03c9 \u03c0\u03c9\u03c2 \u03b8\u03b1 \u03ba\u03bf\u03b9\u03bc\u03b7\u03b8\u03ce \u03c4\u03ce\u03c1\u03b1."}, {"userName": "Hannah Greendale", "userReviewDate": "Oct 30, 2017", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/43377498-hannah-greendale", "userReview": "Click here to watch a video review of this book on my channel, From Beginning to Bookend.

That's where it's at. This is a high point in the King canon for me. In Salem's Lot before this, he developed fascinating characters inhabited a beautifully described small town. He took his time slowly unraveling the story, taking pages and pages to build the setting and deepen our relationship with the large cast of characters. In The Shining, there are basically three characters outside of a small cast of supporting actors. The setting is really just a giant old hotel in a snowy Colorado town. But SK takes even more pages, sometimes entire blasted chapters to develop his characters and set his scenes. Like I said before, it's a slow burn, man. The fact that King takes his time building the horror makes the scary scenes that much scarier. It's not a horror novel full of jump scares and monsters. It's effective by drawing us deep into the minds of the characters, overhearing their innermost thoughts, and freaking out right along with them. The scenes there for horror effect and the iconic stuff from the movie aren't even all that necessary. There is so much else going on in the isolation, addition, desperation, schizophrenia of it all that plays so much harder on your emotions than what's hiding behind a hotel room door. It's long winded at times, sure, but it's mostly necessary. We get to know the Torrence family better than we wish we ever did by the end of this thing. From the awkwardness of the initial conversation with Jack and Ullman to the wild and crazy climax, the pages keep turning and your heart keeps pounding faster. King takes you on a long roller coaster ride that moves slowly up the long, high incline before bringing us crashing down screaming our faces off at the end. And then we grab another King book and hope the ride is just as thrilling as the one before. I'm looking at you, Doctor Sleep."}, {"userName": "Delee", "userReviewDate": "Mar 23, 2012", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/6168268-delee", "userReview": "Delee?Yes Danny...Do you feel bad?No Danny, I just really hated your performance in the movie version of THE SHINING.Really Delee?Yes Danny, I hated it more than anything else in the whooole wiiiiide woooorld.I know this is supposed to be a review of the novel THE SHINING, and not the movie...but I can't review the book on its own. I tried...I really did.I first read THE SHINING just before the movie came out on video- some time in the 80s- because usually if I watch the movie first, it is very rare that I go back and read the book- I remember liking it quite a bit, but over the years the movie and the book seemed to have blended into each other in my head. I had only read the book once...but I have watched the movie zillions of times. (okay maybe not zillions...but a lot). Stanley Kubrick version of THE SHINING is visually stunning- no doubt about it- you can tell that Kubrick was a photographer first and foremost. That is what I love about it, and why I go back and watch it over and over again...but character wise he failed miserably. Danny was horrible- The finger talking , and the voice of Tony made me cringe. Movie Wendy (Shelley Duvall-) was sad, weak and pathetic, and Jack Nicholson- as Jack Torrance made the character crazy right from the get go. I never once believed that Jack ever loved his wife and son.Kubrick also took out much of the supernatural in the movie, making it more of a mental breakdown of Jack's character, than influence from a haunted hotel. So for anyone thinking that because they watched the movie, they know the book. They are dead wrong.I went back and re-read THE SHINING after reading Dr. Sleep- the sequel, and continuation of Danny Torrance's life. I decided it was time to once again re-visit Danny's childhood. There was so much I had forgotten and mixed up having watched the movie so many times.The novel follows Jack Torrance, a recovering alcoholic and writer. After losing his teaching job, Jack decides to accept a position as the caretaker of the Overlook Hotel during the off season. Coming with him are- Wendy- his wife, and Danny- his five year old son (who has psychic abilities). After a winter storm cuts the family off from the outside world- evil forces from the hotel's past, and Jack's own troubled history- start to drive him slowly insane- leaving Wendy, Danny, and Jack in incredible danger.Stephen King wrote THE SHINING when he was in his late twenties and still in his drinking phase. I think that Jack Torrance was the closest King ever came to writing his own true persona from those years, and I can see why he was so disturbed with Kubrick's interpretation. Gone was the strong beautiful wife, gone was the gifted, smart and lovable son, and gone was the sympathetic main character who tried so hard to redeem himself.Suspenseful, thrilling and terrifying- this was a fabulous read...even the second time around."}, {"userName": "Kai", "userReviewDate": "Apr 03, 2015", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/41788524-kai", "userReview": "\"The world's a hard place. It don't care. It don't hate you and me but it don't love us, either.\"My relationship with horror stories is a weird one. I hate them, but my fascination for them always overpowers that feeling. It may take me ages to pick up a certain book or watch a certain movie but at some point curiosity always kills the cat (and satisfaction brings it back.)The only Stephen King I've read before is Carrie. I didn't find it either really frightening or exciting, but it was good. And I just knew that The Shining would be on a whole new level. So it was.The foreshadowing was the worst. It held me tight in its grip and nearly crushed me. On the other hand it made the story predictable.Apart from that I'm fascinated by how amazingly well created the characters are. Same thing applies to background details like the hotels history, its former owners and guests.King also leaves many questions about the hotel unanswered, which is equal parts torture and genius. That's something I really love about authors: when they don't spill all the secrets, so you'll never totally let go of the book.Find more of my books on Instagram"}, {"userName": "Brad", "userReviewDate": "Mar 25, 2008", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/1022982-brad", "userReview": "Once upon a time, there was a young man who believed that books were always better than movies. Everyone whose opinion he respected told him it was so, and he believed it must be. And for a time he saw nothing to shake this belief. He read Dickens and saw filmed versions and knew it was so. He read Dumas and no version of Musketeers could shake his conviction. Wuthering Heights, Pride and Prejudice, and Scarlet Pimpernel all bore this out. But the young man discovered that it wasn't just the classics for which this held true. He read the popular books of his day, the mysteries and science fictions and fantasies, and those were always better than the movie. But the inevitable happened. One day his notions were challenged in the most devastating way. A man, wild with isolated madness, chopped a door down, poked his head through the cracks and declared his frightening presence. It was an iconic moment. A new idol to replace the idol he'd worshipped, but he didn't know it yet. The young man went out to read the book that gave birth to that image, knowing that the book MUST be better than the film. He turned the pages with excitement, and it began as he expected it would. Tension built, suspense drove him on, the characters seemed fuller and richer, but that began to slip away. Where was the thematic depth? Where was the powerful iconography? Where was the terror? It was gone, and with it his notions.Suddenly there was a film that was better than the book. By a long distance. And it was happening everywhere around him. On screen Replicants beat their written counterparts. Russian poets in frozen manors moved him in ways the translated words couldn't. Christs made love to Magdalenes and it made him weep for joy. The truth was other. Rare though it remained, movies could be better than their sources. He would never again be the snob he'd been. He would embrace those films that trumped their books, and proclaim it to the world."}, {"userName": "Carmen", "userReviewDate": "Mar 27, 2015", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/25353295-carmen", "userReview": "[having a rational conversation with it and talking it down.

Empezar la rese\u00f1a con esta l\u00ednea es ponerme la placa de snob grande, roja y en negritas en mi peque\u00f1a frente, pero en realidad no va por ese lado, va por mis propios problemas con King. Dado que comenc\u00e9 siendo un poco \u00e1cida voy a tratar de decir en principio todo aquello que me gust\u00f3. Si hay algo con lo que King siempre tiene un ganar-ganar es con el desarrollo de personaje, es un escritor que no teme quemar p\u00e1ginas y p\u00e1ginas en describir a sus personajes de una manera poco obvia, con la sutileza necesaria para hacernos creer que estamos descubriendo los aspectos m\u00e1s secretos y profundos de cada personaje, cuando en realidad \u00e9l nos va llevando de la mano a cada paso, para que no encontremos algo esencial de cada personaje antes del momento necesario para la trama, pero que sigue siendo algo acorde con la naturaleza del mismo, no parece un aspecto de s\u00ed mismo metido con calzador sino que toda la estructura de la historia hace que sea algo que simplemente embone.Otra cosa que a este autor se le da de una forma que da envidia son la ideas, realmente creo que pocas personas pueden presumir de tener una imaginaci\u00f3n tan desarrollada; este libro es del tipo que no te muestra la m\u00e1s grande innovaci\u00f3n en el terreno literario, pero la forma en que se desarrolla es lo que causa intriga, lo que cubre de una capa de frescor una concepci\u00f3n que la cultura popular a\u00f1ejo a\u00f1os antes de la existencia de este libro; el terror que se busca crear es de tipo envolvente, primeramente nos plantan la duda, posteriormente King nos ofrece migajas, y al final nos da un cierre que simplemente compacta todo ello. Pero no todo es miel sobre hojuelas, si bien la historia es una que se desarrolla de una manera bastante buena el libro tiene ritmo terriblemente malo, y no es porque la narraci\u00f3n sea lenta, se agradece que el autor se tome su tiempo para llegar al cl\u00edmax, pero f\u00e1cilmente se pueden quitar 100 p\u00e1ginas que son meramente relleno, y no de la clase que aporta a los personajes o da profundidad a la historia sino del que \u00fanicamente hace que haya m\u00e1s p\u00e1ginas para leer, p\u00e1ginas que no aportan nada, que est\u00e1n ah\u00ed con el \u00fanico objetivo de retrasar la acci\u00f3n. Si a esto le sumo la man\u00eda de King de cambiar el foco de la historia cuando est\u00e1 ya se encuentra en el punto m\u00e1s \u00e1lgido para mi entras en un v\u00f3rtice del que no se puede salir, que termina tirando hacia abajo la trama dado que pierde la fuerza, incluso la atenci\u00f3n que se ten\u00eda con la resoluci\u00f3n va reduci\u00e9ndose conforme se acerca y se aleja del ojo del hurac\u00e1n.Y mi otro problema recae en la vuelta de tuerca del final, la caricaturizaci\u00f3n del ente due\u00f1o del hotel para mi simplemente dio al traste con todo, dejo de importarme el buen trabajo en la narraci\u00f3n, la honda interiorizaci\u00f3n de los personajes y del hotel, e incluso la manera en que concluir\u00eda, simplemente para mi fue como si de una patada me sacaran de la fantas\u00eda.Al final creo que es un imprescindible si eres fan del autor, pero no lo consider\u00f3 ese imprescindible en la biblioteca del terror."}, {"userName": "Bradley", "userReviewDate": "Mar 25, 2013", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/4213258-bradley", "userReview": "Back in the day when I read this, years ago, I thought it was pretty good but not fantastic. I went ahead and went through all of SK's movies, too, and remembered watching Jack Nicholson in his iconic crazy and thought to myself, \"Hey! This guy is freaking crazy! I love it!\"And now. I saw the Ready Player One movie with so many scenes right from that old film and had to rewatch the original Kubrick film and read the original novel again for *very* good measure since I'm back on an SK kick.I watched that movie a few days ago and thought to myself, \"This is a really bad movie. I still think that Jack is pretty awesome, but no matter how cool he is, it can't save this film.\"And then I read the original book, keeping in mind what SK's thoughts were on the Kubrick film, as remembered so iconically through RPO. He despised it. And as I read The Shining, trying to keep an open mind, I realized something.The Shining is Really, Really Good. Gorgeous details, imagery that blows me away, thoroughly amazing characterization, depth, beauty, and such a great rising unease. I loved Jack in the book. I loved Danny in the book. I loved Halloran in the book. Wendy had a moment or two. But what I loved the most was the Hotel and all its creepy secrets, its depth, its horror. You might say the worldbuilding in this was something pretty damn amazing. And then it hit me.The Kubrick film is a dumpster fire trapped in a bubbling lake of poo.It CRAPPED ON EVERYTHING that made the book great!!!!!Jack in the book went nuts, sure, but the underlying message that \"normal\" novelists writing \"normal\" books are inherently batshit insane in comparison to \"horror\" novelists is as clear as day!Seriously, there's enough story in this book to choke an ox and put any mainstream novel to shame. Because let's face it, SK shows more talent for mainstream fiction in this book than the majority of mainstream fiction, and he's just going to burn the whole house down! :) MUAHAHAHAHAHAHAHA!Just do me a favor, folks, and skip any screened production of this novel and stick with the text.

But can even his son Danny's special gift, The Shining, stop him from going mad and butchering his family like other caretakers before him?Yes, I'm several decades late to the party in reading this but after reading Joe Hill's NOS4A2, I had to read my first non-Dark Tower Stephen King book in years to see how the old man did horror back in the day. I'm not sure this was such a good idea.This book isn't very long but felt like it took a few ice ages for anything to happen. Sure, there were some creepy parts, most of them involving Jack or Danny and the Overlook's ghosts. I think if I hadn't seen the movie first, the book would have been much more enjoyable for me.I think the advantage the movie has over the book is that a third of the time isn't spent delving into Jack Torrance's past. In the movie, we know he's balanced precariously on the razor's edge of madness the first instant we see him and no one in their right mind would want to spend any length of time locked up with him. In the book, we witness the downhill slide for hundreds of pages.

After 338 pages / two thirds of the book, I decided life's too short to waste on books I don't enjoy.If you want sinister snow, I suggest The Castle instead. PotentialThe basic plot (family alone and cut-off in spooky house) may not be original, but it started off quite intriguingly, with more literal demons of alcohol, cycles of abusive parenting (one physical, one emotional), and a lonely only child trying to understand the perplexities adult world. The fact the child, five-year old Danny, can read minds and has hallucinations and premonitions makes the gap between what he sees/knows and understands all the greater. The love a child can feel for an abuser is a strong theme early on: \"Jack had loved him for as long as he was able, long after the rest of the family could only hate and fear him\", and he's terrified of alienating Danny. Similarly, Wendy's troubled relationship with her jealous mother is echoed in the way she envies Danny's closeness to his father.Jack, is a recovering alcoholic, still struggling to stay on the wagon (I assume he gives in later in the book), and although he's never had any paranormal experiences before, he seems to experience some here. Or maybe it's clinical. What's the difference between paranormal (Danny) and \"real\" but distorted perception (Jack)?There were also nods to Alice in Wonderland (indirect) and Bluebeard (explicitly). All these ideas could be fascinating and disturbing, but they didn't really go anywhere, especially after things started jumping out at them.Join the DotsOnce the family were alone in the Overlook Hotel, it became increasingly and infuriatingly formulaic: the build up to something scary, then the relief of everyone pulling through with only minor damage, then the next something scary - perhaps a variant on a previous one, or maybe something new - each one just slightly worse than the previous, interspersed with the odd false alarm. The scary things included all the obvious ones and... actually I can't think of any non-obvious ones, but maybe they come in the final third of the book.All this was interspersed by lazy exposition of what should have been interesting backstory: the dirty dealings in the hotel (organised crime, prostitutes, murder) were revealed by a convenient scrap book, and Jack and Wendy's inner struggles with their own parents and with each other are explained like an introductory psychology primer: Jack wondered if the reason he did X was because Y. SHOW, don't tell!LanguageThere were plenty of weak clich\u00e9s (\"His pride was all that was left\", a child feeling like a puppet in adult games, Danny being the key to everything - just like the key in a clock) and several weird typos and missing words.On the other hand, I really laughed at this description of a lift/elevator, that \"wheezed vibratoriously up the shaft\"!REDRUMDanny keeps seeing and hearing this, and he knows it's bad and scary. But it's a Mystery. With a capital M. The revelation of what and why it meant was the final straw for me: such an anti-climax, and it doesn't even make sense in the way it's described.Why I Read This - and Why I (almost certainly) Won't Read King AgainOne of the things I enjoy about GR is the way it has broadened my reading (and deepened it, too). There are many wonderful books I've read purely because friends with similar tastes have raved about them (Stoner in particular). I gradually noticed quite a few friends whose literary tastes overlap with mine rate King quite highly as a writer. I began to question my avoidance of horror and King, and canvassed advice as to which to read. I wanted to enjoy this - to find a new writer and genre to enjoy, and to prove I should have read King sooner. Perhaps that's why I stuck with it as long as I did (that, and residual guilt from childhood indoctrination never to give up on a book). Even Jack, who wanted to write a book about the hotel, skimmed the scrapbook, so that mitigates my guilt a little.I'm still grateful for the advice about reading King. The fact I've confirmed that King isn't for me is useful knowledge, which is an improvement on uninformed prejudice.

At his left hand was a bowl for peanuts \u2013 now empty, of course. The first bar he\u2019d been in for nineteen months and the damned thing was dry \u2013 just his luck. All the same, a bitterly powerful wave of nostalgia swept over him, and the physical craving for a drink seemed to work itself up from his belly to his throat to his mouth and nose, shriveling and wrinkling the tissues as it went, making them cry out for something wet and long and cold.A lot of terrifying things occur in The Shining. None of them are as terrifying as the excruciating battle fought between the ears of an alcoholic. Stephen King\u2019s novel is a classic ghost story; it is also a painful portrait of a man\u2019s mental breakdown. That man is Jack Torrance, a gifted writer who has squandered his talent with booze and a bad temper. He and his family \u2013 wife Wendy, young son Danny \u2013 are wintering at the Overlook, a hotel in the Colorado mountains with a long and checkered past. Jack has been given a job as the caretaker of the Overlook. It\u2019s his last chance to make good after losing a teaching position at a prestigious prep school. All he has to do is keep the rooms heated, provide basic upkeep, and make minor repairs. He thinks the job will give him plenty of time to finish the play he has been laboring on. The only trick is the isolation. Once the snows move in, they will make the winding mountain roads impassable. The Overlook will be cut off. It\u2019s the perfect spot to do some writing, go homicidally crazy, or both. The genius of The Shining is the simplicity of its setting. Isolated location. Spirit infested living accommodations. Precocious child. All these story elements are exceedingly familiar. Layered onto this foundation is King\u2019s exploration of Jack\u2019s increasingly fragile psyche. King is at the height of his powers in his evocation of Jack. He makes visceral the taste of crushed aspirin, the piercing headaches, the desperate thirst for a drink. Jack is a complex character, at once a loving husband, a doting father, a grade-A prick, and a self-destructive wreck. King is known for outsized epics with dozens of characters. Here, he pares things down to four main players. Besides Jack there are Wendy, Danny, and Dick Hallorann, the Overlook\u2019s chef. King cleverly utilizes a third-person limited viewpoint, which allows him a tell the story through several eyes, giving him the ability to both widen and narrow the focus at his whim.After Jack, Danny is the most important figure. He has \u201cthe shine\u201d, a kind of ESP that includes mental telepathy, sensitivity to the paranormal, mind reading, and the gift of prophecy. (The ability to predict the future is not his best talent, though. If it was, the story would have turned out differently). Danny\u2019s abilities allow him to perceive the danger of the Overlook Hotel \u2013 and its poisonous effect on his father \u2013 long before anyone else. I think King\u2019s major achievement is the way he grounds the weirdness in reality. He is methodical in building this limited world (the Overlook, the town of Sidewinder) and sketching its handful of characters. His plotting takes a bit of time, but there is a reason. Take, for instance, an early scene in which Jack and Wendy take Danny to a psychiatrist. The upshot is that the psychiatrist gives a mushy-mumbly diagnosis of Danny\u2019s \u201cspecial\u201d abilities that momentarily soothes his parents. It\u2019s a scene that could easily have been excised, since it\u2019s clear the doctor is wrong, and it\u2019s obvious that Danny\u2019s abilities are beyond rational explanation. The value of keeping it, though, is that it more firmly roots the proceedings in the actual world. Eventually, King cuts loose and unleashes all manner of insanity. Some of it, frankly, is a bit goofy. However, all the work he has done setting up his endgame paid off. I believed so much that I didn't bat an eye once the hotel came \u2013 for lack of a better phrase \u2013 to life. The Shining is a slow simmering tale that eventually explodes in the unrestrained violence and gore that has made King wealthy beyond imagining. (Of course, compared to some of his other titles, The Shining is practically subtle). The ending is something that is foreshadowed early on; unlike the producers of Friends, I will not spoil it for those who\u2019ve managed to avoid learning it. I\u2019m not sure I\u2019m a huge fan of how King concludes things, but I liked the lead-up so much that I can let that pass. I appreciated the slow turning of the screws, the gradual accretion of detail, the building of tension before it all boils over. I suppose a brief mention of Kubrick\u2019s famous movie version is in order. I\u2019ve heard that King hated it, and I can totally see why. Jack Nicholson plays Jack Torrance as already half-crazy by the time the title card is shown. It\u2019s hard to take his portrayal seriously when his eyes are screaming I\u2019m a psycho! from the very first scene. The film version of Jack Torrance is an exercise in Jack Nicholson seeing if he can out-Jack Nicholson himself. (He does). I like Kubrick\u2019s The Shining, for its formal brilliance if nothing more. The novel, as is often the case, is far superior. The book version of Jack Torrance is far different from his cinematic shadow. He begins as a deeply flawed man with an ugly past, a serious addiction, and a nasty streak a mile wide. But he is also a man who loves \u2013 or believes he loves \u2013 his wife and child. You see flashes of a good man, a man you don\u2019t want to see destroyed. The erosion of Jack\u2019s mind and soul is The Shining\u2019s narrative backbone. King paints an indelible portrait. Jack chewing Excedrin after Excedrin. Jack wiping his lips till they bleed. Jack trying to distract himself from the thought of a drink. Jack trying to reconcile the man he wanted to be with the man he has demonstrated to the world. This is a fully realized and unforgettable character. It\u2019s an accomplishment, and a testament to King\u2019s skill. A skill, perhaps, that is sometimes overlooked. I am slowly making my way through Stephen King\u2019s extensive canon. So far, my favorite has been Pet Semetery, where King uses a ghoulish conceit (an Indian burial ground that can bring the dead back to life) to explore a very real human concern (loss and grief). He touched such powerful chords with that book that I hesitate to ever open it again. It\u2019s becoming very clear to me that King is a genius. An artist of the first order. Not just a top-notch storyteller. Not just a guy with an incredible imagination. But a bona fide literary master. He writes things that you read and don\u2019t forget, ever. A lot of wacky and macabre things happen at the Overlook during the course of The Shining. The tension, the shocks, the slow revelation of the lurking terror, are all things that will keep you turning pages with increasing rapidity. It is also the reason that The Shining (along with King\u2019s other works) is so obviously translatable to film. But the reason this is unforgettable is the framework that King builds upon. The horror of the supernatural is not nearly so deep and so dread as that which passes between flawed human beings."}, {"userName": "F", "userReviewDate": "Apr 16, 2012", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/8161922-f", "userReview": "Really creepy!

I appreciated how the characters were introduced, but this book probably gained an extra star from me for simply being about Colorado. I loved the set up of the empty hotel, where known events could be pictured by characters in the location where they happened. This aspect made the reality of seeing ghosts more real to my skeptical nature, but it wasn\u2019t enough. I tried to scare myself with this book but was unaffected. I would read late at night, all alone, hoping I would have trouble going to sleep, but when I got in bed the only things troubling me were the election and my last muffed stroke on a golf course.

I could think of no better author than The Master of Horror himself for my introduction into this genre.Of course, I have seen the movie version of The Shining years ago. Only vague details remained clogged in my memory from that experience, but not much else. So, I went into this with as little knowledge as possible for such a popular book. I believe this helped me enjoy the story more and let the buildup to the more frightening scenes have better effect. Not that I was ever truly frightened\u2026\u2026honest, but I was severely creeped out a few times. Stephen King just has that knack for setting up a scene to get the most shock value out of it. There was a few times I was like, yeah, that\u2019s not that scary. But by the end of the scene I\u2019m on the edge of my seat screaming run, run, damn you.\n\nIt was the place he had seen in the midst of the blizzard, the dark and booming place where some hideously familiar figure sought him down long corridors carpeted with jungle. The place Tony had warned him against. It was here. It was here. Whatever Redrum was, it was here.\n\n I believe what makes this story so relatable are the characters and some of the events that take place. They could be from any normally dysfunctional family, and many of us have experienced some kind of paranormal activity. Of course, not to the extreme point that is in this book, but even a small paranormal experience can be disturbing. Bye the way, the next time I see animal shrubs, I will be turning around and going the opposite direction. Or I\u2019m going in with a Ghostbusters proton pack strapped on my back. That\u2019s the only way.\nFinal Thoughts\nGoing into this book I had always wondered why the book was named The Shining. I don\u2019t remember the movie ever explaining this, but like I said, it has been years since I watched it. Needless to say that question was put to bed early and was a main focal point in the story.Why only 4 stars? Well, for my first horror novel I didn\u2019t really have anything else to compare this to. I really enjoyed the book, but I wasn\u2019t really satisfied with the ending. Everything was wrapped well enough, but I just had a few issues. I won\u2019t go into detail for fear of spoilers, but that is why this didn\u2019t get the full 5 stars. I\u2019m glad I picked The Shining to get me started in this genre. Although, I won\u2019t take all the credit. My good GR buddy Craig had a role to play in that as well. So, hats off to you mate for the excellent recommendation. I would most definitely recommend this to readers out there who have not delved into this genre before. And those of you that have\u2026why have you not read this yet? I will be adding the horror genre to my favorites list, so you will be seeing more horror reviews from me in the future. Until then...happy reading!4 stars ****"}], "description": "Jack Torrance's new job at the Overlook Hotel is the perfect chance for a fresh start.
