A perfect cozy mystery!! As the town gears up for the onslaught of tourists expected for a quilting event, Daisy is shocked by the murder of Reese Masemer, the man her good friend, Tess, had been dating. Daisy had no intention of poking her nose into the investigation, but when Tess becomes the primary suspect, she puts on her sleuthing hat once again to keep her friend from being charged with murder. In the meantime, Daisy is worried her oldest daughter is getting too serious with her new boyfriend, while her own romantic prospect hits a disappointing snag. This second installment in the \u2018Tea Garden Mystery\u2019 series, builds upon a sturdy foundation, becoming more solid and secure as characters develop a bit more and the location becomes more vivid. But, of course, we all showed up for a murder mystery, and this one is a real head scratcher. This is a series I think I could settle into long term. Daisy is a character I could really grow to love, as she is more \u2018mature\u2019, and the issues she copes with are realistic and easy to relate to. I love the supporting cast, and their interesting and compelling relationships. The romance is just little angsty, working on a slow build up, which is nice, as well. The mystery kept me on my toes and guessing from the start all the way to the nail biting conclusion! I loved the way this story ended, and enjoyed the awesome recipes included with the book. You really must try the cinnamon scones- they are to die for!! 4.5 stars"}, {"userName": "Jeanie", "userReviewDate": "May 28, 2018", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/15678788-jeanie", "userReview": "Second in the Daisy\u2019s Tea Garden Mystery series, the author shares a cheery setting, well-drawn characters, and mounting suspense that crests to quite a surprise! I really enjoy the characters at tea garden who work together as if part of a finely-choreographed dance. They are warm and welcoming in an atmosphere where one is content to have a cup of tea or coffee and scone and relax. I love this new series, perhaps because of the setting and the leading ladies \u2013 Daisy, Iris, and Tessa.Daisy Swanson grew up in Walnut Creek, PA, then she and her late husband, Ryan, moved away. After his death, Daisy formulated a plan, packed up her delightful daughters Vi, now 18, and Jazzi, now 15, returning to Walnut Creek. Daisy and her Aunt Iris purchased a Victorian home for Daisy\u2019s Tea Garden. Daisy\u2019s best friend Tessa is the kitchen manager, who lives on the second floor of the Tea Garden, and uses the attic for her painting.Daisy and three other business owners are on the committee planning a Quilt Lover\u2019s Weekend, which will hopefully provide a needed boost to the local economy for the winter weekend. They want to draw in people from nearby towns for year-round returns. There will be a drawing for two quilts, quilted kitchen goods for sale, and a demonstration at the local Quilts & Notions shop owned by an Amish woman, one of Daisy\u2019s childhood friends, Rachel.All is going well until Reese, Tessa\u2019s boyfriend who she has become very serious about, was found dead by the covered bridge, where Tessa has been working on a series of paintings. Reese, owner of the local gallery where Tessa had a showing last fall, was murdered. Tessa is the only suspect.Readers are treated to complex characters who we learn about through realistic dialog, actions, and revealing some of their backstories. Iris and Daisy are my favorites. Daisy reflects wisdom learned because of being a mother and, in recent years, a single mother. Each of the ladies, plus Foster, who work at Daisy\u2019s Tea Garden are hard-working and personable. Daisy\u2019s loyalty to Tessa and Foster through the challenges faced is exemplary, although it seemed at times that her words were challenging to a concerned parent and to Jonah when he tried to help her after she was attacked.Yes, Daisy was attacked on the stairs to Tessa\u2019s apartment. She was injured, but thankfully not as bad as it could have been. Her computer searching skills are still excellent, finding that Reese had a few secrets he hadn\u2019t shared with Tessa. This is a well-planned and executed multi-tiered mystery. Even though coffee is my preferred beverage, I appreciated learning more about the flavors of tea, how to prepare it, and seeing that I must try a white tea. Learning more about quilts, even though I can\u2019t sew a stitch, was also enjoyable. Plot twists and turns brought electrifying changes about the potential suspects. I was stymied by the mystery, and stunned when finding out who the bad guy or gal is! There are no loose ends, and the story is well wrapped up. I highly recommend Murder with Cinnamon Scones, as well as the first in series, Murder with Lemon Tarts.From a grateful heart: I received a copy of this e-Arc from the publisher and NetGalley, and this is my honest review."}, {"userName": "Betty", "userReviewDate": "May 10, 2018", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/27513977-betty", "userReview": "The second version of the Tea Lovers series has the merchant of Willow Creek, Pennsylvania planning a quilt event weekend.

The storyline is well plotted, the characters well developed, and the story moves at a steady pace. There\u2019s a perfect mix of the importance of family, friendship, caring and compassion, romance, and mystery. There are lots of twists and turns and red herrings to keep the reader engaged. Ms. Smith provides great character background and this book can be read as a standalone. I recommend this book to anyone who enjoys reading clean cozy mysteries.Daisy Swanson is a widow and she and her two daughters moved back to the small town of Willow Creek, Pennsylvania, to be near family. The quaint tea garden, Daisy\u2019s Tea Garden, she co-owns with her aunt, Iris Albright, is doing well. Daisy worries about her daughters; Jasmine, who\u2019s in high school, is adopted and has recently connected with her birth mother, Portia Smith Harding, who hasn\u2019t told her family about Jasmine, and Violet, who\u2019s away at college, is dating, Foster Cranshaw, one of the tea garden\u2019s employees. Daisy\u2019s been seeing Jonas Groft, a retired detective and owner of Woods, a handcrafted furniture store, but she feels something is wrong and is concerned about where their relationship is headed. Daisy\u2019s good friend, Tessa Miller, is the chef and kitchen manager at the tea garden and a talented artist who\u2019s been dating Reese Masemer since her October show in his gallery, Revelations Art Gallery.

I found it easy to jump into the story without having read the first book and it didn\u2019t take me long to feel like I knew the characters. I enjoyed that the protagonist, Daisy, is a widowed, single mom to practically grown children, instead of a twenty- or thirty-something single career gal. It allowed the character to have an added depth of life experiences that is used to great effect. The setting of Daisy\u2019s Tea Room, which she co-owns with her aunt, is darling and I liked hearing about the varieties of teas that they serve. I was especially drooling over the mention of Cinnamon Scones being served many times and am looking forward to trying that recipe which is provided at the back of the book. I also enjoyed the bits and pieces of information about the Amish living in their town that was woven into the story. It brings a different cultural feel to this cozy which I found charming. When Daisy\u2019s best friend, Tessa (who is also the chef at the tea room) is suspected of murdering her boyfriend, Daisy can\u2019t help but jump in to clear Tessa\u2019s name. While their community is small and close-knit, it surprised me that some of the residents were quick to believe the worst of Tessa. However, Daisy is a loyal friend and does everything she can to find the truth. The suspenseful conclusion wrapped the story up nicely and I look forward to catching up with the first book and reading more in this delightful series.

Of course, her own personal problems aren't helping her get to the bottom of this mystery, including the confused state with possible boyfriend, Jonas.

Daisy Swanson co-owns Daisy\u2019s Tea Garden with her Aunt Iris in Willow Creek, Pennsylvania. The town is getting ready for Quilt Lovers Weekend in three weeks. Daisy has been working with Reese Masemer, owner of Revelations Art Gallery and Tessa\u2019s boyfriend, on the preparations. Unfortunately, Reese will not get to enjoy the fruits of his labors. He is found dead in the woods near the covered bridge and Tessa finds herself at the top of the suspect list. Matters are not helped when Chloie Laird, Reese\u2019s attractive assistant, openly accuses Tessa of the crime at the tea shop. Knowing that Tessa did not commit the crime, Daisy takes a deep dive into Reese\u2019s life. It seems that Reese had some secrets and one of them could have gotten him killed. Murder with Cinnamon Scones is well-written and has steady pacing. There is a lovely cast of characters and a charming town. Daisy is friendly, smart main character who is moving on with her life after the death of her husband. I think she is handling her adopted daughter\u2019s (Jazzi) search for her biological mother very well. It is sensitive issue that the author handled thoughtfully. Daisy has starting dating Jonas Graft, but their path is bumpy. I could have done with less romance and more mystery. I prefer a romance that plays out slowly in the background. There are beautiful quilt descriptions in the book especially of the Baltimore Album Quilt. There are many cozy moments with cooking, baking, eating, tea events, family time, town events, quilting plus more. I especially like that Daisy and her kids live in a converted barn. Foster Crenshaw\u2019s father is worried about him working at the tea garden and his relationship with Daisy\u2019s daughter, Violet. Mr. Crenshaw does not want Foster\u2019s college plans derailed. The mystery had some good components, a couple of suspects and misdirection. I am not a fan of Detective Morris Rappaport who is a clich\u00e9 cozy mystery detective. Murder with Cinnamon Scones can be read alone if you have not had the opportunity to pick up Murder with Lemon Tea Cakes. I am rating Murder with Cinnamon Scones 4 out of 5 stars.

Decisive details are scattered throughout and the list of possible suspects continues to grow, and I remained riveted because of the large number of unknowns. Karen Rose Smith masterfully keeps the reader captivated, as any guesses that I made were pure speculation. MURDER WITH CINNAMON SCONES is enjoyably intriguing at all times.Life is going well for Daisy Swanson, as the business that she owns with an aunt has many repeat customers plus her two teenage daughters are happy. Opening Daisy\u2019s Tea Garden helped the widow provide for her children while also making each day a little cheerier. The upcoming Quilt Lovers Weekend festivities will hopefully bring in lots of new patrons, and perhaps some folks will even return. A good friend named Tessa Miller oversees the food sold, and the talented artist has been dating Reese Masemer who owns a local art gallery.Lately, the behavior of Reese seems a little off, as he often appears distracted. When his body is discovered close to a covered bridge and it is apparent that he was killed, the police question Tessa because of her relationship with him. Daisy has no intention of searching for any clues this time like she did when a murder occurred in the tea garden, though she did provide some valuable assistance. But as more evidence piles up against her friend, she just might be forced to look for information which would point toward the real killer.Sometimes the motives driving a person to kill are divulged at the start of a book, but that is definitely not the case in this story. I always like having the chance to ponder any clues, and then come to a conclusion based on my deductions. Karen Rose Smith cleverly made MURDER WITH CINNAMON SCONES entertaining because of the vast number of secrets to be exposed plus the great cast of characters. I enjoy when a revelation only leads to the need for additional answers, and this is what drove Daisy to search for the truth about the murder. As she becomes an amateur sleuth once again, she hopes no situations turn dangerous. She has a huge group of friends and family who are exceedingly helpful, and her personal relationship with one man has me wondering what might happen in the future. Also, there are some family issues which are very realistic.There are quite a few scenes in MURDER WITH CINNAMON SCONES which deal with food or tea, and regardless of what is being served, the vivid descriptions left me craving something to eat and definitely drink. I am a longtime tea drinker, and some of the varieties mentioned are ones that I want to try. Also, Ms. Smith listed recipes for several dishes mentioned in the story, and each one sounds truly appetizing. I really hope there are many more books about Daisy and the very interesting Willow Creek citizens.

Thank you to the author for these fabulous recipes. Daisy and her Aunt are preparing for a weekend quilting event and their shop is displaying many of the handmade quilts and crafts of the area. Daisy's employee Tessa has had words with the louse she was dating and after he is found dead she is being accused . Daisy steps up right away to help her friend and clear her name. She has to traverse many suspicions toward Tessa but soon finds many others had reason to dislike the louse and wish him gone. She is in danger as the suspect soon finds out she is investigating . The sleuth is so well crafted I was unable to guess the ending. This avid mystery reader was kept guessing throughout. This is Amish country and the location is so beautifully described the reader is swept into the idyllic small town as if we are there. The supporting charcters all add depth to the story and are delightful people we wish we knew as friends. I love the description of the tea shop and the community that is supportive of Daisy and her new venture . This is a winning series that I look forward to for many more installments. The author has crafted the town, the setting , the sleuth and charcters to perfection. This is undeniably the definitive cozy mystery series. Thank you for the ARC which did not influence my review. I highly recommend this series for all cozy mystery readers."}, {"userName": "Lghiggins", "userReviewDate": "Jun 05, 2018", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/42975487-lghiggins", "userReview": "Murder with Cinnamon Scones is the tale of an art dealer\u2019s death, suspicions placed on those he loved, and the struggles we all go through in trying to make sense of our lives. As with most cozy mysteries, this one is set in a small town trying to survive. In Willow Creek, Pennsylvania, as January surrounds the town with cold and some intermittent snow, small business owners are cooperating to draw in more tourists through Quilt Lovers Weekend. Daisy, who owns Daisy\u2019s Tea Garden, is one of the leaders of this group. She finds her time divided between running the tea shop, investigating a murder to clear her friend Tessa, and developing friendships with two handsome men. She also devotes time to her two teenage daughters, the quilting weekends, her extended family, and her cats. Oh, and she also has to stay alive!As busy as Daisy is, she still has the time and skills to maintain her tearoom as a successful business. With an emphasis on customer service, the tearoom draws visitors and locals for its delicious formal teas as well as soups, breads, and more casual tea service. Daisy and others at the tearoom are constantly experimenting with recipes, and the various types of teas mentioned in the book are so appealing. If this weren\u2019t fiction, I\u2019d be eager to visit this delightful tearoom housed in an updated Victorian house.I highly recommend Murder with Cinnamon Scones for a good mystery, a surprising resolution, and interesting characters and settings. In it lies a poignant reminder that in relationships, things are not always what they appear to be. I\u2019m glad it is part of a series because I was sad to reach the end of the book.I would like to extend my thanks to netgalley.com and to Kensington Books for giving me the opportunity to read this book in exchange for an honest review."}, {"userName": "Rosemary K", "userReviewDate": "May 31, 2018", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/5327299-rosemary-k", "userReview": "Daisy Swanson is looking forward to the Quilt Lover's Weekend. She hopes it will bring lots of people to Willow Creek. She just doesn't expect that the murder of Reese Masemer will start the event or that her good friend, Tessa, will be the main suspect. Can she help solve the crime? I'm glad to be back at Daisy's Tea Room. I love hearing about the special teas and the bakery. I also enjoy the recipes that are included. Daisy is a compelling character. I admire her courage and determination. Her understanding and compassion draw me to this character. She won't stop her investigation. Tessa stands strong against the accusations that she killed her boyfriend, but she's very afraid. I felt sorry that she had go through this. I was glad that Daisy was there for her. I felt that Daisy has grown as a person. I was happy to see that she and Jonas had a heartfelt talk and cleared the air. I think they would make a perfect couple. There is definite chemistry between them. I enjoyed the other characters. Each one was well written. The dialogue is realistic and the setting is perfect. I loved the kitties. The both have strong personalities. The story is suspenseful and filled with surprises. I didn't expect the ending. I never saw it coming. I enjoy the writing of Karen Rose Smith.

Karen Rose Smith accomplishes that and more with this series.The characters are well developed and have depth in their relationships, which do not always flow smoothly. Such is the reality in real families and friendships. I especially like how Daisy remains friends with Rachel, an Amish woman she's known since childhood, even though their lives are very different. And how Daisy shares her worries about meeting her adopted daughter's birth mother and about her elder daughter becoming an independent woman. I could relate!When best friend and coworker Tessa is in the spotlight as a murder suspect, you find out who in town is a true friend. Secrets are revealed about Tessa's male friend and we learn more about Daisy's romantic interest, Jonas. A lot of underlying emotions influence the storyline.An all around wonderful read. While the ending is satisfying, it also leaves me wanting more to come. I want to visit Willow Creek again!I accepted a copy of this book via Netgalley to review.

I am thoroughly enjoying this series. As a Cozy Mystery Lover, I enjoy a light story with a possible budding romance and several twists and turns. This series and this installment do it all. I enjoyed this one as much at the first.A little catch up, Daisy is a widow and mother of 2 girls that moved back to her small hometown and opened a tea shop with her Aunt Iris. In both novels, someone Daisy is close to is accused of killing their loved one. The typical small town investigator is lazy with a chip on his shoulder. He just wants to pin the charges on the easiest target. Daisy, along with her friend Jonas ( a retired police officer), set out to prove the him wrong and help solve the case. What I enjoy about this series a little more than some, is that Daisy isn't out there putting herself directly into harm's way. I mean, of course she finds herself in compromising positions, but not like some other cozies. Also, in both of the books, I didn't know who the murder was until the parts of the books. Highly recommend for cozy lovers. Also, the scone recipes look sinful!!"}, {"userName": "Kathleen Chrisman", "userReviewDate": "Jun 01, 2018", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/23842487-kathleen-chrisman", "userReview": "Daisy Swanson has her hands full getting ready for the big quilting weekend event that is expected to bring lots of tourists to town.

It was my first time reading a book by this author and I was not disappointed. Daisy and Tessa run a Tea Garden in a small town, when the man Tessa's been dating is found murdered with Tessa as the main suspect. Daisy decides to help her friend and the police with the investigation. What I liked a lot about the story was the setting. Willow Creek and its people were interesting. I had the feeling that there were so many subplots and that the mystery was not always the most important plotline. There were some loose ends but I'm guessing there will be a new installment in this series in which I will find out what happens with Jazzi and her biological mother, for example.
