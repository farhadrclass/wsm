After I binge-read all the available Kate books, I moved onto \nThe Edge\n which I also loved, and knowing that the Ilona love was not a fluke, the internet stalking began, in which I discovered the Curran POV Collection and \nKinsmen\n sci-fi short stories, etc.And the Andrews, have never, not once, let me down.BURN FOR ME, the first installment of the HIDDEN LEGACY series, takes place in a world where a few hundred years ago a serum was discovered that could awaken a myriad of different types of magic in humans. Eventually the serum was destroyed, but the damage had already been done, and the newly awakened magical gifts were passed on genetically. Fast forward to the present, and the highly magical families guard their bloodlines the same way the real world Western European blue bloods do.Enter Nevada Baylor, who at 25 has had the responsibility of keeping the family PI business afloat since her father died of cancer six years ago.The family PI business whose mortgage was sold to one of the Big Deal magical families in order to pay the medical bills. The family PI business the Big Deal magical family is offering up as a sacrificial lamb when our story begins.Baylor Investigative Agency looks great on paper, you see, and Montgomery International Investigations (MII) has been asked by another Big Deal magical family to bring in their prodigal son, a Prime (the highest level of magic user) pyro(FIRE)kinetic, who just recently burnt up a bank, which resulted in the death of a cop amongst other things. MII, being unable to refuse such a request without risking unpleasantness, weighed the risks, deemed an honest attempt too expensive, and decided to make use of the clause in the mortgage agreement that allows them to contract out Nevada\u2019s services.If she refuses, she breaks the contract, and the business is forfeit. If she fails, she breaks the contract, and the business is forfeit. If she dies, MII gets to recoup their loses, and the business is forfeit.And this was the point where I shrieked my vicarious RAGE and scared the crap out of my cat. Seriously. He sat on the floor in front of the bed for the rest of the day. Wouldn\u2019t come near me . . .Such was the level of emotion the book was able to pull out of me, and that was in the first 8%.That\u2019s one of my favorite things about the Andrews\u2014their ability to create instantly likable and/or interesting characters. Slews of them. Nevada is a perfect example of this. She\u2019s snarky and fantastic, so much so that you don\u2019t mind or begrudge her her super special snowflake status.Nevada\u2019s family is the \u201cslew,\u201d her grandmother especially is a hoot, and then there\u2019s Mad Rogan . . .Mad Rogan, a Prime with off-the-charts magical abilities . . . Mad Rogan, the wealthy and powerful head of House Rogan . . . Mad Rogan, pure sex walking around on two legs . . .Mad Rogan, the borderline sociopath.Yes, you heard me: SOCIOPATH.I can only hope more is revealed in future installments to make him a more sympathetic character, b/c, right now, Mad Rogan is my only real issue with this book.Oh, there was also some slight disbelief with the Big Reveal at the very end, but that was small potatoes. Mad Rogan, on the other hand . . . he\u2019s downright scary. Like Ted Bundy scary. And I can see Nevada being hot for him, but eventually in love with him . . . ? As it stands, she should run screaming, in the opposite direction.Literally Mad Rogan aside, Burn for Me is positively delightful. The world-building is fresh and original. The characters are hilarious, and the sense of family will give you the warm-fuzzies. Those of you who stalk follow the Andrews like I do will particularly enjoy a scenario with Nevada\u2019s high school-aged sisters that very closely resembled something that happened with one of their daughters\u2014the pen is mightier than the high school coach. *wink* Overall, an excellent start to a wonderful new series. Nevada Baylor is now second to only Kate Daniels.

I feel I have to say this because it seems like every time I pick up an Ilona Andrews book, I find myself fawning all over it, like a teenage girl with her first crush. BUT IT'S REAL LOVE. I SWEAR.This book rocked my socks off as much as any Kate Daniels book ever has. And while the Andrews team has a unique voice that is unmistakable, this book is not Kate: Part 2. The world-building is fantastic and utterly different from the some of the tired UF/ PNR templates I find in so many books of these genres. I loved the heroine. I loved the hero. I loved the unpredictable progression of the plot. And I loved the foundation of a romance that promises to be spectacular. I'm going to stop gushing for a moment and tell you a little about the story.It takes place in world where the wealthy and powerful wield magic, and create influential dynasties surrounding their skills. One of the strongest members of one of the most powerful families has gone rogue and now small-time PI Nevada Baylor is tasked to bring him in unharmed. She doesn't want the job. It's way out of her league, but circumstances force her hand and before she knows it, she is tackling a job too big for even the police to take on.Mad Rogan is a force just as powerful as Nevada's target. Maybe even more so. Which is why she wants nothing to do with him. But he has his own reasons to want to capture Adam Pierce and he knows Nevada may actually be savvy enough to do it. He pushes his way into her investigation --and into her life-- sparking a mutual attraction she can't control and he doesn't want to. Their mission is dangerous, exciting, and completely captivating from beginning to end.Nevada is impossible not to like. She's devoted to her family. She loves them and she's kind of taken over the mantle as the person responsible for them all. I love how Andrews paints these characters. They feel so real. They have quirks and color that make you feel like you know them; you can see why they mean so much to Nev. I love how smart the heroine is. How she tries to be practical instead of reckless. How she is so vastly powerful but has absolutely no idea.Rogan is totally badass. He can level cities with a thought. He is every bit the dragon of Nev's musings. But he is also more than that. I feel like she can teach him so much about what it means to be human... what it means to feel. The sexual tension between these two is off the charts. Her reactions to him are so hot and every time they touch, I am glued to the page.So I mentioned the great characters, the phenomenal world-building, and the scorching sexual tension. But I also have to give a shout-out to the awesome pacing and funny, funny one liners. Right in the middle of a serious conversation or observation, we're treated to inside jokes on tortured heroes and snake-penis metaphors. I laughed out loud more than once.It's smart. It's engaging. And I wouldn't change a thing.Disclosure: I beta read for this book. But I already considered it an A-read on the first pass. And I swear, if I didn't like it, I would tell you.*ARC provided by author for review"}, {"userName": "Navessa", "userReviewDate": "Dec 19, 2014", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/18104163-navessa", "userReview": "Let's talk about expectations, shall we? A few years ago, I went on a business trip to London. I was good friends with the co-workers I traveled with, and already had a fantastic rapport going with our British counterparts because I served as the liaison between our two companies. The trip was a roaring success; everyone not only got along, but got along really well, and because of this dynamic, we accomplished everything we set out to early on in the week. That left us with a lot of free time to tour the city. And by tour the city, I mean tour the pubs.Each night after work, we would pour forth from the office doors in search of the nearest or loudest watering hole. One evening, already half-smashed thanks to the deceptively strong cider I'd been downing (seriously, what the hell is in that stuff?), I ordered pie off the menu, because apparently I fancied the idea of descending into a sugar-induced coma. The \"dessert\" arrived a few minutes later, carrying with it the smell of golden pie crust and roasting meat. In my inebriated state, I brushed off the unexpected seared-flesh scent, thinking that it must have emanated from something else on the tray the bartender carried. I stabbed at the pie and lifted a steaming spoonful to my mouth. Maybe, if I hadn't been absorbed in the conversation taking place at my table, or if I hadn't been such a goddamn lightweight, I would have noticed that something was off. I would have realized that my spoon hadn't slid into the pie with the same ease I would expect from a fruit-filled delicacy. I would have caught sight of the chunks of carrots and peas that ascended to my lips. I would have seen the massive chunk of meat hanging off my spoon. Alas, I didn't. Did I mention I'm a vegetarian? No? Ah, well, now you might understand why after biting into the carcass of a dead animal when I expected a dead fruit I tore out of the room and vomited spectacularly onto the sidewalk, narrowly missing a group of pedestrians. It was all anyone talked about for the rest of the week. And when we briefed our boss on the success of the trip after arriving back home, one of my co-workers, who is sadistically quick on his feet, snuck a picture of my humiliation into the slide show. -____-I'm sure you're wondering what the hell this story has to do with Burn for Me. Well, let me tell you. I went into this expecting a paranormal romance. I had recently finished reading a book that had made me think about a lot of things - too many things - and I wanted to turn my brain off for a few blissful hours. I wanted something light and fluffy and sexy. And really, with a title as cheesy as Burn for Me, who could blame me for thinking that this would deliver? Also, have you seen this cover? It promises certain things. Let me demonstrate what went through my mind when I first saw it:Imagine my surprise when instead of witty banter and half-veiled propositions I was met with nearly a hundred pages of (shoddy) world building. I spent the first thirty percent of this book regretting my decision to pick it up. I spent the next twenty percent trying to stifle my hope, lest I be disappointed. I spent the last fifty percent enjoying the hell out of myself but also having some SERIOUS misgivings about all the woman-on-woman hatred and the shitbag of a male lead. In short, the second half of the book did not make up for the first, just balanced my rating out a little. This was not the fluff-filled dessert that I had expected. This was a goddamn meat pie.

They marry for the power it brings their families, and those Houses rule cities and corporations.

Burn for Me delivered on all accounts. Urban Fantasy is my go to genre when I need something light, fun and the right amount of sexy. Ilona Andrews is one of my favourite writers for this type of books and I knew I couldn\u2019t go wrong with her new series. I love Kate Daniel\u2019s adventure but I wanted something new and maybe a little bit more romance so decided to start the Hidden Legacy.Nevada Baylor is a 25 years old, attractive woman who owns a small private detective agency. She lives and works in a warehouse together with her extended family: grandma, mother, 2 sisters and 2 cousins. Nevada\u2019s world is bit different than ours. During the 1800\u2019 a serum was discovered which conferred magical powers to people. Those powers differed in strength and form and were passed to offsprings. Although the serum was banned after its dangers became obvious, people continued to posses magical talents and the society changed in order to favour those with magic. The most potent magic users, the Primes became the leaders of Houses which pretty much controll the world. Nevada has her own special skill, namely she can tell if someone is lying, a handy talent to have in her job. Her relatively safe existence is shattered when she is hired to locate one of the most wanted criminals and to bring him to his family unharmed.Mad Rogan is a former soldier with a destructive power, a Prime and the leader of a powerful House. He is tangled in the same investigation in order to protect one of his relatives. The paths of Nevada and Rogan will intersect and, although they had a bad start they will be forced to work together. I enjoyed Nevada\u2019s characters and the relationship with her family. I particularly loved her bad ass, tanker fixer, grandma. An Rogan, well, he is hot. :)) I do like an alpha whose heart needs to be discovered, although I wouldn't touch this kind of person in real life. Also, because in real life assholes usually remain assholes. It was funny, full of action and I can\u2019t wait to read the 2nd volume asap. P.S. The 2nd one is almost done ;)"}, {"userName": "Maja (The Nocturnal Library)", "userReviewDate": "Mar 07, 2014", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/4551536-maja-the-nocturnal-library", "userReview": "After the brilliant Magic Breaks, Burn for Me further proves that Ilona and Gordon can do whatever the hell they want and it will always be gloriously entertaining!Only three things are certain in life: death, taxes, and good UF from Ilona Andrews. There aren\u2019t many authors who can be counted upon to always deliver the best, but Ilona and Gordon are among them. Burn for Me is just another in a long string of successes for this husband-and-wife writing team. Please don\u2019t let the cover and the title mislead you. Burn for Me is not paranormal romance. In fact, it\u2019s urban fantasy in its purest form, with only a hint of romantic development to keep things even more entertaining. Ilona and Gordon once again did what they do best \u2013 they created a compelling world and filled it with fascinating characters and plenty of danger and action.Nevada Baylor is a heroine with a backbone of steel, just the way I like them. She carries some heavy burdens and makes some hard decisions along the way, but she\u2019s never indecisive or weak. Her family is also very colorful, starting with her grandma Frida and ending with her young cousin with a man-crush on Mad Rogan. And then there\u2019s Mad Rogan himself (and yes, he actually answers to that name). He has the looks, the money and the unimaginable power. In short, he has everything but Nevada Baylor\u2019s trust, and he\u2019s determined to get it (and consequently her) at any cost. Their relationship starts with a kidnapping, involves things like snipers and duct tape, and ends with a juicy promise and lots of pent-up passion. Lots and lots of pent-up heat and unfulfilled desires. Their interactions are hilarious, the dialogue witty and quick, Ilona-Andrews-style, and the promise of things to come is more than enough to keep us fully invested and desperate for the next installment. The worldbuilding is considerably different from their other series, and it\u2019s where this fabulous duo shines. I loved their version of Houston, and the quality of their writing made the short world-establishing prologue almost unnecessary. They have a way of including just enough information for the story to function smoothly, never overwhelming the reader, never creating confusion and never ever info-dumping. I don\u2019t give five stars often, nor do I do it lightly, but this book deserves more praise than I can possibly give.

I've given only 11, 5 stars. 7 of these are by Ilona Andrews. If that doesn't tell you how good they are and that you check out their books, I don't know what will.Ok, not enough? Fine. Let's see, why would this book be worth it? First, I need you to forget that beautiful hot  cover (the male model doesn't even look good, for God's sake...) and the title (because it's not what you think it means). Now let's see the content:\u2780 Awesome family. Yes, this is #1 because we rarely see good families in books. Most of the time, parents are dead, the MC isn't on good terms with them, or they're bad but he/she is trying to earn their love. However, in this book, they live together: Nevada, her mother, her super cool grandmother, 2 teenage sisters, 2 cousins (yes people normally have cousins), and they all live in a warehouse. I don't think I've ever read a book in which the adult MC actually lives with the parents. And is happy with it. It felt kinda weird even though it's the normal thing to do in my country... it's so rare in novels nowadays. Thus, I naturally loved this aspect. The family\u2019s bickering was so entertaining as well.\u2781 Nevada. This girl is amazing!!!! Yes, she might not have the strongest powers, yes she might not be able to use her own magic to kill, but she definitely can handle herself. Confident, snarky, smart, and resourceful, she\u2019s all I can hope for in a heroine. She\u2019s a living lie-detector, perfect for her job as an investigator. I honestly wasn\u2019t sure if I should expect another Kate (who is my favorite heroine ever) but I\u2019m glad that Nevada was so different and yet just like Kate, doesn\u2019t take shit from anyone, she can hold her own ground, she's her own person, and is also badass.\u2782 Mad Roger. IM SWOONING. He\u2019s just perfect. He's a bit the anti-hero. The slow burn romance was so hot and just exciting. Don\u2019t be fooled. This is no romance book, though. It has heavy world building, more action, and very little kissing. So the title and that damn cover can totally trick you (in a bad way) but don\u2019t let them. Seriously, if I need to give an example why people shouldn\u2019t trust covers, I\u2019ll just give the Andrews books as an example. Anyway, back to Mr. Roger, his interactions with Nevada made me want to pick the next book now. But alas, my tbr list always gets in the way. Yes, he does try to order her around but she stands up for herself. The difference in his behavior comparing to the start is very clear. He\u2019s murder who can do this tactile stuff that well... I\u2019ll let you find out if you ever read this book. It\u2019s like explaining how a jet flies to someone who has never seen a plane. \u2782 The world-building. After the release of a serum back in 1871 that gives humans supernatural abilities, things got messy. Those with great magic abilities (pyrokinetic, telekinetic, aerokinetic\u2026) pass their abilities to their children (the stronger the parents, the stronger the children's magic and therefore, they only marry for power). Each powerful family forms a House, on the head of it, a Prime (highest magic rank). The more magic you have, the richer you are. Some didn\u2019t have big abilities but minor or not, a magic user should never be underestimated.\u2783 All the characters. I loved them all from Nevada and Mad Roger to Adam Pierce. Grandmother Frida, who is obsessed with hot guys like a teenager, is simply hilarious. She\u2019s so precious, I adore her. I hope she survives this trilogy. Even her mother is cool. Everyone has his own distinctive character. \u2784 Addicting plot. The book is full of action, mainly shooting people, burning people, and chocking people. It\u2019s also fast paced and addicting. The romance is to die for because it\u2019s so hot, intense, and most important of all, slow. Nevada doesn\u2019t buy his shit. I love the sarcasm in the Andrews books. A lot. I won\u2019t talk more about the plot and let you know discover the story for yourself. You only need to know that Nevada is forced to make Adam Pierce, pyrokinetic prime, surrender to his family and Mad Roger needs to find his cousin who is associated with Pierce. So she\u2019s forced to work with him since he has the manpower and some information.If you\u2019re a fan of Urban fantasy, this book is a must read. If you aren\u2019t, it\u2019s still worth checking out if you like these stuff. I just think Ilona Andrews is so underrated and I wish her books were more popular. I mean I only see people way older than me reading them so I can never fangirl except with some very few people (*cough* Annie (whom I BR this book with) and Tweebs. So yeah, please try this book!

And once again they weaved their magic and I fell for it! I love this book! Crushing hard on Mad Rogan and Nevada, in the modern vernacular totally shipping them!Nevada Baylor is a strong young woman that's been struggling to keep her family and business afloat. She does her job, tries to uphold the laws and keep the hard earned state of calm her family finally has. Unfortunately for her she's given a case to retrieve a very powerful magic user, a Prime, or forfeit everything she has worked so hard for. It's suicide but she sees no other option. I absolutely adored Nevada. A strong heroine, absolute loyalty to her family and a very strong sense of ethics, of right and wrong.We are introduced to her family which I also loved and I'm looking forward to read much more of them. I have such a weak spot for her Grandma! I wish my Grandmother was like her. Nevada decides on a course of action but guess who disrupts everything by kidnapping her? None other than Connor \u201cMad\u201d Rogan.Mad Rogan is also an extremely powerful Prime and has the same mission as Nevada but for his own reasons. He decides the best thing to do is to kidnap her and find out what she knows but the whole thing backfires on him. There's a reason he is called Mad and you see it from the beginning. Very imposing figure, dangerously attractive and just plain dangerous. He's also insanely hot, intense, commanding and swoon worthy to the nth degree. There's undeniable attraction between Nevada and Rogan, the pull and push of their chemistry makes an amazing read I couldn't put down. I wanted to know how they'll catch the bad guy, I wanted to know if they'll get together. I wanted to read more of Grandma! I kept reading until I devoured the whole book and I still want more. The second book cannot come soon enough!I am fangirling on Ilona Andrews and I'm not ashamed to say it."}, {"userName": "Melindam", "userReviewDate": "Mar 21, 2017", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/36434323-melindam", "userReview": "This statement has never been more true than for this particular book. The cover just screams \"cheap-romance-with-sex\" and if it hadn't been for the recommendations of Tadiana & Steven I probably wouldn't have touched it with a barge-pole (yes, I am a booksnob).But I listened to reason (recommendations), wrapped the book in thick paper & started reading ... and then I got hooked & I had great fun. The story has everything you need and in perfect proportions: nice world-building with urban fantasy elements, sympathetic main and secondary characters, action, romance & humour (never an element to be taken lightly). Influential families (called Houses) with powerful magic rule this alternate world and also control territories in Houston, where our story takes place. There are several kinds of magical abilities (telepaths, telekinetics, pyro/aquakinetics, etc) and several levels: minor, average, notable, significant & prime. Primes are usually the leaders of their families/houses and also \"breed\" to have offsprings with even more magic as it means social and economical power: the more you have the more influential you are. Of course, there are the \"multitudes\" with little or no magic: Nevada Baylor & her family is considered to be among them. She is managing a small private investigator agency and gets forced by her employer, House Montgomery, to go after a crime suspect who is a dangerous pyrokinetic & an anarchist, way out of her league. When, out of the blue, Connor \"Mad\" Rogan - prime of House Rogan & notorious ex-army \"weapon\"- gets involved, things get even more dangerous & complicated & intriguing ...It was very easy to like the MC Nevada Baylor: she is level-headed, funny and absolutely loyal to and fiercely protective of her family. She has her principles and her and her family's code of honour is very respectable & relatable. There are some hints of her being maybe, just maybe, a special-snowflake and yet to me she seemed normal & ordinary in the \"I could be her\" kind of way (well, I can't shoot or run very quickly, but the feeling is still there, if you know what I mean :) . )I also found Connor \"Mad\" Rogan a very appealing male lead, despite the suspicions I usually nurture whenever a customary alpha-male-billionaire is around. He was smart. I mean really smart, not just described as such and, just like Nevada, I couldn't help being fascinated by his brutal efficiency and found his total lack of social skills almost charming. His character development is handled very well by the authors. At the beginning he seemed to be one-dimensional and step by step we get to see behind his facade and discover his depths. He also has this self-deprecating sense of humour, which I liked. His encounter with Nevada's family & the following \"interrogation\" and banter from their side was one of the funniest scenes in the book. The secondary characters, members of Neva's family, are a delight to read about and their always being there for each other really gives you this warm, fuzzy feeling all around. The action and the world-building part (magic, politics) is also well thought-out and built-up. There is a certain conclusion to the storyline, but we find out at the same time that a greater pattern is behind of this particular adventure & I am glad it will continue & soon.Original UpdateWell, never judge a book by its cover and all that ... and feel free to despise me for being a horrible booksnob, but this cover is just ... Yikes! *shudder*"}, {"userName": "Sarah", "userReviewDate": "Feb 28, 2014", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/3344685-sarah", "userReview": "1st read - October 20142nd read - October 20163rd read - 12th December 20164th read - 14th December 20165th read - 22nd April 20176th read - 25nd April 20177th read - May 20178th read - November 20179th read - May 2018Original ReviewI'm a massive fan of Ilona and Gordon Andrews's Kate Daniels series, in fact I'd put it right up there as one of my favourites, so of course I couldn't wait to dive into their newest novel and explore another world they've created in Burn for Me. When I pick up a story from a favourite author I always go into it with high expectations and sometimes that can work against me but this husband and wife team have never let me down and with each new book they consistently hit the ball out of the park. They excel at excellent world building, creating strong female lead characters, sexy heroes and fantastic casts of side characters and that is exactly what they've done again in Burn for Me. I wanted to climb into the book and live there, Nevada would make a great friend although I don't think she'd appreciate me having such a big crush on Rogan LOL.Nevada is a private investigator in charge of running her family business, they're a small operation and money is tight so Nevada is under a lot of pressure to keep her family stable financially. She has a close relationship with her mother, grandmother and younger cousins and siblings but as the main breadwinner she has a lot on her shoulders. When she is asked to take on a case against a Prime magic user she knows she has very little chance of succeeding but the money she could earn would make a huge difference to her entire family and it's not like she has much choice other than to accept. As if going up against a Prime wasn't bad enough the case also brings her to the attention of Mad Rogan, an eccentric billionaire and powerful magic user in his own right. Rogan doesn't play by the rules and he will do whatever it takes to get what he wants, for now it is in his best interests to work alongside Nevada but she knows she can't trust him to have her back if their goals change which makes him trouble.I absolutely loved the world that Ilona Andrews has created, the magical system is well explained and thought out and the idea of the powerful magical families having mob like control over certain areas was a brilliant one. These families do whatever it takes to protect their interests and to keep their bloodlines pure and it is safer to stay under their radar, something Nevada and her family have always tried to do in the past. Her latest case drags her right into the middle of things though and she's now stuck in an impossible situation. She isn't powerful enough to tackle the case on her own but accepting help from one family could set the others against her. Nevada is a great lead, she is strong and intelligent, she knows her own mind and she doesn't let anyone get away with pushing her around. She cares about her family and is willing to risk everything to keep them safe but as much as she would prefer to go it alone she is willing to accept help when she needs it. I loved the relationships she has with her various family members, in fact, the whole family was just so much fun to spend time with. There are some quite eccentric characters amongst them but I mean that in the best possible way and I can't wait to see more of them as the series continues.Then you have Mad Rogan. What can I say about Rogan apart from that I have the biggest crush on him? Nevada and Rogan don't get off to the best start and considering that Rogan kidnaps her trying to get information that isn't too surprising. Technically I shouldn't like Rogan for that incident alone but oh boy do they have some fabulous chemistry going on between them. I loved the fact that Nevada didn't instantly forgive Rogan and act on her attraction to him, in fact she is fighting it all the way because she is still annoyed at his behaviour but he's definitely wearing her down and I can't even blame her for that. Rogan is dangerous with a capital D. He isn't the kind of guy who lets anyone close easily and if you're not part of his family then he really has very little interest in what happens to you. He doesn't have standard morals so if you're not an ally you're automatically a potential enemy and he'll have no reservation about doing whatever it takes to make sure you give him what he wants. However, once he has given someone his loyalty they can trust him to have their backs no matter what. Nevada starts to see that but it's going to take a lot before she accepts that they are anything beyond convenient, and temporary, allies for the length of their current case. I'm incredibly excited about seeing them spending more time together and I'm also looking forward to seeing Nevada start to get more control over her abilities.I could rave on and on about Burn for Me but if I haven't already convinced you to give this series a try then I don't think anything else I could say will make a difference. This is a fantastic start to the Hidden Legacy series and any future books will be going immediately to the top of my to read pile.----------------------------PREVIOUS UPDATES:28th Feb 2014: Want.

I'M SOOOOOOOOO EXCITED!!!!!!!!!!!!______________________2nd ReadI told myself I was going to read this slowly the second time so that I could savour every minute. I should have known that would be impossible - I just can't read anything by Ilona and Gordon Andrews slowly, their books are written to be devoured in one sitting!I started this before heading to bed (again I should have known better!) and ended up staying up all night reading until I was finished. I absolutely love Nevada and Rogan and I can't wait to reread this again before White Hot finally releases (I'm actually tempted to read it again now but I figure I should wait at least a couple of months LOL).______________________3rd ReadYou know you have a problem when you only manage to wait just over a month before you have to reread a book again! To be honest I'm not sure how I held off for 2 years the first time around (probably because I knew it would be such a long wait for White Hot to release!) but now I'm just too addicted to Rogan to go long without him.This book gets better and better with every reread - like all of Ilona and Gordon's books. They're the Queen and King of UF!______________________4th ReadNo that's not a typo, I really did read both this book AND White Hot twice each in about 5 days LOL. I am totally addicted to this series and Rogan IS MINE!!______________________5th ReadI love this book more every time I read it! The characters, the world, MAD ROGAN!

New rating: FIVE You-Couldn't-Handle-My-Snake STARS! I have no idea what I was thinking when I read this the first time. \"3.5-3.8 stars?!\" Pffffffffffffffft.This time around, I really liked Rogan a lot more. Grandma Frida is awesome.I loved the world-building so much.MORE MORE MORE!!!!!!!!!!!!!!Original post:Maybe more like 3.5-3.8 stars?  This was a great first book in a new series. It's an urban fantasy set in Houston. The setting is about present time but we're in an alternate type reality, where science discovered a \"serum\" in the late 1800s that could bring out a person's latent magic abilities. So now some people can control animals, water, fire, all kinds of various things. The stronger your magic, the wealthier and more powerful in society you tend to be. The rich, notable families marry for genetics. Our main girl, Nevada Baylor, is a barely-getting-by private investigator who has what she thinks is minor magic. Her company is family run, but owned by a more powerful company who forces her into a seemingly impossible job. She ends up being (to her dismay) partnered with Mad Rogan, a loose cannon with past military experience and head of a powerful magical House. He's a Prime, which means he is rated highest in his magical type - and he also might be slightly psychotic. But he's sexy and of course, Nevada is drawn to him right away (and he to her). But they're both hot and unattached, so who can blame them? This isn't a paranormal romance, but it has a bit of that sprinkled throughout. This is going to be a slow build relationship. Don't be expecting a fully realized romance by the end of this book. But that's a good thing, in my view.I think Ilona Andrews proves they get better and better. There was some great world-building. I look forward to continuing the series. I think this was probably a better first book than the first Kate Daniels book. I have no doubt that this series will blossom into a kick-ass series similiar to that one (but unique in its own way)."}, {"userName": "Deborah Obida", "userReviewDate": "Oct 31, 2017", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/54790180-deborah-obida", "userReview": "As much as I hate the cover, Tessy said its an amazing book and won't stop gushing about it. In return I gave her one of my favourite books to read. Guess what? She was right, I loved it.#Experimental love read.I don\u2019t even know where to begin this review from, I love the book, charcters, magic, plot etc. But I still find it hard to review this. Urban fantasy and 3 star reviews have always being my hardest to write but I will do my best to make this good. World building and Writing The magic system is very easy to understand, if you understand the magic then you understand the world which in tur0n will make you understand and like the book.Magic users were segregated into five ranks: Minor, Average, Notable, Significant, and Prime.The primes are the most powerful, they rule and own basically everything, from companies to school, lands etc. You are as important as your magic rank. The writing is okay, the book is written in first person POV of Nevada Baylor the MC.CharactersThe charcters in this book is what made me love the book the way I do. They all haave amazing different personalities. They are fun and wise and make great decisions when the time comes. I love that the book did not revolve only around Nevada and Mad Rogan but also her family and work was blended perfectly. Her thoughts were not cringy and annoying but calculating and fun. I love Mad Rogan, he is everything Tessy said he will be.PlotDo not let the cover decieve you, this is not a romance novel, The total number of kisses in this book is three, the remaining part of the book is action packed, filled with plotting, scheming and politics. The book is not predictable, the only predictable thing in the book is the romance which the cover and synopsis have already made clear."}, {"userName": "Helen 2.0", "userReviewDate": "Apr 27, 2017", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/39575951-helen-2-0", "userReview": "Buddies, who's up for a White Hot BR on the release date?????? Let me know!----------------------\nThere was a fluid, magnetic grace in the way he moved. All those muscles I had been admiring yesterday were just a by-product of his journey toward his goal. And the goal was power. Raw, lethal power. All of him, his incredible strength, his blinding speed, his flexibility, dexterity, and stamina blended together to achieve an almost feral savagery. Tiny hairs stood on the backs of my arms. It was like watching a god of primal human violence dance, and I couldn't look away.\nUmmmm...... wow.WOW. Anyone else feel a little hot and flustered?Please nobody stone me for heresy when I admit this: Burn for Me is the first and only Ilona Andrews I've ever read. (I'm sorry! I'll do better!)But color me impressed. Burn for Me contains the sort of pure storytelling and character-building skill that makes you face unapologetic psychopaths and absolutely fall head-over-heels. Exhibit A: Mad Rogan. aka The Scourge of Mexico, aka the dragon, aka bae\n\"Is that why you joined the military? To get away from your family?\"\"I joined because they told me I could kill without being sent to prison and be rewarded for it.\"\nWhat's the obsession with a mass-murdering megalomaniac? Well. I can't really explain it. Nobody's forgiving his homicidal tendencies because Rogan is mad hot. The Andrews couple infuses his character with a whole lot of spicy darkness but just enough light to melt all readers instantly. The master authoring behind Rogan's character alone convinced me that the Andrews are a winning team.Also.The whole cast of Burn for Me, major and supporting, is fleshed out in loving detail and complexity. Each character has a depth that makes you constantly second-guess what you assumed upon first introduction. It's hard to guess the true villains and heroes of the story.I especially enjoyed the attention given to minor players. For example, Nevada's family didn't exist purely for advice and support of the main heroine; they all had personal motivations and backgrounds. This bonus really added to the credibility of world & plot. Not that I'll ever care as much about anyone like I do about Mad Rogan."}, {"userName": "Nenia \u2728 Queen of Literary Trash, Protector of Out-of-Print Gems, Khaleesi of Bodice Rippers, Mother of Smut, the Unrepentant, Breaker of Convention \u2728 Campbell", "userReviewDate": "May 13, 2017", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/2190064-nenia-queen-of-literary-trash-protector-of-out-of-print-gems-khalees", "userReview": "Instagram || Twitter || Facebook || Amazon || PinterestI read this book for the Unapologetic Romance Readers' New Years 2017 Reading Challenge.

The heroine, the villainous antihero, the magic system, the world-building...it was all so, so good. Reading this transported me to childhood again, when I could completely immerse myself in fantasy stories and they all felt real -Except no childhood fantasy story ever had Mad Rogan in it.(Phwooooar!) BURN FOR ME is the first in the Hidden Legacy series, which takes place in an alternate universe where a magic serum has given various human beings X-Men-like abilities. Some control the elements, some control minds. Nevada Baylor, a private investigator, has the ability to discern truth. And right now, she's hunting down a powerful pyrokinetic named Adam Pierce who seems to want to set the whole city of Houston up in flames.Mad Rogan is a powerful tactile who can level large buildings with the same ease that he can peel splinters of a chopstick, layer by layer. (And that's not the only thing he'd like to peel layer by layer *cough*) He's after Adam, too, although when he meets Nevada, he decides that he might just be after her, as well. You know, while he's at it.The result is a tug-of-war between the various powerful mages, called Primes, with poor Nevada bouncing around between them like a ping-pong ball, as she dodges gunfire, actual fire, mutant turf wars, and the sexual advances of a very attractive, possibly sociopathic telekinetic, all the while trying to prevent the destruction of the entire world. One of my friends recommended this book when she found out that I love villainous heroes, and Mad Rogan definitely fit the bill in that regard. Goddamn, that man is the type of bad that inspires X-rated fanfiction. He had some amazing lines, and some super steamy scenes with Nevada. Did I maybe skim ahead a bit, looking for said scenes? No, no of course not. That would be sacrilege. (Maybe.) It's so hard to find urban fantasy novels with romance that don't put the world-building in the backseat. In BURN FOR ME, it's front and center, and instead of detracting from the romantic elements, it makes them that much more stronger and compelling.I want to say more about this book, but to be honest, I wouldn't know where to begin. I could tell you that the secondary characters are just as colorful as the ones in a Stephanie Plum novel, and I could tell you that reading this book gave me those same \"this is good fantasy\" vibes as I got from His Dark Materials and Harry Potter. I could tell you that Mad Rogan has a place in my exclusive heroes hall of fame, and I could tell you that I am insanely jealous of my friends who seem to have acquired ARCs for not just book 2 (which isn't out yet) but also book 3 (which also isn't out yet). I could tell you all these things, but you should probably just read the book for yourself.Also, for all you people saying Mad Rogan is yours? Back off, he's mine.

And I'm not using the word \"hot\" based on the cover (ugly and misleading) or the title (deliberately equivocal ?). I had a blast reading \"Burn for me\": it was fun, it was fast-paced, it was intriguing and, let's be honest, pretty sexy! I shouldn't be surprised though! There is something extremely familiar, cozy and addictive about the Andrews' writing. Their prose is simple, their dialogues either informative, or hilarious, their characters very complex and realistic and there is always crazy things happening !I went into the series not knowing what to expect but fearing that it would copy what made Kate Daniels the Andrews' best UF work for me ! But I couldn't be more wrong ! True, there were some familiar tropes and sometimes the same catchphrases. And true, the plot is developed on an investigation. But the world, the magic and the characters are completely new and totally exhilarating. Nevada Baylor, main character and private investigator, conducts the family business and works on small cases (fraud, cheating or missing spouses...) while keeping a low profile about her magic and abilities. Nevada was definitely not sassy, kickass and a war machine like Kate (thank God!) but maaaan I ended up rooting for her. She's super funny, extremely clever and perceptive, loyal and absolutely not perfect ! Just my type of heroine !! Mad Rogan was interesting and unsettling (and definitely not a copy of Curran, despite being just as strong-headed, dangerous and determined). And don't get me started on Nevada's crazy family (Grandma Frida is hilarious!). I just loved how all the characters evolved and the hints to more development in the sequels. The investigation was brilliantly lead. Which wasn't very surprising considering that Ilona and Andrews are extremely thorough in their research. However, the worldbuilding might be the least exciting aspect of the book. The world isn't particularly original : it's basically our world and our era and what stands out, is that some individuals possess magical abilities. So this is more like an X-men world where the strongest mutants (Primes) are wealthy, powerful, hold important positions but have mutual agreements with normal humans (law enforcement, politicians...), abide by the normal laws while resolving their conflicts internally. The different types of magics (elemental, mental and arcane) were very well explored and the way the magic was channeled, amplified or contained (Arcane circles) strongly reminded me of Transmutation Circles in Fullmetal Alchemist ! <3Last but not least... the ROMANCE was smoldering and extremely engrossing ! Oh my... It's neither cute nor fluffy. It's just very consistent with the world Ilona Andrews crafted : wild, intense and dangerous. And totally immersive. But let me warn you though, for those who are only interested in the \"Fantasy\" aspect, Burn for me was pretty heavy on sexual attraction, fantasies and sensations. Proceed at your own risk ! ;) Personally, I really enjoyed the romantic aspect (despite not being a Romance reader), but a detail bothered me (and always bothers me in UF) : male representation and how anything male characters say or do is instantly sexualized. If you're interested in a better insight of the basement scene, from Mad Rogan's POV, Gordon obliged :http://www.ilona-andrews.com/rogan-po...http://www.ilona-andrews.com/rogan-bu...ConclusionAll in all, Burn for Me was an exciting ride and an excellent first book in the series! I had a great time discovering the different leads and ramifications of Nevada's investigation, the different magical powers and witnessing her interactions with her family, Mad Rogan and pretty much everyone in the book! I recommend for UF (with a significant romantic touch) lovers !"}, {"userName": "Angela", "userReviewDate": "Feb 28, 2014", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/4255477-angela", "userReview": "November 2016 Re-read: This gets better and better each time.

I still have questions about the world-building, but I trust that it'll be further explored in future books. However, on a re-read I've noticed things that I simply didn't the first time (or that I've forgotten since I read it the first time). I was surprised to read so much nuance into things, and see little bits that weren't ... didn't seem significant before. I still want more Mad Rogan. And if Nevada doesn't want him, I gladly volunteer as tribute.29 June 2015: $1.99 on Kindle9 June 2015: $1.99 on Kindle18 March 2015: 0.99 on Kindle - if you haven't read this book - GET IT!! This is an amazing deal on one of my favorite authors.It's hard for favorite authors, they have so much expectation to live up to. Ever since I picked up Magic Bites several years ago, I've been in love with everything I've ever read by Ilona Andrews. Some a slight bit more than others, but always absolutely enthralled and excited for more. They've built these amazingly imaginative worlds that I just want to go live in. So Burn for Me had a high bar set for it when I first started it. And it, mostly, lived up to the level of expectation I'd put on this new world and characters.I'm just going to go ahead and get my one quibble out of the way - the world-building wasn't as solid as I was hoping. Oh, all the pieces are there; ready to be molded and explained, ready to be doled out bit by bit to make me see the bigger picture....but here, and now, I was left floundering a bit. I have questions that I felt like should have been answered. And maybe they were - maybe this is all me, and not the book (in which case I'll eat my criticism), but I stumbled a few times trying to figure out the exact rules.You see, a serum was developed a couple of hundred years ago and it gave people magical abilities. Of course, we humans didn't think about something so trivial as repercussions. Our motto is, after all, More power. Some short (I assume anyway) time later those pesky consequences started to show up and the serum use was curtailed (I think). So now you have magic users trying to hold onto the magic, mating with other magic users, creating dynasties - or Houses - that hold the power of magic within the cities. I got the feeling that magic abilities were supposed to be fairly rare in this society, because it's been so concentrated and bred to exclusion; and yet it seemed like every person we met had some sort of magical ability. It confused me. Are the magic users rare? Or common? If they're rare, then I get the point of technology still being pretty much where we are - complete with smartphones, tablets, automobiles etc., but if they're as common as our meetings seem to suggest then I have to wonder why the heck technology has developed as much as it has. I would have thought there'd be some stronger effect on the development of our world in the last couple centuries with magic having such a stronghold on the citizens. It's one small thing, but it niggled at the back of my mind the entire time I was reading. I think that I'm right in saying magic users are rare - despite what we see - but I'd love to get a better idea of the ratio of magic-users to regular-folk.Now onto everything I loved!1. Nevada Baylor: She's so utterly loyal, snarky, sarcastic, grounded, and fun that I loved her immediately. When her back is against a wall, she doesn't go down without a fight. She sticks to her guns, has her morals and ethics, and is just a genuinely good person. I like her so much that her obvious specialness didn't even bother me. It was reasonable that it snuck up on her, and I'm incredibly interested in seeing how this develops in this world.2. The Baylor Family: Ilona Andrews have always done an amazing job writing realistic relationships - not just romances, but also friends and family. The interactions between Nevada and her mother, grandmother, cousin Bern, and sisters is so utterly realistic. There is obvious love and comfort between them. The good-natured ribbing and joking made me laugh more than once.3. \"Mad\" Rogan: I love him. So sue me. I know there's something wrong with me that I am so ridiculously attracted to someone that's so freaking powerful, arrogant, cocky, and borderline sociopathic (c'mon, it's not like you couldn't have seen this coming what with my love for Barrons - who is the uber-alphahole). I don't care. He's sexy, and I want more of him.4. The Magic System: The magic history is fascinating - I simply want more of it. All the different levels of magic users, the Houses that rule...well, the world, and the different types of magic that's possible. It's so interesting. I can't wait to see everything expanded in the next books.5. Storyline: I have to admit that I was sold from the first moment that the flames started to fly. Though we knew the antagonist for much of the book, it was clear that there was more to the story - and I was anxious to find out what was going on. I do think that the reveal at the end was slightly anti-climactic, revealed almost in passing. But it does set up the over-arcing plot quite nicely.6. The Slow-Burn Romance: I'm a huge sucker for this romantic development. There's a bit of a pride-and-prejudice story here, enemies-to-lovers, and a whole hell of a lot of sexual tension. SO MUCH sexual tension. It's killing me actually. I need MORE. Right now there is a huge imbalance of power, but Ilona Andrews has never let me down in that regard so I'm really excited to see this relationship develop even more.I hope the next book is coming out soon. I always anxiously await the next Ilona Andrews' book...and I can already see that this series is going to be the same. I'm clearly already obsessed.

I love Ilona Andrews! As much as I do, I can't say that I am as hard-core as 99.9% of my GR friends are. My lovely Sarah, who is the leader of the gang of insanely IA knowledgeable flock of Kate Daniels-like kick ass awesome readers, persuaded me to read this book with very bodice-ripper looking cover. I have to admit, I had been afraid to read it, because I didn't want to be disappointed by the Gordons,, thinking this would be a PNR... After all the bad-ass UF of theirs I love so much, I didn't want to ruin the image I have created of them in my mind.. Well, Sarah and Maria spelled me and I was left with no choice but to give in.I loved Nevada! I loved the Family! I loved the world! I loved the story! I am very unsure when it comes to Rogan... As a book character and a dude that could take care of business, kick butt and look pretty, he is perfect. As a human being, a love (not sex - he is sexy as sin!) interest, as a boyfriend material, as someone who might treat you as an equal and an autonomous human being, or just as a good person with reasonable amount of morality and empathy, Rogan is a TOTAL DUD!!! He is obviously a sociopath, most probably a product of both his birth and his environment, and as appealing, sexy and intoxicating such people can be, they could be just as detrimental and destructive to a girl's life and soul... Nevada lives in a Houston run by powerful Magical families, in a world where magic isn't to rare, but powerful magic is, and those who have it marry and reproduce with the sole reason to produce magically viable offspring... In order to genetically insure that, socially\u200b the more magic you have, the more influence and opportunities you and your family could achieve. Nevada is considered to be magically weak, while Rogan is a Prime - the highest level of magically powerful one can be. He also is a product of generations of Primes, making his pedigree very desirable, his family powerful and very, very rich! Nevada is a private investigator struggling to keep a roof over her family's heads... Rogan is an ex-military, hard-ass, gorgeous, antisocial, uber-rich sociopath. Nevada is a sweet, determined, smart, kind of cute, hard-working, family oriented, special snowflake... The two of them have nothing in common, but a crazy pyromancer Prime is running amuck in the city and Rogan and Nevada have a vested interest in stopping and capturing him. This makes them very reluctant partners and the proximity makes for some sparks and sexual tension. I get it. We are all easily seduced by a hard body and alpha male vibes. There are those men whose sexapeal can play havock on our hormonal balance and make us stupid with lust. I also get the bad-boy appeal and it becomes Amplified by battle magic and natural dominance. Which makes me truly empathize with Nevada, who obviously has a good head on her shoulders and well honed instincts, because although she feels her physical awareness of all that male goodness, she also has the good sense to recognize who and what Rogan is and tries to figure out the best way to proceed... And all this is on personal level. The rest is them trying to stay alive while the crazy pyromancer Prime runs around destroying stuff... Good times all around \ud83d\ude09This book was neither what I expected nor what the cover advertises. It is a story of a boy meets girl, then he meets her family, there are explosions, humor, snark, some kissing, fire, more fire, armored vehicles, and boy feeling ready for a challenge... It is a very fast read and is very reader-friendly. The magic system is easy to understand and it flows seamlessly with the setting. As always, the side-characters bring that extra umph that makes an IA story a real treat to read. I would recommend it to all who love a fun tale told tongue in cheek with plenty of moments for laughing, sweating, flushing or blushing. I think there is a little for every taste in here\ud83d\ude42. Don't be mislead by the cover - it is a bit of a false advertising!Now I wish you all Happy Reading and many more wonderful books to come!!!"}, {"userName": "Tadiana \u2729Night Owl\u263d", "userReviewDate": "Mar 18, 2015", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/8734459-tadiana-night-owl", "userReview": "Updated review, posted initially at www.fantasyliterature.com:The husband-wife author team of Ilona Andrews began their new Hidden Legacy urban fantasy series in 2014 with Burn for Me.In an alternative reality to our world, a serum discovered in 1863 unleashed people\u2019s magical talents. As the powerful and rich sought the serum as a new way for their families to gain more power and wealth, others realized the potential it raised for chaos and destruction, and locked it away \u2013 too late. Magical talent now runs in families, with magical dynasties forming, and the strength of a person\u2019s magic becoming a major factor in whom they might marry in these families. The most powerful magical users are known as Primes.Nevada Baylor has magical powers \u2013 among other things, she always knows when someone is lying \u2013 but Nevada isn\u2019t a member of a powerful family. In fact, she does her best to stay under the radar and hide her powers from the world. She\u2019s the head of her family\u2019s private investigation firm, taking low-level jobs like investigating cheating spouses. They\u2019re staying afloat, though not by much, and when the head of their parent company forces her to take on a high profile and highly dangerous job, bringing in Adam Pierce, the man responsible for an arson that left an off-duty police officer dead, without involving the police, Nevada knows her family business isn\u2019t likely to survive\u2026 and neither is she.If that weren\u2019t bad enough, it turns out that one of the most notorious magical Primes in the country, Connor \u201cMad\u201d Rogan, is determined to find his relative, a teenage boy who assisted Adam Pierce with the arson. Rogan is a sexy billionaire with Prime telekinetic powers, sufficient to destroy a city. And Nevada is in Mad Rogan\u2019s way. He kidnaps Nevada and uses his secondary power of telepathy to try find out what she knows about Pierce.Telepathy was will based. My magic was also will based, and in all of the time I had been alive, I had never met a person on whom it hadn\u2019t worked\u2026 He might be a dragon, but if he tried to swallow me whole, I\u2019d make him choke. I scooted forward, trying to get as comfortable in my restraints as I could, and liked my dry lips. \u201cOkay, tough guy. Let\u2019s see what you\u2019ve got.\u201dOnce Mad Rogan and Nevada each realize they can\u2019t make the other go away, they begin to reluctantly cooperate as they try to reel in their targets, while trying to figure out why the arson was committed. It doesn\u2019t make it easier for Nevada that she\u2019s so strongly attracted to Rogan, when she doesn\u2019t want any part of his world.While I didn\u2019t find the world-building in Burn for Me as complex and compelling as Ilona Andrews\u2019 Kate Daniels series, there are compensating factors that made Burn for Me an exciting read. The power exercised by magical families and the different types of magical talents were intriguing. Nevada\u2019s family, which includes an ex-military mother whose magical power is never missing her target and a crusty mechanic grandmother, along with assorted siblings, adds a nice humorous touch to the story.\"Mom?\" Mother turned to Grandmother.\"What?\"\"She's going to lunch with her kidnapper!\"\"Take a picture for me,\" Grandma said.\"This family will put me in an early grave,\" my mother growled. \"I'm coming with you... We'll take the van and the Barrett.\"\"Would the Barrett be enough?\" Grandma Frida asked. \"Isn't he supposed to bounce bullets off his chest?\"\"It fires .50 cal at twice the speed of sound. It will hit him before he ever hears the shot.\" My mother crossed her arms. \"I'd like to see him bounce that off his chest.\"Mad Rogan is a bit of a clich\u00e9 \u2013 the rich, hot, powerful but emotionally damaged guy \u2013 but he grew on my over the course of the book.. He seems irretrievably damaged at first, but gradually more layers to his personality and past are disclosed. By the end of the book he\u2019s a sympathetic character. The mystery on which the plot is based was a fairly good one by urban fantasy standards. I found it less convoluted and easier to follow than some of the Kate Daniels plots. There was an unexpected twist that could have been better handled or foreshadowed, but overall the plot holds together well and is an enjoyable ride with some fun tongue-in-cheek humor and a confident, determined heroine.I recommend Burn for Me for fans of romantic urban fantasies. The second book in this series, White Hot, is coming out in October 2015 May 2017, and I\u2019ll absolutely be reading it as soon as I can get my hands on a copy.****************Prior review:The husband-wife author team of Ilona Andrews is starting up a new urban fantasy series as the Kate Daniels series appears to be winding down (maybe?), and it's interesting to compare and contrast this book to Kate's series:World-building: Simpler (at least at first glance) and less complex than the Magic Bites series. Some people have magical powers due to some scientific mucking around about 150 years ago. Sure, there are a lot of variations in those magical powers. But no shapeshifters (no Curran! D:). No vampires, or exotic wacked-out magical non-human or not-quite-human creatures. No magical waves eating up the buildings and turning off your car or gun. I kinda missed it.Heroine: Nevada is a reasonably kickass kind of main character, but doesn't rise to Kate's level. Which makes sense; you don't want to repeat yourself too much as an author, but still. It's interesting that both Nevada and Kate are in the private investigation business. It does fit well in the plot, but a little more distinction would've been nice. Nevada's magical powers were a fun twist, though.She also has a great family, which really adds a nice touch to the plot.Romantic interest: No Curran! D:*sighs* Okay, I actually like Mad Rogan. He's hot, and he knows what he wants and goes for it. He seems irretrievably damaged at first, but by the end of the book I felt like I understood who he was, and I'm rooting for him and Nevada. I also liked that the authors are taking their time with this relationship--although there was that one really seriously sexy kiss . . .Plot/Bad guys: A plus. This one was a little less convoluted and easier to follow than some of the Kate plots. There was an interesting twist that could have been better handled or foreshadowed, IMO. But overall I really enjoyed it. It held together well.Final assessment: I liked it better than the first Kate Daniels book, Magic Bites, about the same as the second book, but not quite as well as the third. I think the Andrews have learned something about writing books as they've gone alone.Content advisory: Scattered F-bombs and some sexual content (kisses only, but. Um. Yeah.).April 2015 buddy read with the Ilona Andrews Addicts (IAA) group. ************Initial reaction: Well, I sucked that book down in pretty much record time.

Munoz, a stocky man twice my age, peered at the security footage. He\u2019d watched it twice already.\u201cI couldn\u2019t let him put her into the car,\u201d I said from my spot in the chair. My shoulder hurt and the handcuffs on my hands kept me from rubbing it. Being in close proximity to cops filled me with anxiety. I wanted to fidget, but fidgeting would make me look nervous.\u201cYou were right,\u201d Munoz said and tapped the screen, paused on John Rutger reaching for his wife. \u201cThat right there is your dead give-away. The man\u2019s caught with his pants down and he doesn\u2019t say, \u2018Sorry, I fucked up.\u2019 He doesn\u2019t beg for forgiveness or gets angry. He goes cold and tries to get his wife out of the picture.\u201d\u201cI didn\u2019t provoke him. I didn\u2019t put my hands on him either, until he tried to kill me.\u201d\u201cI see that.\u201d He turned to me. \u201cThat\u2019s a C-2 taser you\u2019ve got there. You do know range on those things is fifteen feet?\u201d\u201cI didn\u2019t want to take chances. His magic looked electrical to me and I thought he might block the current.\u201dMunoz shook his head. \u201cNo, this is Bellicus school. Courtesy of US Army. This guy is a vet.\u201d\u201cAh.\u201d That explained why Rutger went flat. Dealing with adrenaline was nothing new to him. How in the world did Bern miss it in the background check? When I got home, my cousin and I would have to have words.A uniformed cop stuck his head into the door and handed my license back to Munoz. \u201cShe checks out.\u201dMunoz unlocked my cuffs, took them off, and handed me my purse and camera. My cell and my wallet followed. \u201cWe have your statement and we took your memory card. You\u2019ll get it back later. Go home, put some ice on that neck.\u201dYes. I grinned at him. \u201cAre you going to tell me not to leave town, Sarge?\u201dMunoz gave me a \u201cyet another smartass\u201d look. \u201cNo. You went up against a military grade mage for a grand. If you need the money that bad, you probably can\u2019t afford the gas.\u201dThree minutes later I climbed into my five year old Mazda minivan. The paperwork described Mazda\u2019s color as \u201cgold.\u201d Everyone else said it was \u201ckind of champagne\u201d or \u201csort of beige.\u201d Coupled with unmistakable mom car lines, the minivan made for a perfect surveillance car. Nobody paid it any mind. I once followed a guy for two hours in it on a nearly deserted highway, and when the insurance company later showed him the footage demonstrating that his knee worked just fine as he shifted gears in his El Camino, he was terribly surprised.I turned the mirror. A big purple bruise blossomed on my neck and the top of my left shoulder, like someone took a handful of blueberries and rubbed it all over me. An equally bright red welt marked my jaw on the left side. I sighed, readjusted the mirror, and headed home.Some easy job this turned out to be. At least I didn\u2019t have to go to the hospital. I grimaced. The welt decided it didn\u2019t like me grimacing. Ow.Baylor Agency started as a family business. We still were a family business, technically, except we were owned by someone else now, but they mostly left us alone. We had only three rules. Rule #1: we stayed bought. Once a client hired us, we were loyal to the client. Rule #2: we didn\u2019t break the law. It was a good rule. It kept us out of jail and safe from litigation. And Rule #3, the most important one of all: at the end of the day we still had to be able to look our reflection in the eye. I filed today under Rule #3 day. Maybe I was crazy and John Rutger would\u2019ve taken his wife home and begged her forgiveness on bended knee. But at the end of the day, I had no regrets and I didn\u2019t have to worry about whether I did the right thing and whether Liz\u2019s two children would ever see their mother.Their father was a different story, but he was no longer my problem. He made that mess all on his own.I cleared the evening traffic on I-290, heading north-west, and turned off south. A few minutes later I pulled up in front of our warehouse. Bern\u2019s beat-up black Civic sat in the parking lot, next to mom\u2019s blue Honda Element. Oh good. Everyone was home.I parked, went to the door, and punched the code into the security system. The door clicked open, I let myself in and paused for a second to hear the reassuring click of the lock sliding home behind me.When you entered the warehouse from this door, it looked just like an office. We built temporary walls with sheetrock, installed some glass panels and laid down high traffic beige carpet. That gave us three office rooms on the left side and a break room and a large conference room on the right. The drop ceiling completed the illusion.I stepped into my office, put the purse and the camera on the desk, and sat in my chair. I really should do a write up, but I didn\u2019t feel like it. I\u2019d do it later.The office was soundproof. Around me everything was quiet. A familiar faint scent of grapefruit oil in the oil warmer floated to me. The oils were my favorite luxury. I inhaled the fragrance. I was home.I survived. Had I hit my head on the wall when Rutger had thrown me, I could\u2019ve died today. Right now I could be dead instead of sitting here in my office, twenty feet from my home. My mom could be in the morgue, identifying me on a slab. My heart pounded in my chest. Nausea crept up, squeezing my throat. I leaned forward and concentrated on breathing. Deep calm breaths. I just had to let myself work through it.In and out. In and out.Slowly the anxiety receded.In and out.Okay.I got up, crossed the office to the break room, opened the door in the back, and stepped into the warehouse. To the right was a small area for coats and shoes. A luxuriously wide hallway stretched left and right. Above me thirty foot ceilings soared. After we had to sell the house and moved into the warehouse, mom and dad had considered putting up a legitimate drop ceiling, but instead we ended up just building one large wall separating this section of the warehouse \u2013 our living space \u2013 from Grandma\u2019s garage so we didn\u2019t have to heat or air condition the entire twenty-two thousand square feet of the warehouse. The rest of the walls had occurred organically, which was a gentle euphemism for we had put them up as needed with whatever material was handy.If Mom saw me, I wouldn\u2019t get away without a thorough medical exam. All I wanted to do was take a shower and eat some food. This time of the day she was usually with Grandma, helping her work. If I were really quiet, I could just sneak into my room. I padded down the hallway. Think sneaky thoughts\u2026 Be invisible\u2026 Hopefully, nothing attention-attracting was going on.\u201cI\u2019ll kill you!\u201d a familiar high voice howled from the right.Damn it. Brandi, of course. My youngest sister was in a rare form judging by the pitch.\u201cThat\u2019s real mature!\u201d And that was Kitty, the sixteen year old. Two years older than Brandi and nine years younger than me.I had to break this up before mom came over to investigate. I sped up down the hallway toward the media room.\u201cAt least I\u2019m not a dumb ho who has no friends!\u201d\u201cAt least I\u2019m not fat!\u201d\u201cAt least I am not ugly!\u201dNeither of them was fat, ugly, or promiscuous. They both were complete drama queens, and if I didn\u2019t break this party up fast, mom would come to investigate.continue reading: http://www.ilona-andrews.com/snippet-...

Thank you for permission. \u201cYou\u2019re doing that thing again.\u201d\u201cWhat thing?\u201d\u201cThe one where you think you can tell me what to do.\u201d \n Once again Ilona Andrews blew my mind and I loved it! An amazing world where the discovery of the Osiris serum resulted in people having various kinds of magic abilities and now a century and a half later the world is ruled by the Primes, those who has the strongest magic.  \n \u201cI really would like to know,\u201d he said with genuine curiosity. \u201cThe next time I kill someone, I\u2019d like to do it in a way that doesn\u2019t freak you out.\u201d\u201cHow about you don\u2019t kill anybody for a little bit?\u201d\u201cI can\u2019t make that promise.\u201d \n I loved Nevada. She\u2019s smart, so loyal to her family, she\u2019s tough, feisty and sarcastic. She has a rare magic, she\u2019s a truthseeker which means she can tell when someone is lying. She doesn\u2019t think she has a lot of power but I think she\u2019s more powerful than she knows. Her family business is a detective agency and they all believe in justice. Nevada will do anything to protect her family even take a case where she needs to bring in an evil pyrokinetic Prime, Adam Pierce, who might just kill her. And it seems the only person who can help her stay alive is the powerful Prime, Mad Rogan, who just kidnapped her to try get information out of her. The only problem is she\u2019s never before felt the intense attraction she feels for Rogan and she can\u2019t decide whether she should run away or surrender to their intense attraction.  \n\n \u201cFor example, if you\u2019re terrified of snakes, repeated handling of them will cure it.\u201dAha. \u201cI\u2019m not handling your snake.\u201dHe grinned. \u201cBaby, you couldn\u2019t handle my snake.\u201dIt finally sank in. Mad Rogan, the Huracan, had just made a pass at me. After he casually almost strangled a woman in public. \n\n Connor \u201cMad\u201d Rogan is one of the most powerful Prime\u2019s alive and feared by everyone. He\u2019s used to having his orders obeyed and I loved how Nevada kept refusing him. I loved this sexy alpha Prime who comes across as heartless and a bit of a psychopath who wants to kill everyone who stands in his way. I loved how intrigued Rogan was with Nevada and how he cared about her safety.  \n \u201cI have nothing to prove to you, Rogan.\u201d\u201cBut now I have something to prove to you,\u201d he said. \u201cI promise you, I will win, and by the time I\u2019m done, you won\u2019t walk, you\u2019ll run to jump into my bed.\u201d\u201cDon\u2019t hold your breath,\u201d I told him. \n The intense chemistry between them was SCORCHING!!!!! I loved how Nevada stood up to Rogan, shutting doors in his face, hanging up when he phoned and the hilarious banter between them \u2013 it was ALL TERRIFIC ;-D I also loved how different he was with her at times, especially near the end, teasing and seductive, trying to get her into bed. Luckily Nevada is made of stronger stuff and she kept on refusing him even though he made her knees weak. I can\u2019t wait to see what happens next with them and if Rogan will prove her wrong, that he actually is the perfect man for her ;-)  \n \u201cMy mother was looking at your head through the scope of one while we were eating lunch. We need to find Adam Pierce before my mother shoots him or my grandmother runs him over with a tank.\u201d \n I loved Nevada\u2019s family! They are all a bit eccentric but that just made me love them even more, especially her grandmother. And their loyalty to one another is so wonderful.  The story was fantastically paced, gripping from the get-go with intriguing plots, secret villains and so action-packed with all the explosions, gunfights, magic fights and car chases. SO FREAKING AWESOME!  I swear Ilona Andrews can write no wrong. All their books are fantastic and they\u2019ve written another brilliant book.

The world has magic in it to which only a few are granted, and to which an even smaller number are known as Primes (the super powerful). Houses made up of primes are what makes the world go round, as they've taken over sections of the world and are basically the government and controlling forces.Regarding the cover, it looks like a generic paranormal romance that you'd find in a supermarket bin. I don't mind the cover as much as many do, but want to point out it's definitely not a generic PR - it's Urban Fantasy all the way like the Kate Daniels series, of course with a truly yummy male lead.Nevada as the main character works well. Loved her personality, realism, humor, and how the authors gave her an existing family element that wasn't annoying. I also liked her unique ability and the private detective firm.Fortunately Ilona Andrews writing style is epic as always, so this book flies by and is difficult to put down.Only thing really bugging me about this book is that the sequel has been delayed and we have to wait until 2017 for it now.Rogan is an epic male lead - Curran won my heart with the Kate Daniels series, but Rogan is a strong contender. He's fun, powerful, determined...seriously, heart-throbbing. It's not a \"sex\" book but there's definitely some steam, especially a particular power scene.Magic makes the best fantasy worlds, and here isn't an exception as the author branches out to creatively give us unique powers.
