We find stories of all genres ranging from Kirstin Pulioff's tale of a young boy and girl unearthing a deadly buried treasure, to Yelle Hughes' detailed account of a journalist's sexual experience while interviewing a porn star. Alan Hardy's sad depiction of a marriage gone stale also deals with sexual frustration.Criminal acts, both present and past, abound: Iain Parke's Lala Salaama is masterful with its gruesome depiction of the methodical butchering of a human body.Ghosts, spirits and vampires make an appearance in quite a few stories. Susan Hawthorne's description of how the spirit of a long-dead boyfriend takes over the body of a younger man in order to entertain his now elderly lover is captivating.Each story had the power to transport the reader to another reality and to leave strong imprints of each character. Well done ASMG authors! I bow to the talent in all of you."}, {"userName": "Christoph Fischer", "userReviewDate": "Jul 11, 2013", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/13998364-christoph-fischer", "userReview": "\"A World of Possibility\" is a wonderful selection of short stories of a remarkably consistent high quality of writing throughout the entire book.Always unsure what you get from an anthology that includes unknown writers I was glad to be captivated by the opening piece, \"The Jumper\", and the mystery what said jumper represented in the story. The book takes us through worlds past and present, into the minds of a killer, victims of abuse, to a possibly haunted Inn, into the past of shipping at Cap Cod in the 1869 or to Germany after WWII. Not one of the stories failed to grab my attention, something that I find rare in anthologies and which I accredit to good editing and selection processes. The situations described are inspired, captivating and provide amazing entertainment as well as food for thought.I have noted down several of the names in the hope to find more of their work in novel form, my personally preferred genre.This is an excellent showcase of writing talent and I wish all contributors the very best for their promising futures.Highly recommended."}, {"userName": "Hilary West", "userReviewDate": "Jul 07, 2013", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/8386398-hilary-west", "userReview": "I was knocked out by the sheer aptitude displayed in this collection of stories. It is a truly inspired piece of work from all concerned. The variety of tales alone is something fresh and engaging and the scope is breathtaking, from including porn stars to a modern day vampire. Hats off to ASMSG, a group of writers of much talent and promise. Everyone should read these tales."}, {"userName": "Kirstin Pulioff", "userReviewDate": "Jul 01, 2013", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/11281401-kirstin-pulioff", "userReview": "What a wonderful collection of stories, showcasing the talents of many new authors. The stories range, as do the emotions and visuals they invoke.

I might add that nothing in this collection is average, but rather polarizing. Each story is either amazing or awful with little in between."}, {"userName": "Graham Downs", "userReviewDate": "Aug 09, 2013", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/8793190-graham-downs", "userReview": "As a collection of short stories, I found A World of Possibility to be a mixed bag. Some of these stories were quite good. Some of them were stories that I would never have chosen to read, but they turned out to be rather okay. And some of them weren't worth the time it took to read them.This last category included stories that suffered from mostly bad editing, weak storylines, or both. I guess that's the risk you take with any kind of anthology.I also found it really unfortunate that the formatting of the ebook edition that I read (from Scribd) left a lot to be desired. Just by way of example, the Table of Contents was there, but it was completely useless. It contained six chapters, but those chapters referred to a single story, starting about 70% of the way through the book. And AFTER the sixth chapter, there were another good five or six stories. It made it very difficult for me to judge how long any given story was, or how long it might take me to finish it (important when I only have a finite amount of time in my reading session, and don't want to have to end it in the middle of a story)!Similarly, the stories themselves ran straight into one another, with no page breaks between them. I would much rather have preferred the stories to be nicely organised, with each one having its own entry in the Table of Contents.It's the little things...."}], "description": "A truly eclectic offering of short stories ranging from humorous and inspirational to dark and frightening, A World of Possibility presents the work of many authors in the group ASMSG, or Authors\u2019 Social Media Support Group, and each author\u2019s link is provided for your further review of their other work.
