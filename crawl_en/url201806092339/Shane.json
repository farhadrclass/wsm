I remember watching it with him on many occasions. The film remains one of the only positive memories I have of my old man. I was never a fan of westerns, but as a kid who desperately wanted his father's approval (approval that, I might add, would never come; he's been dead since 2011), I'd force myself to consume the things he liked in the hopes that I might become one of those things.And then I grew up and realized my father wasn't someone whose approval I should be concerned with. Still, the film adaptation of this book remains one of my favorite movies, if for no other reason than that it was something I shared with my father. The book itself is terrific and gets my highest recommendation.One final note, an inside look, if you will... People assume that when I say negative reviews don't bother me that my words are nothing but posturing. \"Of course he cares about reviews. What author doesn't?\" But I mean what I say. And I can thank my father for that. If you hate me and/or my work, that doesn't affect me in the slightest. I find some reasoning silly and others thought-provoking, but I never take reviews to heart because they are opinion not truth. I had to teach myself at an early age that truth and opinion are two different things. I had to for my own mental survival. There I was, winning writing contests and spelling bees and science fairs, and my father took every one of my successes as a slight against him. \"Oh, you think you're hot shit because you can read? Well you ain't ever gonna be shit beyond that, so enjoy your fifteen minutes.\" That's a direct quote from Dad. Classy motherfucker, huh? So what the fuck do I care if you hate me? My own father didn't like me and I turned out just fine. But keep on giving up that free real estate to me in your mind. I'll be over here paying the bills.In summation: This was my first time reading this novella and it certainly will not be my last. It's just long enough. Any more of it would have been to overstay its welcome. I might be a bit biased, though, seeing as how the book speaks to me on a personal level, but I dug it. The writing is fantastic, as well. This is so much more than a dime-store western and it deserves your attention.Final Judgment: Required reading."}, {"userName": "Checkman", "userReviewDate": "Jul 22, 2012", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/5117003-checkman", "userReview": "A classic that is more than a western. It's also a story about one of the myths of the United States - the heroic Lone Hero on the Frontier. Shane is the embodiment of the Lone Hero; the man who shares the values of civilized society, but has the destructive skills of the outlaw.He rides out of the wilderness to aid the band of pioneers and take on the land-grabbing cattle barons in a violent but satisfying bloodletting. In 2012 this is a cliche, but ,as I have pointed out in the past when reviewing older stories, Shane is the archetype. It still has a freshness because it's one of the first of it's type.In reality such men never existed. The real world is more messy. Shane is a mythical individual, but what makes Shane (the character) work so well is that Shane is told from the perspective of a young boy, or at least the memories of a young boy.The narrator is an adult, but he doesn't clutter the account with adult sensibilities. The man Shane is mythical because that is how children see the adults that they admire. There is no cynicism in Shaffer's story. It's an honest and heartfelt telling because that is how we view the world when we are young.  Now there are times the writing does verge on being pulpy such as when Shane is confronting the gunfighter brought in by the cattle baron. Here is one small sample.\u201cI\u2019m waiting, Wilson. Do I have to crowd you into slapping leather?\u201dNevertheless it's very good pulp and even though it was originally sold to Argosy magazine as a serial the story rose above it's origins - which is why it is a classic. Both the novel and the movie. Good......no make that a great story. Even if you don't like westerns try Shane. You won't be sorry."}, {"userName": "Gary", "userReviewDate": "Aug 07, 2012", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/2190708-gary", "userReview": "I read this book in high school in Sophomore English class. The teacher I had was wonderful,and she was out 8 weeks due to surgery. Thank God she was with us when we read,and discussed this book. I don't really remember the discussion in class much, but I did remember that I loved this book when I was a kid.....then after reading it the first time in 1976....I wondered why she had it on our class roster of novels to read.......so...here I am 2012,and I downloaded it onto my NOOK. I was prepared to be disappointed reading it again after all these years,and being so much older, and wiser....supposedly......Well, after finishing it last night the verdict is in.....I loved it again....I truly did.If you are not a Western novel fan....read this one anyway....it's about fighting for what you truly believe in at all costs,and defending your position on what you think is right.....not spoiling it for anyone....Shane is a role model,and a good one. A good one for young people, like Bob , the young boy in the novel....I think the teacher had us read this novel for that point..... that Shane had some things right in his way of life,and we needed to experience that. I applaud the author for a truly inspiring book for young people with a positive role model...to fight,and fight hard for that you think is right, not worrying about the ramifications of what others think about you, or what you believe in....this novel hits that nail right on the head.....I highly recommend this one. Teachers out there, use this with your students, it has a truly inspiring message,and maybe a message for us wee adults to be reminded of what's the right thing to to do,and what it means to be a \"man\" or a \"woman\" due to unsavory situations and people you have to deal with......This novel sends the message that you have to be strong and determined to truly cope with what life throws at you....Shane is truly my hero,and it made me weep to finish those last words on the last page, before bedtime.Folks, the verdict is in......read this one....truly read this one,and enjoy!"}, {"userName": "Conor", "userReviewDate": "Jan 13, 2018", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/30552336-conor", "userReview": "There's no living with a killing. There's no going back from it. Right or wrong, it's a brand, a brand that sticks. There's no going back. Now you run on home to your mother and tell her, tell her everything's alright, and there aren't any more guns in the valley.  Watched Shane for the 3rd or 4th time over the Christmas (the first time I've seen it since seeing Logan over the summer which referenced extensively) so I thought I'd drop one of my iconic not-read-the-book reviews. Shane is best remembered (by me at least) as a film with great scenes (the opening scene, the bar-fight, the final scene) but rewatching it I was struck by how well those scenes were tied together by everything else in between. The cinematography is beautiful, the characters are well-drawn and acted and the tone and feeling throughout the film is great.One of my favourite films from last year, Logan, referenced Shane quite a bit and it's easy to draw parallels between them (especially as Shane is one of the great Western archetypes and Logan was imo more a Western than a Superhero film). While it may be unfair to Logan to criticize it for falling short of an all-time great film (and I'd like to state again that Logan was a great film that does lots of brilliant stuff) there was one area I felt that Logan really suffered in the comparison and that's as a study of violence. Logan made an effort to examine the psychological impact of violence (primarily in how it haunts the Professor and Logan. This, which is a great scene, springs to mind: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=plvBE...) which is admirable but this effort was rather undermined by the constant action-movie violence especially when you have a 12 year old girl somersaulting over people and decapitating them with metal claws. Shane also deals with the psychological and philosophical consequences of violence but the more restrained violence in the film allows it to be done much more skillfully. In Shane, which has less violence than would be allowed in any modern action-oriented film the sparing use of violence makes each encounter feel truly meaningful and lends weight to the idea, without it even having to be said, that violence, and especially killing, is a serious and irreversible matter.Overall Shane's iconic scenes, sympathetic characters, beautifully shot cinematography and deftly handled plot make it a timeless classic. Even after more than 60 years and several viewings it's still one of my favourite films."}, {"userName": "Ben Loory", "userReviewDate": "Aug 02, 2010", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/171197-ben-loory", "userReview": "jesus christ, what a beautiful book. i'm tempted to call it holy. there's a part of me that wants to read it every day from now until the end of my life.Where was Shane?

And what a way to start ... I suddenly was compelled to read and watch Westerns, something I had only brief knowledge or experience in. I'm not sure why, exactly, the genre left me behind because I grew up watching Star Trek which is essentially, as Gene Roddenberry explained, \"Wagon Train to the Stars\". A lot of the same concepts and ideas in Trek apply to Western tropes as well. So I had some of the ideas ingrained in me but just never took the official plunge into the subject matter proper.So almost everyone I trust advised me to go with Shane as a starter book and I can see why. It doesn't challenge the genre, exactly, and comfortably gets you involved with the stereotypical moments you'd find in a Western. But, like The Godfather did for mob films, Shane might hit familiar beats to the modern reader but also happens to DEFINE the genre. You might be familiar with the goings-on but a true STORY, if compelling and honest, will ALWAYS deliver.So this book came as both a comfortable introduction to the Western genre as well as a comfort-food, which seems paradoxical, I know, but ... it rings true.I, of course, read some reviews of the books. I got this next quotation from Wikipedia (where factual mileage may vary) but I found it compelling:\"This was Jack Schaefer\u2019s first novel. He preferred in later years to write stories less mythic and more attuned to the real West.... Although he is little known, and the volume of his work is small, he surely ranks as one of this nation\u2019s greatest.\" -- Richard S WheelerI've noticed that in the movie world, since Unforgiven mostly, Westerns have let go of the mythic quality and approached the gritty realism and violence of the frontier. Shane seemed to embrace both: it has a mythic quality (the undefeatable, \"perfect\" stranger) but also introduces ignorant readers like me to the basics of frontier society. Sometimes it is good to have that mixture. It is entertainment after all.I didn't really touch on the manliness of this book. This book is aggressively male but, surprisingly, not in a negative or out-of-touch way. Going back to Star Trek, this story focuses on morals and a code of honor that just happens to be singularly attributed to males (the book was written in the 1940s after all). There are scenes of men viewing other men in their honorable glory getting teared up in pride. With a lesser author, it could be comical. It comes off as honest here.So there you have it. My first Western! And I will definitely be coming back for more!"}, {"userName": "ward", "userReviewDate": "Apr 22, 2007", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/66596-ward", "userReview": "This is the book I grew up with, having it read to me as a boy. It is an American classic and considered one of the great Westerns in league only with Lonesome Dove.This is THE novel from which the wester movie genre was created. The dark hero with a mixed and unstated past, the western town with a struggle raging between migrant farmers and cattle ranchers, the hired guns and dark saloons all comprise elements of this short story. This is THE story that gave birth to the image of the laconic cowboy - but does so by revealing adulthood through the eyes of the narrator, a young boy who wants to be a man and is torn between idols - the grace of his gentle but strong father and the violence and danger of an honrable but displaced drifter.The first few pages alone are one vivid and unforgetable description of Shane, an unknown cowboy as he rides up a long road in the summer sun to the shade of a tree.This is the book that taught a generation of American men, what it was to be strong and proud - and could only have been written by an American in America. It must be understood that what today may appear cliche is in fact the original gold standard from which the cliche poorly copied.I recommend this book to everyone, boys, girls, men and women. Moreover I recommend this edition. The original story being roughly 150 pages, this edition provides twice that in contextual information concerning this stories creation, its impact on American culture and the idealistic image of an american culture it represents.This book is a must read."}, {"userName": "Robin Hatcher", "userReviewDate": "Oct 20, 2016", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/3932631-robin-hatcher", "userReview": "A recent discussion with friends about the classic movie version of Shane made me decide it was time to read the book.

I've been doing historical reading on the author and history of this book. It was required reading in my high school. Don't know how long they gave us, but I was able to read it in just a few hours today. Schaefer moved to Santa Fe, New Mexico, and lived there for around 40 years. He died in 1991. There was a movie about Shane, staring Alan Ladd, and Jack Palance who also lived in Santa Fe. I've seen him there when he was living several times. It is about 50-55 miles from Albuquerque.I really enjoyed the story. Again, high school was a long time ago. If you are not a Western novel fan it is still worth the read. It's about defending your beliefs and for what is right. Shane is a role model, and a good one. A good one for young people, like Bob , the young boy in the novel. I think my teacher had us read this novel for that point--that Shane had some things right in his way of life, and we needed to experience that. I really didn't get the point as much as I should have back then, but I sure appreciate it now. Schaefer is an amazing author for a truly inspiring book for young people with a positive role model, to fight, and fight hard for what you think is right, not worrying about the ramifications of what others think about you, or what you believe in. This novel hits that nail right on the head.I highly recommend this one. It has a truly inspiring message, and maybe a message for us adults to be reminded of what's right, and what it means.

Some of these themes include man versus nature, the lone gunslinger with a checkered and mysterious past, the abuse of power and the power to control that abuse, coming of age, and pride. I found myself continually amazed at Schaefer\u2019s ability to provide such vivid descriptions while using so little language. I was also impressed with his ability to efficiently build a story around some rather profound philosophical and ethical issues without diminishing the import of those issues by editorializing or having the characters ruminate on them; the issues are presented in plain fashion and the reader is left to determine their weight and relevance based on the facts of the story. Furthermore, Shaefer is very deliberate and precise with his pacing, his organization and his structuring of the story, so that once, for example, the issue of justifiable violence is introduced, it is always present, even when it is not written about or spoken of by the characters. In brief, it\u2019s amazing how much content Shaefer packs into such a short story. Second, this story is noteworthy for what Shaefer doesn\u2019t pack into it. As a writer, Shaefer understands what a story needs to be successful: an interesting storyline, an interesting set of characters, and an interesting stage upon which everything will be acted out. As for the storyline, there is so much that is hidden from the reader, but this is what makes the story so savory. From beginning to end, the mystery of Shane is preserved. He is and remains an enigma, a cypher. In many ways, he comes to embody the mythos of the old West, a place that is both beautiful and dangerous, a place whose origins are contested and its future unclear (something also represented by the feud between the farmers, a group attempting to lay down roots, and Fletcher, the itinerant cattle baron). The true nature of the relationship between Shane and Marion is also portrayed in an ambivalent fashion. Much is said between them but even more is said in the looks and in the silences that pass between these two characters. Similarly, much of the real dialogue between Shane and Joe remains unspoken. Fletcher also remains the reclusive villain, only making a brief appearance at the end, and the true motives of why the characters do what they do (why, for example, is Wilson such a cold-blooded killer; why does Chris have a change of heart at the end?) remains vague. This makes the characters interesting because they remain individuals with private lives that readers are denied access to; it keeps the characters human and preserves their dignity, the latter of which is an important theme in the novel. To conclude, this is a wonderful novel that moves at a brisk pace, that is filled with drama and expectation, and that is superbly written. A book that everyone should read at some point."}, {"userName": "Shell The Belle ", "userReviewDate": "Nov 12, 2013", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/15880350-shell-the-belle", "userReview": "three to four stars - read this in High School when I was about 14 - loved it then - cant remember much about it now to give a proper review, but I remember liking it!!"}, {"userName": "Bob Mayer", "userReviewDate": "May 20, 2018", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/4460714-bob-mayer", "userReview": "A classic tale.

Never even heard of \"Shane.\" Seriously, where did I grow up? To get to the point, I found this tiny little western to be powerful, slightly poetic, moving and a fast, fun read. The themes were universal and full of truth. The men were men, the woman was all woman (and I mean that in the best way). I loved the narrator, a boy watching without complete understanding of why adults do the things they do, and his hero worship of his father and Shane and his great love for his mother. If you've seen a lot of cowboy movies, it's the plot won't surprise you, but this was written in 1949--so I wonder if this is one of the back-bones of the typical western-genre scripts.

I loved the simple and crisp prose, with nothing flowery or irrelevant. Shane comes into the Starretts' lives like some cowboy Mary Poppins. Is there ever any doubt that he will set things right? Of course not, because he is Shane. Joe and Marian Starrett are a breath of fresh air as far as literary couples go - respectful, hard-working, loving, strong, equally yoked and having many other qualities I'd attribute to a healthy and exemplary marriage. Marian is never belittled for being a woman and Joe is never made to be a buffoon as many paterfamilial characters are. And their son Bob loves and respects them, even after Shane shows up. Shane doesn't replace Bob's parents as his idols, Bob idolizes them equally but for different reasons, and I really liked that.A gun is just a tool. No better and no worse than any other tool, a shovel - or an axe or a saddle or a stove or anything. Think of it always that way. A gun is as good - and as bad - as the man who carries it. Remember that.Shane teaches Bob not to idolize him just because he's a man who's good with a gun, but because he's a man who wants to do good. I disagree with one of the main themes of the story, however, in that I believe that people can change despite of what they may have done/what has happened to them in the past. I understand the romantic, western quality of that sentiment, though.Grover Gardner was an excellent narrator, once again (he is fabulous in Cold Sassy Tree).And I'm starting to see a pattern in what ranks up in my 'favorites' category: True Grit, Lonesome Dove, and now Shane.

SERIOUSLY!!! you got to be kidding me, was my thought when i read the beginning.Note:i seriously think the author alluded a homosexual relationship between the father and Shane(if you've the book, you'll understand what i'm talking about).If your interested in the Old West and cowboys, go ahead and knock yourself out, but i strongly suggest you not to read it."}, {"userName": "Mikella Etchegoyen", "userReviewDate": "Nov 15, 2011", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/6966853-mikella-etchegoyen", "userReview": "Westerns are so far out of my comfort zone of genres that I didn't have many expectations at all for this book, but if I had it would have exceeded them all. There is always something different about seeing a story--that, quite possibly, has been told a hundred times over--through the eyes of a child. The charged sexual tension between the adult characters and the undercurrents of social relations between the different groups in the town are masked by the naive view of the narrator. It is a story that proves that even when children do not fully understand what they are seeing they are still the most observant creatures and can draw deep meaning from their experiences and the world around them. It was an easy, enjoyable read."}, {"userName": "V\u00edt Kota\u010dka", "userReviewDate": "Mar 26, 2018", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/25024972-v-t-kota-ka", "userReview": "[post\u0159elen\u00ed hlavn\u00edho hrdiny do boku, (hide spoiler)]"}, {"userName": "Kurt", "userReviewDate": "Sep 17, 2011", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/318324-kurt", "userReview": "I remember seeing this short novel as a kid. It was typical of what some 7th to 9th graders tended to read. It never looked too appealing to me. For one thing, I was not a reader -- unless it was an assignment, I just didn't read stuff at that age. For another, I was not really into westerns, and Shane just looked like a cheesy western story. Not judging a book by its cover (and title) was not fully ingrained into my way of thinking at that early age (actually, I still have a bit of progress to make there).So, now as a 55 year old, and after a hearty recommendation from my brother (whom I can nearly always trust in such matters), and after finding a cheap used paperback copy at the local thrift store (because my small hometown library doesn't even have a copy of this classic), I finally gave it a try. Very glad I did. A great classic story told in a beautiful, sentimental way from the viewpoint of a young boy. And it's just the right length, barely 150 pages."}, {"userName": "Tim Schneider", "userReviewDate": "May 09, 2011", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/3216767-tim-schneider", "userReview": "This one is probably a shade closer to 3 1/2 stars than three. And it may pale a bit by my having seen Alan Ladd and Jack Palance a few too many times. This isn't the stereotypical shoot 'em up western. There's action...but it's not the focus of the book. The focus is a quieter look at the myth of the west. And ultimately that's what Schaefer gives us. It's a western myth. Shane is the Demi-God who rides in and out of the lives of the mortals. Making it (their lives) better...and in some ways worse. There's a lot of development here that really can only be explained as mythic. This isn't the real west and these aren't real people acting in real ways. Shane is a force of nature and he leaves the poor people behind, ever altered by having been in his path."}, {"userName": "John", "userReviewDate": "Feb 19, 2012", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/5879465-john", "userReview": "The classic western that inspired the classic western movie. The Western Writers of America voted this the best western in the last 100 years and rightly so. A mysterious stranger comes to town with a clouded past that he does want to revisit. He falls in with a homesteader in Wyoming who's fighting off the machinations of a cattle baron. It's a pure western send-up and in Schaefer's sure hands it rolls along seamlessly. Schaefer captures the wide expanse of Wyoming's open ranges and the close knit community of a pioneering western town. I got a real sense of what life was like in the west and the drama of the mysterious forces against immoveable hired guns. Well worth a read if you want to explore a new genre."}], "description": "A stranger rode out of the heart of the great glowing West, into the small Wyoming valley in the summer of 1889. It was Shane, who appeared on the horizon and became a friend and guardian to the Starrett family at a time when homesteaders and cattle rangers battled for territory and survival. Jack Schaefer\u2019s classic novel illuminates the spirit of the West through the eyes of a young boy and a hero who changes the lives of everyone around him. Renowned artist Wendell Minor provides stunning images and a moving introduction to this new edition of Shane, the ultimate tale of the Western landscape.", "title": "Shane", "url": "http://www.goodreads.com/book/show/1072364.Shane", "average": 3.81, "cover": "https://images.gr-assets.com/books/1439444664l/1072364.jpg", "reviews": 626, "authors": [{"url": "https://www.goodreads.com/author/show/150701.Jack_Schaefer", "name": "Jack Schaefer"}], "type": ["Westerns", "Fiction", "Classics", "Historical"], "outlinks": ["http://www.goodreads.com/book/show/1072364.Shane", "http://www.goodreads.com/book/show/8637994-shane", "http://www.goodreads.com/book/show/2766994-shane", "http://www.goodreads.com/book/show/257837.Shane", "http://www.goodreads.com/book/show/29343669-shane", "http://www.goodreads.com/book/show/31210594-shane", "http://www.goodreads.com/book/show/455851.Shane", "http://www.goodreads.com/book/show/3436499-shane", "http://www.goodreads.com/book/show/8128387-shane", "http://www.goodreads.com/book/show/35163503-shane", "http://www.goodreads.com/book/show/311904.Monte_Walsh", "http://www.goodreads.com/book/show/1625129.Old_Ramon", "http://www.goodreads.com/book/show/6436212-the-canyon", "http://www.goodreads.com/book/show/2467431.Company_of_Cowards", "http://www.goodreads.com/book/show/3616100-shane-and-other-stories"]}
