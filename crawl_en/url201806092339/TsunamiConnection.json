Beginning with a cover operation in Egypt gone wrong the story moves on to the repercussions of said mission and introduces details about the personal lives of agents Kafira and Zac and their step parents and mentors. The backgrounds are fascinating and add welcome complications and twists to the story.

The novel features a young woman named Kefira, a highly-skilled Mossad agent, trained since childhood in the art of espionage (The agency took her in after her parents perished in a bomb blast at the Israeli embassy in Argentina). The novel opens with Kefira losing fourteen commandos under her command to a rocket propelled grenade in an Egyptian desert. Before the perpetrator died, Kefira is able to extract the name of the attack's mastermind: MacAuley.Back in the Mossad headquarters, Kefira is given a mission by her controller (who happens to be her stepmother) to capture MacAuley and extract whatever information she can get from him before terminating him. The mission leads Kefira and her elite team of operatives from Tel Aviv to Scotland. When their contact in Edinburgh winds up dead in a bathtub with his kneecaps shot out, the M.O. tells them of a Fenian involvement, which leads them to an Irish bar in Boston, Massachusetts. Critical lead surfaces and the novel takes Kefira's team to San Francisco and other interesting foreign locales with the conspiracy getting bigger and much more complicated as they peel off the layers. To make matters worse, a fresh lead now implicates Kefira's stepmother Yochana, a Mossad adviser to the prime minister and the woman who mothered Kefira since childhood.Tsunami Connection is a multi-pronged novel with subplots interwoven seamlessly together. There is a cause and effect in its trajectory where one discovery leads to another. This is the strength of the novel and I applaud the author for weaving such a complex yet tight and believable story. I love how the plot took me to foreign locales that allowed me \"see\" these places. And as each plot layer is revealed and more clues are uncovered, the narrative becomes fast-paced. Where the novel falters is in its narrative style which is confusing and hard to follow. Sometimes, the scenes are not described well, making it difficult to get grounded into the story. The dialogue seems wooden at times and a bit confusing. Jumping back and forth in the timeline to reveal important plot points/back story didn't help. I kept having to flip back to sections I already read. It's a shame because the plot is outstanding and the main characters such as Kefira and Zak, and even secondary ones like the Coptic Christian double agent, Shafiq are intriguing. This could have been a really good book, comparable to Daniel Silva's Gabriel Allon novels, which are all bestsellers. Did I enjoy it? I guess. I'm a sucker for thrillers and the plot and pacing still had me turning the pages. With more work on the dialogue and polishing of the prose, this can be a really good book. I'd say, three stars, maybe 3.5."}, {"userName": "Lisa Reads & Reviews", "userReviewDate": "Jan 26, 2015", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/5395843-lisa-reads-reviews", "userReview": "Gallagher's debut novel is very ambitious and must have required a lot of thought, planning, and research. I'm not a proper judge of political, espionage thrillers as I don't read them often enough to comment on this novel in context of genre, but the action and plot rolled the story forward at a lively pace. I was reminded of the TV series, Alias, as the woman protagonist, Kefira, is kick-butt competent, was groomed to be a tool for clandestine government activities since childhood, yet remains feminine and emotionally vulnerable. The scenes in the novel are more sexually explicit and brutal than Alias, the TV show, but the plots are similarly intricate. In contrast to Alias, Tsunami Connection involves existing national organizations and current political topics. I believe this is the first of a series. If so, the bar is set high for each installment to continue to flesh out characters and stretch the reader's imagination with sparkling prose and mind boggling plots."}, {"userName": "Christina OW", "userReviewDate": "Feb 15, 2013", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/8590794-christina-ow", "userReview": "Tsunami Connection is the first novel of trilogy by Michael James Gallagher and it is worth the cost- well, I got it for free but it is still a great book and I can\u2019t wait to read the other two books.It is a fast paced thriller about terrorists, set in the Middle East, Russia and North Korea. It shows that the author did extensive research because he gave knowledgeable details and made it quite easy for the reader to picture it, even the characters.What I liked most about it, is that it wasn\u2019t predictable and the story was something that actually happens in the contemporary world."}, {"userName": "Patricia Hamill", "userReviewDate": "Apr 03, 2013", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/12951093-patricia-hamill", "userReview": "Tsunami Connection is an action packed, political thriller.Kefira, a sleeper agent in Mossad, loses half of her team when an RPG hits their helicopter and explodes into a fiery mess. Determined to find those responsible for the bomber, she tracks down the likely suspects with the assistance of a charismatic team of agents. But, what she learns may be more than she can handle.What I like most about this book are the richly described locations. The author has obviously drawn from extensive research and possibly personal experience to bring them to life. The people, the culture, the details, all work perfectly. The locations I enjoy from the book the most are Canada, Argentina, and Egypt. I learned a lot from this book: terminology, exotic animals, and cultural information. The author defined some of them in the narration, sometimes a few times, but others I had to Google (a lot). Perhaps I'm just not all that well traveled, but in the first several chapters I had to Google every few pages to look up terms like \"Weaver Stance,\" which was used to describe how a character was holding a gun. Having to drop out of the book to figure out what the author was talking about, distracted for the story at times, which is probably one of the reasons it seemed choppy and hard to follow in places.The temporal jumps also distracted from the story at times. Sometimes you would flash back to Kefira or Zak's youth or childhood; sometimes, you'd flash back a year, a week, etc. True, the author indicates the date for each chapter as part of the chapter heading, but as I typically disregard chapter headings I'd usually get a few pages in before realizing something was up. Then, I'd have to flip back to see what I missed. It got easier near the end of the story because I learned to pay attention to the cues. The story features several erotic scenes, most of which are way more mechanically detailed than I feel they need to be. I prefer romantic scenes to be just that, romantic. These weren't. It was all about what was going on, very little emotion or feeling. However, that isn't to say there isn't romance. I love the interactions between Kefira and the older Argentinian dancer, very sexy and heartfelt even though the two don't actually get together. I also felt a deep connection between Kefira and Michael. Strangely, the romance between Kefira and Zak felt flat to me. I just didn't emotionally connect with the two of them as a couple, though I liked each as an individual.As for the link to the title, Tsunami Connection, there is mention of a submarine with the capability to produce tsunami's, but I felt the story failed to make a connection between Kefira's activities and the rogue submarine. I believe, and this is a pure guess, that this first book introduces the idea of the submarine, but focuses mostly on background and character development. I expect the next installment in the series to focus on the submarine and stopping it from wreaking havoc in the world. Overall, Tsunami Connection is a meticulously researched political thriller. People who enjoy exotic locations, spy thrillers, or political intrigue might also enjoy this book.

The book starts with a dangerous and deadly military operation in the Sinai Desert. Kefira is in the center of the action and comes across as rational, logical, and highly trained. Kefira\u2019s strong intuition, probably also a result of her training and experience, helps her make the right decisions in very difficult circumstances. A few chapters later, the author takes us back in time to a younger Kefira. The scene in her high school headmaster\u2019s office is tense, emotional, and provides the readers with an understanding of traumatic events that brought Kefira to her life in the Mossad and hints at the reasons for the strength of her character. One of the aspects of this book that I especially enjoyed is the change of pace that kept me involved in this story from start to finish. The narrative varied from tension-filled action scenes to quieter, slower (but still tense) scenes that allowed for a more in-depth character development. One of my favorite scenes is Kefira\u2019s interaction with Fripo, an older man she meets in Buenos Aires. Their interaction is not only important to the plot, but it also gives the readers an opportunity to see a different side of Kefira: she puts her guard down and shares her feelings on a traumatic event in her childhood that has shaped her life. That interaction is one of the many scenes that make Kefira a much more realistic character, a person to relate to and root for.

Thank you Mr. Gallagher!I think some other reviewers have mentioned this too, but I absolutely adored the various locations that the author takes the reader to in this story. I am an avid traveler and I've always had a fascination with Russia ever since I started studying the language several years ago. I thought the scenes set in Russia were done very convincingly (I wouldn't know about North Korea and the Middle East, as I've never been there myself, but that was vividly described as well!) and the story was fast-paced and featured some interesting characters. I usually don't really read spy novels, so I can't boast great knowledge about other books in this genre, but it was definitely interesting. It felt very realistic. I did feel that the sentence structure was a bit stilted here and there (I think it was a punctuation issue) so that could have been edited a little bit better. I'd also recommend getting a more appealing cover, because I wouldn't pick out this book in an Amazon 'line-up', so to speak - this book deserves a cool spy & terrorist cover that conveys the message better!Overall, I would recommend this book to fans of action-packed spy novels, so if that's you, don't pass this one up!"}, {"userName": "Duane Gundrum", "userReviewDate": "Apr 03, 2013", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/4721707-duane-gundrum", "userReview": "This is one of those books that introduces someone to a writer who is probably going to go far in his career (as a writer). The story was solid, the characters believable, and the locations well done. It felt a lot like an earlier James Bond story, if the hero was female, Israeli and had actual feelings.The only thing that held me back during the reading was the dialogue. Mostly, it was done well, but there were times where I found myself wondering if people would actually speak that way. The trick to dialogue is to write as people talk, not just to get the grammar and English right. There were a few times where the back and forth of the dialogue caused me to stop and think, would people in this relationship actually talk like this on a constant basis, and there were a couple of times where I had to say no. If this was fixed, there's no reason in the world I wouldn't give this book 5 stars.But I don't want to detract from the story itself, which I found to be well worth reading.

This book is essentially an action-packed spy novel mostly centered around a Mossad agent named Kefira. I commend the author for weaving so many very recent current events like the coup in Egypt and the civil war in Syria into the narrative. However, being as I\u2019m part Egyptian, I spent the early chapters of the book too emotionally worked up about the references to the Israeli \u2013 Palestinian conflict and the overthrow of the Egyptian government to really get into the story. However, I don\u2019t think the author intended to take a political stance one way or the other, and when I spoke to the author I was reassured that he had already intended to bring in a character to represent the Palestinian perspective into the next book of the series. Fortunately, this book was not about Israel and Palestine or anything like that and the book quickly moved us from country to country and allowed us to visit with people from a multitude of cultures: Indonesia, Argentina, Israel, Egypt, and Russia just to name a few. This must have taken a huge amount of research to accomplish (and possibly even experiences from personal travels). The research was very evident and the author did put a lot of effort into capturing the different traits and habits of various cultures. As someone who really knows Egypt, there were a couple very minor details that struck me as imperfect, but they were so minor even a foreigner visiting Egypt would not notice the discrepancies between the book\u2019s descriptions and reality. I did enjoy the second half of the book better than the first as that\u2019s when the action picked up (and when I\u2019d gotten somewhat over my initial response to the early references to politics). Kefira seemed to bounce from one Romance to the next at first, but she settled down into one relationship by the end which I appreciated. I also liked that the book was being led by a strong woman. I do wish that she was portrayed to be just a touch more competent though. It seemed at times that she was driven more by \u2018instinct\u2019 then by skill and she let her emotions get the better of her training more than once in the book. With that said, she was portrayed as being a good agent and I did come to like Kefira. I also liked the mentions of futuristic technology and the use of spy tech throughout. A lot of this technology will probably become reality in the near future (cloaking devices for example) and some of it, such as shape charges, is already a reality (although as far as I know, shape charges are not currently used in the way that the book suggested they could be). I personally would not read the next book in the series as I don\u2019t care to get myself worked up over Middle East politics and cultural stereotypes again, but I imagine that someone who enjoys spy novels and books that take place on a global setting would find this an enjoyable read. Potential readers should note that there are a few adult sexual scenes as well as a bit of violence in places. I am grateful to the author for providing me with a free copy of \u2018Tsunami Connection\u2019 in exchange for my honest review."}, {"userName": "Gerald Greene", "userReviewDate": "Jan 06, 2014", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/10363460-gerald-greene", "userReview": "Master Wordsmith Constructs Remarkable Vivid DescriptionsTsunami Connection by Michael James GallagherGallagher is a master wordsmith. The story of Mossad operatives Kafira, Zak, Yochana, Sam and others is complicated as most spy tales are. I found I was as interested in the rich detailed descriptions of places,peoples,and objects as the story line.In the middle of the novel Kafira, a beauty trained by Mossad from an early age, makes a trip to Buenos Aires. Descriptions of the city and Kafira in a Tango club are remarkable and show the writer's highly developed descriptive skill set. As the scenes unfold you can almost hear Tango music playing and feel the dancers passion. The current edited and reformatted version removes explicit sex scenes. Those who like hints of sexual encounters will not be disappointed.Vivid descriptions remain throughout the novel.The editing makes the novel more suitable for those more interested in an exciting well written spy story rather than erotic content. Gallagher shows a deep understanding of Mid-eastern, Irish, Mediterranean, and Argentine life and customs as the story progresses and discloses his knowledge throughout the novel.In the original version as seen with a Paperwhite Kindle the formatting could be improved. Some paragraphs are quite long and to me detracted from the story line. To my eyes more frequent paragraph breaks would make the flow easier to follow.

After finishing it, I think I\u2019ll be picking up a few more along those lines.This book has many strong points working in its favor: it\u2019s imaginative and action-packed, and the plot has a number of twists and turns I never saw coming (This part is very important to me - if I see it coming I simply put down the book and leave it there).The description of the many locations is also a major thumbs up. I unfortunately have never had the privilege of traveling to these places, but I suspect the author has. Moreover, he has skillfully captured the local scenery and customs of each of these and put them on paper. This is one repertoire I believe many authors lack.For these reason I actually give it 4.5 stars!Why don\u2019t I give it five stars?I have only one reason: the dialogue between characters lags a little behind the book\u2019s other strengths, and this is too important an issue to set aside. Dialogue matters! It gives insight into each character and is worth ten times its weight in narrative description in fleshing them out.The important elements are there. There\u2019s a story to be told, and an engaging one at that, and this is what matters the most.

This 'Black Ops' tale has a spontaneity and sense of realism that makes for a very interesting read. The world of spies and covert operators operations is a dark and often sinister one, where friendships are defined in terms of human assets and liabilities, and fixed relationships are elusive. Characters are not empathic or romanticized, just plain dangerous people in a very dangerous world. M.J. Gallagher captures this feeling with admirable deftness. You find yourself asking: \"Did this really happen?\" and \"Who is this guy?\". The answer to the latter is a talented, insightful author who knows his stuff and did his homework. I would not be a bit surprised if Gallagher becomes one of those authors whose name is synonymous with taught espionage stories and hard hitting plots.

The plot wove back and forth in time, giving us glimpses of Kefira's history without info dumping it all at one time as some authors are prone to doing. There were plenty of twists and turns to keep me interested in what would happen next, but the best part was how emotionally invested I became in the outcome for Kefira.

The character development is lacking and confusing. I found that, even by the end of the book, I was not invested in any of them. The plot was difficult to follow and there are numerous spots where the explanation for an event or the appearance of necessary equipment seemed to be added in as an afterthought.There are paragraphs that are numerous pages long and places where following the dialogue was trying. Movement of the plot was interrupted more than once by the inclusion such things as the history and evolution of the Tango--while interesting, it stopped the flow of the story.The ideas are good, the imagination rampant and the willingness to put words on the page are present, but regrettably the book doesn\u2019t reach its potential. It could use a serious structural editing, followed by a strong copy-editing and proofreading.

Cool!Some things are done very well and some others were not to my liking and these are sometimes right next to each other which makes the difference all the more evident. For example the author\u2019s description of the events surrounding one agent\u2019s escape from Egypt during the Tahir Square uprising was exciting and compelling yet immediately after that the book falls into a section which feels very tired in the way that it merely explains what happens (instead of showing). Another reviewer had commented that the writing style feels journalistic and this is exactly what I saw. It sometimes felt like I was reading a newspaper recounting of events. If the author could have stuck with the former style for the entire book then I think this could have easily been a 5 star rating from me. Perhaps the author\u2019s strongest suite lies in the way he can describe locations, specific mannerisms, items, cars and places that would be specific to those locations. This felt very real and very authentic to me. I do not know if the author has been to all these different places as there are so many but if not he has done his research well. Perhaps his weakest suite, to me, is in his dialog. Many conversations throughout the book felt contrived or jumpy, not fully fleshed out or inauthentic. Maybe I don\u2019t know how spys speak but many of the conversations just didn\u2019t feel \u2018right\u2019 to me. There are an abundance of small errors, such as spelling or grammatical that could use a good scrubbing (even stuff like a comma in the middle of a word \u2013clearly a mistyping or \u201cmassage\u201d being spelled \u201cmessage\u201d, etc., etc., etc.). Also other mix ups are present such as in chapter 12 where the author describe something Sarah and Aden is doing but calls them Aden and Zak which make things very confusing. Normally I overlook spelling and grammatical errors with independent authors because they are on their own and don\u2019t have an army of editors helping them but this book had so many that it was really starting to become a distraction. It almost felt like it was a first draft.On a final note, this book is not for children as it has some depictions of sexual acts that are a bit graphic (unnecessarily in my opinion) and it is a spy novel so obviously there is some violence also."}, {"userName": "Andrew Morgan", "userReviewDate": "May 01, 2013", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/17136852-andrew-morgan", "userReview": "I was gifted Tsunami Connection for a non-reciprocal review.The Positives:Tsunami Connection is a multi-layered, three-dimensional work that has clearly been well-researched, thoroughly planned and executed with precision. I have had the fortune of visiting some of the exotic locations mentioned in the book, and the details are spot on. Detail extends beyond the geographical; any and every subject matter that features in Tsunami Connection is thoroughly and convincingly researched.The plot follows a fairly conventional political thriller theme, yet the twists and turns are unpredictable and the pace bounces along at a comfortable rate, introducing characters, relationships and events with good rhythm. The depth of the plot adds a reassuringly richness to the book, giving the reader confidence that it won't unravel in a disappointing manner - which it doesn't.The Negatives:I found the style of writing difficult to get along with, which is a shame, because the rest of the book was so complete. Description, although detailed and well-informed, came across in an almost journalistic way, laying out the picture with a matter-of-fact starkness that wasn't to my taste. This isn't to say that my feelings are to be mirrored by everyone - this is purely preference.The writing style extended to dialogue, which had a very unnatural, stilted quality to it that was almost robotic, lacking in a certain humanity that makes people feel like people. As an extension of the characters, I also felt that the sex scenes seemed out of place within the book. It's not to do with prudishness on my part - sex has its place - but the graphical nature of the scenes stuck out as feeling like a different book entirely. By way of analogy, imagine a graphically hardcore scene in the middle of any of the Bourne films - it would dismember the plot.The Summary:There is a lot to like here. I personally didn't get on with the prose itself, but I understand the author is having the book edited. Perhaps after the editing, the plot, depth and detail will get that final coat of polish it deserves."}, {"userName": "Joanie Pariera", "userReviewDate": "Jul 02, 2013", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/16914529-joanie-pariera", "userReview": "\"Tsunami Connection\" is a political thriller with an elaborate international setting. A young woman who is a Mossad agent, and a host of other double agents and such weave in and out of several countries, chasing an adversary or avoiding one, as the case may be. It was hard for me to get into at first, but eventually I really wanted to know if Kefira would make it out okay. I sort of expected Yoshana\u2019s (Kefira\u2019s stepmother) back story to be explained a bit more, especially in light of the events towards the end-but I guess the focus stayed with Kefira. The two Michaels were really interesting as were the surprisingly detailed accounts of weapons smuggling and suicide bombers. I haven\u2019t read such details anywhere else and I honestly don\u2019t know if it\u2019s actually true or if the author makes it really believable. Most spy novels build their plots around the chases but this one focuses more on the techniques. The other element in this story is the one about \u2018cultivating\u2019 agents. Both the male and female agents seemed to be living out the ambitions of their respective guardians. That angle could have been explored a bit more. I was given a free copy to review and I cant help but mention that as with so many other indie writers the writing, while being clearly noticeable, stumbles into \u2018error zones\u2019 every now and then. How is it possible for a writer to spew out page after page and yet badly mangle sentences here and there? Something to think about?"}, {"userName": "Uvi Poznansky", "userReviewDate": "Mar 18, 2015", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/7715377-uvi-poznansky", "userReview": "Tsunami Connection (the first in the New World Trilogy) is a fast-paced, intriguing spy thriller, with scenes set in the Middle east (such as the Sinai desert), North Korea and Russia. Written in snappy chapters, and alternating between fast paced action and a reflective tone that facilitates character development, the book is well balanced. It features Kefira (whose name in Hebrew means lioness): a fierce, courageous, and highly trained Mossad operative. You will be gripped by the dangers she faces on her mission and relieved by the narrow escapes. The scenes are lovingly painted, with a light touch that leads you directly back into the action: \u201cAt midnight, an ocean breeze straggled across the rooftops to the crown of a luxury duplex on Melchette Street, Tel Aviv.\u201d The flashbacks to Kefira\u2019s past illuminate the traumatic events that shaped her past and forged her mettle. \u201cOrphaned at a young age, Kefira involuntarily became an instrument, Mossad\u2019s contrivance.\u201d Some of the reviewers commented on the ending being a cliff hanger, but I fully understand the need for it, as it is designated to be a jumping board to the next adventure in the series.Five stars."}, {"userName": "J.M.

The characters are interesting and varied in the setting of spy plots and Special Forces operations carried out by an ultra-secret arm of the Mossad. Action is fast-paced, the narrative informative without being intrusive, and the author's staggering amount of research into his subject shines through on every page. Having done similar research myself I know how much time and effort it takes and is very commendable that the author has created such realism in which to place his characters. I enjoyed reading this book and have no hesitation in giving it five stars and recommending it to other readers who are looking for political/spy/military thriller intrigue. The story keeps the reader gripped from the first page as we follow the exploits of Kefira, Zak, their handlers Yochana and Sam, and the Machiavellian opposition. Several surprises lie in store and what the reader expects is not what happens. Well-crafted plotlines raise this book to the top of its genre."}, {"userName": "Blueflame", "userReviewDate": "May 11, 2014", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/31309240-blueflame", "userReview": "An Interesting readIt's a wonderful story, there's no doubt about it.
