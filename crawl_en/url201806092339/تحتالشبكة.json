Both are seriously separated from normality, and both take us on their disjointed, almost chaotic, trips around their respective cities; Jake in London and Holden in New York. Salinger's novel was published in 1951, Murdoch's in 1954, but I don't think there was any influence there, at least consciously, but their similarities struck me. But now over 60 years later, Holden Caulfield is certainly more famous than Jake Donaghue. Nevertheless, both novels are well entrenched in 20th century literary history, both appearing in Time Magazine's and Modern Library's best 100 novels list."}, {"userName": "Trevor", "userReviewDate": "Dec 08, 2007", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/175635-trevor", "userReview": "I loved this book. A first person narrative about a young man on a picaresque quest for love and friendship, with a good healthy dose of philosophy added in for good measure.The part of the story that stays with me is the story around Hugo. I think I liked most the idea that a friendship might end on the basis of an assumed betrayal and that the betrayal is one of the spirit and not one that occurred at all. Although, that is an interesting question in itself - does the person we feel we have betrayed have to feel betrayed to have been betrayed?This is the only of Murdoch's books I've ever read, but will read more now after this."}, {"userName": "Fabian", "userReviewDate": "Jan 03, 2012", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/1036893-fabian", "userReview": "The cocky narrator of \"Under the Net\" is precisely what all true antiheroes are made of. Roaming the streets of London like a vagabond (though money frequently touches his hands) & interacting with vile people, THIS is a perpetual ode to laziness, exactly the type of thing to spark my particular interest. The story is organic, its flow envious: few writers can get away with such subtle themes and sensual undertow. It is eerie, weirdly and mysteriously symbolic. A more faithful rendition of London life had not crossed my eyes ever since \"Mrs. Dalloway.\" This novel is a true treasure, it's as delicious as revenge, as emblematic as Big Ben, and as readable & elegant a read as few books EVER are."}, {"userName": "Rebecca Foster", "userReviewDate": "Nov 23, 2017", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/5875398-rebecca-foster", "userReview": "(3.5) I plan to dip in and out of Liz Dexter\u2019s two-year Iris Murdoch readalong project to increase my familiarity with Murdoch and get through some of the paperbacks I happen to own. Even though I don\u2019t own it, I decided to join in with Under the Net (1954) to see how her fiction career began.Under the Net is narrated by Jake Donoghue, a translator who arrives back in London after a trip to France to find that he\u2019s being kicked out of the flat where he\u2019s been living for free with his friend Finn. In his desultory search for where to go next he takes readers along to Mrs Tinckham\u2019s cat-filled shop, his Jewish philosopher friend Dave\u2019s place, and the theatre where a former girlfriend, Anna Quentin, is in charge of props. (One of my favorite scenes has him accidentally locked into the theatre overnight; he has to sleep among the costumes.)Anna\u2019s sister Sadie, an actress, offers Jake a role as her bodyguard; she has a stalker of sorts, fireworks manufacturer and film studio owner Hugo Belfounder \u2013 whom, it turns out, Jake already knows. Together they were guinea pigs for an experiment on the common cold, and Jake secretly worked up Hugo\u2019s conversations into a poorly received book called The Silencer. \u201cHugo was my destiny,\u201d Jake muses; even though he\u2019s embarrassed to see Hugo again, he gets drawn back into a connection with him.One of the central themes of the novel, playing out with various characters, is the difficulty of seeing people clearly rather than resting with the image of them you\u2019ve built up in your mind. I enjoyed Jake\u2019s contrasting of physical and intellectual work, and his (sometimes contradictory) reflections on solitude and introversion:I sometimes feel that Finn has very little inner life. I mean no disrespect to him in saying this; some have and some haven\u2019t. I connect this too with his truthfulness. Subtle people, like myself, can see too much ever to give a straight answer.I hate solitude, but I am afraid of intimacy. The substance of my life is a private conversation with myself which to turn into a dialogue would be equivalent to self-destruction. The company which I need is the company which a pub or a caf\u00e9 will provide.If like myself you are a connoisseur of solitude, I recommend to you the experience of being alone in Paris on the fourteenth of July.Many readers probably expect Murdoch\u2019s books to be dense and difficult, bogged down with philosophical ideas. But what I most noticed about this first novel is how humorous it is: it\u2019s even madcap in places, with some coming and going via windows and Mister Mars, the film star dog, playing dead to get Jake out of a sticky situation. Over at Liz\u2019s blog we\u2019ve been discussing whether Murdoch is a typical \u2018woman writer\u2019; if her books had been published anonymously or under her initials, would it have been assumed that she was a man? I think so, given her success in creating a male narrator and her focus on the world of work and less traditional domestic arrangements.This is my sixth Murdoch book. I didn\u2019t enjoy Under the Net as much as the Booker Prize-winning The Sea, The Sea or The Bell, but liked it more than The Black Prince and An Unofficial Rose (I\u2019ve also read one of her philosophy books, The Fire and the Sun; I could make neither head nor tail of it), so it falls right in the middle for me so far. I\u2019m looking forward to participating with several more of the readalong books next year, starting with A Severed Head in March.Another favorite line, spoken by Hugo: \u201cOne must just blunder on.

It's better to just buckle in with her. Her characters are basically insane, and so are her plots, and so are her sentences. They have a tidal effect; they pull you under. Under the Net reminds me of Martin Amis's Money, or more accurately Money reminds me of it. They feature amoral protagonists in the entertainment industry, and they're both nuts. I actually think Money is a little better. It's certainly amped up, which is startling considering how far Murdoch is already amped past mostly everyone else.She published this, her first novel, in 1954, so just before the similarly unhinged On the Road blew up the Beats. She was Irish, and you know how Irish novelists are. (Recent discussion: \"Has there ever been a sane Irish author?\") So far as the plot matters, it follows Jake Donaghue through a series of misadventures. He kidnaps a dog. He schemes to get money, while steadfastly turning down every opportunity to have it. He gets drunk. He discusses philosophy and socialism. The most memorable character is the dog.Murdoch is not my favorite author. I like her but I'm not burning to read every one of her books. I'm going to read some of them, though! They strain at the seams. She's thoroughly off on her own trip and you're not invited to participate; you may watch. She's distinct, thus the like. Some books are like marathons and some like sprints, and hers are like meandering chases through side streets, after which you are out of breath and sweaty and you've pulled a hamstring and you're not sure if you lost the guy chasing you or not."}, {"userName": "Bettie\u262f", "userReviewDate": "Sep 07, 2015", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/1108123-bettie", "userReview": "Description:  Iris Murdoch's first novel is set in a part of London where struggling writers rub shoulders with successful bookies, and film starlets with frantic philosophers. Its hero, Jake Donaghue, is a drifting, clever, likeable young man who makes a living out of translation work and sponging on his friends. A meeting with Anna, an old flame, leads him into a series of fantastic adventures. Jake is captivated by a majestic philosopher, Hugo Belfounder, whose profound and inconclusive reflections give the book its title - under the net of language. Opening: When I saw Finn waiting for me at the corner of the street I knew at once that something had gone wrong.This is me trying to read all of Murdoch's oeuvre and will admit to being grateful that didn't have the bad luck to have encountered this one first. My mid-teen initiation to Murdoch in the newly sprung 70s was 'The Severed Head.''Under the Net' does have some adorable moments to treasure, not least with Mister Mars, but the philosophical aspects were very heavy-handed, and dare I use the word pompous. The title could just have easily been 'Between the Lines' or 'Behind the Mask', nothing very deep after all.

The substance of my life is a private conversation with myself which to turn into a dialogue would be equivalent to self-destruction\"Winner of the Booker Prize, Irish-born British author Iris Murdoch\u2019s (1919-1999) 1954 novel 'Under the Net' is a philosophical fiction dealing with the exuberant spirit of existentialism and freedom in a postwar europe. 'Under the Net' is Murdoch\u2019s very first novel, and remains one of her most popular. In 2005, it was nominated by the TIME magazine as one of the greatest English-language novels from 1923 to present.'Under the Net' is an intimate journey, a retrospective look at life through the eyes of Jake Donaghue, the protagonist and the novel\u2019s swashbuckling first-person narrator. Jake is a impoverished, rootless, aspiring young writer who also translates French novels into English for a living. The novel depicts Jack\u2019s picaresque quest for love and friendship. Jake has no commitment, no jobs and his relationships are purely for sex & shelter.At the beginning of the novel Jack and his friend Finn are thrown out of the flat they have been living rent-free for last 18 months. The owner of the flat is their female friend Madge, who is concerned that her new lover, a rich bookmaker Sammy Starfieldby, may not like her sheltering two bohemian male friends. Jake seeks refuge among his other friends - Anna Quentin, Jake\u2019s ex-love, Hugo Belfounder, Anna\u2019s current admirer and particularly Dave Gellman, a professional philosopher who is heavily influenced by the Austrian-British philosopher Ludwig Wittgenstein, and who leads the philosophical discourse, the exchange of ideas and words in this novel.Jake\u2019s life goes through a series of chance, chaos, misfortune and hilarious misunderstandings, all of which conspire to transform his perception of life. When the French novelist Jean-Pierre Breteuil, whose rather mediocre novels Jack has been translating for a living, unexpectedly wins the prestigious Prix Goncourt award - Jake realises that his perception needs to change. During the course of moving from one place to another, particularly the journey between London and Paris, Jake takes a hard look at his own life, - his past, present and future, renegotiates his love life, - all from a philosophical point of view. At the end Jake realises that his literary career has only began. He is finally ready to see the world.The novel is an easy read, fast moving, cleverly written and subtly funny; the characters are well developed, interesting and distinct. Murdoch\u2019s tactic of using first person narrative makes the novel very approachable and engaging, readers will immediately get into the story and become a part of their favourite characters.Beneath the surface of Jake\u2019s narrative, lies a number of philosophical questions. It shows how we are trapped in a net of language, prisons created by none but us, where emotions and sentiments are inexpressible through the limited power of words, yet this exchange of ideas and dialogues is the only hope to escape from this prison. Murdoch paints this struggle and contradiction vividly, and shows our inability to describe our very personal feelings in words. She rigorously explores the nature of art and how far it distances us from reality, and concludes that art and morality are one. Under the Net teaches us to appreciate the philosophical silence in the backdrop of a self-centred, chaotic, superficial city life and leads us to a greater understanding of friendship, love, art, creativity and nature of truth.Murdoch, Iris.

We need to have a basis for our criticism, a chunk of spoken reason, or thought, behind our critiques and accolades of each book we read. Otherwise we\u2019ll end up looking like the foolish critic in Norman Rockwell\u2019s painting, sucking on a strand of hay while we squint and furrow at a work of art still in progress.By the time Murdoch\u2019s book was assigned that quarter, I was trying hard not be caught with straw between my teeth as I read about a struggling writer. Iris was female. (She passed away only a few years before I read this first published novel of hers.) Her gender didn\u2019t keep her from writing from a man\u2019s perspective.The author created a sparkling account of Jake Donaghue, the penniless artist who networks with an array of magnetic characters throughout London and Paris. Drifting through these quintessential corners of the world, Jake flirts with starlets, crosses bookies and brainstorms about life with the eccentric. Rekindled love and episodes of the absurd burn and douse the pages; smoldering gems of satire and panache (too much?) reveal themselves en route to Jake's final philosophy on life. From page one, witty phrases made me smile--and this marvelous little world that was constructed never ebbs far from the insightful.Virginia Woolf called novels \u201clife escapes.\u201d She continued, \u201cand perhaps without life nothing else is worth while.\u201d If we didn\u2019t have existence in all its zaniness--all its pitch changes and scars\u2014where would books take us? There would be nothing left to write about and no reason to read. Many people question writers, wondering how someone can have so much to say when most are running on fumes by the end of page one. But there\u2019s no EMPTY line for the imagination coupled with experience. Ms. Murdoch proves there\u2019s always something worth writing about. And always something worth experiencing, read or lived."}, {"userName": "Daniel", "userReviewDate": "Aug 22, 2007", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/300957-daniel", "userReview": "It seems to me that most male authors have male central characters, and female authors female central characters, especially when the novel is in the first person. It also seems to me that female authors (in general) create more believable female central characters, and male authors (in general) more believable male characters, especially concerning central characters and particularly when in the first person narrative. This shouldn't be surprising. That said, this novel, for me, is the best exception to this putative rule. There are acute problems that I had with the ideas/motivations of the central male character, but aside from them Murdoch does a *wonderful* job of crafting a believable, fascinating male central character. Oh, and the novel is very good, too."}, {"userName": "Deea", "userReviewDate": "Sep 21, 2013", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/8111258-deea", "userReview": "Iris Murdoch is among my favorite writers. I\u2019ve read 4 books by her so far (this is the 4th) and I was amazed with her capacity to touch psychology and philosophy at the same time, while focusing on crucial moments from the lives of her characters. I read \u201cThe Sea, The Sea\u201d (her Man Booker Prize work) and I considered it stunning, but the other books I read by her were even more powerful than her award-winning novel.\u201cStarting a novel is opening a door on a misty landscape; you can still see very little but you can smell the earth and feel the wind blowing.\u201d, says Murdoch. This is how this novel started: promising at the beginning, it seemed to raise a lot of psychological questions. Its intricate plot seemed promising at the beginning as well. Through the book, I felt the author was rather drifting than continuing with the problems introduced upon the reader at first. This might have been only a strategy and having read Murdoch before, I was actually expecting this, but in the end, the problems were still there, alive and untouched. Maybe this was the whole idea: just to put some philosophical ideas out in the open and not really debate on them, but rather to stir the mind of the reader and determine him to ponder upon them. Although I like subtlety, whatever the intention of the writer in this book, the approach was a bit too subtle for me to appreciate it at its fullest.Jake Donaghue, a rather bohemian writer who once wrote a book, but is now only doing translation work is kicked out of his accommodation and has to look for a solution. He contacts a friend (Dave) for help and he suggests Jake should contact Anna, a woman he had loved years ago. He meets her and a chain of events is determined. Jake gets to find out that everything around him is somehow connected: Anna is in love with a person whom he had considered his best friend, while this friend is in love with Anna\u2019s sister. He had stopped talking to this friend long ago because the only book he published was a modified version of their discussions and he thought his friend (Hugo) would be offended.As Murdoch says so poetically, \u201cwe all live in the interstices of each other\u2019s lives, and we could all get a surprise if we could see everything\u201d. Jake Donaghue gets to know a bit of this \"everything\" and he realizes that all his perceptions had been totally wrong. As I have read in one of the reviews from Goodreads, I do think too that \u201cUnder the Net\u201d is a book about language and its inability to express certain things and it stresses on the fact that life itself is an amalgamation of meaningless events to which the individual gives meaning. Jack\u2019s life goes through a series of misunderstandings and all this mixture of chance and chaos conspires to transform his perception of life: his past, present and future rewrite themselves and renegotiate his true feelings towards Anna, Hugo and his writing career. His revelations through the book are described very poetically by Murdoch in the next fragments:\u201cWhat then took place within my mind was much the same as happens in a huge theater if the lights suddenly go out, and someone shrilly screams in the swift-winged darkness, and other voices join in, resulting in a blind tempest, with the black thunder of panic growing-until suddenly the lights come on again, and the performance of the play is blandly resumed.\u201dand\u201cEvents stream past us like these crowds and the face of each is seen only for a minute. What is urgent is not urgent for ever but only ephemerally. All work and all love, the search for wealth and fame, the search for truth, like itself, are made up of moments which pass and become nothing. Yet through this shaft of nothings we drive onward with that miraculous vitality that creates our precarious habitations in the past and the future. So we live: a spirit that broods and hovers over the continual death of time, the lost meaning, the unrecaptured moment, the unremembered face, until the final chop that ends all our moments and plunges that spirit back into the void from which it came.\u201dNow that I come to think of it while writing this review, Murdoch\u2019s book is not bad at all: it\u2019s actually really good, but it just needs a lot more pondering than the others maybe in order to decipher its meanings. She highlights with subtlety that language is a barrier and we are trapped under the net of language: it can create emotional prisons and our feelings become sometimes impossible to express because the power of words is limited. My first reaction was to declare myself disappointed. After reanalyzing my thoughts about this book, I can say that Murdoch has managed to impress me once again with her ability of putting out there very deep psychological problems. I somehow feel like her character Jake Donaghue: I feel that I had a misperception when I finished the book and after a time of pondering, I come to realize through analysis the depth of what I read.Way to go Murdoch. You\u2019re still among my favorite authors!

Much to my great delight, it was no such thing.This book has a likeable, somewhat puckish, picaresque protagonist who leads you through a few days of his life in a conversational, easy-to-read style. We see the carousel of his relationships as the people in his life dance around him, we witness his philosophy of life as it evolves and grows and we share in some rather amusing hi-jinx involving a canine movie star.While it didn't exactly blow me away or move me deeply I can honestly say Under The Net was a joy to read.

The First Person POV misanthropic antihero reminded somewhat of Salinger; the highly detailed descriptions reminded me somewhat of A. S. Byatt, and the semantics/linguistics philosophy reminded me strongly of Alfred Korzybski and S. I. Hayakawa. I admire all of these other writers and thinkers, so I'm surprised I didn't like it more than I did. Maybe the wandering nature of the plot left me wanting more narrative pull? Whatever, I\u2019d like to try another one of her novels in the future.

What an odd book. At first, I took it seriously - that is, until I realized that it was meant to be funny. Parts of it were totally absurd and reminded me of that crazy movie that the Beatles put out in 1964 (A Hard Day's Night), which was a madcap romp around London. No particular destination, just following whims and the needs of the moment. Running from people; racing around trying to find other people. It was funny for a while but then it became confusing. On the other hand, parts of this book were extremely philosophical, almost wise! I haven't thought about it enough to figure out exactly what Murdoch was trying to say (if anything) but I read a nice review on GR which seemed to sum it up quite nicely. The review is here.I think that I need to ponder the book some more. There is a lot in it - it's just hard to see how it all connects."}, {"userName": "Angie", "userReviewDate": "Mar 19, 2012", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/2128058-angie", "userReview": "Absolutely loved reading this again - it was a hoot from start to finish. What an entertaining experience this was.Witty, sharp, hilarious and colourful are the only words I can use to describe this tale of the hapless anti-hero, Jake Donaghue. At times this reminded me a little of Richard E Grant's wonderful Withnail character of the film; theatrical, fully versed in the power of the English language, sponger, all-time heavy drinker and leading the most charmed existence possible in 1950's London. All of these ingredients mixed with a hugely imaginative plot lead Jake through a series of insurmountable twists and turns which he faces with marvellous alacrity and spirit. Add a cast of fruity and eccentric characters and a fantastical plot and you will not be able to put this little gem down."}, {"userName": "Val", "userReviewDate": "Aug 28, 2012", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/5271574-val", "userReview": "Iris Murdoch is very good at contemplative, philosophical novels. This one, her debut, is also very funny.It follows the wanderings of a young man called Jake, through London, through his thoughts and through his attempts to understand other people. He is not very good at relating to others, Jakes' world revolves around Jake. He is self-centred in a way many young men are, not because he is selfish, but because he cannot empathise, however much he might like to. This makes Jake both irritating and endearing, and completely authentic."}, {"userName": "Kirsten ", "userReviewDate": "Aug 25, 2016", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/833700-kirsten", "userReview": "I really find it hard to put in words why I have come to love Iris Murdoch. I was first exposed to her writing with The Black Prince. It isn't the plot or even really the characters that draws me in. In point of fact, I really don't like the people in her books. In this book, however, there is a lot more humor to be had. It is like a slow, drawn out Wodehouse novel. So, it must be something about her writing that I like. That must be it. It's a comfortable style. A soothing style. I will have to find more of her books."}, {"userName": "Jo", "userReviewDate": "Dec 03, 2017", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/12091097-jo", "userReview": "In doing a little prereading about Iris Murdoch before attempting her first novel, inspired by Liz Dexter\u2019s (librofulltime.wordpress.com) Iris Murdoch readalong, I was growing intimidated. Nominated for the Booker six times, won with The Sea, The Sea, a philosophy teacher at Oxford! This did not bode well for a simple, fun read and yet\u2026it was. Philosophical icons like Kant and Plato are mentioned in passing, Hugo and Jake\u2019s conversations skirt philosophical issues and towards the end even truth and God come up but these instances didn\u2019t dent the narrative momentum.On Jakes first entrance, I thought he was going to be some sulky misanthrope trying to get one over on everyone but he turned out to be surprisingly moral and romantic in both his male and female relationships. There is an element of mystery surrounding a film and a manuscript and several madcap scenes involving dogs and breaking and entering and escapes which had me chuckling -Mads the German Shepherd is a particular favorite in the book. Literature and film are represented, both high and low as well as politics in the form of Lefty and his particular brand of socialism and Iris Murdoch clearly knew her London. Her descriptions of the city and its night life as well as the descriptive passages of Paris were so evocative and made me want to fly to Paris instantly.Most of the characters were endearing or at least interesting in a caddish way. Finn, Jake\u2019s Irish friend is less well rounded than expected but individuals like Mrs. Tinckham more than make up for that. I\u2019ve heard it as a criticism that Murdoch introduces characters and then abandons them but I am one who is quite happy not to have everything tidied up at the end of the novel and say bring on the odd balls and bit players!The novel follows Jake as he makes mistake after mistake because of assumptions he has about so many things, his blindness to who people really are and what they want and when, by the end of the novel he is more or less right back where he started, it is at least with a greater awareness of both others wants and needs and his own. I\u2019m so pleased that my first experience with Iris Murdoch was a positive one and hope to read more of her novels next year whether I manage to follow the readalong or not. Next up \u2018The Flight from the Enchanter\u2019."}, {"userName": "Mark Joyce", "userReviewDate": "Jan 20, 2018", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/42499758-mark-joyce", "userReview": "I thought this was a wonderful book, though apparently the author herself didn't rate it very highly. The central character, Jake Donaghue, is a deeply flawed, self-absorbed artistic underachiever of the type that Murdoch went on to develop so memorably in later novels like The Black Prince and The Sea, The Sea. Under the Net is not as savagely funny as those books but has a greater innocence and vitality, probably because of the main character's (and the author's) relative youth. Because of this, Donaghue's meditations on love, artistic and philosophical endeavor, friendship, London, Paris and the meaning of life in general come across more as charming than preening and self-indulgent (although he is undoubtedly both of those things too). There is a chapter about a quarter of the way into the book in which Jake and his mates Dave and Finn hook up with a left-wing activist during a spontaneous drinking binge that culminates with them swimming naked in the River Thames as dawn approaches. It is one of the most evocative things I've read in a long time, perfectly capturing the joyousness of a particular type of night out at a particular time in life in a big city, and particularly that feeling of boundless optimism with an undertow of melancholy that tends to come on at the point of peak inebriation. The book is also packed with quotable passages and aphorisms, of which it's impossible to select a single favourite, so I'll go with two. This:\"I hate solitude, but I'm afraid of intimacy. The substance of my life is a private conversation with myself which to turn into a dialogue would be equivalent to self-destruction. The company which I need is the company which a pub or a cafe will provide. I have never wanted a communion of souls. It's already hard enough to tell the truth to oneself.\" And this:\"Events stream past us like these crowds and the face of each is seen only for a minute. What is urgent is not urgent for ever but only ephemerally. All work and all love, the search for wealth and fame, the search for truth, like itself, are made up of moments which pass and become nothing. Yet through this shaft of nothings we drive onward with that miraculous vitality that creates our precarious habitations in the past and the future.\"It's hard to know what to say to that, other than yes and bravo."}, {"userName": "Leslie", "userReviewDate": "Sep 09, 2017", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/11351200-leslie", "userReview": "Not particularly humorous; the inclusion of this novel under the Comedy section of the Guardian's list made me anticipate something funnier.

However, what separates Under the Net from other, similar novels is, simply, that the characters are--with the exception of Jake--not interesting in the slightest. Murdoch spends a great fraction of the book explaining to the reader precisely why Jake's friend Hugo is so interesting. This is mostly a fool's errand, as Hugo ends up sounding like some sort of tremendously boring armchair philosopher with views that I certainly could not reproduce. As with Hugo, the other key characters are boring, thin creatures with personalities that are told, not shown. While part of this is certainly a function of the frame of the novel--recollections by Jake upon these previous times--, there is no excuse for characters like Finn to get introduced by Jake with a long list of personality traits, not all of which really become apparent over the run of the novel. Additionally, the troubles that Jake encounters in Under the Net are generally so easily resolved as to be completely benign. Oh, he just got kicked out of his housing! Well, obviously, he won't actually spend much time homeless, because he's got vast wells of friendship to draw from, even if some of his friends don't particularly seem to like him all that much. Instead of suffering like Keep the Aspidistra Flying's Gordon Comstock--another ne'er do well with literary aspirations--, Jake's life is comparatively soft and cushy. Other than some very, very brief discussions of his financial insolvency, money is completely ignored, despite the fact that Jake has never held a job beyond writing and translating. Simply, as a comedic account of a struggling writer, Under the Net fails rather grandly, providing neither the expected laughs or the plot and character based hijinks should seemingly exist."}, {"userName": "Kin", "userReviewDate": "Jan 11, 2012", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/4322976-kin", "userReview": "I wish goodreads widened its rating scale. My opinion of this book falls somewhere in the area between 'really liked it' and 'it was amazing'. It's a kind of 'really, REALLY liked it'.I usually enjoy reading a novel's page on goodreads after finishing the book. Seeing my thoughts reflected in other readers' reviews gives me narcissistic pleasure and keeps at bay any urge to write my own. Today, however, I was bitterly disappointed - so many complaints against this marvelous piece! The story is too chaotic, pointless, improbable, the other characters too flat and what's with this senseless philosophy entertained by Hugo and Jake?I read those comments and could not believe what I saw. Somehow, those people managed to twist every single merit of the novel into vice. \"Under the Net\" they read is definitely NOT the one I read and liked so much. From my perspective, the narrative is elegant and gliding, with chaotic elements synthesised into a harmonious whole. The fantastic events seem only fitting for a protagonist constantly walking in his head in the clouds and expecting a thrill in every moment of his life. As for the flat characters, they owe their unreal quality to the way Jake denies them any importance or individuality outside of himself and manipulates their images to fit his own liking. This tendency is finally brought to light when we meet Hugo, who, as we realize, is not as Jake portrayed him. Therefore, I was a little amazed when I read in one of the reviews: the the personality of some of the characters is not consistent throughout the book. For example, in the first few chapters, Hugo seems to be a serious philosopher mouthing profound long lines (...) Then towards the end of the novel, especially in the hospital runaway, this Hugo resurfaced and believe me that he speaks very plainly and almost always in one liner as if he is totally a different character Well, duh. That was the point. I think that most of those people who dissed the novel simply missed its point."}, {"userName": "Jim", "userReviewDate": "Sep 01, 2012", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/6020795-jim", "userReview": "This if the first Iris Murdoch novel (her debut novel) I've read, and though I don't like to give up on a writer after only one try, I'm trying to imagine why I might want to read any more of her work. I gave the book 2 stars - 'it was ok' - because it was ok, but only just ok. She can write and form lovely sentences, but the story was so anemic and undercooked I've lost my appetite.I spent the past few days wondering \"Is there something wrong with this book? Or is there something wrong with my expectations as a 21st century reader?\" There is motion, but very little action in this book. This is a sniff of violence, but only just a dust-up at a political rally. There is nothing remotely like sex, just a bit of tender longing for lost love. In other words, you could give this book to your grandmother to read and not feel embarrassed about it's content. At it's steamiest - four drunk men go skinny-dipping in the Thames after midnight - it still barely reaches a PG-13 rating.So again, I ask, have I become so jaded that I expect sex, violence, car chases, and the occasional explosion to be a reasonable reflection of the real world? Was 1954 London and Paris such a warm and cozy place where no one was harmed, no one dropped their drawers except to swim, and where the only things at stake were closing time at the pubs and one's bank balance? And so, cultural pondering aside, two main criticisms I have are that Murdoch does not convince me that a man is telling this story. Her characterization is way more feminine than can be reasonably believed. If Jake Donahue had a bosom, it would be heaving...Secondly, Murdoch makes too many philosophical asides that take you out of the fictive world of the story. If you want to be a philosopher, write non-fiction.Again, I don't like to abandon a writer after a single book, especially their debut, so if anyone can suggest which of her novels are better, I would appreciate your thoughts."}, {"userName": "Nancy", "userReviewDate": "Jun 30, 2017", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/64963943-nancy", "userReview": "#20BooksOfSummerThe book sounds like a very simple story: young author with a fear of committment (girlfriends)refuses to apply himself and write books without paraphrasingother peoples words (Hugo).If you look beneath this narrative you will discoverthe magnificent allusions (The Aeneid) (water, rivers, rebirth) Murdoch uses.This is an amazing writing achievement ....for a first novel!"}, {"userName": "Kris McCracken", "userReviewDate": "Mar 15, 2011", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/4297611-kris-mccracken", "userReview": "Under the Net is Iris Murdoch's first novel.
