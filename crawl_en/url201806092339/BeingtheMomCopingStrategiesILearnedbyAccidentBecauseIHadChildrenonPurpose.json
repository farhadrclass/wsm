But I really think this book is a gem. Fun to read with great little tidbits of advice. I've read several times as my children have grown...especially when I just need to feel like someone else has \"been there\"."}, {"userName": "Amy", "userReviewDate": "Jun 25, 2009", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/844731-amy", "userReview": "I'm surprising myself by giving this five stars (it's not my normal five-star fare), but it was so enjoyable to read and has given me so much to think about and revisit that I really think it deserves the five-star rating (from me). That said, I don't think this will be a five-star book for everyone, so I need to clarify:First, have you ever absolutely LOVED a book, only to reread it a few years later and wonder what was so great about it? Sometimes, you just happen to pick the perfect time to read a book...where you can relate to everything in it and overlook all its flaws and totally immerse yourself in the writing. That happened to me with this book. I'm sure it has something to do with the fact that I have a new baby and my life is slowly becoming ever more chaotic. I honestly don't think I could have read this book at a more appropriate time...my feelings, frustrations, hopes, fears, anxieties, and dreams were all validated. I feel like it was truly a tender mercy to read this book just when I needed it most.Second, besides the perfect timing, many of the topics have given me a lot to ponder about. One of my favorite analogies compared life to a video game (ironic, I know, that I would like a video game analogy). There are many sections that I want to write up and post around my house so that I can see and remember them on a daily basis.Third, I don't want to give this book back to the library. I want it to be my own so I can reread sections and feel those good \"mommy-feelings\" all over again. Last, speaking of rereading, I think on a Mother's Day in the future, I will reread the book in its entirety. Nothing says five stars like \"I will take the time to read this book again.\" Depending on what my life is like at that point, I might wonder why I gave this book five stars, or it might be that I will love it just as much but in a different way.If you are a mom, you will for sure like this book, even if you don't love it...it is full of funny stories and takes a very realistic look at mothering. It will make you grateful for this very special job."}, {"userName": "Camie", "userReviewDate": "Jul 27, 2009", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/1468762-camie", "userReview": "There was only one chapter in this book that I really enjoyed. The chapter about being grateful and trying to enjoy the stages that your children are in at the moment was really touching for me. Other than that, I thought the book was advice that I have already heard and that is pretty much impossible to live by."}, {"userName": "Brooklyn", "userReviewDate": "Jan 31, 2018", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/3981715-brooklyn", "userReview": "As a foster mom two 2 elementary age children, and 1 teenager, a full time nanny to two newborn twin baby girls, and pregnant with our first, I can say that this book about motherhood is a saving grace. A reminder that we can\u2019t do it all, but that what we are doing as mothers is worth it!"}, {"userName": "Sheri", "userReviewDate": "Jul 28, 2008", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/1153707-sheri", "userReview": "Throughout this whole book, I was ready to give it 3 stars, but I enjoyed the last chapter so much, that I decided to add one more. This is a great, easy read about all the little things one needs to remember to enjoy their journey through motherhood. It had a lot of fun humor and was chuck full of thought provoking comparisons. I really enjoyed each page as I was reading it, and I laughed and teared up quite a few times. However, I am finding that I can't remember much of what I read, so I must not have taken many lessons away from the time I spent reading it. Oh well. As I mentioned before, my favorite part of the book was Strategy 10: Remember That the Years Fly By, Even Though Some of the Days Are Mighty Long. This book included all the phases of motherhood from pregnancy through your child's adulthood, then it listed out things you'll have to live through, and the things you'll want to remember. I cried all the way through each phase and I really appreciated the thoughts the author had to share. What a great book to remind a woman how important her role as a mother is, even though it doesn't always feel that way. Definitely worth reading once!"}, {"userName": "Tanya W", "userReviewDate": "Jun 29, 2008", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/1190762-tanya-w", "userReview": "This book is uplifting and harmless. I don't think the writing or ideas were particularly captivating or that I had any moments of great inspiration reading it as is the case with some parenting books. I didn't particularly enjoy it. I think it had more philosophical ideas than practical suggestions... or the strategies were so obvious that I didn't feel I came away having learned very much. I do agree with her ideas.I did check out the book and audio version, the reader on the audiobook has one of those syrupy voices that almost makes me choke and made kind of cheesy material seem super cheesy.It is a quick, easy read. Even though it really wasn't my favorite, didn't lose a lot of time reading it."}, {"userName": "Lesa", "userReviewDate": "Oct 15, 2008", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/960356-lesa", "userReview": "This books gives such good advice to moms. It is one that I plan to buy and have my own copy. I especially liked the advice she gave on saying yes to a project or task. These are the three questions you should ask yourself:1. Will it feel me in some way-creatively or emotionally or physically or socially?2. Is it important to another person's well-being?3. Can I honestly say that I have the time and money to pursue it?The only other question that I would add to that is: Do I have the energy to fulfill this task?This is a quick read, very enjoyable.Lesa"}, {"userName": "Amber Spencer", "userReviewDate": "Jan 28, 2009", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/1345152-amber-spencer", "userReview": "My mom just suggested this author to me and when I read this book I realized I had read it before - long before. So, I grazed over it (yummy) and had lots of laughs. She's a very pick-me-up person and I like her style My two favorite chapters are defintely the last two. My goal was to read one new marriage book and one new parenting book this year.

She describes many true-to-life experiences that any mother could relate to. I found the strategies good ones, but ones that I accidentally learned by myself a few years ago, okay well most of them. Okay, I'd like to think I learned those strategies. All right, I'll be totally honest and say this book was pretty valuable. But I would have to say that it would be better for soon-to-be or new mothers. Altogether, it's an uplifting and fun read."}, {"userName": "Klare", "userReviewDate": "Jun 30, 2008", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/1287248-klare", "userReview": "I have come to recently love Emily Watts and what she has to share. She spoke at a Time Out for Women that I went to a couple months ago and she ended up being one of my fav speakers. She is a mom of 5 children and she has gone through just about everything.

It is a good companion when you are overwhelmed by the responsibilities of motherhood. I love the author's humor and willingness to let herself NOT be the perfect mom.

On a side note: the author is a Mormon, so there are many correlations to that faith; another reason why it's my fave!"}, {"userName": "Melissa", "userReviewDate": "Aug 13, 2009", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/1910945-melissa", "userReview": "I think Emily Watts thinks like me, only she is a few years past some of her life experiences and can put a humorous spin on things. I read this book and I will always remember the quotes that \"you are wearing you next load of laundry\" and that \"the days are long but the years fly by.\" Both are words of wisdom to me. She was a hilarious speaker at Time out for Women in Seattle many years ago, and I enjoy this quick read that brings motherhood into perspective for me."}, {"userName": "Missy", "userReviewDate": "Feb 18, 2009", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/936165-missy", "userReview": "My favorite strategy is this: when you are faced with the option of doing something really well, over the top, fancy schmancy, or just doing a passing job, ask yourself these questions:Do I really have the time/money?Does it fill some emotional/spiritual/creative need?Is it important for someone's well-being?"}, {"userName": "Tiffany", "userReviewDate": "Aug 07, 2009", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/349296-tiffany", "userReview": "The author has a fun sense of humor.
