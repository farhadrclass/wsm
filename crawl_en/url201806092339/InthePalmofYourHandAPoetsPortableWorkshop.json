Not only was the instruction clear and helpful, but the writing is so accessible that the students looked forward to reading it. Normally, I have trouble getting my students to complete the reading, but that was not the case with this book--they loved reading it. And the assignments are wonderful because they are straightforward and easy to understand and also help the students focus on manageable writing projects.

Steve Kowit uses excellent and insightful poetic examples and his technique comments are down-to-earth and accessible. He has great insight on various elements of the poetry writing process, as demonstrated in chapters like \"The Art of Revision\" and \"Lonely as a Leftover Thumb: Figure and Image\" and \"Speeding Home in Reverse: The Controlling Metaphor.\" I would heartily recommend this book to other poets, other teachers, and even to people who want insight into how poets put poems together-- from structure to the basic mechanics of poetic language. Other than The Poet's Companion and Writing Down the Bones (two of my absolute favorites) it is near the top of my writing-books shelf (and I own dozens of writing books)."}, {"userName": "Ron Mohring", "userReviewDate": "Jul 27, 2009", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/1639840-ron-mohring", "userReview": "Though I felt initially enthusiastic about this text and assigned it in a few sections of my creative writing classes, I came to grow disenchanted, specifically with the poems provided as examples: they seemed increasingly two-dimensional and were easily replaced by *better* poems.

The same could be said for good teaching, which is what makes this volume so remarkable. In In the Palm of Your Hand Kowit employs more than 100 poems and excerpts to illustrate his discussions on everything from metaphor to meter to metaphysics. Working your way through this book--and it is work--is like sitting in on a terrific creative-writing seminar, minus the criticism (both constructive and destructive) of fellow students. If you go by the book, you'll have written at least 69 poems by the end. Because of its explication of the basic tenets of poetry, In the Palm of Your Hand might be mistaken for a beginners' book only. That would be a shame. There are so many good ideas here that more experienced poets won't want to miss out; Kowit has lots of exciting ways to invigorate one's writing. (Here's a favorite quick tip: \"A good rule of thumb is never to use a word that you're proud of.\") In the Palm of Your Hand is also recommended for members of writing groups who are interested in imposing some kind of structure on their meetings.

This is a book I turn to when I\u2019m feeling lost or too brittle. Kowitt reveals an important secret. Writers spend a lot of time writing because it gives us great pleasure! You\u2019ll discover that pleasure when you step through the exercises and assigned poems at the end of each chapter. You\u2019ll also enjoy reading the model poems by contemporary poets. If you\u2019ve never experienced San Diego poet Al Zolinas, you\u2019re in for a treat.
