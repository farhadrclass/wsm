Yes, this has got to be the loneliest group read I have ever participated in. The novel is an unfinished mystery from a classic of English literature. In the unfinished form my edition has around 230 pages and the actual mystery happens at 66% of the book length. Thus if I say what exactly the mystery is for all practical purposes it would be a complete spoiler. However from the title is can be deduced the mystery is connected to one of the character, Edwin Drood. This young guy lives with his uncle John Jasper. He is betrothed to a beautiful girl Rosa Bud (the couple's fathers took care of this way before their kids understood what it means). Most of the novel takes place in a provincial town called Cloisterham. The sleepy town still has its own shares of excitements - I mean for such place anything breaking the routine constitutes excitement, like coming of orphan twins - Neville and Helena Landless. They were literally dumped in the place by a Philanthropic Society of London. While Helena quickly befriended Rosa, Neville started behaving like a jackass or whatever was the term in the Victorian Britain. At least the gossip mongers had their hands full trying to stay abreast with the new arrivals. If you think this is not enough to make the story interesting let me mention that the first chapter takes place in a London opium den with what surely considered to be disturbing visions at the time of writing. Before I started composing my own review I read other people's thoughts about the novel looking for inspiration. Surprising number of reviewers give low rating because the tale was unfinished. Huh? How is it logical? The guy was laboriously writing the story until his death - unlike some modern writers I do not care to mention. It is not his fault he died before finishing. I strongly suspect had the author had a choice in the matter, he would have chosen to live longer (and finishing the book as a result). While I am on the subject let me mention how the book ends. The identity of the villain is very much clear. It is almost as much clear how the crime was committed and the main clue overlooked in otherwise very careful planning. It is also possible to figure out the identity of the investigator with the high probability. How exactly the tale was supposed to end in anybody's guess.Thus my fairly low rating is not due to this. The rating is influenced by the fact that this is simply not Dickens' best work, or even among his best. He could do much better - and he did elsewhere. For starters I began to think some genres are not compatible with each other. In this case a serious mystery simply refused to cooperate with satire despite the considerable writing abilities of the author. Some characters and situations came straight from satirical stories - just read practically every scene involving Thomas Sapsea and Luke Honeythunder. The mystery itself is very much serious matter. My personal nitpick: I do not like the use of present tense. In here present and past tenses are mixed and once again Dickens' writing skills almost - but not quite - made it work. There was even no good reason of doing it here by the way.On the positive side you can see the writing of a Master. New and inspiring writers really need to read his descriptions to see how it is done. For example his description of Cloisterham was fairly short and made the town truly alive in my imagination. On the other hand he spent one page describing a closet which was forgotten as soon as the description was finished, but this was the only such example. If you want to see this taken into the level of ridiculousness read anything by Victor Hugo. Anyhow even minor efforts by Dickens are well worth reading, but this time it was not an easy read. As a side note my edition has discovered fragments of Mr. Sapsea's tale. Not only they do not move the story by an inch, they also contain none of the characters from the published part except for Mr. Sapsea himself. From this point of view it was a completely pointless addition."}, {"userName": "Simona Bartolotta", "userReviewDate": "Apr 03, 2017", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/5312173-simona-bartolotta", "userReview": "\u27a1 REREAD 12/2017: Seriously, there are so many clues in here.

Pearl\u2019s literary thriller involved murder, opium addiction, autobiographical elements about Dickens\u2019s American speaking tour and affairs, international publishing rights, \u201cbookaneers\u201d (look up the term \u2013 I\u2019d never heard it before). Fascinating stuff.So I thought I\u2019d track down the source material. I was also familiar with the musical based on Dickens\u2019s book \u2013 the one in which the audience votes on the show\u2019s outcome. I saw it in its most recent Broadway revival and quite enjoyed it. The book itself, alas, isn\u2019t first-rate Chuck D. One of the main problems is the central character, Edwin, who\u2019s a bit of a cipher. Edwin is engaged to his childhood sweetheart, Rosa Bud, who, like him, is an orphan. Edwin doesn\u2019t have much ambition or personality. Edwin and Rosa aren\u2019t terribly passionate about each other. In fact, they\u2019re more like siblings. Edwin\u2019s uncle, John Jasper, is a much more compelling figure. Besides being an opium addict (and some of the early scenes set in opium dens positively ooze with atmosphere), the haunted, lecherous and terribly unhappy Jasper is also the choirmaster at Cloisterham Cathedral. In his spare time he acts as Rosa's music master, but it soon becomes clear that he\u2019d like to do more to the girl than just teach her music.Two twins from Ceylon, Neville and Helena Landless, also arrive in town. Helena befriends Rosa, and her brother Neville is smitten with her. Neville and Edwin get into a fight that was too subtle for me to really comprehend.Soon, during a requisite dark and stormy night, Edwin disappears. Was he murdered? If so, who did it? Neville, having fought him, is under suspicion, and Jasper seems happy to point the finger at him. Or... does Edwin disappear only to reappear later in disguise? (A couple of characters mysteriously do indeed show up midway through the book.) We\u2019ll never know.Dickens plants lots of details that would likely have popped up later in the unraveling of the mystery: a ring, a walking stick, a black scarf\u2026 But a lot of the writing feels laboured, particularly involving minor characters. And it\u2019s a big problem when you don\u2019t feel anything when your \u201chero\u201d disappears. Still, Dickens was a marvelous plotter, and it\u2019s unfair to comment on the book without knowing what he intended.If anything, this book makes me want to go back to Dickens\u2019s other books. I\u2019ve read the biggies (Great Expectations, David Copperfield, Bleak House, Oliver Twist), but there are still many left.Apparently this book was Dickens\u2019s attempt to write in the mystery genre that his friend, Wilkie Collins, had mastered. So perhaps it\u2019s about time I read Collins\u2019s books like The Woman In White and The Moonstone. I've been meaning to anyway."}, {"userName": "Nancy Oakes", "userReviewDate": "Jan 25, 2009", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/900340-nancy-oakes", "userReview": "I knew at the outset that Dickens died before he had the chance to finish this novel, but I didn't realize how incredibly frustrated I was going to be because of it! It seems that he was just getting somewhere, and that there was going to be some climactic action coming up shortly, and then poof. No more book. But on the other hand, it was so good getting to that point, and as noted, I am aware that The Mystery of Edwin Drood was unfinished, so I can't say that I was all that frustrated, really. It's the getting to the end (or the leave-off point) that mattered, and it was a great ride. I won't go over the story/plot here; it is very well known. Movies have been made; I believe there was a stage production or two as well, and there are (as I saw written somewhere) entire websites and pundits devoted to solving the mystery and playing \"what-if\" in an effort to provide an ending. This edition has a preface by Peter Ackroyd, a Dickens biographer, and an appendix by GK Chesterton. Chesterton provides several theories about what may have followed if Dickens had been alive to finish his work. One more thing: I read this on the heels of Dan Simmons' most excellent novel \"Drood,\" and it puts a lot into perspective.I would definitely recommend it -- if you MUST have an ending, then don't read it, but as I said above...the getting there is most of the fun.

Mentre si pu\u00f2 intuire come avrebbe potuto concludersi, la storia si gusta soprattutto per la maestria di Dickens nel creare i personaggi e nel scegliere i loro nomi: l\u2019inquietante e doppio John Jasper, un po\u2019 Jekyll un po\u2019 Hyde, di giorno irreprensibile maestro del coro, di notte oppiomane; la bellissima e infantile Rosa; l\u2019impulsivo Neville Landless e sua sorella Helena, dal luminoso volto zingaresco; il reverendo Septimus Crisparkle; l\u2019ubriacone Durdles; l\u2019ex marinaio Tartar, creatore di giardini sospesi.A tratti melodrammatico, molto spesso ironico, Dickens mi ha divertito soprattutto quando descrive i personaggi pi\u00f9 anziani. Il sindaco Sapsea, ad esempio. Qualora si assuma l\u2019asino a tipico esempio di compiaciuta stupidit\u00e0 e presunzione \u2013 una consuetudine, forse, come alcune altre, pi\u00f9 convenzionale che corretta \u2013 allora il pi\u00f9 genuino asino di Cloisterham \u00e8 Thomas Sapsea. Oppure l\u2019agguerrito filantropo Honeythunder, la cui filantropia era di quel genere bellicoso che rendeva difficile distinguerla dall\u2019animosit\u00e0. Honeythunder camminava in mezzo alla strada, facendosi largo tra gli indigeni a spallate, e sviluppando a voce alta un suo piano per catturare tutti i disoccupati del Regno Unito, cacciandoli uno dopo l\u2019altro in galera e costringendoli, pena l\u2019immediato sterminio, a diventare filantropi. Perch\u00e9, secondo Dickens, Filantropi Professanti e Pugili presentavano somiglianze stupefacenti nella conformazione frenologica della nuca: quanto allo sviluppo degli organi che formano o accompagnano l\u2019inclinazione ad attaccare a testa bassa il prossimo, i Filantropi erano decisamente favoriti.Ma il mio preferito \u00e8 Hiram Grewgious, goffo e amabile tutore della bella Rosa, molto meno ingenuo di quanto appaia. Ogni suo gesto e ogni sua parola sono puro divertimento.\u201cDa quelle parti ci sono stato di recente\u201d disse Grewgious a Edwin, \u201cmi riferivo a questo dicendo di essere certo che eravate atteso.\u201d\u201cDavvero, signore!

The first few pages were torture. I knew the novel was unfinished. At least it would be short. But why even bother at all?Then gradually there appeared light in the murk. Uncle and nephew, Jack and Eddy, got out their nuts and started to talk about Pussy.No one does dialogue like Dickens. It is crisp, clear, entertaining and lifelike. Even the way the men crack their nuts adds to the drama.Dickens is completely unafraid of sentiment. He allows the two men to be as affectionate with each other as two lovers.When Pussy comes into the story it gets even better. Everyone is in love with her. It's sickening but it's also exciting. I love this kind of melodrama.The way John Jasper stares at Pussy when she is playing the piano is fantastic. You remember it throughout all that follows and so does she. She especially remembers it many months later in Chapter 19 when John/Jack is staring at her again, dressed in mourning for the missing Eddy.At times Dickens can be so verbose that it's hard to catch his meaning but when he is describing passion his sentences are models of clarity. This chapter is called Shadow in the Sundial and the image, like so much that Dickens writes, sticks forever in your mind: This time he does not touch her. But his face looks so wicked and menacing, as he stands leaning against the sundial \u2013 setting, as it were, his black mark upon the very face of day \u2013 that her flight is arrested by horror as she looks at him. What makes Dickens's writing so thrilling is that he captures the passion of the moment in the very rhythm of his sentences. He isn't afraid of dramatic gestures.  \"There is my fidelity to my dear boy after death. Tread upon it!\"With an action of his hands, as though he cast down something precious.\"There is the inexpiable offence against my adoration of you. Spurn it!\"With a similar action.\"There are my labours in the cause of a just vengeance for six toiling months. Crush them!\"The scene builds and builds like a symphonic poem till Pussy rushes away to her room and faints half way up the stairs.There is a masterful touch at the end: A thunderstorm is coming on, the maids say, and the hot and stifling air has overset the pretty dear; no wonder; they have felt their own knees all of a tremble all day long.My knees were also all of a tremble and my heart all of a flutter while I read, and read, and read. Two semi-colons in a single sentence, by the way! There is a man who is not afraid to flout convention.The ending is, of course, abrupt and dizzying. It leaves you tottering on the edge of a precipice. My imagination was teeming with possibilities. I read a few theories about how the story might have been meant to go on but I wasn't satisfied by any of them. I couldn't help feeling that Dickens's imagination was just too ingenious, too inventive and too mischievous to be pinned down by even the most creative of scholars.So for stimulating my imagination, this was the best book by far that I have read this year."}, {"userName": "Annelies", "userReviewDate": "Jul 21, 2016", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/23628601-annelies", "userReview": "Another lovely Dickens, though unfinished.

Dickens' prior intimacy with his characters has been limited to the \"I\" narrative, his portrayal of other characters depending largely on his command of their words in dialog and his descriptive rhetoric in landscaping the situation. The author ruptures narrative distance in this one paragraph; his accomplishment challenges the adequacy of Dickens' previous novelistic art.  For the first time Dickens presents a preliterate consciousness, a consciousness in a fantastic perceptual state, as Hanry James will later do with normal conceptual \"impressions\" as well, and Faulkner of course will build whole novels like The Sound and the Fury on. Faulkner, though, was not elucidating, as Dickens here, the 19th C OPIOID Crisis, namely: opium.In Dickens the preliterate consciousness is distorted by a material catalyst, leading to what the character finds \"unintelligible.\" In our 21st C US, tea-totalling politicians produce unintelligiblity on a daily basis.  On the other hand, is there a more amusing Dickensian character than Mr Honeythunder? Or more Dickensian names than Durdles, Grewgious, Drood? Mr Jasper is the problem, or precipitates it. Dickens' intimacy with his character goes beyond Jasper's articulate consciousness, into preliterate \"impressions\" as H James would call them. Dickens' world creates a unity of self, language and action within a character which become unity of social position, morality and happiness in the finished (or ended) novel. Here Dickens has created a character, the drugged Jasper, in whom his public moral system as well as his public language holds no claim."}, {"userName": "Kyle", "userReviewDate": "Apr 14, 2013", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/11665678-kyle", "userReview": "I only partially like Dickens, so in my continuing effort to change my ways regarding Mr. Charles, I thought I would read a Dickens book that was only partially finished.

His and Rosa\u2019s fathers wished for that connection in their last wills \u2013 without making it the condition of either of the two young people coming into their property \u2013, and after all, Rosa is a pleasant enough young lady. Edwin\u2019s uncle, the Cloisterham choir master John Jasper, loves his nephew dearly, but we soon realize that he, too, has his eye on Rosa, whom he teaches in matters musical. Jasper is not much older than Edwin, but a rather jaded man, because in his heart of hearts he believes that he buried his talents in Cloisterham and that his life has no very special purpose \u2013 but then he also thinks it can no longer be helped. Trying to forget his frustration by taking drugs, he has started leading a double-life, being both a respected denizen of Cloisterham and an opium-smoker in London, and somehow his hidden addiction and his secret love for Rosa have helped unhinge his personality in that for all his attachment to Edwin, he also bears the young man a grudge for his connection with Rosa. When Neville Landless and his sister Helena arrive in Cloisterham, Jasper perceives that Neville, too, feels attracted to Rosa and despises Edwin for thoughtlessly taking for granted what he, Neville, himself would regard the source of his ever-lasting happiness and pride, and he cunningly sets the two young men against each other. Consequently, when Edwin suddenly disappears without any trace but a few personal belongings found in a river, public suspicion will centre on Neville, all the more so since Jasper has taken care of bringing the clash between the two hotspurs to public notice.Is it not frustrating and pointless to read a mystery novel the end of which we will never know? It may be so to you unless you are able to enjoy the opportunity of entering into a very close reading of this intriguing text. Practically all the hints we get seem to point in the direction of Jasper as the murderer of his relative, but then the book stops in its very middle, and it seems quite unlikely for the solution to be so near at hand. Dickens was renowned for drawing the most wondrous rabbits in the form of surprising background stories out of his hat in the last third of his later novels, and he would probably also have done this in the case of The Mystery of Edwin Drood \u2013 so much so that the rabbits, in this case, might have had the size of wombats or little elephants. Jasper does not let the grass grow under his feet but quickly proposes to Rosa, linking his offer of himself with a mean attempt at moral blackmail, and he seems to exert some kind of mesmeric power over Rosa - Dickens himself was interested in mesmerism - and to manipulate his fellow-men with spiked drinks but still, he is such an obvious suspect that by the rules of the genre, it would be very disappointing indeed if he proved to be the villain in question.But then we must ask ourselves whether Dickens really wanted to join his friend Collin\u2019s bandwagon and write an out-and-out mystery novel, or whether his main interest did not rather lie in fathoming the depths of his character John Jasper, who is the Satanic figure of the novel and shows the potential of a new, more ambivalent Dickensian villain. As my Goodreads friend Peter pointed out, Jasper evokes associations with no lesser work than  Paradise Lost: He regards Cloisterham as his personal hell, his artful machinations fuel people\u2019s basest instincts, in the masterly chapter \u201cShadow on the Sun-Dial\u201d, he mirrors Satan\u2019s doings in the Garden of Eden, and he even quotes from Milton\u2019s masterpiece, turning the hopeful phrase \u201cThe World was all before them, where to chose / Their place of rest\u201d from the last book into an underhanded taunt to arouse Neville\u2019s ire and jealousy against Edwin. Dickens may have thought that the potential of this villain Jasper, his inner, schizophrenic, dichotomy of good and evil held so much interest and promise that it would have been worthwhile to sacrifice the coup de th\u00e9\u00e2tre of a mystery novel in order to grant it full swerve. His treatment of Bradley Headstone in Our Mutual Friend shows that he was striking new artistic paths.On the other hand, how can you explain the stonemason Durdles\u2019s account of \u201cthe ghost of a cry\u201d he heard the previous Christmas and Jasper\u2019s dismayed reaction to this tale unless you assume that Dickens was about to unfold a surprising background story in the second half of the book. Maybe, this story would also have shed some more light on the lives of some of the parents, whom we hear about solely through their children, Edwin, Rosa, and the Landlesses?Be that as it may, I felt a lot more fascination than frustration when reading this novel, due to the fact that the absence of a clear solution induced me to pay vivid attention to every little detail of the story, much more so than I usually do when reading a mystery. And then I console myself by thinking that the Great Library in Heaven \u2013 there simply has to be one, after all, or it wouldn\u2019t be Heaven \u2013 must surely have the missing second part of The Mystery of Edwin Drood, leather-bound and with a ribbon page marker, and, what\u2019s more, written by the Inimitable himself, ready for me to peruse one day. Hoping that much, I also hope that in case I will have, through some error, of course, to go to that other, less well-air-conditioned place, there will be a reliable interlibrary loan system."}, {"userName": "Sandra Ba\u0161i\u0107", "userReviewDate": "Apr 11, 2018", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/32538982-sandra-ba-i", "userReview": "\u0160teta \u0161to je Dickens umro prije dovr\u0161etka knjige, ostaju otvorena pitanja..."}, {"userName": "Stacy LeVine", "userReviewDate": "Mar 07, 2009", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/1705328-stacy-levine", "userReview": "THE MYSTERY OF EDWIN DROOD took me a whopping 10 months to conquer.

We never find out what opium and all the lugubriousness associated with it have to do with anything.Worse still, several new characters are introduced in the unintentionally \u201cfinal\u201d chapters and, thus, doomed to eternal superfluousness by the author\u2019s death. This is particularly frustrating, for surely Dickens would have brought them all cleverly into the fold by the end. (He always did.)Worst of all, we never find out what the hell happened to Edwin Drood. Uch!This is the point at which I bitch at the Master for not finishing his book. It\u2019s well known that the Dickens canon is verbose\u2014if not an shamelessly over-written\u2014because he was paid by the word.GREAT EXPECTATIONS (my all-time favorite novel) reads almost entirely as (brilliant) plot, and thus, the verbosity flows quickly. A TALE OF TWO CITIES, on the other hand, is heavy on florid illustrations of history and morbid musings on humanity. With THE MYSTERY OF EDWIN DROOD, we\u2019re talking two-page diatribes on teapots in the homes of minor characters.Because the reader is painfully aware that the book doesn\u2019t end, the wasting of words on inanimate objects becomes deeply upsetting.Thus, I close with a personal message to the Master, wheresoever his divine soul may be:Dearest Mr. Dickens,You should\u2019ve skipped the teapots, sir.But rest in peace, just the same.Stacy"}, {"userName": "Peter", "userReviewDate": "Dec 04, 2017", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/23418160-peter", "userReview": "Well, it is rather hard to evaluate a book when it is yet to be completed, but this book will not be concluded, so I must judge it not by its cover, but rather by its incomplete promise. This book marks a fresh style for Dickens. While all his books have some mystery in them, they are not mystery novels as such. Here, however, we do have a mystery as our title tells us. In the early going Dickens develops a wonderful tone with the fictional cathedral town of Cloisterham and offers a grand opening in London, but a London as experienced through the senses of an opium addict. A series of interesting characters form around the narrative, there is love and desire in the air, a clash of egos and emotions and then, voila, Edwin Drood disappears. We are left with one obvious candidate for the person responsible for Drood\u2019s disappearance, but wait, there then is another and another and then, well, it is Dickens so almost all the characters in the novel could be potentially the guilty party, or at least associated with the guilty party.Consider the range of characters in the narrative. Sailors, opium sellers, jealous suitors, seemingly benevolent clergymen and a church official who loves looking around gravestones all rumble towards the reader. The momentum is high, the speculations of the reader are in high gear and then, tragically, Dickens dies. While some friends and his illustrator and members of Dickens\u2019s family all claim to have some knowledge of how the novel will end, the truth is no one definitively knows. The Mystery of Edwin Drood must remain a mystery.Read the novel and join in with the legions of others who have tried to solve the crime.

'Here,' he said, 'I knew you'd be interested in this.'\u00a0He was right. After all, when we first formed the club I'd expressed a particular interest in filling the Dickens-shaped hole in my education. I'd rather had in mind something like Oliver Twist or The Pickwick Papers, but this seemed as good a place to start as any.\u00a0My knowledge of this particular book was more scant than usual. I knew of it only in passing \u2014 it was the book that Lucy had been reading when her farm was attacked in J.M. Coetzee's Disgrace.\u00a0Just as Lucy didn't get to finish reading the book, so Dickens didn't get to finish writing it. It was originally intended as a periodical over 12 instalments, but only six were completed before he died. I hadn't realized this, so it was an immense disappointment to get to the end and discover that it was only the middle. I wish Ernie had told me.\u00a0Like an un-climaxed session between the sheets, as it were, I had now no choice but to roll over and give myself some pause to consider the thing for what it was.\u00a0Naturally, my first instinct was to attempt finishing the story in my mind. It was obvious that Mr Jasper was probably Edwin Drood's murderer, if indeed he was actually dead, and I like to imagine that Mr Datchery was really Mr Brazzard in clever disguise, but what's the point of speculating like this? We shall never know, and if your interest lies in endings and denouements, and in those only, let me recommend that you don't even start with this story.\u00a0Of greater interest to me was Dickens' story-telling and style. If I am really to fill that hole, this is something I shall have to get to grips with straightaway. For want of anything else to analyse, I may as well take from this experience something that will help me through my further adventures with Dickens.\u00a0Let me start with his characters. Dickens paints them with broad, uncomplicated strokes. The names he chooses for them should be evidence enough of this: Tartar, Landless, Crisparkle, Rosebud. This is not to say that his figures are of few dimensions, but they seem to me to be caricatures nonetheless.\u00a0I can hardly imagine that those who populated Victoria's England should be any less complex than people of today, but Dickens seems to have preferred this manifest in action than articulated in thought. He spends as little time as necessary examining the internal machinery and far more relating the external evidence of character. It occurs to me that this might have been forced by the circumstances of his time: then, clothes and manners and language made the man, while today we are more comfortable with convoluted assessments of the same man's internal cogs and wheels and how his history and experience shape his unique and multi-faceted set of motivations and drivers, some good, some not.\u00a0Perhaps I'm mistaken. Perhaps, rather, we like to think today that we are more enlightened in our estimation of others, but I suspect that we are still as black and white in our final appraisal as Dickens ever was.\u00a0The next thing is his language. This took some practice to understand. There were times when I had to re-read some passages, especially at first. I'm not unfamiliar (falling into one of Dickens' favourite habits \u2014 the double negative) with this, having learned Shakespeare's language with great reward, and Chaucer's and even Beowulf's (with less reward), but it took some doing. The circumlocution in both speech and description was especially difficult. More than once I asked myself whether people really spoke, let alone thought, this way a century and a half ago.\u00a0I don't know \u2014 perhaps they did \u2014 but here's the thing: once my mind was attuned to the indirect path, to the scenic, long way round, it worked. There was a temptation at first for me to regard Dickens' ambling prose as prissy etiquette, as constricting and unnecessarily circuitous, but as I became more practised, it came into focus as far more colourful and emotionally satisfying than I had thought it capable of being.\u00a0There is a place for the direct, brutal, Hemingway-esque highway of story-telling, but its opposite, now typified in my mind by Dickens \u2014 the country byway of flowery speech and euphemism and sensitive, slow examination of the subject \u2014 has risen, by my estimation, to equal status.\u00a0This must then be the hole I was seeking to fill all along. So yes, Ernie, thank you for allowing me first dibs at this little gem. I wish you'd told me, though."}, {"userName": "Jeanette  \"Astute Crabbist\"", "userReviewDate": "Apr 20, 2009", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/796425-jeanette-astute-crabbist", "userReview": "I'll tell you one thing for free-----the ending sucked! :DI don't know how to rate a book that's only half-written due to author demise.

Indeed, my own expectation is that in the first half of a book the Problem has been announced and all the main characters (their motives and flaws, not to mention possible contributions to the eventual resolution) have been introduced, and (Note well!) TMOED is the entire first half of Dickens' planned novel. So I had fun watching him at his craft.The plot is...well, Dickensian. Two wards, Edwin and Rosa, betrothed since they were little according to their fathers' wishes, decide as the marriage approaches to end their engagement and just be friends. Before communicating this development to his uncle, John Jasper (who is in love with Rosa), Edwin disappears. The reader does not see what transpires. Nor is it clear why Jasper, mourning the loss of his nephew, is so distraught over the broken engagement when he hears of it.Even though the word \"mystery\" appears in the title, this book is not a mystery in the whodunit sense. The reader knows the identity of the murderer, the clues that will lead to his indictment, even the murder weapon. What is not known, and never shall be known, is the WHY. Various endings have been proposed over the 140 years since Dickens' death. I lean toward Dickens' own words. In a letter to a friend he told of wanting to write about an uncle who murders his nephew...I take this to mean that Jasper kills Edwin...and in his final hours in prison, the uncle tells his story...I take this to mean that Dickens was looking forward to narrating the grisly, dramatic details of the murder scene and revealing the larger story and Jasper's stake in it.Not only is Dickens' last novel full of wonderful characters and great writing, it is a spur to reading discussions of this puzzling book and to knowing more about Dickens' craft."}, {"userName": "Mary Lou", "userReviewDate": "May 11, 2016", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/7098587-mary-lou", "userReview": "How does one rate half a mystery?

Maybe I'll change the rating daily (four, three, four, three) for the rest of my life.\"The Mystery of Edwin Drood\" opens with three men and a woman sprawled across an \"unseemly\" bed, two of the men in a stupor, the woman smoking opium, and, emerging himself from a haze, John Jasper, a man who will figure prominently in this novel. We're a long way from \"The Pickwick Papers.\"\"The Mystery of Edwin Drood\" is, in fact, dark, lean, not as panoramic and funny as early Dickens. It also is, despite being a half-told tale, quite good. Jasper is a jealous uncle to the title character; Edwin's future marriage to Rosa Bud is an arranged one. Edwin disappears \u2014 very likely murdered \u2014 shortly after he and Rosa mutually break off the engagement (a fact of which Jasper, besotted with Rosa, is unaware). The \"mystery\" in the title coupled with the tale's unfinished status might tempt some \u2014 likely its non-readers \u2014 into thinking that the identity of the perpetrator has vanished in the mists of time. But \"Edwin Drood\" isn't really about whodunnit \u2014 we're quite sure we know, and the little evidence that exists of Dickens' plans certainly seems to confirm our obvious take on what happened. What the novel is about, and doubtless would have explored more deeply if completed, is the psychology of Jasper, a voice in the church choir and by outward appearances an upright man, whose darkness sometimes creeps out in threatening body language amid otherwise cool control.Dickens expertly peels away layers of Jasper's cunning; it is presumed the author would have brought us even further into Jasper's head \u2014 and taken him into his own.Other strong characters stand out, including Septimus Crisparkle, a canon of the church who also stays in great physical shape by shadow boxing. Personally, I love Deputy, a boy hired by Durdles, a stone mason and inscriber of gravestones. Deputy's duty? Throw stones at Durdles if he stays out past 10 o'clock at night \u2014 to, in fact, stone him home. Love that!The book does drag at times, primarily in the first 50 pages (despite the atmospheric opium haze of the opening) \u2014 when Dickens seems uninspired \u2014 and after Edwin's disappearance, when there's a sluggish recharging of the batteries.What perhaps resonates most, though? What a shame it is that the novel never was finished; it could have been one of Charles Dickens' major works. Instead we're left with questions and empty speculations. Who was the mysterious Mr. Datchery? Could he be another character in disguise? What to make of the opium woman? How would Dickens have resolved the crime (assuming it was a crime)? What would have been Jasper's end, and how would his fascinating psychology have been further explored? Sadly, we'll never know. Onward, then, to more Droodian darkness.

But, having only read three Dickens novels (A Christmas Carol,  David Copperfield, and Bleak House), I felt I had a good grasp on Charlie and his style to merit making this my fourth Dickens book.I was wrong. I probably should have gone with Great Expectations or another of the titles sitting on my bookshelf.Dickens' trademark eccentric caricatures and sparkling dialog abound in this book; but what was unexpected was that these caricatures were more important that the actual story. The development of the criminal mind of John Jasper, the choirmaster of Cloisterham and main antagonist of Drood, seems to be Dickens' focus. The wit of the whole (or the whole of what we have--only the first twelve chapters were actually published; the remaining 13 were found in Dickens' papers and later published) is creepy and atmospheric, but without the charm of Dickens' earlier works, I found the book to be more tedious than enjoyable. Perhaps I will be able to appreciate this unsolved mystery more at a later time, but for now The Mystery of Edwin Drood will have to remain a book that I am glad I read, but did not enjoy as much as some of the author's other works.Finally, let it be known that Gerald Dickens, the great great grandson of Charles Dickens (who I met in November of 2015 when he performed A Christmas Carol in KCMO) suggested that I get a few more novels under my belt before I tackle Drood.

There are flashes of the genius writer Dickens was that I know and love, particularly in the relationship between Edwin and Rosa who just can't get on despite being betrothed, and there's a wondeful scne where they call it a day and go their separate ways. Tthe inclusion and descriptions of the opium den, the strangeness of many of the characters in the book, their delightfulself-importance (or extreme humbleness) the wonderful names of courses (Mr. Crisparkle!) and the intricate plotting all point to this being typically Dickensian. Yet, there's also a sense that Dickens was trying to push himself in new directions yet again and this time, maybe because of his ill health, he just can't seem to find the compelling voice of his best work and there are many chapters that just feel awkward, out of place and a little dull.It's impossible to judge the book without a conclusion and who knows, Dickens intent may have become clear with the bigger picture.

It was thus in 1869 that he began writing his final novel of which the first six of the originally intended twelve monthly parts were published in 1870.

At the center of the story is Edwin Drood, his fiancee Rosa Budd, his uncle John Jasper, Canon Crisparkle, and the Landless twins, with others to numerous (as was Dickens' way) to mention. The style is fresh and new for Dickens, especially when contrasted with the heavier more convoluted style of Our Mutual Friend which immediately preceded it.

Shortly afterwards, in the middle of a storm on Christmas Eve, Edwin disappears, leaving nothing behind but some personal belongings and the suspicion that his jealous uncle John Jasper, madly in love with Rosa, is the killer.
