I'm incredibly grateful for this and you can see my follow-up response in the link above.In the aftermath of this apology, I have edited my review for a less hostile tone (and to cut out my overuse of the word \"literally\" lol). My original review can be read here: http://whittynovels.tumblr.com/post/1...TW: Abuse, rape****SPOILER ALERT****I would give this zero stars if I could. Since I was on the plane when I began reading this, I was unable to snapchat vlog how much I hated it. Therefore, here\u2019s my list of complaints in word format:\u2022\tFallon describes herself as being \u201cobsessive-compulsive\u201d about hygiene. You could just say you find hygiene important instead of belittling an actual mental illness for a hyperbole. \u2022\tHomeboy (Ben) eavesdrops on a conversation Fallon has with her father in a restaurant, then when she says she hasn\u2019t had a boyfriend, he SLIPS INTO THE BOOTH NEXT TO HER AND PRETENDS TO BE HER BOYFRIEND? WTF THE FUCK? GO SIT BACK AT YOUR OWN TABLE. STOP TOUCHING HER AND CALLING HER LADYBUG AND BABY. 1-800-DID-NOT-ASK AND WAS NOT INVITED. \u2022\tI\u2019m tired of every colleen hoover being about a girl with self-confidence issues. Even worse, in this one, the MC has disfiguring scars, which just worsens the fact that Hoover would exploit trauma and burn victims to establish a character trait.\u2022\tLITERALLY THE ENTIRE FIRST CHAPTER IN BEN\u2019S PERSPECTIVE IS TALKING ABOUT HER BOOBS AND WHAT COLOR UNDERWEAR SHE IS WEARING. WHAT THE FUCK???? HOW IS THAT SEXY OR ROMANTIC FOR A GUY TO BE FANTASIZING ABOUT UNDRESSING A GIRL IN HIS HEAD BARELY TWO MINUTES AFTER THEY MEET????? \u2022\tFURTHERMORE, (I\u2019ll stop using caps now bc I feel like I\u2019m wearing it out but please do bear in mind that I\u2019m furious) he literally says \u201cif we\u2019re just going to sit here and stare at each other, it\u2019d be nice if she were showing a little cleavage, instead of wearing this long-sleeved shirt that leaves everything to the imagination. It\u2019s pushing eighty degrees outside. She should be in something a lot less . . . convent-inspired\u201d (pg. 24). IT\u2019S CHAPTER 2 AND YOU\u2019RE ALREADY DICTATING HOW SHE SHOULD DRESS?????? OH MY FUCKING GOD I WANT TO TEAR THIS BOOK APART\u2022\tA few paragraphs later he starts looking at her scars and he\u2019s like \u201cAre [her breasts] scarred, too? How much of her body is actually affected?\u201d And I get that it might be a genuine curiosity to see her and wonder how much of her body is affected by the burns, bUT YOU CAN\u2019T JUST ASK SOMEONE THAT OR BLATANTLY FANTASIZE ABOUT UNDRESSING THEM JUST TO SATISFY YOUR CURIOSITY ABOUT THEIR DISEASE OR SCARS!!! I literally don\u2019t understand this. This is absolutely disgusting. \u201cI begin to mentally undress her, and not in a sexual way. I\u2019m just curious. Really curious.\u201d (pg 25). WTTTFFFFF??????!!!!!!!!!! this is so wrongly voyeuristic and completely fetishizes her scars.\u2022\tI call bullshit on this book. I know the romance genre is unrealistic because it\u2019s mostly just womens\u2019 wish fulfillment, but a straight, not unattractive guy swooping in to save a girl from a verbally abusive dad, buys her dinner, is a creative writing student, etc.? It doesn\u2019t happen. This doesn\u2019t exist. \u2022\tI\u2019ve always gotten subtle homophobic vibes from Hoover\u2019s books, but on page 28 MC says \u201cNo gay man I know would have left the house looking like you do right now\u201d and just the outright stereotyping and trying to use that to be funny is just gross. Assuming every single gay man puts fashion on an alter is so stupidly stereotypical and I\u2019m angry about it. \u2022\tAhhh. Page 34. He begins to get all romantic and heavy and saying \u201cwant to know what I was thinking about when I saw you for the first time?\u201d and we thought we were going to get a touching story about looking past her scars at her beauty but nope. Full paragraphs talking about her ass and him wondering if she was going commando. The objectification of women in this one is so undeniably and painfully real. \u2022\tBen basically navigates throughout this book doing whatever he wants without asking Fallon\u2019s consent and then forcing her to do things because he thinks she\u2019s uncomfortable for no reason. It\u2019s just disgusting that the man\u2019s presence in this book is written so much more naturally and commandeering in this book. \u2022\tFor instance, there\u2019s this entire scene where Ben wants her to wear this really revealing dress and she doesn\u2019t want to but he keeps pressuring her to and finally Fallon is about to have a panic attack and cry and she\u2019s squeezing her eyes shut because Ben is running his hands along her shirt and unbuttoning it (WHICH DEFINITELY MEANS FUCK OFF SHE DOESN\u2019T WANT YOU TOUCHING HER FUCK YOU BEN FUCK YOU) and he finally takes off her shirt and looks her over and it\u2019s so uncomfortable and nonconsensual and totally inappropriate having only met a few hours ago. then he taKES OFF HER PANTS AND DOES THE SAME THEN TELLS HER TO LIFT HER ARMS AND PHYSICALLY PUTS THE DRESS ON FOR HER and I just wanted her to literally slice him in half like I\u2019m so done with him. He is the opposite of romantic and if I were to ever encounter him in person I would literally stomp him like a roach.\u2022\tMay I just say that when he was telling her what dress to wear, he literally said \u201cI\u2019m paying for dinner, so I get to choose what I stare at while we eat.\u201d Is that not a characteristic of an abusive boyfriend to be so controlling to force her to wear what he wants her to wear? And they\u2019ve only been \u201cfriends\u201d for 3 hours? \u2022\tBen tells her, 3 hours into their friendship, I quote, \u201cIt\u2019s your own fault people feel uncomfortable looking at you.\u201d I can\u2019t even make this up. He tells her it\u2019s her fault that she has burn scars, that they make her feel self-conscious, and the reaction people have to them. If I didn\u2019t already hate this character so much I would actually tear him to shreds with my bare hands.\u2022\tYou wanna know what the male gaze is? It\u2019s a male supposed-love-interest saying shit like \u201cThere\u2019s just enough showing at her neckline to keep me good and happy.\u201d Because women, their boobs, and their lowcut shirts exist to make men \u201cgood and happy.\u201d Barf. Gag. Vomit.\u2022\tHE LITERALLY SAID TO HER, \u201c . . . you could very well be as dumb as a rock. But at least you\u2019re pretty\u201d (pg. 57). WAY TO FUCKING OBJECTIFY A WOMAN TO REDUCE HER TO HAVING NO CAPACITY FOR INTELLIGENCE AT ALL, AS LONG AS SHE\u2019S WEARING A LOWCUT SHIRT. \u2022\tThere\u2019s this scene where he\u2019s running his hands along her scars. He asks, \u201cis this okay?\u201d asking for consent. Great. Awesome. But she responds \u201cI don\u2019t know.\u201d And he fuCKING KEEPS GOING. NOPE. YOU RUINED IT. GOODBYE. I\u2019M NOT EVEN SURPRISED SHE\u2019S DESCRIBED AS HAVING TEARS IN HER EYES THE NEXT PAGE. BECAUSE YOU FUCKING KEPT GOING WHEN SHE DIDN\u2019T CONSENT TO BEING TOUCHED MORE. \u2022\tThey start outlining rules for what to do between the time that they\u2019ll see each other again and whereas fallon\u2019s are things like \u201cread these books and have fun,\u201d ben\u2019s is literally, \u201cgo on dates. You don\u2019t have enough experience for girls of your age.\u201d Like, great. That makes me feel really good about myself. Great job. \u2022\tShe eventually reveals that her left breast was disfigured from the fire and in the next line of dialogue ben is like LET ME SEE IT I NEED TO SEE IT CONSIDER IT RESEARCH I WANT TO KNOW. Like in what the fuck world is that acceptable? It\u2019s her number one insecurity and he\u2019s such an entitled asshole that he\u2019s like \u201cuhhuh cool but let me see it. Because I\u2019m curious.\u201d\u2022\tEvery sexual advance after that wasn\u2019t because \u201cyou\u2019re beautiful I love you,\u201d it was, \u201clet me take off your clothes so I can see the scars you keep trying to hide.\u201d So disgusting.\u2022\tI think the saddest thing is Fallon never stops Ben from doing anything. She continually complies, even if it causes her to have tears in her eyes, shakiness, etc. She has so much internalized misogyny that she allows men to control her and tell her what to do and she contributes it to the alpha male personality in the romance books she reads. I\u2019m so, so upset for her that she can\u2019t stick up for herself, and Ben disguises his exploitative, disgusting, and toxic obsession with her scars and undressing her as concern and love. \u2022\tThey were talking about their favorite foods. Ben said Pad Thai. Fallon said Sushi. \u201cthey\u2019re almost the same thing . . . [because t]hey\u2019re both Asian food\u201d (pg 121) lmao okay\u2026\u2026\u2026\u2026..\u2022\tFuck the Tate and Miles cameo. I fucking hate Miles. \u2022\t\u201cI step forward and shut her up with my mouth\u201d lollolololol I hate this. I fucking hate this. Let her speak. Stay in your own fucking lane. You don\u2019t dictate when she needs to shut up, especially kissing her forcibly to make her stop talking. \u2022\t\u201cHe kisses me with entitlement\u201d is a real fucking line in the book. It literally just proved my point. Ben thinks he\u2019s so entitled to her body. This is actually a perfect summary of any CoHo book you\u2019ll read. Such arrogant, ridiculous, entitled men.\u2022\tAfter she loses her virginity to him, she literally describes it as she \u201clost a part of [her]self to the person inside [her] . . . as if the second [they] joined together, a tiny piece of [their] souls got confused and a piece of his fell into [her] and a piece of [hers] fell into him.\u201d IS THIS NOT THE EXACT WORDING OF ABSINTANCE-ONLY SEX ED??? TELLING GIRLS THAT THEY ARE POLLUTING THEMSELVES AND GIVING AWAY PARTS OF THEMSELVES TO MEN WHEN THEY LOSE THEIR VIRGINITY????? VIRGINITY IS A CONSTRUCT. YOU AREN\u2019T LOSING ANYTHING. YOU ARE AN INDIVIDUAL PERSON EVEN AFTER SEX. OH MY GOD THIS BOOK IS UNBEARABLE PLEASE MAKE IT END.\u2022\tfuCKING GUESS WHAT IT GOT WORSE\u2022\tthe next morning she was like \u201cI gotta go\u201d and he literally said, I quote, \u201cI\u2019ve never wanted to use physical force on a girl before, but I want to push her to the ground and hold her there until the cab drives away.\u201d He literally threatens physical violence on her. BUT SO CUTE AND RELATABLE!!!! AM I RIGHT???!!!!!\u2022\tHe actually gets pissed when she refuses to let him move in with her and exchange numbers. Like cry me a river, fuckboy. \u2022\tThis book is just so outright woman hating. Ben has such frail masculinity. He was like \u201cFallon said she hates insta-love, but apparently she hates semi-instant love and slow love and love at a snail\u2019s pace and love in general.\u201d Like way to villainize a woman because she wants the best for you???? Horny motherfucker, go take a nap. \u2022\tAt this point I stopped taking notes because shit was happening every paragraph but here\u2019s the rest of what I remember\u2022\tSEVERAL times in this book, Fallon tells Ben \u201cI need to leave\u201d and he either grabs her, stands in front of the door, or otherwise blocks her exit. That\u2019s extremely controlling and nasty. \u2022\tAt one point she tries to drive away from him but he grabs her keys out of her hand and walks to his own car, forcing her to scream after him and follow him to get them back. He walks all over her life and calls it \u201calpha male\u201d romance.\u2022\tNear the end of the book Fallon\u2019s out on a date with another guy and he shows up and is super manipulative pretending like he\u2019s interviewing them for an article or some shit, but he\u2019s actually just creeping on the guy she\u2019s with because he hates how she\u2019s moved on from him. That\u2019s so controlling and disgusting? Literally leave her alone, she\u2019s with another man? What the fuck? Grow up?\u2022\tDuring this same scene, Fallon is drunk at the bar and Ben takes her, drags her down a hallway, corners her there, demands to know who he is, and Fallon laughs. Hoover continually normalizes and REWARDS this behavior by making the main female character perceive it as humor or protectiveness.\u2022\tAt one point she tells him \u201cI need to get back to my date\u201d and it says that he \u201clean[s] closer and sandwich[es] her against the wall,\u201d then he says, \u201cDon\u2019t be like that . . . I\u2019ve been through hell today trying to find you.\u201d OH, OKAY, SO YOU STALKED HER, CORNERED HER, AND NOW YOU FEEL ENTITLED TO AN EXPLANATION? ENTITLED FOR HER TO LEAVE HER CURRENT DATE FOR YOU? I hate this man. Fuck his privilege and entitlement. \u2022\tAt this point I\u2019ve yelled so much. I\u2019m going to try and stay calm for this one because it\u2019s the most serious one. While they are in a bar together\u2014Fallon drunk, Ben sober\u2014he pulls her into a storage closet and they begin making out. Ben initiates this. Fallon is hesitant but complies. He starts touching her, and clear as day, she tells him \u201cStop, . . . [her] voice louder than it\u2019s been all night.\u201d This is an absolute, loud, clear indication that she does not want to proceed. But what does Ben do? His hands continue to \u201cgraze the edge of [her] panties\u201d and he whispers\u2014he fucking whispers to her face\u2014\u201cI\u2019m trying. Ask me again.\u201d He didn\u2019t stop. He. Didn\u2019t. Stop. THIS IS RAPE CULTURE. I TOLD MYSELF I WOULDN\u2019T USE CAPS BUT IN A COLLEEN HOOVER BOOK THAT HAS A 4.45 RATING ON GOODREADS, THE MAIN CHARACTER TOLD THE LOVE INTEREST TO STOP DURING A HEAVY ROMANCE SCENE AND HE CONTINUED TO SHOVE HIS HAND UP HER SKIRT WHILE SAYING, \u201cASK AGAIN.\u201d (UPDATE 2/18/17: Hoover will be editing this out of the book. https://www.facebook.com/AuthorCollee...)\u2022\tAt this point in the book, I was done. Then the plot twist occurred.\u2022\tThe plot twist just secured this book\u2019s place in hell for me. Ben was manipulative. Ben lied. Ben was voyeuristic, trying to see her scars because HE. CAUSED. THEM. This isn\u2019t cute. This isn\u2019t romance. This is a drunk driver running a red light and hitting another car, nearly killing a passenger, and then stalking, abusing, and preying on the passenger who now bears scars because of his reckless behavior. Behavior that she. Forgives. Him. For. And Hoover subsequently normalizes by publishing this book. By publishing this book, Hoover has said, \u201cit is okay to allow men to get away with this behavior if he loves you. If it was an accident. If he had good intentions. If he\u2019s angsty. If it was meant to be.\u201d\u2022\tFallon\u2019s father, who at the beginning of the book told her \u201cyou\u2019re too ugly for broadway, no one will hire you, your career is over, boys don\u2019t love you, etc.\u201d is posed as \u201cmisunderstood\u201d and someone who doesn\u2019t know how to communicate. HE RECEIVES FORGIVENESS. FOR THE DESPICABLE WORDS HE SAID TO HER AT THE BEGINNING, HE RECEIVES FORGIVENESS AND AN EXCUSE. \u2022\tI have to stop this, otherwise my head is going to explode. I\u2019m not shaming anyone who likes this book, but I can\u2019t believe it has escaped notice of so many people. I can\u2019t believe I\u2019m the only person who\u2019s livid.This is the end of my support for Colleen Hoover. Her books aren\u2019t going to half price books, they\u2019re going in the trash."}, {"userName": "Aestas Book Blog", "userReviewDate": "Feb 20, 2014", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/5604583-aestas-book-blog", "userReview": "::: FULL REVIEW NOW POSTED. SPOILER-FREE ::: \n\n\u201cIf she\u2019s not careful, I might just fall in love with her. Tonight.\u201d\n\nWOW. WOW. WOW!!!! November 9 blew me away!!! I read it in one sitting with my heart racing the whole time!! The story was SO unique and unexpected that it took me completely by surprise over and over again!! I swooned, I fell in love, my heart was broken, and then healed again. And THE TWIST!!!!! Holy hell, that twist!!! Total shocker but I LOVED it. This book was perfect from cover to cover and definitely one of the BEST BOOKS of the year!! 5 stars!! I went into this story completely blind without knowing anything other than what the blurb said and knowing the fact that it was a standalone. My personal recommendation is that you do the same thing. Try not to read anything about the plot and just dive right into the story! As such, I\u2019m not going to talk about the storyline at all here \u2014 this is a spoiler-free review \u2014 and instead, I\u2019m only going to share the blurb:\nFallon meets Ben, an aspiring novelist, the day before her scheduled cross-country move. Their untimely attraction leads them to spend Fallon\u2019s last day in L.A. together, and her eventful life becomes the creative inspiration Ben has always sought for his novel. Over time and amidst the various relationships and tribulations of their own separate lives, they continue to meet on the same date every year. Until one day Fallon becomes unsure if Ben has been telling her the truth or fabricating a perfect reality for the sake of the ultimate plot twist\u2026\nNow in complete honesty, blurbs usually over-exaggerate when they say things like \u201cfor the sake of the ultimate plot twist\u201d but I promise you that wording is fully deserved here!! I genuinely did not see the twist coming and I absolutely loved that it surprised me! It just gave the story that extra *ooomph*!This book starts off by just throwing you right into the story. You hit the ground running and it\u2019s a non-stop ride until the very end. As you can guess from the blurb, the story takes place over several years focusing on Fallon and Ben\u2019s single day together each year. I fell in love with them together. Each time, I desperately waited for them to reconnect and couldn\u2019t wait to see where each new year would take them.\n\n\u201cYou can\u2019t leave yet. I\u2019m not finished falling in love with you.\u201d\n\nI was especially impressed with the way their relationship was set up so strongly that even after spending an entire year apart with literally no contact, they could pick up like they\u2019d never been separated.\u201cHe slowly plants kisses down my neck, keeping my hands secured to the bed, not allowing me to touch him back while he explores my skin. God, I\u2019ve missed him. I\u2019ve missed the way I feel when I\u2019m with him. I wish I could have this every day. Once a year isn\u2019t enough.\u201dPS: this is a complete standalone (not part of a series) but there\u2019s a secret something in this book that\u2019s guaranteed to make you SQUEE if you\u2019re already a fan of Colleen Hoover\u2019s books!!! Anyways, I started this book late at night but ended up staying up til the wee hours of the morning to finish it because I just needed to find out what happened next for Fallon and Ben. The more I read, the more my heart squeezed. I was deliriously excited for their reunions, while being kinda scared about what would happen each year while they were apart. My heart was in my throat!!!! I felt ALL THE FEELS!!!\n\n\u201cShe\u2019s the only one I want with me today, and here she is.Just for me. Because she missed me.If she\u2019s not careful, I just might beg her to stay.For good.\u201d\n\nOhhhh and this story really built up. My gosh, there was this one specific point where seriously guys, I was raging!!! OMG. My stomach dropped. I was so mad that I was practically shedding angry tears. I was furious to the point of not believing I could ever forgive [that person]. I was done. MAD!!!!! But ohhhhh how the grovel was epic! It was so epic that it actually did make me genuinely feel for and understand that character and believe the apology in a way that made me forgive what I thought would probably be unforgivable and still fully love that character. To me, that\u2019s a sign of damn good writing!!In the final hour of reading this book, I went from full on freaking out, angst-filled, stomach dropping rage to sitting with the biggest silliest, happiest grin on my face basking in all the warm happy feels.I really found it to be amazing how these two characters could literally spend only a matter of hours together over the years and still have me wholeheartedly believe their love for each other. But I really did. I felt the feels, believed their love, understood the mistakes, cheered for the victories. I loved it so much!\n\n\u201cThis is real life, and in the real world you have to bust your ass for the happy ever after\u2026 When you find love, you take it. You grab it with both hands and you do everything in your power not to let it go.\u201d\n\nIsn\u2019t that an awesome quote??This book was unique, unexpected, gripping, addictive, a lot of fun, but angsty at times, and also totally swoon-filled and beautiful because the truth is that no person is perfect and even the best of us make mistakes. What counts is whether we learn from them, and how we repair the damage, and how far we are willing to go to prove our love for each other no matter what happens. I really felt like (regardless of whether I agreed with them), I understood these characters and I absolutely adored their beautiful yet unconventional love story. I laughed, cried, swooned, and fell completely in love.I have loved every single book that Colleen Hoover has written. Her stories just reach right into my heart and this book was another top-notch winner \u2014 a truly fantastic top recommendation!\n\n\u201cI think about you every second of every day and I don\u2019t know how to get over you,\u201d she says.\u201cDon\u2019t,\u201d I beg her. \u201cPlease don\u2019t get over me.\u201d\n\nThis is one of those books you\u2019ll want to drop everything to read the moment it\u2019s live!Rating: 5 STARS!! Standalone romance._______________________________________ For more of my reviews, book news and updates:\u2726 Main blog: Aestas Book Blog\u2726 Facebook Blog Page\u2726 Twitter \u2726 Subscribe by email"}, {"userName": "Emily May", "userReviewDate": "Nov 10, 2015", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/4622890-emily-may", "userReview": "\u201cWhy would a girl care to find herself when she\u2019ll never be able to make herself feel as good as a guy can?\u201d\nI've said this before, but I'll say it again: I like Hoover's writing, I like her concepts for novels that differ from the standard format of NA romance books, I really enjoyed Never Never and I also liked Confess. This book, however, reminded me of all the reasons her stories and characters have annoyed me in the past.The relationship between writers and the truth is something I find fascinating. I especially like it when authors structure their novel so it's like a book within a book, or a story within a story, and you can't be sure whether you're reading the \"truth\" or what the writer wants you to believe. November 9 touches upon that concept... barely.But the reality is it just isn't done very well. From that opening quote that had my jaw dropping in horror at what I was reading to the weird apologies made for bad romance novels. Seriously, this should be called \u201cin defence of shitty romance novels\u201d or \u201chow to write a shitty romance novel\u201d because all the tips are here. The book tries to make excuses for itself through the use of Ben being a romance writer. Fallon doesn't like instalove (one of my own biggest pet peeves) and yet both her and Ben conclude that they did have a kind of instalove. But, you know, acknowledging something doesn't necessarily make it okay. In this case, it doesn't at all.Fallon is so annoying and melodramatic. I swear she must cry at least once per chapter. Also, she makes some sweeping, dramatic statements that seem off. Why does she think it would be a normal reaction for Ben/her hypothetical boyfriend to dump her after witnessing her argument with her father? What a drama llama. Just imagine it... your boyfriend sees you having an argument with your dad and he's like \"oh wow, that's it, it's over\". I wouldn't think that was normal, I'd think \"what a jackass\".Ben is another controlling douche wrapped up in a gorgeous \"I give you new self-esteem\" package.\nI shove the dress back at him. \u201cI don\u2019t want to wear that, I want to wear this.\u201d\u201cNo,\u201d he says. \u201cI\u2019m paying for dinner, so I get to choose what to stare at while we eat.\u201d\nBe still my beating heart, I think I'm in love < /sarcasm>He also, at one point, interrupts Fallon and puts his hand over her mouth so she can't speak while he delivers this big speech about how beautiful she is and only she cares about her scars. Which, as the book shows, actually isn't true, and also: get your controlling hands off her mouth, douchebag!So, those are the characters, but there were other things I didn't like. Like the fact that Ben quotes poetry when he sees her naked and they're about to have sex (eww) and he says this cringy line:\n\u201cBaby,\u201d he says, his lips forming a smile. \u201cYou have already made this the best I\u2019ve ever had, and I\u2019m not even inside you yet.\u201d\nAnd, oh my god, when he finds out she's a virgin:\n\u201cFallon,\u201d he whispers, dragging his lips slowly across mine. \u201cThank you for this beautiful gift.\u201d\nOh, please. Just let me unsee it. Ugh. Ugh. Ugh.Then there's the fact that the blurb refers to \"the ultimate plot twist\" which can really only be one thing. The characters lives are not developed enough that there are multiple possibilities regarding the twist. It was so obvious what it had to be about.And, finally, the plot/angst wasn't very well-conceived. I honestly didn't buy into their reasons for not being together - it seemed like excuses made to prolong the story. I've experienced what it's like to meet someone new, click with them instantly, and become completely wrapped up in them and your emotions. You generally do whatever you can to be with these rare people; you do not come up with crappy excuses why it won't work.Fallon and Ben like each other, they\u2019re falling in love with each other, but oh no, they can\u2019t be together. It\u2019s not time. They would just distract one another from their goals. What a load of bullshit.Also, one last thing. This is a small matter, given all the other criticisms I have, but can we stop using stereotypes for gay men? And can we stop saying that the guy over there can't possibly be gay because he forgot to shave today? It's just stupid.

HOW CAN YOU DO THIS TO PEOPLE!?! I must seriously love abuse because I keep coming back for more of it when it comes to your books!\u00a0 This could be the last book I read all year and I would be perfectly content with it. November 9 is stunning.\u00a0All us book nerds have one serious thing in common when it comes to reading... We love book quotes! We love to say them, we love to share them, we love to make pictures with them, we just seriously love them. November 9 hands-down has some of my favorite book quotes in it. Not just from things I read this year, from things I've read in general. If I could, I would just copy and paste the entire book as my review and just leave it at that. It's all just so beautiful.November 9 follows Fallon, a girl who meets a young writer (Ben) the day before she's set to move cross country. With a seriously silly introduction it leads these two characters to spend her last night in town with each other. This becomes the inspiration for Ben's first novel and for the two too met up every year on the same day. I seriously can't get over these two. They're both so easy to fall in love with. Fallon with her insecurities and Ben with his boyish charm will win your heart over within a few pages. Fallon is this character who is struggling to find her footing again in life, and Ben who knows what direction he wants to aim, but needs the arrow guided. I liked their ups and downs. I liked how their struggles became our struggles. We get to grow with these characters and we get to go through so much time with them. Fallon and Ben will make you feel every single emotion. One page these two would have me dying laughing then I would turn it and the next I would be crying so hard I couldn't breathe. Their relationship will have you second guessing your hate for insta love. That's all I'm going to say character wise... Vague I know, but if you've ever read a CoHo book (if you haven't where the hell have you been?!?) you know the last thing you want is to be spoiled on characters.\n\"What are you waiting for? He drags in a raspy breath. 'To wake up, I think.' He lowers his mouth and kisses my neck. 'I'm dreaming, right?'\"\nOkay, I'm just going to warn you now, the vague character description is going to be the only organized and put together part of this whole review. From here on out it's going to be a jumbled mess of spoiler free fangirl talk... You've been warned.The plot... OMG the plot. It's a sucker punch from all directions. It's an uppercut to the face, an elbow to the stomach, a smack to the ear of pure emotion thrust upon you. Let me break this down for you... The first few pages I was all lah-tee-dah minding my own business being all swoony over all the possibilities of where this story could head... WHEN OUT OF NOWHERE I GET FREAKING THROAT PUNCHED BY THE MOST ROMANCE SCENE I HAVE READ IN MY ENTIRE LIFE... AND THIS IS FROM A GIRL WHO HAD READ A BUTT TON OF BOOKS!!! I mean good God and it's only 50 pages in!!! I wanted to lay a book worthy kiss on Ben so hard, because that moment is pure perfection. Every girl deserves a Ben! Maybe someone can invent a pocket sized version of him, and whenever were having an ugly day (ladies you know what I'm talking about) you can pull out your pocket sized Ben and he can pay you compliments and make you feel like the princess you are. If you can't tell by that bizarre thing I just said, then let me just come right out and say it, I was completely hooked. I was just sitting on the sofa sobbing. Then it's scene after scene of these perfect stolen moments, breathtaking events, and heart stopping romance that you'll be rooting for... But don't get too comfortable because you know one of those epic CoHo twist are going to happen... AND THIS ONE IS THE PITS! When it happened... I couldn't breathe and I swear I almost threw up. Feeling all emotions at once hit me so hard it almost induced vomiting... But mainly just caused me to do that heavy cry where you can't even function or form words and all your sentences come out in broken fragments. Pain swept my legs out from under me.\n\n\nSafe to say overall I could barely function reading this. This story is just everything. None of that probably made any sense and I don't care. You know a book is good when you're so jumbled and have so many emotions that it's physically hard to get all of them down. Oh and don't get me wrong with this review. It's not just love and pain in this novel. CoHo has this hilarious thing where she pokes fun at the everything she is doing with this book. Not just that she has this fun way of poking at everything all of us secretively love in books. It's just great! If this wasn't all enough for you there's something a little extra special she puts in this novel that had me jumping all over the place that I can't freaking wait for y'all to read. You can really tell she put her whole heart into writing this book for fans and really set out to give them something to love.November 9 is a beautiful book with a wonderful message. It's a novel filled with so much passion, humor,\u00a0 with such a dreamy aspect that leaps off the pages and pulls you in. November 9 was my most anticipated New Adult book of the year, and again Colleen Hoover didn't let me down. By the end of November 9 I promise your heartstrings will have been pulled in every single direction.

She is one of those authors that leaves a stamp on her work. Her plots seem to have this special twist, her story lines are always unique and her characters are witty, wonderful and flawed. When I read November 9 I expected greatness. This is a CoHo book. And I wasn't disappointed. November 9 is a day on the calendar. One day out of 365. It\u2019s a day that I\u2019ve never really thought about, but from now on, I don\u2019t think this date will pass without me thinking of Ben, Fallon, and their story. When I read the blurb for this book, I was intrigued. At first I thought- such a cool idea. Then I thought, how is this going to work? \nThis is a book that put me through the ringer. My emotions were all over the place. It made me feel. It made me stay up all night reading. There were points I was sad, points i was angry (it\u2019s been a while since I\u2019ve been this upset at a character\u2026. still not over it LOL), and points my heart was bursting full. I want to talk about the story, but I can\u2019t talk about the story. It\u2019s one of those you don\u2019t want to know to much about. Be surprised and let the emotions consume you. \nNovember 9 is the perfect mix of humor, twists and turns, love, angst and it has that Colleen Hoover stamp that is unmistakable. You will laugh, you will cry, if you\u2019re like me, you might be so full of frustration that you want to throw your kindle a time or two, but by the ending, you\u2019re left with an unforgettable story that is real, raw and riveting. \np.s. there were some fantastic and fun bookisms in this story and every single one of them put a smile on my face!"}, {"userName": "Caleb", "userReviewDate": "Dec 26, 2016", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/16381356-caleb", "userReview": "This is the worst book I've ever read. This is the most pathetic excuse of a romance I have ever read. The love interest treats the main character like a pawn and takes advantage of her. He acts like he has ownership of her and manipulates her through her insecurities. He tells her exactly what she wants to hear and then proceeds to get what he wants. He wants her mostly for sexual reasons and when he tells her that she's pretty, he gets access to her. The main character has zero self confidence or respect for herself and gives herself to a douche bag the second her calls her pretty.Don't say this book isn't insta love because they fall in love within the course of an hour. This book tried to redeem the horrible love interest in the end and it failed. He was horrible and she apologizes to him when all she did was want the best for him. He ruined her life, but it's okay because he had a tragic backstory. No. This book will go down as the worst book I have ever read and I plan on never picking up another Colleen Hoover book ever again unless someone can heavily convince me otherwise. This book is blatantly sexist and perpetuates gender stereotypes. It even pokes some lines about the MC have mental illness when she clearly doesn't. Don't read this book unless you want to rip your hair out and question why people actually enjoyed this pathetic excuse of a love story.Oh and btw there's a scene where the MC is really drunk and clearly not thinking straight and then the love interest shows up and starts kissing her. She tells him to stop but he proceeds, responding with \"i'm trying to.\" Then he continues even after she says she is uncomfortable. He also takes off her clothes multiple times and she is thinking to herself that she doesn't want it. The love interest basically sexually assaults her multiple time but it's okay because he has a tragic backstory.UPDATE:Colleen Hoover says she will be removing the rapey scene in the book when the next printing of the book happens. I'm really happy that she saw the problems in the book and changed them instead of doing nothing. I have a new respect for her since a lot of authors wouldn't even care about problems as long as their book is selling. I still have A LOT of problems with this book and it still remains my least favorite ever, but I do respect Colleen Hoover for this decision. ALSO:Everything I have said about this book are FACTS. Stop telling me I have an interesting opinion on the abuse and manipulation in this book because I can cite about a million sources PROVING this. I think some of you guys need to look at this book without biased eyes and try to understand that this relationship is NOT healthy and NOT something you should strive for. You need to take a step back and look at the problems and not normalize them as \"entertainment\". I don't want any of you to read this book. Not because I didn't enjoy it because I think you all deserve more."}, {"userName": "Mo", "userReviewDate": "Mar 19, 2014", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/11856352-mo", "userReview": "Note to self ... \"Give up on NA/YA, Maura!\"As others have said, it is hard to write this review without giving anything away so I won't say too much.Too cheesy for me.Too much drama.Too many coincidences.Her books are a hit and miss for me.

I want to kiss her so bad it hurts and now I can\u2019t smile because I\u2019m in too much pain.\nIt\u2019s like that all story long.I\u2019m not saying that I have a cold heart and can\u2019t appreciate \u201cromancey\u201d passages. It just doesn\u2019t fulfill my definition of true, honest and realistic love.In other words, this book is extremely cheesy. And, since we get both Ben and Fallon\u2019s chapter point of views, the cheesiness really stands out and becomes ubiquitous.\n\u201cOne of the things I always try to remind myself is that everyone has scars,\u201d she says. \u201cA lot of them even worse than mine. The only difference is that mine are visible and most people aren\u2019t.\u201d\nThen why do you keep complaining about it?She\u2019s always self-conscious about her scars, which appeared after she survived a fire. It\u2019s all she thinks about when in company of others, especially guys. Are they staring at me? Do they see me as a monster? Am I repulsing to them?Just stop.I understand that her confidence is low due to the scars, but does she have to whine about them all the time and continuously mention them? I vote for a no.\n\u201cTake a seat. Fallon\u2019s in the shower.\u201d I glance at the couch and then at the hallway that leads to Fallon\u2019s bedroom. \u201cYou don\u2019t think she needs my help in the shower?\u201d\nThe humor is another thing that I couldn\u2019t stand. I NEED it in my contemporary reads, otherwise I quickly become disinterested in the story. But the humor in this book is of very poor quality. It\u2019s bad, so bad.\n\u201cWhat if we meet up again next year on the same day? And the year after that? We\u2019ll do it for five years. Same date, same time, same place. We\u2019ll pick up where we left off tonight, but only for the day. I\u2019ll make sure you\u2019re following through with your auditions and I can write a book about the days we\u2019re together.\u201d\nThe premise is the entire reason why I even started this novel. Not because it\u2019s a Colleen Hoover book, not because of the cover or even the hype. To me, the idea of someone writing his own love story sounded fascinating.Yeah, right.Maybe it could have worked. Maybe with other characters it might have been less annoying, unrealistic, eye-roll worthy and cheesy.It\u2019s not badly written. Colleen Hoover knows how to express emotions:\n\u201cIt pisses me off that you allow something so trivial to define such a huge part of you. I can\u2019t make you pretty in this book, because that would be an insult. You\u2019re fucking beautiful. And you\u2019re funny. And the only times I\u2019m not completely enamored by you are the moments you\u2019re feeling sorry for yourself. Because I don\u2019t know if you\u2019ve realized this yet, but you\u2019re alive, Fallon. And every time you look in the mirror, you don\u2019t have the right to hate what you see. Because you survived when a lot of people don\u2019t get that lucky. So from now on when you think about your scars, you aren\u2019t allowed to resent them. You\u2019re going to embrace them, because you\u2019re lucky to be on this earth to see them. And any guy you allow to touch your scars better thank you for that privilege.\u201d\nExcept, who would ever give this kind of perfectly structured speech to another human being?Maybe it\u2019s my cynical side that\u2019s speaking, but I couldn\u2019t take this book seriously. It didn\u2019t convince me. DNF at 40%.***If it convinced YOU, then I\u2019m glad! Books are there to be read, and we either enjoy them or not.

I love everything CoHo writes, but this one didn't work for me. Let me start from the beginning: I really liked the premise of this book and it was one of my most anticipated reads of the year, I was really excited when it came out and wanted to love it! I've read some really great reviews and my hopes were high! But oh, it didn't meet my expectations. To explain myself, let me give you an actual quote from the book. \n\"Why would a girl care to find herself when she'll never be able to make herself feel as good as a guy can?\"\nJust... what even...????And also... THE LIST OF QUOTES I HATED FROM THIS BOOK:\n\"Her boobs. Both of them. I know. I'm pathetic. But if we're just going to sit here and stare to each other, it'd be nice if she were showing a little cleavage...\"\nI shove the dress back at him. \"I don't want to wear that, I want to wear this.\"\"No,\" he says. \n\"I'm paying for dinner, so I get to choose what to stare at while we eat.\"\nNOPE. SHE WILL WEAR WHAT SHE WANTS.\n\"Baby, you already made this the best sex I've had, and I'm not even inside you yet.\"\n*cringes*And when she was about to lose her virginity to him...\n\"Fallon... Thank you for this beautiful gift.\"\nOHGODWHY.And those are not all of them, just the ones I remember. And those are said by Ben, the male protagonist, the one that's supposed to make us fall in love with him. I don't really understand Fallon, there's a scene that really disturbed me the first day they met, he undresses her \"not in a perverted way, it was just curiosity\". RIIIIGHT.The thing is... I don't really like Ben. He has some other great quotes and he's a funny guy sometimes, but he's by far the worst fictional boyfriend Colleen ever created (in my opinion). And Fallon... I kind of like her sometimes, but she's too melodramatic. There are also good things in this book, as I said, there are some funny quotes that really made me laugh and there are also some really nice quotes that I loved... Examples:\n\"It doesn't take a paycheck to validify that you're a writer.\"\n\n\"Please don't tell me you're one of those pretentious readers who judge people by the books they like.\"\nAfter their first kiss...He pulls back in shock, .\"Seriously? That's all I get? A seven?\"I shrug. \"I've read some great first kisses.\"\n\"Confort can sometimes be a crutch when it comes to figuring out your life.\"\n\n\"I'm never going to meet anyone who makes me feel the way he does. People don't get this lucky more than once in the same lifetime.\"\nAnother thing that I really liked is that Miles and Tate from Ugly Love made an appearance and it was SO CUTE!!! I'll not spoil you, but their relationship is going really well :'). Miles deserves it. The truth is I love Colleen Hoover and even if this book disappointed me, I'll still read everything she writes. She's still one of my auto-buy authors. I don't know what happened with this one... I think I'm just tired of the same formula she always uses: A guy with a tragic past and drama and angst and more angst. Or maybe I'm just not into NA anymore.

I\u2019m amazed at CoHo's ability to deliver a unique story with each and every one of her books. After I was done with November 9 I spent a good hour or two discussing it with Kara. There\u2019s so much I want to say about it but really you can only do that with people who have read the book so not to ruin the story for others.One thing that surprised me was when a certain couple made a cameo. It put a smile on my face. I'm so use to CoHo not following book trends that it was pleasant surprise to see the crossover. CoHo\u2019s men have a way of getting me worked up and not in a good way. It started with her first book Slammed and has continued on in her other books. While they make me want to smash my kindle against a wall, they also make me appreciate the realness of the situation. CoHo's love stories are guaranteed to have the ability to provoke strong emotions in the reader.My favorite aspect of the story is how the book flowed so well together even though the story took place over a large time span.

If I love or hate a book, I don't care how hyped or popular the book or author is, you will get my honest opinion no matter what. I will be the first to admit that I am a huge fan of Colleen Hoover's writing. Her books are always high on my favorites lists and she is an auto-read author for me. Despite the fact that I did not like this book at all and that it didn't work for me one bit, she is still one of my favorite authors and I will still be rushing to read her next book. Unfortunately, and it pains me to have to say this, but November 9 just wasn't for me.From the summary, this book always made me a little nervous for several reasons. 1) It immediately reminded me of the plot for One Day. 2) I always have issues with romances that start from just one day of knowing each other. 3) The hint about Ben possibly hiding something had me worried this would have one of those shock value plot twists, which I normally hate. But, it's Colleen-freaking-Hoover and there was no way I was not reading this book. I was super excited to get an early copy and despite the fact that October was only reserved for Netflix binging, I couldn't help myself and had to read this book. The thing that upsets me the most is that November 9 had so much potential and the first few chapters showed so much promise. At first, it was just a few things here and there that bothered me, but eventually almost everything started bothering me and combined, it just didn't make this an enjoyable book for me. Since there were so many things that bothered me, I'm gonna list these in a non-spoiler and spoiler section below. If you are avoiding spoilers, simply skip that part and head to the end to my non-spoilery final thoughts. :)Non-spoiler list of things that bothered me:- The first thing I had an issue with was the fact that Fallon was scarred on most of her body and face from a house fire that cost her her acting career. Now, I'm not this monster that expects or wants all MC's to be perfect and beautiful and flawless, but this goes back to one of my main problems that I have with New Adult and the fact that everything has to be so fucking tragic. I thought we were at the point in NA where we were past characters needing a tragic past, but apparently not.-Speaking of New Adult, my friend Megan wrote an awesome Almost Break-Up Letter to New Adult last week and while I was reading it and was agreeing with all her points, I would have never thought a Hoover book would fall victim to so many of those annoying and clich\u00e9 NA traits. We had tragic pasts for both characters, drama overkill, plot twists that felt like they were simply added for the sake of shock value, recycled tropes that have already been done in previous/popular NA books, super cheesy lines, and conflict that seemed really forced. Just to name a few.- Ben was too perfect in an unrealistic way. Hoover's male characters always seem to have this really intense feel to them, which I don't mind at all. But in Ben's case, there always felt something off about him. He literally came out of nowhere to save the day and offer to be Fallon's pretend boyfriend in front of her dad. What would have resulted in a one time thing turned into so much more when he stayed with her a few hours while she packed for New York and broke down barriers that no one else could in only a few hours, like letting him take off her clothes. He said just the right things to make Fallon feel better about her scars. He asked Fallon to date around while she was in New York for a year so she didn't 'miss anything', and he sounded like an inspirational coach half the time while the other half he said some really cheesy shit. Things like:\n\"Baby,\" he says, his lips forming a smile. \"You already made this the best sex I've had , and I'm not even inside you yet.\"\nand this lovely gem as he's about to take her virginity:\n\"Fallon,\" he whispers, dragging his lips slowly across mine. \"Thank you for this beautiful gift.\"\n-And speaking of cheese, Fallon said some really cheesy stuff too that made me roll my eyes.\nIt felt as if the second we joined together, a tiny piece of our souls got confused and a piece of his fell into me and a piece of mine fell into him.\nor:\nI just know that there is no way I can tell him goodbye after this. It'll tear me apart, way worse than last year. I can't go another day without him being a part of my everyday life. Not after this.\nKeep in mind that this is after he 3rd November 9th they have spent together, roughly 12 hours they have spent together in total since they first met and after the first time they have sex....- Towards the end of the book, by about the fifth November 9th they've spent together, Ben and Fallon have only spent a grand total of 28 hours together. This is one of the main reasons why I had such a hard time connecting with not only the story, but with Ben and Fallon as a couple. As stated in the summary, Fallon and Ben only meet once a year on November 9th, the day they met. This all sounds romantic, but it didn't work for me in a number of ways. Ben and Fallon agree for some reason (more on that later) that they should have zero contact at all during the years they are apart. They block each other on social media, they never give each other their phone numbers or emails so they don't talk, text or email. Basically, they just show up to an agreed location on November 9th at a certain time and hope the other is there. They have no idea if either of them have met someone else or any of the normal every day things that happen in life. Meanwhile, they always act like theirs is an epic love story despite the fact that in reality they just really basically strangers who happen to have a 'connection.' Each time they met, we had 1-2 chapters in his point-of-view and in her point-of-view and it was on to the next year.-The fact that this was sort of a book with in a book felt like a cheap ploy to quickly address and dismiss any issues the reader may have, which honestly felt like an insult to us readers. Because Fallon is an avid reader (and gets Ben to read books too) and Ben is a writer, they kind of make fun of certain book scenarios while falling victim to those clich\u00e9s. Fallon tells Ben early on that she hates insta-love and when she explains to him what insta-love is and he says that it sounds like what they must have, she quickly dismisses it. Years later when it comes up again, we are supposed to buy this half-assed explanation with this:\n\"You know how much I dislike insta-love.\"\"Oh, it was still insta-love,\" I tell her. \"But ours is legit.\"\nIsn't that what every author says about their insta-love romance in books? Later on when they have sex, Ben muses about how as an author he has no words to describe that moment in paper so he will just have to... fade to black. Which is exactly what the book does at that moment. After reading Ugly Love, we all know Hoover is capable of writing really great and classy sex scenes. This approach came off as lazy. It felt like Hoover used the fact that Ben was an author, and Fallon was a reader to shut down any problems. I mentioned earlier that the plot of this book reminded me of One Day by David Nichols (which I have read). There is a scene in here that really bothered me when someone brings up the comparison:\n\"It's a little bit like Sleepless In Seattle'\" Tate says.I immediately shake my head. \"It's nothing like that. They only agreed to meet once.\"\"True. I's like One Day, then. That movie with Anne Hathaway?\"Again, I dismiss her comparison. \"That just focuses on one particular day every year, but the two people still interact throughout the year like normal. Fallon and I have no contact.\"I don't know why I'm being so defensive. I think writers just naturally become defensive when their ideas are compared to other ideas, even if it's done innocently. But mine and Fallon's story is one-of-a-kind, and I feel somewhat protective of it.\nI don't like the fact that an international best seller book is reduced to simply an 'Anne Hathaway' movie. I especially dislike it since Hoover is an author herself. I'm sure it was innocent, but this bothered me.-Another one of my issues with this story is that the conflict always felt forced. The reason why Fallon moves to New York is because he mother says that you don't know who you are until you are 23 years old, and you shouldn't date until then because if you don't know yourself how can you fall in love. And she always listens to her mother because her mother is always right. Something that Fallon feels the need to remind us of several times. So, she moves to New York to try to find herself and put herself out there to try to help out her career. This is all fine, but Fallon is 18 and alone and miserable in New York. And this doesn't explain the fact that she and Ben can't talk on the damn phone or text or email each other, even as friends. Years later, when Ben wants to move to New York to be with Fallon so they could be together, a family tragedy forces Ben to stay home. Or should I say, convinces Fallon that Ben has to stay home and once again can't have any contact with her. For his own good, of course. All of this just felt really forced to me.Spoiler things that bothered me:-When Fallon breaks Ben's heart and leaves to New York again, she shows up the next November 9th expecting to find a happy-go-lucky Ben. Instead, Ben is dating his dead brother's ex-wife and is raising his brother's son with her. She is hurt and angry, even though she's the one that told him to stay to help her. Even though she's the one that left without refusing to give him her number. She says something that really annoys me:\n\"And no matter who is at fault for that, whether it's mine for walking away last year or yours for not knowing I did it for your own good, none of it changes things.\"\nThe whole 'I did it for your own good' move is stupid and condescending and overdone.- Plot twist: It turns out that Ben is the one that set fire to Fallon's dad's house two years ago. Intentionally. That day he pretended to be her boyfriend, he was following her dad and fully knew who she was. This kind of negated all the 'your scars are what makes you beautiful' and 'you are lucky to be alive' and all that other after-school speeches he gave her. After that, I never really knew if he really felt that way, or if it was out of guilt for being the cause of that. I know this came as a huge shock to most readers, but it only annoyed me because the whole 'I'm responsible for your traumatic accident and now I'm gonna seek you out to ease my guilt' has been done before in Ten Tiny Breaths by KA Tucker and Leaving Paradise by Simone Elkeles.- The reason that Ben set Fallon's dad's house on fire is because Ben's mom killed herself. He found some letters with his name on them and he assumed that they had an affair and he was responsible for his mom killing herself. I would also like to point out that this assumption is incorrect.- Not only did Fallon have a tragic past (the fire), but Ben did too (his mom killing herself). This felt like overkill for a number of reasons. Ben's mother had terminal cancer and she didn't want to be a burden on her sons. So she shot herself in the head. In their home. Knowing that Ben was there at the time and he would be the one to find her since it was only the two of them that lived there. How terrible and fucked up is that reasoning? Couldn't have she taken pills or something that wouldn't result with her brains being splattered all over her bedroom? What was worse was the suicide note she left for him:\nI know this will be difficult for you to deal with, so I've tried to make it as easy as possible. Someone will need to clean up after they take my body, so I've left a card on the kitchen counter for who you should call. There's plenty of cash in my purse. I've left it in the kitchen, on the counter.'\nSomeone give her the mother of the year award so being so thoughtful!- In case you missed it, Ben's mom killed herself on November 9. That same day he sets he fire that ruined Fallon's life. Two years later, that's the day they first officially meet. So that date has an important significance for a number of reasons. All of which I'm sure were meant to add to this supposedly epic romance, but only ended up being over he top.Spoiler-free final thoughts:I'm not saying that you should not read this book or that's its terrible, because a) that's a shitty thing to say and b) everyone has different tastes. Just because I thought this was Hoover's weakest book and I pretty much hated it, there is no denying that she is one hell of a talented writer. I just honestly think that this was missing the certain.... Hoover feel that makes all her other books stand out and hit you right in the feels. The fact that every single review on Goodreads is 5 stars and nothing less, really makes me question the state of book blogging right now and how honest certain people can be when it comes to reviewing hyped books or books by author 'friends'... I also really wish authors would find beta readers that aren't friends that can be truly objective...November 9 was one of my most anticipated books of the year and I don't know if I'm more disappointed in the fact that this didn't work for me because it's written by Colleen Hoover, or of the fact that this Colleen Hoover book didn't work for me. If you're on the fence about this, I suggest you read reviews by bloggers you truly trust. And if you do decide to read this book, I hope you like it better than I did. No matter what I thought about this book, I'll always be looking forward to read her upcoming books and I still consider her one of my favorites."}, {"userName": "Yonaily ", "userReviewDate": "Feb 26, 2014", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/22496761-yonaily", "userReview": "Ugh, I hate NA.

STOP writing insecure girls who fall for the douchey \"you don't know you're beautiful, that's what makes you beautiful\" boyfriend. STOP writing relationships that are based on LIES and SECRETS. STOP writing slut-shaming bff's. Please....On page five I was excited. On page fifty I had a terrible feeling about this read. One page 100 I wanted to cry because every single thing these characters said was cheesy and dumb. Honestly, guys, IT WAS SO BASIC AND SO WRONG. I would've never expected this from CoHo. Just look at these quotes:\nI laugh again, and then I press my face to his chest and hug him back, because why couldn\u2019t he have been there the second I woke up in the hospital two years ago? Why did I have to go two whole years before finally being given the tiniest bit of confidence?\n\n\n\u201cYou wear your hair like you do because you don\u2019t want people to see too much of you. You wear long sleeves and collared shirts because you think it helps. But it doesn\u2019t.\u201d\nHe's definitely a fan of One Direction. \n\u201cI don\u2019t want to be your first, Fallon. I want to be your last.\u201d\nSorry I just threw up in my mouth a little bit.\n\u201cBaby,\u201d he says, his lips forming a smile. \u201cYou have already made this the best sex I\u2019ve ever had, and I\u2019m not even inside you yet.\u201d\nOops, it happened again. Not only are Ben and Fallon walking clich\u00e9s but the plot-twist is something you would find in -you guessed right!- any other book of the genre. But I wonder if it can really be considered a plot-twist since it couldn't have been more obvious. \n\u201cDoes she know, Ben? Does she have any idea that you\u2019re the one who started that fire? That you\u2019re the reason she almost died?\u201d\nNice try but it was too obvious, honey.So Ben lied about everything and instead of telling her the truth about the accident first-hand, he made her fall in love with him and wrote a book about their beautiful story blah blah blah. So yeah, it gets worse: \nI make a new pile with the pages I\u2019ve already read. I stare down at the manuscript in disbelief. I know I should be angry that he\u2019s lied to me for so long, but being in his head is somehow justifying his behavior to me. And not only that, but it\u2019s also justifying my father \u2019s behavior.\n\nYou know that's what abusers do, right?\nWe were drawn to each other. We made each other happy. And I know without a doubt there were several times during the past few years that we were madly in love with each other at the same time. Not everyone experiences that Fallon, and I\u2019d be lying if I said I regretted it.\nSO YOU DON'T REGRET CAUSING THE ACCIDENT THAT ALMOST CLAIMED HER LIFE, TELLING EVERYTHING ABOUT IT TO YOUR BROTHER SO YOU COULD BOTH PROMISED YOU WON'T TELL IT WAS YOUR FAULT?????????????\nI should have given you the chance to explain it then. If I had just listened to you, then we could have avoided an entire year of heartache. So for that.... I\u2019m sorry. I\u2019m so sorry.

But it\u2019s also so much more. It\u2019s lines of words that tell the story of a girl scarred by an event that made her feel less, made her feel abandoned. A girl whose dreams vanquished with the flames that ravaged her. It\u2019s about a boy, a writer\u2014Benton Kessler\u2014who searches for inspiration and finds it the day that fate pushed him to meet Fallon O\u2019 Neil.Fallon and Ben meet on her last day in L.A., before she moves to New York City.

You just turned me into a crying mess! Now I'm in a full on sob fest.I don't think this review of mine can give justice to this amazing novel but let me just tell you that November 9 is simply beautiful! And beautiful does not even begin to describe it. It's BOOK-WORTHY. The kind of book that will hook you, consume you, and OWN you from the very beginning up to end.November 9 begins when Fallon O'Neil and Ben Kessler met at a restaurant in Los Angeles on the 9th of November. Despite having an instant connection with each other, Fallon thought that she's not yet ready to fall in love and commit herself into a relationship, thus she told Ben that she'll start dating him only when she reach the age of 23-- which will be five years after their first meeting. Before she moved to New York, they both decided to meet once a year-- same place, same date-- November 9. So I thought that was just all about it. And I was wrong. Because there were too many things that happened in this book and the PLOT was done in an outrageous and intricate manner. That's how I know that Colleen Hoover once again did a great job-- when she was able to make me pause and contemplate about the series of events in the story. \n\n\"When you find love, you take it. You grab it with both hands and you do everything in your power not to let it go. You can\u2019t just walk away from it and expect it to linger until you\u2019re ready for it.\n\nWhat especially made me love the book were the main characters. Ben and Fallon are well fleshed-out characters. Ben especially. This man. I appreciate Ben's character because it's so easy to connect with him. He has a way words that can melt one's heart. Not to mention what a damn hot writer he is. And Fallon-- although I had some issues with her inconsistency, I grew to love her as I began to see how she became a fairly strong and well-developed character from being weak. And well, she's a book lover and that makes her still a likeable character.\n\n\"One of the things I always try to remind myself is that everyone has scars. A lot of them even worse than mine. The only difference is that mine are visible and most people\u2019s aren\u2019t.\"\n\nThe romance is one of the book's greatest strengths. Ben and Fallon's story was poignant and heart-wrenching. All throughout the story I found myself getting scared as to what was going to happen. I got so into the book and I became really nervous because anything could happen. And wow, just when you think it can\u2019t get anymore emotional or heartbreaking, the greatest PLOT TWIST OF ALL PLOT TWISTS happened and then that's it. I was destroyed. My heart was shattered into a million different pieces. You did it all over again, Colleen Hoover!\n\nIt took four years for me to fall in love with him. It only took four pages to stop.\n\nColleen Hoover's writing style once again dumbfounded me. It never really gets old to be honest. But I guess I appreciate her more in this book. Her writing here separates November 9 from all the contemporary books I've read and even from her previous books, because the concept is unique and amazing. The whole premise and the story itself completely stole my heart, made me smile, fall in love, drown in tears, and reflect the messages behind. I LOVE NOVEMBER 9! Simply one of a kind. It's now a new favorite of mine-- one I will never forget for a very long time!\n\nShe\u2019s not the kind of girl you choose your battles for.

The writing style, characters, and story plot completely had me hooked. November 9 tore out my heart, put it back together again, and majorly messed with my emotions.To say this was an emotional roller coaster is an understatement. Fallon and Ben were perfect, scarred, and healing together but perfect. Since the moment they met they were the fresh air in each other's life. They unconsciously made the other feel like they could be best they could be, they were honest to a fault, and as much as I don't really care for Insta love stories.. this one stole my heart. They had their struggles, fears, hopes, dreams but they were each others supporter in every aspect. Even if they only met once a year, for five years. Everyone makes mistakes and sometimes the consequences stay with you your whole life and plague you with guilt, like it did for Ben. But then one day, what you expect to be the worst thing ever turns out to be exactly opposite and your world aligns itself and puts your priorities in order, that's what happened to Ben. Fallon, having gone through a traumatic incident 2 years ago, meets someone outta the blue on one of the worst anniversaries of the year and that changes everything. The middle and almost end ripped out my heart and left it in tatters... I cried way more than I'd like to admit. The ending however, righted everything. This book was amazing. And finally one of my favorite quotes has got to be this one: \"Yes, you have scars. But anyone who sees your scars before they see you doesn't deserve you. I hope you remember that and believe that.

November Nine is no exception, this story will surely take a reader through a tough mutter of emotions. Fallon and Ben\u2019s meeting comes at such a turning point in Fallon\u2019s life. Both characters are eighteen years of age and young Fallon is on her way to New York to pursue a career on Broadway.

Going back to my tough mutter scenario, things aren't smooth sailing and Colleen Hoover goes for several crushing and WTH moments.As always, I loved the flawless beauty in the writing, as well as the characters connections, and just like Confess, this book didn\u2019t need the drama or reveals for me or readers on a whole, to have slapped a 5-Star Favorite on either book. Sadly the reveal in this book only lessened the couple in my eyes.

Is the day her life changed irrevocably, is the day that changed her forever, is the day she would give anything to forget. But is also the date when she met Benton James Kessler. Ben is a college student, an aspiring novelist, a boy for whom November 9 has a certain significance. From the moment he meets Fallon, he is drawn to her and not only to her beauty, but to her personality as well. He sees the real Fallon, he doesn\u2019t see the scarred, insecure girl who tried to hide from the world. And Fallon is drawn to Ben as well. They connect with each other from the start and they agree to spend this day, November 9 with each other. Despite the strong connection between them, they part ways, Fallon moving to New York to pursue a career on Broadway, but they agree to meet on the same day at the same place for the next five years. \u201cNovember 9\u201d is that kind of a book you need to experience for yourself, so I\u2019m not going to give anything else away. Like I mentioned above this fantastic tale was original from start to finish. I loved the concept of the story. It was intriguing, unique and of course every chapter left me wanting more. I absolutely loved this beautiful, unconventional love story between these two characters. Their love story made my heart ache, but they also made it melt. It was simply wonderful, believable and beautifully told. Colleen\u2019s flawless, poetic writing made me devour this story. I lived it, I felt it, I fall in love with it. I loved these two characters. Both Fallon and Ben were flawed characters, very well portrayed in such a great way. They were endearing, have depth and they were relatable. Fallon was an easy character to like from the start. At first she was portrayed as a vulnerable young girl, but as the story progressed we get to know a different Fallon \u2013 much stronger and more confident and I have to say I loved the \u2018new Fallon\u2019. I sympathize so much with her, but I\u2019m not gonna lie, there were times when I really wanted to slap her. Needless to say I didn\u2019t agree with all her actions. Ben was a wonderful character and I fell in love with him from the very beginning. He was sweet and thoughtful, attentive and considerate, but what I loved the most about him was the way he made Fallon feels about herself. For Fallon he was like a breath of fresh air. I loved the way he talked with her, his gestures, his flirting, his sweet, sweet words.I adored their magical connection. You know why? Because I felt it with every fiber of my being. It was palpable from the beginning and I truly loved it. Fallon and Ben were wonderful together and their relationship warmed my heart. They completed each other in every single way and at times I really believed they were soul mates. The story flowed fantastically well and the time jumps never felt too much. At times it was intense, angsty, but I loved every minute of it. What I didn\u2019t like too much was the drama \u2013 unnecessary drama I could say. It was too much IMO.Overall, a wonderful read!\n\n\u201cThis is real life, and in the real world you have to bust your ass for the happy ever after\u2026 When you find love, you take it.

Almost 1 year ago when I was first add this book to my TBR shelf I was pretty excited. Because Colleen is my all time favorite author and anything she writes can\u2019t never disappoint me. Yeah, I\u2019m so sure of that and she proved to me that I\u2019m not wrong about her. And she did it again. She stole my heart once again with one of hers fictional boys\u2026As I said, I was waitin this book for months and when the time hit midnight and as soon as this book showed on my e-reader I started to read it. And almost right after 1st chapter -yeah that amazing 1st chapter- I was captivated by the story. I already gave myself to the book and I just couldn\u2019t stop reading Ben & Fallon\u2019s story. Their chemistry was perfect. I loved them so much. I just loved every single word, every good / happy / sad / bad moment in this book. And right now I'm not capable to write the summary of the book for you so pls forgive me for that and I don't want to give you spoilers etc so you just have to read this book. And I hope you feel / live those moments just like me while you're readin it.! :)Colleen, my Queen. You make me feel alive whenever I read one of yours books. You\u2019re making me feel this characters happines and sadness. It\u2019s like I\u2019m living that moment with them. Literally. That\u2019s why I love you so much. Once again thank you so much for your beautiful words and God bless you\u2026 :)Oh by the way, I have to confess one thing. Whenever I start a new CoHo book I exactly know how am gonna feel it while I\u2019 m reading the book. First I\u2019ll laugh, then I'll laugh a lot, then a couple tears will drops on my cheeks and then more laughs and then more tears, too much tears, I cannot stop that damn tears!!! And then booom! I\u2019m crying like a river. This woman always does this thing to me. But I\u2019ll forgive her for making me cry because this book (or the other books of hers) deserves every single of my tears. They're all beautiful. So fucking beautiful\u2026PS. I\u2019ll share some quotes from this book or maybe a lot of quotes. Because I have a lot of favorite moments on this book. (For example: When they were at the airport. Slow Mo scene was perfect...):) So if you\u2019re wanna read them first just before you start to read the book go ahead it's your desicion but please give this book a chance to change your life. Trust me, you won\u2019t regret it. I read this book with my sweet and gorgeous friend Ana. Maybe she didn't cry too much just like I did but she definitely got emotional a lot. :DI'll see you on our next BR honey.https://www.goodreads.com/user/show/1...--------------------------------------------\u201cIf we\u2019re going to kiss, it has to be book-worthy.\u201d\u201cAll I care about is you. Being with you every day. Seeing you every day. I\u2019m not finished falling in love with you yet.\u201d\u201cIt\u2019s easy to fall in love, Ben. The hard part comes when you want out.\u201d\u201dHis hand squeezes my waist and he eyes me hard. \u201cFallon.\u201d He says my name like it\u2019s an entire lecture in itself.\u201d\u201cI wrap my arms around her and pull her against me and when I feel her arms go around me, I do the most non-alpha thing I can possibly do. I cry like a fucking baby.\u201d\u201cYou left with my soul in your fists and my heart in your teeth, and I don\u2019t want either of them back.\u201d\u201cWhen you find love, you take it. You grab it with both hands and you do everything in your power not to let it go. You can\u2019t just walk away from it and expect it to linger until you\u2019re ready for it.\u201d\u201cIf she\u2019s not careful, I might just fall in love with her. Tonight.\u201d\u201cAnother tear falls, but this time it falls from my eye. I take a step back and I let go of her.\u201d\u201cSo whether or not you can find it in your heart to love me again, I needed to thank you for saving me. And if there is any part of you capable of forgiving me, you know where I\u2019ll be. Tonight, next year, the next, for eternity. The choice is yours.\u201d\u201cAll I want is for you to be happy. That\u2019s all I\u2019ve ever wanted. And I\u2019ll do anything to make that happen for you, even if it means helping you to forget me.\u201d\u201cI don\u2019t want to be your first, Fallon. I want to be your last.\u201d\u201cHe presses his mouth to mine and kisses me with so much emotion, I forget all the things. Everything. I forget where I am. Who I am.\u201d\u201cIf you don\u2019t show up today, I\u2019ll be there next year. And the next. Every November 9th I\u2019ll wait for you, hoping one day you\u2019ll be able to find enough forgiveness to love me again. But if that doesn\u2019t happen and you never show, I\u2019ll still be grateful to you until the day that I die. You saved me the day we met.\u201d\u201cI\u2019ve never needed to wrap my arms around someone more than I do right now, and I\u2019d give anything to have her here with me. To just be able to press my face in her hair and feel her arms around my waist, her hands on my back. There isn\u2019t a single thing in this world that could comfort me like she could, but I didn\u2019t tell her that. I couldn\u2019t.\u201d\u201cDon't stop\" I tease in a seductive voice. \" Give me more, Ben. Did you read eBooks or...\" I run my finger slowly down his chest.\"Hardbacks?\"He pulls his hands behind his head and a smug look washes over his face. \"Oh, they were hardbacks, all right. And I'm not sure if you're ready for this, but...I have my own TBR pile. You should read it, Fallon. It's huge\"\u201d\u201cI need you to know that it was always you who had my heart. And I would have never let anyone else borrow it if I knew there was a chance in hell you\u2019d ever want it back.\u201d \u201cBut the only thing that makes me sad\u2014the biggest thing\u2014is that I think about you every second of every day and I don\u2019t know how to get over you.\u201d \u201cDon\u2019t,\u201d I beg her. \u201cPlease don\u2019t get over me.\u201d\u201cYou\u2019re beautiful. Every inch of you is so beautiful.\u201d \u201cAnd I\u2019m in love with her. Like, really in love with her. Crippling, debilitating, paralyzing love. So please accept my sincerest apologies, because she\u2019s coming home with me tonight. I hope. I pray.\u201d\u201cI\u2019m not sure if sex is supposed to make you feel like you\u2019ve just lost a part of yourself to the person inside you, but that\u2019s exactly what it felt like. It felt as if the second we joined together, a tiny piece of our souls got confused and a piece of his fell into me and a piece of mine fell into him. It was by far the single most intense moment I\u2019ve ever shared with another person.\u201d\u201cHe hasn\u2019t spoken a single word to me yet, but his actions have said a million thank yous.\u201d\"When you left last year, you left with my soul in your hands and my heart in your teeth, and I knew I would never get either of them back. You can keep them, I don\u2019t really need them anymore.\"\u201cYou were just thinking dirty thoughts.\u201d\u201cWas not,\u201d I quip.\u201cFallon, we\u2019ve been dating for two hours now. I can read you like a book,and right now I do believe that book is full of erotica.\u201d\u201cFallon,\u201d he whispers, moving his lips slowly across mine. \u201cThank you for this beautiful gift.\u201d As soon as his words brush over my mouth, he covers me in a deep kiss. My whole body tenses from the burst of pain that ripples through me as he pushes inside of me, but the perfection of the way we fit together makes the pain a mere inconvenience. It\u2019s beautiful. He\u2019s beautiful. And somehow, with the way he\u2019s looking down at me, I even believe I\u2019m beautiful. He presses his mouth against my ear and whispers, \u201cNo combination of written words could ever do this moment justice.\u201d"}, {"userName": "\u25c6 Anna's \u01a6\u00aa\u03fb\u0181\u2113\u2139\u057cg$ \u25c6", "userReviewDate": "May 18, 2014", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/22324639-anna-s-g", "userReview": "I hated this book!I wanted to rate it one star last night. I was so angry. But apparently the morning is smarter than the evening. I am still pissed. The first twist in the book is stupid and unnecessary.I LOVED this book! How can I rate it one star? The story is amazing. The writing is amazing. Music to my ears. CoHo uses and combines words in such a beautiful way as if to create harmony. She always uses less to achieve more. Her messages are simple yet so complex and true. Her characters are simply beautiful, inside and out, flaws and all. She describes them in such an amazing way that even their flaws seem perfect.

Barely . . . . \nI read the first 100 pages of this book in like 17.2 seconds. That's not to say those pages were perfect. There were plenty of things that can ONLY happen in a romance novel and be okay. Some examples are the Fallon/Ben meet cute was him overhearing a father being a real dickwad to his daughter at lunch, infiltrating said lunch as her \u201cboyfriend\u201d and then spending the rest of the day together. In real life the girl would probably have both the 9 and the 1 pressed on her phone before dude even sat down and NOT be like . . . \nThere\u2019s also the \u201cconvenience\u201d aspect. Both MCs meet at 18, but are financially stable. Let me get my time machine and figure out how to make THAT happen. Again, it\u2019s a romance novel so I forgive. I also had to forgive Fallon being soooooooooooooooooo insecure, but after only a few hours with Ben being able to begin seeing herself in a whole new light. Never underestimate the power of . . . .\nAll those things aside, I thought for sure I would end up giving this 4 Stars. Why? Because out of all the tired tropes in the world, November 9 picked THE. BEST. ONE. . . . . \nOh Sweet Baby Jesus how I love the \u201cwe\u2019ll meet on this date every year\u201d storyline.

I mean #sploosh. Hoover doesn\u2019t write a lot of sexybusiness in her stories, but when she does????\nSo you\u2019re probably wondering what happened to reduce my rating so drastically.

Apparently there is a fine line between the type of fictional alpha male that makes my panties self-destruct and the non-alpha who starts as (probably a creeper if it was real life, but since it was not) the perfect dreamboat boyfriend who ends up being someone I kind of wanted to check for a vagina . . . . \nBy the end of it all I wasn\u2019t sure if I had read a book or listened to Taylor Swift songs on a loop for several hours.

As recommended by my bestie I started this on a day I knew I could start and finish in the same day. I decided to start late on Friday night so I could finish it on Saturday morning. Yeah, that didn't happen. Instead I finished in the early morning hours with no one to talk to. I am going to give you the same advice, because as I read November 9 I couldn\u2019t put it down if I tried. November 9 begins with us meeting Fallon. Fallon was a childstar before she was in a house fire that left her scarred and unable to continue acting. She is at lunch with her dad, also a former actor, and you can immediately tell they do not get along. She is bitter and hurt by his lack of regard for her. It doesn\u2019t take along to see these feelings are completely justified. I immediately felt for Fallon and wanted more for her. I think that\u2019s why I immediately fell in love with Ben.Ben is a college student and overhears the conversation between Fallon and her dad. He decides to step in and \u201crescue\u201d Fallon by pretending to be her boyfriend. In those few minutes he puts her dad in his place and makes Fallon feel more, that is all it took for this reader to fall.\n\nMy flaws are what wake me up in the morning and what keep me up every night. \n\nFallon is moving to New York that evening, but it doesn\u2019t stop Fallon and Ben from spending the day together. Ben is in school to be a writer and during their first date the discuss him writing a romance novel. It later turns into him writing their romance story. This first November 9th is when they begin fall for each other. Since they only have this one perfect day to go on they decide not to alter their lives. Together they come up with a plan to meet up again every year for five years on November 9. This will give them time to grow up and find themselves without giving up a possibility of something later.Let me tell you I love this concept. I am the kind of person who always looks back on where I was at certain times in my life. I love seeing how my life, relationships and outlooks change as I get older. Naturally, I love the idea of two strangers sharing one day every year and seeing how things develop. I also love all of the romance/book references and how Fallon gets Ben to read multiple romance novels to help him with their novel.Ben isn\u2019t perfect, but he makes Fallon feel invincible and worthy. I love that about Ben. I loved how he didn\u2019t see Fallon\u2019s scars as a ugly, but saw the beauty in her scars because they meant she was alive. Ben helped Fallon see herself different and believe in herself. I loved that.This story had me in complete knots and unable to breathe at points. The story takes off so quickly and before you know it you are halfway in and have no idea where the time went. This story takes getting lost in a book to a new level. I was in my little bubble loving life and then CoHo tore my heart out. Not literally, but it sure felt like it. That\u2019s when I started texting my bestie and basically losing it. Only to realize it was two in the morning and I was alone with my thoughts and uncontrollable emotions. I can\u2019t begin to explain how this book completely tore me up inside. Few authors deliver stories so beautifully written they feel real, therefore invoke unexplainable emotions and actions. This story completely broke my heart on so many levels. Then when I was finished I was at a loss and just wanted more.\n\n \u201cNo combination of written words could ever do this moment justice.\u201d \n\nI don\u2019t even think I can say this story is different from CoHo's other books, because I think all her stories leave me with this feeling of aw and surprise at how incredibly talented she is. I did love certain points and aspects of this story more though. I loved the reading references and how it added a lightness to the story. I love the message of loving yourself and finding beauty in more than your physical appearance. I loved the message to follow your dreams even if the circumstances change. So in a way this story is more to me. As always CoHo hit it out of the park, I highly recommend November 9.\nARC kindly provided in exchange for an honest review."}, {"userName": "Rachel Reads Ravenously", "userReviewDate": "Nov 07, 2015", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/14514998-rachel-reads-ravenously", "userReview": "It's live!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!! 5 stars! \nFirst thing I am going to say is you need to go into this book blind. I'm dead serious. I'm actually a lover of spoilers but this book is the exception. I'm not going to post any spoilers, but I'm giving you a moment right now to really think about your reading experience of this book and urging you to go in blind........Still want to read the review? Don't say I didn't warn ya. So when I saw on Facebook that many people were finding copies of November 9 early, I began to look around and found a local bookstore that had it. I left my house and drove there as soon as I could to snag a copy and get it into my grubby little hands. There's just something really exciting about a new book by Colleen Hoover.Going into this book I was a bit apprehensive, because to be honest I didn't care for the last few books Hoover has put out. \"Why would you run to read her new book?\" I can hear you all asking. Well my answer is this: I will read ANYTHING Colleen writes because her books make me FEEL. Whether it be the angst of Slammed, the emotional rollercoaster of Hopeless, or the rage that Ugly Love filled me with,  her books inspire genuine emotion from the reader,  and there is something really special in that. I also want to point out that not one Coho book is the same. I know with her that a new book will bring me a fresh and original story and not a rehash of something else. So with that being said here is my official review:  \u201cYou\u2019ll never be able to find yourself if you\u2019re lost in someone else.\u201d  November 9th is just a date right? Any day just like the other? Well, some days hold meaning and this one means a lot to two people. On this day Fallon is having lunch with her dad when she meets Ben. The two have an instant connection, but do not call it instalove. After spending the day together, they decide to meet on the same day at the same time and place for the next couple of years.  \u201cI thought I was stronger than a word, but I just discovered that having to say goodbye to you is by far the hardest thing I\u2019ve ever had to do.\u201d  To say I loved this book is an understatement. I opened this book and did nothing else until I was finished. From the first moment I needed to know what happened to these characters. I loved them and all of their flaws. Both Ben and Fallon. It's why I loved this book, because I cared what happened to them. I ended up crying! I rarely if ever cry from a book, and this story hit me hard. The book also flowed extremely well, the time jumps felt effortless and the story of the two of them entirely believable. I will say that I actually predicted a couple of key plot points (and those of you who read it know which ones) but it didn't take away from my overall enjoyment of the story. The premise reminds me of a movie my mom loves. In the book Hoover mentions Sleepless in Seattle and others, but to me this sounds like the film Same Time, Next Year (1978) with Ellen Burstyn and Alan Alda. Anyways thank you for reading my ramblings and I sincerely hope you pick up this wonderful, wonderful book. And protect your emotions when you do."}, {"userName": "Patrycja", "userReviewDate": "Mar 24, 2014", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/6852653-patrycja", "userReview": "DNF @45% I can't believe I am actaully DNFing CoHo's book.. it breaks my heart. Why? The answer is I'm just not feeling it. It's too perfect... boderline unrealistic to make me pay attention and care about the characters. The whole plot seems silly to me. How can someone truly fall in love with other person when they meet for few hours per year and then go on with their lives while basically idealising the other person in their's heads?
