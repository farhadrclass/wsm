Still, in his writings he avoided gay characters and gay themes and would occasionally utter disparaging remarks about the \u201chomosexual character,\u201d presumably to throw interviewers off the scent.This is an entertaining book, memorable for the way Maugham gleefully skewers the hypocrites and lays bare the doubleness of both sinner and writer with the scalpel of clinical observation. The major fault of the book, though, is that Maugham never seems to grasp fully the connections between hypocrisy, animal weakness, and artistic calculation--all incidences of the failure of people to achieve\u2014or society to tolerate\u2014a fully integrated human personality. Maugham expends what little sympathy he has on the socially despised sexual liberality of Rosie, the character who most clearly reflects his own hidden life. But the hypocrites like Kear and the cold, calculating writers like Driffield and Ashenden require of their creator an equal understanding, and Maugham grants them at worst mere sarcasm and at best a prominent, well-lighted place in his Exhibition of Human Contradictions.I suspect Maugham possessed neither the universal sympathy nor the abstract intelligence to perceive the connections between his characters, how each strives to reconcile personality with performance, private desires with public space. Because of this deficiency, Cakes and Ale--despite its considerable virtues--remains a precariously balanced construction of satire and sympathy, and therefore falls somewhat short of being a great book."}, {"userName": "Kim", "userReviewDate": "Feb 19, 2014", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/4542979-kim", "userReview": "Why oh why have I not read anything by Maugham before? Not having done so is my loss, and one which I must continue to remedy without delay. I decided to read one of Maugham's novels because I knew from Gordon Bowker's biography of George Orwell that Orwell was a great admirer of his writing. This particular novel suggested itself because of its subject (a satire on literary London in the early 20th century) and because it's apparently the novel for which Maugham himself most wanted to be remembered. Maugham's crystal clear prose and his wry, ironic wit made the audiobook version of this novel an absolute joy to listen to. It has some great characters and an interesting structure which moves back and forward in time. Parts of it - particularly at the beginning - were laugh-out-loud funny. I now understand why Orwell thought so highly of Maugham. It's wonderful to have another prolific writer to explore in depth."}, {"userName": "Cheryl", "userReviewDate": "May 20, 2017", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/11255849-cheryl", "userReview": "[until later...

Maugham is such an interesting writer and although he did not think himself a great writer, I believe he does have his moments of greatness. I loved  Of Human Bondage and this one again uses material from his own life yet again \u2013 particularly stuff to do with his childhood spent with his vicar uncle and his aunt in the country. The book starts off with a bit of a pattern to it. The book is written in first person singular \u2013 we will talk a bit more about that later \u2013 and the I in the piece begins by mentioning that he has been invited to have a chat with an old \u2018friend\u2019 and fellow writer. There then follows a digression on the nature of friendships with writers (a not terribly kind discussion). There is then the meeting itself where it becomes fairly clear that this writer is interested in what the I in the book knows about another writer who has fairly recently died. The I in the book had grown up in a village where the dead writer had lived part of his early life and then went back to in his final years. However, about the only thing the I can remember is that the dead writer had taught him how to ride a bicycle. The other writer says the dead writer\u2019s first wife was a bit common and not well liked \u2013 however, this is definitely not how the I in the book remembers her.They part, with the other writer less than happy with the outcome of their chat, and this sets the I in the novel thinking back to his childhood and in particular his curious relationship with the dead novelist and his wife \u2013 which turns out to be much more involved than he had admitted to the other writer.This pattern is then repeated. I won\u2019t tell you the whole story, but the point is that up until the point in the story that I have told you about Rosie, the wife of the dead novelist, is only a minor character. That doesn\u2019t last.I find jealousy, particularly sexual jealousy, to be a fascinating theme in novels. There was a time when I could be painfully jealous \u2013 but over the years I have decided that jealousy is a pointless and stupid emotion. All the same, it is a beast we are best not to trifle with. If we can learn nothing from Othello, we ought to be able to learn at least that. This is not your usual cautionary tale about jealousy though. In fact, this is nothing like your usual tale about anything.I don\u2019t want to give too much away about this book, as part of the joy of it really is in finding out what was going to happen next \u2013 all the same, it must have been quite a shocking book when it first came out. The idea that perhaps women might actually even enjoy sex may have been deeply shocking, in fact, probably is deeply shocking to some people. At least, people both at the time and now are and were prepared to pretend that such an idea was deeply shocking.Cakes and Ale, the title, comes from a line in Twelfth Night by Sir Toby Belch, \u201cDost thou think, because thou art virtuous, there shall be no more cakes and ale?\u201d And this is the central tension that drives the novel; a novel of a society coming out of Victorian sensibilities and trying to come to terms with a woman who clearly does not fit comfortably into those particularly tight corsets This was a lovely book, one I liked very much. There are many quotable quotes (and I do like a book with lots of quotable quotes). But the best thing about it was that it never seemed to have to try too hard. Like I said, it was dealing with a theme that would have been quite controversial in 1930 and it did so in a clear, up front and interesting way.The back cover of the edition I have (printed in 1966, the year of Maugham\u2019s death) says this is his gayest (meaning most cheerful) novel. All I can say is that his other novels must be pretty depressing \u2013 this one isn\u2019t really all that depressing, but it is hardly a laugh-fest, except when he is being nasty about his fellow writers, of course, or Americans, or prudes. The saddest character in the novel, I think, is the second wife, the nurse and assurer of the dead novelist\u2019s ongoing reputation (posterity may be a fickle mistress, but a mistress of a dead artist is forever faithful). The scene in which the I writer runs his finger along the spine of the books in the dead writer\u2019s library to see how much dust is there and finds none (implying they have been recently purchased for appearance sake) \u2013 to which he ironically makes a mental note that the housekeeper must be very efficient is almost painful to read.Now, in chapter 16 of this book there is a wonderful discussion of the benefits and disadvantages of writing a book in the first person singular \u2013 in fact, this occurs at just about the time when the main character would have his personal pronoun at just about its most perpendicular \u2013 if that isn\u2019t being too crude. There is a lovely bit where he makes fun of books on how to write novels, \u2018On his advice I read The Craft of Fiction by Mr Percy Lubbock, from which I learned that the only way to write novels was like Henry James; after that I read Aspects of the Novel by Mr E. M. Forster, from which I learned that the only way to write novels was like Mr E.M. Forster; then I read  by Mr Edwin Muir, from which I learned nothing at all.\u2019In this bit of the novel he says something which I think is terribly interesting and terribly important about the decision to write a novel in first person (i.e. with lots of \u2018I\u2019s) or to decide to write it in omniscient narration (where the writer has privileged access to the inner workings of the minds of everyone in the novel).\u201cSometimes the novelist feels himself like God and is prepared to tell you everything about his characters; sometimes, however, he does not; and then he tells you not everything that is to be known about them but the little he knows himself; and since as we grow older we feel ourselves less and less like God I should not be surprised to learn that with advancing years the novelist grows less and less inclined to describe more than his own experience had given him. The first person singular is a very useful device for this limited purpose.\u201dAnd if I didn\u2019t love him before, it was impossible not to love him after his saying that. I enjoyed this book very much. Not as much as  Of Human Bondage, but enough \u2013 more than enough."}, {"userName": "Werner", "userReviewDate": "Jul 09, 2015", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/903390-werner", "userReview": "This particular book was adopted as a common read in one of my Goodreads groups, which is how I came to read it (previously, I'd actually never heard of it). My previous exposure to Maugham's work was only through a couple of his short stories. As an introduction to his long fiction, this novella was perhaps not as successful as might have been wished; I didn't rate it as highly as a couple of my Goodreads friends in the group did.The Goodreads description for the book is reasonably accurate, though would-be biographer Kear doesn't suddenly \"discover\" the existence of his subject's spectacularly unfaithful first wife Rosie; he's known about her all along --and knows she's going to be a difficult \"skeleton in the cupboard\" to deal with in writing the kind of sanitized biography he wants to write. But it doesn't deal with the role of Willie Ashenden, Kear's fellow novelist, as narrator and viewpoint character, and keeper of voluminous (and scandalous) Driffield family secrets that are strategically disclosed to the reader as the book progresses. Ashenden (who is also the protagonist of the earlier Maugham novel Ashenden, or the British Agent) is a character clearly modeled on the author himself; they share a substantial body of biographical details, and Maugham was known as \"Willie\" to his friends. As such, Ashenden serves as the mouthpiece for Maugham's own viewpoints and lectures on matters related and unrelated to the plot.Part of Maugham's agenda in writing this work, as the description makes clear, is to deliver a devastating satire on the self-contained, status-obsessed little world of the ca. 1930 British literary scene, which still packs a bite, and applies wherever snobbery, vanity and self-aggrandizement rules the realm of letters (which is to say, usually). Another target of his satire is the class snobbery of his Victorian and Edwardian boyhood and youth: a mindset in which people's personal worth is determined solely by what their parents did for a living, with manual labor being viewed as the most absolutely demeaning thing a human being can do, and in which this status dictates who's good enough to associate with, what you can do and be with your life, even which door of a house you're fit to knock on. This viewpoint was stronger in England than in America; but it's not wholly dead in either country, even today. Maugham does a commendable job at calling this kind of prejudice out and exposing it for ridicule.Ultimately, though, his main message here is of a piece with that of some other early 20th-century writers: advocacy for liberation from moral ideals of chastity and marital fidelity, which are seen as hopelessly antiquated, repressive structures that choke everything healthy, natural, free, and generally warm and fuzzy (not to mention hip and trendy). The main carrier for this particular cargo is Rosie's character, which is carefully sketched as noble, warm, kind, generous, all-around adorable --and \"innocently\" promiscous, with Ashenden's narration used to stack the deck and direct the reader's impressions. (Rosie's comment at one point, \"Enjoy yourself while you have the chance, I say; we shall all be dead in a hundred years and what will anything matter then? Let's have a good time while we can,\" is a perfect capsule statement of the philosophy of existential meaninglessness and absolute hedonism; and if Rosie isn't educated enough to think of it in those terms, Maugham definitely was.)In the 85 years since this was written, of course, the Western world has changed epochally. Maugham's view is now accepted orthodoxy for the ruling political and socio-economic elites and the media, and the popular masses that uncritically accept it, exemplified by the abolition of legally-binding marriage in the 1960s. For more critical observers, though, who consider the current explosion of impoverished female-headed households and the resulting train of social pathologies this has fostered in the unmoored generations raised in these, the epidemics of AIDS and other STDs, the skyrocketing of out-of-wedlock childbirths to rates previously unprecedented in human history, the development of the flesh trade and pornography into worldwide billion dollar growth industries with powerful political influence, and the creation of a culture in which one third of all women can expect to be sexually assaulted or abused in their lifetime, it is a defensible conclusion that the message has not worn well with time.The novel is a quick read, with an unintimidating style, and Maugham's skill at characterization is much in evidence (though I personally don't find Rosie as unqualifiedly winsome as some readers do). But Maugham's frequent asides of obiter dicta on various abstractions or side subjects tend to be boring, off-beam, and as generally irritating in a first-person narrator as they sometimes were in 19th-century third person narrators (think, Thackeray at his worst). And the discussion late in the book over whether or not Rosie is a \"white nigger,\" because of her \"thick lips and broad nose\" is likely to offend any reader who has enlightened racial sensibilities."}, {"userName": "Chrissie", "userReviewDate": "Dec 03, 2017", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/632247-chrissie", "userReview": "I like this a lot, so four stars is what I shall give it. There is not one measly thing I feel I need to grumble about!I have narrowed down what I like about the book to three things. These are summarized in the three following paragraphs.Humor: the book is a satire criticizing the social snobbery of the literary world and high society in London at the turn of the 20th century. The setting is London and Blackstable, Kent, a fictitious town modeled on Whitstable, on the north coast of Kent in southeastern England, near Canterbury. Satirical irony is fused into almost every line at the start. Then, as the story line picks up, your attention shifts to that. The humor remains throughout, but with less prominence because the plot has captured your interest. Satire comes in many forms. Here, first you think about what is said and then you laugh when you realize what is implied and what is actually being said. The humor is amusing, not nasty.You enter the story at a tilt. Who is the story really about? It is not whom you guess at the start. You make another guess, and that proves wrong too. The reader is circling around and getting deeper to the core. Along the way, you are gradually gathering information. John Donne's line \"No man is an island,\" aptly fits. How the story is approached is what I am praising and what this says about interactions between people.What lies under the surface of the characters' behavior ? This is the core of the novel. You come to know whom the story is really about and how one person's life is rolled up in another's. Isn\u2019t it often that we make judgments about one another without adequate understanding?! You look at a person, make a judgment from what you see, but that judgment can be completely off mark! To understand another properly one must go below the surface, beneath what is visible.Maugham has a way with words. He captures the essence of his characters. This is achieved through how he draws them, through what they say, what they wear, what they do and how they interact with each other. And often through humor. The audiobook is extremely well narrated by James Saxon. I have given the narration five stars. It is to his credit that I laughed rather than becoming annoyed in the high society of London. He captures that world perfectly, without getting me annoyed, instead making me laugh. You don\u2019t think that the story is being told to you; you just listen and easily follow the events, the dialogs and chuckle at the humor.On closing the book, I sat back and thought about the title. Cakes and ale are the emblems of the good life in the moral of the fable attributed to Aesop's, \u201cThe Town Mouse and the Country Mouse\u201d: Better beans and bacon in peace, than cakes and ale in fear.\u201d (Source Wiki.)

Someday there'd be bios, he knew, and he wanted control, if possible, of the content. 20 years earlier he pondered his literary status and the problems of bio writing in this semi-satire, which tweaks the idea of A Literary Reputation. Hadnt Dickens, James, Samuel Johnson and Hardy burnt papers that might stain their Fame? Who has it, who doesn't and how some play the promotion game -- literary teas, salons, At Homes, courting critics. MOM offers witty and deadly examples of the upward Fame Game. MOM also had something else in mind. His story is wrapped around a pushy, very popular novelist (Alroy Kear) who preens his careerism as he preps a bio of a lauded Victorian novelist (Edward Driffield) based on Thomas Hardy, recently deceased. MOM writes with his usual adroitness, moving easily from present to past. You will be impressed by his technical dexterity. The Kear character is based on Hugh Walpole (does anyone read him today?), and MOMs real aim was to humiliate him for being a success. Jealousy, you know. A gadabout charmer, Walpole was liked by many, a mentor to many and with a good nature. MOM, a cut above him as a novelist, couldnt bear Walpole's personal and professional likeability. Though MOM (smugly, perhaps) calls this a favorite novel of his, it isnt that good when all is said and done. The central woman named Rosie, Driffield's first wife, has won pundit praise for \"delicious\" characterization. But she's not as memorable as Julia Lambert in MOMs \"Theatre,\" a terrific backstage comedy. Rosie, MOM let it be known -- or, flaunted? -- was based on his first, great love, actress Sue Jones who rejected his offer for marriage in 1914. So next came Syrie and Gerald Haxton. A good sport, Sue liked sex and slept around; she also had a warm,  maternal  personality.In this story, Rosie Driffield sleeps around right and left, and her husband doesnt seem to know or care. It just doesnt make any difference. This fanciful \"plotting\" makes no sense. The real Rosie didnt have a husband. The fictional Rosie does. MOM is blinkered. Other than Rosie's busy sex life we know v little about her or why she later leaves her getting-famous husband. MOM doesnt try to provide an answer. Driffield himself is a mere sketch : he's at his newspaper editing or in his sanctum writing madly, gladly away. I think MOMs stuffed peppers are unbelievable here because he simply didnt care. He wanted to sound off on Fame and he just wanted to insult Walpole who'd been a friend for some years. Virginia Woolf chortled. \"Poor Hugh,\" she wrote her sister in 1930, \"it was a clever piece of torture....\" With customary precision, MOM inserts himself into the saga as a young doctor who also beds the first Mrs Driffield. Her body \"was made for the act of love.\" O Susie ! \"The only color was the rosy pink of the hard nipples.\" And, then, he bursts into tears.

The main character, Ashenden, is connected through space and time with the social world of an ascending author. At first I thought the novel only was a vehicle used by Maugham to criticize the literary world, i.e. the path to fame, who knows who, etc, but I was pleasantly surprised as the full spectrum of the novel developed. Maugham subtly weaved layers of circumstances between the different characters while simultaneously combining the present with vivid and engaging recollections from boyhood. It became a journey through memory with all its different facets from happiness to sorrow. I did get the feeling that Maugham shifted in his moods quite a bit while writing this novel. Sometimes he was extremely sarcastic (and funny) throwing literary barbs everywhere. At other times he is very nostalgic and sweet bringing forward the realms of memory and love with great poetic gusto. The novel truly shines in those chapters. It is a marvelous blend of life sparkling among these pages. It is lovely and will be reread. The novel has also sparked my interest in exploring additional works by Maugham.

W. Somerset Maugham has always remained one of my favourite authors and re-reading this was a delight. It features a returning character; the narrator being William \u2018Willie\u2019 Ashenden. Much of this novel is autobiographical and, indeed, Maugham himself always said it was his favourite. Ashenden is a novelist, who knew the great \u2018man of letters,\u2019 Edward Driffield as a young man. Driffield has recently died, leaving his widow, and former nurse, looking for a biographer to help present the vision of his life that she approves of. She asks Alroy Kear to write Driffield\u2019s life and he, in turn, asks for Ashenden\u2019s help. Ashenden knew Driffield well, and also his first wife, Rosie. Rosie is something of an embarrassment in terms of the biography \u2013 a former barmaid, she was notoriously unfaithful and Driffield\u2019s widow is keen to play down her role.This is very much a satire of literary London and you sense that Maugham is having a great deal of fun in writing this. He is keen to point out literary trends; gleefully pointing out that nobody remembers many of the people he met at literary soirees at the time. It is said that Edward Driffield was based on Thomas Hardy, while Alroy Kear, who approaches Ashenden for his reminiscences, is based upon Hugh Walpole. It was later suggested that this novel ruined Walpole\u2019s literary reputation and, indeed, the remaining years of his life, although Maugham refused to acknowledge the suggested connections between the above mentioned authors and his characters. He certainly takes a side swipe at Evelyn Waugh (another favourite author of mine) and is at his best when sniping at the literary world and also laughing at himself as a young, priggish and snobbish youth.Rosie, it is obvious, is not the embarrassment that Driffield\u2019s widow wants her to be. As Ashenden recalls his life and his relationship with Driffield, it is Rosie who really comes to life on the page. Her character, charm, beauty and humour which draws everyone around her; like moths to a flame. This is a wonderful book and I am not surprised that Maugham wanted to be remembered for it.

I loved how the inflections of class, dry wit, and observations encompassed the plot. This caused me to slow my reading, enjoy the story, and savor Maugham's words. For example: \"Beauty is that which satisfies the aesthetic instinct. But who wants to be satisfied? It is only to the dullard that enough is as good as a feast. Let us face it: beauty is a bit of a bore.\" Or \"Beauty is perfect, and perfection (such is human nature) holds our attention but for a little while\". I am left with the thought that this will be the sort of book that will change for me each time I read it. I think I will find a new phrase that strikes me with each reading of the book. For this first time, I was struck by the beauty phrases which left me with a bit to think about. I was pleasantly surprised to have such a reaction to a book.  What is it about: William Ashenden narrates the book in the first person singular. Initially a medical student, Ashenden takes the reader through the scenes with surgical matter of factness that fractures at times when his literary nature rears its head. He tells a meandering tale that always returns to its point; but many of the gems in this book can be found in the meanderings. An old writer friend, Alroy Kear (who Maugham was asked several times by a few indignant authors in his circle if the character was based on them) visits Ashenden with a request for information. Information related to the life of esteemed, recently deceased, fellow author, Edward Driffield. Ashenden spent his childhood, adolescence, and early adulthood in the company of Driffield and his first wife, barmaid Rosie. (As a side note, Maugham wrote in January 1950, that he had wanted to base a book on a woman he met in his youth. One who had \"grave and maddening faults, but she was beautiful and honest\" and so he created Cakes and Ale to give life to this woman in its pages.) Ashenden chafes at revealing too much into the personal lives of the couple who opened his eyes to class distinctions, broke some of those distinctions, befriended him, cultured him, nurtured him, and ultimately guided him a few of his life choices. Yet with cool, clinical precision, Ashenden in his narrative to the reader does not hold back on the faults of the couple as well. He travels with Kear to meet the second Mrs Driffield and engages in a conversations related to her deceased husband. As you follow Ashenden's story from boyhood to adulthood; the Driffields remain a part of his life and have an influence that eventually even Ashenden has to acknowledge.  The themes of class distinction, rural English town life, the beginning of a moral revolution of womanhood, were all prevalent in this book. I don't want to discuss too much without giving away the intricacies of the plot what made it so enjoyable to discover as you turn the pages. I was enthralled seeing the world of the British classes through the youthful eyes of young Willie and as a bystander watched his rose color glasses fade away with the accumulation of life experiences and maturity. It was a fascinating read and I will definitely be rereading this one."}, {"userName": "Gina", "userReviewDate": "Nov 19, 2008", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/340255-gina", "userReview": "Maugham is the perfect summer holiday read.

The Americans, who are the most efficient people on earth, have carried this device to such a height of perfection and have invented so wide a range of pithy and hackneyed phrases that they can carry on an amusing and animated conversation without giving a moment's reflection to what they are saying and so leave their minds free to consider the more important matters of big business and fornication.\"Maugham makes poetry of insults!

Ashenden known Roy well enough to know that Roy must want something. Roy is a successful author while Ashenden's own books have largely been overlooked by the critics and forgotten by the public, but that's all right with him. He never desired fame, unlike the bestselling Roy. When Ashenden finally discovers what it is Roy wants, he finds he has a dilemma. Roy Kear has been asked by the widow of the famous author Edward Driffield to write a biography of Driffield. The problem is not a lot is publicly known about Driffield's first wife and he wrote some of his best books during that time. The problem is that what Ashenden known about the lovely, vivacious Rosie Driffield doesn't fit the public image Mrs. Driffield No. 2 has worked hard to carefully cultivate for her famous husband. Under her care he transformed from something quite bohemian and lower class to a proper gentleman. In between debates about literature, Ashenden remembers his childhood in a small seaside English village. As the nephew of the local vicar, young Willie wasn't supposed to associate with the cottage-born Edward Driffield and his wife Rosie, a former barkeep. The local women gossip that Rosie is no better than she should be, but Willie finds her charming and friendly and Edward is kind enough to cultivate a friendship with a schoolboy. Their friendship means a lot to the lonely boy and now, over 30 years later, he can never forget their friendship.I skipped a lot of the literary criticisms. I didn't find the debates at all interesting. I suppose it was supposed to be funny but I found that the author was included a lot of the same techniques he was criticising. There didn't seem to be a lot of focus in this novel. I understood the social satire and found it kind of funny but not all that witty. The narrative story about the Driffields is more interesting but in parts cliched. I was expecting something a little different and more funny.  Willie is a frightful snob as the vicar's nephew. He tries to be snotty but learns to unbend as he gets older. His adult voice is dry and boring. He's gone back to being haughty. His personality doesn't really come through. He tells the story in a detached sort of way and I kept waiting for the plot to begin. When there was a plot, it was a bit predictable. Roy Kear is an obvious toad eater. He's an obvious snob but in a different way than young Willie. A bit younger than Ashenden, he doesn't understand or chooses to ignore the Victorian values of the time when Driffield started writing. He chooses to believe only the carefully cultivated narrative of Mrs. Driffield. He's not a likeable character and I don't think he was supposed to be. He didn't really come alive for me and there wasn't really any finale to his plot. Edward Driffield exists in the background of the narrative. We don't really know anything about him personally. All we know is what we're told from the narrator and from everyone who knew him. He sounds like a colorful character but since he's hardly ever active in a scene, he's hard to really know. I think that's the point of the story. Who was the real Edward Driffield?Rosie is the most colorful character in the story, yet I didn't like her much. I kind of agreed with the Victorian sentiment though not with their treatment of her. I think Ashenden tries too hard to defend her and justify her actions. I didn't get the same impression of her, especially at the end of the book. I found her more calculating than she was supposed to be and I wasn't sympathetic to her at all. I'm not really into 20th century literature so I guess I didn't really appreciate this novel enough.

Maugham \u00e8 un orologiaio, e questo \"Il fantasma nell'armadio\" (o \"Lo scheletro nell'armadio\", a seconda della traduzione) ne \u00e8 un ottimo esempio: se le sue storie sono, ad un primo impatto, semplicissime, \u00e8 solamente perch\u00e9 per un autore come Maugham \u00e8 un gioco da ragazzi riuscire a raccontarcele. Ma mai come in questo libro riesce a stupire pagina dopo pagina: si parte da un evento insignificante e si finisce, un colpo di scena alla volta, ad assistere ad una storia dai risvolti quasi incredibili.Trama: la morte di un anziano e famoso scrittore, fra i pi\u00f9 grandi del suo periodo e riconosciuto come un letterato inimitabile, \u00e8 l'occasione per la vedova di raccogliere il materiale rimasto e farne una biografia che ne racconti tutti gli aspetti. Incaricato un giovane scrittore di aiutarla, i due trovano in un terzo scrittore \u2014 il narratore \u2014 uno dei pochi ad averlo conosciuto in giovent\u00f9. Per quest'ultimo \u00e8 l'occasione di ripensare proprio alla sua infanzia e al primo incontro con questo famoso scrittore, quando era ancora solo un insignificante marinaio con la passione per la scrittura e i suoi capolavori erano ben al di l\u00e0 da divenire, ma soprattutto ricordarsi della prima moglie di lui. \u00c8 questo misterioso personaggio, di cui negli anni si \u00e8 perso quasi il ricordo, a giocare un ruolo principale nella storia di Maugham e nella storia del famoso scrittore stesso: proveniente da una piccola cittadina, essa viene ricordata come una poco di buono, ma soprattutto per essere tutto ad un tratto fuggita, abbandonando il marito tanto alla sua disperazione quanto al suo successo come scrittore.Di pagina in pagina il narratore, sempre in prima persona, svela pian piano tutta la storia: da un inizio in cui, furbescamente, al lettore viene fatto pensare che non ci sia niente dietro questa vicenda, ci troviamo in breve alle prese con tanti colpi di scena. Maugham non scriveva gialli, ma la sua capacit\u00e0 di mostrare man mano al lettore le sue carte \u00e8 un qualcosa che in questo tipo di narrativa non sempre \u00e8 riscontrabile. Se a questo uniamo un gusto per l'ironia e la voglia di raccontare i vizi pi\u00f9 segreti degli uomini (quando nel 1930 questo libro venne pubblicato provoc\u00f2 enorme scandalo per il suo essere tanto libertino), il risultato \u00e8 un quadro perfetto, o un orologio preciso in tutti i suoi ingranaggi."}, {"userName": "Lisa", "userReviewDate": "Aug 08, 2009", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/306805-lisa", "userReview": "The last sentence on the back of the Penguin Classic jacket cover of this book reads, \"A controversial novel when it was published, Cakes and Ale brings us a heroine so sensual and modern that she's still able to raise an eyebrow today.\" Unfortunately, the reader doesn't get to the sensual, controversial part of the novel until over 200 pages into it. The rest of the book is about a writer writing in England. It is well done but I would only recommend it to those, like myself, who are Anglophiles interested in the art of writing. This gives the book a rather small audience, I would imagine. Rosie, the afore mentioned \"modern\" heroin doesn't really strike me as terribly modern in the author's portrayal of her. She is sexual to the point of being something of a nymphomaniac but the narrator makes a point to say that this is so merely because she is simple and sensual in the most earthy kind of way. She is not strong willed, educated and independent as a modern woman would be expected to be, she's sweet and loving and always up for a role in the hay. She is said to walk with, \"The firm tread of the country woman who likes to feel the good earth under her feet.\" If one must place her in any particular time I would be more inclined to call her Edenic than modern. She is old fashion in the sense that she exhibits human urges which predate social standards and the book (within the book) most expressly written about Rosie, by her author husband, The Cup of Life, is clearly about the death of innocence but it's also about the writer's exploitation of it. Cakes and Ale is too concerned with writers and the act of writing for Rosie's role as muse to be overlooked. She is muse to two writers and a painter. Rosie is the essence of nature, the rest is spun around her like a work of fiction."}, {"userName": "Ray Campbell", "userReviewDate": "Jul 10, 2012", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/7566522-ray-campbell", "userReview": "I have read lots of books I've loved, but few have had the influence \"The Razor's Edge\" has had on me. W. Somerset Maugham really struck me and I've returned to Larry Darrell a half dozen times - like an old friend. I've also enjoyed Maugham's short stories and the movie adaptation of The Painted Veil. So, his work is always on my list of books to read. I picked up \"Of Human Bondage\" and \"Cakes and Ale\". \"Cakes and Ale\" being a shorter book, I thought I'd knock it out before beginning the larger work.I liked the style. \"Cakes and Ale\" begins with a series of luncheons and character sketches which were delightful, but lacked any clear purpose. I am embarrassed to admit that at about halfway I searched and read reviews of the book that explained that it was a send up of some of the authors and the London scene of the early twentieth century. In other words, he was making fun of the snobbery of London's literary community. Ultimately the charm of the book is in the characters Maugham creates. There is no deeper meaning or message. Maugham thinks snobbery is silly, but he takes great joy in creating rather endearing though thoroughly self absorbed snobs and poking fun at them. Near the mid point, a love story begins. The narrator, William Ashenden, is re-united with Rosie Driffield, a woman from his hometown who has moved to London and married. After 150 pages of luncheons and snobbery, a fun, funny affair held my interest and the second half of the book ended up being quite satisfying. So, this was a slice of life, tongue in cheek romp through literary London of the 20s.

Interestingly, from those stories, novels by Maugham I had read, I had never read any romantic part till I read this one dealing with his surprisingly brief affairs with Rosie, a lady of rare character.I encountered a few problems and I would appreciate your solutions.1. I couldn\u2019t find the meaning of \u2018limned\u2019. The sentences: We know of course that women are habitually constipated, but to represent them in fiction as being altogether devoid of a back passage seems to me really an excess of chivalry. I am surprised that they care to see themselves thus limned. (p. 91) I guess it should be \u2018limbed\u2019.2. Another is \u2018shot the moon\u2019. The sentence: \u2018You know that shortly after this he shot the moon. He let everybody in.\u2019 (p. 102) 3. A French sentence: V\u00e9nus toute enti\u00e8re \u00e0 sa proie attach\u00e9e!

The story is about Rosie Driffield, the sexually-liberated first wife of the British author, Edward Driffield. What made this novel controversial during its first publication in 1930, was that people said that the character of Edward Driffield is actually the novelist Thomas Hardy (Far From the Madding Crowd, Tess of the d'Ubervilles, Jude the Obscure, etc). So what? Answer: Rosie Driffield had an affair with the narrator in the story, William Ashenden who if you equate should be William Somerset Maugham himself! And if you are a fan of Maugham, you know that most of his novels are semi-autobiographical.Also the beautiful captivating prose, vivid description of the Victorian England and the crisp narrative, this novel made me an instant Maugham fan myself and I look forward to reading his other books.Some of my favorite lines:\n\"I had read too many novels and had learnt too much at school not to know a good deal about love, but I thought it was a matter that only concerned young people. I could not conceive that a man with a beard, who had sons as old as I, could have any feelings of that sort. I thought when you married all that was finished.

This is a book where there are essentially two plots woven together in time and space, connected by a narrator in the present who is remembering the past. Roy Kear, a respected, dull, but socially ambitious writer has been asked to write a biography of Edward Driffield, a sainted and hallowed, recently deceased English writer who critics have placed reverentially with awe into the canon. Amy Driffield, the second wife, much younger and very respectable wants Kear to write the biography, but they have a small problem - the first Mrs. Driffield, who abruptly vanishes at the peak of Driffield's career. Enter William Ashenden, a sort of friend of Kear's who knew Edward and Rosie (the first Mrs.) Driffield back in the day -- when Edward was an up-and-coming writer and Rosie was a sensuous and sexually free muse for her husband. Willie relates the story of the Driffield's rise and fall. There's much to say about art and literature; there's also much to say about \"cakes and ale\" and who gets to decide what's morally acceptable or not.
