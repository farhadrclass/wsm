Boy, was I wrong. This is one of those rare books that it not only not as good as the movie, but it was much, much worse. I am actually not even sure how they made such a great film from such a pathetic read. The characters were not very likable at the beginning, and by the end, I was glad to see one of them die, just so it would end. The main character, Cee Cee is just plain trashy, but she somehow becomes the hero of the story. Her best friend Bertie is whiney and pathetic, and I found myself often wanting to slap her. The best thing you can do with this book is take it to a beach, and leave it there."}, {"userName": "Ladyslott", "userReviewDate": "Mar 22, 2010", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/3475302-ladyslott", "userReview": "Having seen the movie Beaches more times than I can count, I was looking forward to the book. I am therefore sorry to say that I didn\u2019t like it that much. The basic story stays the same: Cee Cee Bloom and Bertie White (Hillary in the movie) form an unlikely friendship when they are 10 and & 7 years old (respectively). Through many years and personal hardships they remain friends, until a tragic illness brings them together.What didn\u2019t I like about this book? Cee Cee Bloom is not a very nice person in this book, and I found it hard to really care for her. In the movie Bette Midler gives her a clear vulnerability that wasn\u2019t apparent in the book. It also seemed to me that the author had Bette specifically in mind while writing the story, as if it were already a screenplay in her head. The character of Bertie was whiny and sad. I wanted more than once to say: Come on woman get on with your life!!, but it never seemed to happen. The clich\u00e9d fate of one of the male characters was kind of \u2018been there done that\u2019 and I expected more from the author.Nevertheless, because of fond movie memories the book scored extra points, that\u2019s why it gets a high 3***."}, {"userName": "Rachel", "userReviewDate": "Oct 21, 2009", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/2838671-rachel", "userReview": "loved it as much as i love the film. beautiful story about a beautiful friendship and what you'd do for the friend you love most; that has become your family."}, {"userName": "Jinky", "userReviewDate": "Jan 19, 2011", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/4013741-jinky", "userReview": "**Contains adult language and content**(book I read from actually has a different bookcover image, but I couldn't find it, original '85 hardcover edition, and honestly I like this paperback cover better)\"1951. They meet as children under the boardwalk in Atlantic City. Cee Cee Bloom, with a Brillo pad of red hair, a knock-out voice and a sparkle that demands attention, is performing in a kiddie show. Bertie White is from a conventional family with traditional values, but she finds herself captivated by the glitter of Cee Cee's world. And Cee Cee in turn depends on Bertie's enthusiastic support and open-hearted affection. From that first special day on the beach, they enliven each other's existence. As pen pals, they confide to each other the growing excitement and frustration they experience in their awakening womanhood. And as they meet through the years, they strengthen the friendship that will last them the rest of their lives. Cee Cee soars to stardom in Hollywood and on Broadway, while Bertie settles into marriage to a successful attorney, who finds Bertie's relationship with the outrageous Cee Cee unsuitable. But neither of these women can relinquish her special tie--a bond forged in their youth and destined to endure the hidden jealousies, the glare of celebrity, the explosive misunderstandings, the tolls exacted by drugs and tragedy, the shock of divorce and death, the unsparing demands when a loved one is in need. And the tears and laughter of two friends who finally make their peace through a little girl's love.\" (original book's synopsis)At the library a few days ago, this title (Beaches) came to me... thinking of the movie. I figured maybe it was inspired from a book so I checked the catalog and sure enough there's a book! I was excited because I love love love the movie! Bette Midler was great in it and her \"Wind Beneath My Wings\" song is just beautiful. I figured it would be a fun read. I was giddy at first, totally picturing the scene when Cee Cee and Bertie first met. I had forgotten the bold language Cee Cee had even at a young age. It called for it in her character though, but it progressively got too crass for my taste. Bette Midler's take on it was perfect though and often throughout the book I'd picture her sassy attitude and get a smile. Anyway, Bertie's character is a bit different in the book as well. Barbara Hershey, who played her in the movie, portrayed a demure and steady Bertie. In the book, Bertie was too passive and easily shaken (except in the end). Overall, I had high expectation coming into this book with having enjoyed the movie version under my belt. I wasn't completely disappointed because the book did have the crust of the storyline I enjoyed in the film version. I just happen to like the film's take on it much better... much more heartwarming.Best friends are awesome! Through thick and thin Bertie and Cee Cee were there for each other. It took me back to days with a couple of my BFFs. In our case we (the Three Musketeers) met in 7th grade. We also had a falling out but fortunately we were able to resolve it and continue to be BFFs to this day. Such bond in friendship was what I enjoyed most in this story. Every girl needs a homegirl(s) by her side. There's nothing like having friends who will stand by you. Thankful that we don't have the same ending as Bertie and Cee Cee. ~Love you forever Peb and Glo!!Book version: rating =3Movie version: rating =5 (but I suppose I'm bias because again, I love love love the movie) :)***Find this review and more at Jinky is Reading"}, {"userName": "Heather", "userReviewDate": "Jun 20, 2008", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/675793-heather", "userReview": "I really enjoyed this book. The relationship between the two women was real; it wasn't pretty, simple, or common. It was deep, complicated, and that made the book even better. There were parts which I felt extreme disappointment; but not because the book was bad or so-so, but because I wanted more for both women. This book really kept going and made me feel a lot for the characters, which I haven't had in awhile."}, {"userName": "Karen", "userReviewDate": "Mar 30, 2011", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/1874807-karen", "userReview": "Beaches is probably my all time favorite friendship movie. I was so looking forward to reading this book to learn more about the characters, but it was not good. I did not like the Bertie character at all. Way too week and the Cee Cee character was too filthy mouth. This book was more about sex and such strong language more so than the friendship that was the basis of the movie."}, {"userName": "Rebecca McNutt", "userReviewDate": "May 23, 2015", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/36977686-rebecca-mcnutt", "userReview": "Excellent novel of friendship, filled with nostalgia and vibrant imagery.

Ever! For those who have not read, or watched the movie, the book is set between 1951 and 1983. It follows a relationship between two very different girls: Cee Cee Bloom, a loud mouth/potty mouthed red head who meets the acquaintance of a girl who is different in every way: Bertie. She comes from a rich family, speaks properly, with wonderful manners and very smart.They met under a boardwalk on a beach in Atlantic City, after Bertie lost her mother and Aunt. Cee Cee adapts her for a short while and brings her along to an audition for a play. As Cee Cee starts to sing Bernie is wowed as she 'never has heard anyone sing that good'. After that they swap information and promise to write to one another. They then start to send letters which leads into their adulthood.As maybe guessed they do meet each other again later in life in a bar in New York where Cee Cee adopts her again.The book follows their life during relationships, marriage/breakups sex, love, death and carers, but mostly friendship; and the importance of friendships.I think both characters balance each other out in the best way, they feed off each other, more so Bertie throughout the book, especially towards the end. I would recommend this book to everyone. I think there is something real to this book which everyone can relate a part of their life to, no matter what age.Also, a lot of people seem to hate Cee Cee's character for being nasty, and potty mouthed. However I kinda love that. I think the selfishness which she processes is very real, and it is just who she is, but she is also hard working, loving and very broken; this is where they both balance each other out. For now, this continues to be my favorite book, and if you have not, watch the movie. I would personally say watch the movie first as it provided an even better vision when reading."}, {"userName": "Diane", "userReviewDate": "Jun 28, 2017", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/1332180-diane", "userReview": "You are the wind beneath my wings..........Leigh Ann.

Personally I loved 'Beaches', I just couldn't put it down and thought the pacing of the story was wonderful. I liked how it switched back to 1983 and how it draws into that year at the end of the book. The only thing that bothered me was Bertie's character. SPOILER....I mean she thinks she hears her husband sleeping with CeeCee in the next room and what does she do? go lie on the bed and cry I mean seriously? I'm sure if anyone heard that they would be right out there in a rage. She also doesn't discuss this with CeeCee and leaves her confused and hurt for months.

Most of the batchmates were getting our passports made (in a bright eyed anticipation), for which we needed to travel to Chandigarh, where the nearest passport office was located. So, I and one of my best friends, did the same. In that pre-digital age, it sometimes could be a two-day job, and we needed to stay overnight there, which we did at the home of an aunt of hers. Later that night, we ended up watching a movie on the TV. It was about two girl friends, whose personalities, as well as family background, were as different as could be. A chance encounter on the beach as little girls marks the start of their life-long friendship, and they provide strength to each other through all the tribulations of life. \"I can fly higher than an eagle, for you are the wind beneath my wings\" It was a funny and heart-breaking story, and had a deep impact on me. More so, because I was at that stage of life, when friends are our lifelines, and we had the deep sadness of parting looming very close. Few years later, I could not remember the name of the movie, or the actors (the number of English movies I had seen till then were in single digit numbers, low single digit actually!) But, I could not forget the movie, or the song. Then, internet came by, and eventually the search engines and their databases improved a whole lot, and I managed to find not only the name of the movie and the lead actor (Beaches, Bette Midler), but also that it is based on a book!!The dampener on my excitement was that I could not find a way of procuring that book \u2013 amazon and flipkart were a few years away, and popular bookstores were still as bad in terms of inventory. And when it did show up on the radar, it was extremely expensive, being imported and all. Then last year I found that I could also get used books online, with bookchor and amazon having a huge inventory to search from. So, I finally got a copy a few months ago for a very reasonable sum of 150 rs (and I think it is the original paperback edition).I shared the discovery with the above mentioned friend (we are still very close friends), but though she remembered the visit, she didn\u2019t remember much about the movie or the song. My heart just broke to pieces :,(So, coming back to the book - I finally read the book over last two days, I just could not put it down. Even though I remembered most of the story, even though the main character was loud and sometimes vulgar, even though it had some predictable sequences, I just loved it. My eyes kept getting moist, shedding a tear or two here and there, whiles sometimes I silently chuckled. Such is the vivacity of Cee Cee Bloom, who brightens up anywhere she goes, who knows that she is amazing and doesn\u2019t shy away from proclaiming it, who can be selfish and cowardly, but is also capable of giving endless, selfless love. And such is the sweetness of Bertie, who frustrates us with her goodness and incomprehensible helplessness, but makes us sympathize with her for the way she is conditioned to be so. And such is the story of a friendship that transcends all boundaries. Although this can't be called an epistolary novel, the story is assisted by a number of letters exchanged by the two friends over the years (but not all of the letters they wrote). I loved the way their letters expressed their fears and excitement, and evolved as they grew older. If you have had a friend who has been with you through good times and bad, or if you have seen the movie and loved it, I highly recommend the book. I recommend it anyway :D (even though my feeling about the book may be biased by what I remember of the movie from all those years ago :)"}, {"userName": "Kimberly", "userReviewDate": "Aug 23, 2017", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/2771351-kimberly", "userReview": "Sometimes the movie is better. This is the case with Beaches.The basics are all here in the book: the two friends meeting on the Boardwalk, the pen pal relationship, the adult turmoil. Cee Cee is a foul-mouthed singer who manages to make it big. Bertie (Hillary in the film) is...well, I don't know what she is. She doesn't seem to have any direction in this book, other than being Michael's wife. And that is the big problem with the book, because the characters don't really feel like emotional characters. They have flaws, but you don't care.The climax of the movie happens on the very last page of the book, and is over in one sentence. There is no emotion there, either.I will be forever grateful that we have this book because someone was able to turn it into the beloved movie.

I loved the movie (makes me cry EVERY time!) and thought I'd enjoy seeing where the screenplay came from. The basic storyline was there however the characters were definitely enhanced by the actresses playing them as Cee Cee was much more lovable in the adaptation. I enjoyed reading the different perspectives in the story such as John and Michael (Cee Cee and Bertie's husbands) as they had more to say throughout the book instead of always seeing things from Cee Cee and Bertie's point of view as in the movie. I think the movie ending much improved on that of the book (it's the same outcome) and will say no more so as not to spoil it.
