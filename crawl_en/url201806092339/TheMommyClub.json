Only as an adult was I permitted to explore the bolder, sweeter enclaves of the city. Even then, I never had the joy of experiencing this city quite the way Trudy describes it. Probably, I was never really a native of this city, only a visitor; I really belong to the tribes of the suburbs. That said, the magically real San Antonio that Sarah Bird constructs makes me long for a youth I never had. The descriptions are so lush, and Trudy is so sweetly naive; I just want to be her, pregnant, dreaming, trailing along in a Fiesta parade, covered in paper flowers. One of my favorite books of all time."}, {"userName": "Sally", "userReviewDate": "Mar 07, 2009", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/1689272-sally", "userReview": "This book is not the light, fluffy, chick lit read the title (or even the description on the back) leads you to believe. Even though it was not the type of read I was expecting it was still quite good. The writing was so vivid, when she felt the baby move in her I was flooded with memories of that stage of pregnancy. When she was laying in bed so depressed she couldn't open her eyes, I was thrown back to the saddest days I've had. A ver very well written piece, but not what I was expecting from the title and cover."}, {"userName": "Mmckinnie", "userReviewDate": "Aug 19, 2008", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/1150236-mmckinnie", "userReview": "I loved the last book she wrote, but I really did not enjoy this one much. The references to the city of San Antonio were neat if you are familiar with the city. However, the plot was very thin. I found the main character very hard to like. The situaion that she got herself in was very unbelievable and very hard to sympathize with. It annoys me when plots are too unrealistic."}, {"userName": "Whitaker", "userReviewDate": "Dec 10, 2010", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/4641163-whitaker", "userReview": "A really great book shows us how everything is great and worth to die for"}, {"userName": "Kevin Christensen", "userReviewDate": "Jan 14, 2012", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/1513216-kevin-christensen", "userReview": "Sarah Bird came to our attention with The Boyfriend School, and the HBO film Don't Tell Her It's Me, with Steve Guttenburg and Shelley Long, which is based on the last section of the book.The Mommy Club is the first person narrative of a surrogate mother, with flash backs behind, and a narrative flow that revisits characters from the past, to view their unexpected transformations and to experience how those changes influence the growth and choices made by the narrator. It's not the kind of book I usually pick for myself, but remains one of my favorites. Powerful, beautifully written, and profound."}, {"userName": "Cathy", "userReviewDate": "Jul 28, 2011", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/5855634-cathy", "userReview": "I bought this book to read while I was visiting in San Antonio, Texas. It takes place there. Sarah Bird did a great job of relating to the locale which I always enjoy while I'm traveling. I was extremely impressed with the story and the characters that she developed. A woman decides to act as a surrogate mother and reflects on how she got to where she is. Again, interesting characters and real action right in San Antonio. I am pleasantly surprised to recommend and would read another of her books without traveling to Texas!"}, {"userName": "Nettle", "userReviewDate": "Apr 10, 2012", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/7114639-nettle", "userReview": "Given that at one time I was thinking about moving to San Antonio, I loved the insiders view of the city this book provides...but I'm a sucker for finely detailed settings. I was also carried along by the story--a woman carrying a baby for her employer--while also longing to slap some sense into both the protagonist and the woman who is exerting ownership of the baby in her womb. A funny, sharply drawn, affecting story of pregnancy, motherhood, and class warfare in a particular place and culture."}, {"userName": "Michele", "userReviewDate": "Feb 02, 2008", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/632553-michele", "userReview": "I feel the need to justify my 3 stars as this is classed as your typical \"chick lit.\" I picked it up on a whim at a thrift store for 50 cents. I found myself laughing out loud at some of her takes on pregnancy, culture and life. Though many plot points were contrived, I found myself liking the characters and the way she developed them. They were not as flat as one would expect from a \"fluff\" piece."}, {"userName": "Sharmyn (Lumsden) Lilly", "userReviewDate": "May 27, 2014", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/28599044-sharmyn-lumsden-lilly", "userReview": "Another great Sarah Bird novel. Set in San Antonio (where I've lived) and concerning getting pregnant, pregnancy, and having a child (which I've not), I found it just as riveting as the other Sarah Bird books I've read (and I've loved them all). Sarah Bird is a great novelist.
