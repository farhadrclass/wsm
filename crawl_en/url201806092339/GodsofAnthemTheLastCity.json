We've got a zombocalypse, an enormous fight for freedom from an authoritarian regime, cancer victims, hulk-outs, and even a bit of poetry and music. What more could we ask for in a YA?Um, we could always ask for and receive some actually nice romance. Yeah! Romance! Liza and Jeremy are so cute together! Maybe I'm just a sucker for writers who love musicians. Or maybe it's the purple eyes or the nigh-immortality or the sweetness in the face of all these hungry shambling hoards (and even the zombies!)Of course, this book isn't all about the list of cool features or even the fact that we even get time to wage war with Tommy and hulk out as if we're all playing an awesome game of Resident Evil with a very, very generous dose of Alice In Wonderland. Cool, right?And all the while Jeremy is out to free them all from the terrible yoke of the elite rich and their dangerous survival techniques. Come on! I *love* body mods. Of course, these kinds of body mods are a bit extreme, but what can we do! It's an extreme kind of world! :)This book has great pacing and a lot of fun characters and action and character development, but none of that is quite as amazing as the end. Fair warning, however... these kinds of reveals might absolutely prevent you from avoiding the next book in the series. :) :)Thanks to the author for a copy of this book!"}, {"userName": "Cranky - The Book Curmudgeon", "userReviewDate": "Jan 27, 2015", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/39383783-cranky---the-book-curmudgeon", "userReview": "***** 5 Cranky Stars *****Have you ever come across a book that crawls inside your soul from page one and obliterates your heart by the end? This book did that to me and so much more. In Gods of Anthem, Logan Keys' debut novel, the world has been destroyed and people are still greedy for power. There is so little left in the world and instead of working together, the power hungry and avaricious are in control.On an island of sick kids, who should be receiving the best treatment possible, they are treated like prisoners. On the other side of the world, unstoppable monsters are created in order to gain more power.In the city of Ashes, Anthem, people are stratified into haves and haves not, and strictly controlled. Fed up, they are ready to fight and when a girl comes back from the dead, a fire is lit.This is not my usual genre and yet, it's now on my top ten favorite books list. The only issue I had with this book is it ended, leaving me a raw exposed blubbering mess. I look forward to the next book as this one leaves you pining for more."}, {"userName": "Basia", "userReviewDate": "Sep 16, 2016", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/41865563-basia", "userReview": "You know how every once in a LOOOOONG, EXTREMELY RARE, while, you happen to just hit a steak where every book you read is absolutely magnificent?? Well, somehow, I've been in that wonderful place for something like 3 weeks, and maybe 5 or more books. I got this book from NetGalley about a year ago. And it's just been sitting on my Kindle, gathering digital dust. But as soon as I started to read it, I simply could not stop. Not until I finished. I'm surprised by a number of things as they relate to this book. For instance, it carries a rating average of over 4.5, higher than any book I've read. However, when I glanced through the reviewers' names last night, and again just now, I didn't recognize a single name. I am so curious about why that is. Also, I haven't seen any discussion of this book. Now, maybe that's because I've been somewhat out of touch. Still, the book has been out for over a year, and it's one that should be read by ALL. Curiously, this author mentions she has a short story collection as well, Unhinged, but I'm unable to find it for sale anywhere. But back to the book. It seems to be a debut. And holy SHIT, what a way to come out of the gate!!! The characters swallow you from the first page. And just when I thought there cannot possibly be another zombie-related book I could stand to read, along came this book. So yes, it has zombies, but it also has dictators, islands where the sick are housed, scary, seemingly less than human guards enforcing order everywhere in this failed utopia, trans-humans, worse-than-reeducation facilities for those who try to rebel, underground entertainment, and a revolution that tries to bubble up from below all this. I'm thinking that to call this a sort of modernized 1984 reality is probably going over the top in my excitement from having just finished it. However, there are similarities. The ending, the last few lines, in particular. No neatly wrapped up story with a bow on top, although the entire journey is just magnificent. I urge you to read this book for yourself. Perhaps I've read it after most of those who share here on Goodreads. But if that's not the case, if there are others like me who had not known of this book until now, disregard the weird and not very interesting book cover and RUN to obtain a copy. Download immediately. You will LOVE it."}, {"userName": "Emma", "userReviewDate": "Feb 15, 2017", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/8575414-emma", "userReview": "3.5 stars. The post apocalyptic setting is a bit different in this book which was a refreshing change. I found the mash up of ideas in this book a bit much and The the 'romance' between Jeremy and Liza was unconvincing.

Only it\u2019s for those children who are sick and dying. And Liza is ready. She\u2019s accepted her fate and she\u2019s ready to go. When suddenly, she allowed to go to Anthem. And things aren\u2019t much better in Anthem. The authority have everything under a tight scrutiny, and there she meets Jeremy and her whole world turns upside down. She\u2019s suddenly given purpose and a meaning. And it isn\u2019t because she\u2019s found a man, it\u2019s because of this man\u2019s purpose.Then we meet Tommy Hatter. He\u2019s a weapon. Not just that he uses one, but he IS one. Only Tommy\u2019s weapon isn\u2019t easily controlled and doesn\u2019t discriminate when it\u2019s set loose. Tommy\u2019s only real friend is a young girl named Joelle. And she scares people more than he does.These two stay apart throughout the whole book until the last couple of chapters. There isn\u2019t much in the way of romance, but this cross-genre book still reads like one. These two people are destined for greatness, even if they are only friends. (which I\u2019m thinking is possible.)I can\u2019t really discuss much in the book without giving away some major plot points. I will tell you, you\u2019re set up for the next book. I will also tell you that once you start on this book, you WILL.NOT.PUT.IT.DOWN. For reals. I read it all in one day. Not even the full day. Just a chunk of it. I\u2019m probably going to read it again because I just KNOW I\u2019m going to find something new and awesome about it.Ms. Keys immerses you deep into her dystopian/post-apocalyptic world full of insanity and heart-break and hope. It\u2019s really hard to classify this book. It\u2019s definitely YA. After that, it crosses so many genre lines that it\u2019s almost impossible to just pick two or three other areas. I positively LOVE this book. There aren\u2019t enough words. For reals. So would I recommend this book, you may ask\u2026..Why you ask such silly questions?!?!?! Of COURSE I do.

It has great characters 2. It has a great plot 3. The storyline is moving 4. It has mystery 5. It made me beg for more.I am not a professional reviewer but I consider myself a seasoned reader. Books, stories, ideas and imaginations come in different forms and styles. I enjoy all of them. Then occasionally a story like Gods of Anthem gets written and rocks me to my core. It's a very well written love story. Not between two people but love for family, friends and for anything else that one believed in. It's not for the faint of heart, it's not a Sunday read, it also had its slow moments which tempted me to skip those parts but I persisted because that was when Anthem was created and molded into a real tangible place in my mind. The characters developed into real people and made me fall in love with them. And the story was woven until I found myself caught in its web of mystery full of action and suspense.It tells of a girl and a boy, with two separate lives and different tales yet somehow intertwined with the other, who eventually finds one another in the book. (Read the blurb if you want the gist, but I'm not telling you anything else.) Whether there will be anything more between them than just being two great characters existing side by side, I have no idea. Because that is how great this writer is. She spun a tale of heartache so poignant it nearly broke my heart, then she injected adrenalin into my system that I wondered whether the world was still intact with every heartbeat, then she held my hand and told me to breathe, stop and smell the roses before sending me crashing to my final descent and wondering what the heck just happened and had I survived it because up until now I am still in limbo.Did I like the book?

I'm a Youth Services Librarian and a YA author. I've read so many YA books that it is difficult to impress me, but this novel truly impressed me!\"Gods of Anthem\" is a Dystopian novel written by YA author, Logan Keys. I'm very honored Logan chose me to beta read for her because I could not put this book down! Her prose is spot-on, the pace is perfect... oh, and I must mention the cute boys! (You'll have to decide for yourselves whether you're #TeamJeremy or #TeamTommy!) I loved how the author wove the two characters' stories together and how they eventually found one another. It had suspense and mystery, yet underneath it was a story about love and courage. Parts of this book were heartbreaking and I caught myself tearing up. I cannot wait for the sequel. (Please, Logan, tell me there WILL be more!) If you enjoyed books such as \"The Hunger Games,\" \"Divergent,\" and \"The Forest of Hands and Teeth,\" you'll enjoy this novel.

I loved the back and forth narration, and I loved it even more when the pieces came together. I\u2019m a sucker for character development, and I was not disappointed. IMO, the characters are one of the biggest strengths of this book. I felt like I could see all of them in my mind, and they are all sort of complicated so that you don\u2019t know how to feel about them, especially Jeremy Writer. Wait, that\u2019s not true, I love Jeremy Writer in all his complicated, revolutionary glory. I love his spark and passion, even if he takes it a bit too far. The author did a great job of choosing who to narrate the book, because I could identify with both Liza and Tommy in different ways, and through them a picture unfolds of the world around them. One of my favorite things in dystopian books is finding hope amidst madness, and the characters are for sure the hope here.

Let's write a book that has the potential to be really good. We'll pull in a bunch of different elements, including mutants + zombies, a post-apocalyptic world, and a dystopian city setting. We'll also make sure to fill it with at least a few interesting characters that readers can really root for. ......and then we'll blow it all to hades by injecting an entirely unnecessary and vaguely disturbing romantic element on the female protagonist's part. Because, y'know, we just can't write a young adult novel without having thoughts of true love and passionate kisses involved. And wa-la! You have The Last City!Okay, so maybe that was a little over-dramatic because even if you'd taken the hormones out, I still don't think I'd have liked The Last City all that much. While I genuinely do like how the author brought a few different elements together, it's not really anything that stands out. Peter Clines' Ex-Heroes book does the mutants versus zombies premise in a more interesting fashion. All the other elements have been done, and done, and done again. Even zombies aren't quite enough to save it. It took me three attempts to be able to finish the book.Alright, that's not quite fair. Here's where it really is, and I just figured this out whilst writing up the review. I would have liked this whole book a lot more if we just cut out all the sections with Liza. At least Tommy's story was interesting, and his relationship with Joelle was one I definitely wanted to read more of. Ooh, there's an idea! Can we have a few more young adult books where there's affection without attraction? Can we acknowledge that not all young adults are boiling stews of hormonal juices and deliver stories that don't at least partially rely on all the mushy feels? Pleeease?Logan Keys can write. Not even going to pretend otherwise. There was some serious talent involved in writing The Last City. She had so many good quotable lines in here!\"What kind of monster would bash my brains in for being out at night? I know what kind. One who thinks he protects us by stripping away our rights. ... To endure the worst things 'for our own good'.\"or even simply:\"It's never too expensive to be a good human being.\"Can we just have that one plastered everywhere? We, in America, need to get that through our collective heads. It's NEVER too expensive to be a good human being!!That's what makes it even more frustrating. That she has this novel that has so many awesome aspects to it, and then she has this ...this...relationship shoved into it. One that really legitimately is vaguely disturbing in the beginning. The Last City was almost awesome! But..almost doesn't count. However, I do think Logan Keys is an author to keep an eye on. I think she's got the potential to blow us away.

One is Liza's and the other is Tommy's. Alternating between the two every so often, not necessarily at chapter breaks. Which maybe made the story more confusing for me, at least for first 2/3rd of the book. Although, I did prefer Liza's story over Tommy's because it was a little less complicated. Oh yeah\u2026there's zombies in this as well\u2026which I'm usually freaked out by them, because they give me nightmares. These zombies, though, are sorta kept behind the walls so to speak, at least most of the time. The zombie theme is not overly prevalent, which I did like, because, I didn't have any sleepless nights while reading this.Ultimately, though, The Last City feels more like a prequel because of it's rather anti-climatic ending. I felt like the story only became engaging within the last few pages. I think the series has the potential to be exceptional, I just don't know if the Author can pull it off, at least for me.\u21ddRatings Breakdown\u21dcPlot: 3.8/5Main Characters: 3.8/5Secondary Characters: 3.8/5The Feels: 3.5/5Addictiveness: 3/5Theme or Tone: 4/5Flow (Writing Style): 3/5Backdrop (World Building): 3.3/5Originality: 4/5Book Cover: 4/5 My Cover is the one that says The Last CityEnding: 3.8/5 Cliffhanger: Yes, pretty muchWill I continue this series?

There's also Jeremy (whose story takes place through Liza's POV). He's just all about freedom and justice, but he has his secrets. Then there's Joelle ( whose story is told from Tommy's POV).

YA/Dystopian, the work is set in a post apocalyptic world where zombies roam the earth, people are sick, and hope is limited. There is little humanity left on earth, both in terms of numbers and compassion. Opposing forces strictly control those remaining: one in the City of Ashes and a patriotic army in waiting overseas, setting the scene for confrontation and rebellion.Told from the dual points of view of Lisa and Tommy: one of the sick and one of the specials. Their experiences are markedly different, but converge in a heart-stopping fashion. Full of lovable characters, as well as ambiguous ones, and villains, I was engrossed in how events would unfold. Logan hooked me with her lyrical prose and did a fantastic job of interweaving the strands and elements, drawing you in and driving the story home.

Y no me defraudo. Muerte, monstruos, revoluci\u00f3n, villanos, libertad, sacrificios, lealtad, amor. La trama es original y atrapante con elementos muy positivos como: el apocalipsis zombie, la descripciones del mundo y los personajes geniales. Adem\u00e1s el libro est\u00e1 bien escrito y la forma en que est\u00e1 narrado, con los diferentes puntos de vista, es acertada. Personajes: Son geniales y est\u00e1n muy bien caracterizados. Liza es mi personaje favorito. A pesar de todas las locuras y cosas terribles que ha vivido, ella es una protagonista femenina muy fuerte. Por otro lado, Tommy tambi\u00e9n es un personaje muy, muy interesante. Ambos son elementales para la historia por la complejidad de sus personalidades y sus luchas personales. En cuanto, a Jeremy, tambi\u00e9n ha sido agradable, \u00e9l tiene sus propios objetivos, una misi\u00f3n, pero aun no he desarrollado un criterio concreto sobre \u00e9l.Romance: No es un elemento central en la historia, pero es bastante lindo. Liza y Jeremy son adorables cuando est\u00e1n juntos. Por otro lado, no es exactamente una relaci\u00f3n rom\u00e1ntica, quiz\u00e1s solo sean amigos en el futuro, pero me gusto como la autora escribi\u00f3 la historia de Liza y Tommy al mismo tiempo y como ellos se encontraron al final. Me hubiera gustado que aquello no tardar\u00e1 tanto, pero tampoco es algo negativo. Final: Fue genial, lleno de tantos giros inesperados. No es exactamente un final inconcluso, pero estoy deseando leer la secuela. Como conclusi\u00f3n, The Last City es una historia incre\u00edble en un mundo perdido lleno de oscuridad y monstruos. Tiene acci\u00f3n, romance, un apocalipsis zombie, personajes geniales y un estilo de escritura agradable.*Recib\u00ed est\u00e1 novela gratis a trav\u00e9s de NetGalley, pero eso no ha afectado mi opini\u00f3n sobre ella. Muchas gracias a la editorial."}, {"userName": "Julia", "userReviewDate": "Jun 11, 2015", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/14096038-julia", "userReview": "Actually, three and a half stars!Revolutions are not as exciting or as easy to plan as some think. Raising people into great feeling is easy, but to plan it into a meaningful direction? That takes wisdom, foresight, and some luck. The Gods of Anthem is set in a time of a post-apocalyptic city that\u2019s on the verge of bringing itself out of the military strict confines that bind it. We have a secret army. We have revolutionaries in town. We have some powerful people that obviously have some long term plans. Now all we need is a leader or leaders. But let\u2019s look at the story. Spoilers ahead.It starts out by showing how miserable the world is with an assault on our main character, Liza. Then we learn her and everyone around her at the hospital are dying from cancer due to radiation permeating the planet. Clearly, we are in dire need of some revival. It becomes evident that Liza is chosen to play some part in the revival of the human race as she miraculously starts recovering and is sent to the last real city, Anthem.People are focused on surviving there and not thriving according to our man in the shadows, and Liza is meant to use her musical ability to turn things around. I waited to see what Liza was going to do to revive people. But Liza didn\u2019t actively do a whole lot. I did not see her fight for freedom per say. I don\u2019t really \u201cfeel\u201d her passionately desiring freedom. Mainly, she seemed content as long as she had Jeremy and her music. The one time she did something was for Jeremy, not herself or for freedom.As for Tommy, who is in the secret army training, I still don\u2019t understand why he went into deeper training and why, at the end of training, it was decided he was ready to lead \u2013 he still had not learned to control his \u201cmonster\u201d within. Also, I forgot what the book description had said about him being in a secret army and thought he was part of the Authority\u2019s army or something. Therefore, I wasn\u2019t invested in his story not seeing a point to his army experience. So don\u2019t be put off from reading due to my opinion on Tommy. I think I may have just missed an important point at the beginning.Then we have Jeremy. It will be interesting to see what becomes of him if he is in book two much. He is actively fighting for freedom. Driven men are fun. I liked the twists brought on by him later in this book.Now, while it looks as though I view the characters unfavorably, the story was a great page turner. Always something going on. The ending was really interesting and indicates finally that Tommy and Liza are going to not just meet but will work together.I will definitely be reading the next book with an ending like that! Cannot wait to see if Liza starts to feel the pull for fighting for her own personal freedom outside of Jeremy and her music. I want to see her become more active as a character.142px-RATED_PG-13_svg I am adding this due to the assault on Liza on the very opening of the book. I know there are some kids on Facebook that read my reviews and thought it was a good idea. I know ratings and trigger warnings are a big controversy right now, but I am planning to use them starting now. I will be adding information to my rating page about how I will use them soon!I received this book on Netgalley for an honest review."}, {"userName": "Lvautier", "userReviewDate": "Feb 16, 2017", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/15726160-lvautier", "userReview": "Books like these make are part of what make rating systems so difficult. I was in the mood for something a little lighter to balance out some of my other reading. I sampled and abandoned a few other books on my e-reader before settling on this one. ( Gratuitous use of words like critter as a simulacrum of character development is now officially one of my pet peeves.)  I found this more satisfying than most YA fiction that I have tried. Too much YA makes the dystopian setting an elaborate backdrop for not very compelling personal conflicts, and the story often eventually becomes a journey along well worn paths. I found myself caring about the characters which made the story compelling. I am looking forward to the next book in the series. Back to the rating. For YA fiction I would give it 5 stars, for dystopian 4 stars, . . . but I just gave a Jim Harrison book 4 stars. I hate rating systems. I think Logan Keys delivered more than I expected, more than what the genre usually delivers, so 4 stars."}, {"userName": "Brittany Shivers", "userReviewDate": "May 15, 2015", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/28609498-brittany-shivers", "userReview": "Gods of Anthem is a YA Dystopian/Post-Apocalyptic novel.A city of ash.

Set in a dystopian future, where even the young can still recall better days, it follows ves of two people whose lives are not their own; one controlled by the ruling tyranny, the other by the resistance. Through horrific circumstance and against overwhelming odds they fight for a cause often beyond their understanding. And they drag the unsuspecting reader right along with them, wrenching emotions at a dizzying pace.The prose style in this book is constant throughout; it's unique, raw and refreshing. And though it pulls no punches it is so mesmerising that you'll enjoy the story as much for the writing as you do for the plot.I feel very lucky to have got my paws on this book for a beta-read, well ahead of release, so what I've read may not be the final version. But I can promise you, it will only get better.

Great job Ms. Keys!! I absolutely love this world you've created of zombies and \"specials\"! I normally don't care for books with zombies but your portrayal and how they occur is more realistic and has won me over! I loved the clever writing of two different stories that came together at the end. I was so excited about the evolving love stories, and then you had a different twist in mind at the end of the story that was so cleverly done!

We laughed, held our breath and were blown away by the 'what the hell' and the 'omfg' moments.We also loved the way is was written from different POV's (being that of Liza and Tommy).Oh did we just mention Tommy.Tommy.A machine.He's been built that way.But all he really wants.Is normalcy.To feel normal.Guys, you'll love him.And Jeremy and Joelle.Yep you'll love them too.We honestly refuse to say anymore other than we cannot thank Logan Keys enough for giving us the opportunity to read Gods Of Anthem.If YA Dystopian is your thing, then reading Gods Of Anthem is a big MUST read.For us a definite 5 star read."}, {"userName": "T.M.

I will honestly say I don't read a lot of YA Dystopian but this book was freaking fantastic. There were times I found myself saying What\"??????? Then I was wanting to throw my kindle across the room saying OH NOOOOO.Liza oh poor Liza is a young girl who sent to some freaked out island for the dead basically. Led to believe she has cancer and that she has survived becoming a zombie a few times it\u2019s a wonder the poor girl hasn't gone insane. But Liza is a very strong young woman. Then the author gives us Tommy who is so twisted inside it's a wonder he knows if he is coming or going. Well bring these two together and you get one hell of a story. Then add in Jeremy well we just get one heck of a story filled with monsters and zombies and one very screwed up government. This book is very well written, the author does a fantastic job with the dual POV's I worry with POV books as some get me so twisted and lost but not this author she keeps me right on track and the story is wonderful.

Logan Keys gave us a YA dystopian/post-apocalyptic novel that was unlike anything I've ever read. Literally within seconds of finishing, I had to e-mail Logan and said \"Holy hell in a hand basket. that was AMAZING!\" If I could rate it 6 stars, I would. It left me with a deep book hangover, completely unable to read for a few days afterward.Logan has expertly woven numerous elements into one grisly, heart-wrenching story. Romance, mythical beings, an island for the sick and a shady government provided us a plot with so many twists and turns there was no way to guess what would be coming next.This story is given to us from two points of view, one is Liza, and the other is Tommy. Liza was a patient on the island for the sick and dying. Tommy is being used as a secret weapon for the government. There are so many secondary characters that we come across, some making their mark on my soul, while others, I'm still questioning. But Tommy and Liza, working on opposite sides merge together in a unique way in the last few chapters, that left me begging for more, needing the next book NOW.Keri(Copy provided in exchange for an honest review.)"}, {"userName": "Michael Chambers", "userReviewDate": "Apr 25, 2015", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/18419727-michael-chambers", "userReview": "I'm not usually much for dystopian or YA, but Gods of Anthem had me hooked from the beginning. It's hard not to empathize with Liza as she struggles throughout the story to come to grips with her own existence, and Tommy, who wants nothing more than to be normal. The two of them redefine the term \"unlikely allies\" on their quest.Rather than show us yet another band of survivors in a zombie apocalypse, we find the world having adapted to the crisis. Still, Gods of Anthem is no rosy, all-is-well, feel-good story, so brace yourself.Logan Keys has penned an entertaining, cautionary tale about survival at any cost, with subtle jabs at the idea of totalitarian rule in the name of safety. A dark and disturbing, but still fun read that proves that not all YA fiction is light and without substance, Gods of Anthem will keep you enthralled from start to finish."}, {"userName": "Julie Ayling", "userReviewDate": "Jun 02, 2015", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/34716445-julie-ayling", "userReview": "I was given a copy for an arc review for my honest review.

I love how she's taken two different stories of two different souls and made them work together in one story.
