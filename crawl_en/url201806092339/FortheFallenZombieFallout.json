Have you ever read a book or series that just sticks with you? You find yourself talking about it all the time, thinking about the characters a lot or recommending it to as many people as possible because you just can't wait to have new people to talk with about it? This is the series that did that to me!! I knew I found a gem when I stumbled upon the first Zombie Fallout book and, here I am 7 books later, just as big of a fan now as I was by the end of book 1! Actually, no.....I'm a bigger fan now than I was then!Do you like zombies? Action? Blood and Gore? Sarcasm? If your answer is, \"yes\" to even one of these, I suggest reading this book. The chances are that if you're even thinking about reading ZF7 then you have probably read the first 6 in this series. If so, don't even bother with my review....just download the book and start reading!!Mike and the whole Talbot clan are back for another thrilling adventure as they decide to look for Doc Baker in the hopes that he can help out Justin and B.T. With the evil Eliza out of the picture for good and the epic battle that took place at the Talbot Compound behind them....how bad could a road trip possibly be?? If you've read the other ZF books then you can probably guess the answer to that. It's Michael Talbot for crying out loud!! Of course there's going to be extenuating circumstances and new threats!Zombie Fallout 7 takes you on a very eventful road trip with lot's of action, tons of zombies and many MANY laughs!!I have one small criticism. The ending seemed kind of odd. It's pretty obvious that there will be a Zombie Fallout 8 by the way the book ended but it kind of ended in the middle of something. It really doesn't matter to me one bit because I still LOVED this book and will ALWAYS be a HUGE Mark Tufo fan!! Soooo.....is Zombie Fallout 8 out yet?? ;-)"}, {"userName": "Vix", "userReviewDate": "Oct 22, 2013", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/7521915-vix", "userReview": "OH my! so much emotion in this one.I was thrown back into the action straight off, some small recaps so I was not totally confused, which was great.Its nice to see the return/gathering of some \"lost\" characters.My main \"fun\" moment was the return of Trip - how can you not love this guy, his escape and find is amazing and really brought a sense of humour to the whole thing.I have to admit that I found this episode very hard going on the emotions, its a real rollercoaster.Some new elements were introduced, such as the Army and Will & June in the labs.... now where is that going to go! not to mention all the history on the release of the flu virus.... intriguing.I really got drawn into Deneaux, and her back story with this new ongoing plot line its sure to be something sinister coming! roll on book 8!The zombies are also now evolving, with Eliza gone, but into what! Other reviews have commented on the flashbacks at the end being \"tedious\" but actually I always find them enjoyable and love the way that MT manages to weave his other books in to the ZF world."}, {"userName": "Shana Festa", "userReviewDate": "Nov 21, 2013", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/9185553-shana-festa", "userReview": "When I grow up, I want to be Mark Tufo! This author is fantastic. He manages to once again spin a tale of terror while still managing to make me laugh out loud. His newest piece of work has earned the coveted Five-Star Fire Rating from the Bookie Monster.Zombie Fallout 7 is the latest in Tufo's line of great titles. Without Eliza to keep the zombies at bay, it's an all out dog fight for the survival of Mike Talbot and company. The race against time is on for BT and Justin, still infected and in danger of turning. Once again they battle zombie and man alike. Not to mention the ever present Henry the dog stinky pooting, which is almost worse than zombies. (Having two dogs, I can tell you...there is nothing worse than puppy poots)The zombies are getting smarter. They show signs of thinking and planning. They've even begun assessing situations and running away when risk outweighs reward. But the real stand out for this reader is the banter between Mike and BT. Tufo continues telling the story from the perspective of Mike's journal entries. And Mike continues to be a highly sarcastic and sometimes self deprecating narrator.The only problem with a Tufo book is that it ends! This reader is impatiently already waiting for book 8. If the humor doesn't get you, then the unique story line and well thought out characters will. Much like me, I suspect you won't be able to put it down. This latest installment is every bit exciting and captivating as the first book. A feat hard to achieve as most series fall victim to waning and regurgitated story lines. Each book in the Zombie Fallout series has been original and there has been no decline in momentum.I listened to the audio version, narrated by Sean Runnette, and was pleased at the dry humor his voice injected into the story. The only thing I would have liked to see differently is the voice chosen for Tommy. It was just a touch too juvenile for me.Zombie Fallout is one of the best zombie series on the market. It doesn't hurt that Tufo is a fellow Bostonian, either. If you haven't read them yet...well, shame on you! Get to reading! You won't be disappointed.Visit www.bookie-monster.com to read my full review"}, {"userName": "Nathan Tullis", "userReviewDate": "Oct 22, 2015", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/18356135-nathan-tullis", "userReview": "*I received a free copy of this audiobook for review from Audiobookreviewer.com*If you have read my previous reviews of the other Zombie Fallout books, you know I\u2019m a big fan of the series. Tufo has a unique style in his writing; he combines the dark and gritty reality of zombies with some just as dark and gritty humor. I don\u2019t know this for fact but it seems that Mark is a family man. There are scenes in his books that really pull at the heart, he really makes you feel what the Talbots are feeling. The scenarios these people are thrown into time and time again, become almost relatable; I care about these characters.In typical Tufo fashion, the story picks up right on the heels of the last. Eliza is dead, and with that; there is nothing stopping the zombie virus that is still running through the veins of BT and Justin. Mike and family load up another one of his brother\u2019s seemingly endless supply of trucks and set off to find Doc Baker. meanwhile, Stephanie and Tripp go on the road in there new bus in hopes of finding the Talbot\u2019s home in Maine, and Dr. Baker and Porkchop are rescued by a remaining faction of the military.Many of the zombie stories I\u2019ve read put their main focus on other humans as the foe, and while I think it is likely that would be the case should the Zompocalypse happen, this time around though, Tufo kind of changes the game. Without Eliza around to command them; the zombies are learning, using doorknobs, and even setting traps. It adds a needed change of pace that, I think, really adds life to the series. It\u2019s refreshing to read about truly terrifying creatures that, along with not suffering from human emotions such as fear or remorse, can actually tactically plan and learn from mistakes.Sean Runnette takes the reign yet again for Mr. Tufo reading both the witty banter and heartbreaking inner thoughts of Mike Talbot with emotion and fluidity. I\u2019ve said it before and I\u2019ll say it again. Runnette is Talbot; he is also BT, and Justin, and Tracy, and\u2026well, I think you get the point."}, {"userName": "Annie", "userReviewDate": "Feb 14, 2014", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/12534351-annie", "userReview": "I have devoured this series...and even listened to book 6 twice!!

I must have read near on over 100 zombie apocalyptic books; yes you can say Im addicted with no cure; I just cant get enough of them. But some series/stories really stick in your head and this is most certainly one of them, all 7 of them!Mark Tufo writes with a compelling and gripping style which is so realistic and believable you you just cannot put the book down...its glued...stuck to your hand and you just cannot look away!His sense of humour will make you laugh outloud and Mark has brought Mike Talbot and his clan to life...even Henry the bulldog; after reading all 6 books I feel part of the family and at home.So Ill shut up rambling now and tell you what you want to know; did I like book... 7...hell yeah!Mike and his family think they can can relax a bit after the epic battle and Eliza's demise, but hey....its The Talbot family here...not a hope....Now they are back on another road trip...there's always a road trip...as the rush is on to find Doc Baker, the only guy who maybe able to save BT and Justin from the virus....as it starts to take hold again...will they find him in time...?I'm so pleased to see the return of the Trip and Stephanie back in the group. Mark has nailed this hysterical \"weed lovin\" hippy who lost his mind in the 70's; accompanied by his long suffering wife Stephanie who just adores him!We get to see flashbacks to the history of Mr and Mrs Deneaux and the Demesne group pre-zombie and find out who did start the cold flu virus outbreak. Deneaux picks up a surprise hitchhiker and she continues with her web of lies and deceit, cruelty and spitefulness, did I miss anything out.Plus of course plenty of horrific zombie mayhem persists throughout with many close shaves...well it is Mike Talbot; brilliantly written as always and yet another incredible compelling heart felt read; I can't wait for book eight and I don't want this series to ever end.Another masterpiece from the master of zombie horror!"}, {"userName": "T.D.", "userReviewDate": "Nov 27, 2013", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/7942714-t-d", "userReview": "Well, I am a massive fan of Mark Tufo. His characters are fabulously realistic and the humour he injects is wonderful. I eagerly awaited this book for two reasons;I love Talbot and clan and was missing them and worried for BT and JustinI wanted to see what Trip and BT made of each other!This was a great book, full of the things that make Tufo's writing great. I really enjoyed the development of the story, the consequences of Eliza's demise and the urgency of saving two beloved characters. I enjoyed the new characters and the revelations the book holds. However, I felt that this book was essentially a road trip with no resolve. I LOVE THIS BOOK, don't think otherwise, but it felt over all too quickly and nothing had really happened. Of course, lots happened! It is packed full of great scenes but the overall story felt like it was on hold. This felt a little like a vehicle to get the story to the right point for ZF8. It was a bullet proof Hummer with roof mounted RPG, but a vehicle nonetheless.Let me make myself clear - this is a great book and I loved it as I have loved every ZF book. Mark Tufo is brilliant! As you can see, I have given it top marks and it's well deserved.SPOILERS FROM THIS POINT ONBT and Trip - The play between Trip and Talbot is brilliant. It matches that between BT and Talbot. I was looking forward to, and hoping for, a reunion between Trip and Talbot and was not disappointed. However, I was disappointed at how little time was devoted to that in the story. Don't get me wrong, I loved it, but I was hoping for more. I was really looking forward to BT's reaction to Trip but again felt a little cheated. I hoped for more time devoted to this and felt a little deflated by its brevity. There is a huge amount of action and peril accompanying this meeting and the brevity is reasonable. I was just a little disappointed."}, {"userName": "\u2764ArtfullySinful\u2764 ", "userReviewDate": "Mar 22, 2015", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/37584317-artfullysinful", "userReview": "While Stephanie and Trip are getting thrown out of their group, Michael and Tommy discover something that damn near tears both of their lives down.

Mark Tufo has continued to enthrall with his unique style of writing. In the continuing adventures(or misadventures)of Michael Talbot, he once again has taken us through every emotion conceivable. If you are a fan of the ZF series or just a fan of the writer, you will know this is the normal state for the reader. I was laughing out loud within the first 5-6 pages. Then I was reminded of what has kept me coming back and why Michael Talbot is a much loved character. Those smart ass remarks get you every time and this time BT takes center stage with him. And although Eliza is gone, the Zombies are not. They are still around and (Spoiler)becoming more resourceful. Family and friends are together again as they leave Maine and Ron's(Michael's brother)house in an attempt to find a cure for BT and his son Justin.

This firmly fit into the 2 star category for me. \"It was OK\". I really enjoyed the first 5 or so of them, read number 6 to see how it ended. Then this book comes along. Eliza is dead now and Tufo seemed to be struggling with the plot. How the hell does Michael Talbot not realize pretty much all the time that he's a super strong half vampire? The snark in this edition seemed kind of forced, as well. Lacked any kind of ending. The last 10% of the book is side stories and flashbacks. That confused the hell out of me because it just ended at a random chapter end. It was a good run. The first few books I really enjoyed.

Full of smart ass remarks and the return of John the tripper for some great laughs if you liked the ones before it you should definitely pick this one up. If you didn\u2019t, why the hell are you considering this one? One word of caution though. Don\u2019t read the Lycan Fallout book(s) before the end of this series.
