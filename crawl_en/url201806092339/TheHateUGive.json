I think we all wait for that one time though, that one time when it ends right.Maybe this can be it.\nThere are those books that are important and timely, worthy of reading because of the social and/or political message that they send. They fill a gap in the market; they make waves. They need to exist. And there are other books that are well-written, emotionally-charged and unputdownable - books that are not important as such, just really fucking good. But, on occasion, you find one of those rare wonderful creatures that is both important AND really fucking good.The Hate U Give is one of those books.I could tell you that this book is inspired by the \"Black Lives Matter\" movement. I could tell you that it rips unapolegetically into a subject that needed to be ripped into - the shootings of unarmed black people by police officers, as well as racial bias in the justice system. I could tell you that it opened my eyes to aspects of white privilege I never considered. All of that needs to be said, for sure, but I feel like I'm doing this book a disservice by highlighting its sociopolitical importance over the fact that it's also a fantastic, powerful and utterly unforgettable book.I don't know what your experiences were as a child, but when I was young, I remember my parents giving me a talk about how if I was ever lost or in trouble, I should look for a police officer. They would protect me, look after me, and make sure I got back to my parents unharmed. They are the people in society we should be able to trust. But the black protagonist of this book - Starr - gets a very different talk. About how to behave around police officers so she doesn\u2019t get arrested. Or shot.Unfortunately, her friend - Khalil - never got that talk.\nI\u2019ve seen it happen over and over again: a black person gets killed just for being black, and all hell breaks loose. I\u2019ve Tweeted RIP hashtags, reblogged pictures on Tumblr, and signed every petition out there. I always said that if I saw it happen to somebody, I would have the loudest voice, making sure the world knew what went down.Now I am that person, and I\u2019m too afraid to speak.\nThe Hate U Give is about how Starr deals with the aftermath of witnessing Khalil being shot by a cop for... doing absolutely nothing wrong. Her fear is palpable as she confronts a system that she knows is working against her. She's afraid to speak out, yet angry that Khalil's murderer could escape justice. We see, through Starr's eyes, how the media presents young black men as guilty until proven innocent - and when you're poor, black, and from a rough neighborhood, it's virtually impossible to appear innocent.Though, at its heart, this book first and foremost captures the perspective of a scared young girl. A girl with a loving family, complicated friendships with white teenagers at her school, and a white boyfriend. The relationship dynamics run alongside the fight for justice and are no less compelling. Thomas deftly portrays complex, nuanced relationships between all the people in the book, considering the divides between Starr and her white classmates, but never allowing anyone to become cliche or one-dimensional.Little humorous gems lay scattered throughout the dialogue:\nMomma reaches her fork onto my plate and breaks off a piece of pancake. \u201cWhat is Tumblr anyway? Is it like Facebook?\u201d\u201cNo, and you\u2019re forbidden to get one. No parents allowed. You guys already took over Facebook.\u201d\u201cYou haven\u2019t responded to my friend request yet.\u201d\u201cI know.\u201d\u201cI need Candy Crush lives.\u201d\u201cThat\u2019s why I\u2019ll never respond.\u201d\nIt's incredible how The Hate U Give manages to both break your heart and warm it in the space of just a few pages.What else can I even say? If you want to have your heart ripped out - read this book. If you want to read a great book about a girl dealing with family and relationships - read this book. If you want to cry, laugh, and then cry some more - read this book. If you're ready to change this stupid fucking world - read this book.Blog | Facebook | Twitter | Instagram | Youtube"}, {"userName": "Emma Giordano", "userReviewDate": "Mar 14, 2017", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/30604861-emma-giordano", "userReview": "This is a  MUST READ  for 2017 releases.I absolutely adored this book. I truly don't feel like it has a single flaw. Every topic addressed was approach so wonderfully and did not hold back. If you're looking for a diverse read that stands out amongst most YA,  The Hate U Give  is the book for you.I love Starr Carter so much. She's honestly such an inspiration to girls looking to find their voice. She is resilient, authentic, and everything we need in adolescents today. Although she is not completely fearless, she embraces the adversity in her way and stands against it. I don't know many people who could juggle the stresses in her life and come out weapons (in this case, words) blazing. Every moment in this book just filled me with pride for this girl and it was a pleasure being able to watch her grow.I also love the family dynamic in this book. I think it honestly might be the most healthy, realistic, close-knit family I've ever read in a YA. The siblings may tease each other, but they protect each other fiercely. The parents may not always get along, but they are head over heels in love. They always attempt to do what is best for their children, even if it may not be their own personal preference. It was so nice to have just a scene of a family sitting down to watch sports together, throwing a pool party, always working together. It is something I truly valued from this read.The strongest aspect of this book is it's social commentary and political criticism. This is the kind of book that should be in the hands of teens, making them aware of current issues, educating them on pressing matters, and encouraging them to get involved to create change. I absolutely left this read with an entirely new perspective I will carry with me in the future. It poses many important questions about racism, police brutality, discrimination, and prejudice while also answering them in a comprehensive and inviting way. It was fascinating to see the integration of such a powerful movement implemented into an accessible form of media for teens. I truly don't think you can leave this book without SOMETHING that will have made you say \"I never thought about it this way\", \"When you put it this way, that actually makes a lot of sense.\", and \"I'm glad someone finally told me this.\"Although this book is full of important moments related to the current state of marginalized populations, it is primarily about using your voice. I believe this book has the power to make readers realize just how much their words matter. Starr Carter is a perfect example of an individual who feels their voice does not matter but through courage, risk-taking, and ultimate strength, she realizes how crucial it is to speak up for what you are passionate about no matter how terrifying the consequences may seem. And I believe you will leave this book with that revelation as well.I cannot recommend this book enough. It's absolutely one of my favorite books of the year. I am so happy The Hate U Give exists, and I'm even more ecstatic that it is a 1! NYT best seller, out in to the world, ready to help teens realize how important they really are. Please pick up \"THUG\". You will not regret it."}, {"userName": "Kai", "userReviewDate": "Mar 03, 2017", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/41788524-kai", "userReview": "\u201cWhat's the point of having a voice if you're gonna be silent in those moments you shouldn't be?\u201dEvery white person on this planet needs to read this book.\"Lack of opportunities. Corporate America don't bring jobs to our communities, and they damn sure ain't quick to hire us. Then, even if you do have a high school diploma, so many schools in our neighbourhoods don't prepare us well enough. Our schools don't get the resources to equip you. It's easier to find some crack than it is to find a good school around here.Now think 'bout this. How did the drugs even get in our neighborhood? This is a multibillion-dollar industry. That shit is flown into our communities but I don't know anybody with a private jet.Drugs come from somewhere, and they're destroying our community.You got folks like Brenda, who think they need them to survive, and then you got the Khalils, who think they need to sell them to survive. The Brendas can't get jobs unless they're clean, and they can't pay for rehab unless they get jobs. When the Khalils get arrested for selling drugs, they either spend most of their life in prison, another billion-dollar industry, or they have a hard time getting a real job and probably start selling drugs again.That's the hate they're giving us, a system designed against us. That's Thug life.\"This book opened my eyes. I don't want to say too much, but I love how popular this book is, being No. 1 on the NYT bestseller list and already having cast Amandla Stenberg as the lead actress in the movie adaption. We need this, America needs this, YA fiction needs this. Angie Thomas gets so many things right, and so many readers can learn about black culture, cultural appropriation, covert and internalized racism and so much more through this.Apart from that, this book is simply good. It could be a biography, that's how realistic it feels. The characters have depth, the plot isn't overly dramatic but still exciting. And honestly, it's so so hilarious. Doesn't matter if the characters are joking about Voldemort or getting their butts whooped by their parents, it's laugh-out-loud material. The first few pages might be a little difficult to get through because it takes a while to get used the writing and the slang, but it's worth to keep going, believe me. The thing is, I wasn't overly emotional while reading this. I didn't cry ugly tears or had my heart broken. This is no TFIOS. But it's real and it's perfect.Another thing I love is when authors turn out to be huge Potterheads. There is nothing I enjoy more than a good Harry Potter reference, or five.Find more of my books on Instagram"}, {"userName": "Lola  Reviewer", "userReviewDate": "Dec 15, 2016", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/14596170-lola-reviewer", "userReview": "\u2018\u2018A hairbrush is not a gun.\u2019\u2019\nThis doesn\u2019t make any sense. And I hope that to you, too, it will not make any sense.Starr may only be sixteen, but she has already witnessed two murders in her life: the first of a young black girl in a drive by and the second of a young black boy shot multiple times by a cop.While she was in the car. Even though they didn\u2019t do anything wrong. Even though he was unarmed. \n\u2018\u2018A hairbrush is not a gun.\u2019\u2019\nDoes that make any sense to you? You can\u2019t just kill someone because, to you, they look threatening. Are you a seer? Can you predict that they will reach for a gun and kill you with it?No, you cannot. (Even then it wouldn\u2019t be completely right.) You have no right to take an innocent life like that. Inspired by the Black Lives Matter movement, this important novel tackles issues of race in society involving the black community of people and authority figures, more precisely, police officers.Starr was never taught to fear cops, but she was taught to be smart around them. Do what they ask, even if what they ask for makes no sense.But because of what has happened to her childhood friend Khalil, she becomes scared. Scared enough to speak up about what she witnessed, though? Will she gather her courage to do what is right?\n\u2018\u2018A hairbrush is not a gun.\u2019\u2019\nThis story needed to be told. It has been told orally and on paper many times before, unfortunately, but it was time someone wrote a book dealing with social issues of race like the ones here for a young audience.For young people are dying. Young black people. Black boys. Black girls.This novel educates. It may be fictional in the sense that Angie Thomas created this story using fictional characters, but what happens in it is scary real. It does feel like it was written for white folks, but it sure as hell didn\u2019t need to be written for black ones specifically. \n\u2018\u2018A hairbrush is not a gun.\u2019\u2019\nBlog | Youtube | Twitter | Instagram | Google+ | Bloglovin\u2019"}, {"userName": "Hailey (HaileyinBookland)", "userReviewDate": "Feb 24, 2017", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/21937982-hailey-haileyinbookland", "userReview": "This was such a heartbreakingly honest account of what is happening in America right now.

Inspired by the Black Lives Matter movement, this book takes you into the heart of Garden Heights after the main character has witnessed the wrongful murder of her best friend Khalil by a police officers. Being Canadian, as well as being white, I have the privilege of not having to deal with any of the things Starr deals with on a day to day basis but the experience of being alongside her as she grappled with the injustice of it all gave me a completely new understanding of what is going on in America.

Because every single review I've seen of this book is 4 stars or above and showers it in seemingly endless praise. When it seems like you're the only person in the world who didn't like a book, reviewing it can be a little intimidating.Also, this book focused on an incredibly sensitive topic nowadays - racism. Now, before I start making my points and telling you why I didn't like a book that is supposedly anti-racism, when I, myself, am anti-racist, let's go over the definition of \"racism.\" According to the dictionary, racism is the prejudice, discrimination, or antagonism directed against someone of a different race based on the belief that one's own race is superior.If someone works at a coffeeshop and a customer comes in of a different race and they treat them badly, because of their race, that's racist. If someone says \"you're stupid because you're ___ (insert race here),\" that's racist. If someone thinks they're better than you simply because of the color of that person's skin, that's racism, folks.Now, if a person were to stop talking with someone because they felt uncomfortable with that person's skin color, wouldn't that be racism? Wouldn't treating someone with hostility just because of their race, something they can't help, and are born with, be racist? Then what, I ask you, is this:\n\u201cYou can\u2019t even tell me what\u2019s going on!\u201d\u201cYou\u2019re white, okay?\u201d I yell. \u201cYou\u2019re white!\u201dSilence.\u201cI\u2019m white?\u201d he says, like he\u2019s just hearing that for the first time. \u201cWhat the f***\u2019s that got to do with anything?\u201d\nThe person who said \"you're white,\" who has no other reason besides this prejudice to be angry and stop talking to a white person, is Starr Carter, the narrator of this supposedly anti-racist book.After Starr's black friend, Khalil, is unjustly shot by a white police officer, Starr immediately zeroes in on the fact that the police officer was white. Suddenly every white person looks evil to her and she worries that she, a black girl, could be killed next.\n\u201cI kneel beside my dead friend in the middle of the street with my hands raised. A cop as white as Chris points a gun at me.As white as Chris.\u201d\nNow, I love that this book focused on an unjust police shooting, but I think the author took a wrong turn when she decided to focus on \"blacks\" and \"whites.\" My question is: why was the police officer's skin color the main focus of this book? Shouldn't the fact that he's a police officer who unjustly shot somebody be the reason for Starr getting so angry about her friend's death? Black people are unjustly shot by police officers, yes, but so are white people. To quote a good article about the statistics of police shootings that you can read here:\n\u201c\u2026When a black man is killed by a cop, do we grieve more because there are 46 million of us as opposed to 198 million whites? I doubt it: most Americans never hear about the white men\u2019s deaths at all.Rather, we operate according to a meme under which cops casually kill black men under circumstances in which white men are apparently let off with a hand slap\u2014and occasional cases of just that are what often get around social media, suggesting that they are the norm.\u201d\nIt is not normal for a black person to be killed by a police officer, and when the officer won't own up to his mistake (like the one in this book), I am fully supportive of whatever non-violent protesting people want to do. What I won't support is the slogan that gets slapped on alongside these riots: All police officers hate black people or All white people are racist and should own up to their \"white guilt.\" These statements are ludicrous and this book sent out both of those messages loud and clear.*takes deep breath and prepares for the onslaught of comments coming my way*Now that I'm done talking about the message, I can tell you what I thought about the book itself: It was boring. Seriously. I expected a fast-paced contemporary, but the plot was slow and the characters weren't developed enough for me to connect with them. With such weak writing, The Hate U Give could have been about rainbows and unicorns and I still would have given it two stars."}, {"userName": "maymay\u2740", "userReviewDate": "Mar 04, 2017", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/49148508-maymay", "userReview": "[ when Starr, her brother, Seven, her boyfriend, Chris, and DeVante were at Garden Heights in the middle of a riot  (hide spoiler)]"}, {"userName": "softlykaz (on hiatus)", "userReviewDate": "Apr 25, 2017", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/42130592-softlykaz-on-hiatus", "userReview": "When you're reading books like The Hate U Give, you're truly reading someone's brave decision against silence. This book has made me feel every single possible emotion at the same time. It was truly incredible and I have SO MUCH to say about it I wish I could actually just send everyone a howler containing the entire script of this book instead.\n\u201cWhat's the point of having a voice if you're gonna be silent in those moments you shouldn't be?\u201d\nIn all honesty, The Hate U Give has made me realize just how simply clueless I was as to the continuing day-to-day actuality of systemic racism in America. A reality in which on any given day, some innocent person like Tommy Le can get shot hours before his high-school graduation because he was carrying a pen, or another innocent person like Sandra Bland can get into a car, and then three days later she is going to end up dead in jail, or  a five years old child can get shot and wounded after the police kills his mother. A reality in which justice is dead and the police kills black youth with impunity.And so many other real stories I read about that truly made the atoms making up my body have enough of being anchored to this awful reality in this human form and wish to move on, become a light wave or something.See, I don\u2019t know what it's like to be black in America, but I have 18 years of experience in being a brown Muslim woman and I can tell you this: being in the minority is like being stuck behind a glass wall and whenever an injustice occurs, you breathe onto it and you write it in HUGE letters in the condensation...but nobody seems to really see it. Nobody seems to really see you. You\u2019re completely and utterly alone.(x)The Hate U Give is about institutional racism and a broken criminal justice system where the police can violate the civil rights of thousands of people publicly and openly with almost no consequence at all. It's about what happens when racialized and marginalized communities stand up for their rights in any visible way whatsoever. It\u2019s about how piles and piles of evidence showing sustained corruption and racism and literally hundreds of civilian deaths per year at the hands of the police is still somehow not enough to delegitimize a deeply flawed system.It's about how instead of standing in unwavering solidarity with the non-violent protests by Black Lives Matter in the face of actually violent, overtly discriminatory and often fatal actions by the police and demanding societal redress and justice, there will always be people who will decry and get enraged by it, people who will try to justify those injustices by any means to curb their own cognitive dissonance. \n\u201cA hairbrush is not a gun.\u201d \nI mean, this is the 21st century. We evolved. America had elected its first black president. Humanity must've left \u2018racism\u2019 back up in the trees from the jungles we descended from.... right?Maybe there just aren't many \u201csocial experiments\u201d on YouTube where privileged folks get to dress up like oppressed groups and have cameras following them around in order to find out that racism is real, since apparently you really need the personal account of a white non-Muslim girl who tries on a hijab for a week to find out that racism and islamophobia do indeed exist, or a straight person pretending to be gay to find out that homophobia does exist, or an able-bodied person pretending to be disabled to find out that ableism does exist.You don't need any \u201csocial experiments\u201d to understand oppression. You don\u2019t need to plagiarize lived experiences when you can just listen. Not to the personal accounts filtered through a white person but listen to the testimonials of all the people of color across the globe who experience these issues first hand - no matter what their socio-economic standing is, and who are ignored when they actually reach out to educate you even though they shouldn't even have to. No one should have to debate about whether or not they should have basic human rights. No one should be expected to be the mouth piece for an entire group. No one should have to defend their humanity at every single step, repeatedly and constantly. But racism does exist.And I don't usually comment on other people's reviews, but if you\u2019ve read this book and chose to ignore the important message it conveys to get offended over the main character\u2019s remark about the way white people call 'target' tar-jay and \u201chey hey that\u2019s racist!\u201d because you think a harmless joke could possibly equate thousands of black lives unjustly killed every year at the hands of the police, or say \u201cbut what if it was the other way around?\" when you have zero concept of power dynamics and historical context, you are missing the point.Now you can justify your outrage by bringing up the definition of racism like I\u2019ve seen so many people do, but I don\u2019t think dictionary definitions will help you there when they are the most basic forms of words and often can\u2019t even be taken in a sociological sense. Just like how they won\u2019t help with the usual cries of \u2018reverse racism\u2019 or even the moronic nonsense like trying to claim that anti-Islamic bigotry is not racist because \u201cIslam is not a race\u201d. It won\u2019t change the fact that members of marginalized groups suffer under the yoke of all forms of social inequality, from racism to misogyny to ableism to so much more on a daily basis. It won't change the fact that these words are a constant, inevitable factors of the lives of the minority, all found on different levels of existence, all carrying various levels of trauma.I think Scott Woods said it best when he said that racism is bigger than just \u201cconscious hate\u201d. That it might look like hate but it is just one manifestation. And privilege is another. Access is another. Ignorance is another. Apathy is another. \n\u201cYou can destroy wood and brick, but you can't destroy a movement.\u201d \nKhalil's story is one I will never forget, just like I won't forget all the real stories this book has opened my eyes to.(x)"}, {"userName": "Adam Silvera", "userReviewDate": "Mar 01, 2016", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/4050629-adam-silvera", "userReview": "GET READY, WORLD!"}, {"userName": "Sabaa Tahir", "userReviewDate": "Sep 16, 2016", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/26226276-sabaa-tahir", "userReview": "A thoughtful, honest and fantastic book.

Just wow.In my life so far, I've had the opportunity to experience many different things, but there are certain things I'll never get/have to experience. For example, I'll never experience childbirth, not that I'm complaining, although I once had a cortisone shot in my hip flexor, and my orthopedist said she thought those hurt just as badly. (You can debate on that.)I'm also fortunate enough that I'll never have to worry about the police viewing me as a threat as soon as they see me, just because of the color of my skin. I'll never have to think about the possibility of a routine traffic stop turning into something more dangerous just because a policeman gets nervous. That's something I take for granted, but I won't now that I've read Angie Thomas' searing, powerfully moving \nThe Hate U Give\n.Starr is 16 years old. She feels like there are two of her\u2014the devoted daughter who lives in a poor neighborhood and saw her best friend get killed in a drive-by shooting when they were 10, and the student at the fancy prep school her parents sent her and her brothers to in order to get them out of the ghetto, the student who doesn't speak the way she does at home, and lets very few people into her \"real world.\" Even her boyfriend at school, Chris, with whom she watches reruns of \nThe Fresh Prince of Bel-Air\n doesn't know the \"real\" Starr, although he says he wants to.\"Funny how it works with white kids though. It's dope to be black until it's hard to be black.\"One night while Starr is at a party in her neighborhood, she runs into her childhood friend Khalil. Khalil was her first crush, and although she hasn't seen him for a while, it feels good to reconnect. When a fight breaks out at the party, the two leave before things get out of hand. Not long afterward, police pull Khalil's car over, and before they know it, Khalil gets shot and killed by the cop. He was unarmed.Khalil's death throws Starr and her family into a tailspin. The media has already branded Khalil a drug dealer and a thug. Starr doesn't feel like she can tell her friends at school what happened because that would be exposing them to a part of her she has tried to keep hidden, but she is angered by the attitude of one of her friends toward Khalil's shooting. Starr is afraid of the ramifications of telling the truth of what happened that night to police, prosecutors, everyone\u2014what if police target her family? What if others think she should just keep her mouth shut? And will speaking up make the difference anyway, if most of the time white cops don't pay the price for shooting black people?\"I've tweeted RIP hashtags, reblogged pictures on Tumblr, and signed every petition out there. I always said that if I saw it happen to somebody, I would have the loudest voice, making sure the world knew what went down. Now I am that person, and I'm too afraid to speak.\"Starr's involvement in Khalil's death uncovers friction in a number of places\u2014between her parents, who argue about the merits of getting their family out of their neighborhood versus their responsibility to making sure it doesn't die; between her father and his nemesis, the leader of a powerful gang, who is intertwined with Starr's family in too many different ways; between her and Chris, as well as her friends at school; and between the factions of their neighborhood and others in the community, some who riot for the sake of rioting and don't care what destruction they cause, and some who understand the power of their actions.\nThe Hate U Give\n is tremendously moving and just so current given what is happening in our society. While certainly it focuses on police brutality and the anger minorities feel when the authorities don't get punished for doing wrong, it is quick to point out that not all police are bad, just as not all black people are drug dealers, gang members, or looking to do harm. This is a book about racism, but it's also a book about family, friendship, loyalty, community, and how often it truly does take a village to save someone. This is a book that addresses the plight that many young black men face, but it doesn't place the blame on anyone but them, either.I thought Thomas did a great job with this book, making sure it wasn't too heavy-handed in its messaging or too extreme in its plot. She created characters you grew to care about, characters you were invested in, so when pivotal events occurred, you were moved by them. This really blew my mind, and I think this is a book which really deserves all of the hype it is getting.Several times in the book Starr's mother uttered the quote, \"Sometimes you can do everything right and things will still go wrong. The key is to never stop doing right.\" I hope \nThe Hate U Give\n reaches those despairing whether doing the right thing is still worth it even if it doesn't get the result they want.

This book is inspired by the #BlackLivesMatter movement, where sixteen-year-old Starr witnesses her best friend, who is an unarmed black boy, be killed by a police officer. Starr is scared to speak up, constantly battling what to do, because there is never any justice for these heartless killings. This book is real, honest, and it's going to make a lot of people uncomfortable, but being uncomfortable is necessary to change. And this book is going to change a lot of people's lives. I hope everyone reads this and starts educating themselves on, and will stop ignoring, the problems going on in today's world. Books are the most powerful and influential tool we have, and The Hate U Give is a literary masterpiece that will be a constant reference for years to come. \n\n\u201cThat's the problem. We let people say stuff, and they say it so much that it becomes okay to them and normal for us. What's the point of having a voice if you're gonna be silent in those moments you shouldn't be?\u201d\n\n\nImportant things that I want to say: \n\u2022 Reverse racism doesn't exist. \u2022 White people will never know what it feels like to be a marginalized black person who is still being oppressed in 2017. You might think you do, but you don't. \u2022 When you say #AllLivesMatter, even when coming from a place of good, it is hurtful and ignoring the greater problems that are prevalent. \u2022 When you say #BlueLivesMatter it actually makes me feel sick to my stomach, especially after reading this book. Stop doing this. I don't care if your dad is \"one of the good cops out there\"; it is disrespectful for this plague of an epidemic that is happening to our black men and women. \u2022 I can do better and I can do more. We can do better and we can all do more.\u2022 Here is a list of some unarmed black men that have been killed over the past few years by the police brutality that is ever growing in the United States: Trayvon Martin, Michael Brown, Eric Garner, Dontre Hamilton, Eric Garner, John Crawford III, Michael Brown Jr., Michael Brown Jr., Dante Parker, Akai Gurley, Tamir Rice, Rumain Brisbon, Jerame Reid, Tony Robinson, Phillip White, Eric Harris, Walter Scott, Freddie Gray, Keith Lamont Scott, Philando Castile, Alton Sterling, and more that go unnamed and unanswered every day. Remember these names. Honor these names. Open your eyes. See what is going on in our world and see how wrong it is. It is easy to ignore when it is not happening to you, but is this really the kind of world you want to live in? Open your heart; be empathetic to your fellow human. Let's change this, and have The Hate U Give be the first stepping stone. \n\n\u201cYou can destroy wood and brick, but you can't destroy a movement.\u201d\n\nThank you, Angie Thomas; I truly hope your book changes this world. Lastly, I want to emphasize that this review is coming to you from a young, white, immensely privileged woman. These are five amazing people of color giving amazing heartfelt reviews on YouTube that showcases why this book is the most important and influential book of our time.

My typical days are like boot camp lately -walking between 7-10 miles a day -PLUS an hour circuit weight resistance class ( 4 mile walk to class from my house) -- then I often walk to a cafe - eat & drink something - check-in with Goodreads -- try to touch base with this community- a few 'one-on- one' chatting exchanges--during my sitting break.Sometimes I try to talk into the phone while I walk. Typos exposed! Before walking to my weight residence class - I'm often at the gym at 5 AM-- a few weights & stretching to begin - then an hour to 90 minutes of cardio 'while' reading from my paper white - BEFORE THAT....I've read in bed a few hours 'before' the gym....Exhausted yet? For relaxation-- I've added back an OLD FARTS YOGA CLASS.....AN EASY CLASS .... much too easy for me --but it's perfect! The breathing alone and time for inner blessings -private time to experience being 'one' with the world - hoping to be a better person, is worth the extra time spent in class. I send out blessings to family & friends while I'm in my own space on my own yoga mat. ( very private & personal but real for me).... Why am I sharing this? I retired from traditional reviews--- but I may write a few NON- TRADITIONAL REVIEWS as my way to feel connected with people here I love and am forever thankful for!!! After receiving the crappy diagnosis of osteoporosis on July 3rd this year --I knew I had to make changes. Take the yucky medication - and not fight it.. GET THE CORRECT AMOUNT OF CALCIUM in my diet not under-eat... and get out of the chair. Writing reviews that take an hour or more won't build bone density. So-- I started downloading as many audiobooks I could get my hands on - free- from the library overdrive. I paid for a few too. Getting ready for walking- moving daily boot camp - reading included. When I finished \"The Hate U Give\".... taking my turn at this book, which I recommend everyone take THEIR TURN, ....I still had about 1 more mile walk home. I was DYING TO CONNECT WITH MY DAUGHTERS. This book did that to me. So.... HOW DOES A MOM CONNECT WITH THEIR ADULT KIDS WHEN THEY ARE HUNDREDS OF MILES AWAY - and they can't talk at the moment? Perfect solution: play music that reminds you of them!!!So-- I immediately listen to Aerosmith, \"Don't Want to Miss A Thing\", from Armageddon---Ali insisted on playing that song as her 'opening song' at her Bat Mitzvah.....nothing Jewish about it!- and we have a luv/thing with Aerosmith together. For Katy - I played \"Someone Else's Story\" from the Broadway Musical \"Chess\". It's such a beautiful song ( listen to it). Katy use to sing it often! She always brings tears to my eyes when she sings it. Her voice is beautiful. And how does ANY OF THIS RELATE TO \"The Hate You Give\"? I have no idea ....other than all these emotions - thoughts & feelings ARE ASSOCIATED with THIS BOOK.Somehow they are all tied together!!!!I'll leave you with one sentence in this book that - for me - represents the context of this beautiful- heartbreaking story.  \"A Good Garden Needs A Good Conversation\". 5 Strong stars!!! I vote the audiobook!"}, {"userName": "Candace", "userReviewDate": "Jun 30, 2017", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/16384209-candace", "userReview": "After reading this book, I can certainly see what all the uproar is about. 'The Hate U Give' addresses the very sensitive issues of race relations and police brutality in a time when the nation is torn over these issues. Most of my friends are at one extreme or the other when it comes to the #Blacklivesmatter movement. Since I don't want to incite an online mobbing, I'm going to do my best to avoid that movement specifically, while sharing my thoughts and opinions on this wonderful book.First of all, this is a very moving story. It centers on a teenage black girl, Starr Carter, who leaves her crime-riddled neighborhood each day to attend an affluent school across town. In both settings, she feels a need to conform to the social norms. This means that she lives a double-life of sorts -- she has one persona with her black family and friends in her neighborhood and another one with her wealthy, predominantly white, friends from her school. One night she attends a party in her neighborhood that turns violent. After leaving the party with her childhood friend, Khalil, her life and her community is forever changed. A routine traffic stop turns tragic when an unarmed Khalil is repeatedly shot by a police officer after failing to follow police instructions. The events of that night serve as the spark that sets off an explosion. Starr's neighborhood has a long-standing animosity for the police, citing multiple instances of police brutality and harassment. The death of Khalil is only the latest in a long line of atrocities.Begrudgingly, Starr is forced into the center of a media feeding frenzy. Part of her wishes that she could just hide and return to her \"old\" life, while another part wants to be brave and stand up for what she believes is right. She was in an extremely difficult situation for a young girl. Although she initially tries to remain anonymous, as the sole witness of Khalil's murder she eventually speaks out publicly. Doing so, Starr learns a lot about herself and the people that she surrounds herself with. Some will stick around to support her, others will reveal that they were never really who she thought they were.While this book certainly highlighted the issue of police brutality against blacks, there were several other takeaways for me. I applaud the author for not shying away from other issues that are controversial. For example, racism - against multiple races - was prevalent throughout this story. I appreciated that the author was forthcoming in addressing this topic, even knowing that it would likely be controversial. Two wrongs don't make a right. Racism is still racism and it is wrong, regardless of the race.Although I did find the danger of Starr's neighborhood to be exaggerated, the author also highlighted the issue of violent crime, drugs and gang warfare. Several times, there were drive-by shootings or other crimes committed in Starr's neighborhood by the residents against the residents. It was sad and the author did a good job of highlighting this issue/cycle of violence. One notable, older man in the story commented on this and I couldn't have agreed with him more. There was a lot of senseless violence and crime in Starr's neighborhood. As he said, the government needn't look further than that neighborhood to find a real terrorist. The people lived in fear, not only of the police, but of the crime lord in their midst.The conflict in Starr's family over whether to stay in the neighborhood, despite the danger, or move to a safer neighborhood, also was enlightening. There were a lot of mixed feelings and a sense of betrayal that accompanied her parent's desire to \"better\" their situation and that of their children. It reminded me of that saying about crabs in a bucket, always trying to pull one back in before they can get out. There was certainly plenty of pressure and resentment, both within and outside of her family where this was concerned. They had to balance their desire to improve their situation against the repercussions of being viewed as sell-outs. The same was true for Starr's uncle, who was a police officer.Overall, this was a wonderful book. I'd definitely recommend it to others, regardless of their views. It provides plenty of food for thought and raises awareness of several important social issues."}, {"userName": "\u2606\u2665\u2606Kotyonok\u2665\u2606\u2665 ", "userReviewDate": "Aug 13, 2017", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/6713906-kotyonok", "userReview": "(NOTE: while doing some reflection, some of my opinions have changed and I think I need to reword this review. Not sure when I will)1. NO IT WAS NOT \u201ca very important book\u201d; it took an important issue and made it relatively black and white. Issues with cops will never be solved when presented in this 1-dimensional, one-sided, liberal-view point that relies ON FEELINGS AND IGNORES FACTS. For a REAL depiction of both sides that attempts to be fair and shows the REAL problem (that both sides just make generalizations and judge one another), SEE THIS MASTERPIECE: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=43gm3...2. It panders a lot to the SJW/BLM/white-guilt sentiment side. Quite literally all the white people in this book suck and/or are horrible. Except for the white guilt ally boyfriend \ud83d\ude09. 3. It was very well written, the story is very good and interesting, and it definitely kept me hooked and got a reaction out of me, so good for Angie Thomas. I think she\u2019s really talented. (See I always hear people say we need to support poc authors, just because they\u2019re poc, but I say NO to that, I will not support any author based on their skin color or sex or gender or whatever. I\u2019ll support them based on the words they write and how well they write them\u2014whether they\u2019re actually good at writing or not. I\u2019m not supporting someone just because they look like me\u2014I don\u2019t even agree with a lot Thomas wrote, but she is clearly a good writer and I\u2019ll buy her future books because SHE\u2019S TALENTED and let the book speak for itself rather than bitching endlessly on Twitter (cough cough LL MCKINNEY). 4. BLM is still cancer and if this book shows your brain on BLM, you\u2019re going to get arrested and be miserable for the rest of your life for thinking rioting and burning shit solves anything. If anything, this showed me even more how ridiculous BLM is \ud83d\ude02. BLM has done more harm than good in terms of racial relations and police relations, and has even caused an increase in crime in places like Chicago because police patrol less for fear of being called racist if they arrest a black person. Now that\u2019s not to say I don\u2019t think Black Lives Matter\u2014they do. Of course they do, and I think a movement like that could have done some serious good on police reform had it actually had a brain and instead of an SJW beating heart. I think it could have been a GREAT and NECESSARY MOVEMENT. But as it stands now, I can\u2019t support it. I\u2019m not trying to be unnecessarily harsh, but the movement needs desperate reform, if you can even call it a movement. It hasn\u2019t accomplished much...I think the police force COULD use some reform, and I can acknowledge police brutality exists, but the SJW/BLM solutions are wrong.The movement as it is now is misguided and runs on myths and lies. FACTS: Cops kill more whites, black kills more whites than whites kill blacks. If you want to talk about Black Lives Mattering, go fix your own damn communities first: over 90%+ of black deaths are caused by other black people. Why don't those lives matter? Where are the protests for those lives? Why are there only protests when it\u2019s a WHITE person killing a BLACK person? Where are the protests for the drive-by shootings, the low graduation rates, the single motherhood rate, for the drug abuse in black communities? Don\u2019t start telling me the cops target you to kill you\u2014statistically and factually untrue. Really, where\u2019s White Lives Matter? Doesn\u2019t that make more sense? They get killed more! 5. I look forward to the movie.***6. It has come to my attention that a Texas school district has banned the book. Now while I didn't agree with this book, I hate censorship and book banning of any kind (unless for justified reasons, but as far as I can tell, the reasons given to banning this book are bullshit), so yes, I am against that ruling to ban the book. I may disagree with what this book says, but I'll defend it's right to say it.*** And no I\u2019m not white. I\u2019m not black either. The fact that i even need to say this just shows you how detrimental the SJW/BLM mindset is\u2014everything goes back to race, everything is justified or validated by race, every problem or privilege is because of race. And when in doubt: blame white people.Happy Triggering fellow shitheads \ud83d\ude08"}, {"userName": "R.K.

Starr's character was so well written that every time she had to interact with her high school friends I cringed at their responses. This is an incredibly powerful book, not just for its political message but for the internal conflict Starr is struggling with. The story was so much deeper than that initial conflict, it really dug into who Starr is and why she feels guilty even though the reader is screaming at the pages \"You have nothing to feel badly about! You did nothing wrong!\"Though I know there are other authors out there with stories like this to tell, it's so great to see this sort of coming of age story receive the commercial success it has.

You can feel prejudiced or discriminated against, but don\u2019t call it racism.I\u2019m a biracial person - hi my dad\u2019s family\u2019s from Vietnam. And as a biracial person I found this book quite hard to read sometimes mostly because of all the comments on interracial relationships. But now again, the way I have to deal with racism isn\u2019t the same way Black people have to deal with it, so obviously the way I react to this book won\u2019t be the same as Black people do. So yes, I see - but still condemn - why white people - mostly - weren\u2019t happy about some subjects of this book, but then again guys, this book isn\u2019t about you, it\u2019s not about how you feel about the BLM movement, not about how you feel \u2018insulted\u2019 by a Black man saying he doesn\u2019t trust White people, it\u2019s about what White racist people created throughout the years. YES I felt uncomfortable while reading the comments about interracial relationships in this book but YES I realize it has nothing to do with me - because this book isn\u2019t about my culture - and YES if a Black person tells you you\u2019re being racist you have every right - you\u2019re even encouraged - to shut the hell up because I think they know what racism looks like.Also, to everybody who says racism isn\u2019t a thing anymore \u2026. how dare you ? How dare you ?! Racism is everywhere, I don\u2019t care if you believe it or not, but it is. Racism is taught to us from kindergarten, when someone makes fun of somebody else\u2019s accent, of someone else\u2019s culture, it\u2019s EVERYWHERE so stop saying it doesn\u2019t exist anymore. It does. And people are killed in the name of racism, and they never get the justice they deserve, because YES racism is still a thing, even nowadays in our so called \u2018advanced society\u2019. Racism, racism, racism, RACISM. Get used to this word because it\u2019s a reality for a lot of us.And this book shows exactly what I\u2019m talking about, and I was mad while reading it because it hurts to see some people are still so blind, and ignorant, and mean.I also would like to talk about something, because if you don\u2019t know this I\u2019m French and policemen in my country don\u2019t have guns, so I\u2019m not all that familiar - and I\u2019m grateful - with people being killed because they\u2019re people of colour. But unfortunately we\u2019re familiar with people being beaten up sometimes for NOTHING but the medias will always find something to defend the cops who did something wrong. Every single time. If an innocent man gets punched or worse by a policeman, I don\u2019t give a fuck if he sells drugs or anything else, I just don\u2019t care, but what I care about is that this man is basically being told that it\u2019s his fault if the policeman reacted this way. And in this book people say it\u2019s okay if Khalil\u2019s dead because he\u2019s a drug dealer and he would have died anyway \u2026 but in what world do we live ? People get MURDERED on assumptions and then it\u2019s their fault ? How the fuck does this sound right to you ?This book is EXTREMELY important. If you think it\u2019s overhyped, then it means there is a problem with you, because this book isn\u2019t. This book is about the truth, the ugly truth. And I liked that it\u2019s explicitly said that all cops aren\u2019t bad cops, all cops aren\u2019t like the one who killed Khalil, because that is important to remember. And the interracial couple was well done. Yes Chris and Starr were cute, but that wasn\u2019t just that. Chris is respectful, he doesn\u2019t try to \u2018steal\u2019 Starr\u2019s culture, but he does everything to understand her and learn from his mistakes. And so does Starr.It would be so easy to quit if it was just about me, Khalil, that night, and that cop. It's about way more than that though. It's about Seven. Sekani. Kenya. DeVante.It's also about Oscar.Aiyana.Trayvon.Rekia.Michael.Eric.Tamir.John.Ezell.Sandra.Freddie.Alton.Philando.It's even about this little boy in 1955 who nobody recognized at first - Emmett.The messed-up part ? There are so many more.Yet I think it'll change one day. How ? I don't know. When ? I definitely don't know. Why ? Because there will always be someone ready to fight.

Khalil was an unarmed black boy gunned down by a white police officer. At its core this is a story we've all heard before. It's a story we're seeing an alarming amount of the time on the news these days. It's a story that is powerful & tragic & relevant.What I enjoyed most about this book was its honest portrayal of modern issues among black communities, and how largely unaware we who are outside of those communities can be. There are a lot of hot topic ideas presented here.~How both drug and prison industries are designed to keep minorities in a revolving door of failure. ~How the media unabashedly contaminates our ideas about reality. ~How the people paid to protect us don't always consider all of us worth protecting.~How racism is intentional at times. How racism is unintentional at times. How racism is destructive all of the time.~How death isn't something we think about until it affects someone we know personally.\"Her words used to have power. If she said it was fine, it was fine. But after you've held two people as they took their last breaths, words like that don't mean shit anymore.\"I think this book has all the elements necessary to make a resounding point; a compelling narrative, believable characters, excellent writing, and an insightful voice can all be found here. This is quite an accomplishment for a debut author, especially given the content she chose to tackle.It addresses those ugly manifestations of hatred, but it also shines a light on the hope we must have for the future.My own personal fear is that those of us who desperately need to read a story like this will not be the ones racing to pick it up.

It is so important and SO good. I cannot stress this enough. Anything I say won't even do the book justice. Just know this is a standout novel that will take the world by storm. It is the best book I have read in years by far. I cannot recommend it enough.Inspired by the Black Lives Matter movement, it confronts issues of race and class sending an incredibly powerful message to readers. I cannot help but feel thankful that there is finally a novel that does what  The Hate U Give does. This is a book that holds such importance, relevance and complete honesty. It is also an undeniably beautiful story about a teenage girl with very real, complex relationships.Sixteen year old Starr is witness to the shooting of her best friend Khalil by a police officer. Khalil was unarmed and doing absolutely nothing wrong. The media gains interest in the shooting where they are portraying Khalil as if he did something wrong to deserve it. The police don't seem interested in finding out what really happened. Starr is scared to speak up about what she witnessed. Will she find her voice for Khalil?What makes this especially interesting is Starr lives two very different lives: one in Garden Heights with her family in the mostly black community and one at her fancy mostly white school Williamson Prep. At school Starr has a white boyfriend, friends, and dials back who she is by talking differently and acting slightly different as if to seem \"less black.\" It broke my heart seeing Starr living two completely separate lives hiding who she is. Starr is a very believable protagonist.The message is extremely important. I myself am inspired and want to do something. This is a book that is exceptionally great. It will make you feel things.

You will, too!Plenty of others have done a great job summarizing the story, so I won't waste your time with a synopsis. But you should know that this book transported me - I cared so deeply about the characters that it was disorienting when I lifted my eyes from the page. This is an OUTSTANDING novel. I predict it will go down as one of the top titles of 2017. I bow deeply with all respect to Angie Thomas - the craft and imagination and heart she wove into this masterpiece is breathtaking. Run, don't walk, to your bookseller or library and get your copy now."}, {"userName": "Donalyn", "userReviewDate": "Mar 21, 2017", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/829035-donalyn", "userReview": "Reread.
