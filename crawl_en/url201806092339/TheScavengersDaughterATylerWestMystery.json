Luckily for him, there\u2019s a medieval serial killer on the loose in San Diego, and Ty is uniquely situated to get all the scoops. With some serious perseverance and a bit of luck, everything seems to be going his way. But things can change in an instant. Chasing down this story may be the most dangerous story of his career, and one false move means Ty stands to lose everything that\u2019s ever mattered to him.A former columnist himself, the author seems to know his way around newspaper business (love the \u201cWheaties test\u201d). The characterization in this book is well done, and the richness of the detail serves to pull the reader into the story. In fact, I\u2019m a little frightened of the author, due to the impeccable research he\u2019s put into the character of Friar Tom. The information about the instruments of torture is exquisite, and really adds to the storyline. Somehow, the author manages to make such a wild storyline believable, and the result is a riveting, and frightening, tale. Told in both first person (Ty) and third person (Friar Tom), it\u2019s easy to follow the plot as it builds to its inevitable conclusion.This was a book I found really difficult to put down. I began reading it on Sunday morning, and I could hardly be parted from my reader all day long until I finished the book. It was engrossing and well- written. I\u2019m a big fan of Michael Connelly\u2019s books, and I think Ty West may be Harry Bosch\u2019s biggest competition. The twists in the story were easy to follow, and I never was lost or confused about what had happened.Originally posted @ GraceKrispy's MotherLode review blog"}, {"userName": "Breia", "userReviewDate": "Feb 03, 2012", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/2736850-breia", "userReview": "This is the best free book I have picked up from Amazon. This novel is the author\u2019s first fiction work and I thought it was very well done. The suspense and drama/horror (though I would not categorize this as horror at all) is spot on. Though you know who the killer is about half way through, I still could not put it down. I had to know why and when and disturbingly enough, what. I am rating this 4.5 stars only because I felt the conversation parts were a bit off.This would be a great beginning to a series and the author is certainly talented enough to make it happen. This is free with Amazon Prime right now (or $3.99 \u2013 definitely worth it) so if you are into serial killers, pick this up.

A combination thriller/mystery/horror, this book starts out with a gripping prologue and launches straight into action with the first of its high-profile victims. McIntyre spares us no mercy in the vivid detail he gives of each torture method inflicted on his victims.

Investigative reporter, Tyler West continually defies the police in a desperate search for the sadomasochist, Friar Tom, before he loses everything that matters to him.The Scavengers Daughter is an involved, complicated plot expertly woven together to create a fantastic, suspenseful read. The chapters are short, the pace is fast and furious, and the reader is immediately hooked right up to the end. The characters are realistic, well developed and likable, even with their flaws.

Frustrated by police and city leaders who insist the murders aren\u2019t related, Tyler digs deeper and uncovers the common thread that nobody expects.

It was fast-paced and never apparent what was coming next. At times, it seemed everyone was working against Tyler, which brought out my natural instinct to root for the underdog.

Such is the premise of \"The Scavenger's Daughter\" by Mike McIntyre. I am not a thriller afficionado, but I do have an idea on what I think a thriller should be: the language should be relatively simple (dense phrasing can slow things down), the pace needs to be break-neck (or at least needs to become faster as it progresses), the novel needs to quickly become `unputdownable'. So do I assess this novel as fitting these three criteria? Absolutely! I devoured \"The Scavenger's Daughter\" and was left at the end feeling like I'd just watched a thriller at the cinema. For an author of this genre I'm guessing this is pretty high praise. This novel does not break new ground and the plot is not highly original, but playing it safe has its advantages; why fix what ain't broke? The central character, previously acclaimed, now a bit down on his luck is trying to establish himself again as the investigative reporter du jour. Some seemingly unrelated stories put him on the trail of a sick serial killer. Happy circumstance gifts our hero with contacts in the FBI and forensics - both giving him a helping hand along the way which is quite convenient from a plot point of view. An assistant district attorney ex-girlfriend provides the extra depth and some scattered love scenes (tastefully written). The pacing was very well done. I was hitting the page turn button rapidly as the novel progressed and the shorter chapters only helped convince me to read \"just one more chapter\". This is exactly what you need in book of this genre so I would judge the author to have been very successful in this area. In a thriller, when the tension is at its peak and the hero needs that one piece of the puzzle to put everything into place, we come to our final revelation - that moment when we approach the resolution of the story. The Scavenger's Daughter had a number of revelations and pre-requisite false turns and crises that jeopardise the redemption of the main character. Some profiling from an FBI friend gave a somewhat over-accurate laundry list of serial killer characteristics to match suspects which I thought was a bit contrived, but the final piece of the puzzle was even more so and rather unlikely. It was the square peg hammered into the round hole to push the story to resolution in my mind and probably my main gripe in the novel. Given that the serial killer dispatches his victims with medieval torture instruments, one might expect some rather gruesome depictions of torture within the novel. Maybe I have a steel stomach, but I felt that the author was admirably restrained. General descriptions of the use of such instruments were furnished and would still allow the reader some uncomfortable visuals, but the narrative itself didn't become that blend of pornography and gore prevalent in some cult horror movies produced in the last few years. However, there was some license used in the depiction of at least one of the torture devices, the scavenger's daughter after which the novel was named. As I'd never heard of this device, I did some research of my own as I was curious how it achieved the effect described in the book. After some reading, I felt that the author had produced an amalgam of two different versions of the instrument used centuries ago. One version locked limbs and neck together but would not have had the rapid or acute effect described in the book and the other did not need to lock wrists, legs or neck into place to have the effect that was clearly being described within the book. It's a very small thing, but I'm not sure why the author danced with authenticity when it should have been just as easy to have used historical detail accurately. McIntyre does not blaze new trails and frankly does not need to with \"The Scavenger's Daughter\". It has that thriller movie feel that authors of this genre should covet, it sticks to a successful formula of character, pace and plot and it left me satisfied. I would definitely recommend this book to thriller lovers if you don't mind covering similar ground while you're enjoying the ride."}, {"userName": "Bradley Convissar", "userReviewDate": "Jul 22, 2011", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/4464763-bradley-convissar", "userReview": "I picked up Mike McIntyre's The Scavenger's Daughter based on several good reviews I read. And I'll admit, I enjoyed it.I tend to not read too many books in the thriller/mystery/suspense genres simply because I am overwhelmed with fantasy and horror books. But, I am a fan of Deaver's Lincoln Rhyme books and Preston/Child's Pendergast books, I needed something to read on my Droid X, and it was only $.99 so I decided to give this book a try.The story was fast-paced and follows suspended, Pulitzer-prize winning journalist Tyler West as he tries to tack down the man who is murdering several rich and famous people in San Diego using medieval instruments of torture. The descriptions can be gruesome at times, as can be expected considering the contraptions used are quite gruesome, but the author never goes overboard with his descriptions. I will admit, though, while reading the book, I went online to view some of the awful devices. Hey, I'm a dentist. I love instruments of torture.Like I said earlier, I enjoyed the book. It was a quick, fun read, informational and engaging, with a likable and well-developed lead character. McIntyre paints a vivid picture of his location, int his case San Diego, which always helps the reader to put himself into the story. There were some events and circumstances that were a little too convenient and coincidental, needed to move the story ahead, but nothing too egregious to affect the story. Not plot holes, exactly, but a couple of logic jumps.My biggest gripe with the book is the length and how much the author tries to accomplish in the single book. Now, we all know that with the advent of digital publishing, page count has gone out the window. Now what matters is word count. Conventional wisdom says it is 250 words per page, but we all know that, when you count the number of words on an average printed book page, it is between 350 and 450, depending on the amount of dialogue. So if an eBook is 75,000 words, that can be converted to approximately 300 pages. But, if that same book were converted to print, it would only be around 250 pages.But I digress... I don't know how long The Scavenger's Daughter was, but it seemed on the short side. I felt that there could be more meat to it. More side stories. Now, McIntyre did set up a contentious relationship with the local police which can be, and I expect will be, explored in later books. But I thought the mythology of Tyler West's world could have been opened up and explored more. He finds a lost love who hates him at the beginning of the book and patches things up over a single novel. Now, their relationship is important to the plot, but I felt that maybe it could have taken two or three books for their relationship to heal. And if that meant that this had to be the 2nd or 3rd book in the series, then so be it. My next blog posting will actually be a short commentary on eBooks and length, so keep your eyes open for that.Anyway, these are all mild complaints which really won;t affect how much you enjoy the story. And for $.99, you get your money worth. Hell, this book is worth $2.99. And I will definitely pick up the next book in the series when it is released."}, {"userName": "Ken", "userReviewDate": "Feb 21, 2015", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/31585133-ken", "userReview": "The Scavenger\u2019s Daughter: A Tyler West Mystery by Mike McIntyre is a detective story, a reporter\u2019s story, a love story, a crime story, and a mystery. A serial killer is terrorizing San Diego, seemingly picking his victims at random. The twist is that the killer uses implements of medieval torture to dispatch his victims, upping the level of tension and suspense, and terrorizing the city. Tyler West, a Pulitzer prize winning journalist, watches his career and life circle the drain. He has lost touch with his girlfriend after spending several years in the Middle East reporting on those conflicts. The mayor, the police, and his publisher hate him for the exposure he has brought to high-level corruption in San Deigo. His publisher wants to get rid of him so much that he is assigned to the fashion beat at the art museum opening of a new exhibit. This is an exhibit of Medieval instruments of torture, where the mayor is the first to die. Having almost witnessed the murder, West sees an opportunity here to redeem himself by exposing the killer. But the police want him gone since they consider his investigative reporting to be interference in their investigation. Not helping matters is West\u2019s superior detective skills keeping him one step ahead of the police, who are not willing to listen to his theory of the case. Along the way West is reunited with his old girlfriend, and they tentatively restart their relationship where they left off years ago. West\u2019s investigation runs through a interesting cast of characters in the Art world, the Medieval history world, (and the Medieval torture world), any one of whom could be the killer. As the story develops we learn that these crimes may not be as clear cut as they seem, and the deaths only appear to be random. Mike McIntyre has previously written several travel books; this is his first fiction novel, and it is a worthwhile one. He builds the suspense throughout the story with believable situations and characters. Tyler West is a likeable guy who is beginning to realize his faults and do something about them. Looking over West\u2019s shoulder as he races after the killer is suspenseful and holds your attention through the end. This is one book that you will not want to put down. McIntyre also takes you into the mind of the killer, who is forced to counter West\u2019s moves through each crime and still not get caught. The story is a swift ride of twists and turns as tension builds towards the final act. Fans of crime and detective fiction will find this book highly rewarding."}, {"userName": "Babs", "userReviewDate": "May 04, 2011", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/1970552-babs", "userReview": "A Southern California self-storage unit filled with medieval instruments of torture\u2026A modern-day Torquemada hell-bent on updating the Spanish Inquisition\u2026An investigative reporter racing to connect the lurid dots\u2026Deadline has a whole new meaning.Tyler West, suspended Pulitzer Prize-winning reporter from the San Diego Sun, is desperate for a scoop that will save his career. Defying a spiteful publisher and a vindictive homicide detective, he investigates the baffling deaths of several of San Diego's powerful, rich and famous. Police call the murders unrelated, but Ty uncovers a common link: torture devices last used during the Dark Ages, including the Iron Maiden, the Pear of Anguish, and the most sinister of all\u2014the Scavenger's Daughter. Ty is plunged into a mysterious world of medieval torture scholars, antiquities collectors, museum curators, and sadomasochists. Aided by photojournalist Melina \"Mel\" Koric, a former Bosnian War refugee, Ty must break the brilliantly conceived series of slayings that has cast a dark shadow over a city better known for its sun, sand and surf. The elusive killer goes by the name Friar Tom, in tribute to his hero, Tom\u00e1s de Torquemada, the first Grand Inquisitor of the Spanish Inquisition. As Ty scrambles to unmask the monstrous zealot, he must juggle his investigation with his personal life: He pursues his lost love, Jordan Sinclair, an assistant district attorney, and continues to mentor inner-city kids at his youth golf clinics. With the city caught in an escalating nightmare of medieval mayhem, Ty is drawn into a lethal game of cat and mouse that could cost him everything. Lightning-paced, intricately plotted and wildly suspenseful, The Scavenger's Daughter grabs the reader early and doesn't let go until its heart-pounding climax.My 2 cents:Another great thriller, mystery and a touch of horror that will grip you from the beginning. Tyler will go to whatever he needs to do to save the people that are important to him. The book is faced paced and you will not want to put the book down.I liked the book for the vivid details from the author. He spares non of us from the tales.

Tyler West is a Pultizer prize winning newspaper writer whose investigation of several celebrity murders identifies a tenuous connection in the method of their death. His instincts are ignored by the police so Tyler follows up on his own, only to find himself a suspect, and the love of his life held hostage at the mercy of a madman.Tyler West is a fully realised character, once a golf pro who switched to journalism after his game faltered, his life has been a series of ups and downs. He struggles to balance his passion for reporting with his personal life and a tendency to pursue a story to the exclusion of all other considerations. McIntyre's first hand knowledge of the field provides an authenticity that grounds his protagonist but he doesn't neglect to round out West's character by exploring his vulnerabilities. His relationship with Jordan and her daughter, and the boys he mentor's, all contribute to creating a well developed and appealing lead.Ty's investigation leads him to the distorted mind of Friar Tom, whose obsession with medieval torture instruments, supports his taste for sadomasochism. The Scavenger's Daughter that the title refers to is a cruel torture device used by Tom\u00e1s de Torquemada, the first Grand Inquisitor of the Spanish Inquisition. It compresses the victim in such a way that their death is slow and agonizing. Friar Tom has several similar instruments at his disposal and delights in terrorizing the populace of San Diego with his horrifying crimes.Intricately plotted, fast-paced and exciting, The Scavenger's Daughter is a well crafted page-turner. I was impressed with the quality of the writing and thought the entire premise to be well executed. I'd favourably compare this novel with popular titles in the genre by established author's like Jeffrey Deaver.

And it delivered. Main character Tyler West is well-drawn and entirely believable as an investigative reporter who won't quit. Not surprisingly he has made enemies among some of the higher ups in his city--San Diego. Even the police don't like him or want to work with him. But someone is using Medieval torture implements to kill people and the police don't have a clue. Tyler West does, but the police won't believe him. The killer wants publicity and a worthy opponent and he quickly realizes Tyler West can provide both. The suspense starts right in the beginning and rarely lets up until the final page. This book was hard to put down. The author alternated between first person point of view from Tyler West's viewpoint and third person viewpoint from other characters. The viewpoint switches were skillfully handled and not a distraction and the book was well-plotted.
