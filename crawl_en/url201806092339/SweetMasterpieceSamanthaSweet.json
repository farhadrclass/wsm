Currently, she was doing her baking at home under less than ideal conditions. Until she saved enough money to accomplish that she worked part time for a government agency cleaning and maintaining homes that had gone into default. Her job was to get them into shape to be sold. \tOne day, she found a very ill, very unusual woman lying in bed in one of the houses. The woman gave Sam a box which she said had special powers, then she died. When she was mowing the yard at the next house, she discovered an unidentified grave. Both those finds play major roles in SWEET MASTERPIECE.\tHer new powers give her more energy and the ability to see things others cannot. The body in the grave is that of a recluse, an elderly man who turned out to have been a famous painter. The sheriff\u2019s department initially believes he may have died from pneumonia or another natural cause.\t\tWhile the book was a fast read and well-written, I found the plot to be very thin. There were some very good descriptions of various locations. It had a lot of filler material about making cakes and cupcakes (no recipes were provided) and an overview, repeated several times, of what Sam did to prepare a house. \tThe book has a lot of characters, primarily some of Sam\u2019s long-time friends. She talks about her daughter Kelly who cleaned out Sam\u2019s savings. Later the daughter returns but the story doesn\u2019t give enough details about why she quit her job or why she suddenly changed.\tAnother main character is the sheriff, Beau Cardwell. The relationship between him and Sam moves too quickly without explanation of Beau\u2019s motivation. \tOverall, I found the book to be boring because of all the surface attention given to Sam\u2019s jobs.\tIt might have made a better short story.\tThis book was a free Amazon download."}, {"userName": "Laurel", "userReviewDate": "Oct 22, 2014", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/23301973-laurel", "userReview": "Sam is a 50 year old, pudgy? heavy? stocky?

She was a likeable central character who presents a strong and positive image. I also liked the fact that she was in her 50's and working two jobs to pay her bills and save for her dream of owning her own bakery. I had never heard of her job for the government before I read this book. I found it fascinating that she broke into homes that people had defaulted on their government loans and walked away. She cleaned up these homes so that they could be sold at auction. This type of job added to this original plot because Sam had a \"real\" reason for being at the homes instead of just her being nosy (as so many other cozy mysteries characters).However, there were a couple of times during the story where Sam did do things that I call \"TSTL\" moments and they jolted me out of the story. I was shaking my head thinking \"why did she do that?\".This series is set in Taos, NM. I have visited there and loved the area. Her descriptions of the town and the surrounding area were so vivid that I was quite happy to \"see\" familiar spots that I had visited before.The secondary characters were really well developed and I enjoyed meeting them all. The handsome sheriff and his mother, Sam's daughter and Sam's friends helped to keep the plot moving. The story was interesting with enough twists and turns that kept me reading till the end. I look forward to the next book in this series."}, {"userName": "Jeanne Jenkins", "userReviewDate": "Feb 15, 2014", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/4785126-jeanne-jenkins", "userReview": "Sam Sweet moved to Taos New Mexico to start a new life.

Sentences desperately in need of editing. More random love stuff than mystery writing. Predictable plot. Anyway, I think you get the idea of what this book is like and about. A woman who wants to open a sweet shot (Sweet's Sweets, perhaps the most imaginative thought in the book) also cleans out abandoned houses to make extra money. In one of the abandoned houses she finds a dying woman who gives her a magical box. In the next house she finds a grave in the backyard and an amazing painting by a long missing artist. And then the local sheriff falls in love with her and her daughter who had walked off with all her money returns and becomes a saint. Is it the magical box or just lousy writing? Perhaps we will never know. Perhaps we will never care. I can at least give the book credit for being a fast read. Anyway, if you like mysteries then don't waste your time here.

I did enjoy it to some extent, but the writing style is very basic. The plot doesn't have much substance to it and there aren't many characters (but this does make it easy to follow). For a free book it is good, though.I like some of the ideas in it. One of these is a wooden box with Pagan symbols on, given to the protagonist by a dying lady, which seems to give her extrasensory powers. This is never really followed up or investigated though. There are a few mysteries and the main characters seem naive. The police and investigative service/Beau seemed to think that a place with an unrecorded burial in the backyard involving someone just wrapped in a blanket (no coffin) and a house with a mural, claiming to be painted by an important artist who had gone missing was not important to the investigation! And the mural was just cut out and passed on and sold. Weird.Sam also touches things of importance for the first time without gloves (the envelope and the hidden sketchbook which she forgot to tell the investigator about that she just stuffed under her mattress!) Many questions go unanswered.What caused the wooden box to give magical powers? Was there a limit on how often it should be used for this? Who really was the old woman? I don't believe Kelly was as genuine as she made out to be. Sam thought this to be out of character. I don't know if any of these things are followed up in future books in the series. At least it was easy to read and it did have promise but fell flat.This is definitely not one for murder mystery enthusiasts - it's too basic. If you want chick lit it pretty much falls flat on that front too. It has free narration too on amazon, the quality of which is very good and better quality than some of the other ebooks from amazon that came with audible narration (expressive, not too fast, not too thick an accent).Enjoyment: 7-8/10Quality 3/10"}, {"userName": "T K Nelson", "userReviewDate": "Jul 19, 2017", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/35590383-t-k-nelson", "userReview": "[ After the only likely suspect is eliminated, there is only one other person who has been introduced so it was a pretty easy leap to guess who the murderer was  (hide spoiler)]"}, {"userName": "April", "userReviewDate": "Feb 14, 2018", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/11213519-april", "userReview": "If you\u2019re looking for a brilliant piece of fiction, this book is not for you. It\u2019s fairly predictable - I\u2019m fighting the flu, and I had the mystery solved moments after finding out what the mystery was - and Samantha Sweet is the typical spunky middle-aged heroine who dreams of opening her own bakery and stumbles across a mystery. (Side note: why do spunky heroines almost always dream of opening/running either a bakery or coffee shop? Does my complete lack of desire for either a bakery or coffee shop doom me to an uneventful, non-spunky, unheroic life?) It\u2019s basically fluff... but for fluff, it\u2019s pretty decent. The author tried to introduce a mystical element to the book, but to be honest, that part felt a little forced... sort of like someone decided, \u201chey, we need a little something different to set Samantha Sweet apart from the other spunky, dreaming-of-a-bakery heroines, let\u2019s toss some random magic in there too.!\u201d I don\u2019t know if the \u201cmagic\u201d comes into play more in later books, but it didn\u2019t really work for me in this one. All in all, it was okay, and I\u2019ll likely pick up the next book next time I\u2019m between other reads.Also, side rant: I found it slightly annoying how often Sam \u201cwhips up\u201d an elaborate cake. Baking is fun, but it\u2019s work. The number of times Sam gets a last minute order and \u201cwhips up\u201d the perfect cake/cupcake/whatever... *especially* when that\u2019s in addition to the physically demanding cleaning/caretaking work she\u2019s doing... nope.
