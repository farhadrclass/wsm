", "userReviewDate": "Jul 07, 2010", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/3978225-carol", "userReview": "If ever there was a symphony as book (Beethoven's 8th?), it would be this one. Like a symphony, To Say Nothing is a wonderful composite that is almost impossible to deconstruct. In many books, there might be a chapter that stands out, whether due to brilliance or failure; this is largely a harmonious, excellently written whole, with only one or two incongruous passages near the end. Then there's the writing: amazingly developed and interwoven, it takes a number of disparate themes and juxtaposes them. Like a flute soaring above the rest of the orchestra, there are playful little giggles throughout, largely due to reoccurring motifs. Particular favorites include Ned's bemusement at hearing anarchoristic words (\"poppycock\" and \"drat\"), unfortunate couples that end in disaster, Ned's inability to read a Roman numeral pocket watch (\"I dozed off again at half past V\") and the fickleness of cats. There are serious undertones, and a sense of urgency; the characters need to achieve their personal mission, but are also extremely concerned about their detrimental impact on history. And, to be completely honest, like a symphony, one needs to be in the mood and willing to pay attention, otherwise it just becomes so much soporific background noise.The almost-impossible summary: in the year 2057, Lady Schrapnell (is there a more perfectly named character?) has come to England, determined to rebuild Coventry Cathedral, where her exponentially-great grandmother experienced a life-changing event. In her zeal, she's determined to make every detail perfect (\"God is in the details\") and has enlisted the Temporal Physics department of the University to make it happen. The story is told by temporal historian Ned Henry, who has most recently been in 1940, looking through the burned ruins of the Cathedral for the 'bishop's bird stump,' a hideous paragon to the lack of Victorian taste (\"It did, however, have twining ivy and a bas-relief of either Noah's ark or the battle of Jericho.\") His partner pulls him back to normal time when it is discovered he's suffering from time lag, evidenced by \"one of the first symptoms of time-lag is a tendency to maudlin sentimentality, like an Irishman in his cups or a Victorian poet cold-sober.\" His interview in the Infirmary always makes me laugh (\"Infirmary nurses usually resemble something out of the Spanish Inquisition, but this one had an almost kindly face, the sort an assistant torturer... might have.\")Ned is sent to 1888 with the dual purpose of recovering in the pastoral Victorian English countryside and returning an object to 1888 restore an incongruity and preserve the historical timeline. He meets an Oxford undergrad, Terence, and takes a idyllic boat ride down the Thames with him, only to discover Terence is intent on meeting a new infatuation, Lady Schrapnell's great(s)-grandmother, Tossie. While she has not attained the bossy demeanor of Lady S., she nonetheless has almost everyone falling in line with her ridiculous plans that include a seance and a jumble sale. What follows is a comedy of errors as the time-traveling historians attempt to keep the young would-be lovers separated. The historians are convinced Tossie needs to fall in love with an unknown man with the initial 'C' and begin combing the countryside for eligible (and not-so-eligible) bachelors. Accompanying them is a genuine Oxford don distracted by fish and history, a tenacious and fierce bulldog named Cyril, and a black cat. As cats are extinct in the modern era, poor Ned is particularly unskilled in managing them:\"I set her down, and she walked a few feet across the grass and then took off like a shot and disappeared round the corner of a wall. I told you so, Cyril said.\"Well, don't just stand there. Go after her,\" I said.Cyril continued sitting.He had a point. Our chasing after her in the woods hadn't been a roaring success. \"Well, what do you suggest then?\"He lay down, his muzzle against the milk bottle, and it wasn't a bad idea.\"A caveat: this is not hard or traditional science-fiction. The most science fiction-like aspect supposes that time travel is possible, but only in ways that don't effect the past or allow travelers to bring objects into the future. The field is known as temporal physics, and it while it is still being explored, incongruities--artificial changes to the timeline--could \"theoretically could alter the course of history, or if it were severe enough, destroy the universe.\" Luckily for us, the universe is self-repairing, and has lines of defense that might manifest as an increase in coincidental events. We learn this in brief scenes between the time travelers and it's artfully done.Characterization is wonderfully done. The historians are well-developed and multi-dimensional. I confess I especially love Cyril, who is completely dog-like but provides a silent foil for Ned's thoughts.While I recognize the style and pace won't appeal to everyone, especially the action-adventure reader, I'm ridiculously fond of this book. I've re-read it numerous times, especially when I want to be in a book holding pattern, reading something familiar and enjoyable that didn't keep me up until 2 a.m. reading. I've read it so many times that I find myself quoting it, even if no one else gets my references. In fact, I once slightly embarrassed myself by exclaiming, \"a genuine Oxford don!\" courtesy of the passage, \"I sat there watching him examine the fish and marvelling at what we'd caught. A genuine eccentric Oxford don. They're an extinct species, too.\" Well, he was a genuine eccentric don, after all--he studied voodoo and death practices.Anyone who reads my reviews knows I have a fondness for the well-turned phrase, but while I often smile reading this book, the humor is built up over repeating passages rather than the the standard quip. This is gentle, suspenseful, silly, romantic and sophisticated reading. Filled with literary references and philosophizing on the importance of individuals in history versus scientific principles, someone with a classic background might best appreciate the wide-ranging references, but despite my own infirm education, I didn't find them inaccessible. If you enjoy Bertie Wooster, Shakespeare, Agatha Christie and Lord Peter mysteries, history, gentle comedic romance and literary references, the sly wit in this book will keep you entertained.

This will be a long, very boring review that will not do this book justice. Quite a few digressions to be expected, too. There will be no silly fangirling involved either. My love for this book goes beyond that. If I had to choose 3 books to take with me to a desert island this would be one of them. I love it more with every reread. Why? Because it's the improbable mix of three of the things I love the most. And as improbable as the mix is, it works. Because Connie Willis is an amazing writer. No, strike that. Simply saying she's an amazing writer doesn't even begin to cover it. There are not enough words to express how much I love her and every book she ever wrote. I could reread each and every one of them over and over again and never get bored (except maybe from All Clear, which was the sad exception to my I'm-Desperately-In-Love-With-Anything-Connie-Willis-Ever-Wrote-Writes-And-Will-Write condition). To get to the point: Connie Willis = Sheer Brilliance \u2190 yes, I lied when I said there would be no fangirling to be had in this review. It might not be silly but it's there.At this point you might be wondering what that improbable mix of three of the things I love the most I mentioned above is. Then again, probably not. But hey, I started writing this review so I might as well get on with it. And I guess I should issue a warning at this point, because I'm going to talk about my grandmother. Yes, my grandmother. I never get personal in my reviews but this book wouldn't be one of my all-time favourites had it not been for my grandmother. So I want to tell you a few things about her. Because she's the one who introduced me to those Famous Three Things that make me love this book so much. My grandmother was French Canadian. She was born in 1910 and stayed in love with the 1930s and 1940s of her youth until her dying day. The movies, the stars, the fashion, she loved it all. When I was growing up she had me watch all the screwball comedies she could get her hands on. She had tons of 1930s & 1940s movies on VHS tapes (yes, I am aware that 90% of GR users probably don't even know what those are. But I don't care. And I actually feel pretty proud of being one of this site's dinosaurs) and I would watch them over and over again. And used to wish I'd not been born in the silly 1970s (I mean The Love Boat and disco vs. George Cukor and Cary Grant? Please someone take me back in time). And I wanted to be Katharine Hepburn in The Philadelphia Story when I grew up. So that's Famous Three Things #1: screwball comedies.Back to my grandmother. She was crazy about British Litterature. And when I say crazy I mean CRAZY. She loved the classics but the one thing she just couldn't resist? Humour and wit. The first book she ever made me read? Something Fresh by P.G. Wodehouse. I can't remember how old I was when I first read it but I do remember falling in love with Wodehouse. He's been one of my favourite authors ever since. My grandmother's 1933 copy of Something Fresh sits on my bedside table and whenever I feel down I just open it at random and read a few pages. It works better than all the alcohol in the world. Now there was one book that my grandmother suggested I read that I've always had mixed feelings about: Three Men in a Boat by Jerome K. Jerome. Why is this important? Because the subtitle for this much-loved classic is To Say Nothing of the Dog. Yes, this is where Connie Willis got the title for her book. Jerome's story plays a very important part in Willis' book, too. And Willis' book could be considered a homage to Jerome's. I can't recount how many times I've read Three Men in a Boat in a desperate attempt to love it as much as everyone else does. Sometimes I think it's boring as hell, sometimes I think \"hey, I think I get it now\" but most times I just find it meh. Now that I've just reread To Say Nothing of the Dog I feel like giving Jerome's book another try. Obviously. I wonder how it will go this time. I'm not keeping my hopes up. Anyway, this was Famous Three Things #2: humorous British Lit.As much as she loved the 1930s and British Lit, my grandmother was a science-fiction buff. Yeah, she was a pretty cool grandma. Her science fiction books? I haven't seen a more extensive collection to this day. And although she didn't actually introduce me to time travel novels, it's my grandmother's love for anything science-fiction that led me to discover that particular subgenre. I was never a fan of space operas and books involving aliens, distant galaxies, androids etc but time travel? I've always LOVED it (digression time: want to read one of the best time travel stories ever written? Read Time and Again. End of digression time). And that's Famous Three Things #3: time travel.So I'm halfway through this review and I haven't said a thing about the book yet. Sigh. I told you this would be long and boring. Let's do a little recap here. We have screwball comedies + humorous British Lit + time travel. And where does that take us? To Connie Willis of course. Because To Say Nothing of the Dog is the perfect mix of all these things. And more. So much more: it's P.G. Wodehouse meets the space time continuum meets comedic romp meets Agatha Christie meets the Victorian era meets Alternate History meets Dorothy L. Sayers meets fantasy of manners meets Everything I've Ever Loved. It's hilarious (well my kind of hilarious anyway), it's clever, it's witty, it's interesting, it's fun, it's thought-provoking and DAMN I still haven't said a word about the story. And I won't either. Just know that this book is about time travel and Victorian society. About chaos theory and bulldogs. About The Battle of Waterloo and hemorrhoids. About the butterfly effect and butlers who read Darwin. About crisis points and the drowning of extinct cats. About the Enigma machine and jumble sales. About penwipers and the least likely suspect. About Ultra and spiritualism. About time-lag and chaperones. About meddling with history and loose lips. About self-corrections and Coventry Cathedral. About space time continuum incongruities and Oxford dons. And ultimately it's about the Bishop's bird stump. But is it really? Maybe not. Everything is relative here. So you'll just have to read the book to find out. If you still feel like reading this book after being put through my review that is. I'm pretty sure the number of people who had this book on their to-read list just plummeted. So just forget you ever read this review and trust me when I say: this book. Read it.Sadly enough my grandmother passed away before To Say Nothing of the Dog was published. Had she had the chance to read it I'm pretty sure she would have LOVED it as much as I do."}, {"userName": "thefourthvine", "userReviewDate": "Jun 04, 2007", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/115625-thefourthvine", "userReview": "First, know that I am deeply biased when it comes to this book: it's got time travel, which I love with a love that is more than love, and it's got Cyril, who I love with a love that makes my time travel love look like a Tuesday afternoon romance. Plus, it's inspired by - and references, oh my god, REFERENCES! - one of my favorite books, Jerome K. Jerome's Three Men in a Boat. So, you know, I won't even attempt a qualitative review. I'll just say that this is fun, and funny, and it hits my narrative kinks so hard that I would marry it if there was a church that solemnized bibliopolygamy.

I was re-reading old favourites again and again, waiting for a few trusted authors to release new works. Something had to be done.On the spur of the moment I set myself a challenge, to read every book to have won the Locus Sci-Fi award. That\u2019s 35 books, 6 of which I\u2019d previously read, leaving 29 titles by 14 authors who were new to me.While working through this reading list I got married, went on my honeymoon, switched career and became a father. As such these stories became imprinted on my memory as the soundtrack to the happiest period in my life (so far).Have you read \nPassage\n, by Connie Willis? I have. It was the first Willis I read. We didn\u2019t get on.\nTo Say Nothing of the Dog\n arrived in the post shortly afterwards, and I wasn\u2019t exactly bouncing off the walls in excitement. I looked at the book. The book looked at me. I shoved in on a shelf and went back to reading \nCyteen\n. I read another half-dozen books before I worked up the courage to even consider it.I was packing books for my honeymoon. I wasn\u2019t sure how much reading I\u2019d get done because we were planning an action packed holiday (wink-wink-nudge-nudge!) so I lobbed in a couple of books I\u2019d been putting off \u2013 \u2018\nThe Dog\n, and \nYears of Rice & Salt\n. As it turned out, I nearly broke my ankle on our second day in Malta so we spent our time hobbling around the pool (and restaurants!) instead of all the mountain climbing and scuba-diving we had intended. Lots more time for reading than expected!My darling wife actually nabbed '\nThe Dog\n before I\u2019d looked at it. I was still grinding my way through the latter half of \nCryptonomicon\n when she started flicking through the first chapter.Isn\u2019t this by the same writer you called \u2018bloody miserable\u2019?Yeah.It\u2019s funny!Really?Yeah....Really?I\u2019m borrowing it.\u2018Kay.It turned out she really enjoyed it and recommended it highly. Which came as something of a surprise. My point (and I understand if you\u2019d given up all hope of me reaching it) is that stories take you on a journey \u2013 and how you connect with and take enjoyment from that journey can be hugely influenced by what you expect from the book and what\u2019s going on in your life at that time. Had I read \u2018\nThe Dog\n the moment it came through the letterbox (ignoring the fact that I would have been interrupting \nCyteen\n midway through which is most out of character for me) I don\u2019t think it would have had the same effect on the post-\nPassage\n, pre-Wedding, collapsing quantum wave-front that we call my sentient consciousness. But this was the right book at the right time, and I loved it!With humour, it\u2019s all subjective \u2013 it won\u2019t be everyone\u2019s cup of tea but I found it very funny. It\u2019s not exactly laugh-out-loud funny, but definitely dry-tickle-in-your-cheeks funny and stick-in-your-head funny. Particularly the effects of time lag in \u2018difficulty distinguishing sounds\u2019 \u2013 this has become a long running gag in our house ever since. Pretending to have difficulty distinguishing what your wife has said when she\u2019s asking you to do chores \u2013 it\u2019s hilarious\u2026 to me anyway.The cats. The dog. The goldfish. The chaos theory. The Alice-in-Wonderland conversations. The Bishop\u2019s bloody bird-stump! Oh yes, please! More?Never before has an author pulled a U-turn in my estimations with such panache; you wily bird, Willis! The Oxford Time-Travel series is an odd and scatter-shot series. This book made me smile, \nDoomsday\n tried hard to make me cry and Blackout / All Clear had me tearing out my hair with anxiety. Why couldn\u2019t she just write a direct sequel to this?Ned gets the girl\u2026\u201cAnd kissed her for a hundred and sixty-nine years.\u201d  \u2026 but what happened next, hmmm!?There should be a whole series of Victorian adventures with Ned and Verity. And kittens. A happy 5-stars. Definitely check it out.You might not click \u2013 I\u2019ll admit, it doesn\u2019t work for a decent percentage of readers \u2013 but\u2026but\u2026 you might just discover a new book for your favourites shelf.

But for me, comedy works best in TV shows or movies. Humour in print works best in shorter formats, like cartoon strips or magazine articles. I tend to find \u201ccomic novels\u201d (not to be confused with graphic novels) problematical. The trouble is I keep expecting to laugh at every page and that is a tall order for the authors. I don\u2019t expect to be thrilled by every page of a thriller or to be scared by every page of a horror novel so I don\u2019t know why I have such a high expectation of comic novels. Just a personal quirk I guess. Consequently, I tend to be less interested in comic novels because I find very few of them consistently funny through out the book.To Say Nothing of the Dog is a comic sci-fi novel, and it is a good one. It is not in the same league as Douglas Adamsor Robert Sheckley mind bendingly funny sf but it is a pleasant read and the humour works well enough from time to time. The style of humour is reminiscent of classic comic novels by P.G. Wodehouse and Oscar Wilde. Of course the title of the book is a tribute to Jerome K. Jerome\u2019s classic Three Men in a Boat, a book I kind of dislike (review). I found it to be tedious, tame and almost mirth-free. Probably not Jerome\u2019s fault it just did not work for me. Having read \u201cThree Men\u201d out of curiosity and as a sort of preparation for reading To Say Nothing of the Dog my subsequent dislike of it does not bode well for Connie Willis\u2019 book. On the other hand, I totally love her Doomsday Book, one of the finest sf books I read in the past few years. To Say Nothing of the Dog is part of Ms Willis' loosely connected Oxford Time Travel series which includes Doomsday Book but the tone is very different. While Doomsday Book is intense and tragic To Say Nothing of the Dog is almost entirely breezy. I persevered through the less than riveting first few chapters and eventually settled into enjoying the book.It would be a mistake to expect To Say Nothing of the Dog to be a sci-fi version of or tribute to Jerome\u2019s book. Ms. Willis is clearly influenced by more diverse material than just one book. Her love for the crime fiction of Agatha ChristieAnd Dorothy L. Sayers is also evident. Best of all she did not neglect the sci-fi aspect of it, the book went on to win the Hugo and Locus Awards in 1999, and also a Nebula Award nomination.What raises To Say Nothing of the Dog far above Three Men in a Boat is that there is more to it than just trying to elicit laughter. There are the intriguing logic and logistics of time travelling which Willis beautifully worked out. The characters are also generally amiable and as something of an anglophile myself I enjoy the British culture references like jumble sales, the \u201ctube trains\u201d and the Jeevesian acerbic butler dialogue.My only complaint is that for the most part there is very little sense of urgency to the proceeding (until the last two or three chapters). The lighthearted tone is maintained throughout the book and the story moves amiably at a leisurely pace. This led to my initial feeling that the novel is too tame, the stakes are too low. As it turns out all of time and space continuum is at stake and a sense of danger eventually appears toward the end as the main characters\u2019 strive to repair \u201cincongruities\u201d, which is Willis\u2019 term for time travelling paradoxes. I like that she is using a different term for these paradoxes from the standard time travelling stories it somehow makes the story seem more believable.To Say Nothing of the Dog is not a laugh-a-minute book, it is not a complete success as a comic novel, but neither is it a failure. More importantly, as a lighthearted time travelling sci-fi novel it is worth a read. Just don\u2019t go into it with the wrong expectations.(3.5 stars)"}, {"userName": "Algernon", "userReviewDate": "Sep 03, 2011", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/4728718-algernon", "userReview": "A most entertaining adventure where Oxford dons get to meddle with time travel and a chance for the author to exercise her wit and to pay homage to great British authors.

To Say Nothing of the Dog takes its name (and much of its sensibility) from the famous novella by Jerome K. Jerome, Three Men in a Boat, To Say Nothing of the Dog. This choice is not incidental, but neither is it overwhelmingly important to the novel as a whole. The story is told through the eyes of Ned Henry, a time travelling historian in the not-too-distant future, as we witness his adventures into the late Victorian past. Poor Ned is overworked and just looking for a bit of a rest. His employer, the demanding and overbearing (and appropriately named) Lady Shrapnell, is looking to collect the various \u201ctreasures\u201d that once resided in Coventry Cathedral in order to complete a restoration project, including a mysterious object known as \u201cthe bishop\u2019s bird stump.\u201d With no concern for the health of her staff or the laws of time, Shrapnell runs her team into the ground, and Ned into an advanced case of time-lag, the mind-muddling result of excessive time travel. Think jet lag but about 100 times worse and 1,000 times more entertaining. Prescribed two weeks of rest to recover but perpetually hounded by Lady Shrapnell, Ned is given the chance to travel back to the late Victorian countryside for a bit of R&R. However, Ned is no expert in the chosen time, so naturally hilarity ensues. Of course, time travel is never so simple as a quick jaunt into the past, so Ned must confront a tangle of time related difficulties while also trying to maneuver through the intricacies of straight-laced Victorian society. Time travel is a notoriously difficult narrative tool to handle properly. Even the most phenomenally plotted story can collapse under the weight of disbelief a slip in mechanics can create. The key is to focus on the most important \u201crules\u201d and to try to stick to them assiduously, while simultaneously avoiding the tendency to bog everything down in too much detail. Connie Willis has built a career and reputation on her ability to render time travel with just the right amount of detail and vagary to make her mechanics credible without overshadowing the plot with technical terms and excessive exposition. Granted, I\u2019m making this statement based on this particular book and hearsay, but I stand by it. Willis\u2019 time travel mechanics are simple, while their implications are much more complex. In Dog, the system is gradually revealed, rather than dumped on the reader first thing. This is beneficial in keeping things simple, but at the same time causes an occasional head scratching when an unexplained technical term is used. Everything is clarified in due time, however, so it\u2019s not really any hindrance to the story. The heart of the story isn\u2019t really the time travelling anyway. Most of the fun comes in the form of the characters Ned meets as he stumbles and blunders his way to a not-very-successful rest. A jaunt down the Thames soon introduces Ned to a myriad of famous Victorian types, including a poetry-spouting undergrad, an eccentric professor and a stiff-upper-lipped butler, to say nothing of the dog. Luckily for Ned, he also meets a fellow time traveler, the brilliant and beautiful Verity, who guides him through the social faux-pas minefield that was Victorian England. Verity is in 1888 on a mission, and when Ned becomes entangled as well, his rest goes right out the window and the trip becomes a mad dash to save all of time while still maintaining a stiff Victorian veneer.I really loved this book. It\u2019s so difficult not to go on and on about every little fascinating reference to Victorian culture and literature, and every brilliant twist in the time travel narrative, but the enjoyment is in the gradual reveal of detail, so I don\u2019t want to give anything away here. I will say that, while it\u2019s not really necessary, you may enjoy this book even more if you read  Three Men in a Boat first. Also, as much as I found to love in this book, I had some difficulty with Ned at first. As a narrator he\u2019s well up to the task, but as a character he could have used a bit more fleshing out. We never really know what he looks like, or much about him at all, other than the fact that he is a historian and not very well versed in Victorian history. Essentially, Ned plays the straight man, observing and reflecting the comedy going on around him, so once this is accepted the story rolls along quite nicely. Now, in the finest tradition of \u201cshow, don\u2019t tell,\u201d we do learn that Ned is very capable and intelligent by observing his reactions and puzzle solving abilities, rather than hear him go on about himself, and I think this is what finally won me over in his favor.If you like time travel, P.G.

From the clever phrases and deep PTSD exasperation to the total eventual collapse of the space-time continuum because of a freaking cat to THE BISHOP'S BIRD-STUMP, I find myself chortling nearly twenty years after the first read and again on the re-read.We're catapulted through time thanks to the Oxford History Department's time machine put to the disposal of a wealthy American patron who is, let's be frank, NUTS. She's sent seemingly countless overworked historians into the Blitz to recover artifacts from the destroyed cathedral at Covington. What really happens is a LOT of slippage in the time-stream, a deep mystery, even more miscommunication and strange coincidences and classic slapstick and some of the funniest Victorian Romance I've come across. Oh, it's definitely hardcore SF, but it's also a tribute to Jerome K Jerome's Three Men in a Boat and the spirit is very much alive and well.What we've got is a genre-masher of epic proportions. It's a high-stakes time-continuum travel and looming disaster, a truly atrocious MacGuffin that has everyone running around like headless chickens in a slapstick comedy, and a classic 1930's Hercule Peroit Agatha Christie mystery. All three genres are pulled off wonderfully! And she tops it all off with VERY well-turned phrases that stick with you so warmly. :) Charming? Beyond charming. Utterly delightful. No poppycock. :)"}, {"userName": "colleen the convivial curmudgeon", "userReviewDate": "May 05, 2009", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/1209800-colleen-the-convivial-curmudgeon", "userReview": "2 1/2I picked up this book because it was the read of the month for the Sci-fi/Fantasy group here on goodreads. Time travel tends to hurt my head, and this was no exception, but that's not what dragged it down.Honestly, I can't quite put my finger on why I didn't like it - but I'll try.To start with, I felt like it took a long while for the book to actually start. I guess there was too much set-up, or it was belabored too much. I didn't feel like it really got going until well into 200+ pages.Another thing was that I just didn't get how this book was \"hilarious\". It was mildly amusing, what with the comedy of errors and the little snark on Victorian mannerisms, but it was also belabored to the point of being repetitive and overdone.I kept reading because I wanted to finish it, not really because I was compelled to keep reading. I was curious as to how it would all work out - of course I was never in any doubt that it would all work out somehow.I give it an extra half star because I like how the end sort of wrapped up everything nicely, while at the same time leaving a little dangling question, and I like how the romance between Verity and Ned was handled in juxtaposition to the saccharine Tossie and St. Trewes thing. Oh, and I did like the part with Baine, and Tossie, and the river... So 2 stars overall... 2 1/2 for a satisfying conclusion..."}, {"userName": "Trish", "userReviewDate": "May 06, 2018", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/3461034-trish", "userReview": "This is the second story about the Oxford Time Travel Institute. It is only loosely connected to the first, namely through Mr. Dunworthy, whom we know from book 1. And wasn't I glad about that (the first book and I didn't get along too splendidly).It is 2057 (thus, a few years after the first book) and here, Mrs. Schrapnell, a rich and very eccentric (if not to say gaga) American lady is pouring money into rebuilding Coventry Cathedral exactly as it was before the Nazi Blitz during WWII. She has therefore conscripted the Oxford history department to help her and, in addition, to find the Bishop's Bird Stump, a decorational piece from Coventry Cathedral. The problem is that she\u2019s working everyone to death, sending the historians up and down the timeline to find the blasted thing because it was lost (not destroyed, that much they know). But even if they find it (despite not even knowing what it looks like), they cannot just bring it to the future with them because the natural laws of the time continuum prevent anything of significance from being brought from the past to the future (or getting too close to historical events of significance so no historian can mess about). Any attempt at circumventing this law results in the time traveller either being sent to the right time but a completely different place (could be just a couple of kilometers or even another continent), or to the right place but the wrong time so the traveller can't create a paradox. In extreme cases, the continuum can even correct paradoxes by changing the course of events in minor ways to keep the original outcome the same. Yes, that means that the time continuum itself is kind of like a character here.Due to the fact that the historians are working around the clock, suffering from time lag (yes, like jet lag, only worse), mistakes are made and slowly but surely we notice that the timeline (the net) is fighting back.Ned, one of the historians, is suffering so much from time lag that he is sent to Victorian England for recovery (out of the way of Mrs. Schrapnell) just as a colleague of his has accidentally brought a cat forwards in time, supposedly violating the afore-mentioned time continuum law, which could even lead to the Nazis finding out about the Enigma having been compromised - which could, in turn, lead to a different outcome of WWII! But history has a way of sorting itself out so of course he is smack in the middle of the continuum problem as well as contemporary romantic entanglements. To say nothing of the dog. ;)Connie Willis obviously loves Jerome K. Jerome's book Three Men in a Boat and has therefore incorporated the style as well as many plot elements of that book. She combines them with the style of other works, such as Agatha Christie\u2019s and Arthur Conan Doyle\u2019s crime novels or Shakespeare\u2019s romantic comedies. However, she cleverly intertwines all of that with the time travel element and impresses once again with the amount of details, in this case mostly about the Victorian era. This combination makes this book much lighter and funnier than the first. Sure, the future of humanity is at stake, but we\u2019re laughing along with the cat, are exasperated at the sheer stupidity of Tossie, and just enjoy the romp through all the misunderstandings in general. To say nothing of the time riddle and what really has happened. A very clever plot, I have to admit. In retrospect, the signs were indeed there, if one had only known where to look.Thus, while I was once again annoyed (especially about the fact that nobody just shut Mrs. Schrapnell into a closet, her money be damned) and although I would have wished for a bit more history (Victorian England is not as interesting to me as - for example - Ancient Rome), I enjoyed this much more than the first volume. Probably because I could actually laugh along with some of the people and liked both Princess Arjumand and Cyril (the cat and the dog) very much so I was thoroughly delighted that they played such central roles."}, {"userName": "Hannah Grace", "userReviewDate": "Jan 20, 2008", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/798575-hannah-grace", "userReview": "This is my absolute favorite book. A perfect blend of sci-fi, historical fiction, mystery, comedy, mistaken identity and romance; this book has it all. Its the not-too-distant future, but time-travel has been around for awhile. Oxford historian Ned Henry is trying desperately to find a hideous Victorian object, the Bishop's Bird Stump, shuttling back and forth between World War Two and the Victorian Era. Meanwhile, another historian, Verity Kindle, accidentally brings something back from the past, potentially changing history and destroying time-travel. Ned (who only knows about the Victorian Era from Jerome K. Jerome's book, Three Men in a Boat to Say Nothing of the Dog) and Verity have to live in a ridiculous-and completely realistic-Victorian house, trying to help history correct itself but generally making things worse. Its clever, without the smug voice that tends to accompany clever novels. Towards the middle it gets a little slow, but if you keep going it picks right back up with a great finish.

I had gone to add a book to my to-read shelf and there sat To Say Nothing of the Dog by Connie Willis as big as life. Now that can't be right, I thought. I read this in 2010. I loved this book. I'm sure I even reviewed it. I thought. Therefore, there are no read dates I can assign to this, other than it was early 2010, either January, or February. Well, well. Almost two years. How time flies. Call it a facet of the aging process. That's a phrase my wife taught me after a fall she had. I did tell her not to wear those shoes, clunky platform sandals, that she would catch the sole on something or other and that she would hit the dirt. And she did, going to get her new car tag, which an officer had been so kind to remind her was, oh, expired by about a year.I'm sitting in my doctor's office when I get a call on my cell from a strange man asking are you married to...yep, my wife. \"Uh-huh.\" There's a bit of silence on the other end of the phone, then he blurts, \"Well, she's fallen in front of the courthouse annex and she looks pretty bad.\" \"Uhm, Doc, how bout you check out your next patient, MJ fell and I gotta go get her. We'll be back. You'll get a twofer today.\"So, up to the annex where I know everybody from being a courthouse regular. A lady looks up, \"Oh. She's in the back.\" I skip around the corner. There's my wife wearing those clunky platform sandals with a bag of ice over her face. I gingerly pulled it away and winced.\"Dey were bery dice. I got by dag.\" She said, pointing to the tag in her lap.\"Uh-huh. Come on, we're going back to the Doc's. Thanks everybody for taking care of her.\" She had caught the sole of her shoe on the curb and slammed face first onto the sidewalk. In a way, it was where the sidewalk ended--for her that day. Oh, that was bad. She told me so on the way to the Doc's.Back at the Doc's ranch, things were jumping. The waiting room was full. I signed in again and signed in my wife as well. About this time she's tapping me on the shoulder and announces: \"And ib ooo eber boo anyding lige dad agin, I'b galling de bolice.\"You could have heard a pin drop. Then she gives this goofy grin and says \"I was only kidding.\" The receptionist rescued me and said she really was, that I had told her as I blew by her on the way out that I was going to pick my wife up who had fallen. AND...He's the director of the domestic violence shelter.There was a mass sigh of relief. I could hear my pulse diminishing in my ears.Only, after the Doc patched her up, MJ would be in mid-sentence and wouldn't be able to come up with a word, like, dog for instance. So the Doc does a referral to a neurologist who ultimately says she has a visceral loop, it's ok, and everything should be fine, to say nothing about not being able to say dog.I overheard MJ calling her brother when we got home. She was explaining her diagnosis, saying, \"I have a...vaginal loop.\" I can hear her brother's loud \"WHAT?\" from across the room, got on the other extension and explained things.Everything was fine. My wife got all her words back, particularly when issuing opinions, suggestions, instructions, imprimaturs, and so on.So, I must have had some kind of visceral loop (Is that a real diagnosis? I'm thinking she substituted visceral for something else that started with a vee. I know it wasn't virginity. Wait, wait--it was venous!) when I forgot to shelve and review this great book.And you were wondering when we would get to this point. We're here. Think of it as traveling with children. After all the \"When are we gonna get theres,\" you arrive at your destination.Connie Willisis one of my favorite speculative fiction writers. I say speculative as opposed to science fiction, not as a disparagement to science fiction, but because there's not a lot of science in this book. It is your basic time travel story, complete with the classic time travel paradox, i.e. don't change anything, you'll screw everything back in the present to heck and gone.Willis won the Hugo and Locus Awards for Best Science Fiction (I don't believe they have awards for speculative fiction, do they?) in 1998. She was nominated for the 1999 Nebula Award, but Joe Haldemanwon for Forever Peace. Well, you can't win 'em all. However, she has won eleven Hugos, Seven Nebulas, four Locus Awards, and the John W. Campbell Award for Lincoln's Dreams back in 1988. In short, she's damned good.Willis' best recognized works are set in Oxford in the 21st Century. Historians are constantly sent back in time to make sure things are going along swimmingly and to conduct historical research to see what really happened. After all, as we all know, history is written by the victors. Most of the \"drops\" back in time occur during World War II, focusing on the time of the Blitz, as something happened to really wreck the time continuum back then. Her other blockbuster, Doomsday Bookfocused on a drop to the 14th century. Can you say \"Bubonic Plague?\" I know you can!One of the features of Willis' time travel novels that especially appeals to me are her takes on the foibles of humanity. During the most dire of circumstances you will find some character or characters focusing on the most inconsequential matter while the world is falling apart around their ears. An example would be the Bell Ringers who are bent and determined on performing a bell performance at Christmas, although the plague has been brought to 2057 quite by accident.A word about the title: Willis dedicated To Say Nothing of the Dog to Robert HEINLEIN for introducing her to Three Men in a Boat: To Say Nothing of the Dog by Jerome K. Jerome, published in 1889. It is a comic tale of a boating holiday on the Thames. The boating trip occurred. However, the dog, Montmorency, was completely fictional.\"To Say Nothing of the Dog\" is the perfect title. Willis deals with two drops back into time. One, to 1889, to return something which a historian erroneously brought back from that time and the other being to a Cathedral that existed in Coventry which was bombed to smithereens by the Luftwaffe. Returning the item to 1889 is a real problem, because the only historian available to take the item back is poor Ned Henry, a specialist in 20th century history. He knows NOTHING about the 1880's. Further, he's made so many drops of late, he's developed time lag. By the time he gets to 1889, he's forgotten his destination and what he was to return. Well, here's a pretty howdy-do. Of course, who should he run into but Jerome K. Jerome and his boating pals. Comedy ensues.In the meanwhile, Lady Schrapnell, who is wealthier than any human deserves, has determined that she WILL have Coventry Cathedral restored just as it existed before it was bombed during WWII. Almost every historian has been assigned to the task of dropping back to make sure that things are done correctly. There's one slight problem. There was the \"Bishop's Bird Stump,\" which seems to have gone missing. The problem is no one knows what the heck it looked like.Historian Verity Kindle who specializes in 1930's mystery fiction is sent back to read one Tossie Mering's diary, Tossie, an ancestor of Lady Schrapnell spoke of an event which caused her to elope with \"Mr. C. who believes it may contain a clue as to what happened to the bird stump and what it looked like.Verity complicated things by unwittingly bringing Tossie's Cat back to 2057 where cats have become extinct. Prince Armujand, yes, that's his name, cute as he is, has to go back. That's a darned shame because everybody in 2057 at the time continuum project wants one.Will Ned remember what he's returning and where it belongs? Will Tossie be united with Prince? Will Tossie elope to America with the stranger, Mr. C? And just what the heck was that Bishop's Bird Stump?Think of Wilde's \"The Importance of Being Earnest.\" Mix well with \"It's a Mad, Mad, Mad, Mad World, toss with H.G. Well's \"The Time Machine,\" and serve immediately.I won't tell you about the Bishop's Bird Stump, but it couldn't have been uglier than those clunky shoes of my wife. Of course, Victorian bric a brac could be so darned gauche.Time travel? Check. Adventure? Check. Romance? Check, check. Comedy of errors? Check, check, check. Comedy of Manners? Are you kidding me? People NEVER change! Time Travel? Oh, yeah. Puppies and Kitties? Got them, too.Rating: 4.5"}, {"userName": "Althea Ann", "userReviewDate": "Jun 09, 2010", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/3846743-althea-ann", "userReview": "This book was a real stand-out for me! I picked it up after reading some good reviews, and I was pleasantly surprised to like it even better than I expected.It's a time-travel/mystery/romance which is consistently witty and often downright hilarious. Books which are simultaneously literary and humorous are hard to come by - but here, Willis succeeds amazingly well.In the near future, time travel has been discovered. It's being used by a wealthy society dame, Lady Schrapnell, in her well-funded pet project - to restore Coventry Cathedral, destryed in a WWII bombing raid. Her time-travelling agents live in fear of her harridan-like ways, especially Ned Henry, who's been assigned to ascertain exactly what happened to the Bishop's Bird Stump (a particularly grotesque and rococo piece of Victorian art).Indirectly, this assignment takes him to Victorian England, where, affected by severe time-lag (think jet-lag x10) he ends up travelling down the river in the company of a recently-lovestruck young man - and a boisterous dog. The action picks up from there, with a cast of quirky characters, including the ditzy blonde Tossie, the pre-raphaelite beauty Verity, eccentric professors, prudish-and-proper parents, fraudulent psychics, and, of course, Princess Arjumand.I haven't read \"Three Men in a Boat, to Say Nothing of the Dog!\" by Jerome K. Jerome - a genuine Victorian comedy that apparently inspired Willis stylistically - but I can say that this book would definitely appeal to any fans of Victorian fiction (experts in the field would, I'm sure, 'get' many things that I missed), as well as classic mystery fans (Arthur Conan Doyle and Agatha Christie are referenced more than once), and, of course, sci-fi/time travel aficionados.

In this way is was a bit like Stephen King's 11/22/63, with coincidences and alteration of time jumps preserving the general thrust of history. Of course that doesn't stop us from studying the past, but there isn't much money in that especially when time travelers can't even get close to the good stuff since the continuum won't risk many changes. This, as you can imagine, leaves funds for time travel a bit difficult to get. Of course this just makes universities and time travel organizations desperate enough to offer their talents to the super wealthy, in this case a rich American who is obsessed the Coventry Cathedral which had a major impact on the life of an ancestor of hers. She decides to spend lavishly to create a perfect reconstruction of it, down to every insignificant detail and harangues the time travel agencies to send their workers on time travel drops of every conceivable kind to get every little detail perfect.The book opens with the main character and time travel historian Ned Henry in a bad spot, stuck on a seemingly impossible mission to determine what has happened to the Bishop's Bird Stump, a historic artifact that has yet to be located fro the reconsecration of the Coventry Cathedral. He is also suffering heavily from time-lag, a by product of too frequent time travel which affects the mind in a similar manner as extreme fatigue. He then finds himself on a bit of a misadventure as he is sent back to the Victorian era for an easy mission (which he does not remember) to meet another agent (whom he does not recall) and then spend the rest of the time relaxing.Sufficed to say nothing goes as planned. He is still completely time lagged and has no idea what he is doing. He falls with a bunch of very colorful characters right out of a Victorian story: the matron obsessed with the spirits, a patron who loves his fish and finds spiritualism to be a bunch of hooey, the absent minded Oxford Don, the hyper efficient but constantly put upon butler, the romantic and poetry spouting undergrad who falls in love with the spoiled and pampered daughter of the aforementioned patron and matron, to say nothing of the dog. Ned and his fellow agent Verity (who he does meet up with) try to unravel all the many accidents and problems they inadvertently cause in the time line while navigating this tangled social web. This was for the most part a really fun read. The characters were suitable absurd that I would often find myself laughing out loud at their antics. Willis does an excellent job balancing the time travel plot and the quest for the Bishop's Bird Stump with the Victorian era events that Ned and Verity end up mucking up a bit. By the end we discover the mystery behind all the tricks the continuum has been playing on the time travelers and just what happened to that wretched bird stump (a solution found using nothing but Ned's \"little gray cells\" as Poirot would say). I found the conclusion of the book quite satisfying with everything wrapped up nicely and logically.While I did enjoy the book a lot I thought the beginning and ending dragged a bit. The beginning was a bit slow and then Ned gets hit with full blown time-lag so what was going on around him wasn't terribly clear. Things didn't really get going until he ends up on the Thames in the 19th century. The ending felt a bit rushed and cluttered but it did get the important points acrossAll in all well worth reading as the absurd characters, great writing, and time travel mystery really kept me engaged. Also, while this is the second book in the Oxford Time Travel Series, it is a stand alone book that doesn't require knowledge of the first to enjoy."}, {"userName": "Sarah", "userReviewDate": "Sep 24, 2016", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/23841736-sarah", "userReview": "Most of this book was four stars for me but then it went and got clever.

He's taken nearly 15 trips back to the 1940s to find the Bishop's Bird Stump and he's having no luck. Desperate to avoid Lady Schrapnell he goes to Mr. Dunworthy who promptly sends him back to the Victorian Era to have a bit of rest.

What many people don't necessarily know is that I first read it because I bought a very old copy of it at a book sale, and the reason I bought it was because I had read Have Space Suit-Will Travel by Robert A. Heinlein, (to whom To Say Nothing of the Dogis dedicated) in which the main character, Kip, interrupts his father as he is reading HIS favorite book, Three Men in a Boat, in which, he claims, all of life's lessons can be found.I think To Say Nothing of the Dog would be fine to read if you'd never read any of Jerome K. Jerome's writing, but I think a familiarity with his work makes this book even more fun to read. The little summaries of action at the start of each chapter, the many references to Jerome's book (and even his person!) during the first part of the book, and even to some degree the measured, deliberate pacing of the book all stand as tribute to Three Men in a Boat: To Say Nothing of the Dog.Of course this book does have it's own wacky men, it's own wacky (if short-lived) boat trip and it's own dog with a unique personality (albeit calmer than that of Montmorency!). I also appreciated that there is a cat who is quite a pivotal character - I take this to be another wink at the Heinlein fans reading - that man had such a thing for cats in his writing.As for the story itself, there is a great deal of time travel, which can be a head-scratcher, and there are some unique rules for it in this book, but overall, I thought it was highly interesting and enjoyable.

Time jumping carries certain risks: the more you jump, the more confused you become and at the start of the narrative Ned is thoroughly befuddled. Unfortunately, Lady Schrapnell doesn't believe in time sickness and keeps sending him on jumps.It soon becomes apparent that one of the historians created a paradox and now Ned is sent back to Victorian times, both to fix the paradox and to hide from Lady Schrapnell while he recuperates. He ends up going boating on the river with a nice Victorian chap and wacky misadventures begin. The book is excellent, witty, smart, charming. An homage to Jerome K. Jerome's THREE MEN IN A BOAT, it has all of the hilarity and befuddled silliness of the original. I definitely recommend it to anyone who enjoys time travel, Victorian time period, and humor. There is a light romance, eccentric professors, and a cute kitten. There is also some heavy duty physics and explorations of chaos theory, which are very cleverly camouflaged. It is written beautifully.Things I didn't quite like:Worldbuilding-wise things didn't always make sense. Cats are extinct in the future due to a feline pandemic, except that cats are routinely vaccinated against distemper and given how much we love them, I find it difficult to believe that all of the cats died before we found a cure. The future itself seems a bit thin: references are made to new things, but I never quite got a sense of the time period Ned is actually from, which is mid twenty-first century. It doesn't seem to be that advanced or that far removed in time and has very little flavor to it.Sometimes comedy and wit took front seat to character development, which resulted in a novel being populated by familiar, funny character types rather than individual characters. Lady Schrapnell is an archtype of a rich woman who can't take no for an answer, while the entire future history department is a collection of adorably absent-minded professors and long suffering grad students, who are letting her do whatever she wants and are afraid of her. There is an empty headed cute English miss, a besotted but goodhearted Victorian fellow, and equally familiar, intelligent and willful female historian. Yes, it is a farce - it's meant to be - but occasionally I felt like the actors in this comedy of manners had melted completely into their roles and the individual personalities were a little bit lost. To reiterate, an excellent read."}, {"userName": "Ian", "userReviewDate": "Feb 27, 2010", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/2465351-ian", "userReview": "Reviewing an uncategorizable book--an overbearing billionaress--rebuilding a cathedral--God is in the Details--too much time travel makes one loopy--drowning cats but not this one--fixing the incongruity--hilarity ensues with three men in a boat, to say nothing of the dog--quoting Victorian poetry--hot Victorian chicks and their mothers, to say nohing of their butlers--jumble sales and croquet and Waterloo--a setback--a mistery--a love story, to say nothing of the cat--more poetry--signing the Magna Carta--goldfish and historical references--more poetry and more historical references--another setback--another mistory--another love story--another incongruity--Victorian etiquette and taboos, to say nothing of the poetry--characters with a lot of personality, to say nothing of the dog--the perfect butler arrives from the future--panic in the Blitz--saving an atrocity from destruction--having faith in the Grand Design--the least likely suspect--the billionaress made happy--kittens and more poetry--happily ever after--four stars."}, {"userName": "Rebecca Foster", "userReviewDate": "Jan 09, 2017", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/5875398-rebecca-foster", "userReview": "(4.5) Time travel would normally be a turnoff for me, but Willis manages it perfectly in this uproarious blend of science fiction and pitch-perfect Victorian pastiche (boating, s\u00e9ances and sentimentality, oh my!).

The \"now\" setting is 2057, with the rebuilding of the Coventry Cathedral. Oh the steps that are taken in the interest of being artistically correct! Our intrepid time travelers are sent back into history to find/correct/undo or whatever needs be done to prevent or help correct the possibility of dreaded incongruities, all while searching for the Bishop's Bird Stump of the book's subtitle. There are so many incidents that evoke laughs or chuckles throughout the book but I really don't want to spoil the fun. There are mismatched lovers, seances, dark and stormy nights, boat rides on the Thames, jumble sales, cats and dogs important to the plot.Highly recommended for lovers of fun Scifi/fantasy.

But this time the result is a joyous journey into a past and future of comic mishaps and historical cross-purposes, in which the power of human love can still make all the difference. On the surface, England in the summer of 1888 is possibly the most restful time in history--lazy afternoons boating on the Thames, tea parties, croquet on the lawn--and time traveler Ned Henry is badly in need of a rest. He's been shuttling back and forth between the 21st century and the 1940s looking for a Victorian atrocity called the bishop's birdstump. It's only the latest in a long string of assignments from Lady Schrapnell, the rich dowager who has invaded Oxford University. She's promised to endow the university's time-travel research project in return for their help in rebuilding the famed Coventry Cathedral, destroyed in a Nazi air raid over a hundred years before. But the bargain has turned into a nightmare. Lady Schrapnell's motto is \"God is in the details,\" and as the l25th anniversary of the cathedral's destruction--and the deadline for its proposed completion--approaches, time-travel research has fallen by the wayside. Now Ned and his colleagues are frantically engaged in installing organ pipes, researching misericords, and generally risking life and limb. So when Ned gets the chance to escape to the Victorian era, he jumps at it. Unfortunately, he isn't really being sent there to recover from his time-lag symptoms, but to correct an incongruity a fellow historian, Verity Kindle, hasinadvertently created by bringing something forward from the past. In theory, such an act is impossible. But now it has happened, and it's up to Ned and Verity to correct the incongruity before it alters history or, worse, destroys the space-time continuum. And they have to do it while coping with eccentric Oxford dons, table-rapping spiritualists, a very spoiled young lady, and an even more spoiled cat. As Ned and Verity try frantically to hold things together and find out why the incongruity happened, the breach widens, time travel goes amok, and everything starts to fall apart--until the fate of the entire space-time continuum hangs on a sUance, a butler, a bulldog, the battle of Waterloo, and, above all, on the bishop's birdstump. At once a mystery novel, a time-travel adventure, and a Shakespearean comedy, \"To Say Nothing of the Dog\" is a witty and imaginative tale of misconceptions, misunderstandings, and a chaotic world in which the shortest distance between two points is never a straight line, and the secret to the universe truly lies \"in the details.\"", "title": "To Say Nothing of the Dog: or, How We Found the Bishop's Bird Stump at Last\n      \n          (Oxford Time Travel #2)", "url": "http://www.goodreads.com/book/show/824657.To_Say_Nothing_of_the_Dog", "average": 4.14, "cover": "https://images.gr-assets.com/books/1389498290l/824657.jpg", "reviews": 3218, "authors": [{"url": "https://www.goodreads.com/author/show/14032.Connie_Willis", "name": "Connie Willis"}], "type": ["Science Fiction", "Science Fiction", "Fiction", "Historical", "Fantasy"], "outlinks": ["http://www.goodreads.com/book/show/824657.To_Say_Nothing_of_the_Dog", "http://www.goodreads.com/book/show/77773.To_Say_Nothing_of_the_Dog", "http://www.goodreads.com/book/show/8194647-to-say-nothing-of-the-dog", "http://www.goodreads.com/book/show/116308.To_Say_Nothing_of_the_Dog", "http://www.goodreads.com/book/show/30257534-to-say-nothing-of-the-dog", "http://www.goodreads.com/book/show/24983.Doomsday_Book", "http://www.goodreads.com/book/show/6506307-blackout", "http://www.goodreads.com/book/show/7519231-all-clear", "http://www.goodreads.com/book/show/24985.Bellwether", "http://www.goodreads.com/book/show/24984.Passage", "http://www.goodreads.com/book/show/19755140-embassytown", "http://www.goodreads.com/book/show/32858845-off-to-be-the-wizard", "http://www.goodreads.com/book/show/33616599-beneath-the-shine", "http://www.goodreads.com/book/show/10931746-the-stepford-wives", "http://www.goodreads.com/book/show/22583196-time-s-divide", "http://www.goodreads.com/book/show/13604418-the-long-earth", "http://www.goodreads.com/book/show/20526820-gilded", "http://www.goodreads.com/book/show/26580636-infinity-lost", "http://www.goodreads.com/book/show/34111309-the-man-of-legends", "http://www.goodreads.com/book/show/31139576-all-the-breaking-waves", "http://www.goodreads.com/book/show/40193375-fellside", "http://www.goodreads.com/book/show/18108877-timebound", "http://www.goodreads.com/book/show/25071002-the-banished-of-muirwood", "http://www.goodreads.com/book/show/40204943-muirwood", "http://www.goodreads.com/book/show/18806963-prayers-to-broken-stones", "http://www.goodreads.com/book/show/18126623-2061", "http://www.goodreads.com/book/show/29425329-alas-babylon", "http://www.goodreads.com/book/show/40193696-3001", "http://www.goodreads.com/book/show/40205002-fractured", "http://www.goodreads.com/book/show/29103028-the-queen-s-poisoner", "http://www.goodreads.com/book/show/40269681-zeroes", "http://www.goodreads.com/book/show/18162904-dreams-and-shadows", "http://www.goodreads.com/book/show/36316055-touch-of-eternity", "http://www.goodreads.com/book/show/35106805-touch", "http://www.goodreads.com/book/show/40192858-dragon-rider", "http://www.goodreads.com/book/show/25353286-provenance", "http://www.goodreads.com/book/show/23249416-an-unwelcome-quest"]}
