I loved the level of complexity this book holds and was awed at how the author intertwined each detail fittingly. There are new characters that are so unique compared to the first book.The dreams that inhabit this book are dark. We understand how Ember restored *spoilers* soul after she had to kill *spoiler* in order to save a friend. The pacing was slower compared to the first book but I loved how detailed it was.There is romance but it\u2019s not overwhelming and it does not drive the plot. I enjoy this aspect greatly. I really liked to see how each relationship blooms into something more from Ember and Mace to Rhys and Kai and Tristin and Quinn. I loved how the supernatural elements in book 1 are added onto in book 2. We learn that Kai, Ember and Tristin are apart of the supernatural trinity and book 2 explores what this truly means. Overall I really enjoyed reading Dark Dreams and Dead Things. It is a unique aspect of the supernatural world."}, {"userName": "Hollie", "userReviewDate": "Aug 08, 2016", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/11216149-hollie", "userReview": "This series does have potential but the abundance of characters was just a bit much at times. It really seemed to take away from the personalities of the main characters. They felt bland and generic. Also, this one (similar to first book in series( had no real closure upon ending, so I can officially say I'm done with this series. If the series were complete Id possibly continue, but I was intrigued enough to eagerly await for the release of book 3. Likely by the time book 3 is released, I will have forgotten most of the details from book 1 and 2. It just wasn\u2019t overly memorable for me. I still think fans of YA books (basically all the characters in this book are 17 year old kids) and the fantasy/paranormal genre will like this series much better then myself. I think this one was just more up my 14 year old daughters alley versus my own."}, {"userName": "Lottie Lay", "userReviewDate": "Jul 01, 2016", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/40978474-lottie-lay", "userReview": "Some of you may have noticed I like books. *coughs* This is a review; I received and ARC of Dark Dreams and Dead Things by Martina McAtee and this is what I thought.-DISCLAIMER- I don't think there's any spoilers in here, but if you're especially sensitive to these things, then don't read on. Short version: I loved it.Read more...\"Fate is for fairy tales and sappy romance novels. The world is what we've made it. Do you accept my proposal or not?\"Dark Dreams and Dead Things is the sequel to Children Shouldn't Play with Dead Things. The series is a Young Adult Paranormal one by the lovely Martina McAtee. DDADT is very much a second book (I.E., read the first one first). It's teeing up for wonderful things, I can just feel it!I'm personally in love with the character development that happens over the course of this book. Oh boy, if there's one thing Martina does especially well it's characters. Some of the characters I found it difficult to sympathise with in book one are given rich new dimensions.The final few chapters are where the wonderful things really happen. I don't feel I can say much here without giving anything away, but I read the 2nd half of the book in one sitting, for a little context.One thing I didn't mention in my review of book one, is the LGBTQ themes of the series. I love this in ways I can't even express. Okay, so it's a \"straightforward\" male-male gay relationship, but we don't see enough of this in YA fiction. I'd love to see more complex LGBTQ themes addressed in YA, but hey, it's fantastic that is addressed here.There were a few minor editing issues, but these didn't detract from my enjoyment of the book. I definitely reccomend anyone who likes Paranormal YA to check this series out."}, {"userName": "Cranky - The Book Curmudgeon", "userReviewDate": "Aug 03, 2016", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/39383783-cranky---the-book-curmudgeon", "userReview": "***** 5 Cranky Stars *****Book two of The Dead Things Series was as intriguing as book one. At the end of the first book, I was left longing for the second, but simultaneously wondering how the author was going to match the momentum of book one. Well, she managed admirably.The author has included a very handy Character Guide at the start of the book to re-acquaint the reader with the rich cast of characters in the story. We meet all the old characters plus some new ones, both allies and protagonists.As in book one it is a reading feast of supernatural beings with a chuckle out loud sense of humour threading through the story, ending not on a cliffhanger but rather on a promise for more to come.Besides all the witchy, werewoolfy, ghostly goings on, the book deals with the love interests of the three main characters, focusing this time mainly on Kai and Rhys' relationship. I am not normally a fan of m/m romance, but this is so tastefully done that it is impossible to be or pretend to be offended."}, {"userName": "Whitney", "userReviewDate": "Oct 10, 2017", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/3852854-whitney", "userReview": "Definitely less exciting than the first book in the series.

The title of this book is no lie. In this second book in the series, we get to see what\u2019s become of Mace after Ember was forced to kill him to save Quinn. We saw at the end of the first book that Ember had actually restored Mace\u2019s soul, so this book tells us what happens to said soul. It isn\u2019t pretty. In the midst of seeing Mace\u2019s current predicament, we also learn the full details of what happened in Mace\u2019s distant past that led him to his choice to become a sluagh. Mace\u2019s chapters are pretty horrific \u2013 the things that he faced were painful and stomach churning \u2013 if you didn\u2019t have any love or sympathy for Mace in the first book, I\u2019m guessing Dark Dreams will change that. As terrible as they were, Mace\u2019s chapters were my absolute favorite part of this book and kept me turning the pages to see how all he endured led him to make the choices he did.Romantic developments. In the first book, there were a few different romances brewing \u2013 chemistry was abound between Kai and Rhys, Quinn and Tristin, and Ember and Mace. For the purposes of not spoiling things from the first book, I won\u2019t say which of the romances truly get off the ground and which are thrown into chaos, but I will say that it\u2019s a combination of the two. In this second book, we get to see how those relationships are shaped by the climactic events of the first book \u2013 each of the couples is affected in some pretty major ways, and all three couples struggle to overcome some pretty hefty obstacles. Even though I wasn\u2019t always the biggest fan of Ember and Mace in the first book, I found myself rooting for all three couples in this second book!Pack mentality. Just like in the first book, the secondary characters in this book are not secondary \u2013 in fact, I\u2019m not even completely sure who qualifies as a secondary character, since the books are told in so many different POV\u2019s (which I didn\u2019t mind at all \u2013 I liked getting all of the different perspectives!). Themes of love, friendship and loyalty are huge in these books. Ember is embraced as a member of the pack \u2013 and that bond goes deep!What Left Me Wanting More:Slightly slow read (but not slow pacing). Both of the books in this series took me longer to read than is typical for me. For one thing, they\u2019re relatively long at over 500 pages each. But they\u2019re also pretty complex \u2013 these are not the types of books you breeze through. There\u2019s a lot of paranormal history to ingest and a ton of magical and storyline details that are really important and can\u2019t just be glossed over. But I wouldn\u2019t say that the books have slow pacing, and I really enjoyed them \u2013 but since I\u2019m a quick reader, I tend to feel a tiny bit of frustration when I feel like I\u2019m moving through a book slowly. This is obviously a personal preference type of thing, and many people will probably love every moment of the intense worldbuilding.Some grammar errors. The first book in the series had a decent number of minor grammar errors \u2013 mostly homonym substitutions (too instead of to, etc.) and apostrophe errors. The second book had less, but I still definitely noticed some \u2013 BUT it\u2019s possible that the grammar errors might be fixed in the final copy of the second book. (I\u2019m fairly certain the copy of the first book I got was not an ARC, however, so those errors are probably there to stay). I will say, though, that the overall quality of the writing was very good \u2013 so these errors weren\u2019t overwhelming and didn\u2019t stop me from enjoying the books \u2013 which is saying something, since my editor instincts tend to kick in when I read!So, if you\u2019re looking for a paranormal read with bite, I definitely recommend you pick this series up! I give this second book 4.5/5 stars.***Disclosure: I received these books from the publisher via YA Bound Book Tours in exchange for an honest review.

The plot of the first book was outstanding, but this book surpasses that! There are so many little details that all add up in a big way at the end of this book. I am so impressed with the complexity of these details and how incredibly the author has woven them into this story. I am just so blown away. I can't even imagine how even more intense the third book will be!As with the first book, this book had alternating perspectives. I really love books that are written in this way. It adds so much more to the story when you see things from different points of view. There was even more diversity in book two! Again, mad props to the author for so many diverse characters. It really is a breath of fresh air to read about couples that aren't heterosexual, as most books tend to be. The characters became even more complex in Dark Dreams and Dead Things. I liked the new characters that we introduced and woven into this compelling tale. We get to see new sides of some of the characters as well.The pace in book two was perfect, just like the first book. I didn't want to put it down!In the first book there were a great number of spelling, grammar, and sentence structure errors that dominated the book. Book two still contained many of these errors, but I am glad to say that there are not as many as there was in the first book. Now, the copy of the book that I received was an ARC, so some of these errors may very well have been corrected in the final version. I thought that it was worth mentioning because I downloaded a kindle version of the first book days ago, and there were still an abundance of errors in it. This book also had a lot of dialogue, and not enough descriptive writing. Dark Dreams and Dead Things was just an outstanding story! I am just itching for book three now! These characters stay with you long after you have finished reading. I recommend this book, I really do. The story will not disappoint you! If you are a paranormal or urban fantasy fan then READ.

I received this early to read and review before the author publishes it, and I am honored. It follows the story of a young girl, Ember Lonergan and her paranormal experience with her paranormal cousins and friends and family. (I can\u2019t say too much, because spoilers!).I have missed these characters. So. Much. I only read CSPWDT in March, but from the first sentence of this sequel I was grinning; I was just so happy to be diving back into this world. Honestly? This world, storyline, the characters, they\u2019re one of my favourites. Easily within the top 3. No doubt about it. The sequel picks up where we left off at the end of the first novel, which in my opinion, is great. We didn\u2019t go through a time skip, wondering what would have happened within that time skip of the end of CSPWDT and the beginning of DDADT, it got straight to the point, facing the situations and circumstances the characters were also facing. Also, despite it being a slightly worrying situation, it still had humour which kept the reader intrigued. There is also a nice, quick and short recap to refresh your memory with the events of the previous novel, making sure you\u2019re all caught up. (Something I needed because my memory is awful).Martina has a way to have so much going on, but still manage to make it easy to follow along for the reader, without getting confused. You thought this character has one problem? No no no. They have many more. But you know exactly what they are, and how the characters need to approach them, because it\u2019s so well written and so well thought out. It wasn\u2019t overwhelming to read, it was chill when it needed to be, and thrilling at the right times. Definitely captivating and gripping the reader\u2019s attention at all times. Not only that, but we read in the point of view of multiple characters.I usually struggle with multiple POVs, because sometimes, the writer just can\u2019t separate the character\u2019s enough to make them different and unique. Martina\u2019s characters are complex and each unique; I didn\u2019t have to go back to the start of the chapter to find out whose POV I was in, like I have had to do with previous books. With the end of each chapter came the end (temporarily) of each POV, I was disappointed to be leaving the character for a few chapters but quickly enlightened as I could move onto reading through the eyes of another beloved character. Mace is one of my favourites. Never thought a fictional character could make my chest flutter and my knees weak whenever they say \u2018Luv\u2019.Sometimes at the start of a new chapter I\u2019d have to question, \u2018Is this straight after the events of the previous chapter? Is it a time skip?\u2019 but it didn\u2019t take long for me to figure out, so nothing to complain about really.Another thing I love is that there were times that some readers might think is unnecessary to the plot, but I personally loved it. There was a shopping scene with Kai and Rhys. Martina could have given a quick, brief explanation about it and that\u2019s it. But I love that she shown us that bonding time between the two characters, a relaxed moment in their hectic life (though still in a hectic situation), and I enjoyed it very much. I gave this 5/5 stars. Definitely deserving of all of those stars. I didn\u2019t want to finish this book because that meant I\u2019d have to wait for the next one now.

I never thought a book would ever be able to top Children Shouldn't Play with Dead Things in my favorites list but this book totally did. I was very hopeful that this book would be good but I did not expect it to be this freaking awesome. Not to mention how amazing that cover is, this series has some great cover art. Martina McAtee wrote a very complex story that has characters that make you want to continue reading. I can't believe someone was able to create such a magical, twisted world but I'm so glad she did. I also want to live in it, pretty please! I wanted to take my time reading this and really savor every word but that didn't happen. Once I started I did not want to put it down. I just had to figure out what happened next. This book was full of plot twists that made me want to scream like a banshee. And don't get me started on that ending because I won't stop and I can't spoil this book for everyone else. No matter how badly I want to just pour out every little detail I liked, I will restrain myself.The same group of characters joined us in this book plus a couple new faces thrown in there. I got my Mace back in my life thank goodness, I forgot how much I missed that psychopath. Also Kai, I liked him even more in this book and felt like he got some of the best lines in this whole book. He seriously had me laughing out loud with all that snarkiness. I may have wanted to punch Tristan a lot but I still love her and her bitchiness too. Plus I would never punch her because she would kill me. Even characters that I was supposed to hate I didn't, I just couldn't hate them. Bravo, Martina McAtee for creating such great characters that I can't even hate the bad guys. I really appreciated the character guide at the beginning because I didn't realize how much I had forgotten before that. It all quickly came back to me after reading that guide though. I highly recommend this series and encourage everyone to go out and buy the first one...right now. I will sit here and wait as patiently as humanly possible for book three. Synopsis:17-year-old November Lonergan spent her whole life feeling like an outsider. She was right. She\u2019s a reaper like her mother; like her two cousins, Kai and Tristin. The supernatural world believes they are part of a prophecy to save them from an evil known as the Grove. Ember just wants to survive high school and fix the fallout from bringing back her friend. Old enemies are lurking; waiting for their opportunity to strike but the pack has a new problem. A group of legendary hunters has resurfaced, threatening the reapers and anybody who stands with them. They are making good on their threats too; attacking those closest to the pack.Their only hope of defeating the Legionaries involves trusting a stranger to perform a dangerous spell to advance Ember and her cousin\u2019s powers. But Ember has a secret; a secret she can\u2019t tell the pack. One that leaves the pack vulnerable.An attack on pack allies, leaves one member of the group injured and another missing, along with a mysterious girl named Evangeline who may play a bigger part in this than any of them realize. As the Legionaries are closing in, the pack must trust their enemies, enter hostile territories, and play a dangerous game of cat and mouse with a psychopath. Their entire plan lynches on a dangerous bargain, but rescuing one member of the pack could mean losing another in their place\u2026possibly forever."}, {"userName": "T.W.R.

I\u2019d JUST finished the first book before I started reading, so it wasn\u2019t a huge deal, but because there are so many characters, it really helped refresh my memory when I needed it.I mentioned in my earlier review of book one in the Dead Things series, Children Shouldn\u2019t Play with Dead Things, that I was really excited about it. That being said, Dark Dreams and Dead Things had a lot to live up to after I was blown away by the first one and it DID NOT DISAPPOINT. I tried very hard to take it slow and savor it, but as soon as I started I just couldn\u2019t stop.Book two begins exactly where book one ended, which is nice because there isn't any catching up to do between books. At this point, Ember and her twin cousins, Kai and Tristin, have learned that they need to work together in order to hone their powers and protect their ever-growing family. Quinn\u2019s soul is squatting in Mace\u2019s body, and Mace is a soul without a home who quickly goes missing. The biggest difference between this book and the first for me was Mace. I was left unsure what to think of him after the first book, but after reading this one and learning his backstory, he\u2019s won me over. Again, I mostly wanted to throttle Tristan, but I think that\u2019s part of her charm. I also kind of started to agree with her about Ember and her constant need to drown in self-guilt. (Get it together, girl!) It was nice to see that they finally had a chance to sit down and have it out.I mentioned in my earlier review that I really enjoy the family aspect of this series, and it grew exponentially in this book. I was worried that, because there were already quite a few characters to follow, I would get lost when more and more kept coming, but I never did. I REALLY enjoyed the addition of RJ and I loved his special connection to Rhys.Rhys was another who stood out in terms of character development. I love watching him grow and gain confidence. He and Kai are my absolute favorites.While I really enjoyed all the good guys, I was also struck by the bad ones. The Legionaries, the Grove, Silas, and Finn\u2026they\u2019re all so evil in their different ways, and they add so much to the story by providing all the horrific situations that our main characters need to brave in order to (mostly) stay alive.Ember\u2019s resolution at the end was a strong reminder that she started this story and it\u2019s probably going to be her job to end it. The story is very much not over and I don\u2019t know how I\u2019m going to be able to wait for the next book. It has been such a treat to dive into this world over the last few days and I\u2019m so excited for the journey to continue in the future!"}, {"userName": "Rebecca", "userReviewDate": "Jul 15, 2016", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/54030564-rebecca", "userReview": "I was lucky enough to receive an ARC copy in exchange for an honest reviewSo let\u2019s delve into the deliciousness that Dead Things brings us.

Not bad though, gets your blood pumped for the next installment, which is of course upon us!Now we are at a pivotal point in time for our characters and while the 3 (Kai, Ember, Tristan) figure out how to control their powers, the threat of the Grove, and a coven full of truly heinous mean girls; the rest of the pack has to figure out how to stop a nasty troop of immortal assassins known as the Legionnaires. If that isn\u2019t enough to get your anxiety pumping, they need to find a mysterious witch with a serious power to help them, Ember can\u2019t find Mace\u2026who happens to be in a terrible awful place, Rhys and Kai are trying to deal with emotions (and by now we know how that works out most of the time) .....This book was so jam packed with action that it was hard to believe it was a sequel. Most of the time second books are fillers to move on to the next installment and elicit little emotion from me.

Josephine, the oracle has dropped a bomb on the cousins. They are the reborn \"Trinity.\"If you thought book I was good. Wow, then you need to read book II!! There is action, drama, romance, and a twist that will shake someone to the core!"}, {"userName": "J.A.

It takes off right where the Children Shouldn't play with dead things left off. This book leaves you guessing and you don't want to put it down. The way the book is written you feel like you are a part of it all. I love the characters and getting more of the back story to Mace.

I enjoyed this book as much as the previous and I cannot wait for the next instalment! What I really enjoyed about this book was that it started where the previous one ended. There was no time lapse between events and I think it was done pretty smoothly! It also has a list of who the main people are, who they are connected to, what their powers are and who they are allied with. This was extremely useful because it helped to keep everyone straight. I liked Ember in this book just as much as I liked her in the previous one. She remains an extremely relatable character and I think the author has done a good job of showing her long term reaction to what has happened and how it affected her mentally and physically! It definitely makes her even more relatable in this sense. I still didn't ship the ship that appears to be sailing where Ember is concerned and I just... I want someone else for her! I just don't know who yet! I was also really glad that we got to know more about Mace! In the first book, he was an extremely enigmatic character and we didn't really find out much about him or his past in the first book! I am so glad we got to explore some of his past in this book because the mystery was killing me! I definitely think this insight into his character made him all the more relatable and definitely likeable in a different sense because you begin to sorry for him as a reader! As a reiteration of my review of book #1, I TOTALLY SHIP THE SHIP!!! Kai and Rhys are even MORE adorable in this book because of RJ!!!!!!!!!! I love them and I always look forward to seeing more from them within the book and ... let's just say... I am waiting for the Sexual Tension (Yes it deserves caps) to finally be addressed because I SHIP IT!!! AND I WANT IT AND I SHIP IT... ughOk, there is something that needs to be addressed here. Silas. If anyone who is reading this has read the books or is part of Martina's Deadlings on fb, you will understand the ongoing feud that is Silas. If anyone was wondering on which side of the spectrum I fall, it would be #TeamSilas. I really really liked his character and I definitely view him as someone who is misunderstood! I cannot wait to see more of him in the next book! I loved the introduction of all the new characters! They all brought something new and unique to the table and I am really looking forward to seeing how their characters develop as the series goes on... The Plot of this book also kept up with the character development that happened. There was always something happening and it was just one thing after another and it really helped to keep me on my toes and to keep me turning the pages just to see what was going to happen next!All in all I really enjoyed myself reading this book and I am definitely looking forward to the next instalment - especially after that ending!! I gave this book 5/5 stars."}, {"userName": "Jenny Bynum Black Words-White Pages", "userReviewDate": "Sep 20, 2017", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/6425711-jenny-bynum-black-words-white-pages", "userReview": "Read my full review at https://blackwords-whitepages1977.blo...What an unexpected turn of events this story had.

Second books usually suffer from second book syndrome where they are a total let down and serve as nothing but fluff until book 3 gets here, or they have great plot points but too much filler just to stretch the story out enough to need that third book.THANKFULLY, I found neither of those things in this book! Hooray! What I liked: We get to learn more about Mace and his backstory. There is murder, mayhem, and betrayal from the most unlikely of places, (or were they...) Also, RJ. Just sayin'.What could use improvement: I said this about the last book and I will say it again. It is NOT necessary to place whose point of view it is at the top of the chapter when writing in third person. Third person is all knowing and all seeing, and just by reading the chapter, we will see easily who the chapter is about. Having the names there is annoying and redundant. Just my editor opinion and personal quirk of mine. But, since the editing and proofreading in this book showed improvement from the previous one, I didn't take off any star ratings for it. Martina McAtee is a talented story teller which a penchant for tying together many different characters into one immense plot. I highly recommend her books."}, {"userName": "Wendy McDowell", "userReviewDate": "Mar 31, 2017", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/50542587-wendy-mcdowell", "userReview": "Wow!The first book of this series was great, but this one makes it even better!

What I find most interesting is the world where the story took place in- a world where witches, werewolves, reapers, banshee exist. That is what has first drawn me to this series. This world is filled with so much possibilities in the direction which the future plot may progress and I found that really exciting as a reader.Quinn\u2019s character development is probably what I enjoyed the most in this sequel. It\u2019s entertaining to watch his character evolve and attempt to embrace his new identity. Quinn is slowly becoming my favourite character. I really feel for Quinn and the struggle he had to deal with because of a decision made for him.What I didn\u2019t like about the book could be summed up into one word: Tristin. She really annoyed me throughout my read. If I could reach out and just strangle some sense into that banshee, believe me I would. I just can\u2019t accept the way she treats Quinn, especially after what she\u2019d done. And she was so horrible to Ember even when her anger towards Ember was often times uncalled for. I do hope there would be some character growth for Tristin as this series continue, at least so that she doesn\u2019t get on my nerve as much.I am pleased with how \u2018Dark Dreams and Dead Things\u2019 ended. The final scene was great and it left me curious of what\u2019s to come. There\u2019s still so much story to uncover. I, for one, would love to know more of Neoma\u2019s past. I am also intrigued by Donovan and would love to see more of him in the next book.*Review first posted on my blog."}, {"userName": "Sherry Fundin", "userReviewDate": "Jul 10, 2016", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/9198006-sherry-fundin", "userReview": "I have been eagerly anticipating the second book in the Dead Things series, Dark Dreams and Dead Things by Martina McAtee, even since I read the first book, Children Shouldn\u2019t Play with Dead Things. The covers are so amazingly creative, I would grab the book for that reason alone.Dark Dream and Dead Things by Marina McAtee picks up where Children Shouldn\u2019t Play with Dead Things left off in this dark magical world.The prophecy is yet to be fulfilled by the Triad, Ember, Tristan and Kai. The teenagers can barely control their powers, yet they jump in with both feet. It\u2019s not like they have a choice.There is humor in their dark world. For example, Kai is helping Ember dress and talking about her boobs\u2026the writing cracked me up. Kai and Rhys, with the baby werewolf, is hilarious and sweet. Another example of the fun writing: If Rhys had to carry her to the car, he didn\u2019t want her waking up and chewing on his boyfriend like a squeaky toy.Witches, wolves, fae, a one-eyed dog and a resurrected cat all live and love in the same home. The danger surrounds them and it is hard to know who to trust. Who will live and who will die?A very deep and dark look into the paranormal and supernatural world. The characters also struggle with real world issues, like love and getting through the teenage years.I felt like I stepped into an episode of Supernatural.The story is not over and the series needs to be read in order to get the full picture.I received a copy of Dark Dreams and Dead Things by Martina McAtee in return for an honest review."}], "description": "17-year-old November Lonergan spent her whole life feeling like an outsider.
