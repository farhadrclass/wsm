So, I have a thing for novels about artists. This book alternates between two time periods. The first is 1936 in Juan-les-Pins during the time Picasso was creating his Minotaur series. The second is modern day, as the granddaughter of the cook researches the prior period. It helps to have access to visuals. Thank God for Google and being able to view the paintings in question. It's almost a shame novels like this can't include pictures of the art. At first, Ondine, the main character, seems to be more conduit than real person. She is the eyes into Picasso\u2019s life, but she seems almost two dimensional. At the beginning, the author does a better job describing the meals than her thoughts. It's not until she becomes the subject of his paintings that her thoughts become meaningful and she seems real. The second story of Ondine\u2019s granddaughter, also takes a while to become interesting. But a siblings\u2019 fight over their parents\u2019 finances rang very true. And at that point, as Celine goes on the hunt for her grandmother\u2019s story and possible treasure, the plot line picks up. A recurring theme is the lack of equality between the sexes. Picasso was not a believer in women as equals and saw them solely as a means to satisfy his needs. Pure and simple, he was a misogynist. To quote him \u201cyour job is to remain by my side, to devote yourself to me and the children. Whether it makes you happy or unhappy is no concern of mine.\u201d Celine\u2019s father is worse, as he is also abusive. Once things get going, this is a fast and easy read, a little heavy on coincidences. I can't say that it totally grabbed me. It was the kind of book you didn\u2019t regret having to put down.My thanks to netgalley and RH Ballantine for an advance copy of this book."}, {"userName": "Cindy Burnett", "userReviewDate": "May 13, 2016", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/2445617-cindy-burnett", "userReview": "2.5I want to start my review by saying that I expected to love this book. I loved the last series that this author wrote, writing as CA Belmond, starting with A Rather Lovely Inheritance. I also have a great fascination with art and artists so I fully expected that this would be the book for me. However, sadly it was not. The story takes place across the decades, the modern story completely in 2016 and the historic part starting in 1936 until shortly before the main character in 2016 is born. Both women are weak and not very likeable. Celine, the main character in 2016, cannot even stand up to her step siblings and lets them ferry her own mother away (step mother to the step siblings) with hardly a word and no action. Meanwhile she goes to France with her aunt on a trip the sick mother was supposed to take. Huh?! Meanwhile back in the 1930\u2019s, Ondine vacillates between being free spirited as she engages in a relationship (if you can call it that) with Picasso and silly and lacking a backbone.Another part of the story that did not ring true for me was the dialogue between Picasso and Ondine. It was awkward and stilted, and I just can\u2019t believe he spoke that way. Picasso was not portrayed kindly, and that viewpoint I did find more realistic. He struggled in his personal life, and the author portrays this accurately. I am sorry I did not like this book more. Thanks to NetGalley and the publisher for the opportunity to read it in exchange for an honest review."}, {"userName": "Mollie", "userReviewDate": "May 19, 2016", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/2675284-mollie", "userReview": "Aubrey's painterly writing style awakens the senses to the beauty of the South of France, to the sensuality of a multi flavored meal, to the brush caressing the canvas. The reader is seduced by Picasso while being repelled by him at the same time. His story includes the effects of war and abusive relationships along with his passion for painting.The author teases the reader with a mystery that, if solved, will be life-changing. How will betrayal and abuse affect the process? Will the solution, if found at all, come too late? The reader's only solution is to upkeep turning the page. My one disappointment was that I found myself caring more about the grandmother..her character seemed more fleshed out. Since it was the granddaughter who was faced with solving the mystery, I wish I could have felt drawn to her.

Told in 2 timelines, we have Ondine in the 1930's in a lovely seaside town in France. She is willful, and not satisfied with what life has handed to her. Her fiancee disappears while trying to raise money to marry her, and she slaves at her parents' cafe, hoping he'll return, and that her life will be different one day. Picasso is in hiding in that town, and she takes him lunch daily and a relationship develops. I have to say this. The sexual relationship made me feel a bit \"icky\". Ondine is, after all, only 17. The fact that she was not a virgin is the only thing that made me not throw up when the old man takes her as his lover. Although it still made me feel kind of dirty. He really was horrible to women, and the author was brutally honest about that. That being said, Ondine's eventual pregnancy is what made the whole book work.Her grandaughter Celine is in the current story line, and she is trying to save her mother from her horrible siblings greedy grasp as well as trying to find a priceless painting of Ondine painted and \"gifted\" (for lack of a better word) by Picasso himself.There are some parralels with me and this book. I am also embroiled in a legal battle with my siblings over custody of my mother who is in a nursing home. I also happened to grow up in beauiful New Rochelle, NY. I love to cook and dream of living in a lovely seaside town someday. These things made this book more personal for me. Ah, if I only had a hidden Picasso somwhere to solve my problems and rescue my \"Maman\" sigh.... :)The older storyline was my favorite. I loved Ondine and her passionate love for Luc and little Julia, and for her cooking. Aubray's writing is really good, the descriptions brought everything alive for me, fragrances, tastes, emotions. Her characters were all wonderful in their own way. Celine's storyline was definitely more modern, and vaguely reminded me of \"Stephanie Plum meets Gordon Ramsey\". Hers had more humor, more sass. I really loved this one."}, {"userName": "Martie Nees Record", "userReviewDate": "Jun 24, 2016", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/4793025-martie-nees-record", "userReview": "The novel is actually two stories. Yes, it alternates in time but it also seems to be of two different genres; a romance novel and a historical fiction. One is narrated by a current day young American woman who goes to France to find a long lost treasure of her French grandmother\u2019s. She enrolls in a cooking class, finds love with a bad boy chef (who of course has a heart of gold like most romance novels dictate), while embarking on an utterly unrealistic adventure. It reads so saccharine I might never need to add sugar in my coffee again. I feel that the title belongs to the current day part of the book; a chick lit cooking/love blog.The second and much more interesting story was narrated by the grandmother. As a seventeen year old girl she actually was cooking for Pablo Picasso. In 1936 Picasso left Paris for the French Riviera in order to escape his chaotic life caused by the friction between his wife and his mistress. And there was nothing Picasso loved more than pitting one of his women against the other. During his hiatus of Paris, the young budding chef also became his model and his lover. The author captures the artist\u2019s complete and total misogynist nature (and I read \u201cThe Private Journal of Fernande Olivier\u201d who was one of his first loves.) The author did not exaggerate his brutish treatment of women. Aubray also gets into his genius which went hand in hand with his narcissism that fueled his behavior. But the grandmother\u2019s story is not really about the great artist. It\u2019s about a girl becoming a woman in wartime France, immigrating to America, and how her love of cooking good food encouraged her to discover her sensuality. Unlike many, she led a full life enabling her to die without regrets. Surely, such a story deserves a more serious title.

At it's heart is the young and spirited 16-year old Ondine helping out in her parents' restaurant Caf\u00e9 Paradis where she cycles daily taking one of their spectacular luncheons to a mysterious guest from Paris, an artist who is going by his family name of Ruiz but is the famous Pablo Picasso. Ondine begins to prepare a cookbook with the recipes and notes of Picasso's comments to tweak the recipes with a Spanish twist to these traditional Provencal recipes. We also meet Celine as she comes to the Cote d' Azur to explore the mysteries of her grandmother Ondine and her mother Julie as she takes a cooking class in the village where her grandmother lived to try to resolve the mystery of whether Picasso painted a portrait of Ondine those many years ago. If you love art, the Cote d' Azur, Provencal cooking and a sweet story, this is it.\"For, no matter how many times I see this view, I still catch my breath at the way the Riviera's intense-but-soft sun fires up every color it touches to dazzling perfection: the pomegranate-red tiled roofs on candy-colored stone houses snuggled against terraced hills; the green of dense pine that clings to the shoreline and mountains; and most of all, blue--that infinite canopy of cobalt-blue sky over my head, and a wide-open aquamarine sea lapping at the shores, each reaching out to the other until they meet in a blurry watercolor embrace at a violet-blue horizon.\""}, {"userName": "Marjorie", "userReviewDate": "Feb 16, 2017", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/32379875-marjorie", "userReview": "This book is a complete imagining of what might have transpired during a short period of Picasso\u2019s life. It\u2019s true that Picasso took some time away from society in Paris in the spring of 1936. He anonymously rented a villa in the French Riviera. He was going through some nasty marital problems (having a mistress didn\u2019t help there) and he hadn\u2019t been able to paint for months but that spring he was able to paint again. Most of Picasso\u2019s paintings referenced in the book are real except for one.I had so believed that I would love this book. I find the art world a fascinating one and love to read about France. And French cooking \u2013 what\u2019s not to love? But I should have known better. I know the reputation Picasso has and feel rather dumb for thinking this would be a charming book actually about cooking for Picasso. Sure, the main character, Ondine, did cook for him but their relationship didn\u2019t stop there. He was 54 and she was only 17. I felt so let down when the story took this turn. It felt far too obvious to me and I had hoped that this would be a different type of book. Apparently, cooking for Picasso = modeling for Picasso = sleeping with Picasso. What else is a young girl to do being around such a great artist? Ho hum.Of course, there\u2019s much more to the story than that. There\u2019s also the story of Ondine\u2019s granddaughter, Celine, who, when she learns that her grandmother once cooked for Picasso, decides to visit the place where Picasso and Ondine met, sort out a fight for an inheritance and search for a possibly missing painting. And there are lovely descriptions of France and its cooking. But although parts of the book were in fact as charming as I had thought they would be, it wasn\u2019t enough to save this one for me.I did enjoy looking at the photos on the author\u2019s website at www.camilleaubray.com of the places that inspired some of the locations in her book.This audio book was given to me by the publisher through Blogging for Books in return for an honest review."}, {"userName": "Jordan", "userReviewDate": "Jan 10, 2017", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/31258408-jordan", "userReview": "This is the story about two women of the same family, living in different times and separate continents, who are connected by blood in history. The narration alternates between 17-year-old Ondine, a cook at her family's caf\u00e9 in a small town on the French Riviera in 1936, and Celine, Ondine's granddaughter, who lives in present day California and learns from her ailing mother that Grandma Ondine once cooked exclusively for the great and notorious Picasso. With her mother's health in rapid decline, Celine finds herself traveling to the small town of Juan-les-Pins, France, in hopes to uncover the mysteries of her family's history and determine what part the great painter, if any, played in her grandmother Ondine's life and legacy. This was my first introduction to author, Camille Aubray, and I was pleased to find she is an absolutely exquisite writer. I listened to the audio version of 'Cooking for Picasso' on CD and it was such a beautiful and relaxing experience that I was truly sad when the book was over. I primarily listen to audiobooks while driving in my car and I found myself purposefully taking longer routes and remaining in my vehicle even after reaching my destination in order to continue listening to this eloquent novel. Aubray's descriptive style and attention to detail made me feel like I was on holiday in the French Riviera, at a caf\u00e9 in a little seaside village, enjoying authentic French cuisine, cooked to order and prepared with love. My boyfriend is an inspiring chef who recently returned to school for a degree in culinary arts and he listened to most of this book along with me (which isn't at all typical behavior for him) and he was completely captivated by all the references to food preparation and cooking and all the detailed descriptions of French meals and the ingredients included to make them, as was I. Overall, this book was an absolute joy and I feel I must give credit not only to the author, but also to the talented narrator, Mishandled Marino, who did a wonderful job giving voice to these three-dimensional, complex, characters and really bringing the story to life. The only complaint I have is a very minor one and more of a technical issue then one with the writing itself and that is that I felt like the narration speed was extremely slow and I would have liked the narrator to pick up the pace significantly because at times it felt like it was being read in slow motion to me. However, after a while I was able to adjust, somewhat, but I normally get my audio books from Audible, where I have the option of adjusting the narration speed and I normally set it to x1.5 or x2, when listening. But again, that is just a personal preference and, of course, no fault of the authors so it did not affect my ratings for this book to which I happily gave five out of five stars! I highly recommend this book, especially to those readers who enjoy beautifully descriptive writing, art lovers, or \"foodies.\" Bon app\u00e9ti!I received a complimentary copy of 'Cooking for Picasso' from Blogging for Books in exchange for my honest, unbiased review."}, {"userName": "Debra", "userReviewDate": "Jan 07, 2017", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/28115666-debra", "userReview": "If you are a Francophile and food and art lover, you will adore Cooking for Picasso by Camille Aubray.I received a free audio book from Blogging for Books for this review. All opinions, exclamations, gushings and rants are my own.Let me just say that I didn\u2019t realize I would receive an audio book and was a bit disappointed when it came in the mail. My mood soon changed. Since it was the holiday season and I had no time to read, I popped the first CD in the car and I was soon hooked. (This unabridged version is 13 1/2 hours long.) The book is narrated by Mozhan Marno, an actress whom I was familiar with from The Blacklist and House of Cards. Her voice is so melodic that I was wishing my drive to work every morning would go on and on.Aubray\u2019s tale is told from two points of view and covers three generations of women:1. Ondine, first portrayed as a young woman whom we follow into her sixties.2. Julie, Ondine\u2019s daughter.3. Celine, Julie\u2019s daughter, a thirty-something Hollywood make-up artist.The flashbacks of Grandmother Ondine\u2019s tale are told in third-person. Celine tells her story in first-person. The action of the novel swaps back and forth between Celine\u2019s modern world (set in New York, Nevada, and France) with Ondine\u2019s tale of the mid-thirties in the quaint village of Juan-les-Pins.Where does Picasso figure into this tale? The young Ondine cooked for Picasso when he spent time on the Riviera. She starts out as a personal chef but is soon posing for Picasso.Many years later, Ondine\u2019s granddaughter, Celine, treks to the same French town to seek the truth about her grandmother\u2019s connection with Picasso. She is also there to hopefully find a better life for her mother, Julie. Celine finds herself in an upscale cooking class (accompanied by her Aunt Matilda) taught by a Gordon Ramsey-like chef.There are lots of French delicacies and good hearty peasant food in the novel, but it was hard for me to keep up with all the food as I was driving and listening. Honestly, as the intrigue and drama (and heartache) escalated in the novel, I found myself forgetting to notice the food as I was swept away by the story. (This tale is vast and encompasses 1936-2016 and settings of France, Monaco, Las Vegas, New York City, and New Rochelle.)If you have a long drive ahead of you pick up this audio book. If you have a few days to spend on the French Riviera, you might also want to pick up the novel and become entranced with the lives of Ondine, Julie and Celine.You can see my full review at Cooking For Picasso: A Book Review"}, {"userName": "Nese", "userReviewDate": "Jun 17, 2016", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/38389267-nese", "userReview": "I received a free copy of this book through Goodreads First Reads in exchange for a fair review.I was lost in the story and enjoyed reading this book so much that I could hardly put it down. Although I don\u2019t care for stories going back and forth in time, two parallel time lines expanding from 1936 to 2016, covering the lives of four generations of women, great grandmother, grandmother, mother, and the daughter, is done so skillfully and personality traits of each woman are portrayed so intimately, one feels like living events in the lives of the characters instead of reading them in the pages of a book. What is so exceptional is the way the complexities of the characters\u2019 personalities and the twists and turns of their lives are written. Normally the real life is so complex and so unpredictable that most novels don\u2019t come close to capturing the complexities of real life, unlike this book which does an amazing job of doing just that. The story telling, the intricate details of the feelings of the characters, and psychologically consistent personality descriptions make this book a pleasure to read.

I am not a gourmet cook, unfortunately, because this review just calls for all kinds of adjectives that refers to cooking; however, having said that, this is a story of cooking, art, and love told through the past as well as the present.1936--In a small village in southern France, a seventeen-year-old girl is recruited by her parents to cook and then deliver lunch daily to a new patron, a mysterious man by the name of Ruiz. Bicycling up one of the steep hills of Juan-les-Pins, Ondine finally meets the man, Picasso, who is hiding out from everyone. Over time, she meets Matisse and Cocteau, but ends up modeling (and a bit more) for Picasso.2014--Celine, Ondine's granddaughter, has heard stories from her mother Julie about her grandmother; at age thirty, she hears about Ondine, Picasso, and a mysterious painting. With her mother in a nursing home following a stroke, Celine travels to France in her mother's place with her aunt for a cooking class, and to search for this painting, that is, if it really exists. Just a well-constructed story that brings three generations of women together in a story that all are connected to an enigmatic artist and his art. Added to that, there are French cuisine references throughout (just reading the story, I think a few pounds were added to this reader's waistline), and lovely impressionistic pictures of southern France were painted.Overall, recommended for anyone who has interest in gourmet cooking, art, and love for ultimately it is a love story written in a historical context of the missing years of Picasso. Could it be a chance encounter with a young woman was enough to spark a new period for this artist? This novel answers this question, and a bit more. Quotes to remember/consider:\"Yes, we cook and eat things that were once alive--be they vegetables or animals--in order to stoke the fire of life in us; but in return, we must keep our end of the bargain, which is to handle them humanely with great respect; and when it's our turn to die, we should do so gracefully and willingly, so that we, too, feed the fiery furnace of the earth's future plants and creatures.\" (p. 267) a more extensive review to be posted at www.pedometergeek.wordpress.com"}, {"userName": "Elizabeth", "userReviewDate": "Mar 18, 2017", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/10019229-elizabeth", "userReview": "The setting for most of this book is Juan-les-Pins, a small town outside Antibes, in Southeastern France on the Cote d'Azur. This is where Picasso retreated to in 1936, during a tumultuous period in his personal life in which he actually stopped painting! What inspired him to pick up his paintbrush in the South of France? Was it the scenery? Or maybe it was the Bouillabaisse! Camille Aubray would have you believe it was the delicious Provencal cuisines... and the chef preparing the sumptuous meals... that inspired Picasso during this reclusive period and gave him back his zest for life. Within the year, he would create his masterpiece, Guernica. But the book is not so much about Picasso as it is about our young chef, Ondine, and the effect those months of interacting and cooking for Picasso had on her life, and the future lives of her daughter and granddaughter. Aubray weaves two stories, the first of Ondine, the young chef, the second, her granddaughter, Celine. Their stories eventually converge, much like the sensuous herbs in a Provencal stew, and the blend makes the story much richer. Naturally, the cuisine of Southern France is what unites these two tales. Ondine leaves her granddaughter a notebook of recipes and a diary of her time cooking for Picasso. Celine traces her roots back to the Cote d'Azur, and meets a chef who has taken over the Mas where Ondine retired. I won't tell you where the story then leads, because I don't want to spoil it....I did a bit of side research while reading this book, on Picasso's art during this period, his marriage to ballerina Olga Khokhlova, as well as his infamous love affairs with Marie-Theresa Walter and Dora Maar. Two of the paintings that were created during this time (and which Aubray muses were modeled by our heroine, Ondine) are Femme \u00e0 la montre and Woman at the Window."}, {"userName": "Suze", "userReviewDate": "Jun 06, 2017", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/6344283-suze", "userReview": "This book was selected for our book club by a member who is a real foodie and in this way the book satisfies. (She cooked us a tr\u00e8s d\u00e9licieux 6-course French dinner based on food descriptions in the book.) I found the story of three generations of French women separated through eight decades rather melodramatic. The plot stretched my credibility with umpteen coincidences and characters who were two-dimensional, either hero or villain. The most developed character was Picasso as we saw various facets of his personality. I had not known of Picasso\u2019s private tendencies of misogynist bullying with his wife and harem of mistresses throughout his life. If you\u2019re a genius, they don\u2019t call you a pervert.

Partly because it was an audiobook and those always take longer to listen to than for me to read, but also because it just felt like a really long book to me. I'm not a huge fan of literary fiction. I want to be and keep trying it, but it's rarely fantastical enough for me. But even though I admit this one was a pretty good one there was still a fairly long bit in the middle that lagged. The beginning is engrossing and by the time the red herons start toward to end, I was interested again. But the middle seemed to go on interminably.I also so desperately wanted this to be some other story than a rebellious girl meets an older famous man and sleeps with him. Granted, there is more to the story than this. But it is essentially this story and I didn't want it to be more, I wanted it to be different, less cliched. This feeling only worsened when one of the characters is sexually victimized late in the book. I saw why the author did it, what changes it brought about, but it is just such an overused plot device. My disappointment was severe to find two such trite tropes in the same book.The writing is beautiful. The mystery kept me guessing. It had a someone pat happy ending, but it is happy.
