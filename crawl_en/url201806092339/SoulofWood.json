To escape from hell he promised everything.\u2019We are all endowed with a survival instinct whose gears whir up at the borderlines of life and death and bestow blinders on our rationality to keep the goal of survival-at-all-costs the only clear victory. Jakov Lind\u2019s superb short story collection Soul of Wood examines morality through it\u2019s ugly and sinister negation, delivering seven sadistic and deeply allegorical stories following those who trade morality to prolong their mortality. These are unflinching stories bearing shadows of the holocaust and the only comfort therein is the dark humor that keeps you laughing through the onslaught of degradation, a laughter that sounds strangely like the creaking and cracking of a soul in a storm. With a biting wit=and wild prose that exemplifies the untamed and savage human heart, Lind\u2019s vivid imaginative vision has the reader running like cockroaches into the dark recesses of humanity to survive in an untamed realm where the sunshine of morality can\u2019t be counted on to light the way.Jakov Lind has a style all of his own that makes Soul of Wood all the more haunting and surreal. He trains his eye on the darkness of reality, yet adds fleeting textures of magical-realism that gives the journey a feel like being in the deep, dark woods of fairy-tales; is it purely the horrors of imagination lurking in the shadows or is there something inexplicable afoot summoned from hell by the evils of Man. Populated by a cast of characters ranging through Nazis, priest, cannibals and convicted killers, and powered by allegorical moral undercurrents, Lind has created what almost feels like a Grimm\u2019s collection of the World War II era. His writing style is also reflective of the human wilderness, keeping his prose sly and dodgy like a man on the run. His dialogue is particularly interesting, containing multiple character's speech and interior monologues within the larger paragraph of ideas without use of quotation marks as guide-posts to separate them. It is slightly stylistically different yet thematically similar to the way Jos\u00e9 Saramago uses dialogue to tie characters to the natural world and emphasize the discombobulation of reality. A perfect example of Lind\u2019s flair can be seen here, a paragraph concerning a man convincing a taxi driver to take him and his large crate which secretly contains a young jewish boy whom he is charged with hiding:\nWhat you got in the crate? shouted the driver into the mirror. Wohlbrecht\u2019s first impulse was to tell him to go to hell, but foresight is better that hindsight. If I say dishes, Wohlbrecht reflected, he\u2019s the kind to get suspicious...it\u2019s the innocent things that make people suspicious. My mother-in-law cut up in little pieces! The driver grinned. That old cripple is O.K. He decided to come down to twenty-five marks. You killed her first, I hope? You think I\u2019m crazy? Wohlbrecht called back. Too much like work. I did it the other way. The driver laughed till his teeth almost fell out of his mouth. I can\u2019t ask him for more than twenty. What a character. Live and let live, that was the driver\u2019s motto\u2026\nLind contains everything into one block of an idea, forcing the reader to swallow a heightened emotional punch rather than sustaining it across line breaks. It also reveals Lind\u2019s ability to deftly sashay between perspectives, threading in and out of multiple characters points-of-view in order to pull everything together in an impressive manner. His ability to present all perspectives\u2014from character\u2019s to the authorial\u2014without denoting them as such with punctuation removes all boundaries and makes his stories not about one person but all people and the world around them.\u2018See, he shouted, you\u2019ve made an ass of yourself for life. Look who wants to live.\u2019World War II brought horrors all across Europe, affecting all and leaving the scars of survival in the hearts and souls of those who made it through to the other side. The title-novella, a near perfect story that makes the book worth reading alone, satirizes the will to live for those caught in the wars clutches. Crippled veteran Wolbrecht finds any method to survive wherever he can, even working as a double agent between two rival doctors at the insane asylum in which he is placed. The two Nazi doctors spend the war putting inmates to death to meet their high daily quota of injections, and plotting ways to find themselves holding the syringe against the arm of the other. As the war is drawing to a close, they set aside their differences and team up to find the Jewish boy Wolbrecht hid in the mountains years before in hopes that protecting one will save them from execution after the inevitable war trials. Survival, it seems, comes before any sense of right and wrong. They are willing to betray their fellow man when doing so keeps them in good favor, washing their hands of murder in the name of duty, and their act of saving someone is not an expression of goodwill but simple survival. They are even willing to kill in order to save. In the story Ressurection, two men live like rats in a tiny space within a wall to escape the Nazis, showing the amazing feats a human is capable of in order to survive.Lind asks us what use is survival, what good is life? in a world where such unspeakable horrors can be held as commonplace.\nWhat have you got to look forward to in Paris? Paris is only a city. Whom do you need anyway, and who needs you? You\u2019re going to Paris. Well, what of it? Sex and drinking won\u2019t make you any happier. And certainly working won\u2019t. Money won\u2019t do you a particle of good. What are you getting out of life?\nThe will to survive keeps the reader empathizing with many of the characters, but Lind frequently reminds us that they are choosing to survive in a world that he continually paints as a disgusting, disturbing and depressing place, a world where the government decides who is suitable for life: \u2018those who had no papers entitling them to live lined up to die.\u2019 Cannibalism is a common theme in several stories, used as a metaphor of human interaction: the strong kill and eat the weak to survive. If you don\u2019t do that which disgusts you,\u2019 says the cannibal in Journey Through the Night, \u2019what becomes of your disgust? It sticks in your throat. Nothing sticks in the throat of the man from Sankt Polten. He swallows all. In Hurrah for Freedom we see a nudist family of cannibals (you read that correctly) that eats their children and has a dead horse hung from the rafters, insisting that once it has rotted to a skeleton that their home country of Lithuania will be free. They are prideful of their ways, a lifestyle depicted as most revolting, simply because their lifestyle means they do not have to live under Russian occupation.Religion figures prominently into many of these stories, and often in unique and surprising ways. There are many theological discussions between characters that are revealing into their hearts. In The Pious Brother, a darkly humorous story featuring an attractive young actress who can only achieve sexual gratification by seducing priests, an aging German Princess expresses her disgust at the common depictions of Jesus.\nI want to know why our Savior is always represented as a soft, gently, I might almost say effeminate man. A man who could chase the moneychangers out of the temple with a whip, who had the physical strength to carry His own cross up a mountain, cannot possibly have looked like that. I refuse to think of him as a weakling.\nThe Princess disgusts the priest as she takes pride in having sent all her sons off to die as members of the S.S. It is no surprise then that she would only love a Jesus depicted as strong and mighty, a Jesus that could properly represent the Third Reich. Her sort of God is found later in stories like The Window, where God walks among man as a gangster of sorts, employing terrorists and offering miracles in order to take men\u2019s souls under threat of a knife-blade.Highly original and darkly allegorical, Jakov Lind\u2019s stories are an absolute delight. The themes are similar to those found in his intensely amazing Landscape in Concrete, yet the multiple stories allow Lind to assess the ideas for a wider ranging array of perspectives. The title-novella is one of the best stories I have read in a long time and has a startling and stunning conclusion that won\u2019t soon be forgotten. This collection is powerful and disturbing, yet sooths with a humor that makes you laugh aloud, yet then wonder about your own morality if such notions can be regarded as funny. This is a perfect collection and one best suited for those who wish to stare into the abyss, for when the abyss stares back all you can do is laugh and laugh and laugh.5/5\u2018I\u2019ve got to eat you. In the first place I\u2019m hungry, and in the second place I like you. I told you right off that I like you and you thought, the guy is queer. But now you know. I\u2019m a simple cannibal. It\u2019s not a profession, it\u2019s a need.\u2019"}, {"userName": "Ben Winch", "userReviewDate": "Jun 17, 2015", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/5647943-ben-winch", "userReview": "Another book I read months back and am only now coming to reflect on, consequently I can\u2019t say much in detail. One thing though: it didn\u2019t enthrall me. It was good, and true, and truly its author\u2019s own, but it seemed such a random flight of fancy at times that I almost let it go, let it glide away weightless to realms where I didn\u2019t care to follow. Or no: weightless? Clearly not. A wartime tale about a paralysed Jewish kid minded by an ex-army cripple with a persecution complex? There\u2019s weight here, plenty of it. But the mystical stuff on the mountain with the kid while his erstwhile protector struggled through endemic corruption back in the city trying to fence his booty \u2013 all that seemed such a left-turn it might almost be another story. I didn\u2019t wanna follow the cripple, I guess; I wanted to stay with the kid, and for the kid not to be a fairy story. But what the hell: it could just be me. The prose was good: sparse, brutal; it cut to the chase. But the whole thing left me mystified more than moved. Could be I\u2019ll give it another try, but on the basis of this novella and a couple of dark-as-pitch short stories I\u2019m guessing that, for now at least, Lind isn\u2019t quite my style."}, {"userName": "Chuck LoPresti", "userReviewDate": "Aug 09, 2012", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/2457963-chuck-lopresti", "userReview": "The most potent writing I've read in a long while. Lind is really unique and powerful. His language (in translation of course) is clear and fairly simple but vibrant and never anything less than incisive and essential. There is a very powerful mind at work here. At times he reminds me of Bruno Schulz in that both seamlessly transition into fantastic movements with graceful ease. But it's only in the language itself that you'll find much beauty in Lind. He's not a horror writer but he's horrifying in the same way that Wisconsin Death Trip seeps into your conscious and slowly unravels your sense of sanity with stunning efficacy. What is it about those that matured in the 50s that produced the likes of Gein, Fish and Lind? All three were acutely interested in the limits of human cruelty and thankfully Lind left his interests to his imagination. Soul of Wood is a book that impacts your senses so acutely you swear you smell his words. The magic in Lind is in the way that exterior reality transmogrifies into dream-like hallucinatory horror. Nudist families eat children and measure time in the ossification of horses instead of clocks. Murderers chat you up about how you'll taste and coax you to let them pre-salt your flesh. A very personal understanding of religion results in suicide as a means to insult as god is redefined throughout these collected stories. Those that have experienced hallucination know that lack of previously understood reality isn't mere obfuscation but a heightening of the senses that creates an alternate reality. Lind feels each breath, each step with this type of heightened clarity that boils over into the fantastic. If you're familiar with Caroliner, Lind should be familiar in theme to you. Organic decay results in the ergot spores that when ingested seem to infect the rural hallucination that informs Lind as well. Intuitive and visceral - Lind's book charges right at your senses and shakes you powerfully. This is definitely one of the most interesting and powerful short story writers I know. This is not for the faint of heart and I imagine more than one reader collapsed in retreat faced with some of Lind's ideas. If you know what men like Albert Fish and Ed Gein did to other humans - you'll be better braced for reading Lind. Disease, war, TB and human sexuality are rendered with Caroliner's day glow funhouse palette to great effect. This is a quick but far from easy read that will thrill you if it doesn't please you at least. No odder than Gilgamesh or Gargantua and no less horrifying than Panzram or Fish - Soul of Wood will leave you a changed reader.If you're interested in hearing Caroliner - avoid Youtube and BUY a record - sit with the awesome lyric sheet and be prepared to forget your previous opinions about music. Start with Cooking Stove Beast or Rise of The Common Woodpile - or maybe Banknotes Dreams Signatures. If you're too stubbornly opposed to that - at least Youtube non-live tracks and scope out the lyric sheets here: http://www.doomsdaycreativeenterprise... - start with the early stuff. I'm off to find more Lind."}, {"userName": "Annelies", "userReviewDate": "Oct 07, 2016", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/23628601-annelies", "userReview": "The title story is the most important in this book. It's a story that learns us how people can change their opinions and behaviour concerning the party they belong too. One does everything to survive; even betrayal has a part in it. It's a story about how the insane where treated during WO II; the special treatment they get which meams a lethal injection and how doctors where forced to get their daily quotum. It shows us how small the line between good and bad is. The central theme in whole the book was death in all its unimagibale forms. Most of the stories where dark in character and left bad and uneasy feelings.I prefered the main story, the title story. If the rating was for that story alone, I think I would have rated it 4 stars.

(1962; Eng. trans. 1964). Jakov Lind. ****.\tThis book consists of a novella, \u201cSoul of Wood,\u201d and six short stories. The true focus is the novella, with the short stories being, in my opinion, of relatively minor significance. In \u201cSoul of Wood,\u201d we meet Wohlbrecht, a man who is willing to carry out a request in order to secure the rights to some property after the war. The request is for him to take Anton Barth, a paralyzed deaf-mute to some place of safety to protect him from the Nazis. Anton and his family are Jews. Wohlbrecht agrees and carries Anton to the top of a mountain and deposits him in a hidden cabin, along with a goodly supply of fruit preserves and tinned goods. Wohlbrecht takes himself off to a hospital for lunatics, where he insinuates himself onto the staff. A big part of his job is to help with the injections that the inmates get that kill them off. The Party doesn\u2019t want crazy people to survive. It seems as if the inmate population is heavily slanted towards Jews. He serves there up until the administration learns that the war is nearing a close and that Germany is about to lose. That\u2019s when Wohlbrecht remembers Anton. He believes that his saving that one Jew would be sufficient to get him excused from accusations of war crimes. Unfortunately, he told a couple other people about Anton, and those others came to the same conclusions. It\u2019s a race to the finish for each of them to get to Anton\u2019s bones \u2013 he is presumed dead \u2013 first, in order to save their own skin. Who wins? Better read this to find out. Of the short stories, two of them were fairly good. One, \u201cJourney Through the Night,\u201d tells the story of a man who enters a train compartment for his journey and finds that his companion is a cannibal who plans on dissecting him during the trip. \u201cThe Judgement,\u201d spins the tale of a mass murderer who is in jail awaiting his execution. He has managed to kill twelve people, but feels that he needs to hit the lucky number of thirteen before his death. He plans how to do that, but something else comes to put his plans awry.

Intricate, black, bestial. . . .\u201d \u2014Robert MazzoccoThe title story's actually more of a dark farce. The plot is appropriately cynical - after promising to continue to care for a jewish family's paralyzed son (in exchange for an apartment) as the mother and father are sent off to a concentration camp, the horrible protagonist of the story abandons the boy to a cabin in the woods. Once the war is over he and others (all Nazi collaborators in some way) realize the value of appearing to have hidden and cared for the boy (surely dead at this point) and make a mad dash to claim the body. I enjoyed the pitch black humor and the out of nowhere absurd magical elements - like when the poor abandoned paraplegic boy gets transformed into sort of green/wild-man of the forest by the magical headbutt of a stag. Admittedly, there are a few short stories left that I haven't gotten to, but the others I've read beyond the main title story are also pretty good. My favorite so far is a fantastic and scary short story about a man who's trapped on a train with a very matter-of-fact serial killer and faced with some tough choices. Still, the dark and cynical tone of the stories isn't really what I'm looking for right now, so back to the shelf go the remaining few for another time."}, {"userName": "Bob", "userReviewDate": "Feb 26, 2014", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/82944-bob", "userReview": "The son of Viennese Jews, Lind was moved to Holland in 1938 at the age of 11 and spent his war years both there and in Germany \"passing\" for a Gentile Dutchman.This somewhat arbitrary way of having been spared seems to have shaped his literary sensibility which is imbued with absurdism and black humor. Each story concerns someone in disguise (which mostly fools no one, as in the case of Jewish convert to Christianity, hidden in an Amsterdam hollow wall, expounding his new faith with Talmudic intensity and discursion), in hiding both literally and figuratively (a boy paralyzed since birth who is suddenly able to walk when abandoned in the woods at age 20 and by the end of the war has decided he is actually a deer), or, in two stories, confronting cannibalism in some odd form.Lind gets compared to Musil, Joseph Roth and other Viennese writers of the turn of the 20th century - the dialog of working class characters also reminds me of Alfred D\u00f6blin."}, {"userName": "Lucas", "userReviewDate": "Oct 02, 2009", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/1072850-lucas", "userReview": "A good collection, but it didn't quite live up to the promise of the title novella, which is one of the most bizarre and entertaining things I've read in recent memory.

He's got the ingredients here for an all-time favorite (Nazi mental hospitals, witches, horse cadavers hanging from the rafters and more), but most of the short stories seemed like they were symbolic of something that went right over my head.

In the title novella and six subsequent stories, Lind distorts and refashions reality to make the deepest horrors of the twentieth century his own.Set during World War II, \"Soul of Wood\" is the story of Wohlbrecht, a peg-legged veteran of World War I, who smuggles Anton Barth, a paralyzed Jewish boy, to a mountain hideout after the boy's parents have been sent to their deaths. Abandoning the helpless boy to the elements, Wohlbrecht returns to Vienna, where, having been committed to an insane asylum, he helps the chief psychiatrist to administer lethal injections to other patients. But Germany is collapsing and the war will soon be over. The one way, Wohlbrecht realizes, that he can evade retribution is by returning to the woods to redeem \"his\" hidden Jew.
