I think Griffith is a pretty brilliant writer so when I see a new book by her I will absolutely read it. This was a tough read. It was even harder to read than I expected it to be. It is an unfiltered look into what a horrible disease MS is. I have to admit I didn\u2019t know much about multiple sclerosis. It wasn\u2019t until about two years ago I read a book that had a main character with MS. Since then I have read two other books that had characters living with this disease. So Lucky was definitely the grittiest and hardest to read. One thing I learned from this book is it looks like the medicine side-affects are often worse than the actual MS. Plus add the fact that there is no cure, this is one awful disease. It is obvious that Griffith did her research for this. It almost feels more like an autobiography than fiction. I do have to say I was a little disappointed in the ending. This book is on the shorter side and I felt the ending was a little abrupt. I didn\u2019t expect this big happy ending, that would not have been realistic, but I hoped to see more how the character worked things out. Griffith is an excellent writer so you will always get a quality written book by her and this was no exception. It is very real and dark at times. This is actually my second very hard read in a row. I need something light and fluffy next. I\u2019m glad I read this and I recommend this to people wanting to know more about MS.An ARC was given to me by Netgalley, for a honest review."}, {"userName": "Jenny (Reading Envy)", "userReviewDate": "May 13, 2018", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/68030-jenny-reading-envy", "userReview": "This book reads so much like a memoir I had to keep reminding myself it isn't. The murder plots and shadow creatures are not real. But everything else probably is, and based on the author's experience. Mara is working as the Executive Director for an HIV non-profit, very successful, and has just parted ways with her wife of 14 years, when she has a fall. It is revealed to be Multiple Sclerosis. The writing is punchy and I found myself reading it cover to cover. I had always meant to go back and read Hild by the same author, a completely different genre from this one, so I was interested in this, not even knowing what it was. I didn't expect what I found, because I hadn't read anything about it. I think readers who have liked Lisa Genova's books on disease (Still Alice, Inside the O'Briens, Every Note Played, etc.) would devour this, but it has a different kind of intensity: it feels personal. It feels personal, because it is. The author posts openly on her blog about coming out as queer, and then having to come out with MS later on. The character she writes in So Lucky knows how to mobilize, how to build community, and how to advocate, and it feels like the world beyond this novel has more hope because of it. I supervise someone with MS, and I also want to say that this book helped me in my understanding of the daily life of this disease.The author has even created a Spotify playlist to accompany it, which I always love.Thanks to the publisher for providing me early access to this title through Edelweiss.

So Lucky isn\u2019t exactly a \u2018fun\u2019 book to read, (Mara goes through a lot including sudden bursts of paranoia and panic and intense self-hatred), but it was definitely an eye opening experience. there\u2019s something in the way Nicola Griffith narrates Mara\u2019s day to day life as a disabled young woman in such exquisite and sharp detail, that it becomes hard to put this book down, despite how aggressive Mara is as a character. she might come off that way, but she\u2019s also just as confident, strong, hard-working, and a total boss. the writing style blew me away!! it\u2019s hard to find out there, but there really is a way to balance just a tiny bit of purple prose with a fantastic main character as a narrator, and the end result is totally worth it. i\u2019ll definitely be checking out some of Nicola Griffith's other books after this!!!this book is really short and pretty matter-of-fact, so i don\u2019t really have much else to say about it other than it\u2019s a fantastic read. total rec if you\u2019re trying to push yourself out of a reading slump."}, {"userName": "Agirlcandream", "userReviewDate": "May 23, 2018", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/16738961-agirlcandream", "userReview": "A fictional novel clearly written by someone with an intimate knowledge of the vagaries of Multiple Sclerosis.

This book is no exception. It's short but breathless, propulsive, structured in short sections that convince you not to put it down. This was supposed to be a writing day, but I kept sneaking one more page, two more pages, ah, why not just keep going? Griffith has written a visceral, urgent, taut narrative of a woman attacking a new diagnosis, and the things (literal, figurative, metaphorical) that attack her, and her attempts to keep her humanity, her queerness, her body, her fitness, her friends, her dignity, and her self-identity in a system that is bent on erasing her.

It was mostly the main plot which caught my eye - 'Multiple Sclerosis'. Its a diseases of your immune system where your own cells attack your neurons leading to a myriad of symptoms. It can either be chronic or a remitting relapsing type, wherein the remitting one will appear randomly throughout your life, then go into remission and then the attack may hit you again. The chronic one is the more dangerous one which will lead to death soon after the diagnosis. (Pardon my enthusiasm, neurology is a favourite subject of mine)So anyways the lead in the story is diagnosed with Multiple sclerosis, which leads to the unraveling of her life. As is the case with most neurodegenerative disorders, there isn't a proper cure for MS. As my professor would say, 'We know so much about the nervous system and yet we know nothing'. The only way to manage your symptoms is to take immunosuppressants, and hope that you get better. Most of the drugs for neurological disorders are mostly on trial and also really expensive. We see firsthand how this affects Mara, as she struggles with treatment modules which suit her budget. I loved the way the author wasn't sugar coating anything. Everything was in your face, for instance, the part where Mara discusses about lack of awareness about multiple sclerosis which leads to lesser funding and thus lesser relief for patients.Its sad really, how a disease changes your life. Mara loses her job, is recently divorced and is thrown into a harsh life all alone with a dreadful disease. The hallucinations, the fear, the anger, the frustration and the disappointment about life in general is a commonly seen occurrence in people with neurological disorders. There is also a plot about hate against cripples and it was really well placed in the plot. Kudos to the author.There were also a few inquisitive things, like how there are theories about HIV positive people not being subjected to MS. As a student of science I love such questions and this book struck a chord with me. If you love real to life honest books, then you must read this. The author has put in a lot of effort and it's really appreciated, as such books are the ones building awareness about such conditions. The stigma attached to these diseases has to go and that can be only achieved by increasing awareness."}, {"userName": "Emily", "userReviewDate": "May 10, 2018", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/12065550-emily", "userReview": "\"I had no idea what lay in my future now.\" So Lucky is a unique story. I haven't read anything else in which the main character is dealing with a diagnosis of multiple sclerosis. This book is raw, and deals with many heavy emotions like uncertainty, rage, loneliness, etc. The main character feels what she feels, and doesn't let anyone else tell her what to do. I felt like her anger at her situation was realistic. Some elements of this book reminded me of The Sound of Broken Ribs by Edward Lorn - the main character has health issues, and there's an aspect to both that seems paranormal.

I think my reaction is partly due to the reality of MS to the fantastical - for instance the narrator progresses rapidly within weeks whereas that kind of progression takes years. I puzzled over the first drug choice, rebif really? Probably the last I would have chosen! Plus I never felt that invisibility, in fact people have proven themselves to be wonderful. And one other thing, everyone I know with ms and that\u2019s a lot of people due to forums and social media, is a warrior, smart and vibrant, not sad saps. But for someone who has never known a disabled person or one with a chronic illness this is a wonderful way to get in the mind of someone grappling with a diagnosis.

I felt so lucky to find it there because it had just been published and my library didn't have it yet.It is the powerful story of a successful happy woman whose life turned on her in one week. Her wife of many years asks for a divorce and she is presented with a diagnosis of Multiple Sclerosis. Mara, at the time, had thought she had been happily married for 14 years. She was a high level martial artist and the head of a multimillion-dollar AIDS foundation she had been instrumental in building. She was not a victim and then she was.Over the course of the book, Mara comes to grips with her condition and learns how to adapt her fighting spirit to the hand she has been dealt. It is both heartbreaking and inspiring, also something of a psychological thriller because Mara is fearless and gets herself into plenty of danger. Most of all it is the way Nicola Griffith writes about the gritty daily details that brought this reader to an awareness of what life is really like for a handicapped person in our society. I think it would also bring hope and empowerment to individuals who are disabled or chronically ill.I suppose the book falls into the category of what these days is called auto-fiction. The author was a self-defense instructor diagnosed with MS who has reinvented herself into a full-time award winning writer. She is the author of one of my favorite books ever, the amazing Hild. She has written seven novels and now holds a PhD in Humanities. She is an unrelenting champion of women.The bottom line is that she is a strong writer and creator of fierce female characters.

I found Hild to be much more cohesive, but this is a powerful story too, and well worth reading (even if, to me, not quite satisfying in terms of structure).So Lucky is a very short novel and a very quick read (I read it in a day and a half, and those were busy days, too). The protagonist, Mara, is an activist, employed by a large NGO, whose life is turned upside down when, within the space of a very short time, her more-than-a-decade-long relationship ends, she is diagnosed with MS and her interpersonal relationships are tested. The novel details the next few months in her life on several planes.The personal story told in this book is, just as the publisher promises, urgent, political and maybe even incandescent. I am not surprised that it is (partly) autobiographical, because the emotions feel real and true. Mara's anger and fear (and I think also the medical side of things, though I lack the expertise here) are conveyed perfectly, and constitute a real call to action. Mara is a complex and interesting protagonist, and I appreciated how she is called out by the narrative about her fear responses.All the same, I didn't find the plot to quite work for me. The realistic elements: the personal story, both relationship and medical issues-wise - yes, and I would have liked to read more of them. But there are two other stories here - the crime story and the magic realist level of the narrative - that either didn't have enough page time to develop or didn't quite connect with the rest, and that receive abrupt send-offs. I thought that, the way they were written, they detracted from the story rather than making it more complex; they were just less interesting (they felt to me like the author cared less about them, too) and this showed particularly in the way they are neatly solved by the end: while the disability stays, and Mara is still struggling with her fear and anger by the end, these two subplots serve their narrative purpose and disappear. I may be in the minority here - perhaps other readers will prefer the modicum of closure these stories offer - but I wish they'd been developed more, or cut altogether (or maybe cutting one would have given the other the necessary room to breathe). That said, this was a minor issue in an otherwise interesting, gripping and personal novel. When I got to the end I wished the novel was twice as long, and I don't often feel this way about books."}, {"userName": "Dianah", "userReviewDate": "Apr 26, 2018", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/3735214-dianah", "userReview": "This novel/auto-fiction didn't exactly pan out the way I'd hoped.

BUT this is fictional and a damn good story. It isn\u2019t a lecture or a memoir - it is a story with a shocking plot which will make you want to hug the main character one minute and slap her the next. Truly powerful writing. And useful if you want to set up a non profit in America...Mara\u2019s life changes dramatically in the space of one week, when her wife leaves her and she is diagnosed with MS. She stumbles along making mistakes and trying to figure things out while worrying about her medical insurance and the choice of treatments. Her best friend has taken a teaching position abroad and they FaceTime/Skype until the distance becomes emotional as well as physical. This is all beautifully drawn and poignantly portrayed but Mara is no victim. She takes control, she accepts the friendship of her neighbour (and his fresh produce), she sets up CAT as an action vehicle where the \u201cC\u201d stands for cripple. Mara is not afraid to name herself and face the truth... but maybe not all at once.This is funny, infuriating, shocking and well worth the read. It will make you think but it will also entertain you.

She also followed how Mara's relationships change as her MS progresses and, in what I thought was the most brilliant part, how she misreads some of the relationship cues around her.

All of us feel vulnerable at times in our lives, especially when adding two or three life-stress events together like divorce, job changes, and moving, but Mara also has the added discovery of her body's betrayal from RRMS. A former belted karate fighter, she now fears the dark and wonders how she will live alone. A kitten helps, but not even that is enough when a series of murders seem to be related to an MS non-profit list. Is she a target? There is so much anger that boils off the page.

If you've ever wondered what it's like to be a crip or have MS or just strive to be a strong and independent person, read this one. Griffith does a superlative job of describing the extreme nerve pain of MS, the difficulty of just moving from place to place without assistance, as well as the reflection of what it means to be independent. I think it would have benefited from being a bit longer; I would have patiently waited for the murders to be investigated.

But her life has turned inside out like a sock. She can't rely on family, her body is letting her down, and friends and colleagues are turning away\u2014they treat her like a victim. She needs to break that narrative: build her own community, learn new strengths, and fight. But what do you do when you find out that the story you\u2019ve been told, the story you\u2019ve told yourself, is not true? How can you fight if you can\u2019t trust your body? Who can you rely on if those around you don\u2019t have your best interests at heart, and the systems designed to help do more harm than good? Mara makes a decision, and acts, but her actions unleash monsters aimed squarely at the heart of her new community.This is fiction from the front lines, incandescent and urgent, a narrative juggernaut that rips through sentiment to expose the savagery of America\u2019s treatment of the disabled and chronically ill. But So Lucky also blazes with hope and a ferocious love of self, of the life that becomes possible when we stop believing lies.", "title": "So Lucky", "url": "http://www.goodreads.com/book/show/36332157-so-lucky", "average": 4.11, "cover": "https://images.gr-assets.com/books/1519271133l/36332157.jpg", "reviews": 41, "authors": [{"url": "https://www.goodreads.com/author/show/90780.Nicola_Griffith", "name": "Nicola Griffith"}], "type": ["Fiction", "Lgbt", "Glbt", "Disability"], "outlinks": ["http://www.goodreads.com/book/show/36332157-so-lucky", "http://www.goodreads.com/book/show/36582346-so-lucky", "http://www.goodreads.com/book/show/17332243-hild", "http://www.goodreads.com/book/show/180270.Ammonite", "http://www.goodreads.com/book/show/270259.Slow_River", "http://www.goodreads.com/book/show/180206.The_Blue_Place", "http://www.goodreads.com/book/show/156925.Stay"]}
