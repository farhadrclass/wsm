Not everything I have to say about The Madman's Daughter is bad, so thankfully this will not be a wholly negative review, but there were a number of things I didn't like and those elements combined with long periods of slow, plotless boredom made me feel this was no more than a two-star read. But let me offer you something good first because my initial impressions of this novel were entirely positive. Firstly, though this won't matter to many readers, I adore this cover. It's creepy, atmospheric and it caught my eye instantly. I actually prefer covers that are a bit different and edgy to the usual close-up of a girl pouting in a ballgown. Anyway, aesthetics aside, this book immediately introduces the reader to a strong, sassy protagonist who isn't afraid to kick ass or get her hands dirty. I felt sure that myself and Juliet Moreau were going to get along great - and we probably would have if I'd cared more for the story. I also thought the first couple of chapters set the scene well with a touch of the macabre to draw the reader in. So, I will happily admit that the first chapter or two elevated my hopes for this book a great deal.Then, I don't even know what happened... it was like for seventy pages things just came screeching to a tremendous halt. Basically, Juliet and Montgomery (possible beau number one) got on this boat and there were all these ships and sailing and sailors and...Then, of course, there was a romance and - even worse - a love triangle. I don't even hate love triangles that much, I just can't stand it when that becomes the main focus of the story. This book is described as a \"gothic thriller\" but the truth is that everything either gothic or thrilling came second to the romance which was filled with the same old cliches and annoying gushy phrases like \"I couldn't deny the way I floated inside when he touched me\". The two candidates for Juliet's heart - Montgomery and Edward - were presented as complete opposites: the gentlemen vs the wild man... ooh, haven't heard that one before!What astounded me most of all about this relationship was the way Juliet's mind jumped so quickly from one to the other and back again. One minute she was thinking about Montgomery's pretty eyes and the next she had moved onto Edward's sexy charms. This is one example from the book that had me snorting aloud in disbelief:\"Didn't Montgomery remember last night, during the storm, running his fingers down the bare skin of my back? I did. I could barely think about anything else.\"directly - as in, the actual next sentence - followed by:\"Edward sat across from me, deep in his own thoughts. His hands still bore the scratches from our escape. I wondered if his ribs still hurt him. I absently touched my own, remembering the feel of his hands holding me there behind the waterfall.\"Then we come to some more slow sections like the walking through the jungle scenes and the needlepoint explanations - I wanted monsters, not sewing...One thought that I had through most of this was that so many parts of the book seemed like pointless filler to stretch out a weak plot. My theory is that Shepherd may have stretched the story too thin in order to make it into a series instead of a standalone - or perhaps she's just a fan of slower-moving plots - either way, large chunks were too uneventful for me and I had a hard time making myself finish it. Though the stories are not alike, the way I feel about The Madman's Daughter is similar to how I felt about Grave Mercy, they both started great but quickly became bogged down by slowness and romance. To give one final bit of credit where it's due, I will say that there was a pretty nifty twist near the end that I didn't see coming, unfortunately it was all just too little too late."}, {"userName": "Kassidy", "userReviewDate": "Sep 30, 2013", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/8937622-kassidy", "userReview": "I loved this book! It is so twisted and crazy, and I really enjoyed how dark it is. It's been a while since a book has actually freaked me out a little and this one did that! It's just so weird and messed up, but I couldn't stop reading. I really love the writing and Juliet's voice. I felt sucked in by her story. There is a big love triangle, which I think turns people away from it. I personally enjoy love triangles and I think this one was done fairly well.The ending took my by surprise along with some other plot twists, and I can't wait to continue on in the series!"}, {"userName": "Sasha Alsberg", "userReviewDate": "Oct 22, 2014", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/10915830-sasha-alsberg", "userReview": "Wow! this book surprised me in the best way possible.

The Madman's Daughter is a spinoff story for The Island of Dr. Moreau by HG Wells. While you can read this book without reading the other, I encourage the reading of both. Especially to see where the inspiration for this book comes from. Some parts follow very closely the story of Wells' book and others quite different. In particular is Megan Shepherd's original character, Juliet.Juliet is the daughter the the infamous Dr. Moreau. She is 16 and orphaned on her own. Her father fled the country after information about his scientific experiments got out and her mother died several years later. From wealth to poverty and ridicule Juliet has not had the easiest life. Yet she is smart and educated. Quite knowledgeable in science, especially for a woman of that time. I must say I liked her inner strength and while she is may be unsure of her own \"unlady-like\" interests I simply find her ahead of her time.She runs into her childhood friend (and her father's assistant) Montgomery who informs her that her father is alive. Against his better judgement she insists on being taken to him. On their journey to the island they come across a man named Edward. And the three of them, along this Balthazar (Montgomery's assistant) go to the island. There things take a turn for the twisted. And anyone who has read The Island of Dr. Moreau know what I speak of. For those that have not, read it or this for more information. What I will say is that Dr Moreau is a very dedicated, and obsessed scientist. His experiments come above all else in his life. And that can come with unexpected prices for everyone.Dark, often psychologically twisted with some romance and madness thrown in this adventure. We get some borderline steamy scenes between Juliet and Edward and Juliet and Montgomery. Both men very different and both seem to have their own secrets. I could never trust either own of them and yet was drawn to learning more about them. Although my favorite character was Balthazar. Sweet Balthazar who is quite caring, protective and puts others above himself. While he is a minor character in the story he is a great one. And dear, innocent Alice, whom I wish I had gotten to know more in this book. Even Dr Moreau had qualities that draw you in. So I must say Megan Shepherd did an amazing job with each character.This story is very engaging, and well-written. Also thought provoking at times. Is Dr Moreau mad? The mystery behind each character keeps you guessing their intentions and what secrets they may possess. Who can Juliet trust? Each time you get a bit further, a new question to ask yourself arises. It makes for a very thrilling read. Overall, I highly recommend this book for older teens and adults. There is a bit of something for all readers although the love triangle romance does have the book geared more toward females. The is some action, adventure, creepy science and more to be discovered!"}, {"userName": "Khanh, first of her name, mother of bunnies", "userReviewDate": "May 09, 2013", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/4527753-khanh-first-of-her-name-mother-of-bunnies", "userReview": "Mostly creepy, very gory...and sometimes sexy and hot, which makes me feel very uncomfortable with myself. It is not the most exciting read; if you want fast-paced action, look elsewhere. This book is atmospheric and psychological above all else. Lest I inadvertently made it sound boring, it is not. There is plenty of adventure...the heroine finds herself travelling halfway around the world to a wild, mostly uncharted island, after all, but I feel that the ambience and overall tension in the book exceeds the action.Juliet is a strong heroine. Just 16, she has been living on her own, working as a cleaner in the King's College of Medical Research after her father's flight and her mother's subsequent death. It was not always like this; she was raised to a life of gentility. Her father, before his disgrace (the terms of which are slowly revealed throughout the first half of the book), was a highly respected surgeon in society, and her mother a society lady.When he is embroiled in a massive scandal, her father fled and is presumed dead, leaving Juliet's mother and herself to creditors. They barely make ends meet, living in a shameful manner before her mother dies, leaving Juliet on her own without any prospects besides the street and life in servitude. Juliet has always held onto the hope that her father is alive, and her belief is confirmed when she runs into her father's assistant, Montgomery. When she is kicked from her position due to self-defense against a rape attempt (remember: 19th century England servants don't have a whole lot of options other than to grin and bear it), she follows him to her father's island and is joined by a mysterious shipwreck survivor named Edward, and discovers the horrifying truth behind the rumors.Despite the setting, Juliet is no simpering, swooning Victorian miss. She may have been raised as a gentlewoman, but her father's profession and her subsequent fall from society means she has the backbone, the willpower, and a stomach steeled for survival. She is fiercely intelligent and knowledgeable of science, particularly the biological sciences and human anatomy. She has read Darwin and other burgeoning scientific works of the day and is a young woman who is well ahead of her time. \"Dead flesh and sharpened scalpels didn\u2019t bother me. I was my father\u2019s daughter, after all. My nightmares were made of darker things.\"Regardless of her circumstances and how far she has fallen, Juliet never feels sorry for herself: she is a survivor. I absolutely loved her as a complex, tenacious, but not invulnerable character. This is what all YA authors should aspire to when writing a strong yet not intolerably stubborn female protagonist who never subjects herself to martyrdom; she knows she is a victim of circumstances, but does not blame herself unnecessarily for anything for which she is not directly responsible. She is so utterly sympathetic.As familiar as she is with vivisections and procedures involving cadavers, Juliet is strongly against torture and does not hesitate to end suffering when she sees it. A note to the squeamish and to animal lovers...you will be very uncomfortable with some scenes in this book. When Juliet's acquaintances are vivisecting a living rabbit, despite her lowly status and being a woman who, god forbid, has no place in medical research, she does not hesitate to end its suffering: \"I took a deep breath, focusing on the rabbit\u2019s neck. In a movement I knew had to be fast and hard, I brought down the ax.\" I assure you, after reading this book, henceforth, you will cringe upon hearing the word \"vivisection.\"Despite her strength, Juliet has a low self-esteem. She sees herself as abnormal, given her knowledge and intellect; she knows that intelligence is considered a discredit when a man chooses a woman for marriage. She believes herself unlovable because of her fallen background, because of her bloodline and her nature.\"I was cold, strange, and monstrous to those boys, just like my father. No one could love a monster.\"Juliet knows the rumors that abound after her father absconded. Regardless, she loves him and tries to believe the rumors were just that. In her bleak fight for survival every day, all she has to cling onto are her memories, the good ones, of her father \"...the feel of his tweed jacket, the smell of tobacco in his hair when he kissed me good night. I couldn\u2019t bring myself to believe my father was the madman they said he was,\" although subconsciously, she knows what lurks behind the rumors. \"As I matured, more memories surfaced. Deeper ones, of a cold, sterile room and sounds in the night\u2014recollections that never entirely disappeared, no matter how far I pushed them into the recesses of my mind.\"Juliet isn't gullible, she knows what her father did, and she's scared of him. At the same time, her emotions are so torn in different directions because he is still her father. Dr. Henri Moreau may be a rumored madman to society, but he is also a genius and despite everything, Juliet still loves him. As she struggles to explain to Edward: \"I wasn\u2019t defending my father. I was defending the part of me that knew what my father did was evil but was terribly proud that he\u2019d accomplished it. My father's blood flowed in my veins, too. Didn\u2019t he understand that?\"I was angry at times towards Juliet for her passive acceptance of what her father did. Even when faced with danger on the island, she can't run away, but whatever disbelief I felt at her actions were greatly explained by the time. She is a helpless woman in 19th century England. There aren't a whole lot of choices; it was either to remain with an insane father and his menagerie or become a prostitute. I was also so furious at her for not being angry with her father, he left her and her mother, what did he think would happen? The fact that Dr. Moreau was so blas\u00e9 about his daughter's existence and sudden reappearance into his life was as monstrous to me as his insane experiments.\"You\u2019re young. You haven't experienced how unjust the world can be.\" He sighed. \"You're upset I didn't bring you with me. You've every right. I thought it was no life for a child, running, hiding out on an island a hundred miles from anything.\"Asshole. I wanted to strangle him at that point. Dragging a child onto a strange island is better than slaving her days away scrubbing and dodging the lecherous advances of her employers? Better than leaving her and his late wife penniless, when his wife had to become someone's mistress to keep a roof over their heads? She was a child. Dr. Moreau is an atrocious man in so many ways. Even so, I can't completely hate him.The villains in this book are so ridiculously well-written, so complex, that the reader as well as Juliet are conflicted to where their loyalties lie, and we are forced to ask ourselves where to draw the line between good and bad, reason and madness? If man is capable of creating something better, should he or shouldn't he? I had my mind made up, or so I thought, but the arguments are presented quite masterfully by Dr. Moreau that I found myself agreeing with him. His powers of persuasions are no joke, and he is a very-well written character. I couldn't find myself completely hating him; I couldn't decide whether he was mad, intentionally cruel, or just the pure definition of a scientist who will do anything for his art.\"Don\u2019t act so horrified, Juliet. It is merely surgery. You are no doubt familiar with some of the more common practices. Setting broken bones, amputations, stitching ruptured skin back together?...No one questions the hand of a doctor performing such procedures. No one calls it butchery\u2014it is science, and no different from what transpires behind the door of my own laboratory. For it is surgery I perform...I am in pursuit of the ideal living form. Just like all of us, wouldn\u2019t you say? The same reason we choose mates and procreate. We want to create something better than ourselves. Perfection.\"The island setting is mysterious, beautiful, and fraught with danger and mystery. It is a strange and wondrous place to Juliet, not only because of the environment that is so completely different from anything she has experienced in foggy, rainy, cold England. \"A blue sky stretched as far as the ocean, which we glimpsed between breaks in the trees. I\u2019d traded a bitter English winter for the lush tropical sun and beautiful calls of faraway birds.\" Every setting in this book is vividly described, from the eerie, dank setting of midwinter England and the clammy, filthy settings of the university hospital to the spectacularly verdant setting of the island and its odd inhabitants.Lest I go on and on about the perfection of this book, I did find one fault. I didn't like the romance; I found it rather forced, given the premise of the book, but I suppose it worked in the long run. The love triangle didn't work well for me, because I didn't like either of the characters. Edward and Montgomery were well-written enough, complex enough, but the way they were depicted didn't make either appeal to me romantically.I didn't like Montgomery's role as lackey. He was an utter doormat throughout much of the story, a mindless drone doing Dr. Moreau's bidding. Montgomery, I felt, lacked a backbone. He jumps when Dr. Moreau says so. Even Juliet, who has admired him all her life, observes this. She likes him, but she is not immune to his faults: \"Montgomery was slave to my father\u2019s will. Helping him with his terrible work, defending him...Montgomery wasn\u2019t cruel, I knew that to my core. Father might have dragged him here as a child, raised him to do terrible things, but Montgomery wasn\u2019t a monster. He shouldn\u2019t act as Father\u2019s puppet.\" Over and over again, we see Montgomery do terrible things at Dr. Moreau's bidding, and more than once, I similarly wanted to strangle him for being such a lily-livered sycophant.As for Edward...I just didn't trust him. His appearance was mysterious, and he just didn't feel right as a character. His self-explained past was too vague for me to trust him, and I had so many questions I wanted to ask him as I read that I'm amazed Juliet gave him so much leeway.There are moments of steaminess in the story, although there isn't much of it. It makes sense, given the context and setting of the story, and of Juliet's age. Although she is only 16, she is not sheltered, but in the era in which she lives, women aren't supposed to be sexual by any means. The romance, when it comes, is as shocking to her, and as uncomfortable for her as it is described to us. She is a growing young woman, with no mother to guide her, and in an era which shames sexuality, so it is understandable that the steamy moments, and her dreams are so strange and awkward...although rather steamy. There is a dream scenery involving blood, an operating table, and sawing that shouldn't be sexy, but was...kind of. Ahem. I think I said too much.The ending: wow. I didn't see that coming, but then again, I didn't read the original. I can't possibly see how the sequel could top this, but I will be eagerly anticipating it."}, {"userName": "Kiki", "userReviewDate": "Sep 25, 2016", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/4074594-kiki", "userReview": "Okay, so do you guys remember when I read Shadow and Bone and I thought the plot was kinda cool, I liked the side characters, I liked the heroine - I got on board with her weird morality and can-do attitude - but I fucking hated Mal? (I'm writing this on my phone and iOS 10 actually just autocorrected 'Mal' to 'anal' which is basically the gist of it.) Well guess what.Round two. Motherfucking Montgomery.This tool. THIS guy. I swear to fucking god. I actually loved Juliet, because she spoke to me and I related to her and she was proactive and she deeply valued her friendship with another woman who was very different than her, but all of it is overshadowed by her completely bewildering infatuation with Montgomery.He is the absolute worst character in this book. He was agonising to read about. A little piece of me died every time he was mentioned. And he's so unnecessary; this book is so incredibly original (and extremely well-written, paced beautifully and very deft in its retelling of the 'classic' it's based on) but Montgomery is the typical childhood friend turned bland lover that we've seen about 16,000 times before in YA. There is nothing convincing about his feelings about Juliet or about her love for him. And it sullied my feelings for Juliet, because she was smart and sharp and sometimes brutal, but she let herself fall in stupid love with this dumb asshole. Juliet, pull your fucking self together! Fuck.In some ways, this book belongs to Edward; he is far and away the most captivating character. I loved him. He was dark and weird and sad, and I related to him, as strange as that sounds. He got me right in the feels, guys. The revelation concerning Juliet's nature felt a little flat to me - like, I was surprised, sure, but it didn't feel as shocking as I think it was meant to. But Edward? By god, chaps! That one knocked me right off my chair! This book was a nice deviation from your typical Victorian fare: there's nothing stuffy or boring aboutit, and I fucking hate the Victorians because they're stuffy and boring. I can't stand them. But this book feels...fresh. It feels sprightly and inspired and innovative. I like that it's morally grey and that its heroine has the capacity to be an incredibly kind person but also very ruthless as well. Juliet really, really grabbed me, guys. (Except when she was hanging around that fucking cock Montgomery. What a stupid prick. I want to punch his fugly face.)I moan, I bitch, I complain. I kid, too. This was actually an incredibly enjoyable read. Dark and twisty and not afraid to be itself. I seriously admire the author for reinventing not only a less well-known 'classic' but also for making it completely her own and by taking thematic risks. This book is not afraid to be gory and weird, and it doesn't shy away from brutality, or from questioning substantial themes like morality and humanity and the blurred lines of family, particular the unfathomable complexity of a father-daughter relationship. It was a nice surprise for me. So yeah. It was nice.Except for fucking Montgomery. Fuck off, Montgomery."}, {"userName": "Wendy Darling", "userReviewDate": "Apr 13, 2012", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/2745288-wendy-darling", "userReview": "* Riveting beginning with fantastic scenes of horror * An uneven middle that I'd love to do all kinds of unholy surgery to, especially the over-emphasis on the uninteresting and rather tedious romance(s)* But saved by a great premise, awesomely freakish moments, solid writing, and a bang-up, untraditional ending.

The rumors of her father's past never left her, but they made her a stronger and smarter woman. With a genuine interest in science, she can indeed call herself her father's daughter. Everything was going normal until she once again meets Montgomery, her father's young assistant. Their crossing of paths changed her life for good.I am quite impressed with this book, especially because this is a YA book. I haven't read an amazing YA book in years, and I'm glad to say The Madman's Daughter might make me rethink my opinion of the YA genre. With the right amount of issues tackled and proficient writing, a YA book can be enjoyable.The characters were really likable. Juliet, Montgomery, Edward, etc were fun to read. It was interesting to know what was going to happen to them, and also their past. This being a historical fiction novel, the past is always a very important element. The author managed to tell a very interesting history.The main thing that made this novel amazing would be the mystery of her father. I just wanted to read on and on just to find out why, what, and how the father performed such experiments. With a huge interest in Science, this book was not a chore to read. It talked a lot about anatomy and physiology, topics which I studied last semester. The morphology of such creatures were somewhat on the fable side, but honestly curiosity made me interested still. I believe that in the field of science, almost anything is possible. To keep things short though, the topics tackled were more than adequate to keep my interest intact. 4.5/5 stars. One of those near perfect novels. One of the highest ratings I've given for a YA book. I'm really glad I finally decided to read this. While it was not genuine horror, it was still genuine great. Highly recommended from a reader who doesn't even like YA that much. It was that good. Can't wait to read the sequel!"}, {"userName": "Stacia (the 2010 club)", "userReviewDate": "Jun 22, 2012", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/4013351-stacia-the-2010-club", "userReview": "Warning : inappropriate koalas ahead.\n\nIt happened again. I waited too long to read a book that I knew I was going to like. Instead, I picked up too many books along the way that were nothing but a crap shoot. What I'd hoped for : Creepy. Gory. Spooky. Did it happen? : Check, check, and check.What I wasn't looking for : Overdone Romance.Did it happen? : Uh...twice. In a way I wasn't expecting.No, there were no actual threesomes. Sorry to disappoint.This book was a retelling of The Island of Dr. Moreau and a pretty decent one at that. At first, I was a little nervous that there wouldn't be enough new source material to make this stand out as its own story apart from the retelling, but thankfully, I was wrong. The second half of the story brought enough fresh material to an old tale to make me happy. The author did a great job of painting a picture about an island which was out in the middle of nowhere, completely inhabited by disturbing creature/human hybrids. When I am able to visualize the surroundings inside of my head, I feel like I'm right there in the story with the characters. As well, the sights were not the only thing to drag me along for the ride. I could practically hear the screams of the experiments as well. I had this entire mini-movie playing out for me, complete with dark lighting, ominous noises, and even imaginary scents lingering in the background. This is the kind of stuff that makes reading multi-dimensional.Now, I might have had an easier time picturing the island due to the fact that I've seen the recent movie of the original book a few times. But, I still think that I would have liked Daughter even if I didn't have a visual reference to refer to. Because, again, the author did a great job of sketching out the island and its inhabitants. She gave plenty of detail about the creatures, down to the shape of their facial features and body hair counts. Back to the romance. If nothing else, I was surprised by the turn that it took near the end. I went into the story expecting the author to favor one path, and a different path was taken. I do appreciate the break from the expected. Even though I personally thought that this story didn't need the romance at all, I didn't have a burning desire to want to see anyone get thrown off a cliff either, so it wasn't really a big deal. If I could have changed anything, I would have left out the love triangle and made the story about Juliet and only one of the men. The guy who I would have axed out could have stayed a character in the story without taking an interest in her and it would have been even better. I am a big romance fan, but not even I NEED to have romance drama in every single book that I read. Sometimes, the story outside of a person's love life is even more interesting than the trials of love, which was most definitely the case here. The strength of the story came from the original source material. Love should have been served up on the side, the way I found the flirtation in the movie to be - a nice little juicy extra, but not the focus. But that complaint is minimal. Outside of the unnecessary love triangle, I have no complaints. This was quite an enjoyable read. I'm hoping that the next two books will be just as fabulous."}, {"userName": "Giselle", "userReviewDate": "Dec 10, 2012", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/4800103-giselle", "userReview": "Well... The Madman's Daughter is clearly its own kind of disturbing! It's cruel and grisly--I kind of loved it! If you enjoy bizarre \"mad doctor\" stories, if you enjoy Gothic novels in general, then this book is for you!As a big fan of Gothic novels, I can tell you that they are much more than just a book. They stand out. Being able to write a good Gothic novel is an art in of itself. The biggest part of what makes them great is the rich atmosphere that they exude. If an author is able to create a story that sends shivers down your spine, thrusting you into every sinister nook and cranny of its setting, then that author will have my heart, and Megan did just that! It's the first thing I noticed when I started The Madman's Daughter, and it's what I loved the most about it. I could vividly picture this dark, eerie world filled with secrets that you just know are bound to both disturb and astound you. A mad scientist with crazy ideas and a whole island isolated from the rest of the world to create experiments\u2026 It's a good sign that you're going to get a lot of bat-shit craziness! You have been warned!The dark vibe in conjunction with a driven protagonist gives us the perfect combination for such a story. It would have been very unsatisfying had she been a damsel in distress; this story needed someone just like Juliet. Someone determined and intelligent. Someone who suspects that she, also, inherited a little madness from her father. Not batting an eye when you cut off the head of a (live) rabbit is a good sign of such a fact. But when she decides to go after the truth, she shows fearlessness and tenacity. Seeing her stand up to her father is exhilarating! I adored her character. I will admit I was not a huge fan of the romance, however. We do have a love triangle which I think was not especially necessary, but did amount to something at the end, at least. Neither boys were anything special to me, they never got into my heart as far as love interests. They were great characters though and I enjoyed the part they played in the story. Likewise, every side character in the book is wonderful and... unusual. They're either a scientific experiment or a little off in the head. Balthazar is my personal favorite. We meet him fairly early on and his disfigurement is only one part of his charm. What was the most disturbing for me, was how far my imagination would go when I started to think of these creatures. It's all kinds of messed up. I freaked myself out time after time! Get ready to meet some strange individuals!Going hand in hand with a great Gothic novel is the underlying mystery throughout the book. How far has the doctor gone? What is his big plan? What exactly are they so afraid of on the island? I was both amazed and terrified by this madness that surrounds not only the doctor, but the whole island and their inhabitants. I wasn't even disappointed when I caught on to the bigger twists before I was meant to. Although one of them is the kind of obvious that makes me think we were supposed to know. Regardless, the highly secretive and cryptic atmosphere is maintained all through to the end. With rich writing that propels you into this gloomy, unnerving island, separated from civilization without chance of escape, The Madman's Daughter is going to be a hit amongst those who love eerie Gothic thrillers with a side of grotesque!--An advance copy was provided by the publisher for review.For more of my reviews, visit my blog at Xpresso Reads"}, {"userName": "Whitley Birks", "userReviewDate": "Mar 29, 2013", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/5193512-whitley-birks", "userReview": "*zzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzz*sasdfj huh?

It certainly worked from a tone standpoint, though. I didn\u2019t always know what she was doing, but I always knew what she was feeling. Montgomery was a good character. I felt like he had a real potential to be a strong, complex character. Of course, the book kept harping on just a few points that were relevant to the love triangle, but he had all the building blocks of a man with a compelling story and dilemma. I even rather liked him and Juliet together. It was a romance that didn\u2019t bother me in the least. THE BADThe plot! Oh my god, the plot. What was the plot? Well, Juliet goes to this island where her disgraced father lives and does confusing magic that this book claims is somehow science. She finds out what he\u2019s doing, runs off in the jungle, gets lost for 200 fucking pages and then just goes right back anyway. She has a weak love triangle with the only two fuckable boys on the island. Then in the last few pages, everything catches on fire and she leaves. AND THAT\u2019S IT. Somehow that takes 420 pages. Juliet barely even does anything except repeatedly mope and get lost. She can\u2019t even be arsed to get herself off the island. That\u2019s just a combination of the boys doing stuff and stuff happening. I don\u2019t even know how I got through the whole thing, although it did take me much longer than I should have.The only thing worse than a love triangle is a love triangle where one corner doesn\u2019t have a chance. Juliet was in love with one boy the whole novel. The other one was just there to make her whine more and fill the requisite trope. And this \u2018romance\u2019 took up the majority of Juliet\u2019s thoughts, even while she\u2019s being chased through the jungle by some poorly-worded and un-described threat.Why was Edward even there? He\u2019s got a nice plot twist at the end, but it\u2019s so poorly alluded to. It\u2019s less a twist and more of a \u201cHAHA, SOMETHING COMPLETELY NEW!\u201d The author worked so hard to make sure that you never saw it coming that Edward\u2019s entire raison d'etre got lost in the mix. For most of the novel, he was just there. Wasting space.THE UGLYDr. Moreau\u2019s evilness was so overblown that I actually started to side with him. It\u2019s sad, because he was doing some pretty creepy shit. The descriptions when Juliet found out about it was even properly horrifying. And then she spend something like six pages droning on and on and on and on and on and on and on about how evil and \u2018mad\u2019 her father is. And that\u2019s not even including the rest of the novel, where she continues to whine inscently about his madness. It got to the point where there was so much wining and angst that I was willing to slap Juliet and tell her it wasn\u2019t that bad, just as a knee-jerk reaction. Dr. Moreau\u2019s experiments were not given enough space to let the reader come to their own conclusions about them, and that took a lot of horror away from what should have been a very horrifying concept.The science! Oh good god the science. Imagine for a moment that you\u2019ve broken your leg. Some mad doctor comes along and sets it sideways. Makes and L-shaped cast and sets your leg at a right angle to where it should be. The bone heals in that configuration, and you\u2019re stuck with a sideways leg. Now imagine that the same doctor comes and gives you pills, saying that if you don\u2019t take those pills, your leg will straighten out again, even after it\u2019s already completely healed in the new way. That\u2019s the level of science comprehension we\u2019re getting in this book. Absolutely none of it make the least god damn bit of sense. I don\u2019t need my evil horror stories to make a whole lot of sense, but I\u2019d rather they skip the explanation instead of give me one like this. The attempts to explain the science were so bad that they were actively distracting me from the book. The theme of madness was handled very poorly. I know what the book wanted to do. It wanted to have a feel of \u2018the island is twisting everyone into madness.\u2019 All of the characters were described as mad at some point. NONE OF THEM ACTED MAD. (Except for the doctor, of course.) They all acted perfectly within normal behavior ranges, and Juliet just randomly declared that some things were evil and other things weren\u2019t. It completely gutted the intention of the story, and in the end, the only thing that actually felt crazy was Juliet\u2019s wild leaps in logic. I was particularly upset with what Juliet described as her own \u2018madness\u2019 because, as one of her examples of proof, she includes DEFENDING HERSELF FROM A WOULD-BE RAPIST. Book, author, everyone, DON\u2019T EVER INCLUDE SELF DEFENSE AS A SIGN OF THE CRAZIES.And, of course, the islanders. After Juliet learns the truth about them, there\u2019s a huge hullabaloo over whether she thinks they\u2019re human or not. She decides, in a fit of angst, that they act so very human and loveable and she can\u2019t think of them as monsters. Until a paragraph later, where she calls them beats and animals. And the book hops over this line again and again. They\u2019re monsters. Oh, but killing them is murder. But they\u2019re beasts! But this one over here is cute, so let\u2019s call him human. Back and forth and back and forth. It would have been fine if this was intentional, if it was made a point of Juliet\u2019s character, where she struggles to decide what her viewpoint on them is. But no. It\u2019s just there. She\u2019s apparently fine with insisting that they\u2019re people and then describing them as beasts.Just\u2026ugh, the whole book was a mix of rolling my eyes and falling asleep."}, {"userName": "Sophia Sardothien", "userReviewDate": "Aug 15, 2014", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/28997068-sophia-sardothien", "userReview": "Official Rating: 4.8 Stars. This book is incredibly enjoyable, it is inspired by H.G Wells' The Island of Dr. Moreau (which I have yet to read) However I still enjoyed reading this book a lot regardless :D The story is extremely unique and different, I'm so glad I picked this up. The plot was amazing though the beginning was a tiny bit slow, however towards the middle there were a lot plot twist. I won't say the plot twits were extremely shocking but it is indeed unpredictable. The other thing I really like in this book was the characters, the protagonist in particular I felt like she is an incredibly mature and stable protagonist. However there was one thing in this book that took away the 0.2 stars was the romance, though I won't say the romance was forced or I hated the love triangle but there were something about it I just did not enjoy.

Others may call it a skill, but trust me, when you have it, it's a problem) where, if I go into something knowing that there's a huge twist in the end, I will introspect every little detail that I normally would have overlooked had I not known there was a twist, leading to me pinning down the twist long before it is revealed, which also leads to my enjoyment in the mystery being lowered significantly. The huge twist in the movie Identity, which seemingly everybody was blind-sighted by? Guessed it in the first two minutes of the movie. Pretty much every single adult murder mystery, which inevitably ends in a twist ending? Pssh, easy; the baby's the rapist. The Madman's Daughter, however, is quite the enigma. I'd gone into The Madman's Daughter knowing that there'd be a twist ending (and for those who have the same problem I have, I'm sorry, but you were bound to find out there's a twist eventually), and while I, in the end, got most of the twist pinned down, how I got to that twist was different than I get to most others. The case with most twist endings is that I come up with at most two theories, and at least one of them slightly resembles the twist at the end. But in the case of The Madman's Daughter, I went through multiple theories as to what the twist was, what the monster was, and the solution to most of the novel's mysteries. And then, when I discarded one theory and thought I'd never see it again, I only ended up bringing it back into play mere percentages later.And even though I did see the major twist coming (mind you, however, only about ten percentages before it was revealed, which is pretty damn impressive for the book), the fact that I saw the twist coming didn't impact my enjoyment in the novel in the slightest, unlike most cases. Sheperd incorporated each and every twist into The Madman's Daughter with such finesse and cleverness that each twist was enchanting, and I was able to look over the fact that I had saw them coming and just turn the pages in awe as I had come to realization of how Sherperd had woven the twists into the story. And speaking of the story, what a story it was! The Madman's Daughter opens with a bang, and ends with an even bigger bang, full of complete and utter brilliance at every corner. The middle, however, is where I feel the novel met its faults. While much of the middle section of The Madman's Daughter is filled with suspense, intrigue, and secrets, much of it is also filled with relationship angst, something I am definitely not a fan of. And while I wasn't completely sold on either of the romances in The Madman's Daughter, which is probably why reading about Juliet go on about either of the boys was a bore to me, I definitely appreciate and almost admire how Sherperd made the love triangle play out. Juliet was an absolutely amazing character, and I found myself loving her very soon in the novel. She's smart, sassy, strong, and while she is a bit sidetracked by the boys at times, I found her to be an amazing heroine and protagonist to follow around, and her sparkling wit and how she dealt with the misogyny of her father was amazing. The character of Juliet's father, Doctor Henri Moreau, was also one that was well developed, and he was a character I found myself loving to hate. The two love interests of Juliet, however, like I had mentioned earlier, never really sparked much of a reaction from me, and my opinion on both of them are pretty lukewarm, but they, too, are met with a good deal of character development throughout the novel. Chocked full of suspense, interesting and clever plot twists, creepy-crawlies, great side-characters, and truly disturbing and horrifying moments, The Madman's Daughter will surely appeal to any horror fans looking for a chilling read. I'm not entirely sure where the story could go from the ending of The Madman's Daughter forward, but either way, I thoroughly look forward to reading the next book in this trilogy and seeing what else Megan Sheperd has in store."}, {"userName": "Maja (The Nocturnal Library)", "userReviewDate": "Nov 06, 2012", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/4551536-maja-the-nocturnal-library", "userReview": "3.5 starsEvery girl wants to believe the best of her father, doesn\u2019t she? I barely remember mine, but no one could convince me he was anything other than perfect. Sixteen-year-old Juliet Moreau, once a proper young lady and now no more than a servant, is desperate to learn the truth of her father, the man who abandoned her and her mother and left them to starve. When her father\u2019s former servant and now assistant Montgomery shows up in London, Juliet talks him into taking her to her father, on a remote island full of monsters and peril. While on their way, they rescue a castaway, a young and dangerously attractive gentleman, and he ends up joining them on the island. Juliet is torn between the two men, but more than that, she struggles with her feelings towards her father. Is Dr. Moreau the monster everyone believes him to be? Or is he just a misunderstood scientist, like many brilliant minds before him?Having read The Island of Dr. Moreau ages ago, I had a pretty clear idea of what to expect from this book, but I didn\u2019t know how far Megan Shepherd would take it, and let me tell you, she took it pretty far. The Madman\u2019s Daughter has more than its fair share of grotesque creatures, doctor Moreau\u2019s almost-people with scales, antlers and everything in between. Some are more intelligent, some barely a step above their true form, but all of them are deformed in one way or another. What the good doctor lacks in compassion, he makes up for in sheer brilliance \u2013 no sane person would want to go anywhere near his crazy factory, but one can\u2019t deny that the results are pure genius.\nA painful bellow tore through the night. I kicked the sheets off, swear pouring down my neck. Was it the sheepdog? I didn\u2019t know any creature that could make such an ungodly sound. As the screams dragged on, haunting my every breath, my mind started to wander to darker and darker places. Wondering what could cause an animal to scream like that.\nJuliet father, apparently clueless to the situation he\u2019d left her in, expected her to be the lady she was raised to be while he was still a London doctor and a respected member of the society. This I found to be the utterly unbelievable, more unbelievable than the creatures he was creating. That he would not know, I can believe. That he wouldn\u2019t want to know, I\u2019d even expect. But that Juliet wouldn\u2019t lash out and tell him instead of subjecting herself over and over again to his condescending sermons, I simply refuse to accept. Here is the culprit, the man who abandoned her, left her to the mercy of others, essentially forced her mother to prostitute herself and then killed her, all to chase wild experiments and create abominations on a god forsaken island. Above all, I don\u2019t see how or why Montgomery wouldn\u2019t explain to him the condition in which he found Juliet when he arrived to London. It makes no sense to me. \nWhatever it was \u2013 his new discovery \u2013 it had consumed him enough to abandon everything else in his life. It was more important than his reputation, his wife, even his daughter.\nWhich brings me to Montgomery and his weird case of Stockholm syndrome. He was Dr. Moreau\u2019s servant and the only one the doctor didn\u2019t abandon, but as nice as that sounds, he\u2019s the one who got the short end of the stick. Forced to help Moreau with his crazy experiments, he grew up surrounded by monsters, with not a human in sight. Since he'd never known anything but the life had with the crazy scientist, his almost blind obedience to Dr. Moreau was certainly understandable, but it made him a very lousy love interest. For the life of me I couldn\u2019t understand why Juliet would be attracted to him. Yes, at first there were the childhood memories, that link of two children who suffered through a trauma together, but as the story progressed and Montgomery continued being the doctor\u2019s punching bag, a servant in all but name, that initial draw should have faded, leaving nothing but a clear image of a man with no backbone behind. However, Juliet continued to find excuses and endless justifications for Montgomery, and although they were mostly true, they should have invoked pity, and not passion.Edward the castaway was a different story altogether. Juliet was equal parts uneasy around him and attracted to him. Yes, he was intriguing, but she sensed something was not quite right with him. And yet, unlike Montgomery, he was a proper gentleman, and therefore fitting for Juliet, which got him a full support from her father.The big plot twist towards the end wasn\u2019t completely unexpected, but I still liked the way it was handled. It increased my overall enjoyment (and my rating) and made me more excited about the second book, despite the fairly disappointing ending. Megan Shepherd has a talent for writing horror, which makes me especially glad that we\u2019ll see two more books in this series. I just wish she\u2019d stay away from tropes altogether, and far, far away from love triangles."}, {"userName": "Lotte", "userReviewDate": "Dec 15, 2014", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/25309949-lotte", "userReview": "Wow, I did not see that ending coming.

I was my father's daughter, after all. My nightmares were made of darker things.'I feel the need to start off by saying I didn't dislike this book but obviously considering my rating I have some explaining to do. There was creepiness, there was a decent story line, but the pacing was so incredibly slow that it had an adverse effect on my overall opinion on this gothic retelling.Let me tell you guys, the beginning of this story had so much creepy going on it was amazing. I remember starting this book, finishing the first couple of chapters, stopping for a second and saying to myself, \"This is going to be so awesome.\" Juliet seemed to be a very promising main character and I couldn't wait to hear her story. But the gothic thriller aspect seemed to be put on the back burner and definitely became less of a focus. What did it end up focusing on? Romance, of course.There was so much emphasis put on the romance and her being torn between two men, her swooning and constant need to fan herself that I would go so far as to consider this 'historical-romance-lite'. If not for the creepy and exceptionally gruesome bits in this story I don't believe I would have finished this. As it was though, the romance didn't feel fitting in this type of story, like an irregular puzzle piece.I had been forewarned that the middle dawdled but that the ending was a big shocker so that gave me hope. The pacing was definitely off for the vast majority of the middle portion and didn't actually start picking up until almost the very end of the book. The big reveal happened and it was definitely the most interesting aspect of the entire story but it happened a little too late for me. There wasn't a slow build-up to the grand finale which would have made this immensely better. Instead we received a storyline that plodded along, lacking in intensity, never quite gaining enough steam, and then we're hit with the big ending. The middle section certainly required something more for me to still be invested enough in the story to be excited for when the big conclusion finally did happen. Oh, and there's a cliffhanger. Naturally. I think my response to that final page was something along the lines of, \"Dude. For real?\" Considering I was more than a bit bored through the majority of this story I was at least hoping we'd get some answers. I had still considered giving #2 a shot since sometimes it takes the first book to build the story (in a series) and book 2 is where we can finally get to the meat of the story. But my understanding was that this was a retelling of the Island of Dr. Moreau, however, the summary for book 2 states it was written: with inspiration from Robert Louis Stevenson's 'THE STRANGE CASE OF DR JEKYLL AND MR HYDE' and I'm not sure I feel about the mixing of multiple retellings."}, {"userName": "Amelia, the pragmatic idealist", "userReviewDate": "May 05, 2012", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/1852293-amelia-the-pragmatic-idealist", "userReview": "would be a perfect idea if not for the blasted love triangle."}, {"userName": "Sarah", "userReviewDate": "Oct 07, 2013", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/7591340-sarah", "userReview": "\u201cThe world knew my father as a villain.

This book cannot be described as fun, weaved heavily with mystery and horrific writing, this book should be more described as like the title suggests madness. Pure madness.Ever since her mother died and her father, a once loved scientist was also pronounced to be dead, Juliet's life has been nothing but eventful. As a maid, with no one to turn to, she tries not to think about the one thing that made her life turn upside down. Yet when one small clue of her father being still alive appears in front of her, she immediately takes up the chance--instead of finding her father, she is once again face to face with Montgomery, her father's assistant from when he was still in London. Soon enough, she discovers that her father is actually alive, hidden on a remote island far away from London. And with Montgomery by her side, they set sea on their journey. The more time she spends on the island, the more truths she discovers and the more she realises that she should have never come.Juliet Moreau, daughter of the madman scientist was the main character. She started off as a solid, capable character who wasn't the slightest bit lady-like. Yet as the story deepened, she began to lose her strong charisma and became marginally irritating and boring. This wasn't a huge issue but I couldn't help but feel my impressions towards Juliet slip lower and lower as the story grew to the end. However this is not to say that she didn't lose her spunk and skepsism, even towards her father. I loved her cautiousness and her thoughtful actions, while not too slow but not too impulsive--also, her layers of depth and secrets about her past are nothing less than compelling and fascinating.What really nullified my enjoyment of The Madman's Daughter was the romance. We have a muted angst going on with the addition of a love triangle (yeah... laaaame.) There is Montgomery, the gentleman that Juliet has known for most of her life and the castaway, Edward who was saved by Juliet and Montgomery when they were sailing along on the ship to the island where Juliet\u2019s father had taken asylum to hide--which mind you, held a distinct, creepy atmosphere. Anywho, I was incredibly astonished to come across such a clich\u00e9 romance in a promising, thriller-ly novel. Sure, a romance can be here, but it doesn't have to be so overpowered and stereotyped. It makes no sense, if Juliet has finally become independent, after dropping her position as a maid, it doesn't mean she needs to have two guys all insanely into her. For a novel I could have given 5 stars, it was lowered due to this main factor.Due to the ineffective romance plot, life on the island isn't quite as consistently eventful. There are details that I wished could have been used effort elsewhere, instead of some monotonous jungle walks. The plot came in a little too late--there isn't much of a distinct one, more like an ongoing background mystery--and by the time the plot had more focus, the book ended. Also on a cliff-hanger (!!) but luckily I'm starting the sequel sometime very soon. Another small niggle was the fact that this was a historian set novel. I actually felt that this genre label was wasted in this book. There are only a few pieces of dialogue that actually felt like it was said in the historical era, so it bugged me to remind myself that this was set in the more ancient times. It was seriously off-putting to read a piece of dialogue and have 'hitherto' inserted randomly--it did not go with any other elements.The Madman's Daughter was disappointing in the romance and plot-- therefore meaning the book became a little monotonous at times but I still appreciated Megan Shepherd's idea, writing and main character.

I couldn't, for the life of me, figure out why she's more focused on the two boys when there were so many other things going on right in front of her. The book's blurb states that it's a \"breathless gothic\", and it was for the most part of what I've managed to read, but damn. It's the romance that I could've gone without. I mentioned this on one of my reading statuses that instead of her focusing on the fact that her father didn't care enough to send for her when she was as poor as a church mice and on the verge of prostituting herself, she was more concerned about her confusing feelings toward Edward and Montgomery. I hated that she'd become that girl when she could've been a stronger, smarter woman. And I know I'm missing out. I've not even gone deep into the story of the island. I didn't get to find out who Edward was or where he really came from. And I wanted to know why the humans there are deformed. But I just couldn't get over this huge wall of a stupid love triangle. I just couldn't give a fcuk. I hated reading Juliet's incessant thoughts about how the two boys set her on fire. Right then. I think I should go read the original work."}, {"userName": "Bark", "userReviewDate": "Sep 30, 2014", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/2905339-bark", "userReview": "This is a young adult novel with a love triangle. You have been warned.\n\u201cEdward and Montgomery were suddenly both by my side, each taking an arm.My face burned as I looked between them. Two boys, two sets of hands on my wrists. One rough and calloused, the other strong yet smooth. My emotions knotted tighter, threatening to cut off my circulation.\u201dI picked it up knowing this and expecting the above because I was seduced by the plot. The \u201cmadman\u201d is actually Dr. Moreau. Yes, that Dr. Moreau. The one who, in my dreams, creates these lovelies:Dr. Moreau was basically run out of town and his reputation ruined after his nefarious experiments came to light. He abandoned both his wife and young daughter and high-tailed it to an island. Flash-forward a few years and Juliette is now a teenager eeking out a living as a maid. She stumbles across some evidence to the location of her long-lost father and, though she is haunted by memories of him, he is the only family she has left and she sets off an adventure to track him down. She may wish she had never found that first clue before it\u2019s all said and done . . .I really enjoyed most of this book. It has a very well done sense of place and maintained its creepy gothic \u201cwhat the heck is going on\u201d atmosphere throughout. The love triangle was unnecessary and I didn\u2019t give a rats patootie about it but I\u2019m too old to care about teen crushes and flip flopping between handsome boys. I wanted more gruesome surgery scenes but what is here was enough to make me happy. \u201cTo me, blood smelled like home.\u201dI liked Juliette. She fears she is too much like her father; cold, a little blood-thirsty, perhaps, maybe even a little mad. She is very honest in her thoughts and I found this realistic as well as refreshing. She was the only character who really captured my attention. There are many twists and turns and secrets to be revealed and I was surprised more than once at a few of the reveals but if I\u2019m being honest it was way too long. Probably 80 or so pages too long. The backdrop, the horror (quite repulsive at times) and the evocative writing elevates this above most of what\u2019s out there and the ending was perfect. If this interests you check it out. I don\u2019t think you\u2019ll be disappointed."}, {"userName": "Louisa", "userReviewDate": "Nov 25, 2012", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/10378346-louisa", "userReview": "The love triangle ruined what could've been a perfectly horrific Gothic YA.Plus, the name Edward's been kind of ruined."}, {"userName": "Christina (A Reader of Fictions)", "userReviewDate": "Apr 13, 2012", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/2602702-christina-a-reader-of-fictions", "userReview": "My review style is, and always will be, to write up my review right after I complete the book, and I do mean right after. If I can't write the review, I will save the last chapter until I have time. Doing otherwise would allow me to slack off, and I would never get anything reviewed, as well as giving me time to forget the book. The downside of this reviewing method, one I just have to accept, is that occasionally I have to try to compose a meaningful, coherent review while shell-shocked by what I've just read. Bear with me, as The Madman's Daughter definitely left me feeling a bit dazed.On a lot of levels, I'm really not entirely sure just how I felt about this novel. One thing that I do know quite for sure is that Shepherd writes well. Her syntax and diction dovetail with the historical setting, and never once threw me out of the book. Though much of the novel consists more of suspense than outright action, Shepherd kept the story tense and me on the edge of my couch.Littered throughout The Madman's Daughter are literary references. Of course, the novel itself retells H.G. Wells' The Island of Dr. Moreau, which I have not read. However, my perusal of the Wikipedia article convinces me that Shepherd reworked the story with a deft hand. In addition to this, she sprinkled in numerous references to Shakespeare, including The Tempest, a very apt work to be brought up in this instance. There is even a reference to X-Men, though not, obviously, so overt of one, since it didn't exist back then.What I found myself utterly unprepared for was how utterly dark, gruesome, creepy and horrifying this book is. Had I read Wells' work, I would have been better informed of the coming experience, but I knew nothing. Yes, the cover hints at creepiness, but this turned out to be one of the scariest books I have ever read. Of course, suspense has always been my weak point, as well as some other issues that I'll tackle next. Shepherd hits most of the staple varieties of horror: not knowing who to trust, fearing darkness with in oneself, mad science, gore, suspense, chases and more. Were I a big reader of horror, I do not know that I would have marked this as a must-read, but, let me tell you guys, you want this.However, I know a lot of people, myself included, have a big issue with animal death in novels. For me, kill a human and I'm rarely bothered; kill a furry, adorable creature and I will ugly cry. An animal dies in an awful way in chapter two, and over the last half of the novel focuses on just vicious, awful things done to animals in the name of science. Again, were I familiar with Dr. Moreau, I would have known, but... If you're seriously concerned, my recommendation would be to read Wells' novel or a summary of it online, because I suspect Shepherd's is darker than the original, based on my sole Wells experience.Juliet Moreau has a lot of sass and she made a delightful main character. I rooted for her along the way, which only made the horror that much more terrifying. Juliet's father, the infamous Dr. Moreau died, and, eventually, her mother did as well, leaving her to the charity of family. Unfortunately, her extended family turns out not to be at all charitable. Pulling on an old connection of her father's, she manages to obtain work at King's College as a maid, sunk low in prospects and station. At the college, Juliet is sexually harassed in the first chapter. I worried about whether she would have enough spunk to be an interesting main character, but, believe me, this girl holds her own once she is not trying to keep her job anymore.Shepherd also excelled at Dr. Moreau, who fits the mad scientist role to a T. Not really a spoiler because obviously: he's actually alive. He also very much comes across as a man of the time period. So many historical novels depict most of the characters as rather modern with regards to women's rights, particularly those appealing to female readers. Dr. Moreau has no such conceptions, believing women are to be married to the men their fathers say, and that they should do nothing but needlework and piano playing until that time comes. Juliet, feisty and clever, struggles against how he wishes her to behave.Sadly, I was not so fond of her love interests, Montgomery and Edward. Yup, a love triangle strikes again, though not one of the most annoying ones. I will credit Shepherd with not making it insanely obvious which man would be her choice, and with making both of them very obviously flawed, though neither one ranked as swoon-worthy for me. The love triangle reminded me somewhat of that in Griffin's Masque of the Red Death, though I felt a bit more sure in The Madman's Daughter which guy would win in the end. However, the ending did surprise me, so bonus points for that.Do not let the lovely cover fool you: The Madman's Daughter is horror through and through. Though not for the faint of heart, Shepherd has constructed a well-written and clever retelling, sure to delight fans of creepy tales."}, {"userName": "Kat (Kindred Dreamheart)", "userReviewDate": "Dec 24, 2012", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/6167480-kat-kindred-dreamheart", "userReview": "\"To me blood smelled like home...\"I have a love/hate relationship with anything goth-emo-horror. I love to read it, but hate to be scared or creeped out. Terrify me and I resent you. But do nothing and I shall call you \"bunny\". See you can't win.I remember The Island of Dr. Moreau movie when I was little. My older brothers were obsessed with it and kept it on repeat in the VCR. While I was usually around when it was playing, I can only remember snippets from covering my eyes. When I heard this was inspired by that, I knew the meat of the story but the potatoes were still foggy. So reading about the relationships of the characters in this novel was new and unmarred. Yet I doubted there was much that could get to me at my age.So with much doubt, I embarked on reading this novel (at my own risk). It gave me waking nightmares! I can't get the twitching rabbit out of my head.....GAH! Even when I said bunny earlier I thought of the one in the book and it made my flesh crawl. Ewww. And yet I read this front to back with my morbid curiosity driving me. I couldn't stop turning the pages no matter how gross or eerie things got. The ending was more a relief... I felt as if I had escaped the island of Dr. Moneau. Nonetheless, this was an exciting journey.The dynamics of the characters was complex. There was no definite evil person or saint. At times Juliet was as fragile as a lamb and others where she was as fired up as a wildcat. Dr. Moreau was no cookie cutter villain either. There was much to each character then first observations.There were enough elements sure to captivate the adoration of every reader:\u2665 romance\u2665 suspense\u2665 action\u2665 mystery\u2665 religion cults\u2665 murder\u2665 monstersThis was also way more mature than your average YA book. You will find yourself forgetting that the character is only sixteen.This was definitely retro with an edge of creepy! The cover fooled me. It looks like one of those historical fictions with language that will put you to sleep long before the story line catches. But rest assured, the gore picks up right away. The narrator's solemn situation and peculiar circumstances keeps you turning. There romance was only dished in hints, then it was right back to crazyville. Insane & magnificent in it's freakiness!Even in my dreams I can't escape the mental imagery of this novel which is why I have no choice but to rate it \"EPIC\"! GOTHIC THRILLER, INDEED!I could wax poetic on the many things I loved about this but I'll leave the rest for you to discover on your own.I look forward to future novels this author has to offer. *I received an ARC from the publisher for review and honest feedback."}, {"userName": "Jessie  (Ageless Pages Reviews)", "userReviewDate": "Dec 23, 2012", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/4863162-jessie-ageless-pages-reviews", "userReview": "This book and I got on about as well as this:  Why?

The last few chapters were a thrill ride. I wouldn't have guessed the plot twists in a million years.I have my reasons for the somewhat low rating (more on that later) but for now, I just wanted to say this: The Madman's Daughter is a very strong debut in the horror genre.---Full Review---An intriguing start and an amazing end, marred by a somewhat listless middle part \u2013 that is how I sum up The Madman\u2019s Daughter.The book starts off on a very promising note. We are introduced to Juliet Moreau, an orphan from a once-prestigious London family that fell victim to a horrible scandal. She ekes out a living working as a maid in a med school. I found Juliet a very fascinating character \u2013 sensible, resolute, toughened by circumstance, with occasional hints of something inexplicably dark shining through. It was gripping and sinister, exactly how I expect a horror novel to be.And then, it just fizzled out.I have two theories for why that happened.1. The Love Triangle.I\u2019m not a fan of triangles in general, but I don\u2019t mind one if it\u2019s necessary to the plot and done well (like in The Hunger Games). Except the triangle here is neither. Even on the island, where there are such deliciously creepy things to focus on, Shepherd spends a lot of time building Juliet\u2019s love dilemma. And it\u2019s frustrating. One minute, Juliet\u2019s worrying about the strangeness of the island, and then suddenly, she\u2019s wondering how so-and-so\u2019s hands would feel on her skin or how so-and-so\u2019s lips would feel on her pulsing veins. Meh.2. The Blurb.Maybe this doesn\u2019t apply to people who have already read The Island of Dr. Moreau, but I felt the blurb gave away too much information. Like what Dr. Moreau was actually doing/creating on the island. It\u2019s difficult to remain interested when you already know crucial things that the protagonist is yet to figure out.Somewhere around Chapter 30 though, things got good. And I mean, really, really good. The pace shot up drastically, the suspense was excruciating, and the revelations made me shudder. The Madman\u2019s Daughter assumed all the eeriness of a cult horror classic.Megan Shepherd is a fine writer. Her prose captured the sinister atmosphere of the island really well. I noticed something interesting about her use of similes though:\n Fear spread throughout my body like an infection.My head throbbed as if my skullcap was fitted too tight.Something about it lodged a dull pain in my side, as if a fractured rib now pierced my right lung.A chill tiptoed up my spine, one vertebra at a time.His lips grazed my neck, and my larynx tensed, ready to scream.\nSee what she did there?? Quirky. I like that ;)Overall, The Madman\u2019s Daughter was quite an enjoyable read that could have been better had the focus remained on the horror elements of the story and not the romance.A well-earned 3.5 stars.P.s. Fellow animal-lovers beware. Parts of this book can make you extremely queasy."}, {"userName": "Jessica-\u2765Chatterbooks Book Blog\u2765", "userReviewDate": "Oct 14, 2015", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/37057510-jessica--chatterbooks-book-blog", "userReview": "Dark, strange, mysterious, intriguing, and twisted are all words that I would use to describe this book. It was the perfect October read! I absolutely love the atmosphere of this book. The setting added so much to the feeling of the overall story. I don't think if it was set in present day and another place that it would have the same effect. The book had an ominous feeling throughout and you could just feel that things weren't going to end well. There were no happy endings in this story. The characters were very interesting. There was Juliet's father, Dr. Moreau, a deranged, cold, and completely unhinged man of science; Montgomery, the Moreau family's ex-servant, Juliet's best childhood friend and love interest, as well as Dr. Moreau's assistant in all things; Edward, a handsome castaway with a mysterious past and strong affection for Juliet; and the creepy deformed islanders with different levels of intelligence and morals. I enjoyed reading this story through the main character, Juliet's perspective. I loved that she acknowledged the little bit of darkness inside of her, the part that reminded her that she was indeed her fathers daughter. Despite that, Juliet was not a bad person by any means. She was inquisitive, smart, and compassionate. She was not however, a dainty, innocent, young girl. She was determined, brave, and she stood up for herself even when others may have ran or given in. Juliet had seen and experienced enough in her life to know the darker side of man. She was very wishy washy when it came to her love interests, but I wasnt bothered by that too much. The plot was well paced and kept me interested for the duration of the story. I did not see the twist at the end coming which was refreshing because I usually do. The ending made me want to immediately go out and buy the next book.
