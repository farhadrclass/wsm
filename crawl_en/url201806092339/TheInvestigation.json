Soon he finds himself in the Japanese army, a mandatory service which leads to him being assigned as a guard in the notorious Japanese prison Fukuoka. There he will find himself put in charge of the investigation into the death of a cruel and sadistic guard, Sugiyama.Things in this prison are not what they appear on the surface, there is much going on which Yuichi discovers as he continues to investigate. The Korean prisoners were treated horribly, considered to be nothing but work animals. One of the prisoners was a young poet, Yun Dong-Su and this young man would be the catalyst of many changes.Although there is a mystery at heart, this is 1944 and there is much history included. Can a man be more than what he appears, does literature and poetry have the power to evoke changes in person? Dong-Su is a real poet, and factually he was sent to this prison. He would become one of Korea's most revered poets. Much of his poetry is included in this story and it is beautiful. Even within the darkness of the prison beauty could still exist.\"So books were still alive, having laid down roots in someone's heart.

It is a beautiful epic story of freedom and humanity, about survival in war and not everything is as it seems, as the saying goes \u2018rivers run deep\u2019. The novel is inspired by the life and death of the Korean poet Yun Dong-ju and uses some of his posthumously published work, and a wonderful body of poetry that is used throughout the book. This really teaches you not to judge a book by its cover because on the outside we may look like swans but deep down we are paddling like crazy. The novel is set in Fukuoka Prison. Japan 1944 and outside the prison walls the world is at war which will eventually affect those within the prison walls. Watanabe is a teenage Japanese conscript prison guard with a love of literature has been placed on ward 3 which is full of Korean \u201ccriminals\u201d and the bully of a guard Sugiyama who has a penchant for being brutal with the prisoners. It is when Sugiyama is found dead he is tasked with finding who killed him and to take over his censorship duties.His original picture of Sugiyama is of a brutal prison guard and former war hero who enjoyed his role within the prison system. It is when he interviews various prisoners that he starts to build a different picture of the guard. When he interviews Yun Dong-ju he builds a friendship and respect for this Korean poet and it is through his interviews that a new view of Sugiyama emerges.Also at this time the Japanese start to use the Korean prisoners as guinea pigs and Yun Dong-ju is selected to take part. Watanabe is willing and urging Dong-ju to survive until the end of war but see him weaken by the day. Watanabe is also shocked at what is happening in the prison even more so when the warden receives a letter from Manchuria towards the end of the war. Watanabe finally receives all his answers and they are not necessarily the ones he wanted.This is a beautiful and captivating story that engrosses you from page one all the way through to the last page. A book about hope in the darkest times with a lament for lost freedom and humanity while war rages around and death is just something that happens. This book also teaches us that no matter how hard people want to kill literature it will live on in our minds and hearts however hard people try.This is a stunningly beautiful book that is worth every minute of reading and is a shame to finish. The prose is beautiful especially when remembering this was originally in Korean, Jung-Myung Lee has written a brilliant novel."}, {"userName": " Olivermagnus  ", "userReviewDate": "Mar 18, 2017", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/9919989-olivermagnus", "userReview": "The Investigation is set in a prison camp in Fukuoka, Japan, near the end of World War II. It focuses on the life and death of Korean poet, Yun Dong-ju. During the time I was reading the book, I was unaware the he was an actual person and did, in fact, die while being held in a Japanese prison camp. When a vicious prison guard known as Sugiyama the Butcher is killed found hanging with a stake through his heart and his mouth sewed shut, Yuichi Watanabe, a young Japanese guard, is put in charge of the investigation. He is also given Sugiyama's censoring duties, which is where he discovers his first clue and discovers that no one is quite who they appear to be. The Investigation starts as a crime procedural but quickly changes to something very different. The author describes the horrific realities of prison and the way the Japanese felt about systematically destroying the Koreans. Much of the book is filled with poetry and passages from famous classics like Les Miserables and even the Bible. Watanabe Yuichi falls in love with a nurse who works at the prison and she brings incredible insight into the story, revealing what she knows of both Sugiyama and Yun Dong-ju.This novel is part thriller, part historical fiction, and part literary fiction. Because the book is translated and filled with many unfamiliar names and places, many readers may struggle with the concept. The poetry and prose are especially beautiful and once the reader gets into the cadence of the storytelling, they will enjoy this clever and unique novel."}, {"userName": "Rebecca Foster", "userReviewDate": "Apr 18, 2014", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/5875398-rebecca-foster", "userReview": "(3.5) \u201cIf you have to bet on something, I suggest you choose hope.\u201d In the frigid January of 1945, narrator Watanabe Yuichi, a 19-year-old Japanese student soldier at Fukuoka Prison, is tasked with investigating the gruesome murder of his fellow guard, Sugiyama Dozan. Although Fukuoka is in Manchuria, an area of northeast China under Japanese control, most of the inmates are Korean, including real-life poet Yun Dong-ju, many of whose poems are included in the text.When Yuichi takes over Sugiyama\u2019s role as prison censor, he discovers just how influential music and literature can be in bringing life and hope into desperate circumstances. Yuichi is confused by the accounts he receives of his predecessor\u2019s character: Sugiyama was known as a brutal overseer who tortured prisoners for no good reason, yet he was at the same time a piano tuner and poetry lover, and also facilitated a secret prison library. \u201c[Sugiyama] was afraid of what he\u2019d become, a person who could be transformed by a book...moved by beauty, he realized he was still human.\u201dThe mystery element itself, ostensibly the most important thing about the book and what lends it its title, is not particularly compelling. A few passages seem overwritten, with metaphorical links made too overtly \u2013 such as the Hebrews\u2019 experience in exile being used as a parallel story for the Koreans under Japanese rule. Also, I was not always sure about the translation; there are some cheesy similes that are almost certainly better in the original, as well as some repetition of verbs.In general, I wondered if Sugiyama\u2019s tale could have been told in the third person; the framing device of Yuichi\u2019s narrative can feel unnecessary, except in that his family owned a secondhand bookshop \u2013 which introduces an alternative setting and emphasizes the nostalgic and sustaining powers of literature. In some ways this novel reminds me of the Holocaust story The Pianist (or the analogous life of Alice Herz-Sommer). Like many war stories, it shares in the same ultimate message: \u201cTrue emotion transcends language...Beauty without suffering is meaningless.\u201d"}, {"userName": "Bill", "userReviewDate": "Jan 25, 2016", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/1811095-bill", "userReview": "My library has this book filed under the mystery section. While there is a murder in the book, I have chosen to put it on my historical fiction shelf, as a large part of the book is to do with the real life poet Yun Dong-ju.The entire book is set in a Japanese prison in 1944. At the very beginning of the book, one of the guards, Sugiyama, is found brutally murdered. And for reasons unbeknownst to him, a very young guard, Watanabe Yuichi, is ordered to investigate the crime.While looking into this murder, Watanabe discovers over time that nothing is really as simple as it seems. As well as being a guard, Sugiyama was also the censor for the prison, dealing with incoming and outgoing mail, as well as confiscating books etc. The further Watanabe looks into the life of Sugiyama, the more complex a person he turns out to be. And while his murder is a crucial part of the story, poetry and music also have large parts to play. So even in the most brutal of prisons, music and literature somehow find a way to be heard.As I said, Yun Dong-ju was a real poet and many of his poems are included in the book, blending right in with the story. And what happens to him is probably the most important part of the book.So, if you're looking for a traditional crime novel, this probably isn't going to do it for you. But if you like historical or literary fiction, told with beautiful prose throughout, you might want to give this book a try. I hope they translate more of the author's works."}, {"userName": "Liz Barnsley", "userReviewDate": "Jan 06, 2014", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/16471876-liz-barnsley", "userReview": "Thank you kindly to the publisher for the Advance Reading Copy.Fukuoka Prison, 1944. Beyond the prison walls the war rages; inside a man is found brutally murdered. Watanabe, a young guard with a passion for reading, is tasked with finding the killer. The victim, Sugiyama \u2013 also a guard \u2013 was feared and despised throughout the prison and investiWgations have barely begun when a powerful inmate confesses. But Watanabe is unconvinced; and as he interrogates both the suspect and Yun Dong-ju, a talented Korean poet, he begins to realise that the fearsome guard was not all he appeared to be . . .First of all I should make clear that I adored this one with a fiery passion. Not since \u201cThe Humans\u201d by Matt Haig has a book touched me on a level such as this one. Absolutely addictive reading, with some beautiful prose I was fully immersed from start to finish. There is poetry within the pages \u2013 both literally and metaphorically \u2013 and the tale itself is a compelling one.The book is inspired by the life and death of Korean poet Yun Dong-ju and uses some of his posthumously published work, Poetry and the beauty of words is a theme throughout..and it works so well, having an effect on heart and soul that I can\u2019t really put into words. Add to that a snapshot of prison life during war, some absolutely amazing characters and a tendency to surprise you when you least expect it and you have a reading experience that is difficult to categorise.I really hope that people don\u2019t read the synopsis and think this is just a crime novel, or a war story. Whilst in a very small way it could be described as both of those things, there is after all a crime and it IS set during a war, the heart of this novel is so far removed from those two things, it kind of sits outside them peering in. I have also seen it described as \u201cLiterary\u201d \u2013 well yes but again, to me and to quite a few readers I know, \u201cLiterary\u201d often transcribes into bloated and endlessly dull \u2013 in fact Vicky Newham and I were having this very discussion last night. This book is anything BUT dry, it is never dull and is fascinating, heart stopping and purely graceful throughout.This is a story about how words have power. Power to change us, power to give us hope and joy even under the direst of circumstances. How inner beauty does not always shine \u2013 as Watanabe investigates the death of Sugiyama he discovers a man he never knew existed. It puts him firmly in the path of another man who will change his life. And running through the strands of the story are always the words \u2013 the poetry \u2013 and the heart of humanity. There is certainly more than one mystery going on here.This is the first book from a Korean author that I have read. Kudos to the translater, this is perfect in almost every way. I believe Jung-Myung Lee will be visiting the UK later this year and I hope, I really do, that I get to see him when he does and perhaps hear him speak. It feels like one of those things that must be done.I hope that I have inspired you to read this even if you would normally not consider such a book. Novels like this do not come along that often \u2013 for me anyway. I loved every minute of it. It brought me to tears in a cathartic way \u2013 And if I had to describe it in one word, one magical word, that word would be exquisite.Happy Reading Folks!"}, {"userName": "Jessica Woodbury", "userReviewDate": "Jun 14, 2015", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/4271946-jessica-woodbury", "userReview": "At first I thought this was a Japanese novel, but it's actually Korean. It's set in a Japanese prison with several Korean inmates, a piece of history I hadn't known about. At first this book seems like a crime novel, but it's actually about poetry and empathy.

I remember thinking that at the time I bought it, it didn't really seem like a crime novel, and I thought the reference on the best-of list was kind of weird, so I plowed through the translated fiction shelves, found it, and decided I needed to read it. The more I read into it, the less it appealed to me as a crime novel and more as a novel of historical fiction. This proves to me that it's highly likely that whoever it was that had it down on his/her idea of the best of crime list probably had no clue what he/she was reading (which is scary when I think about it) -- while there is definitely a crime involved here, it is not at all the central focus of this story. So if you're planning on reading it thinking that it's your next crime-fiction read, don't even go there. I will say right up front that I really liked this book. Some things detracted from my reading, such as too much in the way of repetition (yes, we know that one of the main characters loved and was highly influenced by Rilke but we don't need to constantly be reminded), and some seriously-obvious contrivances (especially in terms of the crime that frames the story) that prevented me from oozing love over the book. And I know this will sound sort of weird, but here and there while reading I kept saying to myself \"this is way too obvious,\" but then again, that's a me thing. I will also say that once I got used to all of the distractions, I found a really, really good story here. The novel begins at the end of World War II, as the narrator, Yuichi Watanabe, tells us. At the age of twenty, he is \"behind bars\" at Fukuoka Prison, having exchanged his \"brown guard uniform\" for \"red prisoner's garb\" since the Americans (who have occupied Japan, of course), have \"classified\" him as \"a low-level war criminal,\" charging him with abusing prisoners. He doesn't deny that he's guilty; au contraire, he knows that yes, he has \"yelled at them and beaten them,\" but he also realizes that part of his guilt was in as he says, \"doing nothing.\" He \"didn't prevent the unnecessary deaths of innocent people,\" he \"was silent in the face of the insanity, \" and he'd \"closed\" his \"ears to the screams of the innocent.\" Before the actual story begins, though, Watanabe clues in his readers to the fact that what he's about to say isn't solely about him, but rather\"about the war's destruction of the human race. This story is about both the people who lacked humanity and the purest of men. And it's about a bright star that crossed our dark universe 10,000 years ago...My story is about two people who met at Fukuoka Prison.\"And thus begins the novel in full, comprising Watanabe's story, which begins with the horrific murder of a prison guard who was also in charge of censorship duties. Watanabe is tasked with the investigation into Sugiyama's death, but this young man, whose mother repaired and sold books and who developed a deep and abiding love of literature while growing up, is also tasked with Sugiyama's censorship duties, which to him are abhorrent. It is an interesting setup, really, because while the investigation of the crime acts as a frame getting us into the workings of the prison, underneath all of that is the story of the last days of a Korean \"resistance\" poet named Yun Dong-Ju, (1917-1945) who was arrested supposedly for political activities, but in my opinion ( at least via this book), his only major crime was being Korean. It is also a story about the power of literature to transform even the hardest of souls, about the enduring legacy of literature, about freedom, about different forms of both resistance and oppression, and about the plight of the Koreans under Japanese colonial rule. As Watanabe tells us regarding Yun (but really, speaking for all Koreans), \"he was no longer free, but he hadn't ever known how it felt to be free; no Korean was free.\" One of the very best things I discovered about this entire book is the author's focus on language. On page 164, Sugiyama notes the following:\"So language wasn't simply a tool to convey meaning. It was the charter of a human being that contained a nation's history...\" As just one example, Koreans were not allowed to use their own names; instead they were required to take Japanese names and in the prison, at least, were punished if they tried to use their real ones. They were also not allowed to write in their native language. Some wonderful scenes occur in the novel around this terrible and oppressive law, but there are many, many others as well that combine language and the concept of resistance to produce some incredible moments here.Aside from my grievances about the detractors I listed (which obviously are personal to me and may not bother anyone else), I was actually very impressed with this novel, and it really is one of those books that's stuck with me. I read it over the course of two long plane rides and a two-hour layover (I had my nose stuck in it even while eating self-forbidden Tex-Mex in Dallas) and couldn't put it down. It's one I can definitely recommend -- it is a lovely yet horrific portrait of a bygone era, one that is not forgotten and which still resonates I would think, among Koreans."}, {"userName": "Libros Prestados", "userReviewDate": "Mar 18, 2015", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/36773851-libros-prestados", "userReview": "Este libro me ha sorprendido.

It\u2019s set in Fukuoka Prison in Japan during WW2. A guard has been found dead, hanging from a beam. His name is Sugiyama Dozan and he was feared and despised by all the prisoners for his cruelty and brutality. A young teenage conscript guard called Watanabe Yuichi is charged with investigating the murder. As he digs deeper into the circumstances surrounding it he discovers a whole world of conspiracies and deceptions that turn his world upside down. All his certainties about war and justice and punishment are subverted by what he finds. This is quite an amazing and haunting book. Whilst war rages outside, in this closed world of the prison another battle is raging, one that insists on humanity and compassion in the worst of conditions. Literature can be powerful enough to change lives. A vivid and raw picture of a Japanese prison and the unbelievably cruel treatment meted out to the despised Korean prisoners, this is a coruscating attack on human depravity, with some truly horrifying descriptions, but with a conviction that art can indeed change the world if given a chance.A powerful novel, one that I very much enjoyed, excellently and seamlessly translated and one that defies being put into a category.

Anti-Japanese Korean rebels, who made up a good portion of the ward where the murder occurred, had been his favorite victims.But Watanabe, who grew up devouring books in his mother's shop, soon discovers another side to the violent Sugiyama. According to Yun Dong-ju, a Korean poet, Sugiyama was a complex person, a fellow poet, a lover of music and a man crippled by guilt who sought solace by aiding the prisoners in his own way. Yun and the prime suspects question why they would want to harm a man they feared and respected.As he delves into the crime he is confused by what he learns about Sugiyama and beguiled by Yun's poetry (which is artistically used as a bridge between narratives) and the man's buoyant outlook on life despite the harsh conditions of his own.Gradually, through twists and turns that keep the reader turning pages, Watanabe finds himself replacing Sugiyama as protector of the Koreans and is as stunned as we are when he learns the truth about how and why the veteran was murdered.There actually was a Yun Dong-ju who died at Fukuoka Prison in 1945 and whose poetry is revered throughout Korea. Lee has done an excellent job of evoking the character and the trials of the prisoners and their guards in this first work of his to be translated and published in the U.S.This novel is so much more than an ordinary mystery and is highly recommended."}, {"userName": "Madhulika Liddle", "userReviewDate": "Apr 07, 2016", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/16294266-madhulika-liddle", "userReview": "Lee Jung-Myung\u2019s The Investigation starts out in almost classic historical detective story style. There\u2019s a brief prologue in which the narrator\u2014a twenty-year old Japanese soldier named Watanabe Yuichi, now a POW\u2014is introduced. The year is 1945, and something is weighing on Watanabe\u2019s mind. What that is, is the story of The Investigation, and it\u2019s set in 1944, in Fukuoka Prison. Home to hundreds of Japanese and Korean prisoners, both criminals as well as political prisoners (especially, among the latter, Koreans), Fukuoka sees deaths every other day. Until one day, when there\u2019s a very odd and unexpected death indeed: the brutal guard Sugiyama \u2018The Butcher\u2019, is found hanging, stabbed in the torso and with his mouth precisely and firmly sewn shut. Sugiyama\u2019s cell-mate, the very young Watanabe, is assigned to investigate Sugiyama\u2019s death, because\u2014as the warden says\u2014calling in the Special Higher Police will draw unwelcome attention to the prison. As a nervous and unsure Watanabe goes about trying to unravel the secret behind a man who seems to have been a prime candidate for being murdered, he finds things not quite what they seem. There is, for example, the infirmary nurse (and accomplished pianist) Midori, who flies into a rage at the very mention of Sugiyama\u2019s brutality. There is the Korean prisoner Choi, wild and seemingly intent on escaping, no matter what. And there is the young Korean Yun Dong-Ju, whose poetry enthralls Watanabe\u2026I began reading this book under the impression that it was a historical detective story. It is, to some extent. But the murder of Sugiyama, and Watanabe\u2019s discovery of the truth behind it, occupies no more than a couple of chapters in the beginning and at the end of the book, with a couple of passing references in between. The rest of it is a blend of many interconnected thoughts, truths, dreams, ideals, secrets and more. It is about the inhumanity of war, the way war and anger turn a man into a brute. It is about people who continue to find hope\u2014in a kite soaring into the sky, in books recycled to keep literature alive, in doomed prisoners, heading for their deaths, being allowed to listen to a choir rehearsing \nVa pensiero\n. It is about clinging to life, and letting go. This is a book not so much about an investigation, but about the beauty of poetry, the importance of books and love\u2014even so all-encompassing a love as that of a man for a girl whom he\u2019s never seen, but whom he only knows because her kite battles his. It is about inhumanity, but it is also about humanity: about two men, separated by years, by nationality, by social status, even by levels of literacy\u2014by almost everything, one would imagine\u2014but who end up truly understanding each other. For me, this turned out to be an unexpected and memorable book: lyrical in its beauty, stark and tragic and brutal at times, but also uplifting and inspirational. And it introduced me to someone I had never heard of: the Korean poet Yun Dong-Ju, of whom this book is somewhat of a biography. His poetry is quoted extensively, and his character so wonderfully etched, I\u2019d rate this one of the most poignant biographies I\u2019ve come across."}, {"userName": "John McKenna", "userReviewDate": "Dec 01, 2014", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/7390748-john-mckenna", "userReview": "Mysterious Book Report No. 173by John Dwaine McKennaMention \u201cWorld War II Prison Stories\u201d in any group and the resulting discussion will invariably focus around one of three classic and much admired movies: Stalag 17, The Great Escape, and The Bridge on the River Kwai.

Fukuoka is a maximum security facility housing hardened criminals mixed together with political prisoners, who are mostly \u2018filthy Koreans who spread sedition and lies about the Emperor and the Japanese Empire\u2019 according to Watanabe Yuichi, the narrator and book loving young guard who is assigned the impossible task of investigating the murder of Sugiyama Dozan. He was the most brutal, feared and merciless guard in the entire prison . . . despised by all, guards and inmates alike. Soon after Watanbe begins his investigation, a hard-core prisoner confesses to the murder, but after interviewing him and finding a hand-written poem in Sugiyama\u2019s pocket, Watanabe thinks that the confession is a lie and continues digging into the mystery. What he finds is that many hidden events are taking place within and without the violent penitentiary walls, including a man who\u2019s determined to let nothing stop him from digging his way out, a governor whose greed is limitless, a young girl with a kite trying to make friends wherever she can, a terrible, vicious guard who isn\u2019t what he appears to be, and Yun Dong-Ju, a Korean poet whose \u201cworks hold such beauty they can break your heart.\u201dThe Investigation is a complex, beautiful and enlightening work that will illuminate an obscure, but brilliant poet, while showing the reader that beauty and genius are indefatigable and found in the unlikeliest of places.

You have all the basic ingredients: war, poetry, love of books, characters that change and become more \"human\" as the plot advances... It seems an interesting combination.Sadly, Lee Jung-Myung makes more than one and two mistakes along the way.The story is not complicated. In a prison, a guard is killed. Another guard, a young guy that used to pass his time in his parents' bookstore, is asked to find the culprit. Cue cheesy conversations and references to authors almost no one knows. Yeah, you will know the names, but you probably won't have read them.I am the first to defend the authors desire to promote the classics. In his work \"Hyperion\", Dan Simmons brings with skill Keats into the novel and you may find yourself desiring to read Keats, even if his work has little or nothing to do on the surface with Simmons great novel. He's not the only one. But Lee Jung-Myung falls for florid and cheesy conversations and makes characters talk as people would never talk in real life. It may be a problem of the English translation, as the Spanish translation has been made from it and not from the original, but it may also have to do with the author's style.So one of the problems of the novel is that it descends into cheesy quite easily. But some people may love that. What they may hate in real life (someone talking to you bringing Rilke or Jammes into the conversation would probably sound like a snob in the ears of many people), they like in a book or a movie.But that's not the only problem. I am quite harsh, probably, but the actions of the characters are not justified enough, and I didn't believe the change that happens in some of the characters hearts. The way characters behave, or the way their changes are explained, are pedestrian to say the least. Specially with one of the main characters, Sugiyama.This could have been a powerful novel. Based very loosely on the last months of the life of one of Korea's most famous poets, Yun Dong-ju (\uc724\ub3d9\uc8fc), it should be bathing in poetry. Instead, it gloats on cheese.And, really, how many characters can you have smiling mysteriously in a novel?3"}, {"userName": "La Stamberga dei Lettori", "userReviewDate": "Oct 04, 2016", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/5361973-la-stamberga-dei-lettori", "userReview": "Bestseller in patria, La guardia, il poeta e l'investigatore di Jung-myung Lee \u00e8 arrivato anche in Italia all'inizio del 2016 per i tipi Sellerio.

The Investigation by Jung-Myung Lee, newly translated from the Korean and published at the end of the month, is one of those rare novels. This story was inspired by one of Korea's most well loved poets Yun Dong-ju, who is known only thanks to the posthumously published collections of his work. Portions of Yun's poetry is reproduced throughout the novel alongside work by Rilke, Stendhal and Dostoyevski, his work does not suffer by this comparison. The poems included are sensitive and lyrical even in translation they encapsulate a true sense of beauty and wonder at the world.  This sensitivity is mirrored in the novel itself, despite the harsh and horrific setting of Fukuoka Prison throughout the mid 1940's. The story focuses on the investigation carried out by prison guard Watanabe Yuichi into the nightmarish murder of a fellow guard Sugiyama Dozan. At the outset Watanabe knows little about his murdered colleague, having only been transferred to the camp a short while before the incident. What he does know is that Sugiyama was a feared man inside the camp. 'He didn't need to yell; he knew how to strike fear in someone with his soft voice.'Everything points to Sugiyama being a monster, even his appearance is scarred and terrible; he carries himself with an arrogance which comes of his war hero status. There are rumours about his ruthless actions on the battlefield, and he is known to be equally as ruthless when it comes to his pursuit of duty at the prison. 'He was vicious and crafty. The prisoners feared him and the guards avoided him.'One of Sugiyama's principle duties is that of censor. As a man who has only recently gained literacy, it is believed that he is best placed to recognise the intentions behind the phrases chosen by the prisoners forced to use a second language (Japanese) in all correspondence. The theory is that it is his vigilance in this role coupled with his brutal and feared reputation that is the motive behind his murder.Watanabe quickly finds that all the evidence does seem to point towards one particular Korean prisoner, a man who seems to have been especially victimised by Sagiyama, and one who appears to be keen to confess to the crime. With the crime solved, and his superiors content Watanabe is promoted and given the responsibilities left by Sagiyama's death. As censor he is able to avoid much of the violence and brutality of the prison camp; and as an educated man he finds himself drawn to the collections of confiscated writings that now fall under his care. His new duties, however provide him with unsettling new glimpses into the true nature of Sagiyama's character and motivations, as well as giving him access to one prisoner, Hiranuma Tochu (or Yun Dong-ju to give him his correct Korean name) who he finds increasingly fascinating.  As Watanabe draws closer to Yun he starts to see the beautiful spirit that has been left unbroken by years in captivity. Yun continues to have hope that all he need do is survive, that freedom will come and bring it's own release. 'We all have to survive so that we can see the end of this war. Remember, surviving is winning. A corpse cannot cheer.'Yun is aware that war, deprivation and suffering change human souls, but he has faith that if hope can be kept alive through the love of stories, and the beauty of the arts then the soul is capable of recovery.  'If these times make us evil, fine, let's become evil. But let's keep a human heart.'It becomes clear to Watanabe that the relationship between Sagiyama and Yun went far beyond that of prisoner and guard. In his investigation into how this unlikely connection was formed and maintained he discovers secrets and conspiracy that threaten his faith in the cause of Empire, and create deep and terrible feelings of guilt about his own inaction in a time of crisis. Eventually he resolves that the least he can do is survive, just as Yun would have wanted, in order to provide testimony of the truth, and the existence of a great soul like that contained within Yun Dong-ju.The novel is deeply moving; the power of art to provide hope, give comfort and increase strength in troubling times is the central compelling message. One that will hit a mark in the hearts of everyone who reads this exceptional piece of literature. I have seen this book compared to The Shadow of The Wind, but in my opinion it is even more powerful. In it's own way it is another in the significant influx of novels that have reading/books/bookshops/libraries etc at their heart. It was recently suggested to me, when discussing this influx, that nowadays the only people who actually buy and read books are the die-hard bookworms among us, so placing this inherent love at the heart of as many novels as possible was a natural move. This may well be the case, although I hope that there are more of us out there reading. I would prefer to think of us as the vanguard leading more reluctant readers towards the gems of writing that exist. In anycase this novel will certainly appeal to those of us who can see the redemptive power of the arts."}], "description": "Fukuoka Prison, 1944. Beyond the prison walls, the war rages.
