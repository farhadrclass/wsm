It's a shame really. In the South, we follow that up with \"Bless his heart.\"Oh, and you'd better believe that casserole will contain butter and meat. We'll bless your heart and then clog it up with saturated fat. It's tradition.Our hero is a character who has been around since the first book and has always been funny, charming, and cool. We want him to have the best life-mate ever, right?Um... yeah. His life-mate is kind of a bitch. They start their relationship with her screaming at him and calling him names because he didn't know she was picking him up from the airport and took a taxi instead. It's supposed to be cute and/or funny because she is yelling in Portuguese, but that doesn't give a reason for her freaking out in the first place. Also, she was pissed that she had to pick him up at all because he is not important enough in her eyes. She is the vice-president of a company, and he is just a nobody.Bless her heart. Isn't she precious?So the potential for a good romance was lost on a bad heroine.Next, we had \"the mystery\". They are searching for a couple of people who are missing and end up running all over Europe chasing the pings from a cell phone tower. The problem here was that the cell phone calls between the hero and his relatives ended up taking the spotlight over any other interaction. It was weird. Every minute, he was answering the phone and all of these phone calls were written out for us to have the glorious joy of reading. It was about as interesting as when someone insists on telling you their dream in detail..\"And then there was a bear. But it wasn't a bear. And then I was in the mall for some reason. And, I was looking for something and couldn't find it, and the store was weird......\"So, not only did this whole chasing around a cell phone suck, but they never actually found the people. That's right, the book just fizzled out at the end without any resolution.Why? What happened here? It's like the author had an unfinished, unedited version of the book sitting on her coffee table and someone picked it up and published it. What the hell?Also, there was a bad guy, you know, trying to kill the girl, and they never found out who he worked for either. Huh?Am I wrong to think that maybe some of these loose ends should have been tied up since this book was, you know, NOT a two-parter? Is it wrong for me to want an actual... I don't know... ending to the story? I mean, I don't want to be rude, but would it really be too much to ask? But, the author didn't seem to feel like giving us a satisfying conclusion to the story. Maybe she wanted to do one of those books where you have to use your imagination to end the story yourself. You remember those in school? And, how we all hated them? Yeah. It was like that.How my two sons ended every one of those.So, in conclusion......(See? it sucks when someone does that, right?)"}, {"userName": "Ivana Azap Feje\u0161", "userReviewDate": "Sep 28, 2017", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/26844635-ivana-azap-feje", "userReview": "The basis of this challenge was to read about someone else's BBF (Book Boyfriend), and I understand why Thomas would qualify. Book #8 in the Argeneau Vampire series, and Marguerite, the matriarch of the family is still missing, believed to be in England. As her only daughter was due to give birth and Marguerite hasn't checked in, all the family is very worried. Thomas, her nephew, but raised by her is the only one immediately available to go to England and start the search, the others will come when they can. Inez Urso, a VP in the English branch of the Argeneau family business is detailed to assist him. I loved Thomas in the previous books and thought he was incredible in this one. So sweet and caring and sexy.... I liked Inez's character. For someone who has little or no self confidence herself. However I loved how they still hadn't found Maugerite therefore leaving it open for more books. HOORAHH for that.Vampires Are Forever is the 8th book in the Argeneau series by the very talented Lynsay Sands. I've been reading this series for a while. When I need a good light vampire romance book to read, I look for Sands! If your familiar with this series, then you know you don't exactly have to read it in order. Although not the same, it's similar enough, or causes a similar enough reaction in me for one to serve for both. That's not to say these two novels are exactly formulaic; I think that anyone who reads the one will enjoy the other without ever having the here-we-go-again feeling rearing its ugly head. In fact, I liked it and it's series mate enough that I may well go in search of the remainder of the series\u2014very unusual for me and romances. So cheers to Ms. Sands, and to anyone who wants an easy, enjoyable read and a new set of wings hunge on ye olde bat, the Argeneau series may be for you. This was a light and fluffy vampire romance. The book was well-written and the characters relatable. It was an easy read, and even a picky reader such as myself didn't spot any technical issues. Argeneau isn't my favorite series, but I've only read three books so far. Very out of character for me, I know. Three words: Year Book Challenges. But, I did enjoy this one better than the last. I loved this book as well. It has some twists to it that keep you on edge, and rooting for things to go a certain way. It makes you feel like you are living in there with them. I felt my heart start to beat faster with each of theirs as if we were one person. Still loving this series I love how it's light hearted, funny and romanticce. This one was my favorite and I enjjoyed it.\n\"I'm Canadian. We're not responsible for Baywatch. You can't blame that on us.\"\"Just the Pamela Anderson part,\" Inez suggested with amusement.\"Only partially, I'm sure her implants are American,\" Thomas assured her...\" \"Have you tried to talk to her?\"\"What would you like me to say Bastien? Oh, I'm sorry, Inez.

I thought this book was ok, but a lazy effort. The author took very little time to explore who Inez and Thomas were. The big reveal about what he \"really\" did fizzled out with little interest. He never even discussed it with Inez. I did not feel that they were in a good place going forward. Not having worked out any logistics. I thought his family totally did them wrong and he let it go way too easily.The author has lost the romance in the last couple of books in favor of the overarching suspense plot.

ON THE PHONE~This is another instalment in the Argeneau vampire series with Thomas Argeneau as our hero this time. He's one of the younger immortals (at 200 years old) and when his aunt Marguerite goes missing Thomas is the only one in the family able to go to London and find her. Meeting him at the airport is Inez a corporate type from the family's U.K Company. She's been teamed with Thomas to help in the search because she knows London unfortunately she doesn't know anything about Vampires. Inez quickly begins to suspect though; Thomas is allergic to the sun, never seems to eat and has excellent night vision she's also pretty sure he just bit her neck. Thomas and Inez's search soon takes them to Amsterdam, which was a different and fun setting as they receive immeasurable phone tips, wonder the red light district and stop in several cafes and bars. The romance between our couple builds rather quickly as Thomas realizes Inez is his life mate. Inez in turn is uncertain about spending eternity with a guy she just met and doesn't relish the idea of drinking blood although the more she gets to know Thomas the more she likes him. After several more (annoying) phone calls Aunt Marguerite's trail takes them back to England where they again go to restaurants, bars and coffee shops and receive cell phone tips. After Thomas is injured Inez follows up on a lead by herself and briefly goes missing, when she returns she has no memory of where she was or who she was meeting. It seems that another immortal has taken control of her mind and erased the night's events. Now Thomas really has his hands full; he has to find Marguerite, figure out who's controlling Inez and then convince his lifemate to spend eternity with him. I've now read a couple of Lynsay Sands popular Argeneau series and they are generally quick reads with amusing stories. This instalment however just seemed to go nowhere with characters I couldn't get invested in. The romance was okay but I never really `felt the love'. I enjoyed the scenes in Amsterdam especially a funny sub plot where Thomas accidentally drinks ecstasy laced blood and there are also some spirited conversations as Inez comes to terms with Thomas's true nature but as a whole this story dragged. The vampire lore while original as in past books annoyed me with the continual `popping' into bags of blood. My biggest frustration though would have to be the amount of cell phone use. It was almost as if `the cell' was a character of its own with Thomas's cousin Bastien checking in every 5 minutes, someone else tracing calls and reporting back and Tomas and Inez calling each other and assorted family members. Its no wonder the story never went anywhere, I mean the first time the phone rang interrupting their kiss or conversation it was cute but by the fifteenth ring it was just frustrating.

I found some dozen paperbacks added to the bookcase in the upstairs hall at the beach house, and this was one of four that I elected to take to read, but I almost skipped this one, as its cover shows a lurid picture of two nearly naked people huddled in a hug, with the male having a tattoo showing a bat superimposed over the moon, while the lady in his arms, wearing a slip, has long light-colored hair. If I had known her hair actually was red, I would have been more interested, but the tattoo turned me off\u2014however, I have been made aware that there is a spate of romance novels about vampires lately (most likely as a spin off from Buffy the Vampire Slayer, and I wanted to stay in touch, so I took it, even though I suspected the vampirism was going to turn out to be a bad vehicle for sex. That was a good guess, as it turns out, but I suspect I am going to look for others in the Argeneau series, not because I find the sex exciting but because I am interested in the development of the plot. The Argeneaus, it turns out, is one of several families of vampires, all of whom are descendants of a group of research subjects in Atlantis, where scientists wanted to experiment with nanoorganisms injected into the bloodstream to fight sickness. The nanos fought sickness so well that the subjects did not die, even when Atlantis fell, and they or their descendants live among us, usually running family-owned and managed businesses. Apparently Lynsay Sands has written several novels about different members of the family. This one features Thomas, who was born in 1794, and Inez Urso, born in 1979, who is Portugese but has been promoted to a vice-president position in the British branch of the Argeneau\u2019s family business, which\u2014are you ready for this?\u2014involves shipping blood to hospitals (which is a great cover for shipping it to thirsty vampires all over the world). Inez, by the way, does not have straight hair hanging down her back, as shown in the cover; throughout the novel she is bedeviled by the fact that her hair is always tightly curled but sticks out in every which direction. [I have never understood why the cover illustrators don\u2019t actually read the books they illustrate \u2026 or, even more to the point, why the editors who do read the books do not raise some objection about cover art that clearly depicts something amiss!]The story line here is that Thomas\u2019s aunt, who raised him, decided to become a detective but has suddenly disappeared somewhere in Europe while on a case, and Thomas volunteers to go look for her. His uncle, who is the CEO of the company, assigns Inez the task of meeting Thomas at the airport and helping him with the search \u2026 but things change when Thomas dashes off to the hotel without her, because he was not told that anyone would be meeting him; he apologizes for having been rude to her by ordering her breakfast and drawing a hot bath for her in the hotel suite so that she can relax while he rests from the night-long journey (see, the nanos are sensitive to sunlight, so the immortals try to avoid it) \u2026 but then he wakes up thirsty and bites her, only to discover that she apparently is his lifemate, since he cannot read her mind or control it. The rest of the book is the continuing search for Aunt Marguerite, in London, Amsterdam, and York, while Inez fights off her growing feeling for Thomas and then the decision of whether she wants to be turned into a vampire herself, which is a scary decision, despite the fact that she finds immortal sex is rather wonderful."}, {"userName": "Natasha", "userReviewDate": "Apr 15, 2010", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/2496802-natasha", "userReview": "Vampires Are Forever is the 8th book in the Argeneau series by the very talented Lynsay Sands. I've been reading this series for a while. When I need a good light vampire romance book to read, I look for Sands!If your familiar with this series, then you know you don't exactly have to read it in order. They all star a different couple, that is based around the Argeneau family. I always was a fan of Thomas Argeneau from the first joke he cracked. He is the \"younger\" of the Argeneau family, and isn't really taken as serious as he should be. But he starts to prove his seriousness when he meets a feisty woman who yells at him in Portuguese. How could this little woman fit all that voice inside her? The woman in question is Inez Urso. A business associate of Thomas & her boss being the stern Baisen Argeneau. She's an excellent worker and loyal to the business, but can she still be loyal to a business of vampires? One of which being her to-be life mate? She's worked so hard to get where she is now in the company... she won't give up so easy. Another good read from Lynsay Sands! I've enjoyed this whole series, but I found this novel to lack the magnetic attraction process between Inez and Thomas. Maybe it's because they were mostly worried about Thoma's missing aunt, but I found knowing they were to be each others life mate so early on, lost some of the excitement. That's just me though. I still found the book a fun read, and well written as always. I found could have been a great novella more so than a book though. It felt like a middle story in the series.

However, space the books in this series out because reading them right after each other can become tedious.I enjoy the characters in these series so much, but the storylines are just so weak. The dialog between Thomas and Inez is witty and entertaining, so why can't their story be the same? The author was trying to weave a \"mystery\" into what are basically light-hearted vampire romances. Stick to the romance because the mystery was flat.Specifically, when Inez is trying to figure out Marguerites whereabouts. I understand that the number of people in her party seven down to five (oh no, where are the other two people? who are they?) probably matters in the next book. However, the way Inez came up with it and kept repeating in her head like it was so important felt really forced.I don't like it when authors think the reader is too dumb to draw inferences. We don't need the logic spelled out for us 1,2,3,4. We can get from 1 to 3 especially in these uncomplicated plots.I wish these books could go back to being light, witty romances. Even the romance in this book was getting boring. Thomas and Inez could have been steamy but their love scenes were dull. Thank goodness for small favors. At least there was not the requisite grocery shopping or clothes shopping scene in this book. News flash! Not all women find shopping fun especially housewives who read this stuff and are forced to go to the grocery store twenty times a week.I will still keep reading this series even with my critiques because they are light and fun.

While the hero and heroine actually do a better job than other couples getting from like and lust to love, I felt there should have been more of a physical draw (a common issue with Sands' writing), even with the constant interruptions of the search for Maurgerite. I've begun noticing that Sands has an odd habit of introducing potential sources of conflict and then not resolving them - case in point is Thomas' music, which was ridiculed by his late uncle and which he has hidden from all but a few relatives, content to be known as a shirker rather than suffer their dismissal. We are given to believe this is actually a lucrative job as he discusses the difficulty of writing the score for a comedy while being worried about finding his aunt. Inez, our heroine, makes a really dismissive (and honestly extremely offensive - it took me a couple chapters to warm back up to her) mental note about him being a \"doodler of musical notes,\" thinking it easy for him to relocate and be with her if the lifemate piece worked out. That would have been an inexcusable alpha asshole comment if it had come from a male hero, yet our heroine didn't have anything resembling that domineering personality. And if music was such a huge part of Thomas' life, why not show it? He never refers to music, discusses it with Inez, or even comments on sound around him. The way the author chooses to not show this side of the hero seems not only like sloppy writing, but also is an incredible missed opportunity. How much more satisfying would it have been to have a heroine impressed and proud of his musical ability? And to show the hero's acceptance and pride in himself as a point of emotional growth?But the strangest and most jarring character decision undoubtedly came from Sands' decision to paint the heroine as mega-career woman utterly focused on the job and worthy of her weighty vice-president title yet have her jaunt off to help Thomas AND NEVER ONCE THINK ABOUT HER UNFINISHED WORK OR CONTACT HER OFFICE. Seriously? I'm not even a VP but I send some emails and certainly touch base multiple times. If something is unexpectedly keeping me out of the office, I'm arranging for coverage and checking in. This weird choice honestly kept jarring me out of what was an otherwise forceful narrative of the family's attempts to find a missing loved one.This is a good series - not a great one - but I think this particular installment was more focused on pushing the larger multi book story arc along rather than of fleshing out the particular couple it was designed to showcase, which was a shame."}, {"userName": "Tara Quan", "userReviewDate": "Aug 19, 2013", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/15871065-tara-quan", "userReview": "3.5 Stars, rounded up to 4 because my issues were mostly a matter of personal taste. Read as part of the Gotta Have Paranormal Romance With a Kick Group  Hunk Alert ChallengeThis was a light and fluffy vampire romance. The book was well-written and the characters relatable. It was an easy read, and even a picky writer such as myself didn't spot any technical issues. The basis of this challenge was to read about someone else's BBF (Book Boyfriend), and I understand why Thomas would qualify. He's a genuine all-around nice guy. After his aunt Marguerite goes missing in London, he travels there and meets Inez. She is a human who works for his cousin's company and is tasked to assist him. As per the life-mate based vampire romance formula, he soon discovers she is \"the one.\" Passions ignite while they do a London-Amsterdam tour in search for his aunt. (By the way, if anyone is planning a trip to Amsterdam, this book would make for a great travel guide). Up until I was 60% through, this was on track to be a 5 star read. I was having a \"Where has Lynsay Sands been all my life?\" moment. But my interest fizzled, and I think it was because I wasn't convinced Thomas and Inez loved each other. Inez went from \"I'm not sure about the guy who just bit me\" to \"I love you Thomas\" really quickly. Thomas was just \"in love\" with Inez from the moment he realized she was his life mate without there being much reason behind it. I don't have an issue with the life-mate trope (I'm a fan of both Kresley Cole and Christine Feehan), but it was so played down in this book (no explosive passion, biological imperative to mate, recognition on the female side, linked minds, consuming lust, etc.). While it served as a good starting point for the relationship, I didn't feel it was a compelling enough reason in and of itself. I kept waiting for the romance to amp up, but instead the second half was more focused on the external conflict.All in all, this was an enjoyable read. It started off very strong, and I was thoroughly entertained. I would probably read another book by this author if I can find one with a more bad-boy type hero (the other reason this didn't nab a higher rating is because I'm not a nice-guy hero type of gal)."}, {"userName": "t'irla ~The Bookslayer~ t'irla's Talk Book Blog", "userReviewDate": "Aug 16, 2011", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/5601870-t-irla-the-bookslayer-t-irla-s-talk-book-blog", "userReview": "Where did my fun, carefree Thomas go?Description:Inez Urso notices that her new business associate, Thomas Argeneau, has some interesting traits: an allergy to sunlight, excellent night vision, and not much of an appetite for food.

However there were a few things that kinda disappointed me. Firstly, this Thomas seems sooo different from the Thomas we had seen in the previous novels. He could have been a different character. The Thomas who I adored was funny, direspectful, carefree, intuitive. This Thomas was serious, sappy, respectful, down trodden, almost morose at the ending. His lifemate Inez didn't feel like a good match. She started out ok...loved when she raged at him in Portuguese. Other wise I think she sorta sucked the fun out of the book. I didn't understand why LS brought up that Thomas had known a Urso a century ago but didn't go anywhere with it. Thomas didn't even mention it to Inez. I got annoyed with Thomas relying on Bastien for everything. He didn't have to organize a thing himself. Also, Thomas's music has come up a couple of times in the last few books and again Inez brought it up after seeing his notebook...again that discussion went no where and was never returned to. I did enjoy the interaction with past heroes and heroines and the bring the family together for the most part. I was really looking forward to Thomas's book and am disappointed it was \"my\" Thomas in it. 3.5 Star rating for me....would have been just a 3 star but the action and mystery got the extra star.

Inez, Bastien's most valued employee, is sent to meet Thomas at the airport in England. The couple has their ups and downs on their way to their HEA, as all do. Some were cute (he blows right passed her in the airport unaware she's picking him up), some where funny (dosed blood bags meant for a club) and some where action packed (battles with the baddies ensued). Overall, I thought the pairing of these two was a good fit. Other Argeneau family members pop up throughout, so readers will get a peek at what's going on with them as well. This book was a nice, light/quick read.

As her only daughter was due to give birth and Marguerite hasn't checked in, all the family is very worried.Thomas, her nephew, but raised by her is the only one immediately available to go to England and start the search, the others will come when they can.Inez Urso, a VP in the English branch of the Argeneau family business is detailed to assist him. Due to Bastien, the boss, being distracted he fails to tell Thomas he's being picked up at the airport and Inez that she is helping him find Marguerite.Once the misunderstandings are sorted, Thomas realises Inez is his lifemate, but then the attacks start happening. There were some very funny moments, as always ...\"I'm Canadian. We're not responsible for Baywatch. You can't blame that on us.\"\"Just the Pamela Anderson part,\" Inez suggested with amusement.\"Only partially, I'm sure her implants are American,\" Thomas assured her...\"  and\"Have you tried to talk to her?\"\"What would you like me to say Bastien? Oh, I'm sorry, Inez. I didn't mean to bite you, my fangs slipped.\" This is one of those series that is easy to read, well written, fun, fluffy, lighthearted, but ultimately you'll read the next one when you get around to it or you need a pick-me-up."}, {"userName": "Catherine", "userReviewDate": "Aug 11, 2013", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/7411485-catherine", "userReview": "Maybe it's because I jumped in to the series at book 8 (for a group challenge read), but this just fell utterly flat for me. The dialogue was stilted and varied between formal and silly slang. The mystery that had everyone on edge wasn't really a mystery at all and was just brushed aside by the end of the book. The vampires seemed somewhat weak with no blood-lust or savagery too them that so often lends to their 'danger appeal.' Inez was kind of a dud as were most of the other women in this story. It was a story that I've read many times before but written far more compellingly than this one. The bit that seemed to want to set it apart from a million other 'vampire brothers' series was the origin story. I won't give any details but it was just silly and completely unbelievable. I'll put the first of the series on my to-read list, maybe this was just a weak link in a stronger chain, but I'm in no rush to get to it. Oh, and that cover? Really? I don't think those people were even in this book!"}, {"userName": "The Flooze", "userReviewDate": "Jan 29, 2009", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/355739-the-flooze", "userReview": "Probably my least favorite so far. I loved Thomas' character in the preceding books, and thought the search for Marguerite would be intriguing. To my dismay, nothing much happens in this book--apart from Thomas' lifemate constantly berating herself.Inez' insecurity was tiring. There are countless moments throughout the book when, despite Thomas' obvious interest, Inez harps on her inadequacies. Even mid-makeout session, she's so busy wishing she were a leggy blonde, she tunes out Thomas' roving hands. Really? Is the man that unskilled, or is she just freakishly neurotic? (I'm thinking the latter, because of course we all KNOW immortals are fabulous in bed.) Overall, this one feels a lot like filler, lacking both in plot and in Sands' trademark humor. Hopefully the next book (Marguerite's!) will put things back on track."}, {"userName": "Samantha", "userReviewDate": "Feb 07, 2008", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/697986-samantha", "userReview": "Well this wasn't the best of the series. I was a little disappointed with Thomas' book. I had enjoyed him as a minor character in the series most of the way because of his personality. However in this book which is supposed to be his main book, he's almost a filler. The main mystery is about how his aunt has disappeared. I love that it brings all the other couples back from the series but this is Thomas' book. I didn't feel the connection between him and Inez. I felt the ending was extremely rushed and it left you hanging on the mystery. Basically this is just a filler book until you get to the main book which is the next one, Vampire Interrupted. Not sure that I can recommend this one as strongly as I did Ms. Sands' other books because it was so weak."}, {"userName": "Bronwyn Rykiert", "userReviewDate": "Nov 03, 2010", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/4479769-bronwyn-rykiert", "userReview": "This is book 8 in the Argeneau series.Thomas Argeneau goes to London to look for his Aunt Marguerite who has disappeared.

Love this series. I am happy when I am able to grab up one of these books. Each book from the series can be read on its own. This one was full of mystery! Tracking down a missing person.Thomas and Inez tried to figure out this lifemate business as well as a missing person case! The chemistry was great!Some of the story was wrapped up, but it was still a cliffhanger. I need to find the next in the series so I can find out what happens. yes, I know I just said you can read each without the others!!!!! This is no different- it does have a semi happy ever after.

It has some twists to it that keep you on edge, and rooting for things to go a certain way. It makes you feel like you are living in there with them. I felt my heart start to beat faster with each of theirs as if we were one person. I really enjoyed the battles and the romance equally. I am not one big on battle, but when they are put in these texts I would love to be wrapped up in them. I could feel each touch, hear each sound, and thought each thought as if they were my own.

I just can't get into Ms. Sands books. To be fair I have only read a novella and this book(which I am reading for a challenge).

Like all of Sands' books it had the witty humor along with the mystery.

And after reading of everyone close to Thomas finding life mates I was happy to finally read his."}, {"userName": "JLT", "userReviewDate": "Feb 04, 2018", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/18584357-jlt", "userReview": "I'm reading/listening to this series in order, so this is the 8th book in the Argeneau series I've read and it is by far the worst, in my opinion. This is mostly due to the whole lifemate thing Sands has going for her vampires. A lifemate is someone a vampire can't mindread or control and therefore a perfect partner. I get it, obviously such a great power imbalance where one partner could read and control the other wouldn't work out well, and I also get why it is not an every day occurrance for a vampire to meet someone/a mortal they can't read. Lifemates are generally described as being on the same wavelength, liking similar things, and being sexually attracted to each other. It makes complete sense that this doesn't happen every day. But there is nothing in Sands' vampire backstory that would require it to be a (very likely) once in a lifetime event, especially for vampires who live for a very long time. As it is, the vampire just has to get the not-mindreadable person somehow, otherwise he or she is doomed for a life alone. A desperate hero is not very romantic. In this book, Thomas has probably less than 10 minutes of interaction with Inez before he finds out he can't read her mind. The bigger part of this interaction is that she turns up in his hotel and berates him in Portuguese, which he finds \"cute\". He's on the phone with his cousin while this is happening who explains to him that she was supposed to pick him up at the airport and he apparently missed her there which is why she's so angry. He orders breakfast and draws her a bath (WTF?) since she didn't have time for a shower or a cup of tea before she went to the airport, and then goes to sleep. The next interaction is Thomas forcibly kissing her to make her ready for his bite because he needs a snack before he catches a flight. Yes, she is totally into it after a fashion and she found him attractive and \"considerate\" at this point but the kiss still came out of the blue. He bites her and then fails to read her mind and Boom! Lifemate! Suddenly, she's the only woman for him and he must have her. There was no real previous attraction, he was perfectly happy to bite her, wipe her mind and never see her again just a couple minutes ago. Where's the romance in that?Sands avoids this problem in the previous book (The Accidental Vampire) by having Victor avoid trying to read Elvi's mind since he's so attracted to her that he is afraid to find out that he can read her mind after all. But in this book we have Thomas who - as Sands blithely tells us - thinks that it's just no fun after a century or two to mind-control beautiful women to sleep with him and that's why he absolutely needs Inez to stay. My heart melts.There are also incongruencies in the vampire lore both with previous books and in this one. Thomas tells Inez that it was a total downturn to constantly hear the thoughts of not-lifemate women he was with, even though even in this book he has to actually focus on a person to read their thoughts. In previous books, the vampires often didn't realise for a while that they couldn't read their lifemate. In Bite Me If You Can, Lucian doesn't try to read Leigh because he finds her annoying in the beginning and we are told that he usually doesn't read minds. Victor in Accidental Vampire doesn't try to read Elvi's mind. And here, Thomas apparently can't avoid to constantly read the minds of women even though that is not a problem with any other person he meets, including Inez, otherwise he would have realised immediately after meeting her that he can't read her mind. Vampires are increasingly described as these pathetic beings who are bored of food, sex, and life itself who prefer being alone to the point that I'm wondering why they don't kill themselves in droves if all this being forever young, rich and immortal is just too much for them to bear.As for the rest of the book, it's not much better. Inez is an intelligent, driven career woman with absolute confidence in her abilities in her job who thinks it is beneath her to pick Thomas up at the airport because he's a slacker based on her snap judgement and she has no problem shewing him out for walking past her. But outside the job she is a neurotic bundle of insecurities who can't even handle a few drunk guys who hit on her. The first time in bed with Thomas she constantly berates herself about every part of her \"imperfect\" body (she's not a \"leggy blonde\" and has stubble on her legs, that poor woman) and questions Thomas' attraction to her despite the fact that Thomas has a visible boner for her in about 75% of the book and almost raped her in an alley because under the influence of a form of vampire viagra he wasn't able to control her lust for her, nevermind that he wants to spend eternity with her. Gah. I listened to the audiobook where Inez sounds like an upset 9-year old, which didn't help my opinion of her, either.I'll leave it to others to write about the plot of the book, I wasn't too impressed with it. At least half the book is them running around in Amsterdam looking for Thomas' aunt Marguerite while getting phone calls and after that I didn't pay that much attention anymore.I seriously hope the next book is better than this one because otherwise I need something else to read."}], "description": "Vampires Don't Exist...Do They?Inez Urso is beginning to have her doubts.
