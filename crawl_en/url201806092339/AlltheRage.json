This is the most visceral reaction to a book that I have ever had. This is the most personal book review that I will ever write. Because there is nothing more personal than what I am about to tell you. If depictions of rape are triggers for you, back away now.They say the devil\u2019s in the details. I disagree. Details are nothing more than the pieces of truth we choose to bring to light. Everyone knows the devil can\u2019t abide the light. His kingdom is rooted in the shadowy realm of the unknown. His throne is built on lies. You can find him in the blank spaces in between the details. In those dark corners we don\u2019t want anyone to see. Courtney Summers understands this. She provides just enough illumination to cast long, dark shadows, allowing plenty of space for the devil to hide. I don\u2019t agree with whoever wrote the blurb for this book. It doesn\u2019t do it justice. It oversimplifies. This book is not about the struggle of a young woman to find her voice and save others from suffering a fate similar to her own. Not really. This book is about the brutal reality of what it\u2019s like to be a teenage girl. It subtly details all the ways that rape culture pervades our everyday lives and manipulates us into perpetuating it. It\u2019s about how the voices and opinions of young girls are silenced, even by the \u201cgood guys\u201d. It\u2019s about how our thoughts and emotions are rendered invalid when someone with a penis contradicts us. It\u2019s about how we turn on each other, because it\u2019s easier to believe that someone is lying than it is to think that someone else you know did something unthinkable to that person. It\u2019s about what no one talks about; what happens to survivors of rape. How that act of violence defines you, sometimes for years afterward, even as you resist it. How even as a survivor, you still feel like a victim. It\u2019s about having your freedom stolen from you. Having your innocence ripped to shreds. Having your voice ignored. It\u2019s about being dominated. Sublimated. Deconstructed down to body parts. It\u2019s about hating those body parts afterward and resenting everything they represent. It\u2019s about hiding what you are. Clothing yourself in costumes and camouflaging yourself with makeup. Because if you look different, you are different. You\u2019re not the girl that thing, that terrible thing happened to. You\u2019re someone new. Someone different. Someone it might not happen to again. It\u2019s about questioning yourself. Silencing yourself. Being silenced by others, in ways so minute and insidious that you don\u2019t even realize it\u2019s happening. It\u2019s about hopelessness. Loss. Shame. Terror. This book isn\u2019t about the light. It\u2019s about the shadows. About the places the devil lurks. It was those shadows I found myself drawn to while reading this. Those critical details of Romy\u2019s story that Summers chose to obscure. Trouble was, I filled them with my own memories. This is my story:When I was 18, I was raped. Up until that point I had lived a charmed life. I grew up in an affluent beach community. It was and still is a liberal bastion of tolerance and acceptance. Nothing bad ever happened there. At least not anything you talked about in public. I had parents who loved me. Who didn\u2019t force a traditional gender role upon me, but instead encouraged me to discover for myself who I was and what being female meant. They were well-educated hippies, aware enough of rape culture to start lecturing me at a young age on the importance of knowing my surroundings, of never taking a drink from a stranger, of avoiding dark alcoves and poorly lit parking lots. I had a solid group of friends all through school, mostly male, but with two female friends so close we were called The Three Musketeers. I was athletic, pretty, and popular. I got voted best dressed in our yearbook, made the junior and senior prom courts, had so many friends I lost count, and was invited to every party. One hot summer night shortly after graduation one of my friends\u2019 older cousins blew into town. He was everything I\u2019d been raised to believe in. A golden child. Handsome. Rich. Charming. The moment he walked into the room, I smiled. There was just something about him that made him irresistible. It manifested itself in the way my female friends leaned toward him when he spoke. In the way my male friends threw him jealous glances. His family had a summer cottage on the beach. After a night of club hopping, he invited us all back there. I\u2019d drank just enough to feel tipsy. I was in that brief phase of inebriation where everything is magical. It was then that he turned to me and slipped an arm around my waist. It was after midnight, and yet the sun came out and shone down upon me in that moment. I couldn\u2019t believe he had signaled me out. I couldn\u2019t believe I was so lucky. He twined his fingers through mine and led me away from the others an hour later. The two musketeers I left behind sent me conspiratorial winks and \u2018Go get em, Tiger\u2019 looks over their red keg cups. I winked back and laughed. When we reached his bedroom he closed the door behind us and pressed me against the wall. He was tall and muscular. Tall enough that he had to lean down to kiss me. Muscular enough that he easily lifted me by the hips when he got tired of that and instead pinned me to the wall. I wrapped my legs around him, my head spinning, because I was a virgin, and this was the hottest moment of my life. Or was it because I had passed that magical point of inebriation and had crossed into the realm of intoxication? I couldn\u2019t tell, and at that point, I didn\u2019t really care. We made our way from the wall to the bed, where moonlight fell across the black sheets in long arcs of silver. He threw me down amongst them and covered me with his large body. We made out some more. He took his pants off. My dress hit the floor soon afterward. We switched positions, and I left a trail of kisses from his chin to his boxers, lavishing every glistening, tanned ridge of muscle in between with attention. He growled and flipped us, so that I was once again on bottom. Then his boxers came off. I wrapped a hand around him. It was when he started to slip my panties off and angled himself toward the apex of my thighs that I balked. I realized what his endgame was. Sex. I hadn\u2019t been thinking sex. Because I wasn\u2019t in the habit of having it. I had been thinking oral. Should have voiced that sooner, I guessed. My bad. I quickly amended my mistake. \u201cOh, no. I\u2019m not going to have sex with you,\u201d I told him. I smiled then, attempting to dull the rejection. \u201cLet\u2019s switch. Let me go down on you.\u201dHe didn\u2019t smile back. His entire mood changed. I felt it happen even before his lips turned down in a frown. Violence crept into the bedroom with us, wrapped its cold fingers around my heart and squeezed. I shook it off. I rejected the instinct that screamed at me that something wasn\u2019t right. I rationalized it away as an overreaction. Because fifteen people were in the next room playing flip cup and beer pong. He wouldn\u2019t dare do something terrible to me with so many potential witnesses. His frown disappeared as quickly as it had emerged, replaced by a megawatt smile that lit the room up. He leaned down and kissed me again, stealing my breath away. And then he did something terrible to me. Like I said, the devil is in the blank spaces, isn't it? And I could fill those in for you. I could tell you the horrific thing he said to me when I bled the evidence of my virginity away, the words I still hear in my nightmares. But I'll let you fill in the blanks, because then you'll understand just what you're getting yourself into with this book. The point is. None of this should have happened.I was safe. My friends were right outside the door. It shouldn\u2019t have happened. I did everything right. It shouldn\u2019t have happened. But it did.Because in the end, nothing had prepared me for this.All my parents\u2019 lessons couldn\u2019t have prevented me from freezing, because though they had taught me to do everything right leading up to this moment, they hadn\u2019t taught me what to do when someone ignored me. They didn\u2019t tell me what to do when someone covered my mouth to silence my whimpers of, \u201cNo, please stop.\u201dThey didn\u2019t warn me about the crippling shame. The embarrassment. They didn\u2019t tell me that I should scream. That I should fight.Rape culture had filled in these blanks. Rape culture had taught me how to be the perfect victim. And where my parents\u2019 lessons ended, rape culture stepped in to fill the blanks. My parents had taught me how to avoid becoming a victim. But society taught me how to become the perfect victim when someone victimized me. That night, society won. The next morning I slipped out the door while everyone slept. I drove home in the pre-dawn light, with tears streaming down my face and blood coating the inside of my thighs. It took me a full month to admit to myself that I\u2019d been raped, another two weeks before I drunkenly confessed this to my friends. I could tell by their looks that they didn\u2019t want to hear it. No, don\u2019t tell us this terrible thing. He was nice. He was beautiful. He wouldn\u2019t do what you\u2019re saying. I didn\u2019t stick around long enough for their thoughts to make their way to their mouths. Unlike Romy, the main character in this story, I was free. I had graduated. I came from money. I had savings in the bank. And I took that savings and used it to MOVE OUT OF THE FUCKING COUNTRY. That\u2019s how far away I had to get. It wasn't far enough. But Romy is stuck, and this book depicts everything that might have happened to me had I stuck around. The shock of others, the disbelief, the blaming, the shaming, the hatred. This book shows you what happens when you speak up. What happens when you stick around after you speak up. So pay attention. When you think the story drags, look closer. Peer deeper at that random bit of dialogue you think could have been cut in the editing process, because I promise you, it\u2019s there for a reason. It\u2019s showing you something. A glimpse into the life of a survivor. How impossible it seems that you\u2019ll be believed when you tell someone you\u2019ve been raped. Because when you get tripped by a guy in track and it\u2019s his word versus yours, they believe his. Because when you tell someone a person got in your face they tell you you\u2019re overreacting. And this is from the \u201cgood guys\u201d. I\u2019m speaking up about my own story because of Romy. Because though she might be fictional, so many other women\u2019s stories aren\u2019t. My own included. We need to talk about this. We need to change our society. We need to stop teaching girls how to be victims. We need to stop teaching boys how to victimize us. And we need to do it now. Because one out of three women reading this knows exactly what I went through.

God, there are so many.\nThis story... these characters... those words... Courtney Summers has done it again.I don't think, on the whole, I am a person who is afraid of much. I'd even go so far as to say I have a somewhat reckless, risk-taking personality at times. But I am scared of a few things... you want to know what one of my biggest fears is? Telling the truth and having no one believe me. Honestly, I think that's truly terrifying. Knowing you're being honest, knowing what you know, and being powerless to do anything about it. That's the first reason this book affected me so much.What I mentioned above is a running theme behind the scenes of this story, but Summers incorporates many other elements that she excels at. For one, the author has an incredible understanding of teen girl politics - as shown previously in Some Girls Are. I should mention this book is nasty, graphic and contains some coarse language, but I guess that's high school for you. \u2026how can you put something so golden, a girl who can barely open her eyes or her mouth - how can you put something like that in front of them and expect them to be better people?Summers' writing improves with every book she releases, writing scenes with words that manage to somehow be beautiful and horrific at the same time. But most of all, she has a talent for getting inside the thoughts, feelings, worries and insecurities of teenage girls. She paints unlikable characters and still breathes humanity into them, something that so few authors can do successfully.As well as all of this, All the Rage also looks at small town life and the alliances that can exist within small communities of people. It makes it easy for your crimes to be overlooked if you're friends with the right people, or be called a liar if you're not.I want to explain to you why I think her books are so different from other YA \"issue\" novels that deal with angsty teens, but it's difficult to do without just pushing one of her books into your hands. I guess there's something very raw, painful and honest about her stories that still steers clear of emotional manipulation. Even the characters we are supposed to find sympathy for are complex and flawed in their own way. I like that. I hope she writes more soon because, as you may have guessed, I'm an unapologetic fangirl.Blog | Facebook | Twitter | Instagram | Tumblr"}, {"userName": "Lola  Reviewer", "userReviewDate": "Apr 09, 2015", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/14596170-lola-reviewer", "userReview": "I just finished this and, oh my book, I need to breathe, I need to breathe, I need to breathe...\nhe covers her mouth.\n\n That\u2019s how you get a girl to stop crying; you cover her mouth until the sound dies against your palm.\nEverything this girl has been through \u2013 what she\u2019s going through, throughout the story \u2013 scared me. I know how it can feel like for someone to be bullied in school and picked at, having lived it myself when I was in middle school, but middle school and high school are two different worlds. In high school, people are meaner, cleverer in their scheming and they KNOW where to hurt and at what moment. The perfect moment when the hit will have triple impact.But Romy\u2026 she\u2019s been raped. It was obvious in the story that she stills had scars from that awful night \u2013 with reason, I don\u2019t think you can ever forget something like that \u2013 but, you will see, she\u2019s still pretty damn strong. I would even say that she\u2019s stronger than I am, mentally speaking, since I don\u2019t think I could have survived something like that and, on top of that, being treated like trash by my classmates.It also scared me to see how a POLICE OFFICER can be so inconsiderate and act in a way that would make you ask yourself who is the adult between Romy and that aforementioned officer. I hated him. I\u2019m one hundred percent sure you\u2019ll hate him too. But that\u2019s okay; after all, that was the author\u2019s purpose \u2013 to make us hate him \u2013 for sure. Hell though, so many things to rage over in this book. So much unfairness.This was my first book by Courtney Summers and I must confess I never would have picked it up if it weren\u2019t for the beautiful reviews on Goodreads praising this novel like crazy and making me feel like not reading it would be a sin. It isn\u2019t\u2026 but my god is it a book I wish to shove at everyone!There\u2019s also a love story \u2013 yay for diversity! \u2013 and Leon will grow on you.

(That is not a spoiler) This is the after effects of Romy's story. It begins with her using her nail polish and lipstick as armor against the hate from the small town that she lives throws at her. She accused the sheriff's precious son of rape. *gasp*Nothing happens to him at all. She is shunned at school so she builds up walls around herself. Never telling anyone what happened. Never talking about anything. Her mom tries to help but Romy has shut everyone out. \nThe Bad:The story jumps from NOW until TWO WEEKS LATER, but didn't really keep the storyline straight for me. I was confused with what was happening most of the time. I kept thinking things would clear up later in the book but for me it never really did.The main character Romy. I didn't care for her. I just didn't get enough of a sense of her personality that I never formed an attachment to her. I should have. In a book of this type you SHOULD rage for that girl. Every-time she would have something bad happen it seemed like she just made things worse for herself. Then she would never explain anything to anyone so it just became one big cluster fuck. I know that she had been traumatized and wasn't thinking straight but it was just too much for me.She has somewhat of a love interest in the book. I don't think it added to the story at all. It actually took away from it. She was so traumatized that a boy should not have entered into the picture yet.I wanted to feel more for these characters. This book has bullying even of her mom's boyfriend who is disabled due to a car accident. The townspeople openly mock him for being lazy. Then the whole thing with Romy should have had me furious. It just didn't.There is girl on girl hate........\n\nand through it all I just kept waiting on the story to really start.Now for the good:The book does have a powerful message and the writing is good. I love Courtney Summers so don't go thinking I'm hating on her. I'm not.The story line of a girl being shunned for accusing a popular boy of rape. This happens. The stories need told.

The two books\u00a0both about the effects and aftermath of rape and this is where the similarities stop.\u00a0Speak is a book I personally think should be required high school reading while ATR is a novel I could have gone without reading. It didn't pack the punch or have the impact on me that Speak did. The first thing I want to mention right away is that the summary for ATR is a bold face lie! \"Kellan Turner, is not the golden boy everyone thinks he is...\" Kellan isn't even in the story! He's not even a character in the book!!! He is barely even talked about... Second \"Branded a liar and bullied relentlessly by a group of kids she used to hang out with, Romy\u2019s only refuge is the diner where she works outside of town\"; she's branded a liar because she is a liar. No, she didn't lie about being raped, but that's basically the only thing she doesn't lie about. Third I'm pretty sure the place she works is still in town! Whoosh, sorry had to get that off my chest. I'll actually talk about Romy now. I hated her! Hated everything about her. Romy is kind of a dick. She is a loner because most of the school hates/bullies her. I completely get that that at school she might need that Super B front put up, but Romy was a dick to people she even liked. Her\u00a0mom, her kind of boyfriend, coworkers, you\u00a0name them she was a jerk to\u00a0them. She has no personality and I felt it very hard to relate to her\u00a0as a\u00a0character. She is\u00a0also one of the most bland characters\u00a0I've ever read. Even moments when she could have shed even the lightest bit of personality she doesn't.\u00a0I know she's suppose to be angry, sad, and depressed but come on she doesn't have to be boring too. I think her biggest problem is that she has no\u00a0development. Also I know her name is Romy, but I kept calling her Romney... which made me think of that episode of New Girl where Schmidt pretends to be related to Mitt Romney, so I had a hard time saying her name or taking it seriously\u00a0throughout the book.\nATR has no real plot. The plot it does have is all over the place. Summer's writing style is both choppy and confusing. The story starts with the \"Now\"-which turns about not really to be the now-then goes to two weeks earlier, which doesn't read as if it's two weeks earlier. I had to actually re-read the first three chapters because I was so confused about the timeline. Then closer to the end goes back to the now-which is actually now the now (lol). It just doesn't read well what so ever. I think the story would have read better if the events just went in order and didn't flip flop back and forth. ATR is suppose to be a story about a girl who is raped and how life is for her after, but it's more like a story about a girl just going about her day(s). No seriously, it's just a book about Romy sometimes going to school, sometimes going to work, and most the time just being rude. It just doesn't really go into details and the emotional level and depth just isn't reached. People warned me about the mature themes and language... Yes, there is some profanity but nothing over the top, and the mature themes are nothing we haven't read before. Trust me when I say\u00a0this\u00a0wont be why it's hard to read. \nBesides the huge problems with the characters and plot I also had a huge problem with the moments that should of had big reveals...\u00a0Romney is bullied at\u00a0school-plot builds builds builds- then falls flat. She gets super smashed at a party- plot builds builds builds-nothing happens. Girl\u00a0goes missing- plot build builds builds-\u00a0no surprise happens.\u00a0It's just all these random things thrown together that you expect to come together at the end and they just don't. All the Rage is a book I feel is way to overhyped.\u00a0It's choppy, confusing, dull, and will give you nothing but dead ends. \"With a shocking conclusion\" that will leave you very disappointed. Your best bet is to go\u00a0into this book with no expectations that way you wont be letdown.

And believe me when I say, announcing this to all of you anonymous faces over the internet is very scary, especially when I\u2019ve told less than five people until this day. But writing a book review about All the Rage wasn\u2019t enough. I need to convey to people in some way, that this book is a monumental movement that captures so much of the trauma forced on girls, even in this day and age. Romy\u2019s story, while much crueler than mine, still resonated so deeply with me because of the shared feelings: body shame, blaming ourselves, depression, denial, the list goes on. And not just feelings I shared with Romy, but cruel, unfair feelings that one in four girls will experience. Romy\u2019s story is one of a girl who was victimized, and because of the lack of support, the bullying, the inability to cope, she had developed a hatred for herself that runs so deep, it would\u2019ve destroyed her in the end. And this is the state of the world, even worse in places outside of my own country. All the Rage is not for the faint of heart. It\u2019s real, raw, gritty, completely and brutally honest as it examines the treatment of women today, from general abuse, to sexual assault, to sometimes even worse consequences. It\u2019s not a pretty book, but it\u2019s the truth that a lot of people don\u2019t want to face.All the Rage\u2019s main character is just a snap shot of what it could be like for millions and millions of women, and what it is for many. It\u2019s deftly written, honest, with startlingly real characters, and so many strong statements that it\u2019s painful but also enlightening to read. This book put feelings into words that I\u2019ve struggled with since I was a victim. I haven\u2019t read a book with such an honest and important portrayal of these issues since Laurie Halse Anderon\u2019s Speak. This book is more important to me, and could be to many others, than I could possibly put into words. It can help victims cope and put things to words, it can help others sympathize and understand, and it could help people make the movement towards fixing these issues. This book is an ugly, painfully honest portrayal of the struggles of more women than we can ever know, but maybe if people see the stark reality, we can make it better."}, {"userName": "Karlyflower *The Vampire Ninja, Luminescent Monster & Wendigo Nerd Goddess of Canada (according to The Hulk)*", "userReviewDate": "Apr 28, 2015", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/17243568-karlyflower-the-vampire-ninja-luminescent-monster-wendigo-nerd-godde", "userReview": "Trigger Warning: Rape\nMy finger has hovered over the delete button for a few minutes now, and decided to leave that warning, despite the fact that my attacker gave me no such courtesy.

I woke up one morning an innocent girl who had never been, and the next I was a girl who had been. Raped. How can five letters change your entire life? In every possible way, I assure you. All The Rage isn\u2019t my story - it\u2019s Romy\u2019s - but it is close enough to my story to cause anguish. To press against those moments that still feel like they own me, in a way, sometimes. I didn\u2019t rage reading this book, I broke. I broke in all the places that I hide myself, that I\u2019ve hid myself... for years. All the half-finished sentences, the thoughts that are just too much. What it feels like to not feel alone in your own body, to HATE that body. To have no fucking tears left but to be unable to stop miming the tears, dry-eyed and afraid of what comes next. What do you do after you STOP crying? How do you move past that moment?All The Rage is the story of Romy\u2019s afterwards. And it was a painful read for me, but a necessary one. It tells the story of a girl who has been forced to deal with \u2018the afterwards\u2019 and it is horrifying. How the filth of one person\u2019s action can stain EVERYTHING. A touch becomes unwelcome. A conversation... a chore. A cute boy, TERRIFYING.I can\u2019t figure out the kind of heart it takes to do something like this.I will never understand why my rapist did what he did, and neither will Romy. And that is, arguably, the hardest part. Summers did an interesting thing in All The Rage, she introduced a love-interest (and man I hissed all over the page when he showed up, guys, those pages are COVERED in saliva) to our main character. A nice boy, who really liked her. However, he didn\u2019t heal her. He broke her in new, disastrous ways. The ways \u2018the boy after\u2019 broke me. And this is one of those things that isn\u2019t talked about, that should be. What it feels like to NOT be threatened by a boy and feel even more threatened.

She reveals naked ugly truths (thanks for the term, Aunt CoHo) about people in her stories with assertion and undeniable truthfulness and for these things; my salute goes to her (always). But even though she wrote dark stories in the past including an apocalyptic duology with zombies in it, I think All the Rage is her darkest novel yet. It turns out I had good reasons all along by trying to avoid this book the longest time possible because (damn!), that was a seriously heavy read. I know I vowed to keep myself away from cheesy romances with happy endings but after reading this book, I think I\u2019d gladly go back to those comfort books. I emotionally and physically suffered through the story, at the sadness and grimness of the tone and the unkindness of the people. I don\u2019t understand why people would commune to aim for something really bad but it is a really sad and ugly fact that it does happen. People could do really ugly things. The entire narrative wasn\u2019t easy to read either because it seems a bit disjointed at times and there were certain places I\u2019m not sure I\u2019m reading a present event or a past. And yet despite the challenges I went through during the entire reading experience, I am once again thankful for yet another eye-opening novel that courageously takes on an issue most of us would rather avoid and develops it into a believable story, perhaps not that of a hero\u2019s or a survivor\u2019s story but of someone broken and lifeless and how she in spite of it all tries to keep moving on, how she could still have the strength to simply breathe and do the usual things she was supposed to do even after losing herself. In retrospect, she IS a survivor and even though there weren\u2019t real resolutions to the conflicts in the story like most Summers books, it ends with a tiny sliver of hope to the characters and to the reader and that little hope is all it really takes to make us believe that the good could still prevail.

This story revolves around a rape, and soon enough, you can add in a girl's disappearance. So yes, this book is harsh, and Summers tackles it head-on with her immensely poignant writing style. She has a way of dissecting her characters until you can't help but feel just as lost, just as completely broken as they are. I was honestly emotionally and psychologically confused for much of this novel. This book also touches on one of today's biggest challenges with gender violence - society's disbelief and victim blaming. Especially when the accused is the son of a prominent town figure. Stories like this are, sadly, the reality for many girls in our own world.With that said, this is not a story to tread lightly. This is not the book you pick up when you want a light read, or even just a diversion. This book will make you feel uncomfortable. It will put you into the skin of a girl who feels dirty, filthy\u2026 dead. It's not the kind of novel where you will connect with the character in the way one might expect. How can you connect with someone who's so broken, she doesn't even feel worthy of living? Instead, you become one with her. You become one, and you hope against all hope that she gets through this seemingly impossible hurdle - if it can even be called that. In other words, she's a character who forced me to stay at arm's length emotionally, if only to protect my sanity, while still drawing me entirely into her psyche. This girl does not only bear the weight of an assault, she also has to deal with being the school pariah. The person who \"cried rape\" while her peers bully and mock her for \"wanting attention\". What's worse is you can glimpse at what a wonderful person Romy truly is\u2026 or was. You can see that she is kind, caring, and only wants a freaking break! She harbors so much fear and mistrust, that she can't even see when someone good finally comes around.Leon is the light at the end of this tunnel, and I was glad that even though she doesn't see it, he brings at least a little bit of warmth to her life - to this book. I was so happy to see him not give up so easily, realizing that this isn't the real her, something is eating her up inside. Furthermore, there's her mom and step-dad who are both there for her, present at just the right times. Similarly, her job at the diner and this work dynamic is a welcome change from the isolation. It sort of becomes a safe haven for her and I loved that. When we're not focusing on Romy's internal struggles, the plot follows the disappearance of the only girl who gave Romy the benefit of the doubt. It's not a plot that ended up surprising me - even though I didn't guess every detail of what transpired, it's easy to predict the bigger picture. However, this story is more about what happened to Romy, than what's happening presently. It's about her finding the strength to at least try. As expected - having read Summers' books before - the ending is somewhat open ended, though full of hope. It's realistic, but I can't say I didn't wish for more. Like a short \"one year later\" prologue. But that's the thing with her books, you need to know her characters to be okay, so these somewhat open endings, while appreciatively realistic, can feel very abrupt. All the Rage is raw to the bone. It's painful, bitter, heartbreaking, and incredibly important. Summers has been an auto-buy for me from the very first page of hers I ever turned. She's a powerful storyteller, and she has done it again!--An advance copy was provided by the publisher for review.For more of my reviews, visit my blog at Xpresso Reads"}, {"userName": "Jaidee", "userReviewDate": "Aug 01, 2016", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/17295672-jaidee", "userReview": "4.5 \"heartbreaking, devastating, unflinching\" stars. 2016 Honorable Mention Read Romy could be your best friend or sister or cousin or daughter. Romy may have had a similar story to your mama, or auntie or even granny. Romy also has many male counterparts and perhaps this is your buddy, sweetheart, brother, uncle or papa. Think of all the people you hold dear to you and think of the secrets they may have never shared. One of them could be rape, sexual assault or molestation. Let this truth hit you, let it sink in, that somebody had the audacity, the cruelty, the sadism to hurt somebody that you love so very much. To humiliate them, violate them and perhaps turn them into a ghost or shadow. Perhaps this has happened to you.This is one narrative of millions. It is Romy's story and it tore my heart out, made me feel so very sad and like the title says full of rage.Romy is....a young woman hardly more than a child...working class poor....a social pariah....bullied by the girls and harassed by the boys....has lost all her friends....wants to love but feels she is a shell.....suffers from post-traumatic stress disorder....likely has a horrible future.....WAS RAPED AND NOT BELIEVEDA book so very powerful, realistic, gritty and raw.

One stress ball (two could work, but you'll need your other hand to flip pages. Duh.) - This book will make you so angry at how horrible some people can be. You'll want to scream, kick a brick, bite the head off a gummy bear... You get my point. The stress ball will help during these moments.2. A box of tissues - I don't know about the next guy, but this book made me tear up. You'll cry because you're going to want the best for the main character, but maybe she doesn't always get it. Maybe she'll be broken, and so will you. Just maybe.3. A couch with fluffy cushions and/or\u00a0your bed - This is important for when you're done reading the book. You're going to need a good place to lie down and think about life and how much you loved this book. Trust me, it's essential.\nAll the Rage Preparation Checklist (AKA Fabulous Things to Be Excited about):\n1. An admirable protagonist--check.\u00a0Romy's been through (and is still going through) a lot of shit in her life, and she feels that she believes what the people say: that she'd be better off dead. Despite that, Romy kept moving on. She's such a broken girl, a mix of your favorite and most despised characters all in one, which is just the way I like it. You guys are going to root for this one, for sure.2. An honest story--check. Sometimes people lie. But sometimes people tell the truth. And sometimes, people don't believe them. You're not going to love all of the characters in this book. In fact, you're going to loathe a lot of them, but for all the right reasons. You're going to hate people for being so close-minded and judgmental. You're going to hate them for not giving other people a chance.3. A fabulous mystery--check. Not sure if you got the memo, but this book has murder in it too. Okay, maybe you'll see the twist coming once we get closer to the big reveal, but every page will keep you on your toes. YOU CAN'T TRUST ANYONE, OKAY?4. A beautiful family--check. I just love Romy's parents! They're attentive to Romy, and they really do want what's best for her. Plus I totally love how her mom and step-dad are super cute together. (I'd totally read a spin-off about them. Courtney, I hope you can see my uncontrollable winking!)5. A sweet romance--check. I was not expecting this to have a romance (you'll get why when--when, not if--you start this), but I was pleasantly surprised by it! Leon was such a fantastic love interest. He was sweet, caring, and best of all, really considerate of Romy's situation.6. All the feels--check. Anger. Swoons. Depression. Joy. This book has it all, folks.*The only reason I didn't give this book 5 stars was because I had trouble with the then vs. now parts. It was hard for me to tell (despite the chapters clearly stating them) which events were currently happening and which happened before.So the gist of this review is that YOU NEED TO BUY THIS BOOK, AND YOU NEED TO BUY IT NOW.

Yeah the hell right. Did anyone really expect me to give this any less than a bajillion stars? I am still awaiting the day I'll pick up a Courtney Summers novel and not be floored by her simple words that portray deep, meaningful messages so many authors gloss over today. And even if that day comes? I know to the bottom of my soul, even if the story isn't for me, I will still write her name, like, ten times in my review because that's just what I do with my two favorite authors and because her words will never cease to have an impact on me. You know why? 'Cuz she's Courtney fuckin' Summers and she isn't afraid to get raw, gritty, and in your face.You know all the ways you can kill a girl?God, there are so many.\nIt's no secret that this woman snuck up out of nowhere and stole my heart with her magnificent and flawless writing. I know, beyond a shadow of a doubt, when I pick up a Summers book (anyone keeping a count of how many times I'll say her name?) that I will be transported to another world where someone doesn't have it as good as me. That I will not be the same after reading it. That I will never find an author who speaks to me on such a deep emotional level. That, during the story, I will learn something not only about a flawed, broken girl (or boy), but also about myself. Her novels aren't simply page-turners, though they are undoubtedly that, they mean something. They make you wonder, they make you think, \"Was I ever so blind to something like this?\" \"Was I as care-free and oblivious and go-with-the-flow that I was a part of someone's torment without even realizing it?\" And that's what Courtney Summers does-she doesn't simply write-she educates. She makes you aware. And this story was no exception.It's amazing how bad you can make the truth sound. As long as you keep it partially recognizable when you spit it out, a crowd will eat it up without even thinking about how hard you chewed on it first.Romy is a whole new level of broken. In Summers's previous works, we see lots of broken girls who don't quite know how to handle what they're going through, what they feel. I mean, they think they do...but do they ever really want to do what they think they need to do? Anyway-I digress. My point was that Romy is emotionally broken in a way that, while familiar from her other stories, I have never seen before. It's not like she lays down and takes it. She doesn't simply play dead and walk through the halls like a zombie. She has a bite that is unlike anything I've seen. It was deliciously depraved, some of things she had to do, but it was never over the top. This girl is someone who was bullied for speaking out against a rape no one believes happened, bullied for simply existing, bullied because she had the misfortune of being the only girl 'found.' The things she had to hear whispered behind her back and go through were unwarranted, nasty, and a catalyst to thoughts that a girl should never have about herself...or anyone, for that matter. I forget what I was doing. I forget what I'm here for. There's a point to all of this but I don't know what it is anymore.What we see, essentially, is a girl who has been backed into a corner and can as easily be discarded as a piece of paper. No one looks out for her, no one will save her...she has to be there for herself-at school, that is. Outside of school we get to see the love that her mother and her mother's boyfriend have for her, how they worry and would do anything for her. It's not simply a case of blind parenting-they do their best to figure out what's going on and they don't clam up. They continually ask her why she's acting this way, why she is running off, why she started a fight at school...it was heartwarming and broke my heart when they realized they couldn't do anything to help if she wasn't willing to open up. Because not only does everyone in the school hate Romy Grey....everyone in town despises her as well. \n\nWhy her?\nAnd finally there's Leon. The guy she works with. The guy who's above pettiness and high school games and wants to make a name for himself. The guy who would do almost anything for Romy...even after she rips his heart out time and again. He only has eyes for her, but he certainly doesn't take her bull shit. He tells her like it is and he makes her a better person. I loved their relationship and thought it was adorable watching a new romance bloom after the wake of a tragedy, watching the struggle to keep her 'good side.' Okay, I lied. I don't suppose it was adorable so much as uplifting....and heartbreaking. My soul was ripped in two more than once, longing for the perfect relationship, the perfect end to their (Romy's) tremulous journey. But that's Summers and she doesn't sugar coat life. Things happen. It's how you handle life's hurdles that makes you who you are. If you can't get past it? That's your own hang up. And that's what we get to see. I don't believe in forgiveness. I think if you hurt someone, it becomes a part of you both. Each of you just has to live with it and the person you hurt gets to decide if they want to give you the chance to do it again.Suited in her battle armor to take on any day and each new event in life, I loved Romy to bits. She was fierce, determined, but fractured into pieces and unable to feel complete and like a real, whole person. Her 'come and get me' red nails and lipstick were a farce for what she really feels on the inside: dull, lifeless, and hurt. Watching her fight her internal battles and take on one snobby bitch or asshole at a time, whenever she felt like it, we saw the fight that has long since extinguished since 'that night.' I hope everyone can find something to love about this story, because I was undeniably hooked and wanted nothing more than to read about Romy's happy ending. I hope you will, too. ...how do you get a girl to stop crying?You cover her mouth.*whines* And Courtneyyyyyy.....release another boooook....pleasseeeeee.For more of my reviews, please visit:\n \n\n\n \n\n******************************AGHHH!!!!

Both of these things make me\u00a0very mad, having seen people actually blame victims of rape for what happened to them, and this book did just that.

It's alright to be angry. It's alright to cry. Because when you have reached that point, that's when you realize the injustice of it all - you are moved so much by their plight that you cannot muster anything but tears and compassion for them.\u00a0And\u00a0All the Rage definitely makes all this more than just a statistic to people who feel this problem is far away from them, because of the honest, angry, and genuine way it was written, portraying this awful reality in the rawest way possible. You'd think that by 2015 we'd have evolved from the primitives we were, but we have not, andthis book really makes you see all the hardships, all the mental and psychological and emotional torture victims of rape and victim-blaming go through.\u00a0And my fucking god, does it hurt a lot. No book has made me this angry for a character before. All I wanted to do magically transport myself inside and teach the people in this small town a lesson on humility and compassion, and rescue Romy from their clutches.I really don't have anything else to say than that. I don't want to talk about it too much because this is a book that demands to be read and felt without any hint of spoilers whatsoever. It is very emotional and engaging in the realest way possible. The only other time I've read such an honest, genuine narration was when I read Andrea Portes'\u00a0Anatomy of a Misfit,\u00a0so trust me on this that it Romy's voice and experience will gut you, pierce you, pull your heartstrings, empty your tearducts, and make your nerves pop out in anger.This is my second\u00a0Courtney Summers book, and you bet I'm not going to be stopping anytime soon."}, {"userName": "Arianna\u2726\u274bSteamyReadsBlog\u274b\u2726", "userReviewDate": "Apr 10, 2015", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/23370948-arianna-steamyreadsblog", "userReview": "4.5 Stars!!\n\n\u201cYou know all the ways you can kill a girl?God, there are so many.\u201d\n\nThis book is about life and how hard is nowadays to be a teenage girl, about society and last, but not least about rape and how survivors of rape are struggling to move on, to accept they deserved more, to accept they are more than a victim. Like many realistic fiction novels this is a read you are not supposed to enjoy. It supposed to open your eyes, to make you realize how society really is, how is easier to believe that someone is lying than believe that someone\u2019s innocence was stolen. It goes without saying this novel felt REAL. The message of the story and the main character, Romy will certainly make you feel. Now\u2026]..if I\u2019m honest here I have to say this book made me so, so angry. Of course I knew before that life and our society are not perfect. And of course I knew people can be \u2018ugly\u2019 (inside), but to be reminded so often of these realities is gut-wrenching every damn time. \u201cAll the Rage\u201d is a book that will make you think, that will open your eyes and that will make you FEEL. Now...imagine you have been raped. No one believes you, because your rapist is \u2018someone important\u2019 and his family is an influential family in your community. On top of that, you are bullied because you were brave enough to speak out against rape, you are bullied because THEY think you don\u2019t have the right to live (no like them) because you are a 'LIAR', because you are just a girl who 'wants attention'. How can you move on from something like that? How can you learn again how to act, think, feel and trust after everything was stolen from you \u2013 your right to choose, your innocence, your voice.Romy Grey is a 17 years old who knows what is like to be seen like a liar, a girl who lost her friends and not only, just because she \u2018dared\u2019 to speak the truth. Romy was raped. She\u2019s damaged, but she\u2019s not totally broken, not like she thinks she is. To read her story was truly heart breaking. The author did a fantastic job portraying her character and her inner turmoil. Romy\u2019s voice was honest, raw and REAL. She has people in her life that really care for her, people that loves her and believes her \u2013 her mother, her mother\u2019s boyfriend and a boy, Leon who works with her. Leon represents the light in Romy\u2019s life. I really liked him and I liked how determined he was to do something good for the girl he likes. Not to save her, no, because Romy is the only one who can save herself, but to do something...anything to bring some happiness in her life.I have to say I really liked the ending. It\u2019s exactly how is supposed to be - full of hope. This was my first read by this author and I\u2019m certain it won\u2019t be my last. I really liked Courtney Summers\u2019s \u2018voice\u2019 and her writing style \u2013 simple, yet powerful.

For such an important thing to discuss, the subject of rape wasn't ever really talked about, which I found troubling. There were a couple of passing mentions of the word, but mainly in the context of Romy's classmates teasing her, and I feel like she never really came to terms with what happened to her. It would have been nice to get a bit more resolution on that front.I also wasn't expecting the book to take the turn that it did, and it ended up being more of a mystery novel than anything, which I found interesting. It evoked many emotions in me, and I nearly cried at one point. The story itself was very powerful emotionally, but there were too many open ends, and characters that could have been more fleshed out. As a reader, I like to get the whole picture of what I'm reading, at least by the end of the book. We were given little snippets of Romy's past, but they only lasted for a page or two, and didn't really give me much to go on. I still felt like I was in the dark about some important plot points, and the explanations were a bit too foggy for me to be satisfied. I also felt like the ending came WAY too suddenly, and this book could have benefited from a more structured conclusion.However, the book was still pretty enjoyable overall, which is why it got 3.5/5 stars from me."}, {"userName": "shady boots | #20gayteen", "userReviewDate": "Jan 27, 2015", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/4972138-shady-boots-20gayteen", "userReview": "Okay, how do I even begin to describe how this book made me feel.Contemporary YA has been heading in the right direction lately. I've mentioned before that I didn't like the quirky, whimsical bullshit that most YA contemp was doing. I want my YA contemp to be realistic as hell, cause it's supposed to be contemporary. In our world, in our time, tackling real world issues and dilemmas.But this book, I realized, was somehow too realistic, at least for me. Painfully realistic. I felt sick and uneasy and heartbroken throughout the entire thing, because this shit actually happens to girls. The wrong people are given power 85% of the time and it sucks. It fucking sucks.Just... if any of you are going through something like this, there ARE people who will trust you and stand by you. Don't make other people's disbelief put a plug on your ability to speak up. Hell, talk to ME, even. I wouldn't really be able to help much, but I'd be there as a friend.

This particular topic is also tackled in that game with the main character's friend, and your actions in the game could literally determine if you could save her from killing herself. This is exactly what I was talking about when I said there will be people who will stand by you and care for you in this situation, because as you play Max, you'll be able to stand by Kate--the victim in question--since everyone else seems to be against her, and even save her life.I strongly suggest you guys to play it because it tackles many issues like this. Even if you guys aren't necessarily gamers, I still think you'd enjoy it.

After finishing it, I was in such a funk that my husband asked me if something terrible had happened that day. I proceeded to tell him all about the amazing, powerful book I had just finished. To which he said, \u201cWHY would you want to read that?\u201d There are so many reasons why (starting with because I love reality and ending with I don\u2019t want my literature to coddle me). But the main reason why I recommend this book for everyone is that I think that this book is truth. It\u2019s hard, sharp, uncomfortable truth, but it needs to be heard. This book is like bitter medicine for all the easy, comforting lies we tell ourselves. Lies like:She really shouldn\u2019t dress like that.Some girls are just asking for it.She led him on.She wanted it, really.Why else would she have been at a frat party at night? And drunk?These words are easy because they shift the blame. They shift it away from the large, scary, out of control attacker and onto the small, broken victim. They give us all the illusion that rape is something that we can control, if only we act, think, speak, dress, and comport ourselves in a certain way. And if a girl gets raped, it\u2019s so easy to blame her, to think that she could have prevented it. If it\u2019s true that there\u2019s no possible way she could have prevented it, if it\u2019s true that it can happen to anyone, anywhere, regardless of age, race, or class \u2013 then where does that leave us? It leaves us all as potential victims. And it leaves us in the difficult situation of having to question why this problem is so prevalent in our society. Why are so many girls (and boys) raped? And (here\u2019s the truly scary question) why does our society produce so many rapists? How did we get to the place where our response to a gang rape at a fraternity house is to ask all women not to attend fraternity parties?This book deals with all of this, but it is never an \u201cissue\u201d book and it never feels didactic. Rather, it is a chilling, immersive first person account of a girl who experiences rape and everything that happens in the after. Like everything Courtney Summers writes, it is masterfully crafted. She weaves together the before and the after, deftly showing us that although the rape itself is over, Romy is still living it every single day. Unlike every other first person rape account I have read (Speak and Raw Blue come to mind), this one acknowledges that anger is an acceptable part of a rape victim\u2019s emotional array \u2013 not just anger, but blinding, murderous rage. This book is also impressively plotted. It is not only a slow-building, emotional account, but also a suspenseful mystery with a truly creepy twist. I loved every sickening minute of it."}, {"userName": "Vane J.", "userReviewDate": "Oct 07, 2014", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/19590155-vane-j", "userReview": "You know all the ways you can kill a girl?God, there are so many.\nRomy's had a difficult life.

It's called All the Rage, by Courtney Summers. More information about it can be found by clicking on the cover image above. Yeah, you should totally read it.Yes, it is a brutal look at rape culture in today's society. Yes, it draws our attentions to things most of us would rather not think about. Yes, it is dark, disturbing, able to burrow into the most hidden recesses of your mind and stay there long after you put it down. But it is such an important story, one that has needed to be told.Not only is it thematically important, but it is of such high quality. Summers's prose is crackling and vibrant: the story will draw you in, and the writing will keep you hooked. Romy may not be the most likable character in all of young adult literature, but she is a realistic look at the effect of trauma on human behavior. Some of her reactions are unreasonable, some of her choices irrational, but it just makes her story that much more heartbreaking.This book has been boiling inside of Courtney Summers for years.

You won't regret the experience."}, {"userName": "Rose", "userReviewDate": "Jul 14, 2012", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/3399699-rose", "userReview": "Initial reaction: Review to come when I can pick my heart up off the ground. I was expecting an emotional read, and I got one. I felt so sorry for Romy's experiences, and her voice is raw, honest, and heartbreaking. I still feel like there were some threads in the story that weren't completely tied (which is why I'm giving this 4 stars instead of 5), but I really appreciated the read. It was beautifully written.Also, thank goodness for an awesome POC love interest. I really liked Leon a lot.Full review:I'll admit it took me the longest time to reflect on this book because it hit home on a lot of things for me, particularly when it comes to discussions of sexual violence and how society at large treats young women and women in general when it comes sexual shaming. Courtney Summers has a way of gripping you in the measure of a teen's emotions and bringing their thoughts so intimately that it feels you're following right in their footsteps, which is why I end up loving many of her respective novels. There's always a strong sense of voice, emotion, and theme in each of Summers's novels.Romy is a young woman in a lot of pain. She's raped by the son of a prominent figure in her neighborhood, accused of lying, slammed and shunned by her community. She attempts to find some space to escape, working at a diner and finding a friend who makes her feel like she can *feel* something again (Leon, who is so awesome of a love interest and support that I wish more teen guys could be portrayed like him. Plus, he's a POC!) But when a person from her past comes up with a bit of information that shakes her, let alone seems to disappear without a trace, Romy has to figure out what she should do in the aftermath.This book seems to focus more on the overarching mystery/disappearance (which is intriguing and kept me guessing through the narrative), but there are some very true commentaries on sexual shaming/violence that stayed with me long after I finished \"All the Rage\". I wish the narrative could've expounded upon Romy's experience with the sheriff's son and how that came to pass, and I also wish that the ending of the novel could've felt a little more complete (then again, I think I've had this issue with some of Summers' other novels for endings, such as \"Cracked Up to Be\". It may just be a matter of preference). Even with that consideration, this book had me completely and emotionally invested. There were points where it did hit me emotionally, especially seeing what Romy goes through in terms of the bullying, and how she grapples with her own inner anger over her experience, the people who alienated her, her distrust, and wanting to hold onto that which makes her even the least bit happy (though she finds herself pushing away Leon in unfair ways because of her distrust).The emotions were palpable and scenario very realistic, almost so much that I only put the book down when it hit so close to home, it left me trying to grapple with my own emotions and experiences. If it's something to say, I don't think I know any woman who hasn't had some unwelcome sexual advance or encounter, or hasn't been the victim of shaming in some sexual way. I can even name my own painful experiences, and I've talked about them in some capacities in the past in other discussions, though they weren't easy conversations to have.If there's something to say, \"All the Rage\" is a novel that is an important part of a much larger conversation that should be open and encouraged, especially among young women. I think that'd be a huge stepping stone to eradicate the kind of cruelties of action and dialogue that Romy endures through this book.Overall score: 4/5 stars"}, {"userName": "Kelly", "userReviewDate": "Feb 06, 2012", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/732347-kelly", "userReview": "All the Rage is an incredible, authentic, painful book that looks deep into what rape culture is and how rape culture impacts the lives of girls. Romy embodies what it means to have everything that\u2019s yours taken from you, and she fights back tooth and nail to regain not just a shred of herself but she fights back to ensure that other girls don\u2019t have to endure what she has. That being made to be \u201cless than\u201d because of someone else\u2019s actions isn\u2019t OKAY. This book is important, and it needs to be on your radar if you care about feminism, about rape culture, about girls and the way girls become victimized over and over again, especially when they\u2019re already a victim. It\u2019s about standing up when you know you are going to be knocked down again. It\u2019s a book about girls taking back what is rightfully theirs: the voices, their bodies, their place in society as humans. Summers creates dynamic characters across the spectrum here, and without doubt, Romy is my favorite character she's written. Leon, one of the secondary characters, might be a close second to Romy, though. I also found myself really invested in Romy's mother in this story -- there was one part, in fact, where her mother made me cry with something she said to Romy. It hit one of those few soft spots I've got. Every character here is round, flawed, and compelling. Even the characters who filled me with rage and hate had me caring enough about them to allow those feelings to come up, hard, each time they returned. The mystery is well-rendered, and the who-done-it element of this story never overpowers the greater story nor does it fall to the wayside. This isn't a book with a message, but the implications of what it is like to be a girl in a world that regularly chews them up and spits them up come through clearly in Romy and the entire diverse cast of characters. I\u2019ll say a lot more about All the Rage when it\u2019s closer to release date, but if I had to give this a \u201cmeets,\u201d it is spot on Laurie Halse Anderson\u2019s Speak meets Veronica Mars. This is Summers's best work, hands down, and her writing cuts straight to the bone. It's not friendly and it's not supposed to be.

Sure, the story is told through the eyes of a very angry and depressed teenager, but it's undeniable that slut-shaming, victim-shaming, rape culture, are still issues that are predominantly ignored. I won't get into the dirty because more discerning readers have better articulated these in their reviews. Plus, talking about these issues just infuriate me incoherent, and I do not have ice cream or chocolate in the house today, so better not. Not today at least.What I like best about this book is how authentic Romy feels. I wanted to hug or smack her alternately. It's hard being a girl, doubly so being a teenage girl and infinitely so being a teenage girl who is considered a pariah in Douche County, USA. All The Rage is a beautifully ugly, compelling book. That blurb though is quite misleading because you'd expect that Kellan Turner to actually be in the story.
