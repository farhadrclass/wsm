Scott Fitzgerald wrote for various publications that the editor James L. W. West put together showing his memoir writing. What's fascinating to me was that Fitzgerald was extremely famous at the time of these articles - so he conveys himself as a character that the public already knows about. In a sense he's a performer in his own writing.Some pieces are better then others but still all of them are interesting. All you get is really a snapshot but filtered through Fitzgerald's sense of style. I think he was an amazing writer."}, {"userName": "Michael", "userReviewDate": "Mar 10, 2012", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/88295-michael", "userReview": "Mostly worthless. A bit of a Fitzgerald yard sale, this loosely thematic collection gathers together 19 ostensibly autobiographical pieces. I say \"loosely\" because most were written for a quick buck when FSF needed to pay the bills, so that the lion's share of the pieces (\"essays\" is too lofty a term for these sketches) read like throwaway of-the-moment glosses on, say, modern \"girls\" (tellingly not \"women\"). Thick with name checks and given to a self-indulgently chatty tone that has worn very badly, a reader would be hard pressed to see the real writer in this collection.If not, that is, for a few glimmers of greatness in the dross. In the first hundred pages are the amusing (though also faintly appalling) \"How to Live on $36,000 a Year\" and its follow-up, \"How to Live on Practically Nothing a Year,\" written in FSF's youth and both of which are worthwhile. But it is in the last fifty or so pages, when FSF is older and a bit disillusioned, that the best pieces lie. These final half-dozen pieces are more carefully written and perhaps as a result, touching. \"An Author's Mother\" is a deftly empathetic imagining of his mother's last hours that, by never directly addressing his grief, captures it all the better; and \"Author's House,\" \"Afternoon of an Author,\" and \"A Hundred False Starts\" all show us a writer prematurely in his twilight years, struggling to find something to say. The melancholy of these later pieces, like that in FSF's \"The Crack-Up,\" are a sharp reminder of just how good he was. A pity he didn't live past forty-four, didn't get through these dark years to a place where he could write from a wiser perspective."}, {"userName": "Sierra Sitzes", "userReviewDate": "Aug 19, 2013", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/7630969-sierra-sitzes", "userReview": "I picked up my copy of this book at the infamous Shakespeare and Company in Paris this summer. I figured, being at one of the Lost Generation's creative epicenters, I might as well buy a book about the writers rather than the novels themselves. (Plus, I own most of Fitzgerald's work anyway.) I expected to gain a better understanding of Fitzgerald, his generation, and the thought behind his writing. I did not expect the impact this collection of essays would have on my own awareness as a writer. Fitzgerald's insight into his generation and the change between its predecessor and its successor is impressive. He writes with the wisdom of a man who observed much more than the forty-four years he was alive. His essays are impregnated with profound ideas and common sense without being pretentious. Consistently, there are references to politicians/socialites/actors of the time, but this edition contains a helpful appendix.A must read for any fan of the time after the Great War, the Lost Generation, or early twentieth century americana."}, {"userName": "Dee", "userReviewDate": "Jun 03, 2014", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/23699961-dee", "userReview": "This book consisted of several short stories and essays which Fitzgerald had written during his career.

Scott Fitzgerald\u2019s non-fiction writings are not as famous as his novels and short stories, but they contain some superb pieces that shed light on the life of this fascinating author. One reason that might explain why Fitzgerald\u2019s non-fiction writings are less well-known is that they have been scattered all over the place. It would be wonderful to have one volume that collected all of his major non-fiction pieces in one place. A Short Autobiography, edited by Fitzgerald scholar James L.W. West III, was issued in 2011 with the aim of collecting Fitzgerald\u2019s non-fiction works that reveal more of his personal life. Unfortunately, A Short Autobiography doesn\u2019t include any of the \u201cCrack-Up\u201d essays, but it does have many other excellent pieces.Another issue with Fitzgerald\u2019s non-fiction is that some of the pieces are hard to categorize. Is \u201cAn Author\u2019s Mother\u201d fiction or non-fiction? It\u2019s been published in collections of Fitzgerald\u2019s fiction, but it also appears in A Short Autobiography. There\u2019s obviously some fiction in it, as the name of the author in the piece is not F. Scott Fitzgerald, and unlike the author in the piece, Fitzgerald didn\u2019t have a brother. However, the piece does seem to be a pretty accurate portrait of Fitzgerald\u2019s mother, Mollie McQuillan Fitzgerald. Fitzgerald was constantly borrowing from his own life to inform his fiction, and the line between the two is often blurred. In the very first line of the first piece in A Short Autobiography, \u201cWho\u2019s Who-and Why,\u201d from 1920, Fitzgerald writes: \u201cThe history of my life is the history of the struggle between an overwhelming urge to write and a combination of circumstances bent on keeping me from it.\u201d (p.1) Little did he know how true this would be throughout the rest of his short life. There were always parties, and alcohol, and many other distractions for Scott that would keep him from his work. However, that being said, he was still very prolific despite all the distractions, turning out roughly 180 short stories, four completed novels and one unfinished novel in his forty-four years. In \u201cPrinceton,\u201d an affectionate look at the university Fitzgerald attended, (and didn\u2019t graduate from) he mentions that 5% of his class at Princeton were killed in World War I. That\u2019s a staggering fact that makes clear what a large impact the war had on Fitzgerald\u2019s generation. One of the pieces that showcases Fitzgerald\u2019s sense of humor is \u201cSalesmanship in the Champs-Elysees,\u201d which is written in the voice of a French car salesman. For me, one of the highlights of A Short Autobiography was hearing Fitzgerald\u2019s authorial voice in a more personal way.In \u201cOne Hundred False Starts,\u201d an essay from 1933 in which Fitzgerald detailed the many ideas for stories he had that never panned out, he wrote: \u201cThere is the question of dog stories. I like dogs and would like to write at least one dog story in the style of Mr. Terhune.\u201d (p.126) Two years later, Fitzgerald finally did write his dog story, \u201cShaggy\u2019s Morning,\u201d an odd account of a day in the life of a dog, written from the dog\u2019s perspective. It was an interesting experiment, although perhaps not entirely successful. \u201cShaggy\u2019s Morning\u201d is one of the few Fitzgerald stories to be published during his lifetime that has never been collected in a book. In \u201cAuthor\u2019s House,\u201d another essay written for Esquire in 1936, Fitzgerald wrote: \u201cA writer\u2019s temperament is continually making him do things he can never repair.\u201d (p.139) This was certainly true in Fitzgerald\u2019s case, as he wore out his welcome with friends again and again through his drunken behavior. One of the most beautiful pieces in the book is \u201cThe Death of My Father,\u201d which Fitzgerald wrote after his father\u2019s passing in 1931. He never finished it, and it was first published in 1951 in The Princeton University Literary Chronicle. It\u2019s a short piece, only three pages long, but it paints a vivid picture of Scott\u2019s relationship with his father Edward. In it, Fitzgerald wrote: \u201cI loved my father\u2014always deep in my subconscious I have referred judgements back to him, to what he would have thought or done. He loved me\u2014and felt a deep responsibility for me\u2014I was born several months after the sudden death of my two elder sisters and he felt what the effect of this would be on my mother, that he would be my only moral guide. He became that to the best of his ability. He came from tired old stock with very little left of vitality and mental energy but he managed to raise a little for me.\u201d (p.118) This passage was repeated almost word for word in Tender is the Night, when Dick Diver learns of his father\u2019s death: \u201cDick loved his father\u2014again and again he referred judgements to what his father would probably have thought or done. Dick was born several months after the death of two young sisters and his father, guessing what would be the effect on Dick\u2019s mother, had saved him from a spoiling by becoming his moral guide. He was of tired stock yet he raised himself to that effort.\u201d (Tender is the Night, p.203) A Short Autobiography reveals parts of Fitzgerald that we don\u2019t often get to see in his fiction. For this reason, it\u2019s an essential read for fans of Fitzgerald\u2019s writing."}, {"userName": "Sir\u00e8ne", "userReviewDate": "Mar 17, 2017", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/6691242-sir-ne", "userReview": "Before I start this review, allow me to make a note that I have been completely in love Fitzgerald's work since I was 15. I have an extensive collection of Fitzgerald, from his novels to nearly every short story he has written. In addition, I was happy to find this book which has a compilation of news articles and columns he's written throughout his career. The beginning of the book had me completely in awe and starstruck because it was different from anything I have read from him. It was personal and intimate. I thoroughly enjoyed having the chance to glimpse inside the mind of the man who's writing encompassed the jazz age. The articles that stood out the most to me was How to Live on Practically Nothing a Year and \"Wait Till You Have Children of Your Own!\"All my biases aside, the writing falls weak and choppy from page 92 throughout the end. I was disappointed because halfway throughout the book it was obvious he was only writing because he needed the money. It is understandable considering how he talks about how often he and Zelda found themselves overspending and back to where they started in a situation where they ran out of money. Overall, I found myself underwhelmed and often times bored. The philosophical arguments and tangents are what keeps the rating of this book neutral for me because it was refreshing to know how progressive he was at such a conservative time period. I believe the book would have been great if it stayed consistent with a theme and left out the boring content he wrote solely to get out of debt."}, {"userName": "Erin Quinney", "userReviewDate": "Mar 26, 2018", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/4269160-erin-quinney", "userReview": "\"Autobiography\" is a bit of a misnomer, but these essays do paint a picture of the man, if only a particularly blurry one.

Now James L.W. West III, Edwin Erle Sparks Professor of English at Pennsylvania State University, has gathered 19 personal essays written from 1920 to 1940 and arranged them chronologically to disclose Fitzgerald\u2019s life story. From \u2018What I Think and Feel at 25\u2032 to \u2018One Hundred False Starts,\u2019 these essays would seem to serve as an intellectual autobiography and should inspire Fitzgerald readers new or returning.\u201dThat Library Journal \u201cpre-pub alert\u201d piqued my curiosity in A Short Autobiography. With the blessing of my editor at The Writer, I requested a review copy. I expected to fall truly, madly and deeply in love with the book. I am left in a somewhat less passionate, but still positive, state.Don\u2019t get me wrong: The Library Journal summary is correct, as far as it goes. But it fails to mention a salient point, tucked between the book\u2019s preface (an essential introduction \u2013 do not skip it) and the first essay: \u201cThe texts for fifteen of the nineteen items in this collection are taken from My Lost City: Personal Essays, 1920-1940, a volume in the Cambridge Edition of the Works of F. Scott Fitzgerald published in 2005 by Cambridge University Press.\u201d In other words, serious Fitzgerald aficionados may have encountered most of the essays in this book already.But for the garden-variety fans among us, the book offers a compact and intriguing reminder of Fitzgerald\u2019s all-too-short life. Editor West is correct when he observes that Fitzgerald \u201cwrote about himself with insight and humor, adopting poses and reinventing himself as the occasion required.\u201d Readers who write are likely to pick up a few ideas about style and structure for their own future use.Moreover, A Short Autobiography*provides some tantalizing tidbits regarding Fitzgerald\u2019s own writing and publishing history. The book\u2019s first two texts \u2013 \u201cWho\u2019s Who \u2013 and Why\u201d and \u201cAn Interview with Mr. Fitzgerald by F. Scott Fitzgerald\u201d \u2013 date from 1920, the year when Fitzgerald\u2019s first novel, This Side of Paradise, was published. Here is the opening sentence of the former essay: \u201cThe history of my life is the history of the struggle between an overwhelming urge to write and a combination of circumstances bent on keeping me from it.\u201d The rest of the piece chronicles the rejections and obstacles that this lionized author encountered on his way to first-book publication.Thirteen years later, Fitzgerald published an essay titled \u201cOne Hundred False Starts.\u201d This too is a must-read for other writers. Filled with confessions (\u201cYet even now when, at the recurrent cry of \u2018Baby Needs Shoes,\u2019 I sit down facing my sharpened pencils and block of legal-sized paper, I have a feeling of utter helplessness.\u201d) and observations (\u201cMostly we authors must repeat ourselves\u2014that\u2019s the truth.\u201d), this essay merits reading \u2013 and rereading.Apparently, Fitzgerald sought to publish a book very much like this one during his lifetime.

For instance, one can see a stark difference between the man wrote \"An Interview with Mr. Fitzgerald by F. Scott Fitzgerald\" and the one who authored \"Author's House.\" The former was written shortly after the success of Fitzgerald's first novel and was bright-eyed and self-indulgent; in contrast, the latter looked back on a life filled with failure and disappointment but also looking ahead with humility and wonder.Many of the essays do smack of Fitzgerald's attempt to make a living through their wide array of topics and chatty narrative, but one sees some glimmers of his life, especially through essays like \"How to Live on $36,000 a Year\" and \"How to live on Practically Nothing a Year.\" One thing is made clear through it all, though: he was sharply observant about his generation and their search for identity in between the world's two greatest wars.
