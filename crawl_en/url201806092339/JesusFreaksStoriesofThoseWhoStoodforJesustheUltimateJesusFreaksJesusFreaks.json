This book is more than a book. Not the Bible, but once you pray before you read it, an emotion overtakes you at the realization that this is it. I rarely feel chills or get the sudden urge to do something outrageous for God, but this book pushed me on. Not to just dive in and die, but everything. This book is a blessing. Although it was written in 1997, it feels like it was in today. So many stories impacted me. The way I think and view things. Made me realize how much of a selfish human being I am. This book made me want nothing more that to pick up my heavy cross, and follow Jesus for the rest of my life. I couldn't stop talking to people about it. I would read stories in my class. For morning worship. I'd stay up late and...in all honesty... not want this book to end. But it has come to an end. And I can only pray with all of my soul...that my name will be the next in that book. I am Peter. A broken soul, one who is not perfect. One who curses, who gets angered easily. He who was the worse of the twelve. I am just like Peter. But then there is hope for those such as me, which lets me know that through God all is possible. I never want this fire within me to go out. I want it to burn bright, consuming all in its path. I am 16 years old, and I am a Jesus Freak."}, {"userName": "Kate", "userReviewDate": "Nov 15, 2011", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/6159615-kate", "userReview": "For a while I wouldn\u2019t read \u201cJesus Freaks\u201d because I thought it would be too depressing. A book about people being tortured and killed for their faith isn\u2019t really my cup of tea. Then one day, I sat down in an aisle in Barnes and Noble and started reading it. It was hard to read, it scared me at times, but it wasn\u2019t depressing. In fact, I was finding it uplifting and humbling. I was dumbfounded. But the more I read, the more I began to realize why I found it so uplifting. This book does an amazing job of not victimizing the Martyrs. As a reader, instead of pitying the Martyrs I found myself respecting them. I respected the strength of their faith and their victories over the enemy inspired me. This book isn\u2019t an easy read. It\u2019s gruesome at times, the authors do not tip toe around the situations faced. They provide true accounts of everyday Christians risking their lives to stand up for what they believe in. The book consists of stories of men and women all over the world who refused to forsake Jesus, even in the face of death. However, the tone of the book is one of encouragement, which is amazing since the subject appears to be so dark. \u201cJesus Freaks\u201d is almost like an anthology of short stories, each story is written in narrative structure and introduces one of the Martyrs and recounts their story in a compelling way. There are also powerful quotes throughout the book by Pastors, missionaries, and theologians that illustrate the following stories. I commend the author\u2019s mission to raise awareness about religious persecution and to also show the courage that the Lord is giving these people. As one of the authors, Toby McKeehan writes about the Martyrs \"these are the people who are changing our world by refusing to lay aside their relationship with Jesus for the mere sake of being accepted by the crowd\" (Mckeehan 6). Not only is this book an inspiring read, but it is also informative about the religious oppression and revolutions going on around the world. I strongly recommend it."}, {"userName": "Timothy", "userReviewDate": "Mar 09, 2012", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/7788640-timothy", "userReview": "[That is the story of a man who was killed for translating the New Testament of the Bible to English.

As we go through the Bible I like to pick up various devotions that are Bible based, but inspirational or fun to read afterward, as we consider the Word being applied where the rubber meets the road.One section a night takes about a 100 nights. As there are nearly that many mini 3 pages bio's of those who have gone before us.This one has been great for that purpose speaking to the hearts of children, youth, adult alike.Reminding us of our real call and walk is not being about ourselves, but as Luke 9:23 calls us to. To Deny ourselves, Due to self, and Follow Jesus. What a grand adventure that is! So many times we think dying sacrificing our lives for the gospel sake is the ultimate. Sometimes it is. But Ohhh to be a living sacrifice for a lifetime (Romans 12:1-2) What a call that is. So pick up this book and may it encourage you to be in Thee Book living for Jesus.

I say that before some nut begins to compare the two. Foxe's book is a genuine classic that should be required reading. This is a very good book that deals with the death of (mostly) modern day Christians. I will warn you that if you read this book you will feel small. Most of today's Christian complain about the price of gas and milk and talk about what great tribulation they go through at work because the boss expects them to do their jobs. Jesus Freaks talks about those who have been imprisoned, tortured and killed because of what they believe. They gladly went to the grave holding on to their belief in Christ. If all Christians had that kind of faith the world would have already been converted. Every one ought to check this book out, it is an easy read but it speaks volumes to the heart."}, {"userName": "Jeff Williams", "userReviewDate": "May 11, 2011", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/5402244-jeff-williams", "userReview": "This book will challenge your Christian walk. At the time in my life I read it, I was going through a really difficult, post-adolescent time and it woke me up. Whatever I was going through, I wasn't a martyr, I just had a rough time. I could be going through much worse for much less. It inspired me to be a stronger, better Christian. It spurred me towards seeking God's calling for my life, and being obedient to answering that calling. Highly recommend this book to teenagers, college age kids, young adults, middle-age adults, old adults.

It states it is geared towards teens and I did have my teenager read it as required reading after I read it. This is a phenomenal book I think all believers should read. The stories are true,gripping you from page one. The stories are short but powerful. The book tells about courageous men and women of all ages who took a stand for Christ from around the world. The courage these brothers and sisters displayed was nothing short of remarkable. They gave their lives for Christ! This is happening today! Jesus was not kidding when he said \u201cIf the world hates you, know that it has hated me before it hated you. If you were of the world, the world would love you as its own; but because you are not of the world, but I chose you out of the world, therefore the world hates you\" (John 15:18-19) At first I thought this book may be a bit depressing due to the torture/killing of these courageous souls...however it had just the opposite effect. The stories are uplifting and strengthened my faith deeply. I'm looking forward to reading the second book soon...."}, {"userName": "Lynne", "userReviewDate": "Oct 19, 2010", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/4433258-lynne", "userReview": "This book is often marketed to young adults, but I think that's more because older adults often give up a lot of the zeal for God that comes with youth. It's just too easy for us (especially in the well-off, consumerist west) to forget or blow off any idea that there really are times when we might have to literally give up everything - our family, our religious community, or home, even our life - because someone more powerful than us demands it. This book is a collection of short (1-2 page) stories, letters, and so on, each providing a glimpse into a life-event of someone who had to make a hard choice to stand for Jesus no matter what. Reading these stories is meant to inspire and teach us from the examples of others who did it right by hanging on to Jesus and Jesus alone, through even the hardest trial of their lives. The only thing I do not like about the book is the feathered pages. Sure, it's pretty and \"cool\" looking, but it makes it a real pain to turn pages as you're reading."}, {"userName": "Eric", "userReviewDate": "Feb 26, 2011", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/5042947-eric", "userReview": "I stopped reading this book pretty early on. It seems like it was primarily written for 15-year-olds, which is, by no coincidence, how old I was when it was published. I'm sure that it was marketed to 15 year old me and some part of my brain put it down as, \"You should probably read this book some day.\"But don't read it when you're 30 and more cynical than your 15 year old self.That said, stories of people standing up for what they believe in can be encouraging. What is less encouraging is the attitude that everybody who is not a Christian must be some terrorist, bent on destroying Christianity. Just because someone is a Muslim or a Communist doesn't make them anti-Christian. The \"Us Vs. Them\" attitude of this book turned me away early on.This review is from my blog: http://mrsundquist.blogspot.com/2013/..."}, {"userName": "Liz", "userReviewDate": "May 04, 2013", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/4565708-liz", "userReview": "Jesus Freaks is a collection of 1-2 page, very short, biographies of Christian martyrs throughout history. For what it is, it's decent. It's certainly not an in-depth look at each person's life; usually each story focuses on the events immediately leading to the person's death. If you are looking to get a broad understanding of Christian martyrdom throughout history without much detail, this is a good read. Many of the older stories are from Foxe's Book of Martyrs. The book is printed in conjunction with Voice of the Martyrs, so it has a tinge of their agenda, too."}, {"userName": "Wilier", "userReviewDate": "Feb 26, 2017", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/59044847-wilier", "userReview": "\u00bfEstamos viviendo una \u00e9poca de tolerancia?La respuesta es no.Este es mi libro de no ficci\u00f3n favorito.

The book presents the stories in little snapshots of the moments when these people stood up for Jesus even in the face of death or torture. Some of the stories have the potential to be very moving, and I would highly recommend it to anyone who is unfamiliar with the sheer heroism and love for God that martyrdom portrays.However, the language is dumbed-down and the stories lack the background of the person who gives up their life for God. In the end, I think I'd rather read the biography of just one person than the snapshot of the one moment of martyrdom simply because it helps you to understand why they made that choice and all the good they'd done (\"white\" martyrdom) leading up to it.

The cover and book design is terrific! That initially drew me to the book. There are wonderful quotes posted here and there that I copied down in my journal. I enjoyed finding out about people that I hadn't heard of before, which leads me to my main problem with the book. Most of the stories were very limited in details other than the grotesque torture and executions that these people endured. I would have liked to know more about the individual's beliefs and what exactly they were taking a stand on. Some stories did get into that info, but most did not. I was especially curious about the people tortured and executed by the Church of England. It did lead me to do research on the people in question. I also noticed that some of the stories were made more interesting with details that were most likely made up. Some stories were more myth in which no one really knows what happened. The writing style was too simplistic and amateur for my taste. The back of the book contains a list of countries and a brief description of their stand against Christians. Since the book was written in the 90s, it is very interesting to research these countries to see where they stand now. I looked up the website for the non-profit to support martyrs and Christians who are persecuted around the world and it looks like they are still going strong.The book does good in showing how faith can withstand a great deal of pain by focusing on the Kingdom of Heaven. In America today, we rarely have to experience persecution. That's why you hear Americans complain that they are being persecuted when they pick up their coffee at Starbucks and it doesn't have a Christmas tree design on the side. I marvel at the Christians in this book who had scripture memorized because they weren't allowed to have a bible, but so many American Christians don't even read the many bibles they have lying around their homes.

It started getting hard to read when I got towards the end. The book is very factual is why I think I had so much trouble with it. I feel that I understand Christianity a lot from the way these people die and endure all the torture without a blink of an eye. I have a lot more respect of those who do missionary work.

Most start with them having to hide due to their faith otherwise known as religious persecution. The middle is the story on what happened to them that led them to their death. Most end with a sad explanation of how they were executed, but some have miraculous survival stories.One example of the good ending is a guy sent to be boiled alive in oil but God protected him then the king had him burned but he still managed to survive the flames. This shows that he believed in God and his God protected him. One with a bad ending is this guy who was arrested for his belief in Jesus Christ and was sentenced to be burned at the steak and was tied to it and was burned alive and the whole time until completely died he prayed."}, {"userName": "BG45", "userReviewDate": "Jun 26, 2017", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/45118942-bg45", "userReview": "I've read through this book three times in my life.

Would I, in a similar position be willing to die for my faith? That's not a question a young person should be asking themselves. The other two times I've read through the book, I've done so as a Catholic, and taken note of how biased some of the examples can be to appeal to an entirely Evangelical perspective, twisting some stories, if not outright seeming to change them.

In 1997, Perveen was killed for running away in order to avoid marrying a Muslim man; Anila was imprisoned for helping her friend escape. In an introduction to the book, Michael Tait explains its purpose: \"In a world built on free will instead of God's will, we must be the Freaks.
