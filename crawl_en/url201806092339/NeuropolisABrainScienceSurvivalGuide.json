As ever, he can't help himself when there's a joke lurking in the wings and this adds such a great dimension to this tour de force of popular science. But wouldn't another novel be good, Rob? It would, wouldn't it?Go on. Please."}, {"userName": "Sam", "userReviewDate": "May 31, 2017", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/8595498-sam", "userReview": "Superb. Funny, impassioned and wise. Skewers some big names for pseudo-science masquerading as neuroscience.

Can brain scans read our minds? \nBased on Rob Newman\u2019s live stand-up show and new BBC Radio 4 series, his thought-provoking new book explores the scientific breakthroughs that have turned received ideas of brain science upside down.\nAfter imagining volunteering for a brain-imaging experiment meant to locate the part of the brain that lights up when you\u2019re in love, comedian Robert Newman emerged with more questions than answers.In Neuropolis Newman argues that the current claim that the brain is just a complicated computer derives from science, but from a combination of philosophical stowaways and a version of evolutionary biology that owes little to Darwin. He questions why brain science is devoted to such a peculiarly reductionist world view, when really exciting advances in neuroscience go untold, such as awe-inspiring discoveries about the origins of memory in ancient oceans. He also shows that our brains are inextricably and profoundly intertwined with our bodies, the natural world and the world we have made, including hilarious accounts of his own participation in neurological experiments.Debunking the common, even brainless interpretations of brain science, he celebrates the more intriguing and underreported advances in neuroscience with zest and wit.", "title": "Neuropolis: A Brain Science Survival Guide", "url": "http://www.goodreads.com/book/show/34895875-neuropolis", "average": 3.68, "cover": "https://images.gr-assets.com/books/1492643194l/34895875.jpg", "reviews": 4, "authors": [{"url": "https://www.goodreads.com/author/show/559447.Robert_Newman", "name": "Robert Newman"}], "type": ["Science", "Cultural", "Nonfiction"], "outlinks": ["http://www.goodreads.com/book/show/34895875-neuropolis", "http://www.goodreads.com/book/show/33229426-neuropolis", "http://www.goodreads.com/book/show/1035795.The_Fountain_at_the_Center_of_the_World", "http://www.goodreads.com/book/show/1488252.Dependence_Day", "http://www.goodreads.com/book/show/3704239-manners", "http://www.goodreads.com/book/show/17339539-the-trade-secret", "http://www.goodreads.com/book/show/28120981-the-entirely-accurate-encyclopaedia-of-evolution"]}
