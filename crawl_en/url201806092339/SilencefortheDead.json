In 1919 England, at a lonely mansion where moors meet sea, 21 \"mad\" soldiers convalesce from WWI, suffering PTSD. But ghosts that reek of rot whisper sweet suicide in the patients' ears, inhibiting their recovery. To this bleak place comes Kitty Weeks, age 20-ish, masquerading as a nurse, fleeing her own murderous father. She's resilient and courageous, but not foolish. She knows something is wrong, and immediately recognizes the mysterious \"patient 16\" \u2014 incognito and hidden away. Soon they put their heads together. Crazy or not.Engrossing, this dark gothic suspense novel. Not totally predictable. Some plot twists. Not too grisly for me, and I'm squeamish. A happy ending for many characters. There's even a lovely bit of romance. Heartwarming in a few scenes, as the \"madmen\" bond against evil spirits and remember who they are.Quibble: The characterization of the hospital matron shifted midstream. What? Also, why couldn't the other nurses see the ghosts?Some reviewers felt it faltered in the second half. Not so for me. Maybe Wells' narration made the difference. Plus, in the second half we got some heartwarming soldierly scenes and some tender love scenes.4.5 stars!"}, {"userName": "Jessica Woodbury", "userReviewDate": "Sep 12, 2013", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/4271946-jessica-woodbury", "userReview": "This book started on track for 3 stars, basic but a nice quick read.

I was that impressed. I am quite fond of the early 20th Century period in a fictional setting, and this seems to be a particular area of interest for her as well. With this book, she focused on the troubled homefront of Post-WWI England, when veterans are coming back from the war damaged, both in body and in mind. Kitty Weekes is desperate for a job, desperate enough to take a job at Portis House, an isolated mental health facility for veterans. She lies about being a nurse, and she's caught in her lie, but the Matron allows her to keep the job anyway, as she's that desperate for another 'nurse'. Kitty soon realizes just how wrong things are at Portis House, but it's not like she has anywhere else to go.\"Silence for the Dead\" is Gothic fiction, and the author does choose a fearsome setting in a haunted mental hospital. Unfortunately, this book lacked the degree of authentic and effective atmosphere that this story cried out for. I expected to be really unsettled by this story, considering its setting in an asylum with a troubled history as a family home whose family disappeared under decidedly strange circumstances. It seems to suggest some very powerful emotions of fear of isolation, abandonment and entrapment. However, I felt that things just didn't come together very well. I thought that some unsettling events that occur in the house would be explained or tie more strongly into the story and origin of the haunting, but they weren't in a satisfactory way. Don't get me wrong. There were some parts that were quite eerie. However, I think that this story could have been a lot more frightening than it was, considering the subject matter.One of the things I liked most about this novel was the authentic characters, most of whom are veterans who suffer from profound mental illness as a result of the horrors of the war. It was quite sad how they were viewed by the public and their families as a whole. As cowards in that they were emotionally and mentally affected by the events occurring on the Front. Only a veteran can truly attest to the statement \"War is Hell,\" and one would think that their loved ones would respect that they had survived and came home, even if they were tormented by their experiences. It was a slap in the face at how some of this men were treated, as if their surviving the war was an affront, as opposed to dying as \"heroes\". This aspect of the book spoke strongly to me, and gave me a lot to think about, as we still deal with veterans and how their lives are profoundly impacted by their war experiences. It's a good reminder to me to show sensitivity and to pray for their healing and restoration from their wounds.This story has a strong romantic element that I did appreciate, although it did seem kind of crammed into the story around the Gothic and paranormal suspense elements. I really liked Jack and Kitty both. They were strong characters who had both suffered and understood what rejection and isolation was. In Kitty's case, she was very wise beyond her young years, and carried her own set of battle scars. She actually keeps my interest the most and remains a rootable character throughout this novel. I do have to say that the veterans did grow on me and I hoped for their well-being over the course of the novel.I wish I liked this book more than I did, quite simply. For me, it failed to attain the potential the setting and story seems to promise. However, it was a good book, and I certainly did appreciate Kitty and Jack, and the setting and time period. For what it's worth, I think this would make a good movie.Overall rating: 3.5/5.0 stars."}, {"userName": "Magdalena aka A Bookaholic Swede", "userReviewDate": "Feb 21, 2017", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/1379514-magdalena-aka-a-bookaholic-swede", "userReview": "I read Lost Among the Living last year and loved it. Since then have I tried to get hold of Simone St. James other books. Silence for the Dead intrigued me with its stunning cover and interesting blurb. What is Kitty Weekes hiding? What's wrong with Portis House? And, what's Jack Yates, the war hero doing there? And, his the place really haunted?Silence for the Dead is an interesting book about a haunted hospital and patients that have mentally broken down by the war and basically are sent away since it's shameful to have a nervous breakdown. I was curious to see how it all would end, what haunted the hospital. However, I have to admit that even though the story was interesting did it lack thrilling elements and I never felt that I connected with any of the characters. It's a good book, just not so thrilling that I had hoped it to be. And the mystery, well, I was not overwhelmed by it, to be honest. This is not one to read if you want a chilling storyline. it felt more like a tragic gothic story with some romance. However, I think that the setting of the hospital, the brutal reality of the effect of the war had on the soldiers is what really captured my interest. If the book had been more about that and less about ghost had I perhaps liked the book more, which is strange since I did read it because I wanted a ghost story..."}, {"userName": "Elizabeth", "userReviewDate": "May 03, 2018", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/1762033-elizabeth", "userReview": "DNF.100 pages in and the story wasn't going anywhere."}, {"userName": "Caz", "userReviewDate": "Jun 02, 2014", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/4368838-caz", "userReview": "Simone St. James seems to be almost single-handedly revitalising the genre of the gothic historical romance, and her latest book, Silence for the Dead proved to be a very enjoyable example indeed.It\u2019s 1919, and twenty-year-old Kitty Weeks has been running away from her abusive father for the past four years. That means going from job to job, often under assumed names, and never staying in one place too long. She\u2019s gutsy and independent, and even though she can never completely shake them off, she refuses to allow her past experiences to beat her down. Her latest position, in the wilds of the north of England, is as a nurse at Portis House, an imposing mansion-turned-asylum for men suffering from shell-shock. She\u2019s not a nurse, of course, but she needs the job and wants to be somewhere she\u2019ll be difficult to find. With falsified references of her previous experience at a London hospital, Kitty blags her way in.The work is arduous and the days are long, as the place is terribly understaffed, but Kitty soon gets into the swing of things. Her lack of real nursing qualifications does not hinder her, and she quickly strikes up friendships with two of her fellow nurses, Martha and Nina. They gossip together and moan about sore feet and matron\u2019s edicts. I really enjoyed the dynamics of their relationship. An element of mystery is introduced when Kitty hears about the enigmatic \u201cPatient Sixteen,\u201d who never comes out of his room and whom, she discovers, one has to have special clearance to visit. Being one to take the opportunity to flout the rules, Kitty manages to meet him \u2013 and is astonished by what she discovers. The author gradually builds a sense of menace. We hear about strange noises, the patients\u2019 nightmares, and ghostly apparitions. There is clearly some sort of corruption going on which involves the visiting doctors and the house\u2019s owner. There are also questions surrounding the treatment (or rather, non-treatment) of the patients at Portis House and speculation as to why the previous owners disappeared so suddenly. Bumps in the night, a patient who shouldn\u2019t be there, possible conspiracies\u2026 Ms. St. James develops and intertwines her plot threads very cleverly, and I was utterly engrossed in the story from start to finish.Speaking as someone who has a particular interest in the history of First World War, I found the setting (a mental institution for soldiers suffering from shell-shock) to be the novel\u2019s true strength. Ms St. James has clearly done her homework on the way these men were viewed, treated, and so badly misunderstood: returned from one horror only to be plunged into another. Removed from family and friends and branded insane, they were locked away like criminals. All of them are well-rounded, engaging characters, and she skillfully evokes sympathy for their situations.The writing and pacing of the story are excellent. The action begins very slowly in the sense that the supernatural element is not introduced until we\u2019re well into the book, but I was so caught up in the relationships between Kitty and the other nurses, the stories of the various patients, and speculating as to the identity of \u201cPatient Sixteen\u201d that I never had that feeling of wanting things to get moving. I was happy to savour it all. I loved that the author takes her time establishing her characters and setting. I found her exploration of the way in which the men at Portis House were treated to be both informative and poignant. Ms. St. James has created such a fascinating set of characters and backstories, and established so well the conflicts between them, that the \u2018gothic\u2019 element was almost surplus to requirements! I would have been quite happy had the story been a straight mystery.I\u2019ve read a few reviews stating that the story seemed to lose impetus in the second half, but I disagree. I found myself just as riveted by the later part of the story as the beginning, which is in no small part due to the superb performance given by Mary Jane Wells. Ms Wells is a new-to-me narrator, but she has guaranteed herself a place on my \u201cnarrators to trust\u201d list based on this performance alone.Ms Wells\u2019 narration is well-paced and the character voices are sufficiently distinct in tone that there was never any question as to whether I was listening to speech or description. She has a pleasant, youthful-sounding voice, used to very good effect in her interpretation of Kitty, the chipper, cockney heroine. Dedicated, optimistic Martha is given a perfectly executed Scottish accent, and laconic, wry Nina has a lower-pitched, northern-accented drawl which suited her sardonic nature very well indeed. The male patients and orderlies are all clearly differentiated, too. Paulus, the head orderly, is South African, and Ms. Wells\u2019 accent is (mostly) spot on. Captain Mabry is given the slightly clipped tones one would expect from an officer, and she does a superb job with Archie, who has an unusual stammer. She adopts a slightly lower pitch to portray Jack, who, like Mabry, is often quite softly-spoken. Yet she also impeccably conveys his underlying sense of authority and cheeky insouciance as the story progresses.There are a few glaring Americanisms in the text. Closets instead of cupboards, suspenders instead of braces (believe me, the image of a man wearing what we call suspenders is not a particularly attractive or masculine one!) and an odd pronunciation of Passchendaele stuck out like sore thumbs, but these were very minor irritations.All in all, Silence for the Dead is a thoroughly enjoyable listening experience. The highlights for me are the setting and the stories and characterisation of the patients, but the principal story and narration are superb, too. I have no hesitation in recommending it very highly indeed."}, {"userName": "SheriC (PM)", "userReviewDate": "May 22, 2016", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/3899677-sheric-pm", "userReview": "This could have been an excellent little ghost story. The buildup of tension and mystery was very well done and the characters were intriguing, but I was disappointed in the final third of the story. Perhaps I should have expected the romance, but it felt forced and implausible, and it was incredibly inappropriate for the two main characters to be playing striptease and grab-ass when patients that the \u201cheroine\u201d was responsible for were dying, unattended, of influenza in another part of the building, and another patient that she was responsible for was missing and known to be dangerous. Yes, I know she was not a real nurse, but she had assumed the role and the responsibility. I was dissatisfied with the trite happily-ever-after marriage ending, where the heroine is suddenly over all her childhood trauma because of the hero\u2019s magic lovemaking. And the attitude of \u201cBTW, four patients died, but that\u2019s a pretty good death rate, so that\u2019s cool\u201d really chapped my sensibilities.This book touched on the real tragedy of WW I soldiers who dealt with \u201cshell shock\u201d, the absolute lack of medical and psychological care available to them at the time, the stigma of cowardice, weakness, and unmanliness attached to its victims, and the awful state of psychiatric care at the time. But it used it too lightly for my taste, using it as a mere backdrop, and really dropped the ball in wrapping the story up with the characters who suffered from it. The \u201cgood\u201d characters were able to miraculously just reintegrate to their homes and families (happily ever after!) and the \u201cbad\u201d and anonymous others were just shipped off to another psych hospital (out of sight, out of mind).Audiobook version, borrowed from my public library. Mary Jane Wells provided an excellent performance. I will look for her again as an audio narrator.I read this book for the 2016 Halloween Bingo, Ghost Stories and Haunted Houses square."}, {"userName": "Ariel", "userReviewDate": "Jul 06, 2014", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/5079976-ariel", "userReview": "I have loved the writing of Simone St. James since her first and my favorite book that she's written, The Haunting of Maddy Clare. This is now her third book and she has perfected a formula of Gothic creepiness with a dash of romance that is right up my alley.In this novel, lead character Kitty, has accepted a job as a nurse at a remote mental hospital that caters to the wealthy, veteran men of the Great War. The Portis house the hospital is ensconced in is falling apart and the previous family that lived there has mysteriously disappeared. The patients are having nightmares but the cause may be more than the horrors they saw in war. An evil presence seems to reside in the house causing some of the patients to attempt to kill themselves in a certain spot. One of my first thoughts with this kind of novel is always why would anyone chose to work in a place clearly fraught with danger. Kitty like many Gothic heroines who are thrust into such situations has no choice. She lied to secure her position and she is penniless with no where else to go. Kitty spends the novel attempting to get to the bottom of the secrets of Portis House while trying to hide a few secrets of her own. I adore Gothic historical fiction so I was pretty happy with Simone's latest novel. The plot kept me turning the pages and I especially enjoy novels set during this time period. Kitty is a spunky heroine who is determined not to let life's set backs hold her back. I enjoyed reading about her as well as the veterans of the Great War who inhabit the hospital. Simone has written another engaging novel and I look forward to her next novel about mediums with anticipation."}, {"userName": "Clarissa Johal", "userReviewDate": "Mar 22, 2014", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/6561993-clarissa-johal", "userReview": "I LOVE Simone St. James style of writing and this one did not disappoint.

If you saw Crimson Peak and loved it, then I think you will really enjoy this book.One of the things that I liked about that film was how the house and ghosts both haunted the characters and this book does something similar and the effect is memorable and so wonderfully suspenseful!This is my final Simone St James book and I really wanted to end her books on a high note, and that\u2019s exactly what I did. I think this one was one of my favorites by her!This book was different in some ways than her other books. I loved that the house itself was a big part of the ghost story. There were other ghosts but the house was like this sinister presence that truly added a lot of horror to the book itself. Again, her books are paranormal boarding on horror but not to the point of terrifying. I would say more like spine tingling and creepy. This one was a little more horror but again, not over done where it would only appeal to certain readers. I really liked that the ghosts and house in this book weren\u2019t you usual \u2018help put me to rest ghosts\u2019. One of the ghosts and sinister in the extreme and I like how that keeps readers scared but yet pushes them to want to know why the ghost and the house are so dangerous.Also the idea of madness was much more the main gothic element than ghosts. Turn of the century or Victorian era madhouses really appeal to me when it comes to gothic elements. There is something about the setting which really makes me as a reader feel uneasy. Are the patients really crazy or are they made crazy from the \u2018treatments\u2019? That\u2019s exactly what I got in this book and I was on edge and wasn\u2019t sure if I could trust the characters\u2026..I loved how that worked together with the ghosts to create a memorable and extra suspenseful gothic read. That alone earned 5 stars from me!The complexity of the romance really hit a high mark. Jack is a patient in the madhouse by his own choice which makes readers wonder how the romance will work. Kitty was equally flawed and not your normal heroine. She\u2019s a liar with a checkered past and she has zero scruples when it comes to saving herself. You don\u2019t want to like her but yet you do\u2026she\u2019s sympathetic and you can see how putting her and Jack together quickly developed into a romance. They are both flawed and complex which makes the romance work for me.Overall this is one of my favorite books by her and I absolutely loved it. I read it in a day and was sad when it ended. I feel like I\u2019ve really gotten to read something special when I read one of her books. I love how she uses the gothic elements to create a unique story for readers, again she reminds me of a modern Victoria Holt and I absolutely love it. I will gladly read any of her books. I am sad now because it\u2019s so hard to find really good gothic/romantic suspense writers. It\u2019s just not a genre that a lot of people write in, so as always I am on the lookout for similar books.

The plot is deft and intricate and at the end, all threads are woven together, and some in ways that I did not foresee. There are numerous themes that interlink with other themes too, and it takes until the end of the novel for the bigger picture to emerge, and for this reason alone, I found Silence for the Dead utterly engrossing. There are plenty of other reasons though why I loved this book.Kitty Weekes is perhaps St. James's most resilient heroine. I'm deliberately avoiding patronizing adjectives like \"plucky\" or \"spunky\" because Kitty is just heroic, plain and simple. Her backstory as a survivor of abuse weaves its way into the present moment of the ghost story in admirable ways. In less ghostly ways though, Kitty is quick on her feet and able to find ways to survive a highly discriminatory job market where she has few skills to exist outside of a father's income or marriage. It's thrilling though to watch her simultaneously dodge danger, of both the ghostly and non-ghostly kinds, and thrive in a setting that would doom most people. The setting here too is one of the best I've encountered in a St. James books, and it reminded me at times of Agatha Christie's And Then There Were None where inhabitants gradually become more and more aware of the danger they are in as well as the difficulty of getting out alive. The violent storm in the penultimate scenes further imperil the inhabits that is straight out of the classic Christie mystery novel too. At the start of the novel Portis House has been renovated from a grand English mansion into an asylum for soldiers suffering PTSD. The mansion's isolation from the closest small village atop cliffs overlooking the sea makes it especially atmospheric and claustrophobic and lends itself to the danger from the hauntings that take place there. After Kitty schemes and lies her way into a position as a nurse in this remote place, she quickly learns that her sanctuary may not be quite the refuge she had hoped. The danger to the residents piles on as more is discovered about the mystery behind Portis House and why it has been abandoned. I have to say too that the metaphors of decay are as powerful as the literal decay at the center of the story.The hero is revealed slowly in this story but the revelation adds to the mysteries. Once his story is revealed, it becomes apparent how perfect a foil he is to Kitty's intrepid and sometimes impulsive behavior. Mental illness is also a big part of the hero's story and the story at large, and I found this issue so well developed here because it is importantly contrasted with aberrant behaviors like misogyny and narcissism, which cannot be accorded the same sympathy or clumped together. Mental illness is always a theme in St. James's books, which are set post WWI and attends to the harm inflicted on an entire generation of young men returning from the horrors of modern warfare. The injustice done to them after their return parallels that done to them in battle, and that theme intersects with the many stories within the larger one here.One final thought: the last line of this book is just haunting. Unlike other books she's written, the mystery is a bit more open ended and the resolution, or what there is of it, is chilling. Now I have to wait until 2018 for another new book from this wonderful author."}, {"userName": "Giedre", "userReviewDate": "Sep 08, 2016", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/5487874-giedre", "userReview": "3.5/5The ending is the only reason I'm not giving it four stars.

SILENCE FOR THE DEAD takes place at a remote insane asylum right after the Great War, when the bravery of young men and women wasn't without consequences. Ghosts, evil and some subtle comedic moments mixed in with a really good mystery that slowly unravels rounds out St. James' latest endeavor.I have always loved gothic romance and author Simone St. James is one of the best at combining a wraithlike ambiance and great characters with unusual circumstances, layered with romance in a mystery that slowly builds into a crescendo of chaos at the end, leaving the characters successful, if not a bit shaken from their experience.I've become such a fan of Simone St. James' talent that I bought this book in trade paperback when it didn't come from the publisher for review. I'm reviewing it for Romance Junkies because I know there are a large group of us gothic fans at that site who crave these types of stories.In the beginning, we meet Katherine \"Kitty\" Weekes while she's approaching Portis House by motorcar in England along the coast in 1919. It's naturally foggy, creating a sense of foreboding from the very first page. The mansion was once owned by a wealthy family who mysteriously disappeared during the war and were thought to have moved away, leaving their enormous home to eventually be adapted as a mental hospital for men. Remote as it is, escape isn't likely. But Kitty has no desire to escape, she plans to be their nurse and never leave.It doesn't take long for the matron-in-charge to reveal to Kitty that she knows she lied about her references and that she also knows that Kitty is no nurse. But the matron's superior is the one who hired Kitty so there's only one thing to do, let her stay and wait for her to mess up enough to let her go. But Kitty has nowhere else to go and this remote hospital is a perfect place to hide, if she can work hard enough and curb her insolent attitude. Matron may try to curb that attitude but Kitty isn't going anywhere without a fight.Kitty Weekes is a really fun character. We're not sure what or who she's hiding from, at first, and we don't actually know her entire story until closer to the end of the book. She's sassy and has a smart-alecky, mouthy way about her that makes you cheer for whatever nonsense she's getting into now. Of course, you know she'll meet the man she falls for but their journey is unusual, keeping Kitty unsettled about one more thing in her life. Kitty doesn't seem compassionate enough to be a nurse, but she makes up in stamina, courage and spunk for what she lacks in empathy. Will she learn to love her life and others, once she finds her purpose?One of the best parts of this book is getting to know the large cast of characters from the nurses to the orderlies, to the doctors who bring out the best and the worst in the patients and staff, including the mysterious \"patient sixteen,\" while all are tormented by the evil within the house. A good gothic story isn't complete without the personality of the house, living and breathing more life into the story. This one is a doozy so I'm sure gothic fans will enjoy the creepy parts as much as I did.I love the way St. James layers a story. She builds ever so slowly, adding bits and pieces little by little, sort of lulling you into a relaxed pace, and if you've read her books, you know that something is coming, expect it with anticipation and can't wait to jump. I love that moment when the evil reveals itself as a character worth fearing and those dangling chapter ends that make you jump to the next chapter with expectation. It's like a nail down the chalkboard moment, sending chills down your spine and forcing you to madly read faster to the end, even though you're not sure if you want to know.I also love the wry humor in the most unlikely places. They zing their way into the story and give some comedic relief to the ominous tension. Kitty Weekes had some great lines but I also loved Nina and Mabry \u2014 they both provided me with a laugh-out-loud surprise.THE HAUNTING OF MADDY CLARE is still my favorite Simone St. James novel, but SILENCE FOR THE DEAD has a similar atmosphere and is well worth experiencing, offering us a glimpse at another time and place. It's less explicit, so those who prefer a less sensual romance will appreciate the subtlety in SILENCE FOR THE DEAD. If you love a great fictional tale that focuses on a wide variety of characters, adds mystery and a bit of the supernatural, then rounds out with a happy-for-now ending in a romance that complements the suspense but doesn't take it over, then I recommend you grab SILENCE FOR THE DEAD. It has that pre-1920s after-the-war vibe that will engage this era's fans. Simone St. James embodies gothic romance with a style all her own, evolving with each tale she spins.Reviewed by Dorine, courtesy of Romance Junkies."}, {"userName": "Kimberly", "userReviewDate": "Mar 17, 2018", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/30144492-kimberly", "userReview": "The first book I read by Simone St James was, An Inquiry into Love and Death. I loved it and became an instant fan. I liked this book too; the setting, the characters, the situations the possible haunting and various mysteries about the patients in the building and of the building itself. Many times I kept waiting for bigger climaxes but it kept falling short. The book had great potential but fell short for me. Im still going to seek out more books by St James, she is a great writer. The book was just so-so for me."}, {"userName": "Katherine", "userReviewDate": "Feb 13, 2017", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/13311251-katherine", "userReview": "\u201dI couldn\u2019t do it. I couldn\u2019t. I\u2019d been so certain, but I\u2019d miscalculated. That hand on me- I could still feel it, and it made me sick. I\u2019d thought I\u2019d be caring for madmen, simpletons, drooling idiots. I hadn\u2019t thought they\u2019d be men. And now, I was locked up with them in this place, miles from anything\u201d\nIsn\u2019t it such a disappointing feeling when an author you know you love writes a book that you don\u2019t like? It\u2019s like we build a trust for the author, the reliability of their writing and the knowledge of the fact that whatever they write will be good. So when the exact opposite happens, you feel a sense of disappointment.I adored her debut novel The Haunting of Maddy Clare, which I read and loved last year. And I read An Inquiry Into Love and Death, which I equally loved. But this one fell completely flat for me. I think it\u2019s because that with the last two novels, both of them had equally likable, plucky, badass protagonist. This heroine was quite possibly the most incompetent, clueless woman I\u2019ve come across in fiction.Kitty Weekes is a woman on the run, though we\u2019re not quite sure from what or whom. I\u2019m sure I would have found out if I had gone further along in the novel, but the problems for me started in the very beginning. You see, Kitty Weekes makes her escape by stealing her friend\u2019s resume and applying for a nursing job. I wouldn\u2019t normally have a problem with this... if it hadn\u2019t been for the tiny little fact that Kitty has no nursing degree or experience. To make matters worse, she thinks it\u2019s a fucking walk in the park.Now, I\u2019m not a nurse. Never have been, and never intend to be. However, I have friends who are nurses, and let me tell you, it\u2019s no walk in the park as the main character dreams it up to be, especially when dealing with mental patients. Not to mention the fact that she probably should have been arrested on the spot for stealing her friends resume and application. And for some reason, they still let her in. Look, I know these people are desperate, but really?The hospital is set in an old, haunted mansion, which is a ripe plot for spooky hauntings. Kitty manages to sneak her way into the hospital and whine about her job, she manages to weasel her way into the room of the hospital\u2019s mysterious patient. His name is Jack Yates, and he\u2019s as mysterious as he\u2019s dangerous. Or so the author says. To me, he was extremely boring and his motives questionable. I never could figure him out fully, and wondered why the heck he was so sequestered in the first place, other than the reasons that were given, which were thin and ludicrous. A ghost in an insane asylum? Yes, please! But pairing an unlikable female protagonist and a vanilla hero makes for an uncompelling read."}, {"userName": "Susan", "userReviewDate": "Mar 30, 2018", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/21502628-susan", "userReview": "Creepy and suspenseful, this book had me hooked from the start! I loved all the soldiers and I felt really bad for how they were shunned by their families when they came back from the war injured or just depressed. What they used to call \"shell shock\" we would now call PTSD. It was very clever of the author to situate these men in a real life haunted house. They are the ultimate unreliable narrators and it's hard for the men, and the reader to know if the ghosts are real or hallucinations. No one questions screams and nightmares in the night in an insane asylum! Kitty is a great protagonist. Smart, resourceful and a determined survivor. The ending was satisfying and I truly enjoyed the whole book so much."}, {"userName": "Beckie", "userReviewDate": "Dec 31, 2013", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/16533050-beckie", "userReview": "I received this book through a Goodreads First Reads giveaway. This is my first Simone St. James book, but after reading this one, I will be reading more by her. I found this book catching my attention and didn't want to put it down at times, and when I came to the end, I wanted it to keep going on. I enjoyed the characters; so much so I wanted the story to go on and tell more about each of them that was there in the end. Kitty arrives at Portis House, a mansion turned asylum, with forged documents and running from her past. Though Matron knows the papers are faked, being desperate for staff, hires Kitty on anyway, thus beginning Kitty's new life as a nurse at Portis House. With only four nurses on staff, and one seeming to be Matron's second, the hours are long and the work is grueling. Kitty seems to be intent on breaking rules, whether meaning to or not, including meeting the mysterious \"Patient Sixteen\" who she is told only those with special clearance are able to enter his room. Kitty soon learns all the patients seem to be afflicted with the same nightmares and seeing things that shouldn't be there. When she sees her own \"vision\" she begins to question her sanity but wins the confidence of the men living in Portis House by her understanding and confession of her own sights. She begins to investigate things around Portis House looking for answers to what really happened there, including why the previous nurse fled in the middle of the night. While she starts to investigate, she makes an unlikely ally with Patient Sixteen, who refuses to let her do it alone. They endure both tragedy and surprises along the way. I really enjoyed this book. At the end, I did want to know the how of how everything seemed to be settled, as it seemed like what the ghosts purpose of still being around hadn't actually been settled, but it seemed more a small nagging wonder in the back of my mind than anything that took away from the story at all.

Hiding the shame of their mental instability in what was once a magnificent private estate, the patients suffer from nervous attacks and tormenting dreams. But something more is going on at Portis House\u2014its plaster is crumbling, its plumbing makes eerie noises, and strange breaths of cold waft through the empty rooms. It\u2019s known that the former occupants left abruptly, but where did they go?
