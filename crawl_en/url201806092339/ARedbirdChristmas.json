I enjoyed the humor with which the author weaves this tale, the characters are rich and believable, and the relationship between the man and the Redbird (Jack) is touching and sweet. I was pleasantly surprised to learn that the Fannie Flagg that I knew as a comedian was also an accomplished author. This is an easy Christmas tale that I would recommend to readers of all ages."}, {"userName": "Phrynne", "userReviewDate": "Feb 10, 2014", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/8655084-phrynne", "userReview": "A short, sweet book about life in small town America where good things happen to good people and bad things to bad people.

Campbell, aged fifty-two, down-and-out in a Chicago winter, is given only months to live unless he moves South... He finds himself in the small town of Lost River, Alabama, where the residents are friendly if feud-prone and eccentric to a fault. One of them, Roy, keeps a red cardinal, a once wounded bird called Jack. Patsy, a sad, sweet little kid with a crippled leg, from the trailer park up in the woods, takes to dropping by the store - and falls in love with Jack.Flagg takes us on an emotional roller-coaster ride through the lives and hearts of an engaging crew of misfits, fixers and ordinary good-hearted folk, set against the vivid natural backdrop of a mellow Alabama winter, along the riverside where birds and fish abound. Her enchanting story culminates at Christmastide with surprises and a magical 'redbird' moment.Opening: The Windy City: It was only November sixth but Chicago had just been hit with its second big blizzard of the season, and Mr Oswald T Campbell guessed he had stepped in every ice-cold ankle-deep puddle of dirty white slush it was possible to step in, trying to get to his appointment.Somewhat twee, yet not as saccharine as some. Surely the term is Cajun not Creole, if my cult-yar classes steered me right."}, {"userName": "Lyubov", "userReviewDate": "Dec 11, 2017", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/17778059-lyubov", "userReview": "\u041a\u043d\u0438\u0433\u0430\u0442\u0430 \u0441\u0438 \u0435 \u0447\u0438\u0441\u0442\u0438 2 \u0437\u0432\u0435\u0437\u0434\u0438, \u043f\u044a\u043b\u043d\u0430 \u0435 \u0441 \u043a\u043b\u0438\u0448\u0435\u0442\u0430 \u043e\u0442 \u043f\u044a\u0440\u0432\u0430 \u0434\u043e \u043f\u043e\u0441\u043b\u0435\u0434\u043d\u0430 \u0441\u0442\u0440\u0430\u043d\u0438\u0446\u0430. \u041d\u043e \u0432 \u043c\u043e\u043c\u0435\u043d\u0442\u0430 \u044f\u0432\u043d\u043e \u0438\u043c\u0430\u043c \u043d\u0443\u0436\u0434\u0430 \u0442\u043e\u0447\u043d\u043e \u043e\u0442 \u043a\u0443\u043f\u0447\u0438\u043d\u043a\u0430 \u0443\u044e\u0442\u043d\u0438 \u043a\u043b\u0438\u0448\u0435\u0442\u0430, \u0442\u0430\u043a\u0430 \u0447\u0435 \u0441\u043b\u0430\u0433\u0430\u043c \u0440\u043e\u0437\u043e\u0432\u0438\u0442\u0435 \u0447\u0438\u0442\u0430\u0442\u0435\u043b\u0441\u043a\u0438 \u043e\u0447\u0438\u043b\u0430 \u0438 \u0434\u0430\u0432\u0430\u043c 3 \u0437\u0432\u0435\u0437\u0434\u0438 \u0441 \u043a\u0435\u0444 :)"}, {"userName": "Ann", "userReviewDate": "Nov 17, 2009", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/967506-ann", "userReview": "***SPOILER ALERT***Predictable.

She gives the perfect nuance to the quintessential southern charm she embodies in her novels. Filled with loveable, eccentric characters that touched my heart, making me feel a part of their community. Humourous, sometimes tragic and brimming with love and hope, a wonderful story of a Christmas miracle."}, {"userName": "Kandice", "userReviewDate": "Aug 17, 2009", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/1396160-kandice", "userReview": "I audio-ed this and for anyone who has read Flagg and is familiar with her friendly style of story telling I cannot recommend listening to her read her won books enough. I grew up in West Virginia so Flagg\u2019s accent reminds me of any number of my relatives. She sounds so sweet and forgiving even when describing someone on a drinking binge. You know what I mean, like when someone talks about how dumb or ugly someone is, but throws a \u201cbless their heart\u201d in every once in a while to take away the sting.Like all of her other novels, this is set in small town, Lost River here, and Lost River is as much a character as any of the people. We begin our story with an older man living in Chicago who is told he must move to the southern climate if he hopes to survive more than six months. Through a series of coincidences and misunderstandings Oswald is able to rent a room for very little money in Lost River and packs up and migrates south.The majority of the story is about Oswald learning to care about the others in this small community and especially how to allow them to care for him in return. In addition to the new adults he meets, Oswald\u2019s heart is stolen by an abandoned little girl, Patsy. Not only is Patsy alone and poor, but she is has a deformity (caused by an untreated injury) that makes her drag her foot behind her. Not only Oswald, but the entire town take it upon themselves to care for and raise this little girl. She is a lifeline for Oswald and the love Flagg shows through the story is heartwarming without being sappy.I think Flagg\u2019s main talent is to temper her sweet stories with truth. Real people do bad things, even the very, very good people. Flagg\u2019s characters are no different. People fight, drink and carry on, but their reasons allow you to love them. Flagg\u2019s characters accept each other for what and who they are not what and who they want each other to be. Too bad we aren't all like that."}, {"userName": "Jenny", "userReviewDate": "Apr 18, 2008", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/1095451-jenny", "userReview": "Absolutely the best Christmas book ever!

Audiobook, read by the author, who does not provide a very polished performance but nevertheless read with warmth and authenticity."}, {"userName": "Ashley", "userReviewDate": "Dec 29, 2007", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/236367-ashley", "userReview": "Better than warm chocolate chip cookies and a fire in the fireplace, Fannie Flagg always makes me feel good about the world and people in general.  A Redbird Christmas  tells a very touching story about a man on the brink of death in Chicago who is advised to move South to a more temperate climate or risk dying from pneumonia. With only a medical pension, he cannot afford Florida, but he can afford to rent a room on the Lost River in Alabama where, for the first time in his life, he finds a home and all the dreams he never knew he had come true. This story is about the way people ought to live, full of love, generosity, and compassion."}, {"userName": "Serendipity Reviews", "userReviewDate": "Feb 09, 2011", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/1886570-serendipity-reviews", "userReview": "I am so glad that I managed to find this gorgeous little book by Fannie Flagg, it really did give me a glow in my heart. Fannie Flagg is one of those authors who makes you believe that miracles really do happen. Her books are just so heartwarming to read and full of surprises and wonder. This is a rather short book but packed full to the brim of interesting and heartwarming characters. The book begins with Oswald, a depressed former alcoholic who has been given months to live. After reading a brochure given to him by his doctor, he decides to move from the bitter cold of Chicago to the warmer climate of Lost River, Alabama. Oswald is a pitiful character, who cannot see a future to get excited about and it is lovely to see how his whole persona is transformed during his time at Lost River. He changes from someone who cannot see any further than his death to a self made man with a rosy future and an instant family.Lost River is a town full of Golden Girls and Steel Magnolias. These women are very strong characters and reminded me a lot of the female characters in Fried Green Tomatoes At The Whistlestop Cafe. They are self sufficient and help to create a warm welcome to all the lost souls that wander into Lost River. Two of the main characters within the book are rather unusual leads. Firstly, there is Jack the rare Red Cardinal, which was saved from death by the local shop owner Pat. You cannot help but love Jack as he mixes with the characters in the book. He is loved by all, as he creates havoc. He is especially loved by the second unusual lead character, Patsy, the trailer park child with a crippled leg. Both of these characters will grab hold of your emotions from their first appearance and tie your heartstrings into knots. You cannot help but laugh and cry at their adventures.This is a truly wonderful heartwarming book. I would love to say I had nothing bad to comment on it, but I do have two minor irritations.Firstly the copy of the book that I now own had loads of spelling mistakes. Well I think they were spelling mistakes unless drug stores are now known as drag stores. Or maybe the little girl liked to also be known as Pasty! Now I know I am not always on the ball with my spellings and my grammar, but you can't buy my blog from a book store! I just wish the editors had been a little more meticulous when proofreading the final copy.Secondly, the ending slightly bothered me. Everything was wrapped up a little too quickly and a little too neatly for my liking. It would have been more enjoyable if the ending had been longer, giving the character's wrap up more of a natural development.I definitely want to read more by Fannie Flagg and hope to get hold of her other books soon. Perhaps I will have a Fannie Flagg month next year too."}, {"userName": "Donna", "userReviewDate": "Nov 19, 2016", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/13244359-donna", "userReview": "Everything Fannie Flagg does well as an author, she does in this book. This was a happy, feel-good Christmas story, complete with hope, wonder, and love. The characters were wonderfully quirky and I loved the charm of the hometown feel. I completely enjoyed the journey of this one. This story had many threads woven in. It was about a town, not just an individual. And I loved the idea of the redbird.

I love receiving books, they bring with them authors I've not heard of them. This is a heart warming story, based in a small village. It's set around Christmas (but can be read anytime of the year). It's light easy reading, with great bit of humour.

I don't usually enjoy the run of the mill, sappy sweet Christmas stories, but lucky for me this wasn't one of them. While the story is very sweet, it isn't predictable.

She portrays small southern (U.S.) towns in a heartwarming yet truthful way. This is a sweet, not saccharine, story set in Lost River, Alabama with Christmastime as a thread throughout. It's full of characters, some broken, some not who come together to create an \"accidental\" family with magic happening along the way.I always enjoy listening to Flagg tell her own story. It struck me this time that she does not voice the characters as professional narrators would do to differentiate them for the listener, but tells us the story as if she were reading it to us. This audiobook includes an interview with the author about how she came to write and how she approaches developing the characters and story.

Heartwarming is the perfect word to describe it. A great Holiday season read for sure, but I still loved it in the month of May. Quirky, sweet characters and yes, a little bit of cliche but it just made me smile (and cry at parts)! I will be buying my own copy.

After a startling diagnosis from his doctor, Oswald T. Campbell leaves behind the cold and damp of the oncoming Chicago winter to spend what he believes will be his last Christmas in the warm and welcoming town of Lost River. There he meets the postman who delivers mail by boat, the store owner who nurses a broken heart, the ladies of the Mystic Order of the Royal Polka Dots Secret Society, who do clandestine good works.

Once you experience the wonder, you too will never forget A Redbird ChristmasIn A Sentence: A cute read \u2026*sniff* It made me cry.My Thoughts: I\u2019ve been debating how to rate this novel. One the one hand, I\u2019m not sure I\u2019ll ever read this story again; once seems enough. On the other hand, I couldn\u2019t stop reading (even though it was past 1 o-clock in the morning and I had to get up early), and the ending made me cry. So I decided a 4.5-star rating would work just fine.Fannie Flagg is the master of comfort reads. I\u2019ve yet to read a book of hers where I didn\u2019t feel better by the end (Can\u2019t Wait To Get To Heaven is a huge favorite of mine). This story was no exception. It was sweet and lovely, with savory characters, and, as always, a happy ending for everyone (this isn\u2019t a spoiler\u2014anyone can see that this will be a happy ending from the get-go). The writing is wholesome, and it\u2019s a really cool idea to have recipes in the back of the book. Plus, the pace is nice and steady from beginning to end, with spouts of humor peppered throughout.While I wouldn\u2019t consider this to be Flagg\u2019s best novel, it\u2019s still pretty good and worth a look at the very least. It\u2019s ideal for the holiday season, and you won\u2019t regret spending time with this little book. I definitely recommend this novel for those who like the occasional comfort read."}, {"userName": "Elena T.", "userReviewDate": "Mar 17, 2016", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/39086536-elena-t", "userReview": "Lo spirito frizzante di Fannie Flagg allieta dolcemente la grigia quotidianit\u00e0 di chi \u00e8 alle prese con il lavoro, gli impegni, lo studio - con l'esito confortante che sovente ricerchiamo quando abbiamo bisogno di una calda coperta di plaid che ci avvolga.\"Mr. Zuppa Campbell, il pettirosso e la bambina\" (\"A Redbird Christmas\" in originale, al solito ci piace stravolgere il titolo) \u00e8 proprio come il suo pi\u00f9 celebre \"Pomodori verdi fritti al Caff\u00e8 di Whistle Stop\": un toccasana per l'anima intorpidita di noi comuni mortali.E' l'affresco disincantato e magico di una spensierata cittadina dell' Alabama, Lost River, che per qualche tempo si trova ad ospitare il solitario, burbero, Mr. Campbell \u2013 un habitu\u00e9 della citt\u00e0 (Chicago) a cui il medico ha intimato di trasferirsi a Sud, verso un clima pi\u00f9 temperato, per questioni di salute legate allo stress e alla rigidit\u00e0 dell'inverno.Al suo arrivo nella campagnola, piccola Lost River, conoscer\u00e0 tra tutti Roy \u2013 gestore di un negozio di alimentari- il suo pettirosso Jack (in realt\u00e0 uccello cardinale, la traduzione si \u00e8 presa anche qui qualche libert\u00e0) la mascotte della citt\u00e0 e una sfuggente bambina.E' la storia semplice, pura e toccante, di come una citt\u00e0 e dei veri amici possano per sempre cambiare la concezione di vita di un uomo solo.Fannie Flagg ci regala in poche pagine l'equivalente di un biscotto al cioccolato mangiato davanti al camino, una lettura calda e gustosa come tutti i suoi precedenti e successivi lavori ed un ritratto accattivante di una cittadina in America rimasta indietro nel tempo, dove puoi andare a letto lasciando la finestra aperta, chiedere dello zucchero al vicino e contare sempre sulla bont\u00e0 degli altri."}, {"userName": "Kiwi Begs2Differ  \u270e", "userReviewDate": "Nov 21, 2015", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/12287031-kiwi-begs2differ", "userReview": "This novel is not going to win any literary awards and yes it is overly sweet but it was perfect for getting me into the right mood for Christmas season.
