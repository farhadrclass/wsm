Warning: reading this book will keep you up late\u2014compelled to discover the final, exciting conclusion to this wonderful book.Robin Caroll\u2019s characters were strong, brassy and real. Roark reminded me of the U.S. Marshall in the movie The Fugitive. He liked to be in control of everything. His motto, \u201cDon\u2019t let them see your weakness.\u201dBrannon reminded me of the female character in G.I. Jane. She\u2019s a rough and tough girl you don\u2019t want to mess with when she\u2019s working. Here\u2019s a peak at how Brannon snaps at Roark, \u201d Let me tell you something, Mr. Marshall. I don\u2019t care how big and important you think you are\u2014you will not make it out of these mountains without our guidance. So you can stop with the arrogance and know-it-all, take-charge attitude. We must work together to survive.\u201d I felt like I was in the middle of an action adventure movie with fighting, shooting, chase scenes, fires, helicopters and police drama. This is an intriguing story filled with suspense, hope, forgiveness and justice. I enjoyed the comradery among the characters and how they chased down the bad guys. But, I especially enjoyed how this author wove a believable spiritual thread into the story; keeping the main thing the main thing even in the middle of war - I like that.There\u2019s a race to set little girls free from brothels in the USA, before they\u2019re shipped to another location. I think Robin handled the topic of sex-trafficking with grace. I\u2019m sure conditions in brothels are worse than described. The author notes she hadn\u2019t realized how serious this problem was before doing research. It\u2019s horrific.I enjoyed every second of this book. Can\u2019t wait to read the sequel called Fear No Evil. Way to go, Robin Caroll, on writing such a great and exciting debut novel.Disclosure of Material Connection: I received a complimentary copy of this book from the publisher.

It currently ranks as my favorite read of 2010. I found myself saying over and over again to my husband what a great movie this book would make! Of course, reading it was far better than watching a movie but the storyline would seriously make for an impressive movie! Robin's writing has just the right amount of balance of romance and suspense in it. I really appreciated that she brings awareness to an issue that I have been hearing more and more about in recent years....child trafficking here in the United States. I think often times when we think of child trafficking we tend to think of other countries but the truth is, it's happening right here in America under our noses. Robin has written a fictional story here and it's so well written that you simply can't walk away from the book without feeling a burden in your heart for the many children who are being caught up in this industry. Robins writings reflect the seriousness of the situation of child trafficking without being too graphic.In Deliver Us From Evil, the main character Brannon Callahan is a search and rescue helicopter pilot for the Great Smoky Mountains National Park. She and her work partner have a strong faith in God. She is a beautiful and yet tough woman but nothing could really prepare her for what she encounters. A blizzard takes down a small plane carrying U.S. Marshal Roark Holland in the Great Smoky Mountains. Brannon and her partner are sent into the mountains with their rescue helicopter to save the Marshall and the donor heart he is carrying with him. The heart needs to arrive at a TN hospital right outside of the Smoky Mountains in a certain amount of time in order to save the life of a government witness that is dying. The witness has information the FBI needs in order to bring down one of the largest child-trafficking rings in the history of the U.S., which just happens to be located in Tennessee, right under Brannons nose.Robin gives some websites in the back of the book on child trafficking and she has a lot more information posted on her blog. Deliver us From Evil was my first book of Robins to read and I am anxious to check out more of her work after enjoying this one so much!"}, {"userName": "Virginia", "userReviewDate": "Feb 28, 2010", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/1403403-virginia", "userReview": "Search-and-rescue helicopter pilot Brannon Callahan responds to a crisis when another chopper carrying a U.S. Marshal goes down in the Great Smoky Mountains National Park during a blizzard. Roark is carrying a human heart to be transplanted into a government witness whose testimony can break up a horrible child trafficking ring \u2013 if he lives long enough. Together they rush to get the heart to the hospital, unaware that a brothel housing dozens of desperate and brutalized young girls is nearer than they imagine.In Deliver Us from Evil, Robin Caroll has created a fast-paced, riveting story that is both compelling and horrifying. Compelling because of the well-honed skill Caroll expertly uses to draw us into the lives and mission of Brannon and Roark. Horrifying when we realize that the business of kidnapping children and forcing them into sexual slavery is very real, and thrives even in our so-called \u2018enlightened\u2019 society. With the same skill Caroll uses to bring Brannon and Roark to life, she gives us a vivid glimpse into the life of Mai, one of the kidnapped girls who is desperate to escape the brutality that has become a way of life. This little girl\u2019s plight will break your heart. I was highly impressed with Caroll\u2019s skill in portraying the horrors she endured without once resorting to relaying the graphic details. The suspense plot is undergirded with spiritual strength, and I loved the way the characters quote scripture to each other. It demonstrated seamlessly how scripture is an integral part of the lives of believers. Also entwined with the suspense is the romance that grows between Brannon and Roark, and I enjoyed watching their relationship develop. Thanks so much to the B&H Publishing Group for sending me this copy to review. I highly recommend this book to anyone who enjoys romantic suspense. I pray this story touches hearts, and spurs many to action on behalf of the thousands of children who pray daily Deliver Us from Evil."}, {"userName": "Cheryl", "userReviewDate": "Jan 15, 2010", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/1179650-cheryl", "userReview": "U.S. Marshall Roark Holland still has nightmares about Mindy, The little girl that he let down.

I have to admit, though, that the beginning of the book was a little slow.

It is of the same type of romantic suspense book with a Christian message that anyone who has read the books of Dee Henderson, particularly her *O\u2019Malley Chronicles* will recognize quickly. There are some differences, however. In the story, we meet a US Marshall named Roark Holland, who is traumatized by the death of a little girl that he failed to save. Even though he did nothing wrong, and it was beyond his control, he still is racked by the guilt of \u201cfailing\u201d the child. When he is cleared to come back to work, he is given what should be a simple assignment, to transport an organ for transplant into a witness who can help the FBI possibly break open a ring of sickening monsters who traffic in child prostitutes. On the way, through a series of adventures, he meets and bonds with some US Park Rangers, including the beautiful and fiery Brannon Callahan. And, well, you can imagine that sparks fly from there. The story is quite believable in the details that are put forth. The mannerisms, lingo, way of acting, and so forth, that the characters use is spot-on. Like Henderson before her, you can tell that Caroll really did her homework on the subject of how law enforcement and military would act in a certain situation.She also did homework on the horrors of the very real existence of these sickening groups that traffic in children. The plights of the young ones in the story tore at my insides. I felt this rage swell up in me, and a desire to stop this evil where I can. For her bringing the issue to light, she deserves enormous praise. We must all learn about this issue, and do what we can to fight these horrors. The part of the book that is unrealistic is how neat the coincidences were. Very few cases are ever this neat and tidy. Also of a very unrealistic nature is the neat situation of the protagonist being a Christian, but just \u201cdistant\u201d. The situation of Kate O\u2019Malley in Henderson\u2019s books is more realistic. Both types of people exist, but the number of people in these professions hostile to faith outnumbers by far those favorable to it. The world is presented much more realistically in Henderson\u2019s works than Caroll\u2019s. What is also unrealistic, and bothered me, is how the protagonist gets over his psychological trauma so easily. Yes, God can and does help those who look to Him for guidance, but I have experienced these issues myself, and they are not so easy as just me being bad for not having enough faith. The message Caroll sends, inadvertent or not, is that we lack faith if we do not get over it right away after praying to the Lord. This is unrealistic, and very unhelpful to Christians who struggle with these issues. What is realistic, however, is the way in which the character who does find the Lord does so. In the heat of battle for the military, or a bust or shootout, bombing, or so forth, for law enforcement, the act of being saved by promises to God *if He just helps us this one time*, is quite realistic. I have seen such instances before, and they are powerful. God uses everything at His disposal to draw us to Himself. Why should high stress situations not be one of those tools? This story had some bad, but a lot of good. While it isn\u2019t as good as Henderson\u2019s *O\u2019Malley* books, it is quite good in and of itself. It also seems to be developing on a similar type of plot trajectory. The characters will be back when one of them features as the main character in a book of his own coming in August. I, for one, cannot wait to get it, and continue this trip with these characters. Recommended. -------I received this novel from B & H Publishing Group for the purposes of writing a review for them.

On the surface (and much to my concern), Deliver Us From Evil feels like it is going to be the same as Rooms - a Christian thriller that forces a reader to explore one's faith. However, Deliver Us From Evil deviates from the focus on faith and instead is a highly informative, more believable suspense. Rather than faith as all-encompassing, the sole purpose of life, Ms. Caroll chooses to present faith as just another viewpoint, as an addition to life rather than its only purpose. This was definitely a welcome change.Deliver Us From Evil is definitely plot-driven; the search for evidence and clues with which to convict the bad guys, the search for the girls, and the burgeoning relationship between Rourk and Brannon made this a quick page-turner. While the plot itself was quite good, unfortunately, I felt that the characters were very one-dimensional and flat. The good were too good, while the bad guys were stereotypically bad - mysoginistic, fastidious to the point of obsessive-compulsive, pompous. The only true evocation of feeling came with the girls, their struggles and their plight. The issue of child trafficking and slavery is very real, and the terror these girls experience was, to me, the most believable in the entire book.I could not help but feel a bit disappointed at the ending; it was a bit too predictable for my preferences. With such a difficult topic, the end result was too tidy, almost too easy. In real life, the reason these trafficking rings continue to flourish is that they are notoriously difficult to capture all participants. The book definitely did not reflect the reality of crime detection, in my opinion.Another point of consternation was the message about women. Several characters express mysogynistic, superior opinions of women - they should not hold positions of power, are good for nothing, are the root of all evil, and so forth. To read these ideas coming from dialogue between the bad guys is one thing; to read similar ideas coming from the good guys is another. Even though a woman is key to the resolution of the story, the reader definitely gets the impression that women are the root cause of all problems too. I am not certain if this was the message Ms. Caroll intended to portray, but it is the message that comes through loud and clear. As I mentioned earlier, the Christian element to this story was more subdued. While there was still Scripture quoting, it was done more as inspirational phrases rather than as heavy morality lessons. Overall, the feeling behind the Christianity presented in this novel was more welcoming, more accepting with less judgment. To be Christian, Ms. Caroll allows the reader to understand that it goes beyond the obviousness of words and actions but is more internal. Since faith, in my opinion, is intensely personal, I could get behind this message.Overall, I have to say I enjoyed reading Deliver Us From Evil. There are enough issues I personally have with the book that I definitely hesitate in recommending it to others unequivocally. However, I do feel that Ms. Caroll should be commended for highlighting an issue which still remains underground more than it should. Hopefully, her novel will help open eyes to child trafficking and generate a dialogue on this horrific crime. I know it did with me."}, {"userName": "Cindy", "userReviewDate": "Sep 02, 2009", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/2695596-cindy", "userReview": "Robin CarrollFebruary 2010B&H FictionFiction/SuspenseReviewed by Cindy LovenBrannon Callahan is a beautiful woman, working in a man's world.

The characters were complete with hangups and flaws as well as expertise, and the chemistry between them, romantic and otherwise, was downright pliable. This is no comfortable little whodunit. There is no \"tada\" at the end when the culprit is discovered. Instead, the reader learns of the identity a little at a time and grows to intensely dislike the person by the time the story reaches the climax. Furthermore, the subject matter made me squirm. I found more than once that I had to stop reading and give my eyes a thorough drying! But then, this type of book isn't supposed to make the reader comfortable. It's supposed to keep the reader on the edge of the seat and Deliver Us From Evil did that for me from the very first page! I also enjoyed learning about some of the research topics that Ms. Caroll shared in the book. She even added Bible Study or Book Study discussion questions to the back of the book and a website research guide for all of her topics! This story really did make me squirm, so I can't really say it was enjoyable. I did like the scripture banter between the protagonist and her friend. I found myself trying to remember the verses before I read them! However, the romance between the two main characters was contrived and very lustful. I found their encounters (kisses, embraces) to be a little cliche, but what led up to the encounters displayed a purely physical relationship. I guess it matched the intensity of the plot, but I was disappointed that there seemed to be nothing between them besides their attraction and heat. It seemed a little out of character for them both."}, {"userName": "Diane  Holm", "userReviewDate": "Apr 13, 2011", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/5261462-diane-holm", "userReview": "Ranger to the Rescue\u2026.Crimes against children are the most heinous and often hidden deep in the criminal underworld.
