Nor are the similarities damning. Yolen says, \"[Wizard's Hall] has got a boy named Henry [who] goes to wizard school, doesn't think he has talent. He has a good friend with red hair. There's a wicked wizard who's trying to destroy the school, and the pictures on the wall move and speak and change.\" That's all she's got? So Bridget Jones' Diary = Pride and Prejudice. And everyone is now stealing from the Twilight series even though vampire mythology has been around since prehistoric times.Ideas are like flowers -- just because one rose resembles another doesn't mean either is a clone. However, none of this gristmill of ridiculous bile makes a damn bit of difference if one tries to take Wizard's Hall as a stand-alone children's book.And, as one, I liked it. Not immensely. But I liked it. I thought of Harry Potter only once, when the main character forgot his wizard's robe in the wardrobe. Otherwise, the clever bits in this book bear only a passing resemblance to the clever bits in Rowling's; and they aren't nearly as well fleshed out.But that's ok. And, in fact, for what I was hoping (I hear it's ok to end a sentence with a preposition these days but I fear Yolen will read this someday and come after me). My son is a prolific reader at age six; he's not ready for the dark, epic themes of Potter. But he can probably handle most of this book (though it does get a little creepy during the final showdown) and for that, I am grateful.This is a quick read with sketchy outlines that are perfect for young readers. Yolen peppers her prose with wisdom, most of it coming in italicized sayings by the main character's \"dear ma,\" like \"Better take care than need care\" and \"Secrets is like wounds, can't be cleansed until opened\" and \"Expectations always disappoint\" and \"Good folk think bad thoughts; bad folk act on 'em\" and, most tellingly for the plot and moral of the book, \"\"Talent don't matter. It only matters that you try.\" With that, she kisses him three times, \"once on each cheek for love and once on the forehead for wisdom ...\" and sends him packing to Wizard's Hall.Yolen engages in some amusing humor; Henry becomes Thornmallow, a name which no one can seem to remember, \"'Thornpillow!' said Magister Hickory. 'Marrow,' corrected Magister Beechvale. 'Mallow,' squeaked Thornmallow.\"And when the kids are in the library, trying to figure out how to defeat the dark wizard, they come upon a solution that seems to easy to Thornmallow. \"'Besides, if we thought of it, why didn't the Magisters?' 'Probably because it is to simple and too easy,' Gorse said. 'Have you ever noticed how grown-ups try to complicate everything? Make it harder than it is? Like grown-up food, with too many sauces.' 'And grown-up clothes, with too many buttons,' added Tansy. 'And grown-up manners,' Will said. 'With too many shoulds and shouldn'ts'\"But this is not an overtly funny book. For me, it was an entertaining confection. But for my kid, it may well be a tome that, with its three great themes, will resonate deeply in his psyche;Words mean somethingWhen the head of the school has confronted the dark wizard and is deflated, he begins to tell a story, \"And clearly, as Magister Hickory spoke, the very act of speaking the words, telling the story, re-creating another time, gave him life. Just as the words spoken by the awful Master had brought him a kind of death.\"The Fine Line\"By 'black,' my prickly friend, I do not mean evil. Or wicked. I mean dark and deep, as in the black water of the deepest lakes. All those strongest of emotions that -- if used improperly -- tempt us to wicked, evil deeds. For example, ambition, which can become greed. Or desire, which can become gluttony. Or admiration, which can become envy. We are all made up of such deep and dark emotions, and as we grow more mature, we learn to control them.\"Always try. Always.And Jane Yolen is overly fond of italics. Just saying."}, {"userName": "Maggie Stiefvater", "userReviewDate": "Sep 14, 2008", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/1246837-maggie-stiefvater", "userReview": "I just picked this one up at the library to reread as I remembered loving it as a kid. It was, in fact, the first novel I ever got a library fine on, as I lost it under my bed for several months.A book that tells the story of a boy wizard succeeding against all odds might sound a bit familiar to you, but Wizard's Hall came long before Harry Potter was ever a twinkle in Voldemort's eye. Told in charming voice reminiscent of Diana Wynne Jones, this quick read is full of dry humor and is a must for anyone who loves the Harry Potter series. ***wondering why all my reviews are five stars?

Rowling had stolen Harry Potter. Jane Yolen was the one author who didn't seem so overtly angry but had simply said \"If Rowling wants to give me part of her profits, I won't say 'no.'\" I thought this was kind of funny and assumed her book would be too. It was not. It was also not good. Yes, I know that it's a kids' book, and I'm in no way claiming that kids couldn't possibly enjoy it. But that's not what makes Harry Potter successful. The Harry Potter series is well thought out, fast paced and gripping. Wizard's Hall seems like it was written in a day. There's very little character development and the plot reads like it was written by someone who knows that events have to keep happening but doesn't know that things also have to happen in between to make the story flow.Yes, the main character is friends with a red-headed boy and a smart girl. Yes, there is some sort of prophecy. But seriously, Harry Potter isn't simply good because it uses the plot conventions of a million other fantasy books and it is annoying to be duped into reading something so very mediocre by generally baseless comparisons."}, {"userName": "Kaye", "userReviewDate": "Jun 07, 2015", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/32478683-kaye", "userReview": "For category: a book with magicI found \"Wizard's Hall\" for fifty cents at a book sale and picked it up simply because I was intrigued by the cover. I had absolutely no idea what it was about (since the back flap came all stickered and unreadable) and no expectations for it, so I was pleasantly surprised when I opened it up and began reading. I fell in love with this little book! It's a lovely story of a charming, reluctant hero whose simple courage and determination win out in the face of powerful magic."}, {"userName": "Maddie", "userReviewDate": "May 05, 2011", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/5005466-maddie", "userReview": "First of all I'd like to say that this not like Harry Potter. The only thing that's the same is that he goes to a wizard school and has to fight an evil wizard, oh, and he has two best friends, but never once during the book did I think, oh, this is kind of like Harry Potter. The writing was good, but everything happened really fast, I felt like I was walking through a whirlwind of information while reading this. Before I continue, I should probably mention that I am prejudiced, I am a huge fan of Harry Potter and I started the book thinking it would similar, I am also a good six years older than the age group this book is aimed at. The writing and story line couldn't compare with Harry Potter. The writing didn't hold as much emotion and the descriptions were a little flat, and, as I mentioned earlier, the plot developed a little fast. But, for the length of the book, I am surprised how well the plot is developed. Also, if you or your child/brother/sister is interested in reading the Harry Potter books, but feel like it might still be too scary, I would recommend starting with this book as it's a quick, easy read, and it has some of the same elements as Harry Potter, like a magic school and an evil wizard, yet different writing style, and the short length, make it not as potentially frightening as the Harry Potter books. As to whatever rumors or drama that is going on that J.K. Rowling stole her idea from this book, it's possible, but other than the most basic ideas, the books are so different that even if J.K. stole the idea, she has taken it and turned it into something that is completely her own."}, {"userName": "Jayaprakash Satyamurthy", "userReviewDate": "Dec 27, 2011", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/1497559-jayaprakash-satyamurthy", "userReview": "Written in a style that reminded me of two of Tolkien's shorter pieces, Farmer Giles Of Ham and Smith Of Wootton Major (stories that I treasure as much as his major epic), Wizard's Hall is a folksy, magical tale of a young boy who arrives, marked by destiny, at a school for wizards. Similarities to Those Books can be found and have been remarked on by Yolen herself. To accuse of her of stretching a point or being filled with bile on this account is itself a case of stretching a point. This little book may not have the soap-operatic density or teen-drama pangs of that series, but it packs in a world of wonder, wisdom and wit into its 130 or so pages and tells a refreshing story of a boy who is not, after all, a great wizard, but is still the one who tilts the scales of destiny in the right direction.

Now he's a wizard who's just discovered that there's an evil heading right for his new school. With this threat to the school, also comes the threat to his new friends. And it's up to Thornmallow to help save the day. But how can he when the most he can seem to do is make messes with his magic?PlotThe plot is very simple: a boy goes to a school to learn magic and he and the school have to deal with an evil wizard. Despite this less than unique basic plot, it\u2019s executed very well, in my opinion. Things aren\u2019t as stereotypical as one would think, and that makes it worth the short read. Things could have been made a bit more exciting, but it\u2019s not a bad plot. WritingThe writing was good. I must admit that there are a lot of lines in the book that are very quotable. But it\u2019s not done in an obtrusive way, like the plot was made around the quotes. The quotes come at very organic moments and that\u2019s what makes them so great. There are some parts where I\u2019d have to read again because the wording was a bit awkward, but those were few and far in between.CharactersI liked the characters, Thornmallow most of all. He had every reason to give up multiple times in the book but he drove on like I\u2019m sure so many of us wish we could do sometimes. The book is more plot-heavy than character-heavy, so the reader only gets a taste of the characters. Things I LikedThe thing I liked best about Wizard\u2019s Hall was how Yolen went about with the \u201cyou must try\u201d theme of the book. I find that a lot of authors and other such content creators, including artists, try to incorporate this into their works and fall very short. In the end it\u2019s some surprise super power that saves the day, not the protagonist actually trying. But Thornmallow succeeded because he tried. Throughout the entire book he tried and though things didn\u2019t always work out he still continued to try. I really liked that. Things I Didn't LikeDespite its short length, Wizard\u2019s Hall feels a bit dull. I love Thornmallow and the theme of the book, but I am eternally grateful Yolen didn\u2019t drag the book out.DiversityThere are a lot of female magisters, and Thornmallow makes friends with two girls, one of whom, Tansy, is black. That\u2019s about it, though. OverallI\u2019d recommend you ignore Yolen\u2019s little joke about Harry Potter being copied from Wizard\u2019s Hall. She even admits that Rowling probably never even read her book and the similarities are just because both books contain common magic tropes. Don\u2019t come into this book thinking it\u2019s anymore like Harry Potter is than Harry Potter is like The Lord of the Rings. Besides that, Wizard\u2019s Hall is a fun little magic book that is very interesting to boot. There\u2019s a good theme in it and Thornmallow is a great protagonist. Here is a link to my notes."}, {"userName": "Ryn", "userReviewDate": "Oct 08, 2010", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/4392763-ryn", "userReview": "'Thornmallow was a wizard, only the most minor of wizards... He was rarely Punctual or Practical and his nose tended toward smudginess. But he meant well. And he tried. ... He came to Wizard's Hall at the time of its greatest peril... And it turned out the inhabitants of Wizard's Hall were glad indeed that Thornmallow studied there. Not because he was the world's greatest wizard. But because he meant well. And he tried.' I'd wanted to read Wizard's Hall ever since I'd discovered it in Grade 9 and exclaimed over how similar it was to Harry Potter. And then, as happens in schools in the wild, the librarian ran away with the book and never returned. And so, months passed and I forgot about the book entirely until around six years later, when it suddenly popped into my head again. Obviously I couldn't remember the title or the author (because that would actually have been helpful, and we couldn't have that!), only that it had to do with Harry Potter and something about- but not necessarily- thorns. Searching the Internet was a fun task. Like getting hypothermia: at first you're in pain, and you just want to survive, but eventually you just lose all feeling and hope for death. Eventually I found it. It wasn't worth the effort. It was a fairy tale. Which is fine. Better than fine! I love fairy tales. But I probably wouldn't have been so frantic to get the book if I'd known it was as thick as my pinky and only half as exciting. So I'm a little disappointed. But the book itself was really... cute! I loved the characters, especially Thornmallow and the teachers, and the moral of the story. It made me kind of miss the good old days when books had clear-cut lessons. Thornmallow wasn't special in any way but that he tried really, really hard. And that made all the difference. There was no prophecy, his dad was never mentioned, his mom was kind of batty (but loving!), and he was poor. Utterly ordinary. And he still defeated the villain. It's the perfect book for young kids, which is the age group it's geared for, so I guess my disappointment is totally unwarranted. Apparently, J.K. Rowling's HP series is a rip-off of this book. It does have some striking similarities: Ron, Dumbledore, Hermione, and, of course, Harry are featured in this book. However, it is a children's fairy tale with only the sketchiest of plots. I like the writing, as well as Yolen's ideas, but it's still only the barest outline of the Harry Potter novels (and other novels involving ordinary boys who find out they're extraordinary, etc.).

He is assigned two other first-year students who are to be his guides until he figures out how to navigate the school.Henry, now named Thornmallow, quickly discovers that he doesn't have any magical talent at all. Because the magic in this particular novel is accomplished through singing, and Thornmallow is tone-deaf, he feels constantly out of place. The only thing that helps him is the mantra he repeats to himself \"I only have to try.\"As the book progresses, Thornmallow and his two friends uncover a threat to the school and are the only students to be let in on the problem that has all of the teachers trembling in fear.

Henry quickly finds that there\u2019s nothing magical about him. His tone deafness keeps him from singing the chants and spells on the dominant thus rendering his efforts ineffectual. Despite this, Thornmallow keeps trying. In fact, his persistence in the face of great adversity saves Wizard\u2019s Hall and everyone in it from certain destruction at the hands of Wizard Nettle and his quilted beast. Henry proves a very likeable character, and Yolen paints him into a wonderful adventure filled with spell-casting wizards. Wizard\u2019s Hall was written eight years before Rowling\u2019s Harry Potter, and, unfortunately, many readers feel a need to compare the two. Such comparison does Wizard\u2019s Hall an injustice."}], "description": "Poor Henry. It\u2019s not enough that his mother has sent him away from home to learn magic. It\u2019s not enough that everyone at his new school calls him Thornmallow because he\u2019s \u201cprickly on the outside, squishy within.\u201d It\u2019s not enough that the only talent he shows at Wizard\u2019s Hall is an ability to make messes of even the simplest spells. Now, when Wizard\u2019s Hall is threatened by a cruel sorcerer\u2019s fearsome beast, it is up to Henry--er, Thornmallow--to figure out how to save not only his new friends but also the entire school for wizards.", "title": "Wizard's Hall", "url": "http://www.goodreads.com/book/show/271060.Wizard_s_Hall", "average": 3.59, "cover": "https://images.gr-assets.com/books/1386921449l/271060.jpg", "reviews": 124, "authors": [{"url": "https://www.goodreads.com/author/show/5989.Jane_Yolen", "name": "Jane Yolen"}], "type": ["Fantasy", "Young Adult", "Fiction", "Childrens", "Childrens"], "outlinks": ["http://www.goodreads.com/book/show/271060.Wizard_s_Hall", "http://www.goodreads.com/book/show/1837906.Wizard_s_Hall", "http://www.goodreads.com/book/show/27419591-wizard-s-hall", "http://www.goodreads.com/book/show/1120868.Wizard_s_Hall", "http://www.goodreads.com/book/show/9810692-wizard-s-hall", "http://www.goodreads.com/book/show/91357.The_Devil_s_Arithmetic", "http://www.goodreads.com/book/show/228696.Owl_Moon", "http://www.goodreads.com/book/show/122125.How_Do_Dinosaurs_Say_Good_Night_", "http://www.goodreads.com/book/show/81153.Briar_Rose", "http://www.goodreads.com/book/show/201054.Dragon_s_Blood"]}
