She is definitely a hardass, but she has her share of problems to keep her from being too much the Strong Female Character\u2122. The narrative takes \"interludes\" that fill in some of the blanks of The Cold Ones, but not too many to get in the way of the pace of the plot. The author has a unique take on the whole zombie phenomenon, although she chooses to parcel it out in maddeningly short sections. I'm definitely looking forward to the next book.If you enjoyed \"The President's Vampire\" by Chris Farnsworth, do yourself a favor and check this series out!"}], "description": "Sara Harvey just wanted to be left alone, listening to the voices of the sea and washing the blood from her hands. But duty calls her back, to a new team still learning to fight the things that go chomp in the night. They will give Sara one more mission, one way to quiet the voices, one chance at redemption. It should have been nothing, a minor problem on the dark cobblestone wharf in Memphis. But long-quiet voices return, and the evil Sara thought she defeated returns to claim still more of those she leads. The Cold Ones are rising again, and in their path, no one is safe. The dead know no peace - and they are coming for Sara Harvey.", "title": "Blackfire", "url": "http://www.goodreads.com/book/show/10930732-blackfire", "average": 4.56, "cover": "https://images.gr-assets.com/books/1348666594l/10930732.jpg", "reviews": 1, "authors": [{"url": "https://www.goodreads.com/author/show/250327.Elizabeth_Donald", "name": "Elizabeth Donald"}], "type": ["Horror"], "outlinks": ["http://www.goodreads.com/book/show/10930732-blackfire", "http://www.goodreads.com/book/show/1799494.Nocturne", "http://www.goodreads.com/book/show/445214.Setting_Suns", "http://www.goodreads.com/book/show/9818065-the-cold-ones", "http://www.goodreads.com/book/show/8298420-nocturnal-urges", "http://www.goodreads.com/book/show/5790907-abaddon"]}
