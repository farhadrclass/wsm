After reading some crazy angst-filled books, I needed something sweet, sexy and light on the drama and I knew her newest read would fit the bill. I was right. Listen to Me was just the book I needed.Addison Wade is a co-owner of Seduction (a hot new restaurant) with her four best friends. Addie is a sucker for the bad boy and always chooses the wrong guy. It\u2019s her thing. When Jake Keller comes to audition for her restaurant, they\u2019re hiring a musician, she knows she needs to stay far, far away. Jake is just the type of guy that she's always gone for and that type of guy is 100% trouble. The thing is, Jake isn\u2019t really the way she thinks he is. And he\u2019s hard to resist. Jake Keller was a very successful musician, but five years ago he walked away from it all. Now he spends his time producing music and out of the limelight. He has his reasons. He hasn\u2019t been in a serious relationship in a while, but when he meets Addie, he knows he has to have her. And she\u2019s not the kind of girl he can just be with a few times. He wants her completely. \n\u201cI need someone who calls me out on my bullshit. I need someone who sees the fire in my eyes and wants to play with it, not try to extinguish it. I need someone who challenges me; in the bedroom, in my career, in my crazy head. And you know what? I found all of that in you.\u201d\n\u2028I loved both Jake and Addie. Neither were perfect and both had some hang ups from past relationships and issues, but they were great together. The mistakes they made I completely understood and weren\u2019t over the top and didn\u2019t take away from their love story. Kristen Proby always writes with heart. Her stories are always heartwarming, funny, sexy and sweet. I really love that I know what to expect when I read one of her books and am rarely disappointed. This book was a promising start to a new series- all of the characters intrigued me and I can\u2019t wait to read more of these stories! Bring on Cami and Landon and their best friends brother story!!!"}, {"userName": "Patty Belongs To Kellan~Jesse~Lautner~Miller~Jack~Racer~Rafe~Liam~Prince Nicholas~Hayes~Simon~Gianluca & Archer", "userReviewDate": "Nov 20, 2015", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/14302918-patty-belongs-to-kellan-jesse-lautner-miller-jack-racer-rafe-liam-prince", "userReview": "*****FOUR STARS*****{ARC Provided by Edelweiss}\nThis is a brand new series by Kristen Proby that centers around five girlfriends who co-own the hottest new restaurant in Portland called Seduction. Their restaurant offers the most delicious food with a sexy ambiance. Each friend will get their own romantic story. This first installment is about Addie. She is the Manager of the restaurant. Addie was a model at one time but left because she didn\u2019t want to live her life always watching what she eats. She also has huge abandonment issues stemming from her dysfunctional relationship with her parents and her poor choices in boyfriends. Addie is normally drawn to the bad boy musicians, who always end up breaking her heart in the end. The story opens with Addie catching her current \u201cbad boy\u201d having sex with two women in her apartment, proving yet again to her that she is incapable of being loved by a man.Jake Knox was the lead singer of the group Hard Knox. The band broke up a few years ago due to a personal tragedy. Jake has given up performing but he has been writing songs and producing them for other artists. After three years of not performing he decides to go to an open mic night and that\u2019s where he and Addie cross paths. He\u2019s instantly attracted to her and she happens to be at the club looking for a musician to perform at Seduction on the weekends. He ends up getting the job and eventually after some persistent flirting, he gets Addie to go out with him. From there the relationship starts to get hot and heavy. But all the while Addie tries to withhold her heart from Jake because she is positive he will end up annihilating her in the end.It took me a while to warm up to this story. It seemed a bit slow in the beginning and I literally lost count as to how many times Jake called Addie, \u201dBEAUTIFUL\u201d!! I couldn\u2019t stop rolling my eyes. It wasn\u2019t until he makes an ass of himself and jeopardizes the relationship that I started to get engrossed in the story. Plus the sexy times are pretty steamy.I really enjoyed the bits we get of the next couple in the series. It will be a \u201dFriends to Lovers\u201d romance and the hero is the best friend's older brother!! Right up my alley!!! I\u2019m still very optimistic about this series and can\u2019t wait for book two."}, {"userName": "Sabrina", "userReviewDate": "Feb 07, 2015", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/18085807-sabrina", "userReview": "NOW LIVE!!!*Amazon US*Amazon UK*Barnes & Noble*Kristen Proby has done it again! This is just yet another amazing book from her, and a great start to a new series. The Fusion series is about five, very different, friends that open a restaurant together and navigate through life, always being there for one another. Truly a spectacular story.Listen to Me focuses mainly on Addison Wade, proud part owner of Seduction, and the person who has to look for a musician to play at the restaurant on weekends. Her search leads her to an open mic night where she sees Jake Keller aka Jake Knox, former rockstar perform. Jake left the limelight five years ago after a tragic accident that he blames himself for. But he misses being able to get up and perform for people, and writing songs for other artist just isn't the same as singing them himself. His best friend urges him to go to Seduction and ask for the musician spot, and when he does he spots Addie, the girl he saw on open mic night and wanted to know more about. But Addie has dealt with the bad boy rockstars in the past and she's done with dating musicians - or so she thinks. I've actually had this books on my Kindle for awhile and I'm kicking myself for not reading it sooner. I loved meeting all the new characters that we'll get to read about in this series. The book told us a lot about the friends but not too much that it took away from the main characters and their story. Oh and we got some mentions of Leo Nash!I loved Jake and Addie as characters, and didn't have any issue's with them throughout the book. Usually there will be at least something that bugs me about a character but with them I just loved everything. They were very real and there was nothing fake about them. I thought they were really well developed characters and KP gave us enough information from their pasts to keep them interesting, but not too much that we got sucked into a past story that didn't have relevance to the book, which can happen sometimes. There was a little bit of drama near the end that I could have done without, but it didn't make me hate Jake or Addie. By the time the book ended I had mostly forgotten about it, and was back to loving the story.Bottom line, this was a great story and I can't wait for everyone to get to read it. The ending wasn't a cliffhanger but it did hint at the next book and will make you want that story ASAP, so be prepared.ARC kindly provided via Edelweiss in exchange for an honest review."}, {"userName": "Coco.V", "userReviewDate": "Apr 16, 2015", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/42214962-coco-v", "userReview": "Kristen Proby has delivered another winner with Listen to me !I have been a huge fan of Kristen Proby since her first book of the amazing With Me Series. Since then I devoured and loved every-single-one of her books ! And this one is no exception. She\u2019s a wonderful story teller and you can help to fall in love with all her characters. She creates the perfect mix of heart and heat I love in romance.Listen to Me is book one in the Fusion series. The story is about former rock star Jake Keller and Addison Wade co-owner with four of her best friends of the hottest new restaurant in Portland, Seduction. I enjoyed everything in this book. I loved Jake and Addie\u2019s relationship and the teasing banter between them. Their chemistry is incredible and not just in the bedroom. When they are together the atmosphere is so alluring and electric.If you already know Kristen Proby's all kinds of awesome male characters, you will not be disappointed with Jake. He\u2019s sexy, sweet, funny, charming with an edge and has a delicious dirty mouth. The same for her female characters, they are always awesome women. Addie is beautiful, strong, driven, independant and feisty. One of the many things I like about this author is her ability to develop attaching characters whose stories make you feel intensely.Behind Jake\u2019s rock star image and Addie\u2019s cool and composed professional fa\u00e7ade, you get to see their strengths and weaknesses, their insecurities, their fears and hopes which help to become emotionally invested in their journey. They both have issues they are dealing with and find comfort and friendship in each other. Addie and Jake both have such depth in their personalities. I also loved the amazing supporting characters. Addie and her four best friends Cami, Mia, Kat, and Riley are family. They are fiercely loyal and protective. Jake also has a strong and solid relationship with his best friends Cristina and her husband Mike, and Max. Jake and Addie both have the love and support of true good friends.This story has it all, some ups and downs, a little angst, funny and emotional moments, entertaining banters, friendship, passion, romance and love. All that and so much more! Highly recommended. Can\u2019t wait to read Close to You, Cami and Landon\u2019s story."}, {"userName": "Catarina", "userReviewDate": "Aug 26, 2014", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/11538033-catarina", "userReview": "[ Yes.

Since they opened six months ago, their restaurant has been gaining in popularity. To help bring in even more customers they decide to hire a musician to come and play on the weekends. They had no idea that a former rock god would walk into their front door looking for a job. He's set his sights on Addison and isn't pulling any punches, but she's been burned one too many times by musicians and she's not about to go down that road again. I was really excited to read Listen to Me. It has everything that I love in a good romance. It's got a successful woman, humor, a celebrity, and of course romance. However, this story just lacked depth. You read about all these people but they were just background noise. I could never remember her friends/co-owners names or who they were. Plus, I found the romance to be really cheesy. I mean, Jake walks into Seduction to apply for a job and once he's given a time/day for an audition he immediately starts hitting on Addison. There were even moments where he told one of her friends that she had really beautiful hair and the internal dialogue goes on to say how he wasn't hitting on her, he's just nice to everyone. What?! It's not that Jake was a sleeze-ball or anything but the characters just lacked so much depth and development that everything the voice for the whole book was pretty monotone.

It is again one of those very uneventful sweet love stories. It didn't make me feel much, I mean, sometimes light and sweet love stories can become one of my favorite reads but this wasn't one of them. I didn't find it special. There isn't much to the story other than Addison, having abandonment issues and thus having reservations towards him and Jake, feeling guilty of the terrible thing that happened to his best friend which resulted in him falsely assuming that he somehow caused it and he is bad for the ones he loves.While the two of them struggle between their mutual attraction and their personal demons, the story progresses very slowly. There are \"sweet, funny, emotional and hot\" moments but I must say that I mostly got bored, knowing it wouldn't go anywhere interesting. There is no angst, no sexual tension built up, no interesting story line, etc... To cut it short, it is a decent read nothing else to criticize about other than its sort of clich\u00e9, uneventful and slow story line.Some dialogues from the book...\n\u201cAll you had to say was I miss you, Addie. \u201d I snort. \u201cI just saw you.\u201d \u201cYou missed me,\u201d she repeats confidently.

I can't rave about it and name it a new favourite, but it was a book that had good elements and bad elements to it. I was frustrated in some parts but giddily smiling at others. I want to point out the major positives first: We had some kick ass characters. Addison and her close group of friends had established a business which highlighted each of their degrees from college. They were all such strong women who supported each other, always being there and never belittling one another. It was inspiring considering kickass female characters like that tend to be rare in fiction. I loved the fact that Addison stood up for herself as well, she could take care of herself and her friends. Jake was a character I didn't like as much as Addison. He was a tad whiny, obsessed with Addison, and was always blaming himself. It got slightly frustrating. Though, it was nice to have a male character who wasn't some alpha asshole who got jealous over ever single thing. At one stage in the book Addison is joking with a guy she dated in high school and Jake doesn't get crazy jealous and annoyed (thank the lord himself). I also loved Jake's platonic relationship with Christina, I'm so sick of seeing boy/girl relationships which always develop into something more why can't two people of opposite genders just be friends? I obviously had some problems with this book, hence the rating it received. For most of the book I was leaning towards a 4 star review, but the ending dropped it right down to 3. And now 2, the more I think about it. About a 2.5 actually. I didn't like how short the book was. I felt there was barely time to get to know the characters before the book was over. It didn't take me that long to read it ultimately, so I'm just frustrated that the writing wasn't full of quality. The ending also felt rushed. I didn't like the pointless drama between Addison and Jake so close to the end. It was pointless and there was no need to it. I swear, books always throw a problem in right before the end in order to make it interesting. In my case? It makes me bored. I also felt some problems were left hanging e.g Addison and her parents etc. I didn't really care for the cliffhanger ending either really. There also wasn't much of a plot. It was purely romance centred (which if you've read enough of my reviews it's obvious I hate that). I was hoping for more substance as the story continued but I got nothing of the sort. This review is slightly scattered, but my thoughts on this book are slightly scattered. I liked it, but I also hated it which makes it hard to be fair when reviewing. If the premise of this book interests you I would recommend it, but otherwise I probably wouldn't due to the ultimate cheese fest for the rest of the book."}, {"userName": "Gretchen  (About That Story)", "userReviewDate": "Sep 28, 2015", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/3733940-gretchen-about-that-story", "userReview": "6 stars! This was incredible! Perfection. Loved the story and characters so much. It was entertaining, witty, and sexy. It was my first Kristen Proby book and I feel like I need to apologize to her for being late to the game because seriously, I have been missing out.There was nothing about this I didn't enjoy. It was an absolute joy to read. At 10% I had a really good feeling. At 20% I was thinking it was pretty darn perfect and it just got better and better from there. Jake and Addie were so real to me and they had the best banter, so fun and playful. And oh man Jake, talk about a guy who gives great flirt. Totally swoon worthy! I loved Addie's wit, and how smart and determined she was. I loved the build between the two of them. Sexy and fun and flirty and hot... then really, really hot! ;-) Besides the fun and sexy, there's a lot of emotion happening as they open up. I thought they had a beautiful story.This was just so extremely well written and developed. Loved all the characters and how they played into everything. Addie's friends and business partners each have great personalities that really shine through. Getting to know them makes me super excited for their stories. I am so completely pulled in. Those girls together are priceless! Jake\u2019s friends were great too. Loved their interactions and the healing process Jake went enough with them for past issues. The end had my heart in my throat, caught up in the moment and emotion. I was in this weird place where I couldn't read it fast enough but at the same time, I didn't want it to end. It was just an amazingly well rounded story with great details and bits of whimsy throughout. I don't give many 6 star review but this one, right from that very first chapter, I was all in, thinking it just doesn't get better than this. But it did! Every single moment of it I was 100% invested and I completely caught up in everything. I just kept thinking to myself, this, THIS is awesome. Seriously, this is a MUST READ. I highly recommended it.

You become extremely addictive to the plot and characters and you begin to want to know more about this universe she built within her books.I enjoyed so much The Boudreaux Series and last week I actually wanted something light and funny to keep me up all night, so I chose another one of her series to see if it does the trick for me again. It actually worked, because I am planning to continue the series.So, \"Listen to Me\" is the first book from The Fusion Series and here we meet Jake and Addie, 2 extremely different characters who try to leave their pasts and fears behind in order to start over.Addie had a lot of bad luck in love, experiencing broken heart issues mainly with artists/ musicians. After dozens of this episodes, she finally learns a lesson and try to not mingle with this type of men. So she is determined to ignore the gorgeous Jake that wants to play in her fancy restaurant \"Seduction\". Jake is not in the spotlight anymore, but his love for music is still very much alive. When Addie gives him the opportunity to continue doing what he loves in her restaurant, he is there in a second, but also extremely attracted to her.\u00a0You know what I liked about the characters? They were very easy to relate to and normal. They didn't have a complex past, with tragic things that had to be discovered. Addie had trust issues, beginning with her love life and ending with her parents, and this made her vulnerable and very hard to trust someone again completely. Jake made some mistakes in his life and payed the consequences, and because of a certain period in his life, he believed that he couldn't be loved, that everybody around him gets hurt. He also stop singing and focused more on producing, but his mind was constantly at his first love. They will learn to trust each other, to leave their past behind and open their hearts in order to have a future together.\u00a0 \u00a0This book is perfect if you want something sexy, adorable, light and funny. I like the focus Kristen puts on family and friends, on unity and trust. It is very important while reading a book to have good examples of friendship, of a good environment, because in this way you can aspire to have it in your life as well. I think that by default, you will like to be closer to your friends, to be more successful, to follow your dreams and pursue a goal. It made me more ambitious and showed me how normal people can manage something through ambition and dedication.\u00a0I loved the good vibe this book gave me and this encouraged me to continue this series, because there are a lot of characters there that are worthy and I'll think they will provide us with excellent stories down the road.\u00a04 stars!For more reviews please check https://readwithloveblog.wordpress.com"}, {"userName": "Ezinwanyi", "userReviewDate": "Mar 20, 2016", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/4386752-ezinwanyi", "userReview": "This audiobook was well narrated and engaging. I listened to it fairly quickly as the story was smooth and flowed really well.Addison Wade and four other friends owned a restaurant called Seduction together. In order to add more flavor to their establishment, they decided to hire a singer to perform there. During auditions, Jake Keller, former lead singer of a defunct boy band, performed a song and made an impression. He was eventually hired to play at Seduction.Jake made his interest in Addison known fairly quickly, but Addison who had a pennant for bad boy rockers tried her best to resist him. Eventually, Jake wore her down and they began dating.The story was told using a Dual Point of View so we could spend equal time in Jake and Addy\u2019s head. They were both working out past issues that were added weight to their new blossoming relationship. Addison used to be a model but was now considered too curvy. Jake had overcome addiction and now worked hard to remain sober and present in his new reality. They were both really likable characters and their respective friends added a nice supporting cast to this love story. I can\u2019t say the story was dissimilar to books in this genre but it was entertaining nonetheless. I couldn\u2019t put it down because I really connected with Addison and loved Jake as a hero too. They were flawed characters but they were so relatable and delightful. Addison felt like a person everyone knows and cares about. You can only hope they would find their Jake someday. It hit all the right chords within me. I had a great time reading this book.It was pretty low on angst but there was still an emotional pull towards the main characters. I had read this author once before and it was just an okay experience. But this story was more developed and the characters had more depth.

I love your chaos, sweetheart.\u201d \n\n Addison Wade together with her five best friends owns Seduction, a very up and coming restaurant in Portland. And to make sure their restaurant pleases all of their customers\u2019 senses, they\u2019ve decided that live music is just what they need. But when Jake Keller, who used to be famous rock star, applies for the position, Addie knows she\u2019s in trouble. Jake is perfect for their restaurant but everything about him tells Addie he\u2019s bad news. Her penchant for bad boy musicians has only brought pain for her in the past and she\u2019s not about to make the same mistake again. No matter how sexy and charming Jake is.  Jake walked away from what he loves most five years ago. The rock star life brought out the worst in him, and he knows he will never go back to being that person. But he misses playing in front of people and when he gets the opportunity to play at Seduction, he sees it as his chance to get back the part of his life he misses. And working for the sassy and beautiful Addie makes it even better. Now if only he can convince her to give him a chance on more than just working for her.  \n \u201cYou scare me a little,\u201d she admits softly.\u201cYou scare me a lot,\u201d I reply with a grin. \u201cI think that if it wasn\u2019t scary it wouldn\u2019t mean as much.\u201d \n But what will happen when Jake\u2019s past comes back to haunt him? Will he have broken through Addie\u2019s walls only to hurt her like all the others in her past has?  \nThis man is potent.Dangerous.So fucking hot.\u201cSeriously, Jake, I am not having sex with you.\u201d\u201cSeriously, Addie, I am not even attracted to you. Stop trying to have sex with me.\u201d\n I really liked Addie, her confidence, her love of fashion and her take charge attitude. Even though Addie was attracted to Jake right from the start, she didn\u2019t want to be. She\u2019s always had a weak spot for bad boys and musicians, but she\u2019s been burned by them so many times and with Jake being a musician and his wild past she\u2019s too afraid to believe it would be different with him.  \n \u201cAddie, you\u2019re a grown woman. Of course you\u2019ve had life experiences that have broken your heart, made you guarded. I don\u2019t need someone with a spotless heart. Give me someone who\u2019s been through some shit, who\u2019s had to pick herself up, dust herself off, and get on with it.\u201d \n Jake was such a great hero. He\u2019s made a lot of mistakes in his past, but he\u2019s not that guy anymore. I loved his intense reaction to Abbie right from the start, how he couldn\u2019t keep his eyes off of her.  \n \u201cIt may have taken me a while to break through some of your walls, but here we are. You\u2019re wild about me.\u201d\u201cI tolerate you,\u201d she replies with a smile in her voice.\u201cStop fawning. It\u2019s embarrassing.\u201d \n I like the slow burn of their romance and their banter was so funny and sweet. I\u2019m not a fan of angst, but I really enjoyed the drama near the end. Both Addie and Jake has issues which made them react badly at certain points, but it added depth and a sense of real to their relationship. And I love that Addie didn\u2019t just forgive Jake easily, she actually gave him a hard time and it felt refreshing and so true to the person she is, after all the hurt she experienced from her parents and the losers she dated before. Also, Jake did some good grovelling, which I really liked.  I love this author\u2019s writing, the way she blends the sweetness with the sexiness and all the feelings. And the friendships she writes, whether it\u2019s between siblings like her Boudreaux series or friends like this series, it\u2019s all amazing. She captures their loyalty and closeness perfectly and I loved Addie and her friends in this book. I can\u2019t wait to read the next book.

Kristen Proby does it again!Addison Wade and her four best friends are the co-owners of hot new restaurant, Seduction. They are an incredibly close-knit group and they work hard to make their restaurant the huge success that it is. But despite her business success as the restaurant\u2019s Manager, Addie has had nothing but bad luck when it comes to relationships. Her ex-boyfriends have been bad boy musicians, and most of them have treated her badly, leaving her broken hearted. Her latest break up is more of the same and she is determined to stay away from her usual type of men in the future. When the girls decide to bring on a musical act for their weekend customers, they end up hiring Jake Keller \u2013 formerly known as Jake Knox, lead singer of rock band Hard Knox. Five years ago Jake\u2019s band broke up and he retired from performing and is now a sought-after producer. But he misses the stage, and weekend gigs at a restaurant are just what he needs to satisfy his love of performing.From the very first moment, Jake makes his attraction to Addie known. He is smooth and confident with a great sense of humour, and I love his cocky charm as he pursues her \u2013 especially the scene where he overhears her talking about her perfect guy\u2026 \n\u201cI'm taller than you, you know. And I have tats. I know that wasn't a deal breaker, but it's a bonus.\u201d I shake my head.\u201cI have brown hair, but I could lighten it. And I think you settled on blue eyes, but I heard green mentioned, and...bingo.\u201d He bats his eyes at me and before I know what's happening, he lifts the hem of his shirt.Oh, sweet Jesus.\u201cAnd I'm not the one to brag, but, abs.\u201d \nAddie\u2019s pain over her failed relationships is still fresh so she does her best to push Jake away, but the man is persistent. And as he makes his case, proving that he\u2019s actually a good guy who wants something meaningful with her, she is powerless to resist - and the joking, teasing and banter is fantastic!\nHoly mother of God, that feels good. \u201cI\u2019m not having sex with you,\u201d I say primly and try to inch away from him. \u201cI didn\u2019t invite you to. Stop squirming.\u201d He nuzzles my neck, making my eyes cross, and continues to play my stomach like a freaking guitar. Then he pushes more firmly against me, making me giggle. \u201cWhatever it is that\u2019s pressed to my ass disagrees with you.\u201d\u201cThat\u2019s nothing. Just a flashlight.\u201d I burst out laughing. \u201cDo you carry a flashlight in your pocket often?\u201d\u201cMostly just in the morning,\u201d he replies seriously and kisses my neck, right under my ear.\nI love this relationship! The fun, sweet moments are perfectly woven in with the steamy passion and deep emotion that grows between Addie and Jake. Their chemistry is undeniable (in and out of the bedroom\u2026 whew!), and there is lots of time spent with them getting to know each other, growing close and falling hard.\n\u201cI need someone who calls me out on my bullshit. I need someone who sees the fire in my eyes and wants to play with it, not try to extinguish it. I need someone who challenges me; in the bedroom, in my career, in my crazy head. And you know what? I found all of that in you.\u201d\u201cI know that our love isn\u2019t perfect, Addie. But I do know that I will fight for us.\u201d\nBut with all of their baggage, of course there is the inevitable drama, but it serves a purpose in allowing Addie and Jake to figure out what they want and where their hearts truly lie, and I enjoyed the build-up as they worked to sort out their issues.\n\u201cAddie, I can\u2019t promise you that there won\u2019t be times I fuck up or that things won\u2019t ever feel broken.\u201d His voice is a shaky whisper, his mouth planted against my temple. \u201cBut I can promise you that I will never walk away from us.\u201d Us.

But each installment will build upon the characters introduced here with each book centered on a new couple and their own story. High fives for the \u201cnatural\u201d and \u201cfeel good\u201d covers for this book and the next one. I was immediately drawn to both. I liked the premise and enjoyed this story. It was an \"ok\" read but nothing extraordinary or new \u2013 just what you would expect with a brooding rocker and a girl who has been cast aside by those she\u2019s loved too many times. On the positive side, the interaction between the close friends and partners in business is solid and very realistically written. They appeared responsible and willing to work hard to succeed. Their friendship offered lots of wit and sassy dialogue and a few too many bottles of wine shared as they offered helping hands and shoulders to cry on at all the appropriate times.One complaint that kept this just a \u201cmeh\u201d read is that, although Addison and Jake were older and supposedly wiser with age and established careers, I found their relationship a bit on the juvenile side. Taking advice from the title of their book might have helped their situation if they had only listened to each other. Again, it\u2019s that ongoing and never-ending misunderstood breakup circle. They simply don\u2019t converse with one another on items of importance to their relationship. A decision is made by one party or the other thinking they know what's best for everyone involved without talking out the problems or confirming their reasoning with the so-called guilty party. Even so, the drama is light with nothing shockingly frightful or that will send you into days of depression. Predictable but still emotional and downright hot!A light and easy music-related sexy pick-me-up read. There are definitely a few places where your heartstrings will feel well-strummed!

Overall, I really enjoyed this book. It\u2019s a pretty light read and not packed with dramatics. The heroine is someone all females can relate to and the hero is one hot man with whom we can all fall in love with. He (Jake) is a tattooed musician and she (Addison) is a sweet, strong, caring, and easily likeable. So why did I decide to read this one? Well, I bought this book on a whim at my local bookstore when I saw it standing on the new release display and was immediately drawn to the cover. Once I read the blurb a few times (to make sure it was really going to be something I would enjoy) I decided to go ahead and purchase a copy. Well, I am so glad I did and I certainly plan to read the rest of the series as they are released. Normally I won\u2019t pick up these books in paperback, especially when I am not too familiar with the author, but in this case I am glad I did and will happily display it as one of my favorites on my book shelf. So yes, I highly recommend this read. It\u2019s really great! This story is about Addison who is a partial owner of a new restaurant called Seduction. She and four of her best friends (who will each receive their own story in this series) are doing really well business wise but to add a bit more spice to their restaurant they decide to hire a musician to play on the weekends. So when Addison goes to a local club on open mic night to find someone who will fit she is immediately drawn to the smooth voice and killer looks of Jake Keller (aka Knox). But then she realizes that he used to be in a band that all her friends have fangirled over. At first Addison wants nothing to do with this because she knows how rock stars are and doesn\u2019t want to be involved in the dramatics. But once she gets to know him her views start to change. And the cocky yet completely charming Jake begins to make a big difference in her life. But can Addison get over his bad boy image and the fact that he is a former rockstar? You\u2019ll have to read to find out!Fans of the author will definitely want to start out this all new series. Even those who love a sweet romance with some very SPICY scenes. I enjoyed it immensely and I can\u2019t wait until August when book 2 comes out (which will feature a different BFF/couple). Is this one highly recommend? YES!

He hasn\u2019t been on stage ever since, preferring the safety and anonymity of the recording studios to the limelight.

I liked both Addison and Jake, even though they both had issues. Their story was enjoyable and I'm looking forward to continuing the series.Addison is co-owner of a popular restaurant, along with her 4 BFFs. Addison grew up with parents that didn't pay her much attention and still don't (which hurts her even though she tries to ignore it). Addison hasn't had much luck with men...she tends to be into bad-boy musicians who cheat on her and then leave her. All Addison really wants is someone that will show her some love, not cheat on her and make her a priority in their life.Jake used to be the lead for a popular band. While with the band, Jake was a man whore and started getting into some bad stuff, including drugs. After Jake's BFF, Christina, got in a serious accident (which he blamed himself for) he quit the band and decided he'd prefer to produce music and write songs for other musicians. He's been out of the band for 5 years and he's happy with his business but he's still missing something.The restaurant the Addison and her friends own, Seduction, is doing well but they decide that they want to bring in live music on Friday and Saturday nights. Addison goes to an open mic night to try to find someone and sees Jake there but doesn't approach him. Christina is convinced that Jake needs to play music again so she convinces him to go to an open mic night just so he can play. After he performs in front of a crowd, jake realizes that he misses it, even if he still doesn't want to rejoin a band and do tours and such. Christina had seen a sign at Seduction about them looking for a musician so she suggests that he go and apply. Jake does and when he sees Addison, he's definitely interested in getting to know her better. Unfortunately, when Jake first shows up, Addison is just breaking up with her latest cheating boyfriend so she's not exactly receptive to Jake, no matter how strong the attraction is between them.Jake starts singing at the restaurant 2 nights a week but it takes a while for him to get Addison to give him the time of day. Once they do finally come together, it takes some effort for Jake to get Addison to fully trust him and let him in past her walls. Once she does, they find that their blooming relationship isn't perfect (they both still make mistakes) but is still great and something they both want to continue. Unfortunately, Jake has some personal issues as well and when they hit, he has a huge bout of relationship dumbassedness and he ends up causing much drama and pain for them both. Things look bad for a while and Addison certainly makes Jake work for it but they eventually work things out and end the story starting a HEA together.This was a pretty enjoyable story. I liked Addison for the most part but she tended to blame Jake for the sins of other men which annoyed me at times. Jake was a good hero. He did have that bout of relationship dumbassedness but he got past it and then was willing to do the work to make up for his idiocy so I liked him. My main complaint is that I wasn't thrilled with how long the drama between them was drawn out but overall, I liked the story and plan to read the next book in the series. I'd recommend this book. :)* note - I listened to the audio version of this book. It had 2 narrators, a female for the chapters from Addison's PoV and a male for the chapters from Jake's PoV. I thought both narrators did a very good job."}, {"userName": "Pavlina Read more sleep less blog\u2764\u2764  ", "userReviewDate": "Nov 20, 2015", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/6603203-pavlina-read-more-sleep-less-blog", "userReview": "4 STARS I've been wanting to try this author's work out for awhile now, and after having had the opportunity to read an ARC of Listen To Me, I'm happy to say that I liked this refreshing story!

Listen to Me focuses mainly on Addison one of the owners, where she goes to a open mic night to find a musician for her restaurant. Jake is a musician who no longer performs after breaking up with his band. He is perfect for their restaurant and maybe for Addison too.
