I'm a full-on idiot. I (because reading the blurb is for losers!) thought that the title was some kind of catchy metaphorical shit. Like, they were girls whose young emotions were as thin as paper. Or instead of paper dolls they were paper girls. You know, something along those lines.For some reason, it never occurred to me that this was about a bunch of girls with a paper route. Probably because that one chick on the cover has a cigg dangling from her lips, making me think they were a tad older than your average kid on a bike tossing the Times at your porch. But since we all knew that kid in middle school who was a little more 'advanced' than the rest of us, I should've known better. My bad.So. They're actual Paper Girls.And now that that's out of the way, I feel I should tell you that this story doesn't have anything to do with their respective paper routes.Nope. This is all about interdimensional time travel.Whoo-hoo!Or not...depending on how you feel about a middle school version of Dr. Who.This seems to be a hit or miss title with my friends, and from what I can tell, it looks like most of the complaints center around all the sci-fi whatthefuckery that happens with little to no explanation. Plus, you've gotta translate some of what this one person says. I mean, the other guys sound normal, but the crazy chick that's hunting them down for unknown reasons?Wez timetravlrs! Goona kilz yu! <--not a real quote, btwWithout any real reference point for some of this stuff, I can see how this volume might come across as too wonky and out there to enjoy. So, for those of you who didn't care for this, I can totally see where you're coming from.But.And here's where being a full-on idiot comes in handy: I accidentally read the 2nd volume first, so I knew where everything was headed.Ta-da!Can't nobody tell me being a moron don't have its advantages...Ok, you see the tiny little 1 & 2 underneath the title on those two covers in the image below? Well, I didn't. I had both of them sitting on my kitchen table and just grabbed the one I thought was the 1st volume and headed out to the park with my girls. And while they ran around getting wet in the splash pad and falling off of the top of the playground equipment, I read a very interesting graphic novel. I mean, sure I thought it was odd that I was kinda plopped down into the middle of a story, but I assumed there would be a flashback at some point to explain. Turns out there was a flashback sequence...it was called Paper Girls: volume 1.What I'm trying to say is that I had a distinct advantage going into this. I already knew what some of the (seemingly) nonsense stuff was leading towards, so it didn't have me scratching my head the way it did some of my friends. Even so, this volume didn't blow my mind. I liked all the 80's references and the timey-wimey stuff, but Cliff Chang's art isn't really my jam. *whispers* Please don't hurt me...please don't hurt me...please don't hurt me...He's super-talented & I know a lot of you love his style, so don't think that I'm trying to put him down as an artist. I'm not. And it doesn't make my eyes bleed to look at it or anything, but it's not something that makes me personally want to keep turning the pages just to look at the pictures.However, since I've already read (and liked!) volume 2, I'm pretty invested in some of these characters and I'd like to see where this story takes them."}, {"userName": "Raeleen Lemay", "userReviewDate": "Jun 17, 2017", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/3452652-raeleen-lemay", "userReview": "As a lover of the \"Sci Fi weirdness hits a group of kids\" trope (big fan of Super 8 and Stranger Things over here) this was AWESOME!

SO PLEASING, SO PROMISING.But agh.Mr. Vaughan, I'm afraid you've set the bar way too high after Saga. While Paper Girls certainly stands out in the world of comics, with a vibrant spectacle of colours and rich atmosphere, it definitely isn't the best this man's got to offer.Other than lack of a smooth-running plot, this story's fallout lay in its dialogue for me. And by that I mean the fact that nearly 20% of it is either in a language we don't understand or some really bad ghetto Shakespeare. I'm sure there's a translation lurking about in the interwebs somewhere but it only serves to be supremely off-putting when you're lost reading in the middle it.Back to the roughly handled plotline. The story? Great. Not mind-blowing, not whoa-inducing, but still great. It manages to capture the quick paced, compact structure every comic books needs to win an audience, but not without its stumbles along the way. Too much infodump in too little time and what we're left with is confuddling chaos.As for the characters? Meh. That's all they made me feel and that's all I've got to say about them. Sure, there were two or three interesting turn of events thrown at us and some insanely lush artwork to boot too (big hats off to Cliff Chiang and Matthew Wilson!) But in the end, these girls and this world seem just as flat as paper.Final rating: 2.75 stars.P.S.

Having read the existing subsequent volumes, I like this crazy first volume even more than I originally did! June, 2016: I just read this for the first time in March 2016, and reread it again for my summer YA GN class. One woman in class said she liked it better than Ms. Marvel, Vol. 1, (G. Willow Wilson version) because the girls in this story swore more. :) Oh, they all swear in Vaughn novels, I said. They do feel a bit more \"real\" for that, I suppose. The comic is edgier than Kamala Khan (Ms. Marvel), in some ways: Kamala is more wholesome and idealistic than the girls in Paper Girls., but they are all fun. I liked reading it through better a second time, but I still want to know more about what is going on. I will eagerly read on as the sixth issue comes out soon.Initial review, 3/16: I had read the floppies for much of this first volume, but was excited to read it all in one sitting. Vaughn is a terrific writer of dialogue, clever, smart-ass, and he loves to have at least a couple foul-mouthed characters in the mix, and sure, they sound like a lot of Vaughn characters, but who cares, he is one of the best ever. The feel of it is great. The art by Chiang is awesome, capturing the eighties vibe, Vaughn all the way through peppers his text with fun eighties references (and I am not an eighties guy, I'm a sixties and seventies guy, but I appreciate the effort). The neon colors are wonderful, by Matt Wilson. You can see it, right, in the cover? Since it largely takes place at night it is a little darker, of course, but still amazing, award-worthy YA coloring.It's a YA text (though some schools/libraries may have trouble with some of the bad language, but Vaughn doesn't probably necessarily think of comics as something to be read IN school, at least not this one), featuring four Cleveland (Vaughn is from Cleveland) twelve year old Paper Girls (younguns, they actually deliver papers in the wee hours of the morn, as I once did at that age, as most papers were delivered in those days). They fit very well with Kamala Kahn (Ms Marvel) and other wonderful new kick-ass girl comics in this amazing time for that. They are not for me very distinct yet, there is very little actual character development, as this is the all out action first issue, so I expect we will slow down in volume 2 and get to know the girls a bit more.The action is ET (with kids on bicycles riding in the night at high speed, only all girls) meets Stand By Me (only, again, all girls), and this is for an older guy not so interesting, yet. A little too crazy, a little too much, feels a little breathless on first read. But shades of Buffy, too, in all the best ways. Brian and Joss Whedon must have a grand old time socially. A new century Algonqiuin Round Table (look it up kids: Dorothy Parker, Robert Benchley, Alexander Woolcott, George S. Kauffman), with all the crackling wit.Anyway, the action. A lot happens and very little happens on this night of all nights; it's all flash in the pan--so far. The girls proceed on this Halloween night of 1988 and meet three boys who are just sexist creeps, one of them in a Freddy Krueger costume, though more bark than bite, really. Sets up the \"real\" All Saints Day scare. Three ninjas. Then three aliens. Four against three, balance against imbalance. And pterodactyls. And time travel, ala Back to the Future, sort of. And the eighties refs have to keep a comin', Mask, walkie talkies instead of cell phones. And in the middle of the apocalypse, one of them says, \"wait, you guys give out whole candy bars for Halloween!? What's up with that?\" :) Steve Jobs and Apple come in here, though at this point it is Apple meets eighties walkie talkies.And for the YA crowd, the action has to be over the top, but you know, it's Halloween, it has to be breathless, running through the night--is it a werewolf or a werewolf costume?--with everything but the kitchen sink thrown at them. But no eek screaming girly stuff, they are tough and resourceful, of course, this is 2016 comics! Girls rule!This is my reason for four instead of five stars, or one of them, that all this pizzazz is happening, and we have no idea what is happening, and we don't really yet know much about the girls, it is all sort of whizzbang superficial in the early going. But if I were inclined to give it three stars (you have at least that for the dialogue and Chiang and color, c'mon!), I have to give it one extra star just because I know the intended audiences--1) younger folks, teens and 2) eighties folks who lived through 1988--will love it. I liked it a lot for what it is and forgive it for what it is not yet. Reads very breathlessly fast. I totally trust Vaughn to make you feel deeply and laugh a lot and resolve this with some reference to politics in satisfying plot resolution."}, {"userName": "Whitney Atkinson", "userReviewDate": "Nov 03, 2017", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/14457130-whitney-atkinson", "userReview": "TW: homophobia (+ usage of word f****t), suicide attemptThis book was just so genius. The best way I can describe it is Saga meets Stranger Things. I loved the concept of a girl squad running around to solve the world's issues. I loved the sass, the artwork, the clothing and the vibe of the entire book. I love each girl in the group for their own reasons, and I didn't find myself thinking, \"wait, who is this person?\" like I usually do in graphic novels. As far as a feminist graphic novel, I enjoyed this one more than Bitch Planet, which was weighted down with a lot of boring and aimless dialogue whereas I was glued onto every page of this. Because this book deals with time travel, it was so cool to see pop culture references from both our time and the 80s. A lot of people say that the plot of this is confusing, but compared to the mindfuck that is the Saga series, I actually followed it alright. It leaves you with unanswered questions, but those should definitely (and hopefully) be resolved in later volumes which I plan to pick up.There was a character who would make homophobic remarks, but they always went challenged by other characters.

It's a little difficult for me not to compare this to Vaughn's other ongoing series Saga, which had me hooked from the very first installment. This was was very okay.Vol. 1 could've benefitted from being a bit longer, providing a little more depth of plot and characterization. I was really feeling a young, diverse female cast on an 80's science fiction adventure. I was even getting a Stranger Things vibe from it at the beginning.

The plot is honestly kind of wacky. Weird dinosaurs and time/space travelers, maybe? I honestly didn't know what was going on like 60% of the time, but strangely it didn't bug me... There's a Stranger Things vibe with the 80s setting and the kid protagonists. The Paper Girls themselves are awfully mature for their what- 12ish years? I had a hard time buying their ages. Maybe I'm just out of touch with the young 'uns these days. I did like all of them, though, especially Erin, and I like each of their artistic representations. I feel like, characteristically, they'll grow and deepen as the series continues.I really like Chiang's art. It isn't mind-blowingly gorgeous or incredibly detailed and it's unfair to compare it to that of Fiona Staples who does the art for Vaughan's other incredibly popular series, Saga. But it does a great job telling the story. It's consistent throughout which, despite what one might think, is pretty rare in most graphic novels. I never became confused by the art and for that, I think it's great. Matt Wilson, the colorist, does a spectacular job, particularly with gradiating the colors of the sky.

Each one of the girls seems like a fully developed character and their reactions always made sense. I love the loyalty between those girls, even though they only just met. The nostalgia of this story set in the 80s is very well done and the setting felt real enough to have me along for the ride.Where this fell a bit flat for me (especially when compared to Saga) is the art.

Not that I'm a deliriously hysterical Saga fan or anything (yes, that's another series I read wrong), but I kinda sorta expected more from this because of Brian Vaughan's involvement. What more was I expecting, you ask? Well more maturity, for one. Okay, so the fact that this is called Paper GIRLS as opposed to um, you know, Paper WOMEN, should kinda sorta have clued me in as to the age of the characters. But it didn't, so it didn't. A slightly clueless shrimp is me and stuff. Note to self: blurbs from now on you shall read, before graphic novels you shall buy.Anything else? Err...No?

Those of you who have read that series know that the world-building is complex and the characters are many, and still, it\u2019s easy to follow and make connections. But Paper Girls is a whole other story. From what I understood, there are four girls involved in some kind of discovery that has altered the planet Earth. Adults and kids are being kidnapped\u2014relocated?? Killed??I was interested, because I would be interested in anything Brian K. Vaughan wrote, but I had trouble following the story.Fortunately, the characters also have no idea what is happening, so I didn\u2019t feel alienated by my lack of comprehension of the storyline. I felt as though I was learning at the same pace as the characters were, so that is a plus. If you\u2019re going to make your story complicated, at least make it so that you know as much as the people in it do. And that\u2019s what has been done here.I\u2019ll keep on reading.

I have seen a lot of friends of mine on Instagram reading it so I thought I\u2019d give it a shot.SO MUCH FUN!!My only complaint is that the story is a little bit rushed, I\u2019d like some time to let each girl get their own character development backstory or something just so it\u2019s easier to distinguish between a few of the minor character girls. I love the story though! And set in the late 80s and the tough girl and the pop culture references, I was in graphic novel heaven! Not to mention the colors of the art is so appealing, each frame with different, bold neon pink, orange, purples and blues.

The art! The coloring is vibrant and brilliant. It fits the tone and mood of the story. I love the illustration style as well!2. The characters! I love that the main characters are 4 girls who don't take anyone's shit basically.3. The plot! Interesting, crazy, and the ending left me wanting the next issue (doesn't come out till JUNE WHYYYY) so badlyWhat I didn't like (or just kinda bothered me):1. The plot! Yea it was confusing sort of but I think that's done on purpose because this volume is setting everything up. But still i was going \"whaaaaaat?\" alot 2. I don't know if my expectations were too high...but I don't know. I really enjoyed but something was missing for me. I think that I'm going to really like the next volume ALOT though because i mean i really wasn't expecting the ending at all. Overally, I liked it! I would totally recommend it but I don't think it's going to be my favorite volume in the series.
