It was a pleasure to read this trilogy as it chronicles the first three works of the author before his literary fame. The Underdog is the shortest story of the three, and while lacking in some aspects it is an intriguing first act of Underdogs trilogy and whets the reader\u2019s appetite for a taste of the resilient Wolfe Family. Fighting Ruben Wolfe delves deeply into the relationship between two brothers and best friends; Zusak's scenes of the urban working class and disaffected youths are painful in their unflinching honesty. It is in the last book of this trilogy however, Getting the Girl, that one is able to see the transition of Zusak from an amateur author into a brilliant one. His style becomes more defined and fluid, he frequently interchanges writing styles from narrative to poetry with great effect, and the desperation of his underdog (Cameron Wolfe) to fight for his survival and glory is palpable. This was a wonderful read and gives tremendous insight to the man who would go on to write unforgettable characters like Rudy Steiner, Liesel Meminger, and Death itself in The Book Thief."}, {"userName": "Dawn Teresa", "userReviewDate": "Aug 01, 2011", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/1480109-dawn-teresa", "userReview": "Originally posted on my blog, Read LoveThe Book Thief was no fluke. It was the culmination of years of work and growth from a gifted writer. When I began reading the first book in Underdogs, fearful that it would prove to be vastly inferior to The Book Thief (one of my all-time favorite books), I found real and rapid assurance that the hand that authored that masterpiece also wrote these words. In The Underdog, originally published in 1999 (and his first work), Markus Zusak's talent and unique style, and the poetic beauty that shapes The Book Thief, are already present.It's nice to see all three titles about the Wolfe brothers -- The Underdog, Fighting Ruben Wolfe, and Getting the Girl -- bound in one volume. This makes for a great reading experience as the novellas seamlessly connect to form one unified work. And you'll find that the writing is so good you'll gobble up each piece whole. So it's a relief not to have to hunt down another book or wait for another release to read more about Cameron and Ruben. It's also worth noting that this publication is the first time American readers can get their hands on Zusak's first book, The Underdog. (An observant reader might notice that the Australian version of Getting the Girl is titled When Dogs Cry. This is not just repackaging or marketing by the publisher. They bear different titles for good reason: Getting the Girl is actually a rewrite of When Dogs Cry. But I'll talk more about this later.)Let me tell you what I love about Markus Zusak's writing: His characterization. He writes about real people. These aren't heroic renderings of polished, perfect humans like you'll find on TV. Cameron and Ruben, their family, and the other folks who inhabit their world, are dirty, flawed, messy, and raw. And it's their sloppiness, their imperfections and vulnerabilities, these very human qualities, that give them life. Any time you read a Zusak book, you come away feeling like you know the characters, as if they are real people. And you feel you should be able to look out your window and find them walking in the streets. You know and understand them, and most importantly, you care about them.I won't tell you too much about the plot. A plot synopsis or book jacket will never entice you to read a Zusak book anyway. His books generally don't have out-of-this-world-I-wonder-what-this-could-be-about premises. Instead, they are about ordinary people living ordinary lives. But there is extraordinary beauty in every day life, and that's what Zusak is so gifted at revealing. When you read about Cameron and Ruben Wolfe, you'll read about Loyalty. Family. Honor. Fear. Pain. Forgiveness. Longing. Hunger. Love. Pride. Fighting. Winning. And by watching Cameron learn to live his life, you'll learn about Living.I love this book, or rather, these books, more than I could express. In fact, when I read The Underdog, I was busy and got away from it. Not wanting to cheat the book or lose the emotion, I started again at the beginning and became so engrossed that I read the entire thing without pause. The next night, I did the same with Fighting Ruben Wolfe. With each tale, my emotional connection to the characters grew. By the end, I loved Cameron. I had laughed with and at him, ached and cried for him. And I was happy for and proud of him, too. It was difficult to say goodbye when the final story ended.I didn't need to say an abrupt farewell, though. After reading a note on Markus' Facebook page, I discovered that there was a significant difference in the third book. Markus explains in this note (I wouldn't recommend reading it until after you've read the book) that the American publisher requested a change in When Dogs Cry (which would be renamed Getting the Girl). I was curious as to how the book was altered and wanted to know what Zusak's original vision was. I had to get my hands on a copy of the Aussie version. Luckily, Markus pointed readers to a couple of booksellers, and I was able to download an epub from an online store. (Now, this is the beauty of e-books! No need to wait for (and pay for) international shipping!) Once I had put the ebook on my Nook, I read it in one sitting. Then I re-read the last 100 pages of Getting the Girl. I was surprised at how the same story can be told so differently. As Zusak says, \"It was a change that would take it on a different course to arrive at almost an identical ending.\" However, while both titles end at the same place, with essentially the same final chapter, they are very different. I'm still trying to digest those differences. The emotional experience has changed. I don't want to ruin it, but if you read Underdogs, I would encourage you to read When Dogs Cry. And if you've already read When Dogs Cry, you might want to get a copy of Underdogs or Getting the Girl to compare.By all means, though, you MUST read Underdogs. You need to find out for yourself why I love Cameron Wolfe. Boy do I! Forget Team Edward or Team Jacob or Team Fill-in-the-blank-boy-heartthrob. I'm Team Cameron. And more than that, I'm Team Wolfe. Pick up this book, meet this family, and experience the beauty of Cameron's heart, soul, and words."}, {"userName": "Jessica", "userReviewDate": "Aug 20, 2011", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/202724-jessica", "userReview": "Magnificent!I know THE BOOK THIEF is the one that all kiddies rave about, and don't get me wrong: that is a brilliant book and I love it. But then I discovered GETTING THE GIRL, which led me to find FIGHTING RUBEN WOLFE, which brings us here, to the first US publication of THE UNDERDOG, contained in this omnibus of all three Wolfe brothers books. If you don't, from the first chapter of THE UNDERDOG (or any of the other two, really), fall madly in love with the endearingly awkward and yet strangely beautiful Cameron Wolfe, then something is terribly wrong with you. Cameron's voice is so clear, so poetic, and so raw, that I could literally read about him all day, every day. Cameron feels like a friend, an intimate friend, like your brother even. The things that happen in these books are heartbreaking, yet not without humor, and not without (most importantly) hope. So many authors (particularly in YA) don't seem to understand that human beings need that ray of hope to carry on. The characters need it to feel real, and like their lives will continue beyond the pages of the book, and the reader needs it in order to feel good about the book after they close the covers. These books are proof that Zusak is a born writer. Each book here is separate, and yet each is a part of the same magnificent story. THE UNDERDOG, has a beautiful, clear naivete. FIGHTING RUBEN WOLFE is raw and powerful, and GETTING THE GIRL is like a burst of light. Read them separately, read them all at once, I don't care! JUST READ THEM!And if I ever start a band, our name is going to be Bloody Miffy."}, {"userName": "Jenny", "userReviewDate": "Sep 22, 2011", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/1547655-jenny", "userReview": "Come on, people, this is Zusak we're talking about and while, yes, I love his entirely unique writing style, I adore his beautifully honest stories with their sweet messages even more. This little story doesn't have some huge event or a climactic ending, it doesn't have some whirling plot that keeps us turning pages but will be forgotten not long after the last page is read. It's about life, and the lessons we can glean from it. Sure, Cameron couldn't talk to girls and Ruben and he were pretty useless criminals. Sure Cameron doesn't get the girl and Ruben can't win at soccer; Steve gets hurt and Sarah loses her boyfriend, but the sweet lesson of Cameron's \"underdog dream\" seemed, to me, to be the whole point. Life is going to keep shoving you down, but you have to keep getting up and fighting back. I found myself just as touched and comforted reading this one as any of his others and I consider myself very lucky to have finally had the pleasure. Plus it had this little gem:\"...you don't learn anything unless you can find the patience to read.\" page 22"}, {"userName": "Heidi (Yup. Still here.)

His name is Cameron. He is geeky and shy and he has a heart of gold. What is not to love? I will add that in the intro Mr. Zuzak admitted he is Cameron so by default I guess my crush also carries to him (Who are we kidding... I love Markus too. I mean who can resist an accent?) What is it about Aussie writers? Even in their earlier books that are not as polished (such as this one) they have you laughing one minute and wanting to bawl your eyes out the next? This book is no exception. While I could tell during my read that this was a set of first novels it sure the heck beats a lot of books out there. I think the bottom line with the Aussie writers that I love that they just keep it real. They write about real people and real emotions and make you feel less alone. You feel like these crazy emotions and thoughts have happened to other people in other places and times and that despite the distance across the oceans we are all the same deep down.

And over all, I really enjoyed it. The first book of the anthology was a bit rough and uneventful, but I thought the second and third books were a lot better, and I could definitely see Markus Zusak's writing improve over the course of the trilogy. There were times when I thought the style (especially the dialogue) got kind of pretentious/annoying, but for the most part I loved the way they were written. And by the end I felt very attached to the Wolfe family and felt like I knew them all quite well.I'll probably write a more detailed review of this at some point; also I'm going to review the three books separately, and I'll add a link to those once I'm done reviewing them."}, {"userName": "Eden", "userReviewDate": "Aug 18, 2011", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/5352308-eden", "userReview": "The first thing to note is that this is an omnibus of The Underdog, Fighting Ruben Wolfe and Getting the Girl. The second thing to note is that they're Markus Zusak's very first novels. The writing style we all loved in The Book Thief didn't just spring magically from a first effort, and Underdogs is definitely representative of the journey this author's writing grew through.The biggest issue with The Underdog is that it's plot-less. This leaves it all up to Cameron to capture our interest, which he does, effortlessly. The portrayal of a regular teenaged boy with fears, wishes and hopes has never been truer. The longing he feels for the girls he meets also highlights this unique perspective; the plethora of female POVs may cause us to forget that, yes, boys do wish to be in love too. The fluid prose and realistic relationships still don't make up for the absense of a plot, though, and The Underdog has a wandering feel to it.Fighting Ruben Wolfe continues Cameron's heartfelt narration with Zusak's (now-)trademark stylish prose. Relationships are redefined and delved into in this second book, and the whole family is drawn and redrawn. The love/hate Cameron and Ruben go through will be identifiable for anyone with a sibling. A gritty picture of life in the Aussie boonies is revealed to the reader through the situations the two closest Wolfe brothers get themselves into. Emotions and boxing intermingle, bringing out the best and worst in each to make for a moving story.Humanity's favourite subject is the focus of Getting the Girl. Cameron's puppy-like approach to girls has already been introduced in the previous two books, but Ruben's love-em-and-leave-em style is developed, contrasted to his brother's style and made into an excellent source of conflict between the two. Cameron's \"unmanly\" habit of writing is perhaps a bit clich\u00e9, but the relationship he strikes up with the love interest, Octavia, is refreshingly tentative and tender. The cause of the eventual discord between them still eludes me, but it does offer a chance to build up the brotherly relationship again. (It should be noted that the US version of Getting the Girl differs in content from the Australian version -- read more here.)A common element to all three novels is a specific type of passage to end the chapter (e.g., in The Underdog, it's a dream), adding to the eloquence. Well, all the eloquence a fifteen-year-old can get. It's an eloquence which Markus Zusak clearly grew upon."}, {"userName": "Marija", "userReviewDate": "Jun 15, 2011", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/3450964-marija", "userReview": "On TCM there\u2019s a segment where Peter O\u2019Toole reflects upon his experiences working with David Lean in Lawrence of Arabia. O\u2019Toole remembers one particular scene where Lean asks him to complete five minutes of mime for the scene where Lawrence tries on, for the first time, that white robe in the desert. Not knowing what to do, O\u2019Toole thinks about it, and then remembers the dagger he has sheathed on his waist. As the film starts rolling, O\u2019Toole uses the dagger as a mirror to look at himself and then looks at his shadow on the sand, lifting his arms up in the air, letting the wind turn the white robe into wings. After the five minutes were up, Lean yells, \u201cCut!\u201d O\u2019Toole then recalls hearing Lean murmur, \u201cClever boy\u2026.\u201dWhile reading Zusak\u2019s prose, coming across his poetic lines and brief moments of personification which play with the mind, evoking poignant imagery that heightens the mood of a particular scene, I kind of feel like David Lean when he murmurs that phrase about Peter O\u2019Toole\u2026 \u201cClever boy.\u201d I\u2019m glad these three novels are being published together. On their own, they\u2019re certainly fine works, especially Getting the Girl. However, when put together they truly become something special\u2026 allowing the reader to see how the structure of the first story The Underdog, with those dream reflections, complements the structure of Getting the Girl, through those sections of free verse, Cam\u2019s \u201cWords,\u201d that are found at the end of each chapter. As well, the growth of Cam as a narrator becomes all the more apparent. Progressing from book to book, Cam\u2019s narrative style becomes tighter and more reflective, truly putting his essence in the words he\u2019s composing instead of just reporting facts and details and describing a few amusing anecdotes. All of those emotions\u2014loyalty, fear, love, anger, happiness, the feeling of being torn apart and that all important feeling of \u201chunger\u201d\u2014are placed into focus as Cam becomes more introspective, figuring out what really makes up Cameron Wolfe.As well, reading all three books in tandem provides a better picture of the city, as well as Cam\u2019s family\u2014his mother, father, Steve, Sarah and Ruben\u2014each story giving more details, allowing the reader to piece together all of those little elements, painting a more complete image in the mind\u2019s eye when reading along.All in all, the picturesque quality of Cameron\u2019s words and the personal nature of his stories create so many lasting visual images that I can\u2019t help but love them."}, {"userName": "Jillian -always aspiring-", "userReviewDate": "Feb 20, 2011", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/3085436-jillian--always-aspiring-", "userReview": "All three books in one volume?

Anything that\u2019s packaged as a complete set, be it made up of novels or comics, tends to attract my attention these days. This particular omnibus appeared to me out of nowhere, and didn\u2019t do anything for me at first. Somewhere between when I started it and when I finished it, though, it crept up on me and became one of my favorite recent reads. It\u2019s a meandering, quirky coming-of-age story that is funny and heartbreaking by turns, and will definitely touch a chord in anybody who has been a teenage boy before.This is a collection of Markus Zusak\u2019s first published works, before his recent fame for writing The Book Thief. The trilogy, comprised of The Underdog, Fighting Ruben Wolfe, and Getting the Girl, is narrated by a teenager named Cameron Wolfe. Cameron is the youngest son in a blue-collar family trying to make ends meet in an Australian suburb, and the books are a mesh of his stream of consciousness and his poetic writings as he attempts to navigate through his daily existence. The first book, The Underdog, introduces the Wolfe family and follows Cam through an aimless period in his young life where he tries to reconcile who he wants to be with the reality of who he is. Fighting Ruben Wolfe offers a bit more of a linear story: feeling like they should somehow contribute to the family, which is facing increasingly dire straits, Cam and his older brother Ruben get mixed up in clandestine, amateur boxing. As they fight, though, Cam realizes that Ruben is fighting for something other than money, and that he might be fighting for something deeper, himself. The third book, Getting the Girl, brings the themes of the first two into a familiar focus: first love and its consequences, which refines and changes everything that Cameron thought he had knew about himself.At first, I wasn\u2019t so impressed. I have a consciousness that streams just fine on its own, and so I tend to get annoyed by fiction that doesn\u2019t have a point. But the Wolfe family makes an indelible impression, and Cam in particular is intensely likeable in all his quiet nobility and earnest insecurity. Once I got accustomed to the tone of this particular slice of life (which, with all of its Australian mannerisms and references, took me a bit to do), the narrative began to solidify a little, first into an exploration of the fraught relationship between close siblings, and then into a time-tested story of love and frustration. The character development is particularly excellent, and gets more nuanced throughout the books. Fighting Ruben Wolfe\u2019s themes of sibling rivalry and family bonds build directly on Cam\u2019s observations from The Underdogs, while the messy relationships in Getting the Girl spring from the character development in Fighting Ruben Wolfe. Taken as a whole, the story arc is subtle, and brilliant.Getting the Girl particularly resonated with me. It could have easily been another entry in a somewhat crowded genre: horny teen boy learns a lesson about healthy relationships! As funny and enjoyable as books in that vein can be, they don't usually do too much for me. Perhaps it\u2019s because most of those stories only touch the surface of what it\u2019s like to have an adult\u2019s sex drive but a child\u2019s impulse control, and I don\u2019t harbor any particular nostalgia for the situations that arise from that. But Zusak\u2019s take on this particular form of teen angst struck home. While reading this, I occasionally mused that girlfriends and mothers should give these books a spin to gain some insight into the teen boy\u2019s brain. Cameron struggles with the conflict between his hormones (sex with any female that looks his way, and proving once and for all that he isn\u2019t a loser) and his heart (the little-boy desire of wanting to be nurtured and loved, and the manliness of being perceived as honorable and chivalrous). The results are the same insecurity, shame, and tendency towards self-defeat that almost every boy has to go through while growing up, and find inventive ways to cope with. His sexual fantasies are constant, and he accepts their inevitability. He also can\u2019t help but fall in love at the drop of a hat, desperate to find something noble that gives those fantasies meaning, which makes him even more self-conscious. And best of all, this is not a motif that show up fully formed in the third book, even though the story itself stands alone. Rather, it is the result of Cameron\u2019s character growth up to that point. It is beautifully understated, and cathartic to read, at least for me.The only complaint I have with this book is the same complaint I have with every omnibus edition I read, and it has to do with the cognitive dissonance of reconciling the chapters of a collection to actual standalone books. As I mentioned, my infatuation with this book was a slow burn, since I was a little nonplussed by The Underdog and didn\u2019t warm up to it until well past the halfway mark. If I were reading the standalone novel instead of this compilation, I don\u2019t think I would have hung around for the following books, and that would have been a terrible loss. But as always, I can\u2019t decide whether that speaks to a failure in the writing, or with me being psyched out by reaching the end of the \u201cbook\u201d even though I have hundreds of pages left to read in the volume I\u2019m holding. Suffice it to say that the first book is considerably more freeform and light on actual plot than the other two, so it pays off to stick it out if that bothers you.But besides that small issue, this is a fantastic little smorgasbord of coming-of-age vignettes. It effortlessly brought me back to my own struggles with my self-worth as a young man, and it has the mark of a truly great read: the more I ruminate on it after finishing it, the more I love it. I would particularly recommend this to teen guys, who I suspect would not object to a little stealth introspection hidden amongst a tale of girls, fighting, and making fun of stupid little yappy dogs."}, {"userName": "Meegy", "userReviewDate": "Feb 09, 2018", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/48616644-meegy", "userReview": "To tell you the truth I was a bit skeptical about this book at first, but as it was by Markus Zusak I wanted to read it.

My favorite character in the book is Reuben, he is the one everyone likes but still doesn't show it in his day to day life.

This book is also very relatable in that it covers topics very common today such as poverty, crime, drugs and alcohol, girls and most of all hope.

This here's the story of Cameron Wolfe. OK, THREE stories of Cameron Wolfe. Once upon a time they were little known novels by a little known YA writer from Down Under. Title of the books? The Underdog, Fighting Ruben Wolfe, and Getting the Girl. Title of the author? Markus Zusak. Reason that sounds familiar? The Book Thief.And that's the reason Scholastic has put together these three books -- Zusak's sensational success with the Holocaust sleeper, The Book Thief. Some of the books in UNDERDOGS had gone out of print, at least here in the States, but no more. And they logically go together, anyway. All have as a protagonist Cameron Wolfe, a sensitive kid who wants to be a writer. He's tough enough, though, being mentored like he is by middle brother Ruben. Ruben the Fighter. Ruben the Ladies Man. Ruben the brother Cameron will never be though he worships at the Altar of Wannabe.The writing is fundamental. If you're looking for an intricate plot or some of the technical flourishes seen in The Book Thief (narrated by Death, of all things), forget it. Stylistically, these early works are rather raw. But you can see signs of Zusak coming on, especially his word play and his love for personification.Book One establishes character. Book Two focuses on fighting. Book Three focuses on love (need? craving?). But in all cases, it's the character card that wins the game. If you don't like Cam, you won't like the book(s). Simple as that. No plot is going to ride over the hill like a cavalry come to rescue the reader. It's all characterization.Fortunately, Zusak's good at it. I cheered the kid all the way and felt sure, in the end, that he'd succeed some day. I guess Zusak himself is living proof of that.

The first novel - The Underdog - is noticeably the weakest of the three, and was in fact Zusak's first novel. There's really little to say about it, except that so little happens in it that I am a bit surprised that it was even published. It basically sets the stage for the two novels that follow.But it is followed by Fighting Ruben Wolfe, and that is a horse of another (extremely vivid) color. Ruben and Cameron, perennial losers and screw-ups, are recruited by an organizer of illegal boxing matches, and suddenly Ruben is no longer a loser like his little brother. As Ruben's successful bouts mount up, Cameron 's worries increase - his brother is turning into someone he can hardly recognize. The denouement made my eyes burn and my throat hurt - and I'm not sure if it was the emotional punches or the physical ones that affected me most.Getting The Girl, the third novel, is a satisfying closer to the series. I loved the intensely loyal, love-lorn Cameron, and I loved the relationship between the two boys. So bottom line: read The Underdog if you like a nice long setup before you get to the meat of the story; otherwise, skip straight to Fighting Ruben Wolfe and go on from there.

This book is good for people who want to know what it is like going through a teen's life but it goes into some negative relationships and how it is like to have the worst things happened to you and watching Cameron go through these struggles was really interesting. So overall it was a good book and I recommend it to people who who want to know what teen relationships are between siblings parents and others. :)"}, {"userName": "Tatiana", "userReviewDate": "Jul 29, 2015", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/22783852-tatiana", "userReview": "\u042d\u0442\u043e \u0438\u0441\u0442\u043e\u0440\u0438\u044f \u043f\u0440\u043e :\u043c\u0438\u0441\u0441\u0438\u0441 \u0412\u0443\u043b\u044c\u0444\u043c\u0438\u0441\u0442\u0435\u0440\u0430 \u0412\u0443\u043b\u044c\u0444\u0430\u0421\u0442\u0438\u0432\u0430\u0421\u0430\u0440\u0443\u0420\u0443\u0431\u0430\u041a\u044d\u043c\u0435\u0440\u043e\u043d\u0430\u041e\u043a\u0442\u0430\u0432\u0438\u044e\u041f\u0443\u0448\u043a\u0430\u043f\u0440\u043e \u043f\u043e\u0438\u0441\u043a\u0438 \u0441\u0435\u0431\u044f\u043f\u0440\u043e \u0433\u043e\u043b\u043e\u0434\u043f\u0440\u043e \u0434\u0440\u0443\u0436\u0431\u0443\u043f\u0440\u043e \u0441\u0435\u043c\u044c\u044e\u043f\u0440\u043e \u043b\u044e\u0431\u043e\u0432\u044c \u2014\u00a0\u0422\u044b \u043c\u043e\u0436\u0435\u0448\u044c \u0443\u0442\u043e\u043d\u0443\u0442\u044c \u0432\u043e \u043c\u043d\u0435, \u043a\u043e\u0433\u0434\u0430 \u0437\u0430\u0445\u043e\u0447\u0435\u0448\u044c, \u041a\u044d\u043c\u0435\u0440\u043e\u043d,\u00a0\u2014 \u0441\u043a\u0430\u0437\u0430\u043b\u0430 \u043e\u043d\u0430 \u0438, \u043a\u0430\u043a \u0442\u043e\u0433\u0434\u0430, \u043f\u0440\u0438\u043a\u043e\u0441\u043d\u0443\u043b\u0430\u0441\u044c \u0433\u0443\u0431\u0430\u043c\u0438 \u043a \u043c\u043e\u0438\u043c \u0433\u0443\u0431\u0430\u043c \u0438 \u043f\u043b\u0430\u0432\u043d\u043e \u043f\u043e\u0442\u0435\u043a\u043b\u0430 \u0447\u0435\u0440\u0435\u0437 \u043c\u043e\u0439 \u0440\u043e\u0442. \u041b\u0438\u0441\u0442\u043a\u0438 \u043e\u0441\u0442\u0430\u0432\u0430\u043b\u0438\u0441\u044c \u0443 \u043c\u0435\u043d\u044f \u0432 \u0440\u0443\u043a\u0430\u0445, \u043f\u0440\u0438\u0436\u0430\u0442\u044b\u0435 \u043a \u0435\u0435 \u0431\u0435\u0434\u0440\u0430\u043c, \u0438 \u044f \u0447\u0443\u0432\u0441\u0442\u0432\u043e\u0432\u0430\u043b, \u043a\u0430\u043a, \u043d\u0430\u0432\u0438\u0441\u043d\u0443\u0432 \u0441\u0432\u0435\u0440\u0445\u0443, \u043e\u043d\u0430 \u0432\u0434\u044b\u0445\u0430\u0435\u0442 \u043c\u0435\u043d\u044f.\u041c\u0438\u0441\u0442\u0435\u0440\u0430 \u0417\u0443\u0441\u0430\u043a\u0430 \u0438 \u0435\u0433\u043e \u0433\u0435\u0440\u043e\u0435\u0432 \u043d\u0435 \u0432\u043e\u0437\u043c\u043e\u0436\u043d\u043e \u043d\u0435 \u043b\u044e\u0431\u0438\u0442\u044c. \u041f\u0438\u0448\u0435\u0442 \u0417\u0443\u0441\u0430\u043a \u043a\u0440\u0430\u0441\u0438\u0432\u043e, \u043f\u0440\u043e\u0441\u0442\u043e \u0438 \u0442\u0440\u043e\u0433\u0430\u0442\u0435\u043b\u044c\u043d\u043e. \u041a\u043d\u0438\u0433\u0443 \u043c\u043e\u0436\u043d\u043e \u0440\u0430\u0437\u043e\u0431\u0440\u0430\u0442\u044c \u043d\u0430 \u0446\u0438\u0442\u0430\u0442\u043a\u0438. \u041e\u043d\u0438 \u043c\u0435\u0441\u0442\u0430\u043c\u0438 \u043c\u0440\u0430\u0447\u043d\u044b\u0435, \u043d\u043e \u0442\u0430\u043a\u0438\u0435 \u0434\u0443\u0448\u0435\u0432\u043d\u044b\u0435. \u041c\u043e\u0433\u0443 \u0441 \u0443\u0432\u0435\u0440\u0435\u043d\u043d\u043e\u0441\u0442\u044c\u044e \u043c\u043e\u0433\u0443 \u0441\u043a\u0430\u0437\u0430\u0442\u044c \u0447\u0442\u043e \"\u0411\u0440\u0430\u0442\u044c\u044f \u0412\u0443\u043b\u044c\u0444\" \u043f\u043e\u043f\u0430\u0434\u0443\u0442 \u0432 \u043c\u043e\u044e \u0434\u0435\u0441\u044f\u0442\u043a\u0443 \u043b\u0443\u0447\u0448\u0438\u0445 \u043a\u043d\u0438\u0433 2015 :)"}, {"userName": "Kelly", "userReviewDate": "May 11, 2015", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/31193543-kelly", "userReview": "Simply put, Zusak is a genius at writing and that was the main force to keep me reading.

It was a slow read for me for some reason, but I did enjoy it. I got to meet Cameron Wolfe for the first time (again) in the first story, \"The Underdog,\" and really get to know him. And I got to see him really come into his own in the third story, \"Getting the Girl.\" Born into a working class family, Cameron has a lot of hopes of making something of himself, but is way too realistic to think that any of them will pan out. He really wants to be his own man. He really wants to be a good guy. And he really wants to get a girl. There are a lot of ups and downs for poor Cameron. But he definitely grows stronger by the end of the collection. And at the end of each chapter, he shares his thoughts with the reader in the form of writing--they're sort of prose poems. They're raw and symbolic and beautiful thoughts. Cameron is actually a pretty deep thinker, and I'd expect nothing less from Markus Zusak. As I was reading, I marked a few pages with quotes I especially liked:I had to decide what I was going to do, and what I was going to be. I was standing there, waiting for someone to do something, till I realized the person I was waiting for was myself.When I look in the mirror, I see the color of awkwardness and uncertainty and longing. If there was an expert amongst these pages, they'd say that I just want to belong somewhere. But the truth is, I'm not sure I want to belong.Not like everyone else. That's what scares me. The thing is, I think we're all perverts. All men. All women.What is it about the sound of clapping hands? It's only skin against slapping skin, so why can it make a tide turn in you? Why can it break on top of you and lift you up at the same time? Maybe it's because it's one of the most noble things humans do with their hands. I mean, think about it.Humans make fists with their hands. They use them to fight, to steal things, to hurt each other.When people clap, it's one of the few times they stand together and applaud other people.I can move on now, because here, at this moment, no matter how fragile it might be, I can feel okayness growing inside me.The funny thing is that okayness is not a real word. It's not in the dictionary.But it's in me. \"Don't worry, brother. I don't need you to tell Sal that I'm not a loser.... I don't need you to say it to me either. I know what I am. I know what I see. Maybe one day I'll tell you a little more about me, but for now, I guess we'll just have to wait and see what happens. I'm nowhere near what I'm going to be...\""}, {"userName": "Whitley Williams", "userReviewDate": "Apr 13, 2018", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/70961401-whitley-williams", "userReview": "The Underdog by Markus Zusak is about Cameron Wolfe, a 15-year-old boy trying to find himself. Cameron has an older brother, Ruben, who is always involved in small criminal activities that never follow through. His sister, Sarah, is always with her boyfriend, Bruce. His mother works hard all week and his father is a plumber. Cameron starts working for his father on weekends, where he meets Rebecca, the girl he likes. The climax of the novel is Sarah and Bruce's break-up. Her emotional reactions unite all of the family. Cameron is affected by the break up and reevaluates himself. Cameron also deals with his friend Greg. Greg gets into a drug scandal and needs money. The book is very emotional and many parts of the book are established through Cameron's dreams. which allow the reader into his deeper feelings. The story is essentially about boys growing up, family sticking together and learning how to persevere when times get hard. A couple big themes revolving around the story is perseverance and family. When Cameron\u2019s sister goes through her breakup the family is finally unified again and is able to evaluate and discuss their family dynamics. Cameron also has a self reflection on how he treats women. Zusak states \u201csometimes I think that maybe we\u2019re not really people at all. Maybe moments are what we are. Moments of weakness, of strength. Moments of rescue, of everything.\u201d The characters have many sides to them, depending on the situation. Cameron became very vulnerable and more self aware when he saw his sister fight back emotional rage. Zusak capitalizes on how it sometimes takes a new perspective to realize what really needs to be changed within ourselves.  I read this book due to a recommendation from my friend. The book met my expectations because it had a really deep and emotional plot and dealt with family issues. It was interesting to see how Cameron actually tried to learn from his family\u2019s mistakes and wanted to make himself a better person. The personal connection I have is that I am Cameron\u2019s age and have my own family conflicts that I try to learn from. However unlike Cameron, I tend to fix the problems immediately instead of dreaming about the possible outcomes. That is the extent of my connection. I would recommend this book to teens because it definitely addresses issues teens deal with like finding their true identity. However something that is somewhat complex is the transition from dreams to reality is unclear at times. However, besides that the book is an easy read."}, {"userName": "Michele", "userReviewDate": "May 27, 2018", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/6168966-michele", "userReview": "Hooray for all three of these short novels.

I cannot even say why, because I truly enjoyed each one - but any writer that can bring me to tears and make me weep out loud ... I'll love him forever!!

If you haven't read The Book Thief, do. Read my review of it first though--I think you should know some things before you start. Read I am the Messenger too. Once you've read those, you're going to want more Markus Zusak--at least I did. Luckily I discovered Underdogs. It is a compilation of the first three books Zusak published. Originally published in his native Australia, they have only recently become available to readers in the U.S. They feel very \"Australian,\" with lots of slang and sentence structure that was strange to my American mind but understandable within context and actually really fun to experience. The three books follow a few months in the ordinary life (a Zusak theme) of Cameron Wolfe, a very self-introspective, ponderous, but in most ways normal, 15-year-old boy. The plots are very simple and center around Cameron, his older brother Ruben, and their exploits involving the rest of the Wolfe family.I enjoyed Underdogs. It is not on the same level as TBT or IATM, but still very well written and classic Zusak style. With a lot of short sentences.That are used.Effectively.Another classic Zusak element is his emphasis on the strength of words, and his unique and powerful words are on display here--albeit in a way that shows how far he's come in penning the amazing words of The Book Thief. Here's one of my favorite passages. Cameron dreams . . .\"There's a big crowd, around a fight, and they are all yelling and howling and screaming, as though punches are landing and fists are molding faces. It's a huge crowd, about eight deep, so it is very difficult to push my way through. I get down on my knees. I crawl. I look for gaps and then slip through them, until, eventually, I'm there. I'm at the front of the crowd, which is a giant circle, thick. 'Go!' the guy next to me yells. 'Go hard!' Still, I look at the crowd. I don't watch the fight. Not yet. There are all kinds of people amongst this crowd. Skinny. Fat. Black. White. Yellow. They all look on and scream into the middle of the ring. The guy next to me is always shrieking in my ear, drilling right through my skull to my brain. I feel his voice in my lungs. That's how loud he is. Nothing stops him, even the ones behind who throw words at him to make him shut up. It is no use. I try stopping him myself, by asking him something--a shout over the rest of the crowd. 'Who y' going for?' I ask. He stops his noise. Immediately. He stares. At the fight. Then at me. A few more seconds pass and he says, 'I'm goin' for the underdog . . . I have to.' He laughs a little, sympathetically. 'Gotta go for the underdog.' It is then that I look at the fight, for the first time. 'Hey.' Something is strange. 'Hey,' I ask the guy again, because there is only one fighter inside the huge, loud, throbbing circle. A boy. He is throwing punches wildly and moving around and blocking and swinging his arms at nothing. 'Hey, how come there's only the one fella fighting?' It is the guy next to me again that I have asked. He doesn't look at me this time, no. He keeps focused on the boy in the circle, who fights on so intensely that no one can take their eyes off him. The guy speaks to me. An answer. He says, \"He's fighting the world.' And now, I watch as the underdog in the middle of the circle fights on and stands and falls and returns to his haunches and feet and fights on again. He fights on, no matter how hard he hits the ground. He gets up. Some people cheer him. Others laugh now and rubbish him. Feeling comes out of me. I watch. My eyes swell, and burn. 'Can he win?' I ask it, and now, I too cannot take my eyes off the boy in the circle.\"Pretty cool, right?As you might imagine, getting into the authentic mind of a 15-year-old boy the topics get a little . . .ummmm. . . I\u2019ll say \"girl-centric.\" There were a couple of moments when I was afraid Cameron's thoughts would go too far and I would have to put the book down before it crossed my boundary of appropriateness. Luckily, Cameron is a really good guy and his thoughts never got that far. I actually found Cameron to be a little too deeply introspective at times. I even felt a bit that Cameron was a weird-o because I don't know any 15 year olds who really think as deeply as he does. Other times, though, I really felt like Cameron was right on, and I remember feeling the same way. Maybe I was a weird-o. Hmmmm. . . .Underdogs was a pretty great read, and I recommend it to all mature readers with the same enthusiastic plug I gave for The Book Thief and I am the Messenger.
