This is a book that kept my entire attention from the very beginning until the end, and not many books can do that. This has something in it for everyone: mystery, romance, contemporary concerns, and true faith. This is a book that is clean and well-written.In light of current media stories where people go missing far too often, this was a smart topic to cover in this book. The author kept me guessing almost until the very end. At one point, I said to myself that she could steer the book at least fifty different ways. I had to force myself to stop and eat lunch and do other things that were necessary. I actually forgot that this was a fiction book.In addition to this, there is a very inconvenient romance, and I was greatly touched and conflicted as I read about it. I was so glad that those involved turned to the Lord. While the gospel message is not expressly stated in the book, it is clear that a foundation based on a relationship with God is absolutely key.I can't recommend this book highly enough. It should be a joy for anyone who enjoys mysteries and romances. I was sent a copy of this book in exchange for my honest review. I was not financially compensated, and all opinions are 100 percent mine."}, {"userName": "Brittany", "userReviewDate": "Jul 08, 2017", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/18727044-brittany", "userReview": "Oh my goodness! This novel was absolutely compelling and one that I could not set down. Even though it was fiction, I felt myself following the story and waiting for leads as breathlessly as the characters in this book.I had this book on my shelf for a couple of years and finally worked up the courage to read it. I have enjoyed other stories written by this author, but was not sure if I could handle this very grave subject matter. I'm glad I waited and read it when I was really in the right place to give it all of my focus. It was an amazing story, written very skillfully.

I hate the cliched term \"If you only read one book this year...\" but I honestly think that can describe this book. If I had to only read one book this year it would be this one. I was not only surprised and delighted by what I found between these covers, but totally amazed that I had not yet discovered this talented author. This is a Christian fiction book like no other that I have read. The author, Deborah Raney, has written a tender tale of love, loss, forgiveness and enduring friendship that transcends the everyday world. She has created characters who are worthy of the book they are in and who struggle to do what they feel is right in their own eyes and the eyes of their creator. I was enthralled with this book for a number of reasons. First, there is mystery and it is the type of mystery that does not relent until the end of the book. My desire to know what happened and how it happened made me feel like one of the characters and in some way, caused me to sympathize in ways I never thought I could with those who have had things like this happen in real life. Secondly, over the course of this book I grew to genuinely care for the characters in this story. My favorite character was Shelley. From the beginning she was strong and supportive, but also compassionate and the type of person you can't help but love. She put her desire to please the lord and help the family of her best friend over her own wants. I was pleased with the way the author ended this story. There were no loose ends that still needed to be tied up and I thought the conclusion to the mystery was perfect. If you are looking for a book that can make you feel, really feel something, this is where you should go.

I was reading feverishly right away, trying to find out what happened to Jill. I found myself thinking backwards like Mitchell, wondering what on earth could have happened to Jill. Did she leave because of something he did? Did somebody hurt her? Did she get in an accident? I think this was excellent writing by Raney, especially because I didn't even realize until now that she had done so.I also found that this book lit a fire under me. I have always said to my husband, \"If I fall of the face of the earth, then...\" followed by telling him how to do something or where something is. Well, what would happen if I did disappear? So many details that are critical to our household running would be lost or very difficult to find. I think this novel should urge all readers to get their affairs in order; even if they don't need them soon, they'll still be ready for when they are needed. It made me realize that I really need to make a \"in case of emergency\" file or something, just in case.I have to admire Mitchell's dedication to his wife. How many other husbands would not only keep looking and searching but also be able to withstand the temptation of the other adult who loved his wife so much? Mitchell's love for Jill shines brilliantly in his actions in this area, as well as many others."}, {"userName": "Melissa", "userReviewDate": "Feb 20, 2013", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/721595-melissa", "userReview": "Excellent story about a woman who disappears off the face of the earth.

Raney\u2019s novel is gut-wrenching, but incredibly satisfying.While attending an out-of-state conference, Mitchell Brannon\u2019s wife Jill leaves a message saying she is heading home and should be there for dinner. When she fails to arrive, Mitchell enlists the help of the police and their longtime friend and neighbor Shelley, but Jill seems to have vanished.

Debra says, \u201cIt seems our society has all but discarded the value of loyalty in marriage\u2026I believe the wedding vows are sacred and precious, and its been one of my goals as a writer to portray the kind of marriage I've seen modeled in my family\u2026.

As the hours pass and dread sets in, it\u2019s hard to stay calm, and know when to notify his college age children. He wondered where she could be. Broken down some where? What could have happened? What should he do now to find her? It was driving him crazy.This author had this story set in current time using all the latest and greatest technology available to track down someone whose lost, GPS, cell-phone tracking someone\u2019s text messages, facebook page etc. It was interesting to read and discover that Mitchell didn't know every single thing about his wife as they explore all the messages she received and sent out. This surprised him, he thought he knew everything there was to know!Mitchell enlists the help of their next-door neighbor, Jill\u2019s best friend, Shelley to help watch for his wife while he searches the roads to see if she has broken down. Shelley is more than happy to help. She struggles about sharing Jill\u2019s confidence one that might be a lead and something that might hurt Mitchell\u2019s feelings. In sharing this it would betray her friend\u2019s trust. But how would she feel if this really turned out to be something.Debra Raney pens a heart felt, believable story that had me instantly care for and agonize with her main characters as they try to find Jill Brannon \u2013 wife, mother of two, BFF to Shelley, and teacher in a school to many. These characters and their flight will stay in your heart long after you've closed the book.

This story is both captivating and beyond description. It is part mystery, part romance, with faith being the centerpiece and cornerstone to the story. The author writes with a heart of understanding for people who really have lived through tragedies that rock their world forever changing the landscape of normal. Here is a fictional work that gives readers a glimpse of lives changed when a person disappears without a trace, not knowing the answers to questions that arise from the person\u2019s absence every day.\tMitchell and Jill are now empty nesters with both children away at college, Jill is a third grade teacher with one school, and Mitchell is a principal. After shedding an abundance of tears because her daughter just left for college, Jill goes to a teachers\u2019 conference to help refocus her life now with only her husband and dog at home. Jill calls letting Mitchell know she is on her way home, but she never shows up. Minutes turn to hours, hours to days and days to months, without much progress made on what happened to Jill or where she could be.\tThe novel shows the possible thoughts and challenges the family goes through when all hope seems lost, especially as Mitchell doesn\u2019t feel free because of lack of closure. Jill\u2019s best friend becomes a support and aid to the whole family throughout this trial. Shelley is like a sister to Jill, a prayer warrior and helping the family wade through the outpouring of meals, cares and phone calls. In time, Shelley finds that now she and Mitchell have developed their own friendship, but can anything else develop?\tAt the end of the novel, the author shares a heart-filled note to the readers about the various themes addressed in the novel. I really became engrossed in the story as I turned each page, watching the characters go through hope-filled leads only to find despair. Personally, I haven\u2019t dealt with anything remotely comparable to the story, but I saw the wisdom of God in the way the author tells the story.\tUltimately, having to let go without having all our answers to our multitude of questions is a true test of our hearts and emotions when we don\u2019t see the total picture or ending in sight. Can we release ourselves or our loved ones to God without feeling the pressure to find them? How do we live each day without any closure to the wounds life has brought? I agree with the author that we need to seek the Lord and obey however He moves our hearts. Whether you have experienced someone just disappearing or not, I am sure you will find hope, encouragement and enjoyment in reading The Face of the Earth.\tMy rating is 5+ stars.Note: I received a complimentary copy for an honest review of this book.

Isn't every person's nightmare one where a loved one never comes home? When Michell's wife fails to return home from a teacher conference, he does everything in his power to find her. I really felt for Mitchell. I can only imagine the panic and frantic feeling of not knowing what happened. Along the way, he finds out some secrets about Jill that make him start to question his relationship with her. His heartache and guilt over imagining the worst about her came across so well. Through his faith and prayer, he is able to find some consolation. The story takes place over a year. While they are waiting for Jill to come home, the routine of life still goes on. Holidays come and go. Work and school are still there.The book also deals with the question of how far do you take your vows that you make to your spouse? How long are you supposed to wait before you move on? One year? Ten? Can your faith be enough to sustain you until you get the answers that you need so desperately? Both Mitchell and Shelley struggle with this as they grow closer through their grief over the loss of Jill. I thought the situation was handled very well and realistically. I commended both Mitchel and Shelley for recognizing their weakness toward each other and doing things to make sure they remained just friends. After reading the book, I'm not sure that I am any closer to an answer. I honestly don't know what I would do in this situation. I think it is only something that each person can answer for themselves. It is definitely a book that makes you do some deep soul searching. Do they ever find Jill? I don't want to give that away. I'll just say that I loved the ending. I felt like I got closure and was happy with the conclusion of my journey with Mitchell and his family."}, {"userName": "Laura", "userReviewDate": "May 14, 2013", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/2521894-laura", "userReview": "Title: THE FACE OF THE EARTHAuthor: Deborah RaneyPublisher: Howard BooksMay 2013ISBN: 978-1416599975Genre: ContemporaryWhat if she never came home . . . ?When Mitchell Brannon\u2019s beloved wife sets off for home after a conference, he has no idea that his life is about to change forever.

This is the type of novels that leaves you pondering things even after you finish the last page. I really liked how the story ended because it brought closure to everything. I also appreciated the realistic struggles that the hero and heroine had. This author does a good job with stirring emotion in the reader and making hearts ache as well as rejoice. There were just enough \"we think we've found out what happened\" scenarios to make it seem suspenseful, even though it wasn't a suspense novel. There was also a mystery element to the book. It would be hard to sit around waiting when the trail seems to grow colder by the day.The questions Mitch asked himself were legitimate ones. How do you know when it's time to let go? How do you get peace in a situation like this? Why did God let it happen and why did it take so long to find out the truth? Well, God knows what he's doing and if we tune into His will, we will find peace and a deeper relationship with Him, but we have to surrender our own plans first. It's really hard to talk about some of the characters' journeys without posting spoilers and this is the kind of book that you don't want to cheat and read the end first.Half the beauty of reading the story is not knowing the outcome. The moral and spiritual dilemmas are more complex when the reader doesn't know the future... just like in real life. How many decisions would we change if we knew what the future held? It was a realistic and touching journey for me in that respect. I really enjoyed this story."}, {"userName": "Casey", "userReviewDate": "Mar 12, 2013", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/3194216-casey", "userReview": "Contemporary women\u2019s fiction with a strong plot line that had me hooked from the back cover copy. What has become of Jill? Kidnapped? Run away? Nervous breakdown? Lost? Dead? Three hundred pages of trying to find this woman who has simply disappeared off the face of the earth. Husband Mitch is such a character to feel for. What is he to do? Searching, passing clues to the police and each one is a dead end. Can one even imagine being in such a position?I think the story does a good job of what that must feel like to have someone you love just disappear and you have no clue why. The story plays with great realism and yet still keeps our main characters likeable and as real as the people who might live next door. The ending is heartbreaking. It\u2019s one you know is coming, you have a pretty good idea of what has happened after reading the entire book. And on one hand my heart was saddened, on the other I was grateful our characters had their \u201canswer\u201d. The story is the struggles faced with every human life. It\u2019s a love story twined through as real life story as what might be ripped from the headlines.

Jill Brannon has vanished. Her cell phone, dropped in the hotel parking garage, is not on her person or vicinity. Jewelry left in her room from a long ago past is just that: closing a past. Months go by, season to season. Jill Brannon has not returned home. Her husband Mitchell, with the help of the next-door-neighbor and her best friend, Shelley, try to research the steps Jill might have taken. They begin interviewing conference attendees who might have spoken with her, and travel the different back roads she might have taken through scenic turning leaves. Nothing sticks out in anyone's memory beyond she was a nice person upon meeting her. Holidays have passed by without her with them. Their children are back in college. There have been no profitable leads. Her missing person case has been transferred from the initial detective to another for follow-up. TV news and newspaper accounts are no longer prominent. She has vanished, seemingly, from the face of the earth. Where do you continue to look? Her car description nor license plate have turned up in any law agency search. Where do we go when there are undetermined happenings in our lives? There is only one place for hope: relying on the One who knows us best.I have told you these things, so that in me you may have peace. In this world you will have trouble. But take heart! I have overcome the world.--John 16:33 Through the long months, Mitchell and Shelley continue to search for Jill. What if there is no answer, no closure? After the casseroles stop coming, and sympathetic looks turn to suspicion, Mitchell seeks to uphold his marriage vows, till death do us part. In honoring their relationship, Shelley desires to continue friendship and support. I was eager for this story to progress for these families. It is day-to-day with putting one foot in front of the other. It is unpredictable and real; the unknown, uncertainty. Leaning upon and trusting God's care for us is sure. This story reflects the treasure given in knowing and receiving the depth of His love. Jill's disappearance challenges and reveals faith and obedience as lives are surrendered to Him.

Jill Brannon takes her husbands advice and attends a conference designed for teachers in nearby Kansas City and is expected back in a couple of days. All goes well and there's even a message awaiting Mitchell on their answering machine at home, that Jill has checked out of the hotel and is planning to see him soon with a surprise just for him. That was more than 5 hours ago. More than enough time for Jill to have driven home. There are no adverse weather conditions that would prevent her from arriving home as expected and despite all his calls to her cell phone all he gets is voicemail. How long will he have to wait before she comes home. How long would you wait?In the latest novel The Face of the Earth, Deborah Raney takes the reader into every single persons worst nightmare. What happens when someone you love simply vanishes off the face of the Earth without a trace. I found myself cringing at the waiting that Mitch has to do in simply not knowing where Jill has gone. The police have no clues and no real motives to speak of. Despite all his attempts to convince them that Jill is not the type to simply walk away from her marriage and family, they've seen enough cases to know this could very well be a possibility. Mitch relies on the help of Jill's best friend and their neighbor Shelley, to see if between the two of them, they might figure out where Jill is before the police can. But what if they can't? What if she simply has had a mid-life crisis and has left them all behind? Will Shelley confide in Mitch that Jill's ex boyfriend contacted her on Facebook and wanted to meet while she was away at the conference?You'll have to pick this novel out to find out how it all ends!I received The Face of the Earth by Deborah Raney compliments of Howard Books, a division of Simon and Schuster Publishers for my honest review and received no monetary compensation for a favorable one. This was such a compelling novel for me to not want to put it down until I knew what the outcome would be. In fact, I had to fight myself several times to not rush to the back of the book to find out more than half way through because the suspense was killing me. I forced myself to wait it out simply because like people who experience this kind of nightmare for real, the answers aren't found simply by going to the end of the book. They have to painstakingly live through it minute by minute. I am thankful that Deborah Raney decided to come up with a conclusion for this novel instead of simply leaving it as Jill never coming back and leaving the reader to come up with their own conclusions on what happened. Thank you, thank you for that! This one is a great read and makes you wonder how you would react in the similar situation, and praying that you never will have to know. I rate this one a 4.5 out of 5 stars and have added this to my growing Deborah Raney library of novels."}, {"userName": "Victor Gentile", "userReviewDate": "May 12, 2013", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/2528881-victor-gentile", "userReview": "Deborah Raney in her new book, \u201cThe Face of the Earth\u201d published by Howard Books brings us into the life of Mitchell Brannon.From the back cover: What if she never came home . . . ?When Mitchell Brannon\u2019s beloved wife sets off for home after a conference, he has no idea that his life is about to change forever.

Ms. Raney gives us a mystery as to what really happened to Jill and what will happen between Mitchell and Shelley. \u201cThe Face of the Earth\u201d deals with relationships and is so well balanced to keep it from becoming really depressing which in the hands of a lesser author would have become.

Unfortunately my experience ended way too quickly. Now my only hope is that several months down the road the story will grow old enough in my brain that I can pick it up (almost) as new and enjoy it all over again!\nThe Face of the Earth details the story of Mitchell Brannon, his wife Jill, and her best friend Shelly. Mitch and Shelley\u2019s lives are thrown into turmoil when Jill leaves for a conference and never makes it home. The police are called in, but no answers are forthcoming.As the hours turn into days and then weeks and months, Mitch lives in limbo. He agonizes over what message God is sending him. Is He telling Mitch to get on with his life or to wait indefinitely for an unlikely ending? Shelley reaches out to Mitch and attempts to ease his pain. But nothing seems to work without Jill. As the story develops, both Shelley and Mitch experience deep emotions---grief, despair, hope, guilt.\nEverything but peace.\n And as I read, I wasn\u2019t thinking or analyzing or predicting what would come next. I was simply feeling right along with the characters. I love how subtly Mitch and Shelley grow. The author deftly shows their hearts changing little by little, through all the daily events, big and small, until they finally find that elusive peace. \nUntil they finally know that---whether they ever receive answers or closure or second chances---\u201cAll shall be well, and all shall be well and all manner of thing shall be well.\u201d ~Julian of Norwich~This book reminded me that often our lives are lived in what feels like limbo: a place or state of restraint or confinement; a place of uncertainty. Yet God, who sees \u201cone day as a thousand years and a thousand years as one day,\u201d faithfully gives us whatever we need to embrace abundant life even in those long, waiting moments.I\u2019m so thankful that He does!\nI won this book from a blog contest and was under no obligation to review it.
