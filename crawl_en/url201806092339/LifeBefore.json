LIFE BEFORE is a fast-paced, emotional read that tells the story of Xander Fife, who has just graduated from high school only to find himself on the run from family trauma. His voice is real, honest, and funny, even as he\u2019s wrestling with some of the darkest memories you could imagine. His journey is a compelling one, fraught with the real-world challenges of being alone on the road and the spiritual turmoil of finding a way to live a meaningful life that acknowledges the past but embraces the present. Seeing him forge a path for himself with the help of new friends makes for a memorable, heartfelt read."}, {"userName": "Raina", "userReviewDate": "Nov 07, 2017", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/1640308-raina", "userReview": "\"On the run from a killer\" - that sounds like an action flick, right?But this is a book about the nitty-gritty.

Kids in abusive families are often forced to grow up before they should have to, but for Xander, the biggest change in his life comes in one harrowing moment. It's enough to make him give up everything, and watching that happen--reading this book--is really difficult at times.

When his dark past erupts into tragedy, Xander Fife must leave behind his friends, his hometown, and everything he knows, and go on the run; flinging himself headlong into what he first views as a terrible limbo - a meager and fugitive existence eked out in fits and starts as he waits for a dangerous situation to resolve itself - he soon discovers things about life, and about himself, that he never knew before.Xander undergoes some very painful evolution over the course of this novel. He has a believably complex relationship with his mother - whom he both loves and sometimes resents - and a realistic (if sometimes unfair) attitude towards her failings as a protector during the years when the pair of them suffered domestic abuse at the hands of Gary, Xander's father. These are heavy and complicated subjects, and Bacon does a wonderful job of not trying to water them down or candy-coat them for easier digestion. Equally impressive is the way in which she shows how a boy who has learned too much too early about self-reliance can still be completely at sea when forced to fend entirely for himself.The friendships that Xander makes while in his self-imposed exile are developed beautifully, and each character he encounters feels whole, satisfying, and important. Based on the brief description of the novel, I think I expected the plot to be somewhat explosive, and was surprised to find that it was remarkably subtle instead - filled with small moments and quiet shifts in Xander's emotional journey that are movingly profound and life-changing. There's a lot of sadness here, but a lot of optimism as well, and I'm impressed by how well Bacon has balanced the two."}, {"userName": "Grace (gracefulreads)", "userReviewDate": "Jun 06, 2016", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/13837607-grace-gracefulreads", "userReview": "3.5 Stars rounded up to 4!LIFE BEFORE is a powerful and truthful novel. It tackles abuse, death, friendship, and romance in under 300 pages. I think that at the heart of this novel is a coming of age story that will make you feel. Xander growing as a character and figuring out who he wants to be was really inspiring. This book is unforgiving in the tragedies and abuse that Xander faces, and that shocked me a bit in the beginning. The characters were very intriguing and multi-dimensional which I really appreciated. I do think we could have gotten a lot longer book that would have told us more about the characters and their backstories. I really loved the kindness of strangers in this novel and the realistic behaviors that Xander encounters.Overall, I really enjoyed LIFE BEFORE. It was very frightening and realistic at some points, allowing you to feel really engrossed and connected with the story. I would recommend this to readers who are mature and are okay with reading about abuse.

During his childhood, he struggled with the emotional and physical pain of his abusive father. After many years of Xander and his mom getting beaten, the mother finally got a divorce from him. From that point on, Xander had a pretty normal life, attending high school, playing soccer, and hanging out with friends. But on the night of his graduation, things went downhill very quickly. All of sudden, Xander is all by himself in a place far away from home, and becomes a new identity to save himself and his life.I would recommend Life Before.

I was concerned the book would be too dark and difficult for me, but instead it touched me deeply. Xander is so real in his struggles to figure out who he is and what life is and how to move forward.

That's the best word to describe this book. From the description, I expected a story about a runaway trying to survive mixed with a dash of thriller and a heavy dose of abuse and family drama. What I got was a story that had the elements of all that, but with little plot, slow pacing, and more of a focus on dating and girls than the hardships of surviving on the street (which the story glosses over quite a bit, not to mention that for most of the time the kid is able to find nice people who take care of him).It was just a really slow book with little tension to it. The climax came and went with easy resolution, taking less than half a chapter. I mean, really. It was a blip in the book and left me wondering what was the whole point of the story was, if it could be resolved so easily. It didn't make any sense.Basically, the story had potential to have a lot of drama and tension, but every problem was solved relatively easily and every emotional problem tackled in little time, stripping the story of any depth or meaning. I came away thinking it was more of a teen romance with a dash of drama, because more focus was given to the main character's hormones than the main storyline.***Content Warning: There's a fair amount of swearing in the book. Maybe a dozen f-bombs, and then a dozen more other various swear words. There's no actual sex in the book, but there's a few discussions of it, including a ridiculous aborted sex scene where a female character tries to get the hero to have sex with her. Nothing graphic per se but worth mentioning, if you're worried about your teen reading it. The language would give it an R-rating, but the sexual content is more of a PG-13 level."}, {"userName": "Casey Lyall", "userReviewDate": "Jul 02, 2017", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/46235635-casey-lyall", "userReview": "Tense and emotional with characters that draw you in.

Xander and his mother live on their own since his abusive father was given a restraining order a few years ago. Xander's life with his mother has gotten better ever since. Only his best friend Jill knows all of the terrible things Xander's father has done. In a few days time everything falls apart again. Xander's father murder's his mother and Xander's world is shattered. The loss is a huge weight on him because he and his mother had a great relationship and Xander feels like he did nothing to protect her. He begins to distance himself from everyone he loves until he finally decides to just leave everything and everyone behind until his father is found. He heads to NY to protect the people he loves. He was staying with Jill and her family, but his father threatened them and he doesn't want them to be taken away too. While in NY Xander meets a few people who help him stay on his feet until he can go back home again. People who will impact his life more than he knows. I really enjoyed this book and I loved the character's. Each character was unique even when they seemed like they would be boring in real life I just enjoyed their personalities. The author did a great job of describing the character's without going overboard. I felt like the resolution was very dry though. Everything was resolved in one chapter which was like five pages and I know the author tried to make the scene a bit dramatic. Which it was and not overly so, but I wanted more. At the same time though I knew that walking away was probably a better choice for Xander instead of demanding answers he'd never really get. Xander did get a better ending than I had expected which was great. This was an easy and simple read yet it had great subject matter that left me on edge at times.

He was a fantastic best friend, his dream girl is interested in him, and his mom is finally separated from his abusive father. Of course, drama needs to happen to keep up a story, and Bacon does not disappoint. I always like reading YA tales from a male perspective as I don't think we see it enough. Sometimes it really works and sometimes it doesn't. This is one where, for the most part, it worked. There were a few moments that made me hope that real boys would act differently, but the story stood up well.The\u00a0plot of\u00a0Life Before\u00a0was intriguing. A teen boy on the run from his family's secrets armed with a fake ID, some cash and a hunting knife. I did enjoy the writing of\u00a0Michele Bacon. She can really speak in a male voice and she was able to pull of some situations that should have been ridiculous well. The pacing had a few issues where it jumped around a bit. It did always catch itself up, but there were time where I was not sure what day we were in. The world built was nice and detailed once Xander left home. I enjoyed seeing the locations through his eyes. There were a lot of emotions in the book. Xander was protrayed well and I enjoyed that as a teen boy, he had feelings. There were a few times that his feelings did not quite match the situation he was in, but again teen boy. The characters were half and half for me. I like that this was told from the perspective of Xander, as I don't think there are enough YA stories from a male perspective. At times I loved Xander and wanted to hold him and tell him everything would be alright, and then I wanted to shake him for being just stupid. It was pretty much the same with every character. They would have fantastic moments, and then just crappy ones.While I was engaged with Life Before, I was also frustrated at times with the lead Xander. I understood his motivations, but I always get annoyed when a teen heads off to \"fix\" something on their own. The majority of times, if they went to an adult or the authorities the problem would be fixed. There would be no story or no drama either, so it is a careful balance that the author must use. At times this story tipped into the ridiculous and as an adult I was annoyed. This happens at times when, as an adult, I read a YA book that has a plot point that I just don't get. I always try to temper my reaction with the fact that I am not the key audience for the read. This was\u00a0Michele Bacon's d\u00e9but, and I think it did work overall and I will be interested in seeing what she writes next. Favorite lines - Maybe that\u2019s what life is: a series of tearing your heart into tiny pieces and giving them to other people. Maybe as soon as you detach yourself from someone you love, you can never be whole again. Okay. So what part of my heart is mine? Biggest clich\u00e9 - I don't need anyone's help.\u00a0Have you read Life Before, or added it to your TBR?This book was most likely received free from the publisher/author in exchange for an honest review. This does not affect my opinion of the book or the content of my review."}, {"userName": "Kathy", "userReviewDate": "Feb 26, 2016", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/3446463-kathy", "userReview": "Michele Bacon\u2019s contemporary young adult debut, Life Before, is a poignant journey of self discovery and ultimately, healing, for seventeen year old Xander Fife.With his high school graduation just days away, Xander is looking forward to this final summer with his friends before his \u201creal\u201d life begins. He and his best friend, Jill Bernard, are looking planning a road trip, he is dating his longtime crush, Gretchen Taylor and best of all, a scholarship to Tulane means he can leave his small hometown behind him once and for all. However, a chance encounter with his estranged father\u2019s new girlfriend sets in motion an unforeseen chain of events that ends in tragedy. In order to protect his friends, Xander decides to leave town until the threat is over, but the situation is not resolved as quickly as he thought it would be. Life on the run is not as easy as he assumed and Xander is soon dependent on the kindness of strangers until it is safe to return home.Xander is a likable character who is genuinely concerned for his friends\u2019 safety. His childhood was absolutely terrifying until his mom finally divorced his father and although they struggled financially for years, things have turned around for them recently. He is close to his mom and when he unwittingly puts her in danger, Xander is absolutely crushed by the weight of guilt after a confrontation goes horribly wrong. With this guilt pressing down on him, he takes matters into his own hands to protect his friends from danger.With a pocketful of cash, a hefty dose of paranoia and a somewhat ill-conceived plan, Xander\u2019s journey begins on a Greyhound bus. Arriving in a small college town, his goal is stay out of sight until Jill lets him know it is safe to return home. But things go quickly awry when accommodations are scarce and he is forced to find an alternate place to stay. Xander then goes on to make some rather unwise financial choices and he is soon rather desperate when his funds begin to run low. He discovers a handful of places he can go during the day but at night, his options are very limited. Ignoring Jill\u2019s continued pleas to return home, Xander sticks to his plan even as his situation becomes increasingly precarious. An unexpected friendship yields not only a job and a temporary place to stay, but an unanticipated friendship that provides him with a new perspective about himself and his future.Life Before is a well-written and engaging young adult novel that delves into some very difficult subject matter. Despite the gravity of these topics, Michele Bacon manages to keep the story from becoming overly dark or angst-ridden. Xander\u2019s plight is sympathetic and although his solution is not exactly well thought out, he gains valuable insight about himself and his life through his experiences and the people he meets. All in all, a very touching story that I highly recommend to fans of the genre."}, {"userName": "Becky Hutchison", "userReviewDate": "Jun 07, 2016", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/17889513-becky-hutchison", "userReview": "LIFE BEFORE\n is a young adult suspense by Michele Bacon.

Xander tries to live his life as a normal kid with a normal family. But he has secrets that he can't reveal, even to his best friend Jill. One day Xander and Jill are planning their Infinite Summer. The next, he's hiding from his murderous father. Xander ends up in Burlington VT, intending to stay off the grid (essentially disappear) until Gary is captured and thrown in jail. While in VT he meets some friendly and intriguing people who help him survive day to day, teach him to approach life with curiosity and wonder, and encourage him to live in the present instead of waiting until some future accomplishment to begin his life.The characters in \nLIFE BEFORE\n are fully-developed with clear identities and motivations. The descriptions of places and things are so vibrant, one feels as if you're standing beside Xander as he stumbles through his days, constantly on the outlook for danger. Xander's poignant story is both sad and beautiful. Sad for what he's had to suffer throughout his young life. Beautiful for his strength and growing confidence. Though the issues raised are serious, the story isn't depressing. It is, at times, funny and always full of friendship and hope. Xander comes to realize he has the ability to take care of himself and that he is far from alone, as he has wonderful friends who support him and who accept him for who he is.\nLIFE BEFORE\n is perfect for readers of John Green, Jennifer Echols and Sarah Dessen and a quick read for vacation.

Any other guy with two ID's \u2013one genuine, one fake \u2013 running scared from a murderer.\u201dLaunching with a mysteriously gripping preface, the author quickly snatches readers' attention, but what starts off strong, slowly becomes a catch and release maneuver instead of a steady pull.He killed once, and now he's stalking me, waiting me out, watching my every move. I have no choice I have to skip town.This is a mainstream novel. It isn't overflowing with heart, nor is it sincerely disingenuous. It just...is. The protagonist shies from being truly akin to readers, while the antagonist also lays out of reach from emitting strong feelings. With a stop and go pace, this reader had a hard time connecting to anything the author produced \u2013 character, circumstances, or place. When it comes to tackling heavy topics like murder and abuse, as this novel did, there needs to be something the reader can really grab hold of to insight powerful reaction, and this spark fizzled out.There were a few side stories and minor characters at play that felt more compelling than the one the author focused on. These surface more than midway into the book, and sadly for me, they weren't enough to compensate the story as a whole.\u201cSitting in the sunned grass, legs crossed, holding ...hands, I share the whole story.She listens intently, and my life feels real. This life, right here. Right now.\u201dIf you are a reader who is desires a contemporary fiction with a male point of view, this novel is a pretty good bet, but if you're wanting that, and a knee-jerk reaction you may want to check out the following titles: Being Henry David, by Cal Armistead and Send, by Patty Blount."}, {"userName": "Sandy", "userReviewDate": "Feb 20, 2017", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/3580282-sandy", "userReview": "Such an amazing book but the subject matter is very heavy. Xander has a secret and he has kept it for many years. I'm so glad there are books like Life Before that are about touchy subjects such as domestic abuse. I felt so bad for Xander and even for Jill, his best friend, who has witnessed some of the abuse. The author does a great job getting across how the main character feels and how he reacts to everything. I can't imagine being in this situation but with Xander I can see through his eyes. It's a sad story but I was happy for Xander at the end."}, {"userName": "QueenRitz", "userReviewDate": "Feb 09, 2017", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/6057072-queenritz", "userReview": "There were moments where I really enjoyed and appreciated this book. Abuse is awful, Xander went through a lot, and the ending went really well for him. I understood Xander at times, his thought process of real life beginning after college was something I went through as well. That being said... At times the Xander plot just seemed so unrealistic and careless. Like, why the hell did he think opening an email from his tech-expert abusive father was a good idea? He went through so much just to keep his trail cold, but then just does something so completely stupid. Ugh. Why? I didn't feel any depth at all from any of the other characters. None of them seemed real to me, except maybe Curt. We didn't learn anything about Gary \u2013 his characterization was just so sloppy and shallow. He's just a bad guy because reasons. Xander's mom too was such a lifeless character \u2013 we hear a hundred times about why Xander misses her, but he never really tells us anything about her, unless you count the two pages at the end where someone else does. Kat and Gretchen were both so blah. Kat being a guarded person and then suddenly after getting ice cream with Xander for a couple hours completely changes and starts saying things like, \"Xander, you really see me for who I am.\" Based on what? Two hours of getting ice cream and chatting and then dancing and listening to music? And then Gretchen just being there \u2013\u00a0some idealized girl with no personality that we see. Xander doesn't even talk much about why he likes her, except for how pretty and nice she is. Nothing stood out to me. Hell, maybe this is just me. Many other people enjoyed this book and you'll probably be one of them."}, {"userName": "Teenreadsdotcom", "userReviewDate": "Aug 31, 2016", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/58878624-teenreadsdotcom", "userReview": "LIFE BEFORE is the debut novel of Michele Bacon. Michele is the writer of contemporary fiction for adults and young adults.For 17 years, Xander Fife has been keeping secrets. (Almost) no one knows about his abusive father. If he can get through this summer, he's off to college, where real life finally begins. What's more, the summer before college will be amazing: lots of pick-up soccer, long days hanging out with friends and an epic road trip. Xander also is looking forward to some long overdue nights with his ideal girlfriend, the amazing Gretchen Taylor. What is supposed to be one the greatest days of a teen\u2019s life --- graduation day --- ends up sending Xander\u2019s life into a downward spiral. When Xander's mother is murdered, his family\u2019s secrets are thrust out into the open and Xander must confront his greatest fear. Armed with a fake ID, cash and a knife, Xander skips town and assumes a new identity. Hundreds of miles from home and in danger, one thing is clear: Xander\u2019s real life is already in progress and just getting through it isn\u2019t enough.LIFE BEFORE is a powerful and truthful novel. It tackles abuse, death, friendship and romance in under 300 pages. I think that at the heart of this novel is a coming-of-age story that will make you feel. Xander growing as a character and figuring out who he wants to be was really inspiring. This book is unforgiving in the tragedies and abuse that Xander faces and, admittedly, that shocked me a bit in the beginning, but the characters were very intriguing and multi-dimensional, which I really appreciated. I do think we could have gotten a lot longer book that would have told us more about the characters and their backstories. I really loved the kindness of strangers in this novel and the realistic behaviors that Xander encounters.Overall, I really enjoyed LIFE BEFORE. It was very frightening and realistic at some points, allowing you to feel really engrossed and connected with the story. I would recommend this to readers who are mature and are okay with reading about abuse. Pick this book up if you are looking for something quick and different to read!Reviewed by Grace P., Teen Board Member"}], "description": "Seventeen years is a long time to keep secrets, so Xander Fife is very good at it: everyone believes he has a normal family.
