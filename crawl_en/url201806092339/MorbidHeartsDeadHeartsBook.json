That was before the Scourge. It\u2019s been eleven months since a deadly virus wiped out billions. For the few who remain, life as they knew it is over. Nations fell, governments were rendered obsolete, and resources became scarce. The human race had to start over, facing even greater odds . . . Zombies. Now, Cadence leads safety patrols and supply missions for a survivor\u2019s camp at Pike\u2019s Peak. When a routine mission goes south, Cadence gets more than she bargained for. She must lead a ragtag group of teens against an onslaught of scavengers, zombies, power-hungry military leaders . . . and a mutating virus. Her team, the Fighting Tigers, face increasing dangers threatening the stability of the camp. An uprising in their fragile, new home may bring further devastation, but what they discover lurking beyond their security fences could be the end of the human race.", "title": "Morbid Hearts (Dead Hearts Book 1)", "url": "http://www.goodreads.com/book/show/25155161-morbid-hearts", "average": 3.82, "cover": "https://images.gr-assets.com/books/1426528906l/25155161.jpg", "reviews": 3, "authors": [{"url": "https://www.goodreads.com/author/show/6539604.Susanne_Lambdin", "name": "Susanne Lambdin"}], "type": [], "outlinks": ["http://www.goodreads.com/book/show/25155161-morbid-hearts", "http://www.goodreads.com/book/show/23986485-vengeful-hearts", "http://www.goodreads.com/book/show/16045287-morbid-hearts", "http://www.goodreads.com/book/show/25488504-forsaken-hearts", "http://www.goodreads.com/book/show/34802423-defiant-hearts", "http://www.goodreads.com/book/show/23584481-vengeful-hearts"]}
