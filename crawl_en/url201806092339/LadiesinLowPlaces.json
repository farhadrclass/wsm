I really enjoyed this book and every story and would highly recommend it.To quote Kirkus reviews, Ladies in Low Places \u2026.(A) healthy dose of Southern humor and style\u2026told with a fresh sensitive voice likely to appeal to readers who appreciate Southern culture in all its myriad forms.\u201d I am a Northern and I can say that I appreciate Mary Ann Henry\u2019s scenic descriptions set in the\u201dcoastal lands of the South Carolina and Georgia Lowcountry\u201d. I would love to visit these destinations.The genres for these stories are Fiction and Women\u2019s Fiction. The author describes her characters as charming, witty, some complicated and complex, polite, and of various ages. I love that the author has stories about girls, young ladies and women, from extremely young to those that are more seasoned and senior.Usually I find it difficult to review a book with stories, but the author has an amazing way of describing her characters and plots in each story, and I found myself captivated by each one.I appreciate that the author is sensitive to writing about important issues about women. The author discusses family, friends, occupations, aging, loneliness, sexuality, self-worth, confidence, love and hope. She writes about the ups and downs and twists and turns in life and how different women of different ages cope with them. I had to chuckle and found many parts very witty. I received a copy of this book for my honest review. I am sure that you will enjoy these stories. I look forward to reading more of Mary Ann Henry\u2019s novels. Happy Reading!"}, {"userName": "Susan Peterson", "userReviewDate": "May 25, 2017", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/10178397-susan-peterson", "userReview": "I really enjoyed this collection of short stories! Humorous and heartfelt!!"}, {"userName": "Gail Hecky", "userReviewDate": "Nov 03, 2014", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/17414722-gail-hecky", "userReview": "Not to be missed, this little book is full of surprise endings and delightfully amusing, interesting characters. Henry is able to paint her colorful characters in clear detail with abundant doses of dry wit and charm. Ample dialogue moves each tale along quickly and believably. All eighteen short stories offer unique flavors of southern living, preferences and habits, creating a spicy mix of tales I found myself compelled to consume more than once. I loved the unusual perspectives and real-life characters Mary Ann pulls from her pen. Tales are brilliantly imbedded with thought-provoking topics, and sometimes disturbing images, as real life meets supposedly fictional personae. As an additional treat, at the end of the book the author offers questions for many of the stories to invite discussion and sharing. This collection would be fun to use in a classroom, as well as a book club."}, {"userName": "Renee", "userReviewDate": "Dec 08, 2014", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/29420638-renee", "userReview": "I won this book on goodreads giveaway for a honest review. I normally dont read short stories however I am glad I read this one. It is set in Low County SC. As I was reading about these southern women I felt I was personally getting to know them they felt so real. You may even know them yourself! I found myself laughing at their quirkiness ..this book has some humourous moments as well as sad ones. What made the characters even more believable was the fact they had flaws like real women which made it feel as if I was reading a nonfiction. Yes I would recommend this book. And btw when are you writing another one? Thanks for the autographed copy of Low County ;)"}, {"userName": "Lauren G", "userReviewDate": "Nov 02, 2014", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/36531923-lauren-g", "userReview": "The setting and narrative in Ladies In Low Places are delicious, funny, witty, frank, and whimsical. I love reading about the different Lowcountry settings in each story - from trailer park to high society. The short story format is very digestible, so it's perfect for me to dive into a great story before bed and be able to complete in one sitting. I love that there is a little bit of darkness in each story, but you never come away with a feeling of melancholy or sadness. Each character has a strength and grit that makes you want to cheer, or at least have a glass of wine with them."}, {"userName": "Karen", "userReviewDate": "Nov 10, 2014", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/36809880-karen", "userReview": "Ladies in Low Places captures the essence of Southern charm. These short stories depict the picturesque setting of the low country. Mary Ann Henry's descriptions of time and place make you feel as though you're breathing the humid air of the salt marshes and walking amongst the trees draped in Spanish moss. I enjoyed the quirky yet fiercely strong characters and how they each had their own personal struggles. Struggles which parallel our own lives in some way whether young, old, North or South of the Mason Dixon line!"}, {"userName": "Barb Hollis", "userReviewDate": "Dec 04, 2014", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/6223901-barb-hollis", "userReview": "Received this book through a GOODREADS drawing.Really enjoyed this collection of stories about southern women.

In other words, women living their lives. And they all happen to live in the 'low country.' The author's voice is charming and soothing, and the the stories have remarkable depth. The foreword of the book explains it all- how the term \"lady\" in the south, to a southern woman, is irony. Meaning that these women, with their perfect manners, have a lot more to them than meets the eye. I also enjoy the descriptions of place, truly felt as though I were there.

Obviously, reviewing something with several distinct stories can be tricky but the bigger problem for me is that I usually read short story collections over a long period of time. For example, it took me 53 days to read this 263-page book. The fact that it took me so long to read this book is not a commentary on the quality. I just like to go slowly through short story collections, reading no more than one story a day. I like to have a little \"space\" between each story so that I can enjoy each one on their individual merits. Unfortunately, the fact that it takes so long for me to read books like this means it can be harder for me to keep the earlier stories fresh in my mind.So, I'm going to address this book with an overall eye. For this book, this works well because Henry's style is fairly uniform throughout the book. This isn't to say that this book is monotone. In fact, it is quite the opposite. Henry does an admirable job of including stories of women from all walks and stages in life. You can, however, tell that every story was written by the same author, which isn't a bad thing at all. I actually loved Henry's voice and it even sounded Southern in my head as I read it.Henry is an expert at creating the world of the Lowcountry here. I've never been there (the closest I've been was when I went to college in the Tidewater region of Virginia) but I could clearly see it in my mind's eye and, yes, I would really love to visit now. The fact that she was able to pull this off is what really holds this collection together.This is a very readable collection and I would recommend it to readers new to short story collections, as well as to fans of Southern fiction from a female viewpoint.I won a copy of this book through the Goodreads First Reads program. I was encouraged, but not required, to write an honest review. I received no compensation for this post."}, {"userName": "Shannon", "userReviewDate": "Nov 03, 2014", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/4277702-shannon", "userReview": "Ladies in Low Places takes you deep into the sultry South and the life of some Southern women with all the nuances of the Lowcountry from the yearning for love to a racist past. Henry's descriptions of the Lowcountry puts you there smack dab in the middle of the muck. You can smell the stink of the pluff mud, feel the pull of the moon on your toes at ocean's high tide, lick the salt from your lips after a walk along the beach, see the divide \u2013 the separation of blacks and whites and the confederate flag that still flies high, hear the weaving of sweet grass by the hands of the Geechee women at the market. The stories are sassy and much more than satisfying. The collection starts off strong with the story, \"The Seduction of Miss Sestina.\" The title itself has you seduced with the sound of \"s\" before you read the first page. Henry's collection is full of quirkiness from the \u201cHell Hole Swamp Queen\u201d to \u201cThe Housewives of Charleston.\u201d Only Henry could ever think of ending her book with such irreverence as Miss Sweetie \"passing gas\" at her own Blue Blood socialite luncheon in the Holy City. It's enough to make you want to say Holy Shit and laugh out loud. Yet, it is her daughter\u2019s memories of racism that quickly bring you to somberness. Ladies in Low Places will make you laugh, but more importantly it will make you think and it is in that moment this collection is so much more than a \u201cfun beach read.\u201d"}, {"userName": "Dolly Anderson", "userReviewDate": "Nov 18, 2014", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/17621313-dolly-anderson", "userReview": "This collection of short stories is superb. These are stories about women who live in the South Carolina / Georgia Lowcounty, and I fell in love reading about them. Some of these women made me laugh out loud and at times I felt like yelling 'You go girl!' I would love for Mary Ann Henry to travel throughout the United States, and write stories about the many types of women she encounters. I didn't read the stories in order that they were presented in the book, but randomly based upon how much time I had to devote at the moment. I preferred a few of the stories further in, much more then the ones she started with. The first two stories, I felt were not the best, but keep reading and you will delight in the characterization of these women.

It was a good book for when you only have a few moments to read. The stories are often times pretty short and only takes a few minutes to read.
