I always feel that humour is one of the most subjective aspects of a book, and the style here didn't work for me at all. It wasn't my only issue with Goodbye, Vitamin, but it was probably the biggest one. Maybe my disconnect with the humour led into all the other problems I had. It's a book about thirty-year-old Ruth and how she deals with a break-up and her father's Alzheimers diagnosis over the course of one year. It's a quick read, rolling in at just over 200 pages, but it is messy, often disconnected and very, very random. I really struggled to connect with the narrator or her family, and this made it difficult to get through, despite the length.It's written in what seems, at first glance, like diary entries, but the narrative jumps all over the place and lacked any kind of cohesion. One minute, Ruth is dealing with her father's erratic mood swings; the next minute, she is with her best friend; and, quickly after, we have jumped back to an anecdote from her childhood. Goodbye, Vitamin reads like a random stream of comedy sketches, lacking any kind of focus or direction. We get random trivia in the middle of chapters about everything from whales to California trees to what contains aluminium to:\n\"The word testify,\" you said, \"comes from testicles. Men used to swear by their balls.\"\nAnd I think this kind of tidbit is supposed to be funny. But it's not my particular brand of humour. It's like when the characters go horse-riding and the horse craps. Ha. Hilarious. Sorry, but bathroom jokes are not my thing.We also receive random observations on life, the universe and everything, which is something I usually like, but it seemed so out of place in this story. I can't stop thinking (and typing) the word \"random\", which I feel sums up a lot of this book. Lots of disconnected ideas, jokes and fun facts that never came together into a story I could love. I also grew tired of the snippets from Ruth's childhood where her dad recorded the exact cutesy things she said as a kid. I love books that can successfully take a serious issue - like Alzheimer's - and wrap it up in humour so that it doesn't become an emotionally-manipulative sob story but, for me, this wasn\u2019t one of them. Eleanor Oliphant is Completely Fine is a great book I read recently that is sadness wrapped up in hilarity, and that worked much better for me.Blog | Facebook | Twitter | Instagram | Youtube"}, {"userName": "Larry H", "userReviewDate": "Jul 17, 2017", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/5872506-larry-h", "userReview": "I'm between 3.5 and 4 stars, so I'll round up. It's ironic how a book told so simply could pack so much beauty and emotion into its words, but Rachel Khong's \nGoodbye, Vitamin\n did just that. This is a somewhat quirky, slightly odd book that I found quite moving\u2014in fact, I had to do the \"no, I'm not crying, I'm just rubbing my eyes\" thing more than a few times on my plane ride this morning.Ruth is 30 years old. Her engagement has ended and she feels untethered to the life she has known, so she comes home to visit her parents for the holidays. She has avoided her family for a while after hearing stories of her father's drinking and his infidelities, so she is unprepared to find her father, a former college professor, in the throes of dementia, while her mother is trying to care for her father, but in an oddly detached way. Ruth agrees to quit her job and move home for a year to help out, although she probably is in equal need of help, albeit a different kind.\"What imperfect carriers of love we are, and what imperfect givers. That the reasons we can care for one another can have nothing to do with the person cared for. That it has only to do with who we were around that person\u2014what we felt about that person.\"What follows are reflections on a difficult year for her family and herself, told as diary entries of a sort. She reconnects with old friends, gets involved in a scheme to try and help her father's self-worth, tries to understand why her relationship ended (and wonders if she really cares), and attempts to figure out her parents' relationship with each other. At the same time she takes tentative steps toward her own future.There are moments of humor, poignancy, frustration, and beautiful emotion in this book. At the same time, Ruth is one of those characters you wish would say the things she really wants to say, but she's so used to taking such a passive role in her own life. (She left college weeks before graduating because her then-boyfriend wanted to move away.)I really enjoyed this book, and despite the fact that the story is told in small snippets of events from each day, I didn't get the feeling I was missing anything from the story. It did feel a little disjointed at times\u2014although there was an over-arching narrative, the story jumped quickly from day to day, so it didn't flow quite as neatly as it could have.Khong's storytelling, however, is utterly exquisite. While her style is rather spare, much like Weike Wang in \nChemistry\n (see my review), she can wring humor and emotion from the simplest sentences. I can't wait to see what she writes next, because her talent really is dazzling.For those who have dealt with a loved one or friend suffering from dementia, this may be a difficult read. But Khong took what could have been a maudlin subject and added other dimensions, so it's the story of a family's journey through difficult and good times, instead of simply the story of a man growing increasingly ill. That's the mark of true talent.See all of my reviews at http://itseithersadnessoreuphoria.blo...."}, {"userName": "Amalia Gavea", "userReviewDate": "Dec 03, 2017", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/56789747-amalia-gavea", "userReview": "\"It doesn't matter who remembers what, I guess, so long as somebody remembers something.\"\n\"Goodbye, Vitamin\" came highly recommended by many people whose opinion I trust and I had high hopes. I expected to enjoy it- if such a verb can be used in this context - but I didn't expect to love it so much. It was a novel that moved me deeply and made me lose my stop in the Tube on my way back from work. And this happens extremely rarely, so you understand how much it influenced me.Ruth returns home to help her mother as her has been diagnosed with Alzheimer. He used to be an esteemed and beloved professor, but now? He's not even allowed to set foot in the campus, a rule imposed by a vindictive former colleague. So, the situation at home is very demanding. In addition, Ruth's private life has its own difficulties. Her career has stalled and her relationship has fallen apart as a result of her fianc\u00e9's infidelity.Ruth has an awful load on her shoulders and her minor and major daily trials are described in a contemporary, humorous language that is balanced and immediate, managing to communicate so many things almost without saying anything. Khong uses the diary technique to have Ruth narrate her story. At the same time, we are shown Howard's \"letters\" to his young daughter that are touching, sweet and a beautiful mirror to the wonderful interactions between a parent and a child. There is little dialogue and many poetic, almost dreamy, passages about Ruth's life before and after this eventful year. Her thoughts and confessions, her effort to reminisce about the past in order to understand the present is our vehicle to the story, but I didn't find this alienating. On the contrary, entering her mind made me understand and appreciate Ruth and her surroundings even better.This girl is a delightful character. I loved her and connected with her from the start. She is a tricky one, though. She is brave and resourceful and refuses to give up, but she has many moments of weakness and sometimes, she is too severe with herself. At the hands of a less capable writer, Ruth would have become unlikable, drowned in puddles of melodramatic self -pity. However, Khong knows her Art and, in my opinion, she succeeded in creating a highly memorable heroine that is real, approachable and very interesting. Khong manages to compose fully-developed characters within a limited number of pages. I felt that there was an aura of mystery surrounding Howard, as a father and a husband, as a professor. Linus and Theo were very sympathetic, as well. I can't say the same for Ruth's mother, but she had her reasons.This book is like a beautiful breeze. Khong chose to deal with a very difficult subject as Alzheimer is one of the central issues that are addressed in our society. Judging from myself and from discussions with young and elderly people, this disease constitutes one of our major fears. How would it feel if our parents weren't able to recognize us? How would it be if we were unable to recognize our children? It is too frightening....Books such as this one provide a more optimistic perspective and Khong uses humour mixed with sadness to create a bittersweet novel that never becomes disrespectful or light. It's the kind of book that should be read in order to be felt and one more bright example to the endless list of Contemporary Fiction diamonds.My reviews can also be found on https://theopinionatedreaderblog.word..."}, {"userName": "Cheri", "userReviewDate": "Apr 14, 2017", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/106692-cheri", "userReview": "4.5 Stars rounded upThere are moments of beauty, moments of laughter, many moments of sadness faced with the knowledge of what is to come, and recognition of what is now the past. When Ruth comes home to help take care of her father who is in the early stages of Alzheimer\u2019s, it is partly an escape from the mess her own life has become, and a return to the comfort of home. A bittersweet return to her childhood home.\u201dWhat imperfect carriers of love we are, and what imperfect givers.\u201dWe age together, our parents and ourselves; the process is so gradual that we rarely think about this. We realize, of course, that we are growing older, we may marry, or have children to remind us how quickly the days pass, but we don\u2019t see our parents the same way. We look at old pictures of them and may vaguely recall that they used to look that way, but we don\u2019t really see that. We see them as we\u2019ve always seen them. Our caretakers. The people who raised us, and when the tables are turned, it\u2019s a hard thing to recognize in someone you\u2019ve known your whole life. That Christmas, her father had given her a small, worn, red notebook, a notebook he\u2019s kept notes in since she was very young. \u201dHe showed me a page from this notebook: Today you asked me where metal comes from. You asked me what flavor are germs. You were distressed because your pair of gloves had gone missing. When I asked you for a description, you said: they are sort of shaped like my hands.\u201dThese moments, these excerpts from this notebook are scattered throughout \u201dGoodbye, Vitamin\u201d but there is much that sweetens the bitter truth of her father being robbed of his memories at the same time as she realizes how closely their memories are intertwined. She reads everything she can on Alzheimer\u2019s, what foods to eat and not to eat, what testing is being done on the subject, and in doing so she learns that scientists are now embedding false memories in mice. \u201dWhy don\u2019t they figure out how to keep mice from forgetting things? We don\u2019t need more memories. It\u2019s hard enough trying to get a handle on the ones we\u2019ve got.\u201d. The notes her father wrote are ones that will pull at your heartstrings, remind you, perhaps of your parents, or how you view the little things your own children say and do, or did, or maybe memories of stories you heard your parents tell you about yourself\u2026 lovely memories, cherished ones. This is a deliciously sweet story, with hints of sadness within, but it is never overwhelming, a reflection on love conquering even those moments of sadness and reminding us of how sweet memories can be.

The structure is very clever - it's a rare novel of reverse accumulation. Ruth has gone home to take care of her father, who has Alzheimer's, and as his memory-loss accelerates, certain plots that would have been used for melodrama by a lesser writer (an affair; a slapstick sequence of classes) fade out because her dad has simply forgotten them. The writing is clever too, with an interesting, tender pivot between caretaker and caretakee appearing about two-thirds of the way through, in the form of simple sentences that try to record a rapidly changing person as they were on a specific day.The word \"quirky\" is bandied about so often about mostly horrid books that it has been ruined, so I'll say instead that I deeply appreciated how weird GOODBYE, VITAMIN is. It thrums with unusual facts and lots of food descriptions, and has a great roster of unusual characters, all of whom (even a deliverer of endives!) are used at least twice. Though the novel is very short, it forms an interesting cosmos. Ruth is a fantastic lead, capable of mistakes, self-doubting, passive except when she isn't, and just a bit frustrating, as she should be. The love interest (I won't spoil it) is someone we root for as well, as is the mother.I found myself tearing up a bit at the end of this. I lost my grandmother, who I loved very much, to Alzheimer's this year, and I'd delayed reading GOODBYE, VITAMIN because I was worried it would be too painful. It is a confounding, impossible, exhausting illness to struggle with, and the last thing I thought I needed was more time with it. But the depiction of Ruth's father restored some happy memories of my grandmother's wonderful - yes, I'll say it - quirks that persisted throughout her struggle. The night I finished this book, I had a wonderful dream about my grandmother. And for that, I owe Khong a debt of gratitude."}, {"userName": "Debbie", "userReviewDate": "Jan 29, 2017", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/8665845-debbie", "userReview": "Goodbye, Vitamin. Goodbye! I yell louder and wave more frantically, in case it isn\u2019t clear: Goodbye! No, I won\u2019t see you later. Go find another reader, one who will appreciate you! Yep, I had to head to the shed and drag out the old Complaint Board. It\u2019s been collecting cobwebs, which is a good thing because it means that recently I\u2019ve been reading a lot of books I love. I\u2019m in the minority here. Most people liked this book about a daughter, Ruth, returning home to care for her demented dad. It is well-written and pretty innocuous. The book just didn\u2019t work for me. Both the voice and the content bugged me\u2014no, \u201cbugged\u201d is too mild a word. The book grated on my nerves. When that happens, there is little hope of a love affair.(If you loved the book, skip this review because it will probably annoy you.)Complaint BoardI say toe-may-doe, you say toe-maud-o. When you come right down to it, it\u2019s mostly a matter of style. Some people tuned right in to this book. They liked the writing style, which I found self-conscious and too precious. I just didn\u2019t like the way the story was told.Nope, we would never be friends. I felt zero connection with the narrator. I mean zilch. I think it\u2019s because she didn\u2019t talk about her feelings much, if at all. Nor was there any introspection. Kids say the damnedest things! . . . . But so? Yes, I\u2019m being anti-Hallmarky here. Throughout the book, there are journal entries from Ruth\u2019s dad, documenting all the adorable things Ruth said as a kid. Ah, yes, isn\u2019t that clever and cute. But it adds nothing to the story. Okay, so I remember writing down all the cute things my kids said, and it\u2019s a kick to reread them. However, I will not just stick them randomly into a novel. I don\u2019t want to hear weird, random facts in the middle of a story. It\u2019s like the author went to a book called \u201cWeird, Random Facts,\u201d grabbed a bunch, and plopped them into the story here and there. What? If the author had thrown the facts into a non-fiction essay, that would have been fine, but I didn\u2019t appreciate them here. They seemed unrelated and out of place, and they detracted from the story. Giving the author the benefit of the doubt, perhaps she wanted to juxtapose some facts against the sad reality\u2014like maybe it was a way that Ruth coped with the sadness of her dad\u2019s condition\u2014but I just wasn't feeling it. Nope, don\u2019t want to hear descriptions of dreams, either. It doesn\u2019t happen often, but it still annoyed me.And nope, I also don\u2019t want to hear interesting but unrelated observations on life. I know I\u2019m being picky, and those who love this book no doubt appreciated these life observations, but I couldn\u2019t get over thinking that they sounded like little thoughts the writer had written down throughout her life, a normal and noble activity that writers indulge in. Again, I thought the author plopped them, like the kid cutenesses and the random facts, into this story randomly. (This is just what I thought. I can\u2019t help that I thought this\u2014so trolls, please don\u2019t attack me.) Hold your horses! (While I take a car ride in my pajamas.) Okay, these two things (horsebacking riding, and later, a car ride in PJs) are not related in any way but both really drove me nuts. Super super minor, and neither activity hardly took up any space\u2014but they go on my Complaint Board anyway.Okay, horses first. Ruth and her buds arranged for her dad to teach a fake college course, because he no longer was allowed to teach a real class. This was very sweet. (Seriously, I did think it was sweet.) Someone got the bright idea to hold one of the classes on horseback because the subject of that particular class was the Pony Express. In the very next paragraph, there goes dad and the crew riding horses. Wait a minute. Come on, how many people do you know who have instant access to a bunch of horses? And if they did have access, there should have been at least one or two transitional paragraphs to get them to the horses\u2014if they happen to live anywhere near a horseback riding facility in the first place. I don\u2019t know about you, but there\u2019s not one in my \u2018burb that I know of. And I don\u2019t know one adult (who isn\u2019t totally into horses) who ever just goes horseback riding, all la-dee-da. Here\u2019s how it goes:\u201cBut wouldn\u2019t it be educational to have class on horseback? we suggest to Dad. He agrees happily.\"Very next sentence:\"On horseback, Dad attempts to shout educational details about the Pony Express.\u201dAnd as an aside, because I just can\u2019t resist complaining about the whole horse scene, here is part of the next paragraph: \u201cSome shit falls out of its butt and we avoid it.\u201dRelevance? Was this really an image we needed? And surely this added nothing to the story\u2014we don\u2019t need to know about a horse pooping, sorry. I\u2019m assuming the writer is trying to be funny. I just wasn\u2019t laughing. Bathroom jokes aren\u2019t my favorite thing anyway.To make matters even more unbelievable, they happen to run into the unsympathetic department chairman, who also happens to be horseback riding at the very same place on the very same day at the very same time. Ludicrous ludicrous ludicrous. (I know I have to stop talking about horses, especially since the big beasts only took up a couple of pages. And how can I be critical of the writer adding random facts when I digress and can\u2019t shut up?)Okay, onto the pajamas, which are a pretty anti-climactic follow-up to the horse manure. I don\u2019t have a lot to say about the pajamas, just that there was a logistical problem. Ruth\u2019s friend Bonnie was in her pajamas. The next paragraph starts with \u201cShe got in the car and I drove.\u201d They travel all over the place. Maybe it\u2019s common for people to go on trips in their pajamas? So yes, I could be getting a little too nit-picky here. It just seemed like she should have had Bonnie go in and change into clothes first\u2014the editor in me would have been a lot happier.(In a book I loved, The Storied Life of A.J. Fikry, there was a guy who ran around town in PJs. That scene made my Complaint Board, too. So see, I\u2019m not just picking on this book. Or maybe I just have a problem with people running around outside in their pajamas. Very possible.)As I said, this book seemed to resonate with most people. And I will say that I was totally seduced by the first sentence:\u201cTonight a man found Dad\u2019s pants in a tree that was lit with still-hanging Christmas lights.\"Unfortunately, the seduction ended there.

Poignant and bittersweetI wasn\u2019t sure if I had the emotional wherewithal right now to read a novel that most assuredly would lean toward the depressing side. But, on occasion, I simply can't resist a publishing push and with less than two hundred pages I figured I could handle whatever emotional punches were thrown my way. Once I started reading the book, however, I found the tone to be lighter than I had anticipated, and soon found myself wrapped up in Ruth\u2019s year long journey- Ruth\u2019s mother invited her to move back home after her father begins exhibiting signs of dementia. Having just broken up with her fianc\u00e9, feeling at loose ends, Ruth accepts the invitation and moves back home for a year. Ruth\u2019s narration is often flighty, meandering, disjointed, and disorganized, as she works through her personal heartbreak, her mother\u2019s disappointments, and of course her father\u2019s battle to keep his mind sharp and stay active as long as possible. While Ruth is really hurting, she is also determined, treading into uncharted territory, discovering her parents weren\u2019t perfect, but learning to see them in a new, more mature light, as she must now be the adult in the home. She reconnects with old friends, her brother, Linus, and comes to realize despite his foibles, she is the light of her father\u2019s life, the apple of his eye. \"Sharing things is how things get started, and not sharing things is how they end.\u201dThe discovery of her father\u2019s diary which detailed conversations he had with Ruth when she was a child, was charming, often hilarious and sweet, but also a little sad.

That the reasons we can care for one another can have nothing to do with the person cared for. That it has only to do with who we were around that person - what we felt about that person.\"\nThere are tiny pieces of the novel that are pieces of journals of her father, observations he made about her when she was a child and would say something accidentally clever or funny. The novel shifts to include more of these from her perspective about her father, and more and more to the present moment without the history. This may seem confusing or small but I think anyone who has been even a partial companion to a parent dealing with a permanent or terminal illness will recognize this type of world. It becomes so small, so fast, and unless you focus on these tiny moments of observation and amusement, all it is is the disease and the loss. So for me, this book is not the least bit shallow, but the natural companion to a very hard time.I also just loved the tiny asides and comments... it reminded me of the tone of a lot of my emails, actually. Maybe I just found myself a lot in this book.\"Lately my thing is inventing new yoga poses. The Onion is one.

There's a sort of wispy melancholy that never becomes too maudlin. Particularly lovely are the little observances that the dad makes about his little girl in his journal: Today, when I told you to behave, you roared angrily: I'M BEING HAVE.Today I had to stop by the post office, and you looked around and said, aghast, \"This is errands?\"Today you were so readily impressed by me.There are many of these throughout the book, which are later mirrored by the adult daughter's similar observations about her elderly father.Entirely real and relatable, my only criticism is that the latter part of the book felt too rushed. I can see the stylistic choice behind it (the pace picks up as dad's mental state deteriorates) but it felt a little underdeveloped as a result.

Told in journal entry format, the novel follows one year in the life of Ruth, who, reeling from a break-up, goes home to help her mother take care of her father who is suffering from Alzheimer\u2019s. She has avoided her family for years, as her father was a drinker and cheated on her mom. Throughout the novel are snippets of journal entries of her father\u2019s from when Ruth was a child. The wonder of the world through a child\u2019s eyes is seen, as many of the entries are the cute, funny, and endearing things children say. The love her father has for her shines through. It helps Ruth, and the reader, see her dad with new eyes. The themes of family, love, forgiveness, friendship, and of course, memory, are explored.Most of Ruth's journal entries are small snippets of her day, in conversational narrative. A fun aspect of the novel is how Ruth researches AD and attempts to slow down the progression of her father\u2019s Alzheimer\u2019s through vitamins, oddball recipes (jellyfish), and superfoods. Food plays an important role in the novel.The comic relief is what keeps this novel from being maudlin. Ruth\u2019s wry observations and her imperfect family can be quite funny. The truths the book contains are never heavy-handed or manipulative. I love it when an author trusts the reader to \u201cget it\u201d.

I am very much of the belief that anything can be made funny, even Alzheimer's, so this novel sounded right up my alley. I quickly discovered however that this isn't a comic novel about Alzheimer's, it's a comic novel featuring Alzheimer's. But this didn't put me off, Rachel Khong's hilarious worldview kept me going throughout this short novel.The plot revolves around Ruth, a woman who has reached her mid-life crisis at age thirty, who decides to pause her life for one year to act as carer for her father who has Alzeimher's. The novel takes the form of her day-by-day diary. The weakest aspect of this novel is by far the plot. The novel trundles along with a story that is somewhat unbelievable and, whilst the character list is relatively economic, there are no standout stars of this novel. However, what I do applaud this novel for is its random observations. Sometimes Khong will just stop the whole plot to talk about the most incidental of facts or she will point something out about a character and nearly every time this happens you can be guaranteed to chuckle or at least think 'huh that was actually a really clever joke'. Khong's comedy is the saving grace of this novel, it would be a total disaster without it. I really genuinely enjoyed how she sees things and how subtle she makes her jokes, there is no fanfare or warning, she would just drop a hilarious aside into the middle of a paragraph about the horrors of late-stage Alzheimer's. She is a master of comic relief. And the novel is the better for it."}, {"userName": "Melissa Crytzer Fry", "userReviewDate": "Jun 28, 2017", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/3857699-melissa-crytzer-fry", "userReview": "**3.5, rounded up**Thank you to Goodreads First Reads program for this book, which I won as a giveaway and might not have read otherwise (and thanks, Cheri, for the recommendation of this book that hits shelves on July 11).I will be honest: I don\u2019t know how to feel about this novel. Prior to picking up this book, I had just finished reading a heavily literary, epic novel that was almost 600 pages, and perhaps the contrast felt a bit like culture shock. This book is only 194 pages (and I think you could shave off another 50 due to the journal-entry formatting and short, short paragraphs). And while this novel, about a young woman\u2019s return home to spend time with her father who has Alzheimer\u2019s, is physically small and quite sparse on words, it does pack an emotional punch. It does so, however, amid a great deal of humor. (Hence my own confused state of mind). Alzheimer\u2019s. Sad. Hilarious, seemingly unrelated observation. Funny.  Repeat.I have to think that the author, Rachel Khong, possesses this dry sense of humor, as well \u2013 and, as a result, I think it would be a blast to hang out with her. I truly did laugh aloud too many times to count (often worried I\u2019d wake my sleeping husband). So there is a bit of magic in this author\u2019s ability to tell a deeply affecting story with interspersed humor. And perhaps that IS the point: that to deal with painful situations, humans do what they can to cope\u2014often resorting to humor to make sense of the senseless. Ruth has her own life issues to deal with, and to cope, her outlook on the world is infused with bits of humor.But then\u2026This book also is painfully close to home. My father was recently diagnosed with vascular dementia, and I am planning a trip home to be with him \u2013 not altogether different than Ruth\u2019s trek home \u2013 as the mental decline is happening rapidly (to be honest, he\u2019s been fighting this for more than a decade). I naturally feel dread and overwhelming sadness, coupled with the sense of this trip having some kind of \u2018finality\u2019 to it. So it is no surprise that one night, after reading VITAMIN at bedtime, I awoke in the middle of the night feeling sheer panic, the reality setting in that Ruth\u2019s life and her experiences are soon to be mine. The inevitability of the situation really sunk in.But let me emphasize that the writing is not sensational and overly dramatic. It is sparse and doesn\u2019t dwell. And it provides a certain amount of levity with abundant humorous events. My reaction is simply to my situation. And, in the end, I\u2019m glad to have read this book. You can easily read it in a single sitting \u2013 possibly even in a few hours. It is engaging, with its easy-to-read, stream-of-consciousness observations, and the beauty, again, is in the author\u2019s ability to get the reader to feel, using so few words. It\u2019s unlike anything I\u2019ve read before.

I didn\u2019t have the heart to tell you that there\u2019s no such thing as a bagel tree. Today I thought: I\u2019m nuts- I\u2019m just nuts- about you.\u201d I was nuts about her, such a curious, spirited little girl! All children should know such love and attention. Ruth has always adored her father, but she has been blind to his failings in ways her brother and mother haven\u2019t. For them, the later years weren\u2019t full of a happy husband and father. Maybe her memories are distorted by her enduring adoration of her dad. There has been drinking and cruelties she escaped, and in coming home, with her father\u2019s memories slipping, in his confused state she realizes he wasn\u2019t the most loyal husband nor sober father.College students rally together to make sure he is able to feel important again, teaching is vital to his happiness- and this is one of the sweetest fictions an author has conjured. The novel manages to expose the rawness of family love. It\u2019s a slow understanding that is revealed about Ruth\u2019s mother and father\u2019s complicated marriage as she spends time with him and his slipping memories. Who is the young woman that seems more intimate than she should when in his presence? Why is her mother so angry and yet, she cares for him so tenderly that she expels anything that risks his health. Not that her father much appreciates his wife\u2019s nurturing. She wants to understand why her brother Theo is so mad at their father, but maybe she needs to face her own shame in not coming home sooner.It\u2019s a hard novel to review for me because it\u2019s not a flashy story. Nothing big happens but it is something enormous isn\u2019t it? The betrayal of one\u2019s own mind slowly leaving you, what is more horrible? Unlike many fictional stories, with this one- there are ups and downs. It\u2019s a decline but a slow one, and often that is how illness has it\u2019s grasp on a family- particularly with Alzheimer\u2019s disease. Memories can be mean and bite, but they can be beautiful and moving. There is not one perfect character, but that\u2019s what makes it honest. Something about this family tugged at my heart, and I fell for them. I was fattened up by a father\u2019s love for his little girl, and the bittersweet pain of seeing your parents as human beings rather than gods. Lovely.

(Just me?) The kind of book that matches lightness with a certain level of darkness, feeling all the more true and alive because it contains everything alongside everything else, the way our lives do.This summer, that book is Goodbye, Vitamin, the debut novel from former Lucky Peach editor Rachel Khong. Told in diary format, the novel follows a young woman named Ruth, whose life is in somewhat of a shambles after a broken engagement. She moves back home to help her mother care for her father, a history professor who has just been diagnosed with Alzheimer\u2019s.Heavy stuff\u2014and Goodbye, Vitamin never shies away from it. But I also want to talk about how this book is a pure and utter delight to read. Ruth is a narrator you\u2019d follow anywhere, her perspective hilarious, playful, and keenly observant. Though she\u2019s often perplexed and unsure of what to do, she\u2019s also always trying to make the best of things. One of the ways in which she tries to help is through food, as she cooks for her tired family and continually tries to entice her father to eat. (As to be expected from Khong, her writing about food is always fascinating, startling, and delectable, and is one of the many great joys of Goodbye, Vitamin.)Along with Ruth, every one of the characters feels alive. Her mother, her father, her brother, her friends, her father\u2019s former grad students\u2014they are wonderful, strange, and infuriating (sometimes all at once) in the way of people you love or could love. And that\u2019s how Goodbye, Vitamin gets you: As it dazzles and delights, as it compels you to fall in love with the people within its pages, it too shows you what is impossibly hard about love, about life. The book explores questions like: What do we owe each other? How do we forgive people when they change, especially when we haven\u2019t fully forgiven them for who they were before? How are we supposed to let go at the same time we\u2019re desperately trying to hold on to what we can?Full of food, family, friendship, and love, Goodbye, Vitamin contains everything a reader might need to make them happy, while also showing how these things can be taken away, whether by accident or time. It is heartbreaking. It is a joy. Which means, of course, Goodbye, Vitamin is a perfect summer book.Read more at https://www.bookofthemonth.com/goodby..."}, {"userName": "Rebecca Foster", "userReviewDate": "Jun 27, 2017", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/5875398-rebecca-foster", "userReview": "Reeling from a broken engagement, Ruth Young returns to her childhood home in California for a year to help look after her father, who has Alzheimer\u2019s.

It barely hints at the inevitable struggle that will grow in the following years and already has the gauzy feel of nostalgia. It\u2019s a book about memory and the things we hold on to. I suspect it would be frustrating for a reader hoping for a closer look at Alzheimers, a climactic confrontation of past betrayals, a sobbing acceptance of a love lost. A swelling of the orchestra and an emotional close-up. None of that is here. Ruth instead records the quirky everyday things that often stick out.

I read this less than three weeks after losing my father to a neurological condition that made him unable to speak and eventually progressed into dementia. I mention this because I expect that there's a link between my recent experience & raw emotion, and my somewhat negative reaction toward the novel. I considered not writing a review at all, but decided it may be helpful to someone. There may be others in a situation similar to mine, so instead will just say, please take this review for what it's worth. I'm sure many people are drawn to books about parents with Alzheimer's and dementia because we hope to draw something out of it to help us understand our own struggle watching our loved ones' slowly slip away. For me, this was somewhat difficult to get through. Ruth, the main character, agrees to quit her job and move in with her parents so that she can be her father's catetaker while her mother is working. It's written in an epistolary style, like journal entries, as we understand what is happening in her life over the course of a year. I think the coldness of that style made it hard for me to get into. I was also distracted by the practical improbability of how this 30 year old woman was able to drop everything and become a full time caregiver for her father. I will forever wish I could have done that for my father but where does the money come from?
