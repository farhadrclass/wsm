It was first published in Russia in 2011, and as with all of the Peirene titles, this is its first translation into English. Andrew Bromfield has done a marvellous job in this respect, and it goes without saying that the book itself is beautiful.The author\u2019s own life is worth mentioning in this review. Hamid Ismailov was born in Kyrgyzstan, and moved to Uzbekistan when he was a young man. In 1994, he was forced to move to the United Kingdom due to his \u2018unacceptable democratic tendencies\u2019. Whilst his work has been translated into many European languages \u2013 Spanish, French and German among them \u2013 it is still banned in Uzbekistan to this day.The Dead Lake, says its blurb, is \u2018a haunting tale about the environmental legacy of the Cold War\u2019. The novella has received high praise indeed; the Literary Review says that the author \u2018has the capacity of Salman Rushdie at his best to show the grotesque realization of history on the ground\u2019. Meike Ziervogel, the owner of Peirene Press, likens the novella to a Grimm\u2019s fairytale due to the way in which the story \u2018transforms an innermost fear into an outward reality\u2019.Its premise is absolutely stunning, and is at once both clever and creative: \u201cYerzhan grows up in a remote part of Soviet Kazakhstan where atomic weapons are tested. As a young boy he falls in love with the neighbour\u2019s daughter and one evening, to impress her, he dives into a forbidden lake. The radioactive water changes Yerzhan. He will never grow into a man.\u201dThe Dead Lake begins with a note from the narrator, which denotes the moment at which he met our protagonist, Yerzhan, upon a train. He tells his tale to the narrator, who remains unnamed throughout, and who punctuates it with his own feedback, recollections and imagined ending: \u2018The way Yerzhan told me about his life was like this road of ours, without any discernible bends or backtracking\u2019.The story then centres upon Yerzhan himself, beginning with his uncertain birth: \u2018Yerzhan was born at the Kara-Shagan way station of the East Kazakhstan Railway\u2026 The column for \u201cFather\u201d in his birth certificate had remained blank, except for a thick stroke of the pen\u2019. His mother attests that his conception came as a surprise after she, \u2018more dead than alive\u2019, made her way into the deserted steppe to follow her silk scarf after it had blown away. Here, she states that she came face to face with \u2018a creature who looked like an alien from another planet, wearing a spacesuit\u2019. Since a cruel beating from her own father which was sustained after her pregnancy began to show, she has not spoken a single word.Only two families live in the small way station named Kara-Shagan, and the sense of place and the desolation which Ismailov creates from the outset is strong. The use of local words, folktales and songs adds to this too, and all of the aforementioned elements help to shape both the culture of the characters and their situation in an underpopulated part of their country. The setting is presented as a character in itself at times, and this is a wonderful tool with which to demonstrate its vital importance to those who live within it.As with all of Peirene\u2019s titles, The Dead Lake is filled to the brim with intrigue from the very beginning. Yerzhan has been well crafted, and his childish delight in particular has been well translated to the page. When hearing his violin being played by a Bulgarian maestro of sorts, Ismailov describes the way in which: \u2018the sound was so pure\u2026 even a blind man would have seen the blue sky, the dance of the pure air, the clear sunlight, the snow white clouds, the joyful birds\u2019.On a far darker note, the overriding fear of atomic bombs and the looming of a third world war gives the story an almost apocalyptic feel: \u2018We are travellers, and the sky above us is full of enemy planes\u2019. The Dead Lake is quite unlike anything which I have read to date. Ismailov presents a most interesting glimpse into a culture which is entirely different to ours. The novella is absorbing, and the entirety is so powerful, particularly with regard to its ending."}, {"userName": "Antonomasia", "userReviewDate": "Jun 05, 2014", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/6249204-antonomasia", "userReview": "Dec 2014.The joy of the steppe, the joy of music and the joy of childhood always coexisted in Yerzhan with the anticipation of that inescapable, terrible, abominable thing that came as a rumbling and a trembling, and then a swirling , sweeping tornado from the Zone.Two families still living the ways of ancient Kazakh culture coexist alongside Soviet nuclear testing, one son a musical prodigy; I found the themes and the telling enthralling, and this is by far the best of the Peirene novellas I've read.The others, to one extent or another, had that bloodless brittleness of style characteristic of much Eng lang literary fiction, and although they are pretty good, took many times longer to read than the concept \"two hour books to be devoured in a single sitting\" which is one of the press's ad straplines. By contrast, The Dead Lake feels expansive and relaxed. Dissident authors have acquired, among some readers, a reputation for being dreary (Ismailov's work is banned in Uzbekistan; he now works for the BBC World Service) but this was like being told a fascinating secret. Or rather a traveller's tale from a place few Brits ever go. This takes the form of a nested narrative, the narrator meeting the violinist Yerzhan as he sells local ayran, a yoghurt drink, on his train. Yerzhan still looks like a twelve year old boy although he is 27... he stopped growing and ageing after he walked into a lake near the nuclear testing facility.But the book is not only the story of that, it is of his life from birth. Modernity is always present in a way, for he lives with his grandfather who is the guard of a rural railway point, but the grandmothers, as their predecessors must have done for thousands of years, groom children for lice and tell stories of Central Asian folklore, such as Gesar. Horses are an essential part of every day life. Events such as nuclear explosions are framed in a subtly mythological way, which gives the feeling of a folkloric explanation, yet does not explicitly exclude the scientific.nightmares of little silver planes suddenly turning into iron eagles and diving at him as if he were a fox cub, running across the steppe, unable to find a burrow or any kind of refuge from the rumbling, or the darkening sky, or the new sun rising in the black sky, or the mushroomThe story of Yerzhan's musical genius also addresses in detail a wondering I had (mentioned in this review of The Kalevala) about how things may have been for those of exceptional talent in both ancient and remote rural communities, and modern less-developed areas. Of his own accord, as little more than a toddler, he picks up his grandfather's dombra and copies what he's heard. His talent doesn't preclude his later being a fan of pop stars like 'Red Elvis' Dean Reed, whom he only hears about via his violin teacher, a dodgy Bulgarian who's been exiled to a building site some miles distant.The account of how cut off from his peers he feels due to his failure to grow was beautifully told and lump-in-the-throat sad.The final chapter includes a metafictional playing with different endings, but it never feels forced. It is simply the narrator wondering about gaps in Yerzhan's story (told \"like a traditional steppe bard\"), just as you might speculate about an interesting person you'd met briefly. There are, if you wish, allegories evidently to be found here - but if you like a folk-influenced story that does not spare the grit, this is a wonderful book on its own merits."}, {"userName": "Lori", "userReviewDate": "Feb 26, 2018", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/38455557-lori", "userReview": "Velmi p\u0159\u00edjmen\u00e1 jednohubka.

An intro tells the reader that from 1949 to 1989 468 nuclear explosions were tested in a test site in the Kazakh steppes. This story tells of Yerzhan a 27 year old man who looks like a 12 year old boy whom the narrator meets on a train selling yoghurt and playing his violin. He then tells the story of his and his families exposure to nuclear radiation. Part folk tale with magical elements it has a love story within it and a picture of the traditions of the Steppes. An excellent read giving a snapshot of a region the size of Europe devastated by nuclear testing. Yerzhan is a interesting hero who like Oscar in The Tin Drum is a man in the body of a child who in a chilling scene has bathed in the Dead Lake of the title, his love interest Aisulu who lives with the family next to his in two isolated huts on the side of the remote railway is also affected.

After overcoming his initial diffidence, Yerzhan starts to recount the tale of his childhood. He recalls growing up in a two-family settlement on a lonely, remote railway outpost in the Kazakh steppes, close to a top-secret \u201cZone\u201d where Soviet nuclear experiments were carried out. He tells of his precocious musical talents on the dombra [folk fiddle] and the violin, and his equally precocious love for his neighbour Aisulu. Chillingly, he recalls a fateful day when, during a school outing to the \u201cZone\u201d, he waded into a radioactive lake to impress his classmates. Did the poisonous waters stunt his growth or was some other-worldly spell cast on him? I suppose Hamid Ismailov\u2019s novella might be regarded as a work of \u201cmagical realism\u201d. I would prefer to describe it as a modern-day fable or myth. For what is mythology, if not an attempt to describe and explain the world through stories and symbols? In this case, Ismailov conjures up images of terrible beauty, by means of which he evokes daily life in the Kazakh steppes at the height of the Cold War. Andrew Bromfield's sensitive translation from the original Russian retains a poetic feel to it, as if the prose were permeated with the strains of Yerzhan\u2019s dombra. A haunting coming-of-age novel about a boy who does not come of age, this is my favourite amongst the Peirene Press publications I have had the pleasure to read."}, {"userName": "R\u00f8bert", "userReviewDate": "Jan 06, 2016", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/51145576-r-bert", "userReview": "In a Zweig-like framing device, the story is told in the course of a train journey through Kazakhstan. The story involves a boy growing up in an isolated location close to a Soviet nuclear testing site, and the effect this has on him and his family, as they nevertheless continue with their lives (schooling, friendship, musical talent, farming). Tragedy strikes early in the boy's life after a dip in a toxic lake causes him to stop growing; meanwhile, by contrast, his uncle insists on the Soviet progress in \"catching up and overtaking the Americans\". His family, unaware of the toxic lake incident, each have differing perspectives on the muffled adulterous relations among the two neighbouring families, and their own causes and cures for his arrested development.Sounds depressing? Well maybe, but the book is so rich in lush language that it is a quite beautiful story. It is steeped (or steppe-d perhaps) in the strong oral traditions of Central Asia, and local legends are woven in, as the characters attempt to make sense of events. Although it is far from my experience, Andrew Bromfield's translation vividly evokes the wide landscapes, wildlife, and characters of the region. Overall, a beautiful little book on the overlooked local lives affected by distant politics, a theme which bears examination throughout time."}, {"userName": "Lit Review", "userReviewDate": "Dec 15, 2016", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/62564314-lit-review", "userReview": "Ultimately, the greatest problem of the novella is its abysmal failure at engaging the reader.

In their ensuing conversation, it transpires that the musician is no child but a twenty-seven year old man, and as the journey continues, Yerezhan tells of his life...In a tiny hamlet (just two households), the boy had a happy enough childhood- he describes hunting, the rural Kazakh lifestyle, his lovely playmate, Aisulu, and his early musical aptitude. But not far off is 'the Zone', where nuclear experiments are carried out regularly and without warning, and where - on a school trip - the boy sees 'the Dead Lake':\"It was a beautiful lake that had formed after the explosion of an atomic bomb. A fairy-tale lake, right there in the middle of the flat, level steppe, a stretch of emerald-green water, reflecting the rare, stray cloud. No movement, no waves, no ripples, no trembling - a bottle-green, glassy surface with only cautious reflections of the boys' and girls' faces as they peeped at its bottom by the shore. Could there possibly be some fairy-tale fish or monster of the deep to be found in this static, dense water?\"Interesting, some good descriptions of a distant part of the world, but didn't massively engage with the writing."}, {"userName": "Andrew", "userReviewDate": "Apr 03, 2014", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/1824367-andrew", "userReview": "How do you tell the story of a remote injustice to a jaded world?You could make a documentary, or interview the survivors and write a 15,000-word magazine expos\u00e9. You could petition the authorities to commission an official enquiry, and wait a decade or two for the results. Hamid Ismailov chose to write a lyrical literary fairytale about a boy who swam in a forbidden lake and never grew up.The injustice in question is the detonation of 468 nuclear bombs in four decades of testing at the Semipalatinsk Nuclear Test Site in Soviet Kazakhstan, unleashing a total of 2,500 times the force of the Hiroshima bomb on the local population.If I tell you the bare bones of the story, it\u2019ll sound melodramatic. A young, preternaturally gifted musician is exposed to radiation, killing not only his dreams of the conservatoire but also his planned future with his childhood sweetheart, and ends up as a yoghurt vendor on the trains across the steppes.But Ismailov doesn\u2019t tell it that way at all. The musician, Yerzhan, is a young boy at a remote way station in the Kazakh steppes, and although his story is told in the third person, we see the world through a young boy\u2019s eyes. He hears talk about \u201cthe Zone\u201d nearby, but doesn\u2019t know what it is. He pictures it as a droning fly buzzing around him, and periodically it makes the whole world shake. Here he is on a train with his grandfather:\"Suddenly the shadows in the wagon shifted abruptly, as if pushed aside by the huge hairy legs of the fly on Yerzhan\u2019s nose. A din louder than its buzzing, worse than the rumble of the wagon and the empty metal bread boxes followed, penetrating the eardrums of the men and the boy. The wagon began to dance. The old men disappeared through the open door. The fly made the ground under Yerzhan\u2019s feet spin. Then it dragged him into a rumbling darkness.\"They\u2019re taken back home by some men, who give them bread and potatoes as compensation, and Yerzhan never does get to the town of Semey to learn from the master bards. His urine \u201cturned red, as if from shame.\u201dAll of the encounters with the nuclear testing zone are told in this magical way, starting with Yerzhan\u2019s conception, which takes place when his mother chases after a silk scarf caught on the wind. Suddenly the sinking sun soars back into the sky, a roaring wind springs up out of nowhere, and then she sees a creature looking like an alien in a spacesuit standing over her.The pivotal moment is when he swims in the forbidden lake \u2013 a beautiful stretch of perfectly still, bright green water. It\u2019s a childish prank to impress his sweetheart Aisulu, but from that moment on, Yerzhan never grows. By the time we see him selling yoghurt on the train, he\u2019s 27 years old, but looks like a 10-year-old boy.The concept of the boy who stops growing is reminiscent of G\u00fcnter Grass\u2019s The Tin Drum. But whereas Oskar Matzerath chose to stop growing, Yerzhan has that condition imposed on him. He desperately fights against it, trying everything from pull-ups on the door frame and stretching in bed to lying out in the sun all day. He hears that basketball players are tall, so nails a rusty wheel hoop to the wall of the house and spends hours tossing a ball of camel wool through it. His family give him carrots, fish oil, lamb\u2019s livers and an exorcism. But nothing works.It\u2019s a sad story, but Ismailov doesn\u2019t try to pluck at our heart-strings or hammer home the allegories. He just tells us the story, in sparsely beautiful prose, bringing the world of the remote Kazakh steppe alive in a bizarre, fantastical and yet strangely believable way."}, {"userName": "Paul Fulcher", "userReviewDate": "Jun 23, 2015", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/3250759-paul-fulcher", "userReview": "\"Does anything make sense\" he retored, suddenly prickly again, and his question seemed to be addressed not to me, but to this train galloping across the steppe, to this blazing steppe spread out across the earth, to this earth, adrift between light and darkness, to this darkness which...\"The Dead Lake was longlisted for the 2015 Independent Foreignn Fiction Prize, and indeed shortlisted by the generally more discerning, shadow jury.The IFFP is, naturally, awarded jointly to both the original author and the translator into English and in this case the short-list honours go to Andrew Bromfield, an experienced translator. He is most familar to me as the translator of Shishkin's excellent The Light and the Dark (https://www.goodreads.com/review/show...), but perhaps more widely known as the translator for Boris Akunin (https://www.goodreads.com/review/show...) and Viktor Pelevin.And credit must also go Peirene Press, an independent press running for 5 years, their tagline \"Contemporary world literature, thought provoking, well designed, short\". They publish just 4 books a year and this is the 5th consecutive year that one of them has made the long list. The story told in the novel is set in the steppe in north east Kazakhstan around the Semipalantinsk nuclear test site, and the lake referred to in the title is presumably based on Lake Chagan, actually deliberately created by a 1965 atomic test on the uses of nuclear weapons for peaceful earth-moving purposes.\u201cIt was a beautiful lake that had formed after the explosion of an atomic bomb.\u00a0 A fairy-tale lake, right there in the middle of the flat, level steppe, a stretch of emerald-green water, reflecting the rare stray cloud.\u201dThe writing is evocative, for example when describing life on the steppe:\u201cFor anyone who has never lived in the steppe, it is hard to understand how it is possible to exist surrounded by the wilderness on all sides.\u00a0 But those who have lived here since time out of mind know how rich and variable the steppe is.\u00a0 How multicoloured the sky above.\u00a0 How fluid the air around.\u00a0 How varied the plants.\u00a0 How innumerable the animals in it and above it.\u00a0 A dust storm can spring out of nowhere.\u00a0 A yellow whirlwind can suddenly start twirling around the air in the distance in the same way that women spin camel wool into twine.\u00a0 The entire, imponderable weight of that immense, heavy sky can suddenly whistle across the becalmed, submissive land.\"And the sinister air underlying the bucolic descriptions is effectively done - the source of the whistling whirlwinds is, every so often, a nuclear blast. However, I was left at the novel's - or rather novella's - end feeling unsatisfied. The TLS has described the Peirene series as \"two hours books to be devoured in a single sitting, literary cinema\" which the books quote as a complement, but to me 2 hours was an overstatement and this felt much closer to an expanded short story than a compact novel.Also, while it's possible to write a book about adultery without needing to be compared to Anna Karenina, if your subject is a man who stopped growing as a young boy (even if here by accident not design) well known for playing a particular instrument (even if violin not drum) and where there is a geo-political angle (here the nuclear arms race). comparisons to Oscar Matzerath are inevitable and this novella unsurprisingly comes off worst."}, {"userName": "Pickle Farmer", "userReviewDate": "Mar 15, 2015", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/1257892-pickle-farmer", "userReview": "3 1/2 stars. What an intensely strange book. A totally nuts modern-day fairy tale set in rural Kazakhstan where atomic bombs are frequently set off for Soviet tests. This is a brutal world, where donkeys nearly choke to death on cabbage stalks, pet baby fox cubs are mauled to death and your grandmother will scratch your anus, itching with little squirming worms, before hitting you across the face with the fingers she just used. In this world we meet Yerzhan, a violin prodigy obsessed with American singer/actor/communist Dean Reed (whom I'd never heard of before reading this book; his wikipedia entry is fascinating). One day in order to impress a girl he is in love with, he wades into the radioactive dead lake of the title. For the rest of the book he is stuck in the body of a 12-year-old boy, even as everyone else around him grows older--a modern day atomic Peter Pan. This is how the 1st-person narrator of our story meets him (yes, the book is a layered narrative, \"Heart of Darkness\"-style): in a train station selling yogurt, claiming to be a twenty-seven year old man even though he still only looks twelve. I enjoyed reading this book very much even though it didn't change my life. It was a fascinating entry for me in a world that I know absolutely nothing about, a world where dombras are played, trains rattle by, wind whistles across the steppe, horses and camels are ridden everywhere, grandmothers insist on visiting local healers to cure their rheumatism and wordless women work all day in the background preparing dishes that require vast quantities of sour milk. There's a clear theme of modernity vs. tradition throughout the book, via the characters of the grandparents and their love of epic poetry vs. the uncles and their obsession with \"catching up with the Americans.\" What I liked most about this book is the way it invokes (to quote from it directly) \"the fear that something could happen at any moment.\" Violence and danger can happen at any moment in this book, ranging from wolves, jackals and venomous spiders chasing you across the steppe to the effects of radiation sickness. I really appreciate how this book focuses on people who are typically seen as living on the margins, outside of modern society. People like Yerzhan and his family--the so-called periphery, despite consisting of vast populations--are usually ignored in literature and the international media. They don't deserve to be.What is also good about this book is that it is so short--more of a novella (I believe that is how it's been marketed).

He is surrounded by the Steppe, a huge swath of land that is virtually deserted. He has been in love since a child with his neighbour's daughter, growing up knowing that one day they will marry. The first part of the story tells of the early stages of Yerzhan's life. Yerzhan is a gifted child, learning to play the violin with an almost prodigious quality, a talent that he cannot unfortunately utilise.Yerzhan's uncle works at a nearby nuclear facility. Explosions and testing is carried out in the area and Yerzhan's home is in the fallout area. There is a child like naivet\u00e9 in the descriptions of these explosions. As the reader we are aware of the dangers but to Yerzhan and his family they are almost a way of life, little can they imagine or anticipate the effect the testing would have on their lives. However as the years progress Yerzhan becomes aware of the effect the testing facility has and witnesses the devestation first hand.One day during a school field trip to the testing facility Yerzhan dives into a forbidden pool of water - The Dead Lake. The effects of this are unnoticable at first but as the year progresses it becomes more noticable that Yerzhan is not ageing. Tests and old wife's remedies fail to correct the issue and Yerzhan remains trapped inside the body of a 12 year old whilst his family, and the love of his life, age.It is the tale of a boy who never grew up, beautifully told, moving and almost mythical. The backdrop of the Steppe is a perfect metaphor for Yerzhan's tale, lonely and bleak It is a short but compelling read, a haunting story that has an almost fairytale like quality to it, but the fairy tale is more Grimm than Anderson.This is book number 13, falling under the 'Coming of Age' titles from Peirenne Press, but in this case 13 is a lucky number. This is the first Peirenne Press book I have read but if they are all of this standard it will certainly not be the last."}, {"userName": "Ellie", "userReviewDate": "Feb 02, 2014", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/3145939-ellie", "userReview": "Yerzhan is a young boy, growing up on the remote steppe of Soviet Kazakhstan where nuclear weapons are tested on his doorstep. He intends to marry the girl next door, the only girl next door for miles and he has a talent for music. But when he dives into a polluted lake, the water changes him. Yerzhan will never grow into a man.The writing is beautifully evocative, creating a vivid picture of the wildness of the steppe and the culture of Yerzhan\u2019s family. Their life in isolation is simple and timeless, the period only set by the Cold War and its atomic legacy.The explosions are both a horror and something in the background. Something that just is and the families get on with their everyday lives against a backdrop of dread. Uncle Shaken argues that the nuclear experiments are their communist duty; they must not be left behind the Americans, but mostly, the explosions don\u2019t impact their simple lives as much as you would think. Not until Yerzhan goes for his swim in polluted waters. It\u2019s interesting to think that something we would be terrified of, nuclear bombs, is just part of normal life.Of course, it is also a story about a boy and a girl. A boy who doesn\u2019t grow up whilst she becomes taller than her father. A boy who is left behind; a common fear of adolescence. Yerzhan also becomes obsessed with the stories of Gesar, relating them to his life.Review copy provided by publisher."}, {"userName": "Victoria Kellaway", "userReviewDate": "Apr 29, 2016", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/37575737-victoria-kellaway", "userReview": "This novella is designed to be read in one sitting and is a story within a story, that of a travelling musician whom the narrator meets on a train. I was excited about reading it because I like magical realism and understood the novella would be full of it, with the added \"Is this magical realism or could this really happen?\" tension of being set near a nuclear testing site. Unfortunately for me, I didn't enjoy the way the greater part of this novella was written. The narrator tells us the man recounts \"the story of his life like a traditional steppe bard,\" so I understand the story had to be told this way. I just found it bare, with little to distinguish one character from another and no real creation of emotion. That fits with the idea of it being a mysterious tale, told by a mysterious figure in a mysterious place, but I am used to something else."}, {"userName": "Michelle", "userReviewDate": "Feb 07, 2016", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/10434223-michelle", "userReview": "Our unnamed narrator boards a train heading through Kazakhstan.

They live in close proximity to the Zone, the testing site (one character works there), the periodic 'earthquakes' terrify Yerzhan and the many references to a world war provide a sense of apocalypse. One day he and his schoolmates are taken on a tour of the facility by the father of his neighbour and love. On their return they stop at the Dead Lake where Yerzhan steps into the radioactive water. The effects are not immediately obvious, but he stops growing and becomes increasingly desperate as the children around grow bigger.Aside the darkness and sense of doom that pervades the book, what is striking is the description of the steppe as a landscape and as a home, which adds to the other worldly feel of the story.Ismailov handles an appalling topic with great skill and leaves you with a powerful impression within this short novella."}, {"userName": "Barry Litherland", "userReviewDate": "Sep 14, 2017", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/71405876-barry-litherland", "userReview": "I love books where particular images remain in the mind long after the book is closed.

(You can read my thoughts on the other two here: The Blue Room and Under the Tripoli Sky.)Kyrgyzstan-born Ismailov moved to Uzbekistan as a young man and now works for the BBC World Service in the UK. His democratic beliefs forced him to flee to the UK in 1994, and to this day his work remains banned in Uzbekistan. The Dead Lake, a novella first published in Russian in 2011, is set in the Kazakh Steppe region and comes with a foreboding preface:Between 1949 and 1989 at the Semipalatinsk Nuclear Test Site (SNTS) a total of 468 nuclear explosions were carried out, comprising 125 atmospheric and 343 underground blasts. The aggregate yield of the nuclear devices tested in the atmosphere and underground at the SNTS (in a populated region) exceeded by a factor of 2,500 the power of the bomb dropped on Hiroshima by the Americans in 1945. (preface, Peirene Press)This novella tells the story of Yerzhan, a twenty-seven-year-old man trapped inside the body of a twelve-year-old. An unnamed narrator encounters Yerzhan while travelling across the Kazakh countryside by train. At first sight, he assumes Yerzhan to be a young boy selling yoghurt and playing the violin to amuse passengers during the journey. But when he hears the boy\u2019s deep voice, our narrator is shocked to discover that Yerzhan is an adult. The men strike up a conversation and we rewind several years as Yerzhan reveals his backstory.As a young boy, Yerzhan lives with his mother, uncles and grandparents in one of two houses in an isolated way station on the Kazakhstan railway. From an early age he displays a talent for music and learns to play the dombra and violin. School is a long donkey ride away, and the boy spends his days playing with Aisulu, the daughter of the neighbouring family, playing the violin and listening to fables.Ismailov captures the stark beauty of the Kazakh landscape so effectively it could be another character in the book. The writing is lyrical and poetic with snatches of lyrics from folk songs and poetry threaded through Yerzhan\u2019s tale.Life is simple here in the Kazakh steppe, and Yerzhan\u2019s childhood should be a happy one. However, as in many such stories, there is a dark shadow lying in the background. Every now and again, the families\u2019 lives are disturbed by the sound of explosions from the nuclear test site, \u2018an inescapable, terrible, abominable thing that came a rumbling and a trembling.\u2019 In this scene, Yerzhan, his grandfather and uncle are travelling by train when they hear the \u2018clangerous, forgotten sound\u2019 of the Zone:The train clattered along the frozen rails. The fierce cold of the steppe blew in through the wagon door, which stood slightly ajar. But suddenly the shadows in the wagon shifted abruptly, as if pushed aside by the huge hairy legs of the fly on Yerzhan\u2019s nose. A din louder than its buzzing, worse than the rumble of the wagon and the empty metal bread boxes followed, penetrating the eardrums of the men and the boy. The wagon began to dance. The old men disappeared through the open door. The fly made the ground under Yerzhan\u2019s feet spin. Then it dragged him into a rumbling darkness.The Zone! That\u2019s how Yerzhan remembered that day, when the wagons toppled off the track and lay in the steppe.

The novella tells the story of Yerzhan growing up in the remote parts of Kazakhstan, in an area that the Soviets used for atomic weapons testing. As a young boy he tried to impress the neighbour\u2019s daughter by diving into a forbidden lake. The lake was radioactive and diving into the water changed Yerzhan forever.Diving into the dead lake means that Yerzhan will now never grow into a man, he is doomed to watch his love grow into a beautiful woman while he will forever be a prepubescent boy. The plot is very fairy-tale like and the reader has a front row seat into a struggle in masculinity. While never growing old may seem like a dream for some people, never reaching puberty would not be desirable. While re-reading Interview with the Vampire, I wanted this exact issue explored with Claudia. The idea that while Yerzhan may never physically age, time and experience means he grows and matures. His inner self is not reflected physically and he is doomed to be always treated like a child.While the plot tells a fairy-tale like story, underneath all this there is something different happening. The Dead Lake is an exploration into the environmental impact of the cold war. Not just exploring the effects the Soviets had on Karakhstan but rather the impact both American and the USSR had on the world to demonstrate their power. I believe this novella was based on Lake Chagan, which the Soviets conducted nuclear tests on in 1965 and is still radioactive today. Around about 100 times more than the permitted level of radionuclides in drinking water.This grim book deals with some hard hitting topics but credit to Hamid Ismailov for producing a beautiful novella. The writing in The Dead Lake is so lyrical and poetic it just flows off the page. I found myself captivated by the writing and completely sucked into the story. While it is no secret that I am a fan of Soviet and post-Soviet literature, there is something special about this novella. I love the idea of a bildungsroman where the protagonist is physically unable to truly come of age, I would like to read more novels like this.This review originally appeared on my blog; http://www.knowledgelost.org/book-rev..."}, {"userName": "Kevin Freeburn", "userReviewDate": "Mar 03, 2014", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/13244736-kevin-freeburn", "userReview": "From http://www.freeburner.wordpress.comPeirene Press set out to publish three high quality contemporary novellas a year. They look for some of the finest literature in the world and then publish three works connected by a particular theme. The Dead Lake is the first book in their Coming of Age series and I was really excited about reading when I first heard about it.This beautiful story really captivated me from the very beginning when the narrator encounters Yerzhan, who appears to be a twelve-year-old boy but it transpires that he\u2019s actually at 27 year old man.Yerzhan lives at the Kara-Shagan station on the railway line. There\u2019s just two families living here and Ismailov gives a great account of the lives of these families and the extraordinary bond that grows in such a close-knit community. The language he uses to describe life in the Kazakhstan steppe is delightfully evocative and we\u2019re really taken in by the richness and variety of the landscape.Yerzhan picks up music at a very early age and it\u2019s not long before people are describing him as a wunderkind. He dreams of music and sees different coloured notes walking around like men of various shapes and sizes. Even the faces of people remind him of various pieces of music.He idolises Dean Reed and wants to grow up to look him, even learning to read in order to learn more about him. He wonders what side Reed would be on in the third world war. The anxiety over the possibility of war rumbles through the novel with real fear in the air and a feeling that a America must be overtaken in order to save the world.Atomic weapons are being tested nearby and the deep rumblings in the ground rise up inside of people. Animals are behaving wildly and dead towns are depicted. Kids are frightened at seeing a film for the first time and it\u2019s difficult to imagine the fear they must be feeling with the menace of every explosion.The Dead Lake of the title is a lake that formed afer the explosion of an atomic bomb and it\u2019s after Yerzhan steps into this lake that his growth remains stunted. His sweetheart continues to grow while he remains bitter and frustrated at his fate.This story is one that\u2019ll certainly remain for me for a long time. It proves that a vast world of ideas can be drawn in just 120 pages and I\u2019ll certainly be very keen on reading the rest of Peirene\u2019s Coming of Age series."}, {"userName": "Clive Bevitt", "userReviewDate": "Feb 08, 2017", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/54683202-clive-bevitt", "userReview": "A chilling tale of life growing up near a nuclear test site in Kazakhstan.
