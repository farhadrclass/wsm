Gervase finds a place as a maid, but can't help falling in love with Davis, the oldest son of the owner of the estate. When he marries a gentlewoman, Gervase feels that she must leave. She goes to work for the Nightingale family, and eventually follows Florence Nightingale to the Crimea, where she nurses wounded soldiers. But little does Gervase know that her path and Davis's will cross again...This story bears some (intentional, I think) resemblance to Jane Eyre. I found it a fair read, ultimately forgettable. It felt like it was just glossing over events; I never felt fully engaged. I'd also like to have seen an author's note about the historical elements used in the story. Recommended only to readers who can't get enough inspirational historical fiction."}, {"userName": "Triss", "userReviewDate": "Jun 13, 2017", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/399494-triss", "userReview": "I learned a lot about the Crimea war and Florence Nightengale by reading this.

She takes along her trusted friend and furry kitty companion Mr.Bob, and is befriended by the master and mistress's oldest son Davis who she develops feelings for as the years pass.Through encounters with bullies, and in one instance almost losing her furry friend, Gervase's feelings for Davis grow deeper as time passes, so when he becomes engaged to be married she leaves the Kimberly home to be a companion and ladies maid to Florence Nightingale; and will eventually work with her to take care of soldiers during the Crimean War. During this time Gervase again meets up with Davis who has left home and joined the war effort because of problems in his marriage, and unhappiness at work. After returning home from the war Gervase works with Florence and a friend for awhile then finds herself back at Kimberly, as for what happens next you should read to find out ;)The characters in the book were warm and easy to relate to, it was an easy book to read and I did not want to put it down. The only thing that I would change is that the ending was very predictable, and during the last few chapters I figured out exactly what was going to happen so it got a little taxing I think it could've been shortened quite a bit, other than that I loved the plot, and the idea of the book and its characters in general.For other reviews check out my blog http://www.booksalicious.blogspot.com/"}, {"userName": "Gerald Curtis", "userReviewDate": "Apr 18, 2016", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/5712271-gerald-curtis", "userReview": "This was my second Gilbert Morris book and I really loved it. I was sad when the story had to conclude and I had to give up my relationship with the characters.My first exposure to Morris was called \"One by One,\" a rather far-fetched plot with blatant, unabashed Christian preaching by one of the characters.God's Handmaiden, on the other hand, was a delightful historical kind of novel, not about Florence Nightingale so much as fictional characters who ended up serving with her. I really enjoyed learning some about that time in history, and found the story line and characters compelling. It even had a serious challenge to the characters at the end, with no possibility of things working out as I wanted to, so far as I could predict. A great story."}, {"userName": "Lynnda Ell", "userReviewDate": "Dec 31, 2009", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/3049479-lynnda-ell", "userReview": "The horrors of war in the 19th century make the battlefield destruction of the 21st century look humane. Going to war during that era, was a death sentence. Rampant diseases, little or no care of the wounded, and a cavalier attitude about supplying soldiers with food made the risks of death almost a certainty. Florence Nightingale's work to improve care of the war wounded is the backdrop of this romance that Gilbert Morris treats with his usual excellent writing style. The twists and turns of the plot and the fully dimensional people in this novel will encourage me to read it more than once."}, {"userName": "Barbara", "userReviewDate": "Oct 02, 2010", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/2511537-barbara", "userReview": "This is great Christian historical fiction. It contains a wonderful account of some of the activities and accomplishments of Florence Nightingale as part of the novel. She is not the main character, but an important one. I loved the fact that there was a plot twist I did not totally expect, and romance, faith, moral dilemmas, moral failures and their consequences, and mystery are all present. The only reason it did not get five stars from me were that some of the scenes dealing with the war were a little too drawn out for me, but I do recommend this book if you love history."}, {"userName": "Mary", "userReviewDate": "Jan 26, 2016", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/5063245-mary", "userReview": "What a wonderful read! This incredible story of an orphan, love, attempted murder, and the love of God all wrapped around the story of Florence Nightingale! I enjoy these kinds of stories because I learn so much of the history of an area and era, war times, medicine, the profession of nursing! If you missed this one a few years ago, please pick it up and enjoy! You will be glad you did. Good writing, good story, good characters."}, {"userName": "Dawnmcd", "userReviewDate": "Jul 31, 2010", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/1950118-dawnmcd", "userReview": "I always enjoy Mr. Morris's books.
