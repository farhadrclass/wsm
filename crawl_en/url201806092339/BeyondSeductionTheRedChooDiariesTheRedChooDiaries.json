The thirty-nine-year-old, conservative, political TV show host simply can\u2019t forget the encounter with a sex-blogger twelve months ago. And as the opportunity arises to insert a ten-minute-long lighter theme into his show, he\u2019s more than happy to invite Mercedes Brooks to be his guest again. If things move a bit further than that, so be it. He\u2019s actually counting on it.For the past year, Mercedes has been writing about variations of her fantasy man in her blog. A tall man with brown hair with natural blond highlights and green (not hazel) eyes. An almost spitting image of Sam Porter, the man she somehow couldn\u2019t stop thinking about since their encounter on his show. Now she has a book on the shelves and he\u2019s invited her to his show again. She wouldn\u2019t be a red-blooded female if she didn\u2019t grasp the opportunity with both hands. And if the night developed into something more, so be it. She\u2019s actually counting on it.But a stolen night of endless pleasure isn\u2019t enough for Sam. He wants more and he isn\u2019t afraid of going for it, despite the age difference and the mid-life crisis threat. But with his budding political career and Mercedes\u2019s jitters, can they make a go for it, or are they doomed to fail even before they start?This was a wonderful story, breaking yet more stereotypes about what a HQ book and its characters should be like. This time it\u2019s the hero \u2013 big kudos for mature man who know what they want and aren\u2019t afraid to risk it all! \u2013 who wants stability, it\u2019s the man who says the L-word first, and the heroine who is scared shitless and thinks of their \"affair\" in short-term only.I loved both of them. Sam was mature, knew what he wanted, and he was doggedly insistent in his pursuit (and ultimately conquest) of the woman of his dreams. I simply loved the guy. Mercedes was also a great character. She was strong, she was sassy, she was determined to rise to writer\u2019s heaven. She was lovable and yet a huge contradiction. An erotica writer who had no problems with sex, but when things went beyond that, boy, was the girl running scared. She frustrated the hell out of me (as well as Sam), because of her stubborn notion that if her father ran out on her mother and her, so will all the men in her life, and that\u2019s why she looked only for losers who wouldn\u2019t disappoint her by leaving. She envied her brothers\u2019 finding love and getting married, but scoffed at the mere notion of having a relationship. Even with a pearl of a guy like Sam Porter.Loved the premise, loved the flow of the story, loved the characters\u2026And the humor. The rapid-fire banter about Sam needing or not a new shirt was absolutely hilarious.4 \u00bd stars and a definite keeper!"}, {"userName": "Megan", "userReviewDate": "Mar 07, 2012", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/3783604-megan", "userReview": "Not my favorite of the trilogy (the excerpts of Mercedes's erotica writing were skimworthy, and I didn't click with the characters as much as I did in the previous two Brooks family books), but a solid romance nonetheless. I did love the parts involving Andrew and Jamie (from the first book, Beyond Breathless (The Red Choo Diaries)) planning and executing their wedding, because they remained terrifically and hilariously in character."}, {"userName": "Jen", "userReviewDate": "Jul 01, 2015", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/8035130-jen", "userReview": "I had a hard time getting into this once I learned the hero's political leanings. I guess I should just thank the Lord he didn't start spouting off tripe about how same-sex marriage is an abomination and women should have their reproductive futures decided by old, white men.Regardless, something about this book was just... off for me. The characters really didn't seem to click and it was obvious that Mercedes had Daddy issues a mile wide. Falling for a much older guy didn't really seem romantic... it seemed like she needed psychological intervention."}, {"userName": "Jen", "userReviewDate": "Mar 05, 2010", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/958967-jen", "userReview": "What I appreciate about O'Reilly's books are the kinds of characters she writes about. They're extraordinary achievers in seemingly mundane jobs, but each has a vulnerability that anyone can relate to. Sam Porter sounds really hot (maybe it's because he's into that unsexy thing that is current affairs and politics) and it's great to see Mercedes finally \"get with\" her equal in love and life.Rating: 3.5/5"}, {"userName": "Netanella", "userReviewDate": "Apr 16, 2011", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/1157679-netanella", "userReview": "The first and the third in this series are the best. Although the male lead might seem a tad bit boring, his older steadfastness is a nice foil to the younger energy of an erotica writer. Very interesting characters and a good read!"}, {"userName": "Mina", "userReviewDate": "Feb 26, 2010", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/3103295-mina", "userReview": "A tough-minded yet vulnerable heroine, too noble for her own good when it comes down to the wire. A brash yet surprisingly sensitive hero, adorable almost despite himself. A very hot and well-written story."}, {"userName": "RedBecca", "userReviewDate": "Sep 24, 2011", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/5728293-redbecca", "userReview": "A solid 3 1/2. I'm enjoying reading this author but for some reason, and I can't quite put my finger on it, this one wasn't my favorite."}], "description": "Sex didn't scare her Despite the success of her sultry Red Choo sex blog, it would take serious buzz to put Mercedes Brooks's first book of erotic fantasies on the bestseller list. And that meant agreeing to another showdown with her nemesis, the super-sexy TV pundit Sam Porter. \nThis thing beyond seduction did.\n This time, though, the on-air innuendos were just a dress rehearsal. What happened later between the sheets was actually the main event. If the tabloids got wind of their night together, Sam's career would self-destruct.
