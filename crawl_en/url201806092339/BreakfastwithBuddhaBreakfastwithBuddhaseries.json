However, whereas Albom\u2019s work tends toward the syrupy, Roland Merullo\u2019s book eschews any magic realism and stays on the beaten path for a spiritual journey. And that is what this novel is, an introspective expedition that parallels an actual physical journey and put together as ably as a modern Joseph Conrad meditation.Actually this reminded me more of Herman\u2019s Hesse\u2019s Siddhartha than a Conrad novel; and even more precisely, this is reminiscent of Kurt Vonnegut\u2019s essay about why American kids love to read Hesse. Merullo accurately and poignantly describes a spiritual emptiness that eats at the heart of our nation and our culture just as Vonnegut discovered. Merullo\u2019s protagonist finds himself at once led on a transcendent quest and at the same time experiencing denial and self-loathing for the need of the journey. The author provides an exceptional situation for the self-discovery by putting together two dissimilar characters on a cross-country American trip. Otto Ringling is a modern day Everyman, an American who is not interested in the past but who is disappointed with our moral present who finds himself with a world famous spiritual guru as a traveling partner. Thought provoking and entertaining, sometimes even funny, this is a good read for a comparative religion enthusiast as well as anyone looking for a theological home who has been left cold by the choices in the local yellow pages. If you display a \u201cCoExist\u201d bumper sticker, you may very well want to read this one."}, {"userName": "Michelle", "userReviewDate": "Jun 27, 2008", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/688690-michelle", "userReview": "What a wonderful surprise this book was! I came upon it by accident and found all of the secrets of life oozing out of the pages. It was funny, and tragic and overwhelming all at the same time. In the tradition of the great across-America reads, it offered little snapshots of our country as Mr. Otto Ringling and his sister's guru journey back to Otto's home to settle some necessary business. I loved this book as much for the questions, as for the answers."}, {"userName": "Cheryl", "userReviewDate": "Sep 21, 2008", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/1275149-cheryl", "userReview": "I am always searching for a book like this: funny, wise, philosophical, magical, but real at the same time. So much fiction that gets awards and rave reviews is so depressing! This book is great if anyone is open to what Buddhism can teach, and if they are skeptical, they will feel instant kinship to the main character who takes a guru (mainly Buddhist, but he incorporates some Taoism and Hinduism and others) on a roadtrip to North Dakota. I am changed just from reading it once, but I will again and again. Even if Buddhism doesn't appeal to you, the lessons in the book can benefit anyone: the benefit of even a few minutes of meditation and slowing your breathing; the wisdom of enjoying each thing in itself, and being in the moment; the sense that there is some harmony or direction or patterns in the universe that we are all part of."}, {"userName": "L", "userReviewDate": "Mar 29, 2009", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/1464865-l", "userReview": "Hmm.. slightly artificial. Maybe the problem I had with the book was that the spiritual journey of the main character was so short, he already lives around the block from Nirvana, he is sensitive, loving and committed. He did not have much to overcome. He already is infatuated with his wife, loves his teens with the adoration of a toddler dad and hasn't really suffered much. Anybody out there have teens? Oh, and did I mention he is not too rich but just rich enough not to need the hefty proceeds from his parents estate. His problems with life are that he gets angry at annoyances and rushes around a bit and this causes him to wonder what it all means. His parents died unexpectedly and their death is not so much an event to ponder but a means to fund the monk. I found the discussions about his parents Midwestern, farmer personalities to be very modernly indulgent. They clearly loved him, raised him well, but didn't speak to him with phrases from John Gray - the horror! It all felt contrived and artificial. The poor people he met along the way were pointed out to be already aware of many of the lessons he lacked. Ughh - suburban angst and slumdog psychology - yes, you were beaten and starved and headed towards nothing but aren't you SO happy? I did really enjoy the monk character. His lessons were lovely and instructional. It was a macaroon when I expected a bear claw, all cinnamon crusted, frosting drenched, weighty and memorable."}, {"userName": "Nancy", "userReviewDate": "Sep 09, 2012", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/1731678-nancy", "userReview": "Sometimes, a book comes along just when you need it.When I was twenty-something, I read \"Zen and the Art of Motorcycle Maintenance\" and it pushed me toward becoming a different kind of human being. I've read a lot of \"spiritual guide\" literature, since then, learning more or less about the eternal search for peace and meaning in living. But \"Breakfast With Buddha\" would sit near the top of the list, with \"Zen\" and a few others, a lovely tale that enlarges perspectives without beating you over the head with its own Truth.The amazing thing about the book is that it feels like memoir. This is my first Roland Merullo novel, but skimming through reviews, it looks like he does this a lot--writing hyper-realistic, first-person fiction, revealing important things gently, letting the reader figure things out. One big plus of the writing: it's funny. The narrator, Otto, is self-deprecating and ironic, but carefully so--he is exactly the kind of person who could be open to enlightenment, if it didn't interfere with his plans.Loved the book, beginning to end."}, {"userName": "Resa", "userReviewDate": "Jun 19, 2012", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/10331451-resa", "userReview": "This isn\u2019t the kind of book I usually read, and when I first started I though it was going to hover dangerous close over the self-help line. It took less than a chapter for me to realize that wasn\u2019t true. This book was not only refreshingly original on a \u201creligious/inspirational\u201d level, but it was refreshingly original for a fiction book. While it won\u2019t appeal to you if you don\u2019t have any kind of spiritual side (agnostics/atheists won\u2019t be too amused), if you do have any kind of beliefs about spirituality, God, Buddah, karama, predestination, heaven and hell, good works, etc. you\u2019ll find this a thought provoking read. Normally when I read a book I can make it through the whole thing and then sit and mull about it as a whole. But that wasn\u2019t the case with this particular read. I found myself pausing after every chapter to think about what Merullo brought up and to think about how it applied to my life.This is an incredibly thought provoking read, and you have to come to it with an open mind. If you\u2019re dead set in the ways of one particular religion or way of thinking this is not the book for you. Merullo asks you to challenge what you\u2019ve been told by your particular branch of religion and think about what you really believe. He asks you to compare what you believe to ideas that are considered opposite or different, and then challenges you not to make a connection there. His spirit guide character, Voyla Rinpoche, draws connections between all religions, and even though we\u2019re to assume that Rinpoche is some form of Buddhist, he claims that he follows all religions, and that there\u2019s no reason why you can\u2019t. I found that to be a particularly intriguing section, and one I found to agree with. Just think of how much simpler the world would be if weren\u2019t so convinced there was only one way to live."}, {"userName": "dina", "userReviewDate": "Oct 25, 2007", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/63234-dina", "userReview": "There are moments in this book that are great.

I rolled my eyes when a friend placed it in my hands with an emphatic recommendation. I am not big on books with religious undertones, especially ones that seem like they're out to sway my beliefs. My first impression of Buddha was that it would be an attempt to do just that.Well...book, judge, cover, etc...was I wrong. This book was hilarious, inspirational, thought-provoking and emotional. I felt like I was riding along in the car with Otto and Volya Rinpoche, and a part of every insightful adventure they happened upon.

I wasn't in the mood for this book... As a friend said, the author does too much navel gazing.\" I'm glad Merullo is a \"seeker of enlightenment\", but nothing happened in the book. The 2 main characters, the ordinary middle aged successful \"author/editor\" and the \"guru\" he travels with, are not very interesting. The guru's language skills are mediocre, as are all the conversations - and that's what makes up most of the book.

I've read it twice and it impressed me in different ways each time. The story is about an upper middle-class man in a happy marriage with kids he loves. But when his parents are killed in a car accident, he begins to doubt that his comfortable life is all there is. He has to go back to North Dakota, where he grew up, to take care of the estate, and his \u201cflaky\u201d sister contrives to have her guru come along for the ride. The guru is a \u201cRinpoche\u201d from Siberia. I had thought this was entirely made up: \u201cRinpoche\u201d is a Tibetan title, and how would Tibetan Buddhism get to Siberia, I wondered. But, according to Wikipedia, in fact, there is a branch of Tibetan Buddhism there, and there was persecution in the Stalinist era, just as the Rinpoche describes.The triumph here, though, is in the characterization. Both Otto, the protagonist and first person narrator, and the Rinpoche are likable, and the Rinpoche is also very funny. We get to see Otto change from a skeptical person to one who sees that the Rinpoche is offering him something of value. And when he has his first experience of \u201cextinction\u201d on a yoga mat (this Rinpoche does a bit of everything!), Otto finally understands that there is a realm of consciousness that the Rinpoche understands but he doesn't. And he is now ready to learn.At the same time as the story is about Otto's inner journey, though, it is also about an outer journey. After a couple of days of verbal sparring, the Rinpoche and Otto make a deal: Rinpoche will show Otto the inner world and Otto will show Rinpoche the United States \u2013 at least the part they are traveling through. So we also have a travelogue. And since much of what is seen is through the eyes of Rinpoche, this gives Merullo the chance to present our country as though seen for the first time. For example, the one scene I remembered from my first reading is when the two take a boat up the Chicago River, and the announcer explains how they made the river run the other way in order that its filth wouldn't flow into the lake. Rinpoche mumbles, \u201cThey made the river run the other way.\u201d Then he wonders why they didn't just clean up the river. \u201cToo hard, I guess,\u201d Otto replies.There is so much more in this book, but I'll stop here and just say, Read it!"}, {"userName": "Mira Margitta", "userReviewDate": "Aug 05, 2017", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/62320893-mira-margitta", "userReview": "Malo filozofije,malo humora i eto zabavne price .\ud83d\ude0a\ud83d\ude0a"}, {"userName": "Vonia", "userReviewDate": "Jun 26, 2015", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/5204784-vonia", "userReview": "I have a few mixed feelings on this one. The road trip Ottis Ringling sets out on from New York to North Dakota is not so much what makes the novel's story; it is actually the vessel in which the author interweaves philosophical ramblings, the meaning of life ponderings, Christian sentiments, and Buddhist beliefs. I have the hypothesis that these are, moreover, his own beliefs. Did I agree with some of these? Yes. But a lot of them were extreme, maybe making things a little over simplified. Yes, I can see the appeal of all of this to some individuals. I have always said that I truly envy some Christians / religious individuals out there . They have the security, the comfort that there is a purpose in life, that they have somewhere to go after this world, that there is a meaning to life that has been pre-determined: to serve Him. In the dark times (surprise- most Christians convert/begin really believing when difficult times begin), they can feel better with the comfort that there is a \"path\". Good loves them. As an agnostic (not an atheist), I can appreciate the general beliefs in doing good in this world . I agree, like the Christian teachings, that we should love one another, treat others as we would like to be treated. I do not, however, agree with any of the Evangelicals whom insist on pushing this belief on all the world, often furthermore damning, condemning those whom refuse to accede to their religion and somewhat unbelievable, illogical religious beliefs. Religion is based on faith. No logic. Empty, pure, simple, straightforward faith. Therefore, not something you can force into others. That being said, although there were many references to said teachings, for the most part, \"Breakfast With Buddha\" remained open-minded. Maybe it is me being defensive- I did, after all, choose to read this- but I felt like it was a subtle subliminal messaging the author was using. Fine overall, but definitely preachy more than a few times. Next, Volya Ripnoche's admittedly \"random\" comprehension of the English language was an \"annoyant\". His stereotypically portrayed poor English was, very quickly, a pain to read. Especially when it was discovered that he could use it perfectly well at times, better during his sermons, near perfect in his published texts. My favorite musings were actually those in which Ottis the skeptical questioned within himself why he was angry about let much what I have addressed above, as I could completely see myself in his words. It is true. They often see themselves as better than everyone else. As if they have the answer to life. That their approach to life is superior to ours. They often audaciously make these claims having been introduced to someone moments ago! Yes, Buddha says to best not be angered by others which you have no power over. Amen. Agreed. That is, until these \"others\" begin forcing their beliefs onto others. I have no issues with them having their ideas. I may not agree with them, but that does not mean that I am unable to respect them. Other musings, such as life being a glass of water with dirt (Negativity in life is equated to a swirl the water. The water represents your mind. The dirt clouds the water; therefore, your mind. The more seriously you err, the more dirt is swirled in, the more your mind is clouded. Likewise, things like love have the power to clear the water) were actually a new way to look at things and a welcome perspective to ponder. The road trip aspect was a lot of fun, as I have always been a great lover of them. Annoyingly taking advantage of this all the more, or the hidden gems mentioned that I have ventured to myself but a few years ago. These include the suburbs of Cleveland, Ohio (not to miss The Rock & Roll Hall of Fame, Chef Michael Symon's Lola, & American Greetings' Headquarters, the creators to Holly Hobbie, Strawberry Shortcake, but- most significantly, of course- The Care Bears!), Pennsylvania Amish/Dutch Country, including the little town of Lilitz, Pennsylvania (not mentioned here, but adorable pretzel factory there, also a wolf sanctuary!), & Hershey, Pennsylvania (The Hershey simulation ride, the tour of the great Milton Hershey's legacy, his school built for disadvantaged youth, to which almost all his fortunes were left). Their time in Chicago also stirred some nostalgia into my evening, Cubs game @ Wrigley Field (against the Phanatic, the undisputed No. One Mascot ever!), the architectural your in The Chicago River. Like I mentioned, mixed feelings. Enough good to be interested in the sequel? I shall leave that as a \"maybe\" for the day...."}, {"userName": "Jim", "userReviewDate": "Oct 20, 2011", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/6639416-jim", "userReview": "Have you ever been stuck in a car with a middle-aged man having a mid-life crisis? Oh, and did I mention, he's got a famous guru along for the ride? That's about what Breakfast with Buddha feels like . . . not that it is all bad. In fact, the guru's explanation of life being like a glass of water with dirt stirred up in it might make the entire journey worthwhile by itself.Overall, this was a light read with a few good tidbits of \"Buddhist\" thinking tossed in now and then. Those thoughts, illustrated throughout the book, mostly consisted of \"slow down,\" \"don't be so angry,\" \"notice the good in life,\" and \"worry less.\" I can't disagree with any of that, though I don't believe that Buddhists have a monopoly on such sentiment.Aside from philosophical/religious differences, I have a few problems with Merullo's storytelling. He takes us through a few too many vignettes about food, includes an unnecessary and troubling romance, and, most irritating to me, he overuses the fictional guru's fictional prescience to establish the character's credibility. Of course he knows what's going to happen in the future . . . he's written by the same author who created the world he lives in.So, all in all, I can't completely pan this book. It wasn't that bad.

If you are looking for a formula for a bestseller this is it: fortune cookie wisdom in an easy to digest narrative. For good measure you may want to throw in a mentally handicapped person or whatever word is appropriate for that condition these days, or maybe a transgender person because they are all the rage. Once again, this is a book of answers for people who are terrified that there are no answers. I would wager that people who love this book believe in miracles and other hocus pocus.I must preface this sometimes harsh review by pointing out that I have no belief nor desire to believe in any sort of afterlife. I don\u2019t feel superior to those who do but this doesn\u2019t keep me from thinking that belief in an afterlife is farfetched and foolish, like searching for leprechauns. It just seems to me that Westerners attracted to Buddhism think themselves superior to garden variety Jesus freaks but they are basically the same species. First of all, if you are a middle aged man still desperately looking for a \u201cmeaning\u201d to life then you have a pretty weak intellectual foundation. I\u2019ve been an atheist since I was about five years old so I\u2019m not much of a sucker for homilies on \u201cspirituality.\u201d I\u2019d much prefer to take a road trip with a biology professor who could school me on human evolution, or someone who knows a lot about cooking, or anyone who could teach me how to whistle really loudly. If I thought that the Dalai Lama could teach me how to whistle loud enough to hail a taxi then I'd pick him up if I saw him hitchhiking. Otto is sort of an asshole right out of the starting gate. He calls Rinpoche \u201cpresumptuous\u201d to his face simply because he offers to teach Otto something. Jesus H. Christ, dude! Calm down. He already knows that the guy is from Russia and has spent time in a Russian prison so why would he think that he couldn\u2019t learn a thing or two from this freak? Otto gets angry and throws \u201ctantrums\u201d over the most not-shit occurrences common in modern life. I\u2019m nothing like this guy and never was, not even when I was a teen so I wouldn\u2019t be much impressed over some hippie deadbeat who claims to be a guru. The guy talks a about how perfect his life is and how great his kids are yet he can\u2019t even get his teens to accompany him on this road trip. I don\u2019t remember my teen years being so much of a democracy. Otto also feels that he is positively entitled to the best life has to offer. He constantly bitches and moans about anything less than the best restaurants and hotels so I suppose that he would be impressed by a man who isn\u2019t such a slave to consumerism, a man less angry than he.

I am very happy to read from previous reviewers that this modern skeptic seems to be in the minority.

This guy, though probably represents must of white men in this country, doesn't represent spiritual seekers. He isn't even that funny. This book is not a comedy. I enjoyed the perspective of this guy and I have a newfound respect for him. He does seem to do all things the 'right' way. He's responsible with his kids, his bills, and his wife. I also enjoyed learning how Rinpoche approaches skeptics and how he teaches them. The metaphor of looking at life through a muddy glass of water will always stick with me.

I saw so much of myself in Otto Ringling - the struggle of living what I would consider a good life but still feeling like something is missing. I don't mean for this \"review\" to be so long, but I feel this true connection to this book, to Otto and the journey he was on. It's my journey too.Grew up learning about Christianity on my own. I mean, my mom gave me a head start taking me to church when I was little and then periodically after that.It wasn't until I was in junior high or high school that I personally got invested in my spirituality. I went to Youth Week at Enterprise First United Methodist Church with my friend Marci. It was the first time I really saw teenagers really getting into being Christian. The speakers were amazing, the music was uplifting. I felt my heart move like it had never moved before, a true stirring in my soul for the first time. That's when I was \"saved.\" They did an altar call but I was too shy and a little embarrassed to do it myself, so I sat in my pew and took what God was offering me: salvation through the death of Jesus Christ. So I started going to youth group at my own church but going to Marci's whenever she invited me. Flash forward several years - me going to church off and on, mostly off - and I find myself being less and less moved, my soul being less stirred by church. I tried out several churches but the drama of the people within distracted me so much, I couldn't concentrate on my true purpose of attending, which I believe, was to worship the Lord and open my heart to His teachings.I flipped between churches, finding that I just didn't fit in. My husband doesn't go to church. I have no children. I tried participating but it never seemed to work out. I wasn't getting anything from service. The message seemed to be the same each week. Going to church, as much as I hate to say it, was/is a chore. I had questions, I wanted thickness and indepth study and I just wasn't finding it.Last year I started reading books. Any book about spirituality I could find. The more books I read that were not of one particular denomination the more questions I had but also a lighter heart. Things I have believed and questioned my whole life were being answered. What is my purpose? Is there only one particular way to get to heaven? And is that way only the specific way given by this specific church? What about everybody else? Insights. More questions, but a lighter spirit. Less worry. This book only confirmed for me something I've been pondering for awhile. As did a wonderful compliment from my mom. My mom told one of her friends that I am a seeker. I am. I'm very comfortable discovering and learning and worshiping and being open to God and His wisdom through various means instead of one strict guideline set by one specific church and/or denomination. Man has put so many inconsistencies into religion that I can't keep up. And when I question those inconsistencies I feel bogged down and heavy. When I open my heart to other ideas and philosophies, I truly feel my heart blossoming, opening up. I wish I had a Rinpoche in my life, a guru, a spiritual guide and teacher. Everytime I say this, God puts someone in my life to help me learn something new. Even if it's just through an email or a couple of quick sentences. My Rinpoche are my friends, my books, myself.This books is so wonderful. Otto is written with such clarity of the human spirit. Rinpoche...even his language is excellent. His struggle with the English language, from my experience with my Asian students anyway, is so perfect and made me smile. The idea that God can speak to us through anyone at any time using any situation - furniture golfing and bohling - to teach us really inspired me."}, {"userName": "Laura Hill", "userReviewDate": "Dec 23, 2009", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/2233972-laura-hill", "userReview": "I don\u2019t understand why I enjoyed this book so much. I stopped about 1/3 f the way through, but then picked it back up and just kept reading. It felt like a non fiction essay \u2013 full of one man\u2019s search for truth and enlightenment kind of thing. It was written in the first person and had all the trials and tribulations, doubt and skepticism that usually accompanies such essays. But it is fiction. In a little afterward the author explain that he trip across the country was one he had made, so a lot of the detail on scenery, restaurants, little inns\u2026 were based on reality (and his descriptive style is excellent \u2013 it felt very real).The Rinpoche \u2013 the spiritual advisor he travels with \u2013 is based, he explains, on his readings across many many spiritual philosophies and lessons. My only complaint about the spiritual portion of the book is that it was a shallow coverage \u2013 and made it seem so easy (although the descriptions of the little bit of peace of mind were very good. One yoga class, one 2 hour meditation (which again, was explained fairly well for a one page description) managed to open this guys mind to what Rinpoche was saying. But again, maybe that\u2019s all it takes. The character of Rinpoche was very Buddha like \u2013 always laughing, enjoying everything, unflappable. It\u2019s funny that the book didn\u2019t feel like a good read, but obviously was.One thing that is never addressed. If everyone lived the life Rinpoche does, we would never be able to get anything done. What id the right balance between turning off the mind, and turning on the mind to accomplish? LSD allows you to see the world in complete beauty, but unless you\u2019re in the garden of Eden with all things provided for, or not in a body that needs nourishment, you have to come out of it.There were some nice ideas in the book \u2013 like the way saints get born \u2013 when so much love or need is concentrated in one place. I liked the model and imagery there.At the very end, he goes down on his knees in front of the spiritual master. It seemed like the right thing to do. That I didn\u2019t like. I couldn\u2019t see it. Although, perhaps being in close proximity to a powerful being has an effect I can\u2019t imagine."}, {"userName": "Steve Pifer", "userReviewDate": "Sep 12, 2014", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/19581071-steve-pifer", "userReview": "I actually enjoyed this book, but I cant really justify giving it a 4 star review as its not on the level of so many serious literary works. That goal was not the point of this writing, or at least I hope it wasnt. The problem is, I dont think its fair to rate it at 3 stars either. 3.80 would be about right, and if I ever figure out how to provide that exact measurement on Goodreads, I will be happy to comply.In any case, this was a very nice break from my normal reading list, where, quite often, I am concerned with the literary style, the authors talent (or lack of), the plot, the characters, etc, etc. This was more of a reading 'for my own head', as we used to say in the '70's. I have traditionally been guarded with my spiritual type of intake. I was raised a Baptist preachers kid and if we learned one thing in our marathon meeting schedules, it was that deception runs rampant in the world and if you dont want to fry in hell, dont fall for the seductive prophets of others gods. Somewhere along the line though, I began to feel a bit more confidence in my adoption as a child of the living God, and around the same time, it began to dawn on me that maybe those old GARBC types didnt have all of Gods gifts rounded up in their bags. Its a long way of saying that Roland Merullos writing is like a cool drink of water in a dry, weary land, and I am much appreciative. Though its tempting to give in to the frustration of listening to the 1% trying to identify themselves as a normal joe, (fussing over what to do with the 1000 acre farm during your spontaneous sobatical across country where the trials he encounters consists of a diet that is not fit for a king or being embarrassed by not being in top yoga shape), but if you put that aside and just drink in the truths that are layed out along with the unspoken but very present confidence and encouragement, the book remains very satisfying, eye-opening, and even challenging. So much so that I have added a new thread of reading subjects and authors to my routine. Matter of fact, let me go ahead and bump that review to a 4 star afterall!"}, {"userName": "Jen", "userReviewDate": "Aug 01, 2011", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/3225191-jen", "userReview": "I was a little worried when I picked up Breakfast with Buddha by Roland Merullo at the library and saw above the title that he was also the author of Golfing with God. I thought my book group had picked something from a hokey theology-lite series designed to provide self-help of some sort. What would be next? \u201cShuffleboard with Shiva\u201d? \u201cMumblety-Peg with Mohammed\u201d?I was wrong to worry. It may be part of a series, but it was not hokey. This was, perhaps, exactly the book I needed to read at this point in my life. It was easy to identify with the main character: a suburbanite dad living a highly comfortable existence in a big house with financial security, but nevertheless having a vague sense of dissatisfaction with it all. Take this man and all his skepticism; put him on a road trip to North Dakota with a Skovorodinian monk, and, on the surface of things, you have the makings of a typical metaphorical journey of self-discovery story. Any concerns I had about this being a hit-you-over-the-head allegory were also unsubstantiated. Merullo\u2019s writing is funny, engaging and sincere. The book doesn\u2019t take itself too seriously or presume to be more than it is. How can anyone not laugh at the idea of a monk in a red robe bowling alongside tattooed foul-mouthed bikers? This is the sort of book a reader can enjoy and maybe learn something along the way, but not feel forced into some sort of spiritual redefinition. Merullo includes some suggestions for further reading: comforting to know that he didn\u2019t make up the theology. For me, Breakfast with Buddha was affirming and, this is hard for me to admit, enlightening. I may just be dropping some of my own cynicism in response to reading this nifty bit of fiction."}], "description": "When his sister tricks him into taking her guru on a trip to their childhood home, Otto Ringling, a confirmed skeptic, is not amused. Six days on the road with an enigmatic holy man who answers every question with a riddle is not what he'd planned. But in an effort to westernize his passenger\u2014and amuse himself\u2014he decides to show the monk some \"American fun\" along the way. From a chocolate factory in Hershey to a bowling alley in South Bend, from a Cubs game at Wrigley field to his family farm near Bismarck, Otto is given the remarkable opportunity to see his world\u2014and more important, his life\u2014through someone else's eyes. Gradually, skepticism yields to amazement as he realizes that his companion might just be the real thing.  In Roland Merullo's masterful hands, Otto tells his story with all the wonder, bemusement, and wry humor of a man who unwittingly finds what he's missing in the most unexpected place.", "title": "Breakfast with Buddha\n      \n          (Breakfast with Buddha series #1)", "url": "http://www.goodreads.com/book/show/2843765-breakfast-with-buddha", "average": 3.83, "cover": "https://images.gr-assets.com/books/1404581735l/2843765.jpg", "reviews": 1924, "authors": [{"url": "https://www.goodreads.com/author/show/49473.Roland_Merullo", "name": "Roland Merullo"}], "type": ["Fiction", "Religion", "Spirituality", "Philosophy"], "outlinks": ["http://www.goodreads.com/book/show/2843765-breakfast-with-buddha", "http://www.goodreads.com/book/show/736376.Breakfast_with_Buddha", "http://www.goodreads.com/book/show/22662571-breakfast-with-buddha", "http://www.goodreads.com/book/show/20413086-doru-ak-s-buddhom", "http://www.goodreads.com/book/show/10460266-the-talk-funny-girl", "http://www.goodreads.com/book/show/16069313-lunch-with-buddha", "http://www.goodreads.com/book/show/22859563-dinner-with-buddha", "http://www.goodreads.com/book/show/86382.A_Little_Love_Story", "http://www.goodreads.com/book/show/664852.Golfing_with_God"]}
