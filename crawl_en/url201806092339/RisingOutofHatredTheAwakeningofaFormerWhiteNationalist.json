I'd read Eli Saslow's profile, \"The White Flight of Derek Black,\" in The Washington Post shortly after it was published. This book is largely an expansion of that article, one that digs more deeply into the story of Derek Black and how he came to renounce the white nationalist ideology in which he was raised. (His father, Don Black, is the founder of Stormfront, one of the most popular online forums for white nationalists of all stripes, as well as a good friend of David Duke.) As a librarian and occasional teacher, it's heartening to see someone like Derek Black: strong in his convictions, but not so strong that he is unwilling to consider other perspectives or to shift his views when confronted with overwhelming, incontrovertible evidence. It's also a testament to the students of New College in Florida who chose to engage with Black rather than run him off campus - and, in doing so, managed to thoroughly change his views. It's frightening to encounter familiar names in this story - Richard Spencer, Milo Yiannopolous, Matthew Heimbach, and David Duke - but even more terrifying is Derek's recognition of white nationalist talking points in the speeches of Donald Trump and his supporters, and his dismay at the damage he's already done. This is a biography of Derek Black and the way his views evolved throughout his time in college, so if you're looking for solutions to the rise of white supremacy as a whole, you won't find them here. If you are interested in learning how one individual can change so drastically for the better, however, this is the book for you. I really can't say enough good things about it."}, {"userName": "Dave", "userReviewDate": "Apr 19, 2018", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/38769453-dave", "userReview": "This is a fascinating account of Derek Black, the heir apparent to the white nationalist movement, whose father founded Stormfront, and his godfather is David Duke. After leading a sheltered life he goes to a liberal college where his ideas are challenged daily. The civil discourse that begins first with Matthew, Moshe, and Juan, and then continues and becomes deeper with Allison gradually transitions Derek away from his ways right when white nationalism is on the rise. I would recommend this to anyone seriously interested in having an open dialogue to better understand varying viewpoints, and not just shouting louder than anyone who may disagree.Thank you to the publisher for making this arc available through edelweiss."}, {"userName": "Kathryn", "userReviewDate": "May 14, 2018", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/2056567-kathryn", "userReview": "I was not keen to tackle the Advance Reader copy of Eli Saslow's biography of Derek Black my son handed to me. The name was only vaguely familiar, the very notion of White Nationalism disgusts me, biographies bore me more often than not, and few professional journalists seem capable of writing full-length books without succumbing to the temptation of inserting a few morsels of literary fiction to add luster to the bare facts. Saslow, a Pulitzer Prize winner and staff writer for The Washington Post, has defied my predictions with his straightforward, clearly written report on the history of \"White Nationalism\" in the United States and how the young man groomed to take over the reins of that movement from his father and godfather experienced a radical transformation when exposed to other viewpoints and scientific facts during his college years.Derek's parents viewed their son as an appendage or clone of themselves, expected him to embrace the \"family ideology\" and denied him opportunities to interact with people of other backgrounds and beliefs by removing him from the public school system at an early age while imbuing a sense of superiority in him. While they granted him wide latitude to explore his interests, they rarely left his side. His slow transformation, the patience of some of his classmates, and the reaction of his family when he eventually disavowed their racism is interesting, sad, and slightly hopeful."}, {"userName": "Adrienne", "userReviewDate": "May 26, 2018", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/4437648-adrienne", "userReview": "What an amazing book, and so important for our times! I must have read this book over a weekend because I just couldn't put it down. It read like a novel, but it's a true story. It was inspiring. How often have I felt like a coward for not wanting to be an overly-exuberant activist? I have mentally beat myself up because I prefer to be kind and use gentle actions to be an example, rather than be on the front lines. This book gives me hope that perhaps my quieter approach to complex, heated issues can be effective too. The main character of this book was poised to be the leader of the white nationalist movement, steeped in a white nationalist pedigree and environment, who reframed the issue to make white supremacy and racism palatable by coining the term 'white genocide.' He eventually went on to college where he met people of different backgrounds and beliefs. He didn't believe himself to be racist or discriminatory; he thought that he was brave enough to just acknowledge the 'facts' about other races being biologically and genetically inferior. Eventually, his identity was discovered on campus, which created quite an uproar. I was most inspired by the people who reached out to the main character of the book. He attended Jewish Sabbath dinners on Friday nights and made friends with a young man working toward his American citizenship. He became genuine friends with people who were different from him, and slowly, gradually, respectfully, they challenged his white nationalist assertions from an objective standpoint. The main character didn't change his views overnight, but eventually realized the harm that white nationalism was wreaking.My biggest takeaway from the book was that people can change. Violence won't change hearts, and we shouldn't 'punch Nazis,' no matter how fashionable it might be to say or how pleasurable it might be to imagine. What does change hearts are human interactions, compassion, and empathy. How easy it must have been for his fellow students on campus to ostracize him! It would be so easy to mock him, beat him up, and make his life miserable until he dropped out. But that would never have changed his perspective. The people who reached out to him, who spent time with him, showed that they were equal human beings with dreams, goals, lives, and values just like him. They were people, too, and they proved that to him by interacting with him compassionately and kindly. There were times they asked themselves what they were doing, were they coddling him, were they even making a difference? He renounced white nationalism. I want to remember that kindness can change hearts, as sappy as that may sound. I was left wondering what I would have done if I had been a fellow student at his college. He was such an extreme case. Would I have reached out to him? Or would I have spurned him like most everyone else? I honestly don't know, but I have a bad feeling I would have been part of the people who ignored him. I feel sad that I might have done that. This book offers a lesson on what can happen if we follow our hearts, ignore the haters, and be kind to those who are different from us. We might find that they are not so different after all.I almost forgot. I received an advanced copy of this book from a Goodreads First Reads giveaway."}, {"userName": "Jenn Warner", "userReviewDate": "Jun 08, 2018", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/1130371-jenn-warner", "userReview": "I rcvd an advance copy at Book Expo at a panel where I was also able to hear the author speak. It describes the journey of white nationalist leader, Derek Black, from his childhood growing up steeped in White Nationalist hatred, to adulthood when he renounced the entire movement. Black is the godson of David Duke and grew up immersed in the twisted bigoted thinking of leaders of the KKK. The book was difficult to read as the ideas expressed by the White Nationalist movement are so crazy, sick, and offensive. What made me stick through reading it, was wanting to understand what affected Derek's transformation from someone who advocated hate and racial/ethnic separation to someone who admitted that he was wrong and that the movement is wrong. Spoiler alert, it was the friendships he forged at a liberal college with others outside the movement that helped him to see how wrong he had been. It's a compelling read and I expect it will be in great demand once published."}, {"userName": "Cara Meredith", "userReviewDate": "Jun 03, 2018", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/5788295-cara-meredith", "userReview": "Spoiler alert: loved it.

On the heels of reading a book about the efforts to combat radical terrorist movements, this biography documenting the deradicalization of a prominent young white nationalist made for a very interesting companion. The most immediately striking aspect about the story of Derek Black is the sincere kindness and bravery of those who engaged with him, confident and secure in their own beliefs and optimistic about their ability to appeal to the better nature of a bright young man raised in the shadow of bigotry. By engaging with Derek first as a friend, these young people were able to challenge his worldview and educate him about structural racism, social justice, and the impact advocates for white supremacy have on marginalized communities. To do this as young people, in the public crucible of a liberal community where virtue signalling reigned supreme, was especially impressive.In the age of Trump - which is woven as both subtext and subject throughout the latter half of this book - Derek's transformation from bannerman for the cause of neo-Nazis and Klan members nationwide to conscientious intellectual disavowing racial superiority in favor of acceptance, is a work of extraordinary and surprising juxtaposition - a testament to the triumph of kindness, patience, and hope.If only we all could be as good of people as those who helped Derek Black discover his way to a wider worldview. And if only we could all be as brave as Derek to admit our faults and seek to right our wrongs."}], "description": "From a Pulitzer Prize-winning reporter, a powerful account of one young man's journey from white supremacist hero to apostle of tolerance\nDerek Black grew up at the epicenter of white nationalism. His father founded and runs Stormfront, a heavily-trafficked white power website. His godfather is David Duke. By the time Derek turned nineteen, he had been anointed \"the leading light\" of the burgeoning white nationalist movement.\" His internet savvy and political insights led the way for the mainstreaming of racist ideology. \"We can infiltrate,\" said Derek. \"We can take the country back.\"\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 Then he went to college. Derek had been home-schooled by his parents, steeped in the culture of white supremacy, and he had rarely encountered different points of view. At New College of Florida, he kept a low profile while continuing to broadcast a racist radio show with his father each morning. Eventually, his activities were discovered, creating an uproar on campus.\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 Then something unusual happened. Instead of ostracizing Derek, some of his fellow students decided to engage him. An Orthodox Jew named Matthew Stevenson held a multicultural Shabbat dinner every Friday - and invited Derek. Over years of dialogue, he began to question his worldview. One of the Shabbat attendees was Allison Gornik, who at first refused to be in the same room with Derek, but became essential to his transformation.\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 Eventually, Derek came to believe his ideology was based on ignorant readings of history and flawed science. He decided to publicly renounce his family's beliefs, at tremendous personal cost. As the media techniques Derek helped to pioneer reached their apotheosis in Donald Trump's campaign for the Presidency, Derek positioned himself on the other side, writing and speaking out against the pernicious beliefs he did so much to spread.\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 Out of Hatred tells the story of how white supremacist ideas migrated from the far-right fringe to the White House, through the intensely personal saga of one man who disavowed everything he was taught to believe. With great empathy and narrative verve, Eli Saslow asks what Derek's story can tell us about America's increasingly divided nature. This is a book to help us understand the American moment and to help us better understand one another.", "title": "Rising Out of Hatred: The Awakening of a Former White Nationalist", "url": "http://www.goodreads.com/book/show/39706754-rising-out-of-hatred", "average": 4.53, "cover": "https://images.gr-assets.com/books/1522711319l/39706754.jpg", "reviews": 8, "authors": [{"url": "https://www.goodreads.com/author/show/4816713.Eli_Saslow", "name": "Eli Saslow"}, {"url": "https://www.goodreads.com/author/show/4816713.Eli_Saslow", "name": "Eli Saslow"}], "type": ["Nonfiction", "Biography", "Politics"], "outlinks": ["http://www.goodreads.com/book/show/39706754-rising-out-of-hatred", "http://www.goodreads.com/book/show/39706735-rising-out-of-hatred", "http://www.goodreads.com/book/show/39380666-rising-out-of-hatred", "http://www.goodreads.com/book/show/11222843-ten-letters", "http://www.goodreads.com/book/show/22890119-american-hunger", "http://www.goodreads.com/book/show/24514850-anybody-who-thinks-this-is-porn-or-abuse-doesn-t-know", "http://www.goodreads.com/book/show/16498123-a-guide-to-the-present-moment", "http://www.goodreads.com/book/show/40198297-hunting-eichmann", "http://www.goodreads.com/book/show/40193094-the-breaks-of-the-game", "http://www.goodreads.com/book/show/5312677-celebration-of-discipline", "http://www.goodreads.com/book/show/40243434-soul-keeping", "http://www.goodreads.com/book/show/22561514-the-autobiography-of-eleanor-roosevelt", "http://www.goodreads.com/book/show/31391295-how-to-be-a-bawse", "http://www.goodreads.com/book/show/8143199-how-remarkable-women-lead", "http://www.goodreads.com/book/show/5440602-how-soccer-explains-the-world", "http://www.goodreads.com/book/show/40193421-dry", "http://www.goodreads.com/book/show/40204948-a-truck-full-of-money", "http://www.goodreads.com/book/show/40229444-animal-liberation", "http://www.goodreads.com/book/show/19485478-a-woman-in-charge", "http://www.goodreads.com/book/show/38272015-the-measure-of-a-man", "http://www.goodreads.com/book/show/40203910-32-yolks", "http://www.goodreads.com/book/show/40193675-recovery", "http://www.goodreads.com/book/show/18880380-enemies", "http://www.goodreads.com/book/show/36693639-victoria", "http://www.goodreads.com/book/show/40203983-being-nixon", "http://www.goodreads.com/book/show/20960501-100-days-of-real-food", "http://www.goodreads.com/book/show/40268935-barbarians-at-the-gate", "http://www.goodreads.com/book/show/26064021-things-no-one-will-tell-fat-girls", "http://www.goodreads.com/book/show/29465033-whipping-girl", "http://www.goodreads.com/book/show/19730030-a-history-of-warfare", "http://www.goodreads.com/book/show/22844509-best-friends", "http://www.goodreads.com/book/show/18939110-let-it-go", "http://www.goodreads.com/book/show/40192801-future-crimes", "http://www.goodreads.com/book/show/13576617-still", "http://www.goodreads.com/book/show/35525893-sick-in-the-head", "http://www.goodreads.com/book/show/40205119-paris-1919"]}
