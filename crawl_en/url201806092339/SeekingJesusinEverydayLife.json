Usually I like the format of a quote or two, short reflection, and a closing prayer/reflection. I usually like the conciseness of such books which get right to the point.I have been taking a leisurely stroll through this new book using it as intended. Reading a single or a couple of pages daily. I really enjoy the variety of quote sources and how she reflects on them. She has a Chestertonian ability to see things afresh and to illustrate that freshness to you. There is gratitude and wonder in her reflections that inspire me to want to imitate that viewpoint more consistently.Sometimes even from the best of writers I usually find the closing prayer/reflection more as something tagged on than integral. More as an expected part of the format than something useful. Not true here where even a single sentence is the exclamation point to what goes before.So yeah - highly recommended."}, {"userName": "Danusha Goska", "userReviewDate": "Jun 27, 2017", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/20503996-danusha-goska", "userReview": "Julie Davis' 2017 Niggle Press book Seeking Jesus in Everyday Life: Prayers and Reflections for Getting Closer is one of the weightiest little books I've ever read. There are just 209 pages of main text, and each page has few words. I open randomly to page one hundred and I find a three-sentence quote from the Gospel of Luke, a brief, one-paragraph quote from Saint Augustine, and ten sentences of reflection from Davis. The few words that appear on each page, though, like the words in a rich poem, are dense with meaning. They are the kind of words that cause the reader to pause and ponder. The quote from Luke: \"If you love those who love you, what credit is that to you? Even sinners love those that love them \u2026 But, rather, love your enemies and do good to them.\" The quote by St. Augustine tackles this challenging commandment in practical terms: we must remember that even hateful people are \"God's work\" and capable of change for the better. Davis acknowledges, \"I can't control the emotions that flood over me when I'm mad at someone.\" Davis concludes the page with a prayer: \"Lord, have mercy on me and bless my enemy. I am not strong enough to love him by myself. Help me to see with your eyes.\" Each pair of pages, left and right, has a theme. The themes are subdivisions of the book's twelve chapters. The opening chapter is \"Beginning to Pray\" and the closing chapter is \"Continuing to Seek.\" In the chapter entitled \"Finding Jesus in the Cross, the Resurrection, the Eucharist,\" themes include \"Spending Time with God,\" Jesus as a courageous hero, and \"Death Shall Be No More: Death, Thou Shalt Die.\" Each quote on the page relates to the theme. There are quotes from the Old and New Testaments on almost every page. Otherwise, Davis' sources range broadly. There is a prayer, that originated from the Helpers of God's Precious Infants, contemplating Jesus as he developed in Mary's womb. There are several quotes from CS Lewis, Thomas Merton, the Catechism of the Catholic Church, Popes Benedict and Francis, and the writings of saints including Patrick, Therese of Lisieux, Teresa of Avila, and Augustine. There are also quotes from Hermann Cohen, a nineteenth-century Jewish convert to Catholicism, Andrew Klavan, a twenty-first-century secular Jewish convert to Christianity, media theorist Marshall McLuhan, and Father James Yamauchi, who, I take it, is Davis' home church pastor. These Biblical quotes, quotes from literature, and Davis' reflections are elegantly laid out on the page. Formatting is important in all books, but especially in a book like this. Davis is a visual artist as well as a verbal one, and her careful choices in fonts and spacing guide the reader through a flowing experience. Davis' own reflections are general, and mostly free of particular biographical detail. You won't learn much about her from her personal comments, except that she is a wife and mother. For example, about suffering, she writes, \"I want to avoid suffering \u2026 I know that great good can come to me through the Cross. That is different from the present moment when I'm suffering. Then I have to fight self-pity. Sometimes suffering is inflicted by others. Sometimes I inflict it on myself as a natural consequence of my own actions.\" One doesn't know what is causing Davis this suffering, who is hurting her, or how she hurts herself. By using general language, I conclude, she is trying to produce a document that can be significant to many readers, no matter whether the reader shares biographical details with Davis or not. Every now and then Davis lets slip a very personal detail. For example, she sometimes uses a kitchen timer in her prayer life. Her description of this method is priceless and very true. Davis wants this book to be an aide to other Christians in their prayer life. Online reviews attest to its value and success at just that. One reviewer reported, \"I immediately ordered copies for the six people in our RCIA class who will be baptized or confirmed at Easter this year.\" Another said, \"Exactly what I needed at this point in my life!\" Another reviewer wrote, \"Are you ready to hit the reset button on your practice of the faith? Here it is.\" This book is helping people. I think Seeking Jesus has another use. I think this would be a great gift to an open-minded Christophobe. There are a lot of people these days who insist that all Christians are violent bigots. Jesus is certainly the main character of this book, but Davis is a very appealing sidekick. She is humble, eager to learn, thoughtful, and patient. I think giving this book as a gift to someone trying to understand a modern American Christian's interior life would be a very charitable act."}, {"userName": "Joseph R.", "userReviewDate": "Jun 04, 2018", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/4737491-joseph-r", "userReview": "Getting into the habit of regular prayer can be tricky. Having enough discipline to pray the Divine Office really requires the support of grace (at least it does for me), since the typical book version of the Office requires some jumping around in the text--some parts are prayed every day, others once every four weeks, others on certain calendar days, others on certain liturgical days that jump around on a yearly calendar (Easter being the prime example). Even though it takes as little as ten minutes, sometimes that's a tall order first thing in the morning or last thing in the evening. Something shorter works better for my attention span and my schedule. So it's a delight to discover a daily devotional that boosts me into a spiritual mindset (and, more importantly, a spiritual heartset) for the day. A great example of this is Seeking Jesus in Everyday Life by Julie Davis.The format of the book is simple. Each page starts with a quote or two from Scriptures, the writings of the saints throughout the ages (including some I've never heard of), contemporary writers, movies, and even TED talks. The author gives a few paragraphs of personal reflections on how the quote(s) strike her or have impacted her life. Each page ends with a short prayer. These reflections are easy to read in a minute but have staying power. They provide good matter for meditation or consideration throughout the day.The best thing about the book is its focus. The prayers and meditations focus on building knowledge and intimacy with Jesus Christ, the Second Person of the Blessed Trinity. The result is a deeper and broader appreciation for who He is and what He does. Being aware of and appreciating Divine Providence is a key component to growth in spiritual life. It truly does help the reader to get closer to Jesus in everyday occurrences.Highly recommended."}, {"userName": "JoAnna", "userReviewDate": "Mar 11, 2018", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/10294645-joanna", "userReview": "I\u2019ve spent the better part of the last year slowly working through this marvelous collection of quotes and brief reflections. Similar to Julie, I find my reading greatly informs my prayer life, whether it\u2019s a theological work by a pope or a classic novel, so I loved the quote-collection format. The book is divided into 12 thematic sections that focus on different aspects of Jesus and prayer more broadly. The quotations are taken from a wide variety of sources, including scripture, the saints, literature, and film. Sometimes I would spend several days meditating on one page, and other times I would absorb a whole section in one sitting. With my predilection for reading, I am often tempted to bite off more than I can chew or too quickly gloss over large volumes of text in spiritual reading, but the quote format works as a preventative. Definitely a book to come back to frequently!"}], "description": "This book is for the beginner and for those beginning again \u2014 to bring us closer to Jesus, which is every Christian\u2019s greatest desire.Each page gently leads the reader to open up and encounter Christ in their own way \u2014 using scripture and inspirational quotes, reflection, brief commentary, and prayer.Foster a daily habit of prayer and reflection that will continue long after you come to the end of this book.", "title": "Seeking Jesus in Everyday Life", "url": "http://www.goodreads.com/book/show/34674943-seeking-jesus-in-everyday-life", "average": 4.8, "cover": "https://images.gr-assets.com/books/1490369098l/34674943.jpg", "reviews": 4, "authors": [{"url": "https://www.goodreads.com/author/show/4752811.Julie_Davis", "name": "Julie  Davis"}], "type": [], "outlinks": ["http://www.goodreads.com/book/show/34674943-seeking-jesus-in-everyday-life", "http://www.goodreads.com/book/show/10876238-happy-catholic", "http://www.goodreads.com/book/show/15834049-lord-open-my-heart"]}
