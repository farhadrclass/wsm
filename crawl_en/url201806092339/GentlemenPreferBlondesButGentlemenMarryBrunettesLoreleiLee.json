After all, most classics / books known in their time do not necessarily stand the test of time. However, this being labeled as the Great American Novel is quite an overstatement. Then again, similar to the coming of age story of Catcher in the Rye, Gentlemen Prefer Blondes But Gentlemen Marry Brunettes was completely unremarkable for me. Perhaps during is time, the idea was original (girl distilling it about her selfish, conniving, manipulative ways to marry her way to the top and the ingenious resolution that men like to play around with the pretty blinded, but ultimately settle with the ones with the actual brains), but the actual writing/structure/plot was subpar. Especially this many years later. To begin with (although I understand that this was done with full intent + give the due credit for eliciting the desired effect), the audacious spelling, almost offensive grammatical errors, and plain randomness of, say, capitalization, hyphens, and sentence structure was beyond my comprehension and even further being my tolerance level. One of the more grating choices Loos made (I suppose in order to illustrate Lorelei's immaturity and/or degree of education) was for her writing to heavily repeat \"So then\", \" I mean\", and other such useless phrases. Within the first few pages, I was already cringing at the \"I mean\", \"What I mean\", \"I mean to say\", \" What I mean to say\". Not knowing by the end of page one (no exaggeration) whether I could handle reading an entire book of this, I scanned the next several pages and saw one of the \"I mean\" phrases almost every few sentences. I pushed myself to continue reading, forcing my mind to concentrate on other words and ignore this. I somewhat succeeded. At least enough to finish the entire book. Maybe some readers do not mind such contumelious errors, but I am convinced I deserve great commendation for this! Here is an example of a paragraph that would fit right into her diary. I will admit, at first it was a little fun to write, but the novelty soon wore off and I was left straining myself to create ridiculous errors; at the same time, straining to hold back my aggravation, cringing as I wrote: \"In this instants the Woman had a strange dialekt, very anteek. I mean she sounded riskay when she talked about this Doctor Froyd. I mean I wracked my brain in order to decifer what she meant. But she had a lot of moneys that she would give to me. I mean I could have the diamond tiara if I used the intelligents I seem to have always had. So I lited up my face so that it looked like I found her amuseing. When she smiled back, I knew it was do to me being an intelektual. I mean I used Psychology and understood that she did not know how to use her instincks. I mean I am the reverse. So then later she left with the ade from this man that came in his Rols Royce. It really was a Miracle because she promised to come back to take me to see the diamond tiara tomorrow.\" Putting all of this aside, Lorelei, plain and simple, was someone I would absolutely deplore in person. And to be forced to read her diary as opposed to the far easier third-person or omniscient point-of-view, was difficult. Through her words, I would but be surprised if it was actually putting an exaggerated light on the other characters. To me, an unreliable narrator. Dorothy, Mr. Bartlett, Major Falcon, Sir Francis Beekman, Mr. Montrose, Henry Spoffard, Gloria, Chesterfield. Who is who? All the names blur together, as Lorelei's descriptions and depictions were lackluster and superficial. Partially because that was close to her actual relationship with these people. All are men she used; men she married; men she wanted to marry or almost married until her capriciousness got the better of her, yet again; friends she spoke poorly of; men she imagined loved her, men she was convinced she was equal to, men she called geniuses that she felt saw her in the same way. The first book is the diary belonging to Lorelei. The second is hers again, but telling her friend Dorothy's story, as dictated to her. Both are superficial, full of themselves, self-serving, and worse yet, superficial friends (at least if the way Lorelei treats her is telling at all, oft painting her in the worst possible light and constantly berating her- both behind her back and to her face. Needless to say, underwhelming and unimpressive."}, {"userName": "Bastet", "userReviewDate": "Sep 30, 2011", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/6466237-bastet", "userReview": "Guardo un buen recuerdo de este libro porque lo asocio a uno de los veranos m\u00e1s felices de mi vida.

I chose to start with But Gentlemen Marry Brunettes instead of Gentlemen Prefer Blondes. The way in which Anita Loos writes requires a bit of adjusting to and also having some history of the era helps the reading run smoother. With that in mind as a writer I can say two things. One is when you write and you like the style stick to your guns especially when your aiming for a certain style and two when you write enjoy what you write but do take into consideration your audience. The one thing that I firmly would not sacrifice is spelling to stress a style or point. I did learn about some more ideas about characterizing through reading this book. Loos presents two very different characters and develops them very well. When I was reading from the brunette character perspective the blonde character is displayed with all the classic stereotypical behaviors and mannerism. Loos is not always subtle and to me I think it works for her style, but for my own writing I truly think that adding some more mystery and just letting it grow produces something more long and memorable. When reading from the blonde character perspective it is truly a challenge, because the hair color lives in the text. In other words the role of dumb and foolish transcends well into the written part. From this end is where I think writing shouldn\u2019t be a sacrifice to the extent of making your writing fit the character. I think the character and the writing should grow together and if they can\u2019t then one of the two needs to split. Thus there is where I can see the idea of series or series spin off or a two part book. In the end of things Loos lets friendship prevail despite all and any differences. She makes the differences stand out, but it\u2019s not in a way that bores you. To me that is something I want to use in my writing, the world is already filled with too much drama and even television is saturated with it. I mean could we get a drama test like a cholesterol test and stick it to our TV\u2019s \u2013I think if that was true it be a one big explosive mess. Simply put with Loo\u2019s style of writing I know I will want to include humor to alleviate tensions or let the reader have a break. Now I wouldn\u2019t go as way as using satire which is Loo\u2019s main style, but humor alone can lighten any situation you can place a character in.Setting is another factor Loo\u2019s uses to her advantage. When she spoke of the dining room, the cirrus rather anything the eyes of our two gal protagonists saw were brought to life. Yes, indeed there is some notion that the words used really can be outdated yet still it places you there. That is something I know I will continue to do as I write. I want my character to not just have eyes, I want my character to have vision. I don\u2019t want to give them petite ears to just have dangling sparkling earrings or long tender fingers to gracefully pose a ring , I want my characters to hear and feel and thus transmit those feelings to paper and then to the reader. To me this book is classic for women literature and if you want to get more into writing this will help you see errors and ways to enrich your own writing."}, {"userName": "Chris", "userReviewDate": "Dec 02, 2009", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/1124585-chris", "userReview": "I first saw the Marilyn Monroe movie Gentlemen Prefer Blonds as a youth years ago and have a vague recollection of it being whimsical fun but my general memory of the film is pretty limited. I need to go back and watch it as an adult and see it from fresher eyes. Reading these books was a great experience. They were generally a quick read, although it took the first couple of chapters for me to get used to the style\u2026which slowed me down as I re-read segments to double check grammar and spelling. Anita Loos does an exquisite job of capturing the singular voice of Lorelei Lee. I absolutely love the narrative style and the oblivious ignorance with which Lorelei approaches the world.The story itself is not terribly remarkable. It largely plays out as a series of humorous anecdotes as Lorelei and her friend Dorothy travel the world to be properly \"educated.\" Presenting the story from Lorelei's point of view makes her own comments and actions all the more hilarious while also making Dorothy's comments so much fun, especially since Lorelei never really understands the full meaning of her friend's remarks.I really enjoyed the style and would love to read more by Loos. She started her writing career as a screenwriter and as I looked at her list of novels is fairly short, which is a shame. Don't expect anything really deep going into these books (unless your idea of depth is the same as Lorelei's, in which case this book may be over your head). These books are a fabulous portrayal of life in the 20s as seen through the eyes of the gold-digging blonde (in the literal and stereotypical sense). It's a great light-hearted satirical look at life and romance.****4 out of 5 stars"}, {"userName": "Hester", "userReviewDate": "Apr 11, 2016", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/2151506-hester", "userReview": "Gentleman Prefer Blondes and its sequel But Gentleman Marry Brunettes haven't aged well in their 90 plus years. Lorelei Lee is dimwitted, shallow and boring. In Gentlemen Prefer Blondes she keeps a journal of her adventures in gold digging. She's a gold digger but really doesn't have the gold digger's ultimate goal in mind of landing the big one, instead she's more concerned with what she can get out of a man on the spot. After a pointless trip to \"the central of Europe\" to get educated, pfft, she meets Charlie a wealthy man with the reputation of \"senhsuring\" movies in order to make America more pure. After much indecision and setting aside the fact that she doesn't really like him or his family she marries him anyway. Bad gold digger, very bad gold digger! That's right, Lorelei Lee is a bad gold digger, she left documented proof of her plan and her feelings towards her husband. In But Gentlemen Marry Brunettes Lorelei documents the life of her bestie Dorothy. This story is slightly more interesting. Dorothy was raised in a traveling carnival with neglectful parents, prefers sketchy low lifes to gentlemen, was preyed upon by a pervy sheriff, has no refinement, lands a spot as a chorus girl in the Ziegfeld Follies marries a saxophone player, has a violent marriage, gets framed for dope possession and finally marries rich after her suitor starts to treat her like dirt. Both stories suffer from unreliable narration from Lorelei, for someone who wasn't there for a lot of Dorothy's story she sure has the inside track especially the behind the scenes machinations of Dorothy's suitor's mother trying to keep her son away from her. Edith Wharton called Gentlemen Prefer Blondes the great American novel, sorry Edith, not even close."}, {"userName": "Cissa", "userReviewDate": "Dec 03, 2015", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/1545826-cissa", "userReview": "A brilliant, brilliant novel! (And in my opinion far better than \"Catcher in the Rye\", because Lorelei is an unreliable but likable narrator who does a fine job of navigating expectations to get what she wants in a pretty hostile world, and who is at least as self-centered as Holden but more fun.)Lorelei Lee has a very distinctive voice. Her blend of \"refined\" and ignorant is funny at first, but rather touching as one gets into her head. As is her approach to life: while she cites high ideals, she is utterly pragmatic when it comes to actions, to a point where one can only admire the choices made by \"a girl like I\".Her BFF, Dorothy- the brunette- is both more seemingly sensible and cynical, but also makes very poor life choices, especially by Lorelei's standards. Dorothy is a welcome snarky voice, though most of the snark sails right over Lorelei's head.This edition contains \"Gentlemen Prefer Blondes\" and \"But Gentlemen Marry Brunettes\", plus a LOT of interesting back-story about the history of the books and their genesis.It also has illustrations from an early edition, but unfortunately many of them are very muddy in print; I wish they had been cleaned up more.These were the inspiration for the Marilyn Monroe movie, which was itself the inspiration for the Madonna \"Material Girl\" video- in which Madonna channels Lorelei for the dance number, and Dorothy for the context.

I loved the tone of the whole thing, even the spelling mistakes. I read the little essay at the beginning of the book as well, once I had finished, and it's easy to forget that the world had never encountered anybody like Lorelei Lee before this book, at least not on the page. Despite her lack of schooling, she's very savvy and intelligent, and she knows how to use what she has to get what she wants. And her friend Dorothy is even better, though I found But Gentlemen Marry Brunettes to be not quite as scintillating. Dorothy's wisecracks got the biggest laughs out of me--like when she says, upon hearing Lorelei wax poetic about the Coty perfume shop in Place Vend\u00f4me, that Coty must have arrived, smelled Paris, and said, \"Something must be done!\" A quick, fun read with a brain, plus some scathing social commentary."}, {"userName": "Juan", "userReviewDate": "Oct 16, 2015", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/12621180-juan", "userReview": "Un par de deliciosas novelitas sobre dos muchachas del siglo pasado con poca malicia y tambi\u00e9n poca sesera.

She also didn't quite get her friend Dorothy's wit which was also quite amusing. I'd give Gentlemen Prefer Blondes: The Illuminating Diary of a Professional Lady four stars if I had read it on its own. The two ladies traveled and met rich gentlemen and had a lovely time. The book was written in such a great style that it seemed to have been written yesterday rather than in 1925. High, highly recommended for a good laugh.But Gentlemen Marry Brunettes: The Illuminating Diary of a Professional Lady was a little disappointing. It is told by Lorelei who is telling Dorothy's story. Anita Loos went a little far with the misspellings for humor in this one and I found them distracting rather than part of the story. Dorothy is funny in the book and always falls for the poor man rather than the rich one which Lorelei disapproves of.

And while I imagine Edith Wharton's calling it \"the Great American Novel\" may have been good-naturedly hyperbolic, there's no denying that it's an entertaining read, and probably has as much to say about American society in the jazz age as The Great Gatsby, if not more.Fans of the Jeeves & Wooster series may see parallels in Anita Loos's light-hearted but vicious society of upper-class hypocrisy and working-class na\u00efvet\u00e9. But where Bertie Wooster has Jeeves to get him out of trouble, Lorelei and Dorothy have only their instinctive cunning. Lorelei may not now how to spell, or anything about history, culture, or geography, but she knows what she wants and she knows how to get it. All of the men in the story, from spoiled Pennsylvania socialites to rural deputy sheriffs to even members of the Algonquin Round Table, are reduced to pawns in their story. (A story inspired by Loos noticing that a blonde could even turn an intellectual giant like H.L. Mencken to mush.)Lorelei's dimbulb narration is hilarious, but Dorothy is my favorite (and, I imagine, a stand-in for Anita Loos.) Her main purpose in Gentlemen Prefer Blondes seems to be as a sarcastic counterpoint to Lorelei's boundless enthusiasm\u2014she's not as mercenary as Lorelei and will always pass up a chance at bilking a rich bore for money when she can have a good time with a sax player or waiter.

However, as it was entirely about Dorothy who quickly became my favourite character, I thoroughly enjoyed it! Unfortunately one of the reasons I picked it up was to get a handle of what Prohibition-era New York was like, and although the Prohibition was mentioned, Dorothy and Lorelei inhabit a world where street-thugs and policemen and society and call-girls intermingle improbably.

At least, I recognised the title from the film, and with vague allusions to Edith Wharton on the back cover, promptly picked it up. In either case there is a teensy element of disappointment with the end product: Whilst generally amusing, it doesn't have the polish or archness of Dame Edith's prose, or the laugh-out-loud moments of the film, and Loos'/Lorelei's phonetic misspelling does rather jar at the start.However once you get going there's no looking back as Loos' heroines move from rich man to rich man, Ritz to Ritz, all in the name of becoming more 'educated'. And as if by magic, or more probably because Loos' has become a more consistent writer, the second half - But Gentlemen Marry Brunettes - is a much more rounded affair, with satisfying glut of flapper bitchiness liberally distributed around literary figures, the rich and between Lorelei and Dorothy."}, {"userName": "Courtney", "userReviewDate": "Dec 23, 2007", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/261209-courtney", "userReview": "The \"heroine\" is so soulless that at times this actually made me sad - the phenomenon of extreme consumerism that we feel is exclusive to the 21st century is certainly alive and well in Loo's satire of the 20s woman, who is eerily reminiscent of our current crop of Paris Hilton-etcs. Perhaps the early-20th century equivalent to Lindsay Lohan's sidekick diary - the worst womankind has to offer. While the language is certainly more refined (in the sense that it isn't fuck-this or fuck-that), the underlying desires for material items and histrionic love are certainly (and unfortunately) timeless.I loved the character of her friend Dorothy - hilarious. This is especially interesting as a counterpoint to the more realistic view of 20s high society seen in novels like \"The Great Gatsby.\""}, {"userName": "MrsCordial", "userReviewDate": "Jun 17, 2011", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/5536427-mrscordial", "userReview": "I heard about this on Open Book in early 2010 and thought I'd actually read it, as to me it falls into the category of 'famous books everyone's heard of but no-one's read'.I was really pleasantly surprised. The author's note at the beginning gives the context, and then you're launched into Lorelei's 1920s flapper social whirl. It's American but I liked it even so!Lorelei is a disingenuous gold-digging babe, an IT girl. Most of the point of the story comes out obliquely from her remarks (the book takes the form of her diary) but that's to over-intellectualise it; it's just a very funny and well-put-together story. It's short, but ideal for a train journey or a couple of nights of light reading.I'm very glad I've read it and would recommend it"}, {"userName": "Monique", "userReviewDate": "Jun 03, 2015", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/9662597-monique", "userReview": "A surprisingly hilarious read! I picked this up on a whim, and laughed the whole way through at the ridiculous, whimsical, satirical string of anecdotes told in the voice of Lorelei, complete with unique misspellings and malopropisms that made her all the more authentic (ironically!) and even a little endearing (surprisingly!). The sequel was a bit less enjoyable than the original, probably because, in my opinion, the farce went too far, and I couldn't really get lost in it. I loved Dorothy's character in the original and would have enjoyed finding out she really was as clever and savvy as she appeared to be as the \"best supporting friend.\" I have not seen the Marilyn Monroe version of this, but plan to check at my local library!"}, {"userName": "Faith Bradham", "userReviewDate": "Jan 02, 2013", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/173379-faith-bradham", "userReview": "This was a fun romp! I had no idea the movie was loosely based on this novel, but I found it in a stack of books my advisor was giving away during office hours (perks of being an English major: free books when your professors clear out their bookshelves!) and decided to give it a shot. I laughed out loud, which I don't often do for books, so I think Loos is doing something right. It's totally book candy--I ate it right up in one sitting. It's not high literature, but not everything needs to be. Plus the time period = fab. The first book is funnier and, in my opinion, better than the second one, so I'd read the second one with the first one and not on its own. Sorry for rambly review... the book is all over the place so that means I can be all over the place, right?"}], "description": "The incomparable adventures of Lorelei Lee, a little girl from Little Rock who takes the world by storm.
