For some reason, parents never seem to think this creepy old guy who was so fond of children was in any way \"disturbing,\" something I'm continually impressed with in the \"ban now, ask questions later\" climate of modern culture. If there are people who don't like Shel Silverstein, I don't want to meet them. Or, more to the point, you shouldn't meet them if that is an option. Children need to experience this kind of creepy / weird / funny / sad stuff, not just for their own sake, but for the sake of having a conduit through which they can make sense of most of the rest of the world. Knowing that Shel sees things this way, too, makes it all easier to take, and makes your own oddness that much more tolerable. We, as humans, need to come to terms with inexplicable and unfathomable in the world, and it wasn't until Shel that we began to realize that the only way to gently help our children do just that, is to let a perverted old weirdo with a large stack of Playboys in his basement lead the way."}, {"userName": "Anna M.", "userReviewDate": "Jan 09, 2016", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/28315413-anna-m", "userReview": "2016 Genre Challenge: Poetry"}, {"userName": "Janine", "userReviewDate": "Apr 06, 2007", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/51260-janine", "userReview": "The feelings I have about Shel Silverstein's A Light in the Attic and Where The Sidewalk Ends contrast so sharply with the books themselves. I loved these funny, whimsical and sometimes downright sadistic poems with all of my young heart. Even now, I feel like I'm getting away with something when I think of Clarence Lee from Tennesee who loved the commercials he saw on TV. I am still afraid for Ickle Me, Pickle Me, Tickle Me too who never returned to the world they knew. In Shel Silverstein's books I found all of my childish wishes drawn out to their natural, absurd conclusions. But I was also given a glimpse of the way that language could create beauty and inspire wonder, for we have some flax-golden tales to spin. Come in! Come in! I never guessed how a bald, bearded, barefoot man with a guitar could read my mind. It is not too much to say that I revere both works. Which is not the point of these poems at all."}, {"userName": "Emily May", "userReviewDate": "Oct 26, 2012", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/4622890-emily-may", "userReview": "\u201cDo a loony-goony dance 'Cross the kitchen floor, Put something silly in the world That ain't been there before.\u201d"}, {"userName": "Ronyell", "userReviewDate": "Jan 07, 2010", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/1169488-ronyell", "userReview": "\u201cA Light in the Attic\u201d is one of Shel Silverstein\u2019s best yet most controversial books of poems ever written. This book is full of poems about clowns, pirates, monsters and all manner of strange people and animals doing crazy things. \u201cA Light in the Attic\u201d may be too suggestive and morbid for smaller children, but older children will easily delight themselves with the silly shenanigans of the characters. Shel Silverstein\u2019s writing is as witty as it is funny as he writes each character\u2019s stories in a poetic prose. One of the funniest poems I have read was \u201cSquishy Touch\u201d when the main character turns everything into Jell-O. Shel Silverstein\u2019s illustrations are highly creative as the images make the characters look scratchy and also I love the images being presented in black and white colors, a technique that is usually used for long books. The image that probably stood out the most was the image of the Gink as it has a large mouth with sharp teeth and the image of the kids coming out of the Gink on the next page. Parents should know that there are some suggestive and morbid content in this book that young children might not understand. One poem that might be too suggestive for children would be the poem \u201cHow not to have to dry the dishes\u201d as it entices children to break the dishes in order not to dry them. Another poem that might be too morbid for children would be \u201cLittle Abigail and the Beautiful Pony\u201d as it deals with the death of a child and parents might want to explain to their children about the concept of death before they read this poem. \u201cA Light in the Attic\u201d is an excellent book about silly poems about silly people who do crazy stunts and it will surely be an instant for many children young and old. I would recommend this book to children ages six and up since smaller children might be a bit disturbed by the suggestive and morbid content displayed in this book.

I think when I first read it I must have been about eight or nine years old, because I remember reading it myself, and loving it. (I must have checked it out of the library about a million times.) What's not to love? Shel gives us such gems as:BEAR IN THEREThere's a Polar BearIn our Frigidaire--He likes it 'cause it's cold in there.With his seat in the meatAnd his face in the fishAnd his big hairy pawsIn the buttery dish,He's nibbling the noodles,He's munching the rice,He's slurping the soda,He's licking the ice.And he lets out a roarIf you open the door.And it gives me a scareTo know he's in there--That Polary BearIn our Fridgitydaire.andHOT DOGI have a hot dog for a pet,The only kind my folds would let Me get.He does smell sort of badAnd yet,He absolutely never getsThe sofa wet.We have a butcher for a vet,The strangest vet you ever met.Guess we're the weirdest family yet,To have a hot dog for a pet.Of course, she loves almost all of the poems. And I'd forgotten that the wonderful illustrations were also by Silverstein. One word of caution for parents reading to younger kids: some of the poems do deal (albeit in a silly way) with issues such as drowning (in your own tears), getting kidnapped (by a Wild Barbazzoop), and Ticklish Tom (who unfortunately giggles his way onto a railroad track). Small matters, surely, but good to know when you're reading something to your child that's slightly over their head in terms of age-appropriateness. It's nice to be prepared for the moment just after you've finished reading, and your little one turns to you and says, \"Mommy, what's kidnapping?\""}, {"userName": "Gauri", "userReviewDate": "Dec 16, 2016", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/3760321-gauri", "userReview": "I read a little bit from this book everyday to my younger brother this past week. I can't remember if I finished this myself in my own childhood, but it felt like I read it for the first time, so I'll put this in the list of books I read this year.

Long after losing my appetite for R.L. Stine's \"Fear Street\" or the frightful suspense of Alvin Schwartz' \"Scary Stories to Tell in the Dark\", Silverstein's whimsical passages continue to invoke nostalgic and thoughtful reflection. Of \"The Giving Tree\", my mother echoes the undeviating refrain that it is a woeful fable of an ungrateful child and a loving, long suffering parent. I respond with a nod of agreement and apology having learned better than to quarrel with her interpretation of that particular work.\"I've discovered a way to stay friends forever--There's really nothing to it.I simply tell you what to doAnd you do it!\" ~ FriendshipHis deeply imaginative ideas combined with a rich awareness of words to craft a collection of clever cerebral exchanges. Silverstein chose not to endeavour making sense of the utter nonsense which exists in the dreams of children. In his poems and illustrations, there resides an inquisitive surreality of characters and circumstances which are at times morbid, silly, unusual, somber, capricious, self indulgent or inappropriate. That array of attributes represented a wider spectrum than most children's literature of his era had considered yet all were qualities of which any child might be possessed.\"I shot an arrow toward the sky,It hit a white cloud floating by.The cloud fell dying to the shore,I don't shoot arrows anymore.\" ~ ArrowsIn spite of resolute parental naivete on our part, children are not yet whole beings. They are evolving and developing with each new insight which should arise. Why should they not be given the full palette of human emotion in which to dabble their paintbrush while there remains a steady hand to guide their intentions? Silverstein recognized children were smarter than adults acknowledged and wrote images filled with riddles, trap doors and passageways into the unknown.If confusion arose as to the meaning of any given story, there was no discernible moral interpretation at the end. He trusted that children could ask questions and sort out those quandaries on their own. What if they could send away in the mail for a new set of parents as does the young man in \"Clarence\"? Is it such a terrifying thought that every child might at some moment dislike their parents? Or desire to join the UCR (Union for Children's Rights) and dispense with performing chores until their demands are met?\"Now I lay me down to sleep,I pray the Lord my soul to keep,And if I die before I wake,I pray the Lord my toys to break,So none of the other kids can use them...Amen.\" ~ Prayer of the Selfish ChildSilverstein wrote in the tradition of the grand triumvirate alongside Seuss and Sendak. Authors of juvenile literature who were unafraid to stretch and layer their passages into the space of fascination and fantasy. Could those arcane worlds engaged in Harry Potter or \"The Hunger Games\" exist without the precedent laid by the dragon of Grindly Grun, the Gooloo bird or the quick digesting Gink?Silverstein can be an especially difficult read when one has spent a lifetime having their language skills battered into shape by each gruesome guardian of the English oral tradition. His random meter and loose leaning prose lead one to imagine they are reading another language entirely. I surely realize now that he inspires the same wonder and bewilderment as deciphering Pablo Neruda in Spanish. Perhaps this is the greatest gift Silverstein leaves behind in these writings. A self contained language filled with a meaning and clarity all its own which will be accessed only when you rediscover the precocious, curiosity you brought to the book as a child exploring literature for the first time."}, {"userName": "Amber Adams", "userReviewDate": "Apr 22, 2013", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/13140108-amber-adams", "userReview": "One picture puzzle pieceLyin\u2019 on the sidewalk,One picture puzzle pieceSoakin\u2019 in the rain.It might be a button of blueOn the coat of the womanWho lived in a shoe.It might be a magical bean,Or a fold in the redVelvet robe of a queen.It might be the one little biteOf the apple her stepmotherGave to Snow White.It might be the veil of a brideOr a bottle with some evil genie inside.It might be a small tuft of hairOn the big bouncy bellyOf Bobo the Bear.It might be a bit of the cloakOf the Witch of the WestAs she melted to smoke.It might be a shadowy traceOf a tear that runs down an angel\u2019s face.Nothing has more possibilitiesThan one old wet picture puzzle piece.~Shel SilversteinIn this poem, Shel Silverstein used very descriptive language when describing the puzzle piece. He extends his sentences to give the story more details. He begins to make the story person when he mentioned specific names that are familiar to his readers. (Snow White, witch of the west and Bobo Bear) He uses allusions to draw the readers in and allows them to form a personal connection with the poem.I believe the author did a great job using the elements of writers craft. His words paint detailed pictures in the readers'. When he described the possibilities of the puzzle piece, he describes each detail of the puzzle in that stage. While reading I noticed that Silverstein is using a specific \"country\" dialect to tell the poem. I love how Silverstein uses the country tone to tell the poem. He also incorporates the popular characters to pull the readers in. Silverstein must \u201cstudy through research\u201d (pg. 109, Ray) to draw readers into the poem. It seems like Silverstein had to do some research in order to create an authentic poem.I would use this book in my classroom to teach students how to write descriptive poems or stories. the author uses so much needed details in this poem. I would introduce the poem with the descriptive words and later with out the descriptive words to show the students how important the descriptive words are. I will also teach my student show to include allusions in their writing."}, {"userName": "Carrie", "userReviewDate": "Mar 15, 2008", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/721877-carrie", "userReview": "I used this book for a talent show in Jr High.
