Come to it with a clear mind. Yes, it is full of difficult names and different tribes. Leaders of both sides come and go, all realistic characters that tell stories of a far-away time but carry a message that never becomes old. The desire of everyone of us to be free, free in every way, regardless of religion, ethnicity, financial status etc. Yes, we all live together sharing our Earth but this doesn't mean that the few can dictate a way of life to be shared by all, to obey blindly. Where is the freedom of choice we all desire? Is it a given? Far from it, I'd say. In our days, we see enemies of a different kind of oppression, enemies that are invisible, enemies that do not brandish swords, but money, surpluses and modern machine guns.When you read the final page of a 700+ book and you find that there wasn't a single ''filler'' moment, you experience something rare, especially for a lover of Historical fiction, a genre notorious for its ''fillers'''. There are numerous books about Boudica's rebellion against the army of Rome. the best example is the tetralogy of Boudica by Manda Scott. (If you haven't read it, you must!) It is the first book, though, that Caradoc takes a part of the spotlight. My knowledge of him was limited to the Celtic class in univeristy. Here, the narration is divided between his attempts to free a nation and Boudica's struggle to find the balance between the wishes of her cowardish husbad and her fiery nature that longs for a free Albion.\n\"Such a little word, freedom, such a small request, and yet the asking of it has consumed the soul of a people.\"\nThe fight seems doomed from the start, the conclusion is well-known. Still, the author has created a book that takes you in an exciting, mystical journey. Each character has something to offer. Caradoc, his illusions, Eurgain, her fierce devotion, Gladys, her love, Aricia carries the wounds of the past like markings from a hot iron, causing havoc, bringing dishonour. She was my favourite character in all her controversial nature. I found Caradoc a bit naive, and watching Boudica trying to put up with Prasutagus' notions of a Roman peace was painful. He should have known that the lion would not lie down with the lamb.There is a sentence that struck me the moment I read it. \n''Far away, in the swirling autumn mists of Albion, the light of freedom flickered and went out.''\n Thank God that the statue of Boudica and her daughters in London by Thomas Thornycroft, facing Big Ben, stands as a witness to the candle of freedom that is put out far too many times and, yet, is always lit again..."}, {"userName": "Kate Quinn", "userReviewDate": "May 12, 2009", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/2232084-kate-quinn", "userReview": "I normally avoid historicals if they contain the words \"sweeping\" or \"three generations\" - but this book deserves both without irony. It tells the story of the Roman invasion of Britain, first opposed by the less well-known Caradoc whose guerilla tactics might have been successful if he'd had better luck, and followed by the revolt of the better-known Boudicca. The characters are complex and moving, the battle scenes wrenching, and the history meticulous. Caradoc is a moving hero, a man determined to burn himself inside and out if it will save his people, and Boudicca is majestic and tragic as the vengeful mother to both her own wronged children and her wronged people. Perhaps most remarkable, the Britain depicted here has magic and mystery without resorting to the cheap Mother Goddess mysticism of authors who prefer their history to come with New Age labels. A desperate, tragic, absorbing read. You will hate Rome with all your heart by the end, and only then realize that the Rome who wronged Caradoc and Boudicca is long gone."}, {"userName": "Carlo", "userReviewDate": "Sep 19, 2010", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/4306852-carlo", "userReview": "One of my managers at the bookstore recommended this book to me, I had no idea who Pauline Gedge was and when I did my research I just found a mediocre wikipedia entry; normally I wouldn't go for a complete unknown author but a book about Celtic Historical Fiction is sort of hard to disregard.Well, to my delight the Eagle and the Raven turned out to be extraordinary, Pauline Gedge may not be a certified historian but she's got her facts straight. Moreover, the way she writes this book is so incredibly smooth, the story is fast-paced and her narration is very precise, which normally doesn't leave room for that poetic tone that softens tragic events, battles or dramatic situations; however, Pauline pulls it off with style and there's always that feeling that the lines just glide in front of your eyes, as if every single word was carefully chosen to add a colorful mood to the narrative.Fun read, plus the historical value is enormous, I had somewhat of an idea about what was going on in Britain before the Romans came crashing in, but this book added a lot to it."}, {"userName": "Jane", "userReviewDate": "Nov 08, 2012", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/7177008-jane", "userReview": "The theme of the book was freedom of the Britons, in the face of Roman invasion and occupation of Britain. I liked that the Roman invasion of Britain was presented from the British tribes' points of view for a change. I saw how they possibly would have interacted, got a feel for some of their culture and sympathized completely with them. After many years, Caradoc asks Plautius--the two have become friends: \"How would you feel if this country [Rome] lay under the rule of the tribes who had taken everything, even your values, from you and then told you that you ought to be grateful?\" Boudicca was an important character, but the noble Caradoc was really the hero. The blurb and cover were misleading. The book did climax in her rebellion and eventual death, though, along with the devastating revenge of the Romans.Someone mentioned the seduction scene near the beginning. Although it was jarring, I felt it served a purpose: to show at the outset the selfishness, vanity and evil in Aricia/Cartamandua and the guilelessness of the young Caradoc. She later betrays Caradoc/Caractacus into Roman hands. Much later on, she tries to seduce a Roman general, a legate. She hasn't changed; she's just as venal.While still reading, I felt any love interest between Briton and Roman to be completely over-the-top literary license. However, subsequently I read elsewhere of a legend [or tradition] that Caradoc's sister married the Roman commander, Aulus Plautius, and Caradoc's daughter married a senator--or centurion in another version of the legend. According to the legend, the senator, Rufus Pudens, and two of Caradoc's children, the brother and sister Llyn/Linus and Gladys/Claudia became Christians and Pudens was martyred. The Pudens, Linus, and Claudia mentioned in the New Testament may refer to them. In the novel they are all non-Christians, however.  The Roman poet Martial did write of his \"friend Pudens\" marrying \"Claudia the Foreigner\" [Epigrams IV:13] or the \"blue-eyed Briton\" [Epigrams XI:53]. These are interesting speculations on any possible truth of the legend..."}, {"userName": "Alicja", "userReviewDate": "Oct 21, 2013", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/4745220-alicja", "userReview": "[Suicide? Really? Fuck that! Boudicca should have faced the victorious Romans on the battlefield and died with a sword in her hand slaying them until the end. I hated that ending of her, hated. And with this ending comes another double standard of how the author treats differently her male and female characters. The male characters have made a point of dying in an honorable way. There was even talk at the beginning regarding Caradoc's father and how suicide would not be an honorable way to die. I think that was a slap in the face at the end to have Boudicca die that way. The more I think about this book, the more I see that regardless of its emphasis on strong sword-women among the tribes, it's not a feminist work. I couldn't even count how many times mannish (for an author who can describe a rock with two-long winded paragraphs, she really couldn't find better words?) was used to describe Boudicca.

The Eagle and the Raven is a magnificent book. Well written, and well researched. There is nothing about this book that is lacking. It starts in the Autumn of A.D. 32 with a young Caradoc, the future leader of the Celtic revolt against the tyranny of Rome and continues through Autumn A.D. 59; to the fall of Boudicca. I write this review with tears in my eyes, tears of pride at being of Celtic decent, and with tears of sadness that the freedom of the Celtic people has yet to come to fruition. Still caught up in the throws of, what I consider, to be the last remnants of Rome. Whether you are from Celtic decent or not, should you read this book, you will appreciate the struggle of a people who were far from barbaric; who were artists, poets, and craftsmen and whose only longing was to be free. Pauline Gedge has written a book that is filled with historical accuracy, though written as historical fiction. It is a book that gives an account of the struggle of the Celtic people and their quest to retain their culture amidst Romes efforts to neutralize and control it; to break the will of the people, to conquer them, and to force absolute submission. This is the story of their resistance. The resistance of a people simply trying to be free. A story familiar to all peoples who have resisted tyranny and still do to this day. A story of the primal will to be free.... and remain free."}, {"userName": "Lisa", "userReviewDate": "Mar 11, 2012", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/1860691-lisa", "userReview": "What an amazing, amazing book.

In some ways, I didn't feel like the scope was large enough \u2013 I wanted to see Aricia get her comeuppance, and to see what happened to Venutius.

I completely immersed myself in the way Gedge developed Caradoc from carefree teenage boy to arviragus. I could feel the anguish pouring from Caradoc as he fought to unite the various tribes against Rome. Gedge did a fantastic job making me feel like I was involved in the relationship between Caradoc and his wife Eugrain. Gedge was able to make me see how dependent Caradoc was on Eugrain and how deeply he truly did love her without resorting to any kind of explicit sex scenes. I was completely engrossed in Caradoc's quest to free Albion from Rome. Gedge wrote her characters in such a manner that I couldn't help but cry when people such as Togodumnus and Cinnamus died. I found myself so involved in the lives of these characters that I had a hard time tearing myself away from the book. Then Caradoc is captured and his family is taken to Rome. Emperor Claudius sets up Caradoc and his family within Rome instead of executing them. As soon as Caradoc and his family settled in Rome, I felt like I hit a brick wall. As far as I am concerned, Gedge could have moved Caradoc and his family to Rome and never spoke of them again. Had Gedge done this, she could have gone back to Boudicca's store. By the time I got through Rome and back to Albion, I was craving some of what hooked me in the first place.

My heart is in complete shambles.Full Review:How do you write a review for a book like this - that takes you to this magical world (I say \"magical\" even though this world 100% exists because the way Gedge writes Albion is so beautiful, so majestic, so ethereal, that words cease to accurately express the wonderment you have when you read this book and get transported here), into these incredibly crafted people and then slowly breaks your heart as you read the tragedy of the Roman Occupation of England?Probably 95% of the book is the precursor to the more famous story of Boudicca and how she very nearly was able to oust the Romans from Albion. We start out the book with Caradoc (the real life person of Caractus), Togodumnus, Aricia (known as Cartimandua) and Eurgain in their early/late teens. The world of Albion is relatively peaceful - Caradoc's father is looking to extend the borders of Catuvellauni tribe, Aricia faces going home to Brigantia, Caradoc battles his emotions towards Aricia and Eurgain. And then...Rome attacks.This book took me nearly 4 months to read, but it wasn't because i was bored or dragging myself through it because I hated it. Hilariously enough, I struggled with the sheer size of this book - it is bigger than your typical paperbacks, more like a hardcover size with pages full of text from top to bottom on its 694 page length. So the book was heavy and awkward - in the gym, in the bath, before bedtime, on the plane. Nonetheless, I prevailed!One thing I discussed multiple times with my buddy, Iset, when reading this was how stunned I was at the page count. You know how there are books where you read 300 pages and you are in awe because not a whole lot of anything actually happened. Trying to remember what actually happened and what the point was is a complete mystery. This book was a different experience - I was stunned at how much happened in these pages, how much I grew to love these characters, from Caradoc and Aricia to the Romans, Plautius and Rufus, and how I was enraptured with the story. Every page, every dialogue, every chapter had a point - either driving character development (and damn, this book does NOT shy on the tough character development!!) or plot or painting a beautiful picture of this ancient world.Honestly, I could go on and on about this book and never really write a review that does this book justice. There are so many aspects where my comments amount to - this was awesome! I love this! This was great! It feels repetitive and phoned in after awhile, and yet that's exactly my thoughts when reading this book. This book nearly literally sent me back in time. I would come out of the book and have to reorient myself. And then you have the ending that kept me up way past my bedtime and sent my heart and soul into overdrive. (The last two paragraphs may not seem like much if you hadn't invested in the whole book, but when I read those at nearly 1am this morning, I was in near tears, my heart pounding and aching as I tried to go to sleep.)Before I end this horrible review of a wonderful book, I must talk a little about this magical, mystical world of Albion. Albion is (obviously) England, but when reading this book, it's so much more than that. Iset and I went back and forth, trying to describe in words what you felt in your soul - how achingly beautiful the forests were, how mystical and magical it was, as if it was a real life Lothlorien (no wonder Tolkien wrote Middle Earth the way he did!!!!), how REAL the setting was in every location, from Siluria to Brigantia to Camulodunum. I've had the pleasure of going to England, nearly 3 years ago, and even without reading this book, I was stunned at how old and yet magical it was - and now that I've finished \"The Eagle and the Raven\", I very much want to go back and soak in the Roman Baths and absorb the beauty of this amazing land - and yet also mourn the men and women who died in the name of freedom.I've had some bad luck with books in the last few years, reading lackluster and mediocre books. This book is definitely not one of them.Thank you, Iset, for sharing this lovely read with me!"}, {"userName": "Laurentiu Lazar", "userReviewDate": "Aug 21, 2012", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/4736649-laurentiu-lazar", "userReview": "[Rome came first with traders, slowly taming the minds of many. Cunobelin was chief of the Catuvellauni, the mightiest of the low-land tribes. Cattle raiding, hunting and preserving the already owned land were his goals \u2013 the strengthening of borders after years of war. Caradoc, Tog, Aricia, Gladys, Eugrain, Adminius the childhood band, raised together each with an unscrupulous fate. Aricia is called back to Brigantia to take over the throne \u2013 she marries Venutius, a powerful Brigantian chief, out of interest; Eugraine marries Caradoc; Adminius betrays them for Rome\u2019s ideals; Gladys preserves her wildness; Tog and Caradoc share the burden and become ricons. New expansion plans, fighting for new conquests \u2013 expanding the Catuvellauni\u2019s hold upon the Albion. Finally, Rome decides its course of action, invasion. The legions invade and give battle to the low-lands of Britannia, defeating the gathering of tribes led by Tog and Caradoc. Defeat. Tog\u2019s death, followed by Gladys\u2019s capture and flight into the West for the rest of the family. The druids give the western chieftains food for thought, presenting Caradoc as the chosen one, the defender of the Albion. The charismatic, shrewd, witty, silver-tongued hero of ours convinces the Silurians, Ordovices and the rest of the pristine tribes to proclaim him as Arvigarius. Meanwhile, Gladys embarks for Rome, happily married with the former invasion general Plautius. Years of subterfuge tactics end up with the sudden defeat in a face to face battle against the legions \u2013 the na\u00efve blindness of the barbarian warrior. Caradoc escapes to Brigantia, the land of Aricia, the Roman puppet, who captures and expedites him to Colchester, and from there along with his family toward the capital. Fate smiles upon them, escaping death, being exiled for life in Rome. There, the process of Romanization meets its course, despite the fact that their souls forever run homeward and struggle to be free. In the meantime, Bouddica and the tribes had their own battles to fight. A sudden death of the governor, and a flight of shame for Venutius from the enticing charms of his wife Aricia, leads to his junction with the free tribes, followed by the total annihilation of a legion. Venutius is proclaimed Arvigarus, but unfortunately his mind and heart are still diseased, both betray him by making ruinous decisions one after another \u2013 the attack of Brigantia and the engage in open battle of Rome\u2019s \u201cfighting machine\u201d ends direfully. Bouddica\u2019s love for Prasutagus, kept her on short leash so far, while years of prosperity passed by and made the Iceni tribe the most prosperous and trustful ally of Rome. Fate struck, her beloved dies and a corrupt procurer avenges his thirst and hate of barbarians against the Iceni folk, rapping the two princesses and flogging Bouddica in the process. What followed was the famous rebellion, where the 9th legion was almost whipped out, several Roman settlements being razed to the ground and almost brought them the freedom so much desired. \n(hide spoiler)]"}, {"userName": "Iset", "userReviewDate": "Mar 03, 2011", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/4973578-iset", "userReview": "[Raising the first rebellion against the Roman invaders, I might well call him the Vercingetorix of Britain, uniting disparate warring tribes under his military leadership to resist the might of Rome.

The characters are complex and well drawn, and ancient Britain under the Romans is very well described. Without turning the Romans into evil caricatures, Gedge does a brilliant job of motivating the urge for rebellion. Personal relationships, even of some of the relatively minor characters, are completely believable and very moving. She also handles the magical beliefs of the Britons very well. You can get into their skin and see it as they see it, without the author injecting real magic into the story.Two things to bear in mind if you consider reading this book, so that you won\u2019t be disappointed. One is that \u2014 despite the description on the cover of my edition \u2014 most of the book is not focused on Boudicca. It is about ancient Britain more generally, with other tribal leaders (first Caradoc and then Venutius) occupying most of the book. The second is that the book is long. (My edition has 744 pages of small type and it took me two months to read!) It isn\u2019t too long \u2014 there are no extraneous scenes or plot lines \u2014 but I do recommend reading it when you know you\u2019ll be able to dedicate the time to enjoy it fully. It\u2019s also dense, with many characters and lots of detail, so it\u2019s best read in long sections, rather than in little snippets.I checked what is known about the history and it seems that, at least in broad strokes, the book is historically accurate. My only criticism of the book is that I wish that my edition had had a map of ancient Britain. Obviously these can be found on the internet, but it would have been nice just to flip to a map in the book to see where the different places mentioned were in relation to one another."}, {"userName": "mixal", "userReviewDate": "Sep 10, 2013", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/13759311-mixal", "userReview": "Got through 15% of this book and I am giving up. It is the worst HF book I have read in a long time. This book is very long and the 15% is like one third of a book of average length. Yet I do not feel any closer to the culture or to any of the characters. The book is about some jumble of relationship of some indistinct characters, but the actual details about the culture that I would be interested in are missing. It has a feel of some theatre play, whose plot could be set into just any era, it is not very historically specific. Also, I find the whole importance of freedom for some of the characters very anachronistic, the same way as in the Braveheart movie. I can understand it in characters that live under some oppression, threat of slavery, but in warriors and chieftons? They are always under the command of their kings, no? Mind you, the setting is before Roman invasion. It seems to me that the author wants to project some romantic modern national sentiments into the characters but I do not buy it. And that's just one of the things... Overall one star from me, but anyone who reads this review should mind that this rating is based only on the first 15% of the book. The book might improve later on but I am not interested enough to find out."}, {"userName": "Veronica", "userReviewDate": "Dec 14, 2013", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/2153853-veronica", "userReview": "A long-out-of-print book picked up in 2004 via Abebooks. It has a lurid Celtic-style cover and the jacket copy raves on about Boudicca: \"Warrior Queen ... She defied the brutal might and seductive corruption of Imperial Rome ... She was the flame-haired Boudicca, Queen of the Britons\" etc. etc. Actually the book is not about Boudicca at all -- she only plays a really significant role in the last hundred pages or so. The story starts in AD 32, just before the Romans' second invasion of Britain, and ends with Boudicca's defeat in AD 60. Most of the first part tells the story of Caratacus and Cartimandua (a pity Gedge didn't include any historical notes on sources, as they are here called Caradoc and Aricia, and I got halfway through the book before I realised who they were). Presumably Americans are considerably more likely to have heard of Boudicca than Caratacus.It's a long book, 744 pages of tiny type and narrow margins, with enough material for at least three novels. At first I found the style rather overdone, almost Victorian, and wasn't really engaged by the characters, but gradually it grew on me. Gedge builds up a compelling, atmospheric picture of a superstitious society where evil spirits really do dwell in the forests and life is brutish and short for most people. No noble savages here, many of them are dishonest, unreliable, and downright murderous when crossed. The atmosphere is choking and claustrophobic as a few Britons struggle to beat the invading Romans back from their shores. There are rather too many characters who play a major role for a while and then slip out of view, but Gedge does a good job of drawing out the contrast between the fates of Caradoc and Boudicca. Caradoc, after his fierce resistance to Roman conquest, is tamely handed over by Cartimandua, and dragged off to Rome, where the Emperor Claudius promptly pardons him and forces him to live -- rather implausibly given his previous character -- in humiliating bourgeois comfort, while Boudicca, alone in the forest, falls on her sword after her defeat by Suetonius.American reviewers are wildly enthusiastic about it, I suspect because of the undertones of the American war of independence against British imperialism. Worth re-reading at any rate."}, {"userName": "Carrie Slager", "userReviewDate": "Feb 14, 2014", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/8854256-carrie-slager", "userReview": "When I read this book I was, of course, expecting it to be about Boudicca. The blurb and the cover made me expect it to be an epic saga about the warrior queen who led the doomed rebellion against Rome. Yet out of the 892 pages of my edition of The Eagle and the Raven, I would say that less than 200 of them are actually about Boudicca. Most of the novel is about Caradoc (usually called Caratacus), the man who led a failed rebellion before she did. Boudicca\u2019s actual rebellion doesn\u2019t start until the last 100 pages, which requires some creative pace-changing on Pauline Gedge\u2019s part to get through all of the rebellion in such a short amount of page space.I truly would not recommend this novel. It\u2019s one of Gedge\u2019s early novels, but it does not match the quality of Child of the Morning at all. She does not do as well with ancient Britain as she does with ancient Egypt, so I can certainly see why she returned to ancient Egypt after she finished this novel. The Eagle and the Raven is long and meandering, without any hint of the tension that is present in all of her other novels. I truly had to struggle to finish this novel, something that I don\u2019t do often, no matter how boring the novel is.The main characters in The Eagle and the Raven are very well-developed. Caradoc is believable and grows through the novel and despite her brief appearance, Boudicca develops in an incredibly short amount of time. However, secondary characters are somewhat neglected, especially Aricia, who had the potential to be a really amazing villain but ended up coming off as your clich\u00e9 evil seductress. Venutius just came across as an idiotic, brow-beaten man, but there were obvious attempts to give him depth, which failed spectacularly in my eyes.My overall impression? I\u2019m sticking to Pauline Gedge\u2019s Egyptian novels.I give this book 1.5/5 stars."}, {"userName": "Aitziber Conesa Madinabeitia", "userReviewDate": "Nov 19, 2015", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/5893865-aitziber-conesa-madinabeitia", "userReview": "Me ha gustado, pero con peque\u00f1as pegas.

La verdad es que lo tiene todo para molar: romanos y britanos en guerra. Y es que \u00c1guilas y Cuervos se centra en la guerra de conquista por Britania por parte de los romanos en los tiempos del emperador Claudio, en un momento en el que las Galias ya eran una posesi\u00f3n romana y las fronteras continentales estaban perfectamente definidas en el eje Rin-Danubio. \u00c1guilas y Cuervos comienza cont\u00e1ndonos la historia de Caradoc y Togodumno, los hijos del rey de los catuvelaunos, Cimbelino, un rey belicoso y manipulador, amigo de los romanos con los que mantiene un comercio fluido desde su capital de Camulodunom, arrebatada a sus enemigos, los trinobantes.

Let me start off with one problem that a lot of people have with the book, which is really unfair.I rate the book 5 stars but the book jacket (the one I have anyway) -5 stars. The cover picture looks like you are reading a romance novel, but that's not the worse part. The blurb on the back have some vague thing about Boudicca. People going into this book think it is about her, when it's not. She is a minor character until about the last hundred pages.The first half of the book is pretty much about Caradoc. The second half is divided into four stories, Caradoc in Rome, the western tribes, Arica and Boudicca. The story is about the events of the Roman conquest of Albion(England), not Boudicca.With that out of the way, the other more valid complaint I have about the story is I feel that it felt unfinished. That might sound crazy considering the book is 900 pages long. The four stories in the second half of the book felt like they just stopped, with no closure really except for Boudicca's. The first half of the book felt like that could be the end, there was closure.Besides that, it's a great read.

However, plot-wise it sagged: the vast majority of the book is about Caradoc (Caratacus) and his unsuccessful rebellion against Rome. Upon his defeat, though, it both follows him to Rome and picks up the thread of various other British rebellions, culminating with Boudicca's. The tone of the book is very mythic (it is extremely Arthurian) and the adventures of the family in Rome don't really suit that - history comes up against mythic and it ends up feeling less plausible in ways that are kind of annoying. They are - as Caradoc admits - fleas against the elephant of Rome, so why are they suddenly So Very Important in Rome just as they were in Britain? The Rome episodes take away from the impact of what we learn about Britain; Caradoc and his family are not relevant to Boudicca's rebellion at all. Additionally I couldn't quite get a handle on Gedge's treatment of her female characters. On the one hand the women are warriors alongside the men and there are many strong, powerful female characters; but on the other hand, the storylines for the women revolve almost entirely around romance. So Eurgain is presented mostly as Caradoc's wife and most of our involvement with her comes via her relationship with Caradoc; Aricia is a stereotypical lust-crazed villainess (which is actually uncomfortable when one looks at the actual plot: aged fourteen, she sleeps with Caradoc, who is older, and begs him to marry her, but he says \"nope\" and sends her away from the only family she's ever known; yet she is the evil brazen seductress and he hapless against her wiles, as are many other men to come); Gladys doesn't really get her own plot until she begins her love story; even Boudicca, until the death of her husband, is presented mostly in the context of her (strong and loving) marriage and partnership. Furthermore, after Boudicca's daughters are raped, they both go instantly insane; Boudicca herself indicates that it is nearly impossible for her to figure out a way/reason to go on living after her husband's death. All that said, this book was incredibly absorbing and, had I read it as a teenager, I doubtless would have become obsessed with it; so four stars."}, {"userName": "Kristen", "userReviewDate": "Aug 01, 2017", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/933315-kristen", "userReview": "What were they thinking? The editor, designer, and/or marketing assistant who came up with the description and cover of this book. No, it isn't really the story of Boudicca. Rather, it's an all-encompassing telling of the multifaceted, piecemeal, battle-by-battle, treaty-by-treaty diminishment, erosion, and eventual elimination of Albion--the multi-tribe-dominated island we now call Britain. Once I stopped waiting for Boudicca to show up, I was able to slow down and really appreciate the many threads that Gedge is weaving together here. The character of Caradoc is a compelling through-line, with his story being the central one; his trials and fate reflect those of Albion itself. But by devoting plenty of space to other characters such as Caradoc's wife Eurgain, his lover/enemy Aricia, his sister Gladys, the Roman general Paulinus, and yes, Boudicca and family, Gedge does a lovely job of offering us a view of an entire culture (well, at least the upper-class movers and shakers of that culture) at a time of massive upheaval and change. This book also emphasizes how gradual the destruction of a people can be: here, it comes about through a process of negotiation, deals, skirmishes, promises, broken promises, more battles, and more battles. Rome didn't show up and take over Britain. Over the course of decades, various peoples had various interactions with the Roman interlopers, eventually ending with the complete subjugation of all of those peoples. So, if you are interested in this era, this is a wonderfully immersive journey.
