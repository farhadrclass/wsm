That\u2019s how this series left me. I\u2019m still not really sure what to make of it. Don\u2019t get me wrong\u2014the ultimate impression is a positive one. But, not unlike clich\u00e9d and stupid Facebook statuses, it\u2019s complicated. The Magicians left me depressed and flummoxed, but intrigued. It was the other side of the Harry Potter/Charlie Bucket coin\u2014kid gets golden ticket, only golden ticket turns out to royally screw up one\u2019s psyche. It was the Watchmen spin on the tried-and-true fantasy formula\u2014let\u2019s think about what would REALLY happen if some kid woke up one day, discovered he had magical powers, and got into a school with other hormonal and maladjusted teens in the same situation. It was messy. It was ugly. But it was brilliantly executed.I expected The Magician King to continue in that vein\u2026instead, it presented a pretty paint-by-numbers fantasy tale, filled with heroic feats of derring-do, albeit with cynical hipster commentary. It was much more comfortable to read\u2014like slipping on an old pair of sweatpants after wearing too-tight fancy-pants designer jeans all day (ummm\u2026or so I\u2019ve heard, having no direct experience myself with such tomfoolery\u2026ahem). I enjoyed it more than I did The Magicians, but if reading The Magicians was like eating some weird gourmet spiced cinnamon chocolate cardamom kale monkey essence designer gelato (perplexing and memorable and tasty but kind of off-putting), then reading The Magician King was like eating vanilla ice cream with chocolate syrup\u2014delicious, but immediately forgotten because you\u2019ve had it many times before and can easily get it again.So, what did The Magician's Land taste like? For most of the book\u2026cucumbers\u2014that is, not unpleasant, but kind of bland and unremarkable. A nice texture to add to a salad, sure, but certainly not something that you\u2019re going to seek out and crave. The whole Quentin/Plum/suitcase caper seemed like it should have been raucous good times; but, it just felt flat. After the epic build-up of the first two books, watching Quentin putter around Brakebills, deal with his father\u2019s death, and get mixed up in some asshatted talking bird shenanigannery felt anticlimactic. Even Quentin\u2019s showdown with maniacal Smurfette (aka Niffin Alice) felt kind of meh. The best parts of the story took place in Fillory\u2014Eliot and Janet saved the first 75% of the book, and Janet may have emerged as the most compelling character in the series for me. The way things were going, it was headed toward a 3-star rating. Why, then, does this book get 4 stars? Two reasons: 1) The Peter Jackson/LoTR Corollary: When you get to the end of a trilogy, and parts of the trilogy have been brilliant, and the overall body of work is impressive, you give the concluding volume a little extra bump to recognize all of that (in this case, let\u2019s call it a half star\u2026in the case of RoTK, that was 5 stars all the way, but that\u2019s neither here nor there; if you want more on my feelings about RoTK, I\u2019ve already babbled on at length about it).2) The Ending. I\u2019m a complete and total sucker for a happy ending in which characters are redeemed or validated. Gets me every f-ing time. I mean, I\u2019m not so bad as to get all misty-eyed when Rob Schneider gets his act together in Deuce Bigalow: Male Gigolo (and yes, I\u2019ve actually seen that happen to someone), but I\u2019m pretty bad. So even though Quentin had his ups-and-downs, even though he was kind of a sad sack, even if he never quite rose to the level of being what his potential suggested he might become, he stepped up for one (albeit time-lapsed millennium-long) brief moment and saved the day before humbly giving up power and stepping aside, George Washington-style (I\u2019m a sucker for that, too). And that\u2019s worth a half star in my book (or, in this case, in Mr. Grossman\u2019s book).Hence, 4 stars. All in all, a series well worth reading."}, {"userName": "Dan Schwent", "userReviewDate": "May 09, 2013", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/870755-dan-schwent", "userReview": "In the wake of being cast out of Fillory and a short stint as a teacher at Brakebills, Quentin finds himself recruited to be part of a heist to steal a mysterious briefcase for a talking blackbird. Meanwhile, Eliot and Janet find that the magic sustaining Fillory is failing and its up to them to stop it...I got this from Netgalley.Well, Goodreads ate the review I spent 20 minutes writing so you're all getting shorter, probably angrier, version. There will be spoilers.The Magicians series by Lev Grossman has had a special place in my heart for a few years now. The review I wrote for the first book was the one that put me on the map as a reviewer as far as I was concerned, the first one that got more than a fistful of votes. When I got approved for it on Netgalley, I pushed everything aside like vegetables at Chris Farley's house and dove in head first.The Magician's Land exemplifies what the final book in a trilogy should be. No one is left unchanged. Everyone gets their curtain call. All the questions are answered. We finally get to find out what happened to Alice. Eliot acts like the bad ass king he knows he was born to be. Julia comes back. And Quentin finally becomes a master magician AND an adult instead of a callow complainer.Much like the previous book, The Magician's Land is told in two threads that eventually converge. Quentin and Plum, the new character who blessedly does not love nor want to sleep with Quentin, take part in the heist and then scour the globe for answers. Eliot and Janet search Fillory for the cause of the breakdown of magic. Things don't converge until around the 70% mark.One of the things I love about this trilogy is the magic system and Grossman pushes it to its full potential. Is the title a hint? YES! There so much more I want to gush about but I don't want to reveal too many of the nuts and bolts of the story.I liked this book quite a bit but I wanted to love the shit out of it. I thought the ending was rushed. In fact, I saw I was at the 92% mark and thought \"Isn't this the final book? Shouldn't he be wrapping this shit up?\" The bit was Asmo at the end felt like Grossman didn't have any ideas for the knife in the briefcase and only remembered it at the end. I also thought Penny and the Order's role in things could have been expanded. Those were pretty minor gripes, though.Lev Grossman's deconstruction of Harry Potter wrapped in a Narnia tortilla has come a long way since being conceived as an examination of the fantasy genre. Instead, it has become more imaginative than most fantasy books on the racks and gives a glimpse of the genre's potential if more writers will dare leave the confines of the Tolkien-via-Dungeons-&-Dragons box they've been shoehorned into. 4.5 out of 5 stars."}, {"userName": "Madeline", "userReviewDate": "May 22, 2016", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/111921-madeline", "userReview": "By now, I know what to expect when I start a book in Lev Grossman's The Magicians trilogy. There will be extensive, immersive world-building (Grossman is at his best when he is taking genuine joy from creating his own Narnia- or Hogwarts-like world, rather than trying to smugly point out all of their respective flaws), Quentin will stay just on the bearable side of utterly insufferable, there will be at least one character who I wish had an entire book of their own, and the last hundred pages of the novel will be so brutally unrelenting that it'll make me want to go back to bed and re-read the Narnia books to remind myself that fantasy stories that are more pretty than painful still exist.But The Magician's Land is different. The final hundred-ish pages of the book are not good-painful, they're just painful - in short, this book is less thank-you-sir-may-I-have-another, and more like a hundred pages of Lev Grossman smacking me with my own hands while jeering, \"Stop hitting yourself! Stop hitting yourself!\"The book, as a whole, isn't bad. The world-building is still rock solid and fascinating, and I love that Grossman is still creating new things for me to discovery in Fillory. The story also benefits by moving the timeline forward, and setting this book about six years after the events of The Magician King. So now, instead of dealing with whiny, entitled twenty-somethings, our characters are world-weary almost-thirty-year-olds who are finally, FINALLY figuring out how to be grownups. Quentin, after being kicked out of Fillory at the end of the second book, has mostly spent his time since then just bumming around, until he gets an offer to return to Brakebills - this time as a teacher. While there, two important events happen: Quentin runs into Alice, who we last saw turning into a niffin at the end of Book One; and Quentin is contacted by a group recruiting magicians to steal a mysterious magical objects. Meanwhile, Eliot and Janet are still kicking around Fillory, fully settled into their roles as king and queen, when they receive disturbing news: Fillory is dying. Like I said, most of this book is actually very, very good. I especially loved Eliot and Janet's sections, first because I will never, ever tire of the \"modern young adults react to old-school fantasy setting\" schtick, and Janet and Eliot are a perfect blend of snarky can-you-believe-this-shit and genuine, unashamed love of Fillory and its magic. I especially loved Janet, who after two books of being little more than a token mean girl and a contrived wedge between Quentin and Alice, finally gets her due. The little bits we learn about what Janet has been doing between the second and third books is fascinating, and I would honestly re-read the entire Magicians series if it was rewritten from Janet's perspective. She's brave, funny, tough as nails, and takes absolutely no shit from anyone - whether they're Quentin \"never was there a tale of more woe\" Coldwater, or a giant magic snapping turtle. Her best line, when Eliot is trying to brainstorm ways to save Fillory: \"We could put on a show! We could use the old barn!\"So yeah - lots to like here, if I'm being honest with myself, and plenty of other reviewers have spent time praising these elements. Go read their reviews if you want to hear how The Magician's Land is brilliant; I'll probably agree with most of their points. So without further ado, here's what made me furious about this book. It essentially boils down to three points.One: Grossman is doing a lot of telling and very little showing when it comes to Quentin's development as a character.To hear Grossman tell it, Quentin is a completely different person than he was in Book One. Grossman is correct, to a point: Quentin is no longer an entitled little shit who believes that if one world isn't up to his standards, the universe should oblige by creating another one for him (this is, in fact, exactly what happens at the end of the series, but I guess it doesn't count because Quentin didn't explicitly demand it, or some bullshit like that), and he sees people as they really are, not as characters who must fit into his personal narrative in a specific way. But Grossman is just so insistent about how much Quentin has grown as a person, telling us every few chapters that \"Quentin had changed so much\" or \"Quentin was a different person now\" and it felt like he realized that Quentin wasn't actually that different from the kid we met in Book One, and had to overcompensate. Also, certain events in the story are given much more weight than they deserve. The death of Quentin's father is portrayed as a massive, earth-shattering event that permanently changes Quentin, but since his father was never even a real character in the story, his death had no real weight for me, no matter how many times Grossman insists that it did (and oh, does he insist). Also, remember Professor Mayakovsky, of Brakebills South? We revisit him in this book, and he's suddenly recast as a wise father figure for Quentin. Is Quentin merely latching on to the nearest male authority figure as a way to cope with his father's death? Probably, but Grossman isn't interested in exploring this idea, and Mayakovsky remains in the role Quentin has assigned him. How nice.Two: Alice and Julia, the two biggest skeletons in Quentin's emotional closet, are never treated as well as they deserve by Quentin or the narrative. First, Alice. She turned into a niffin at the end of Book One to save Quentin and the others, and when Quentin encounters her again in Book Three, he decides he's going to save her. When he does, newly-human Alice is understandably furious with him - there's a much-quoted passage where she rips him a much-earned new one, but I can't be bothered to find it now. Rest assured that Alice is full of righteous fury, and every ounce of it is absolutely deserved. And then it's all dropped completely, and Quentin and Alice have sex and skip off to save Fillory together. Grossman doesn't go quite so far as to make Alice get back together with Quentin at the end, but it's clear that he believes everything is cool between them now. NO. I love angry Alice most of all, and Grossman robbed her of any real closure in favor of showing Quentin, the once and future king of Fillory, saving the day and (basically) getting the girl once again. Alice's rage, ultimately, doesn't matter, and Grossman kind of makes it seem like this rage is merely a side effect of her experiences as a niffin, rather than her own feelings.Julia isn't treated quite as badly, but like Alice, she deserved more closure with Quentin than she got. Grossman never really stops the explore the fact that both of these women were essentially destroyed as a direct result of Quentin's actions, and he never has to answer for that. Three: Grossman has gotten so caught up in the fun of creating a fantasy adventure, he forgot what he was trying to say in the first place.The Magicians was presented as a response to the Harry Potter and Narnia books - an unflinching, realistic portrayal of how those idealized magical worlds would really function, and reveal the cracks in their perfect facades. Lev Grossman gave an interview once (which of course I can't find now) where he says that one of the points of The Magicians is that nobody actually gets to be the Chosen One - Quentin, ultimately, is just a guy who stumbled into a magical world. He isn't special, because in real life, nobody is special. No one is chosen.So what happens at the end of The Magician's Land? Quentin saves all of Fillory by pulling a sword out of midair, kills not one but two gods, then becomes a god himself and remakes Fillory, and he does such a good job that he eliminates the need for gods in Fillory. He gets rid of the godlike powers once his work is done, because he's just so damn noble, and the day is saved and everyone cheers. So in the end, Lev Grossman has written the exact same kind of book that he tried to debunk: a very special schoolboy travels to a magical land and becomes its king, then its savior, and all is well. What was the point of all that cynicism, all that fucking smugness from Grossman, if this was the book he was writing all along? Like, Jesus, dude, it's okay to say that you genuinely like the Narnia books. Adding darkness and death doesn't make your book smarter, or more mature. And deconstructing tropes and archetypes doesn't mean shit if you're just going to indulge yourself in all of them in the end."}, {"userName": "Anne", "userReviewDate": "Apr 04, 2017", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/1720620-anne", "userReview": "Warning: Mild (ish) spoilers for the first 2 booksI like the way Grossman tells stories. I mean, none of the books in this trilogy are told in the same way, which just gave it a little extra sumpin-sumpin, in my opinion.In the first one, everything plods along in this somewhat linear way with Quentin first discovering magic is real, moving through his education at the magical Brakebills, then finding out Fillory is real, which leads to losing everything and giving up magic, and finally (in a cliffhanger twist) becoming a king in that magical land. Hogwarts, then Narnia, then home, the Narnia again?I mean, it's all over the place!In the second book, it's mainly a Fillory adventure story. Sure, some of it happens on Earth, but the core of the plot is finding the key to a special place in Fillory, and saving all magic. But what makes this one special is the way Julia retells her story. Told in flashbacks from her point of view, you find out what she went through while the rest of the cast of characters were farting around in school or traipsing through the Neitherlands.And this last book?The first bit of the book is told by flashing back and forth between the past and the present, the rest is linear (but split between several characters) and, towards the end, an important chunk of the story is told through the diary entry of a long-dead character.Maybe it was just me, but I liked that Grossman didn't use the same formula every time.Ok. I'm not going to give any spoilers, but I will say that I really enjoyed the conclusion to this trilogy. Quite a few things happened that caught me off guard (in a good way!), the addition of Plum was a nice bonus, and getting a peek into some of the other characters' psyche was a lot of fun!But one of the best things about this last book was seeing how much Quentin had grown up. No, he wasn't perfect, but he was definitely more mature and less of an ass.Oh, and speaking of Quentin being an ass?There was that one character I had been dying to find out about, and (thankfully) The Magician's Land didn't let me down!So, how does it all end? Well, I can't really tell you without ruining it, but I will say I was satisfied with the way it all turned out.Well...ish.Also, if you are a fan of the Syfy show, don't go into this expecting it to be anything like what you're used to seeing. I'm not a rabid fan who's seen a lot of it, but I can tell you from the few episodes I've watched this is not like what's on tv. I don't think that's a bad thing, but several of the characters have been changed quite a bit from the book (although I like the way they were changed), and it looks like there might be some characters who aren't even in the books. Again, not a bad thing. Just go into it knowing that you're getting a different story."}, {"userName": "Mary ~Ravager of Tomes~", "userReviewDate": "Apr 26, 2017", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/1452829-mary-ravager-of-tomes", "userReview": "What an excellent conclusion to a fabulous series!!There is so much to appreciate here across all three books. This final installment came out a nose head of the others because the conclusion was lovely & terrible & extremely fitting.It's so weird to me that I actually came to love & appreciate all of these characters to this extent. They are irresistible in their own defective sort of way.To put it frankly, they're a bunch of elitist asshats, flawed to the bone, and it's arguable that none of them deserve to be considered heroes.But the growth & developments each of them experience is so satisfying.Grossman has unleashed into this world a tale so clever that I'm left wondering at the skill it must've taken to walk this line. Coming up with a story like this is one thing, but executing it properly & consistently on every front is a separate feat, and one that Grossman has conquered masterfully.I've said it now in all three of my reviews, but this is definitely not a series everyone will be able to accept. Its individual components of cynicism can be difficult to reconcile with the obvious parallels to well-loved series that make up a foundation in fantasy for a lot of us. On top of that, not everyone is excited by the prospect of their ideals about magic torn up by the roots.It feels like one of those situations in high school where everyone is forced to read a literary classic, and by the end half the class is head over heels in love while the other half is wondering why such a book even exists. However, I have truly enjoyed every moment I've spent reading this series. The conclusion is subtle, and it's easy to miss the point if you aren't paying attention. Superb characterization, writing, and storytelling. I'm not sure what more I could've asked for in a final book.This review and other reviews of mine can be found on Book Nest!"}, {"userName": "mark monday", "userReviewDate": "Feb 17, 2016", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/131922-mark-monday", "userReview": "[a happy ending! one that revels in the power of the human imagination and the potential for humans to connect in a meaningful, emotional way! wow!

It was a while since it had felt like that. This was a serious quest, maybe the last one. What happened now truly mattered. Eliot had struggled before he found Fillory, he knew that: he drank too much, he found clever ways to be nasty to people, he never seemed to have an emotion that wasn\u2019t either ironic or chemically generated. He\u2019d changed in Fillory, and the thought of going back to that, of becoming that person again, frightened him. He wouldn\u2019t die with Fillory, he\u2019d meant that when he said it, but if Fillory died Eliot knew that something in him, something small but essential, wouldn\u2019t survive either.\u201d\nMap of Fillory.Eliot is not wired to be a nice person. He is immature, too intelligent, a stimulus junky, sarcastic, wickedly funny, but only really dangerous when he is bored. He is the High King of Fillory, a magical world that he and a handful of other followers discovered. The rules fit them like a glove. By just arriving they become Kings and Queens. If only Earth had recognized them in the same way. Fillory, like the books that inspired it, is about quests. By book three Eliot has settled into his role and knows that quests are essential not only to give his overheated brain something to ponder, but also something to shake him out of the funk of contentment. It is also important for him to vanquish foes, solve puzzles, save the world etc. just so the heralds have something to say beyond: The Good King Eliot kept the peace. Thank goodness a tribe called the Lorians, Vikingesque, primitive people, try to invade Fillory. After defeated them and pushing them back Eliot decides to fight their champion, not because it is necessary, but because he wants to add another notch to the legacy of his rule. \u201dVile Father\u2019s brown nipples, on the ends of his pendulous man-cans, were like dried figs. He had no scars at all on his smooth skin, which somehow was scarier than if he were all messed up.\u201dVile Father, interesting name, vile indeed. Eliot doesn\u2019t, of course, play fair, that would be ridiculous, he amps up his strength, speed, and power through magic. Otherwise, the diminutive, nasty little Viking would have kicked his privileged ass back to Castle Whitespire. As it turns out this little dustup with the Lorians is only a distraction from a much larger problem. Fillory, though saved so magnificently in book two, is yet again in jeopardy of coming apart at the seams.\nTime is running out for Fillory. The Prodigal Son Quentin will have to return.Meanwhile, back on Earth, or really at Brakebills College resides our hapless hero from the first two books... Quentin Coldwater. After unceremoniously being ejected from Fillory in book two he has washed up on the green grass of Brakebills College. They welcome him with open arms despite the less than amicable parting that happened last time he was there. They even give him a job teaching. He is excited when they decide to test him once more for his best magical skill. The last test had been inconclusive leaving him directionless for concentrating on and developing his most natural ability. It sort of reminds me of those tests that are supposed to tell us what we are supposed to do for a living. I always ended up with no specifics, balanced, and with a counselor bouncing like a yippy, hyperactive, chihuahua telling me that I could do anything I wanted to do. \u201dIt was a bit of an anticlimax. You couldn\u2019t call it sexy, exactly. Not breaking new ground, so much. He wouldn\u2019t be striding between dimensions, or calling down thunderbolts, or manifesting patroni, not on the strength of repair of small objects. Life was briskly and efficiently stripping Quentin of his last delusions about himself, one by one, shucking them off in firm hard jerks like wet clothes, leaving him naked and shivering.\u201dSelf-delusions are hard to maintain under the best of conditions, but poor Quentin keeps having life greet him with a resounding slap across the face, followed by a knee to the groin, and a finishing, stinging, karate chop to the back of the neck leaving him stunned, vulnerable, but very much alive so that he doesn\u2019t miss the rest of the... pain...of living. He gets banished from Brakebills. Quentin\u2019s life is one long series of being 86\u2019d. He seems to always be in the mix of whatever is going wrong and this was no exception. In his defense he was trying to save the life of a student, Plum. As it turns out she is the last living descendant of the original Fillory discovering Chatwin children. So it was meant to be...right? Quentin is low on funds and needs a pile of cabbage if he is going to pull off what he NEEDS to do next. It is two fold really, one becomes meshed with the other. If he can\u2019t return to Fillory and he can\u2019t be at Brakebills well then he would\u2026I need to pause for a moment. Most people when they want to tell the world to go screw themselves, buy a cabin in the woods. Too mundane for Quentin. ...create his own world.\u201dThe air was thick with the smell of burning metal and the sweat of tired magicians. She could sense it in the room with them now, the land itself: an angry, hungry, thirsty infant thing demanding life, ready to take it from them if it had to. It cried out with an almost human voice.\u201d Of course one might think that by creating your own world that there would be no way, no how, that anyone could kick you out of your own creation. By definition you are GOD. That should be true, but one should keep in mind the Steve Jobs rule. I did say there were two problems that Quentin needed to rectify. The second part is that Quentin has discovered that his girlfriend is a demon. Well they were on the outs when she perished in the great fight in book one, but still nothing like dying young and having people pining for what would have been.I have one, well maybe two, demon ex-girlfriends, but unlike Quentin I\u2019m not willing to expend any amount of energy, magic, in trying to humanize them. So what is it like being a demon...erhhh\u2026Alice?\u201dImagine knowing, always and forever, that you are right, and that everyone and everything else is wrong\u201dJust as I suspected! They are beautiful creatures, these demons that haunt Quentin and I. \u201dHer expression when she focused on him, was black. She was angry, a wasp who\u2019d been trapped in a jar and then shaken, and she was ready to sting. She was the most beautiful, terrible thing he\u2019d ever seen, like an acetylene flame, an incandescent filament, a fallen star right in front of him.\u201dI\u2019ve seen that look. The need for cash forces Quentin to attend a clandestine meeting in a bookstore, with an annoying talking crow, and a group of cast off magicians. Quentin\u2019s days of looking down his nose at anyone are dust in the rearview mirror. This is a heist along the lines of  with everyone bringing a necessary specialized skill to the table. Speaking of books, they litter the landscape of all three novels. Magic and books twine together still showing the power of words on paper/parchment/vellum and the strength of words spoken in the proper order. \u201dShe would have known it was a library with her eyes shut: the hush of it was enough, like a velvet nest in which she\u2019d been carefully nestled, and the smell, the heavy spicy aroma of slowly, imperceptibly decomposing leather and paper, of hundreds of tons of dry ink. Every square foot of the walls was bookshelves, and every foot of every shelf was full. Creamy spines, leather spines, knobby and ribbed spines, jacketed and bar, gilded and plain, blank spines and spines crammed with text and ornament. Some were as thin as magazines, some were wider than they were tall.\u201dA book orgy has broke out on this poor young woman\u2019s back!A flying books experiment at Brakebills went very wrong. With these animated books going beyond the bounds of the spell and actually...having sex. \u201dWhich sounds interesting, but so far the resulting offspring had been either predictably derivative (in fiction) or stunningly boring (nonfiction); hybrid pairings between fiction and nonfiction were the most vital. The librarian thought the problem was just that the right books weren\u2019t breeding with each other and proposed a forced mating problem. The library committee had an epic secret meeting about the ethics of literary eugenics which ended in a furious deadlock.\u201dI say let them breed and damn the consequences.Lev Grossman has magically lost all of his hair while writing this trilogy.I must say I appreciate Lev Grossman bringing forth the growing number of Jeff Goldblum obsessives out of the closet. I wouldn\u2019t call myself an obsessive, but I have a strange attraction to his movies. It is a similar problem that I have with the characters of this trilogy. They are not likable; and yet, completely compelling for me. I couldn\u2019t put any of these books down except when drooping eyelids or real life events offered interference. After a magnificent ending to book two this book felt like the trilogy was wrapping up with a whimper instead of a roar. When I was mentally recapping the book and all that I experienced in it\u2019s pages I realized that there was a lot of A game in this book as well. We learn a lot of back stories that filled in some gaps. We also learn more about the writer of the Fillory tales, Christopher Plover. He proves the point that the one who writes down the memories is the one that controls the history.

Following various quests and a whole lotta heartbreak, Quentin is back in the real world and gives himself a very personal mission to complete even while his friends back in Fillory learn that the end of that world is very nigh.Quentin has been a Rorschach test of a character since the beginning. Is he a spoiled ass who can never be happy or appreciate the amazing opportunity he has?

Or is he a potential hero tripped up by the expectations that his fantasy nerdom have instilled him with?There\u2019s some truth in all of those and no shortage of readers who couldn\u2019t stand Quentin or his friends. I had problems with him, too, particularly in the first half of the second book where it seemed that Quentin had regressed, and I would dearly have loved to give him a slap to the back of the head.However, I always had the feeling that Lev Grossman was taking us somewhere with Quentin, and that I couldn\u2019t really know the guy until I knew how he turned out in the end. Here\u2019s where that belief paid off for me with Quentin, now 30 years old, finally acting like an adult, and there\u2019s some genuine sadness in the idea that Quentin may have finally outgrown his childish things.While he\u2019s more mature, he\u2019s still a magician and one thing Quentin hasn\u2019t lost is the wonder and possibilities of the fantastic. Now it\u2019s just tempered with the realism of a guy who is a crusty veteran of many battles and seasoned interdimensional traveler. Grossman also shifts perspective to several other supporting characters in a variety of circumstances from an attempt to steal a magically protected object to witnessing a final apocalyptic battle in a world tearing itself apart. The other characters have gone through similar arcs so that they seem less like hipsters tossing around ironic comments about being in a fantasy story and more like magicians fighting for things they care about who are still capable of throwing out some one-liners about being in a fantasy story.This final book in the trilogy pays off on a lot of levels and manages to wrap up most of the loose ends without seeming so tidy that it came in box with a bow on it. All of it feels rich and detailed, and best of all, it feels like it mattered.Also posted at Kemper's Book Blog."}, {"userName": "Terry ", "userReviewDate": "May 28, 2013", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/1262683-terry", "userReview": "[Alice is dead/MIA through magical catastrophe? No problem: Quentin brings her back easy-peasy using that spell he happened to randomly find in the Neitherlands. Quentin is going to be called to account for taking said spell and keeping it for a year by being incarcerated in the Neitherlands library? Wow, the actual enforcement by magical society for the transgression of one of their laws? And the guy enforcing it is so good he can beat the other magicians three on one in a magical duel when they try to stop him? Ah, don\u2019t worry about it, Alice will just punch him in the face and that will be enough to cow him to follow you around and do what you say. Funny! And ironic! Right. Fillory is dying and there\u2019s apparently no way to stop it? No worries: Quentin will take it upon himself to sacrifice the old gods, attain godly power to re-make it, and then give up said power right away. I mean, I just found this problematic on so many levels. Is it really his place to make the choice to sacrifice Ember? Doesn\u2019t a god\u2019s sacrifice in order to save his creation need to be done at his own behest? It just seems to kind of cancel out the whole legitimacy of the act for me if someone else makes the decision for him. And then when Quentin gains godly power to re-make his beloved world? Here we go, I thought, now he will have to sacrifice his humanity, his newly re-gained love, and everything else in order to be the new god of Fillory and keep things going, right? A real choice fraught with consequences! Um, not so much. He just gives up the power *poof* and Fillory is back, he gets to keep his humanity, he can see where things go with Alice, and everything is back to normal. I just felt kind of cheated.

If I ever feel uncomfortable in a strange place, as long as I see books around I know I will be OK:):):) If one thing is true about this series it is that the writing is flawless! Nothing is to much or to little. The characters are exactly as the author intended for us to perceive them. Their actions are even more telling than their internal monologues, just as I prefer it. The author has a very clear picture of what he wants to say and has the amazing ability to deliver. If it was only up to technical and plot creation, this book will deserve all the stars possible. However, I had a very subjective issue with it, and it is very much a matter of personal taste. I just didn't like the points he was beating us over the head with. ...Sure, I see what the author was striving for, but it was way to bleak in a very realistic way, for me to enjoy myself while reading it. And there was almost no humor whatever, which for me is very important in any over the top internalizing and searching for life's meaning premise. There is plenty of irony and some sarcasm, but it felt very unnatural and forced. However, this last book in the series managed to at least end on a hopeful note, if not with a promise of eternal happiness.

It's taken a far more realistic look at the likely outcomes of people being gifted with ridiculous magical powers, of what that horrible moment when you finish university and are suddenly expected to be a fully functioning member of society would be like if you had unlimited resources, and how adventures like those portrayed in the Narnia books would truly, and completely, fuck you the hell up. In this final volume the messed up characters from the first two novels are a little more grown up, it's a true coming age of novel and one that resonates much with my own life. In fact, I think this book may well have helped me heal a little bit of the pure burning hatred and rage that I have for The Last Battle (of the Narnia series). And that is an impressive feat because I have been raging over that book for almost twenty years. One of the great joys of this series, and this book in particular, is how it's a real book-lover's book. If you were that kid who escaped off to another world through the pages of a novel you'll hear what this book is saying. In the world of the Magician's those other worlds happen to be real but I don't think Grossman considers the worlds of Harry Potter or Narnia to be any less real or have any less of an affect on our lives as Fillory has on those of the characters in these books. There's a moment where Elliot and Janet are journeying across Fillory and they stand for a while on a hill looking out over the landscape before going on 'to Barien' and I was suddenly struck by how much these books are like the Keats poem - On First Looking In To Chapman's Homer. MUCH have I travell'd in the realms of gold,\t  And many goodly states and kingdoms seen;\t  Round many western islands have I been\t Which bards in fealty to Apollo hold.\t Oft of one wide expanse had I been told\t  That deep-brow'd Homer ruled as his demesne:\t  Yet did I never breathe its pure serene\t Till I heard Chapman speak out loud and bold:\t Then felt I like some watcher of the skies\t  When a new planet swims into his ken;\t Or like stout Cortez, when with eagle eyes\t  He stared at the Pacific\u2014and all his men\t Look'd at each other with a wild surmise\u2014\t  Silent, upon a peak in Darien.Kids, it doesn't get better than a book that can make you quote Keats, where the magical characters can quote Harry Potter, where fantasy is at once ripped apart and yet glorified.

This story takes us back to places from both of the first two novels, among them Brakebills, the magical college that Quentin Coldwater (the main character) attended, the college that started it all. We also get to see Fillory again, through the eyes of Eliot and Janet, who are still there ruling as High King and High Queen. This story also follows Quentin into the darker side of magic, only previously seen through Julia\u2019s eyes. The story predominantly takes place in the current timeline, with some history being told through a journal. This truly is a story of finding one\u2019s way, thus giving the reader a feeling of uncertainty and wonder.This novel takes place around six months after the events in The Magician\u2019s Land. Quentin is no longer the 18-year-old we met in The Magicians. He is 30 and still trying to find his way, which I think speaks to many readers; we are always learning and growing. He has definitely grown from the cynical, angry boy that he was when he first discovered Brakebills. He changes throughout this novel as well, he is able to get past things that were once holding him back and change into the person that he really wants to be. I would be interested to read more about Quentin\u2019s journey in the future (hint, hint Lev Grossman). There is another character that changes quite a bit, but unfortunately I can\u2019t talk about it, unless I give up a large spoiler! We also get introduced to a new, younger character in this novel, Plum, who has a surprising connection to Quentin and his world.This book definitely hits the ground running. The previous novel has you wondering what was going to happen next and The Magician\u2019s Land jumps right into it. Lev Grossman also jumps back and forth between the setting of Fillory and the real world. He does this with grace and does it in larger pieces, rather than constant back and forth. I got what I was expecting from this novel: a great story with many surprises and a satisfying ending. I was so happy to be back in a world I love with characters that I\u2019ve missed for the past three years.The Magicians trilogy is probably one of my favorite trilogies. It is a great story of magic and fantasy, but also a story of growing up. Quentin\u2019s adventures and trials shadow much of what it is like to grow up and find yourself. I also enjoy Lev Grossman\u2019s take on magic. It\u2019s not innate or simple, it is hard work. Magic is scientific and messy. It depends on the weather, the person\u2019s emotions, and the time of day. The pop culture references are amazing as well. There are so many little nuances that bring this story to life. Lev Grossman throws some fun things in there, quirks to the land of Fillory and the school of Brakebills that would be endlessly entertaining. One example would be of the books in the library at Brakebills, they start breeding thus creating subgenres. The idea of one of these hybrid books is funny and very interesting. The description of every setting in these novels makes you feel like you are there, with the characters, going on an adventure. Lev Grossman\u2019s world building is fantastic. I cannot say enough about these books, I highly recommend them to anyone.Lev Grossman is the author of The Magicians trilogy, as well as two standalone novels: Codex and Warp. He has also written for Time magazine. He is on Goodreads, Facebook and Twitter (@leverus). His favorite magical land to live in would not be one from his books, but Narnia. You can find his novels at any major book retailer or your local library.I would like to thank Viking for sending me an advanced copy of this novel. I have been eagerly awaiting this since I closed The Magician King. I cannot tell you how excited I was to receive it in the mail. I hope this review brings many more readers to the wonderful world Lev Grossman has created."}, {"userName": "Bradley", "userReviewDate": "Jul 07, 2015", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/4213258-bradley", "userReview": "Strangely enough, I worked through all of my reservations from the previous two books, having liked the first book well enough, and on reflection liking the second one much less, I discovered that passing the hump of the heist in the third allowed me to finally relax into the story after finally realizing that Quentin wasn't going to remain a douchebag forever.The heist was fine, as far as that went, and his just going along with everything and sliding along with his life was par for course. It wasn't that surprising, but I was rather amused with the situation. I even caught myself reimagining the tale as one of discovery from the side-character's pov as they went about their sneakthievery only to realize that this ponce used to be a king of Fillory. There wasn't too much of that, of course, but it still amused me to think about it.Later on, during the great hiding, the time wasting, I finally realized that Quentin was actually doing something with his life instead of coasting. From that point forward, I began to root for him. The resulting changes seemed like brief backsliding, but in the end he eventually did the right thing. And then he did the right thing again. And again. I started wondering if I was reading the same set of novels. When did this idiot start growing up?And then it happened. After slogging through two and half novels of disliking this boy-man, he finally redeemed himself. We finally have a rounded character, and he was good. What a shock.Getting in on some of the povs of the other superfriends didn't leave me dissatisfied, either. Jane was pretty interesting, and Elliot also had his moments. Penny, well... Penny was Penny. He'll probably remain a dick forever, which is a shame, because I identify more with punks than wastrel spoon-lickers with a mysterious silvery paste on their tongues.Julia. Out of everyone, I think I'd prefer to have novels devoted to her and her ascension to 3/4ths of godhood. I'm sure there's some pretty good storytelling hidden somewhere in there. After the story of her rise in the second novel, I wanted everything else to follow her about, but it just didn't happen.C'est la vie. The only recommendation I can really give for these books is that they all be read in the pure assumption that they are NOT separated by any silly delineation of book-binding. Just assume that all three novels are one ginormous volume meant to explore the ultimate growing up of a douchebag, and you won't go wrong. Then, it becomes rather pleasant. And isn't that what we all really want, in the end?Happy endings. They exist, even for these books. My relief is palpable.

Which is a funny thing to say about a book written as well as this one, and that made me as happy as this one did at certain points (really, I would read hundreds of pages about the magic in this universe and how it works and doesn't, no plot required).The thing is, this book doubled down. The series as a whole has been playing with coming of age narratives and coming into power narratives, trying out different ones, contrasting them, complicating them. And then this final book just . . . plays it straight. I was worried by the jacket copy which, in my edition, actually says something about \"a boy becoming a man.\" Okay, but not really, I thought, that's just stupid marketing nonsense.Guys. This book is about a boy becoming a man, and what that means for a boy who loves magic and stories about it. Really. Like, this book actually thinks Quentin is interesting (he is, in flashes, but come on, not really). It is actually invested in Quentin's angst over not being quite as special as he thought he would be. And then it's really interested in having a little interlude about how very special he truly is \u2013 no one loves fantasy literature like Quentin, apparently, to the point where the universe takes notice. For real.Here's the thing. In every book of this trilogy, I found myself thinking at least once, okay, but why aren't we reading a book about her? It's always a her, and she's always interesting as hell, and her story is always more complicated and harrowing and difficult than Quentin's. In the second book, we did actually get to read about her, thank you very much, and it's no coincidence that book is my favorite. In this book, we don't get to read about her. And I would much, much rather have been. Because as this book was winding up, delivering a few thematic statements and the like, I just kept saying, wait, really? You're really . . . going with that? That's what this has all been for? We did all this to talk about the hero's journey of . . . getting over the ennui of being really lucky and privileged?But as I said to my girlfriend, you can object to a lot of what Grossman is doing, but it's harder to object to how he's doing it. I really would read Grossman on magic for books and books. A sample:And lately, they'd [books] begun to breed. Shocked undergraduates had stumbled on books in the very act. Which sounded interesting, but so far the resulting offspring had been predictably derivative \u2013in fiction \u2013 or stunningly boring \u2013 nonfiction. Hybrid pairings between fiction and nonfiction were the most vital. The librarian thought that the problem was just that the right books weren't breeding with each other, and proposed a forced mating program.

Josh and Poppy were useless and served no purpose except offering more bodies, they weren't even likable anymore. The climax was wrapped up way too easily and neatly.

The world was a desert, but he was a magician, and to be a magician was to be a secret spring - a moving oasis. He wasn't desolate, and he wasn't empty. He was full of emotion, full of feelings, bursting with them, and when it came down to it, that's what being a magician was. They weren't ordinary feelings - they weren't the tame, domesticated kind. Magic was wild feelings, the kind that escaped out of you and into the world and changed things. There was a lot of skill to it, and a lot of learning, and a lot of work, but that was where the power began: the power to enchant the world.\"\u201cThis is a feeling that you had, Quentin, she said. Once, a very long time ago. A rare one. This is how you felt when you were eight years old, and you opened one of the Fillory books for the first time, and you felt awe and joy and hope and longing all at once. You felt them very strongly, Quentin. You dreamed of Fillory then, with a power and an innocence that not many people ever experience. That's where all this began for you. You wanted the world to be better than it was.\u201d\nSo . . . this series turned out to be kind of genius. I'm so, so glad I gave it another shot. I would have missed out on what turned out to be, frankly, a very moving reading experience there at the end. In fact, it's like Grossman heard every single one of my complaints from five years ago and addressed them directly. Seeing as how that's both extremely unlikely and pretty narcissistic, I'm thinking what actually happened is that he designed the story to be this way, only you had to be patient enough to see it all the way through. The books are definitely meant to be read together. None of the books make much emotional sense on their own, and that includes the first one. So if you were like me and gave up after that one, I would very much suggest giving it another go.The Magician's Land picks up after the last book. Quentin has been kicked out of Fillory, and he's actually trying to make a go of it in the real world instead of moping around and feeling sorry for himself about how awful everything is. He ends up back at Brakebills for a while as a Professor, which is where he meets Plum, a thankfully very platonic acquaintance whose fate turns out to be tied up not only with his, but with Fillory's. The plot cycles back and forth between flashbacks to the past six months, trips over to Fillory to check in with Janet and Eliot, and an actual for real crime caper that Quentin and Plum sign up for in the present day that involves stealing a very powerful magical object on behalf of a mysterious benefactor. All the while, it turns out that Fillory has reached the end of its lifespan. Fillory is dying. It was so much fun watching all of the plot threads from the last two books come together. It was also ridiculously emotionally satisfying. And Grossman is one of those tricksy writers who can also make stories work on multiple levels. You just know he wants you to analyze the shit out of this book. You don't have to, but you can if you want to. It probably also helps that the Narnia books make up a significant portion of my literary childhood, and in many ways these books are Grossman's way of processing his own adult emotions about fantasy stories, and the Narnia books in particular. For me, though, this series turned out to be about what it's like to become an adult, to realize that the best way to live in this world is to try and make it more like you wish it was, like you know it could be. Like Quentin does with magic, Grossman creates worlds with his emotions, with flicks of his fingers, and I'm so glad that he does.[4.5 stars]"}, {"userName": "Caroline ", "userReviewDate": "Feb 26, 2013", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/3236194-caroline", "userReview": "***NO SPOILERS***Grossman's third and final installment in The Magicians trilogy brings back all the beloved key players from the previous books, plus a few new ones, but probably won't enthrall fans quite as much as they're expecting. The Magician's Land focuses on a thirty-something Quentin Coldwater on a quest to solve a complex mystery with the help of a precocious Brakebills student. Whereas book one focuses primarily on magical school Brakebills and book two on magical land Fillory, this third book has a combined focus. It's an effective way of tying up the series, but much of the time it makes for a frustratingly disjointed narrative with an inconsistent tone.Each character shares time in the spotlight here, but that does make for a clunky, disruptive narrative. One chapter focuses on events in Quentin's life; the next focuses on Eliot's; the next on another character; and so forth. There's nothing unusual about this kind of format, but it seems it's been done more seamlessly by more experienced authors. The previous two books in this trilogy have a much smoother narrative, and they're stronger because of it.Grossman's style is all his own, and the very thing that's great about it is also its downfall at times. Something so striking about The Magicians series is Grossman's unique vision. He snatched the stars out of his magicians' eyes, removed all trace of wonderment from the magician archetype, then relayed this in a modern, cynical, \u201creal\u201d voice. This is no J.R.R. Tolkien high fantasy seriousness; Grossman's style jibes perfectly with his special take on magic and magicians.Disappointingly, that special style tripped him up a bit in this final book. The Magician's Land is told in the third person but shifts very awkwardly when the focus is on a specific character. This is glaring in chapter five, where the focus is on Eliot. Here the narrative shifts into a pseudo-first person. There's a sense Grossman's aim was to give him a very distinct voice, a sort of peek-inside-his-head, but there's a strangeness to it, a flippancy to the prose that lowers the caliber several notches. This also is very much true of the occasional slang and text-speak term such as \u201csqueeing,\u201d \u201cheart\u201d as a verb, \u201cFTW,\u201d and \u201clulz\u201d in the prose, as opposed to in dialogue; to say those hurt the integrity of his writing is a vast understatement. It's as if Grossman wrote when he was in different moods; at times his prose is just too casual, at others, sophisticated. The story shines when the tone is the latter (though a few humorous asides somehow do work). He is most definitely a gifted writer, but he faltered trying to establish just the right tone, and the story suffers for it, though not so much that it totally fails.Where The Magician's Land is weakest is actually at the technical level. The punctuation is so terrible that this point can't not be mentioned. It's unusual for a lack of commas to be this widespread, but here, semicolons and a comma following an introductory clause are rare things indeed. To cite just one example of the latter kind of error: \u201c--when magicians played the cards had a way of changing sides...\u201d Even the non-discriminating reader will spot these problems and likely find them grating, at least some of the time.More than anything, what makes The Magician's Land truly worth reading is its many gripping and visually stunning magic scenes. Really, this is true of the trilogy as a whole. It's in the magical world-building that Grossman shows the full extent of his creative talent, and quite a boundless creative talent that is. Most noticeable and admirable is that all the reader's senses are fully engaged. The magic in this story is very much a palpable one, and it's clear Grossman expended a great deal of creative energy in crafting his magical world from every angle, down to the finer details. In particular, his take on magical spell work is a knock-out; that many spells have a highly complex mathematical foundation is an innovative touch that lends a certain authenticity to the world he created. Perhaps some elements could benefit from a spin-off story that would provide some necessary fleshing out, but what is here as-is dazzles and enchants. Like the world of Harry Potter, the world of Quentin Coldwater will have readers yearning for a portal to transport them there.Final verdict: A flawed but nonetheless satisfying ending to The Magicians trilogy."}, {"userName": "Samantha", "userReviewDate": "Oct 06, 2013", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/1582662-samantha", "userReview": "[(Don't worry, nothing as nearly as upsetting.)

Just a few minor complaints keep me from giving it a 5 star rating. 4.5 stars.Audio book: Mark Bramhall again does an excellent job that makes this a series I think is best done in audio. I will have to be on the lookout for other books he reads for in the future.\nFull Review\nThis book almost made it to the end to secure one of my rare 5-star ratings. I always hated to stop listening, and found myself coming up with things to do so I could get in some extra listening time each day.Unfortunately what seems to be Mr. Grossman's need to remind us that life is never fair and far from perfect at places, that I'm frankly sick of. I read to escape from reality, and while I'm not looking for everything to always work out, the negativity of this series wore on me at points.Thankfully the amount of it seemed to lessen with each book. I think that largely has to do with Quentin's development. He has gone from a character I was indifferent towards, to one I didn't like, back to largely indifference in the last book, but at this point in the series I found myself finally liking him.I find it hard to read a book where I don't like at least some of the characters. It's no wonder to me why so many people are turned away from the series by the first book.The world building and the story is what kept me going until suddenly I realized I had actually become fond of these characters. Who would have guessed that?This is one of those books that doesn't tie up every loose end. I think this keeps in line with Mr. Grossman's frequent injections of \"reality\" into the series.I don't need all the loose ends to be tied up to find an ending satisfying, and this was definitely that for me. I'd love to see more stories in this world. If not with Quentin as his friends, then maybe with other students at Brakebills. Preferably ones I like much sooner. I found Plumb a nice addition to the series, much as I did Poppy in the last book. It was nice to see that much like the real world, not everyone is so depressed and cynical all the time.Overall I've found this an enjoyable series, which is likely obvious from how quickly I tore through it. I'm cautiously optimistic about the SyFy adaptation based on early details. Here's to hoping they get to tell the whole story, and maybe some other ones beyond it."}, {"userName": "Michelle Morrell", "userReviewDate": "Sep 02, 2014", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/127000-michelle-morrell", "userReview": "First read: 2014: Exiled from Fillory, Quentin finds himself searching for purpose. We see a much more mature Quentin here, one who has definitely come into his own. He's not the only one, Elliot and Janet are fierce defenders of Fillory, realizing their dedication and determination to protect their world once it is threatened, first by invaders and then by news of imminent total destruction. Truly exciting to see the maturation.The message of disillusionment in childish things, of putting your past behind you and moving forward, of being your own source of strength is strong in this volume, all hard won lessons for Quentin. Reread 2016: Audiobook, swirling the story in my head three-fold now. Book, tv and audiobook have combined into one glorious lump of story. I still love these stories, now enhanced with a visual overlay from the fantastically cast tv show."}, {"userName": "Kenchiin", "userReviewDate": "Aug 09, 2016", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/41280039-kenchiin", "userReview": "I'm not sure if Lev was trying to deconstruct the fantasy genre or life itself, but he accomplished to do both."}, {"userName": "Doug Bradshaw", "userReviewDate": "Sep 08, 2014", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/808994-doug-bradshaw", "userReview": "If you enjoyed Narnia and Harry Potter and you have little bit of religious background, a Torah here and a Bible there, you may have as much fun as I did with this twisted and modern version of those two series. It\u2019s all there, magic, talking animals, angry Gods, war, fantastic journeys to faraway lands, sometimes being transformed into geese or even whales, with normal humans, sometimes kids, placed into high positions in these lands, even as kings and queens. It\u2019s amazing that such nonsense can have real meaning and sometimes pierce your heart and teach you a little bit more about love, life and relationships. But the story really got to me here and there and as these young, sometimes nerdy smart misfits grow, and their personalities unfold over 12 or so years, a very real and sometimes harsh coming of age story is told. In this regard, it\u2019s less a fairytale and more of an up close and personal view of kids growing awkwardly into adults with all of the mistakes they make along the way. And there are several very touching and sometimes disappointing and horrible things which happen, some of which get solved, others of which remain unsolved and almost too real.There is swashbuckling, hands severed, unfit Gods, loving Gods, moments of real and excellent magic, creations of new earths that are entered through a simple door in the side of an apartment and finally, the maturing of the characters and the final climax formed by years of planning, practice, schooling and magical demonstrations to save a beloved world, perhaps a bit of Frodo and Bilbo thrown in here. Compelling and excellent story that I will always love.I\u2019d go to five stars, but the last book sometimes seemed too edited down, the storylines weren\u2019t always told well enough and there was a little too much kidding around here and there that sometimes took me out of the story into the office of the author who is obviously a clever jokester. So, again, if you love this type of story, give this series a shot. I was entertained and hope there are more books coming. I can think of a dozen side plots that could easily be developed.Thanks to Caroline and other Goodreads friends for inviting me to enjoy the adventure."}, {"userName": "Vita", "userReviewDate": "Jan 13, 2014", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/27630076-vita", "userReview": "The Magicians trilogy means a lot to me. It's a complex coming of age story that I can identify with so much that it hurts sometimes. I want to say that the trilogy came to me during a difficult time in my life, but really it came at a time when the difficult part had been and gone, and I was left reluctant to find out what happened next. The theme of the Magicians trilogy fits so beautifully with that empty and exciting feeling that it became a part of my grieving process, and continues to be now that I've finally reached that next stage in my life.This third and final book came to me as an advance reading copy, several months before its actual publication date (complete with lost final-proof commas galloping heedlessly through the middle of sentences), and so I will not spoil it for anyone who may be breathlessly anticipating this book as much as me. With waiting so long for something I loved so much, I was foolishly prepared for the worst, and happily handed something satisfying and beautiful and far less dark than I was hoping for, but it was for the best. The main character is not a dark and brooding introvert anymore, and neither am I. Quentin grows up. Quentin has daddy issues, and tries to fix things, and learns his discipline, and saves a life with bacon. Quentin clings to the past and lets the past go, and though I didn't want it to end, The Magicians trilogy wrapped up as satisfactorily as I could have hoped for, full of snarky Harry Potter references and page-turning set pieces.Second book is still my favorite, though."}, {"userName": "Mogsy (MMOGC)", "userReviewDate": "Jul 15, 2014", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/4379514-mogsy-mmogc", "userReview": "4.5 of 5 stars at The BiblioSanctum http://bibliosanctum.com/2014/08/05/b...I practically binge read this series, which is unusual for me. But truly, it is a rare pleasure indeed when subsequent books in a series just get better and better. I\u2019ve had such a change of heart about this trilogy from the first book to the last book, that I am actually floored with amazement. I certainly don\u2019t take back my thoughts in my review of The Magicians \u2013 I liked the book but I also had some very real issues with it and those still stand \u2013 but by God, it\u2019s hard to believe how The Magician King and now The Magician\u2019s Land have managed to completely revive this series for me.We\u2019re at the third and final book at this point, so it\u2019s going to be hard to summarize it without giving away spoilers. Suffice to say, protagonist Quentin Coldwater has been through a lot since finding out the magical world of Fillory from his beloved childhood fantasy novels is actually real. He has been its king, explored the farthest reaches of its borders, been ejected unceremoniously from the realm by its god, but through it all Quentin has always had his magic. We return to Brakebills College where he takes on a position as a junior faculty member, but when that falls through, Quentin\u2019s going to need to find another way to make money and make it real fast, especially for the plans he has in mind.For you see, Quentin has never truly forgotten Alice, whose fate still haunts him daily. She was my favorite character in The Magicians, and to my dismay, I thought we had heard the last of her by the end of that book. So yes, it was invigorating to discover that her story might not be over yet. When it comes to the first book, saying that Quentin had an attitude problem is a massive understatement; I believe I wrote that the only cure for his malaise was a few years of growing up and possibly a swift kick to the seat of his pants \u2013 except what happened to Alice was more like a knife through his heart. What happened to Alice defined and transformed his character, so I was also happy to see things come full circle.The book also has two very distinct parts. In the first half, we have an exciting heist which, departing from convention, doesn\u2019t go well at all \u2013 but everyone who knows me know how much I love a good heist story. And trust me, you wouldn\u2019t want to miss how spectacularly disastrous it goes for Quentin and his partners in crime. The action and the dry humor in this book is ramped up to a whole other level, which is something readers have always loved about this series.The second part of this novel focuses on Quentin and his old friends\u2019 quest to save Fillory. Like all good things, it must come to an end, but not if the old Brakebills gang has anything to say about it. The Magician\u2019s Land was at times thrilling, at others touching, but always it was full of wild magic and fantastic imagination. My only complaint? The link between the two story threads was tenuous at best and the transition between them was very abrupt (whatever happened to the others involved with the heist? \u201cBetsy\u201d got a throwaway mention at best towards the end of the book, and I wouldn\u2019t have minded more Stoppard, I liked him a lot!) but despite this, I have to say the story never faltered in engaging me and holding my attention.In essence, The Magician\u2019s Land achieved something that all series-enders should strive for. Not only does Grossman tie everything together, he does it in a way that makes you think back to the earlier books and it suddenly occurs to you: Oh, so THAT\u2019S what he was setting up for. The first book The Magicians was a coming-of-age tale which felt rather aimless at times, if I\u2019m to be honest. But somewhere between its last hundred pages and the first hundred pages of the book two, I think the series finally found its direction. From then on out the story took off, straight and steady, and as a result, this last book is marked by a certain cohesiveness that makes sense \u2013 that just feels right.And Quentin. Quentin, Quentin, Quentin. If it is possible to feel proud of a fictional character, it is the feeling I get for him after reading this book. What a far cry from when I wanted to wring his spoiled, whiny neck and throttle the life out of him in The Magicians. He grew up. He grew up a lot. He became someone I liked and admired, and as infuriatingly annoying as he was in the first book, I don\u2019t know if I would have appreciated his growth and character development this much if he hadn\u2019t been so unappealing to begin with. He was a shallow, self-absorbed child who ultimately became an adult worthy of his magical gifts, and it is a testament to the author\u2019s pacing and writing style that it was a journey that didn\u2019t feel forced or contrived.My final thoughts: I may have stumbled a bit with the first book of this series, but the way I see it, it\u2019s always better to read a series that gets stronger than to read one that goes downhill after book one. And so, I tentatively recommend the first book The Magicians; after all, it\u2019s one of the most polarizing books I\u2019ve ever read. It seemed as many readers loved it as hated it, while some others like me fell somewhere in between. But I felt a lot more positive towards the series with The Magician King, and as the last book of the trilogy, The Magician\u2019s Land was a solid finale. My thoughts on book one aside, I think the trilogy as a whole is fantastic and absolutely worth experiencing. What an adventure it has been."}, {"userName": "Danny ", "userReviewDate": "Sep 30, 2015", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/8943230-danny", "userReview": "\u201cIt didn\u2019t matter where you were, if you were in a room full of books you were at least halfway home.\u201dI ended up really loving this conclusion to the trilogy, especially after not enjoying the sequel that much.
