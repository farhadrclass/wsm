Sophie believed her childhood nightmares were safely behind her once she married and moved to the U.S. from France until she is called to her mother, Marcelle s, deathbed to honor one final request: Search for my father! Search for Pourrette! Born on the last day of World War I, Marcelle, whose life epitomizes the human cost of war, never knew her father, yet carried the Pourrette name, along with the shame of illegitimacy, as did her two oldest sons born during World War II. Enlisting the expertise of a friend and family therapist, Sophie encourages Kate to join her in France to help find her grandfather scour the stain of illegitimacy from her family s name. Unbeknownst to Sophie, Kate s 34-year-old illegitimate daughter, given up for adoption during the Vietnam War, has recently reappeared. Kate, struggling with her own shame and guilt, pushes aside her feelings to join Sophie in France. Rising out of the collateral damage wrought by war, A Cup of Redemption is a touching story about love, loss, and the search for identity.\"I liked Cup. It's different from just about anything else I have read. I have to admit that I made an immediate connection to Marcelle, who the reader finds out is dead in the 1st 4 lines of the book. After I read the stories about her with Sophie and Kate, I felt a little bit of loss. Crazy. The story is mostly about Sophie looking for answers to a lot of questions about her parents and her siblings. But Kate's self-exploration plays a big part too. There are a ton of characters, and it would have been confusing - except that Carole has a List of Characters at the front of the book with 26 names on it. It's important to refer to that list on a regular basis so as not to say \"Now, who's that again?\" Or even \"Who's that?\" Most books don't need that list, but this one does.Carole's writing is very good. In describing Kate's 1st meeting with her husband, he says to her: \"Even from far away, I can hear your smile.\" That's pretty darn romantic. And when Kate talks about her children, she says: \"Two of her own children hadn't launched well and kept returning as if on bungee cords.\" That's quite a visual. Again, keep your eye on the List of Characters, and you will enjoy this book. Another strong debut novel from another local author. As I've said many times before, the Bay Area is loaded with good solid authors."}, {"userName": "Teddy", "userReviewDate": "Oct 26, 2014", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/271544-teddy", "userReview": "Based on a true story, Sophie was raised under traumatic circumstances. Her parents were part of the French Resistance during WWII and married during that time. Her mother, Marcelle, already had two illegitimate children, Thierry and Gerard, earlier during WWII. Jules, Marchelle's husband was violet towards the children, especially the oldest, Thierry.Marcelle, herself was also born as an illegitimate child and never knew her father. Sophie, her daughter, was called back to France from the U.S., to Marcelle's death bed. Marcelle's dying with was for Sophie to find out who Marcelle's father was.After her mother's death, Sophie's friend, Kate, joined her in France to help research who Sophie's grandfather was. On their odyssey, they discover many answers to family secrets. Meanwhile, Kate had secrets of her own.I loved 'A Cup of Redemption', I couldn't put it down and when I did, I couldn't stop thinking about it. It haunted me, especially at night, trying to fall asleep. Once I did fall asleep, I dreamed about it, almost non-stop. Seriously, I would wake up to relieve myself, have troubling falling back asleep thinking of the dream I just had and then, when I finally fell back asleep the dream picked up where it left off. I have never experienced a book like I experience 'A Cup of Redemption.' This book and characters will stick with me for the rest of my life, of that, I am sure. This is a must read for historical fiction lovers!"}, {"userName": "Kate E.

American Kate meets French ex-pat Sophie and her mother Marcelle in her quest to perfect French cooking. This chance meeting leads them all on a life changing adventure.After meeting Kate, 80-something Marcelle begins to open up about her life and her past in ways she never has before. The new-found friends plan a cross-country trip to retrace Marcelle\u2019s movements through WWII France. The trip is never to happen, as Marcelle dies suddenly. But she leaves directions for Sophie and Kate to make the journey with Marcelle in spirit. In a search for Marcelle\u2019s roots, they uncover darkness, secrets, and long lost knowledge that changes both their understandings of themselves and family, eating lavishly along the way.It is apparent that Carole Bumpus is a first-time fiction author; the narrative is rough around the edges. However, Bumpus\u2019 project is so compelling, and the journey so rich, that it is thoroughly worth reading. So, while I would give the bones a 2 \u00bd, the meat is definitely a 4 \u00bd, so I\u2019ve compromised. (Look for my review of Carole\u2019s companion cookbook Recipes for Redemption and find my interview with Carole on San Francisco Book Review )"}, {"userName": "Linda Marie Marsh", "userReviewDate": "Jan 05, 2015", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/33245752-linda-marie-marsh", "userReview": "\"The heart of a woman is as deep as the deepest sea.\"  I could leave my review finished with that one statement and i think you'd get it....Many others have offered the story line so let me just say that there is a fine line dividing the bonds of family and friends, this is the story of women with family secrets, long-held hurts and questions , and lthe love of cooking all tied up together. Tied up, and slowly unwrapped like a gift tot the reader as the book progresses! Go re-read that first line of my review again...."}, {"userName": "Josephine Ensign", "userReviewDate": "Jan 23, 2016", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/14011182-josephine-ensign", "userReview": "An interesting novel in terms of depicting the destructive tentacles within generations of a family due to 'secrets and lies' and the traumas of war. I'm not a huge fan of any book with 'redemption' or 'redemptive' in its title or description--and I'm not a fan of dialogue-driven narratives, but this one was quite sweet in its own way. Plus, having just met the author in person, I can attest to the fact that she is as warm and genuine as is 'Kate'--the character who is really Carole in the novel. I haven't seen it yet, but I imagine her companion recipe book is scrumptious."}, {"userName": "Rachel", "userReviewDate": "Jan 09, 2015", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/23603459-rachel", "userReview": "I received this book from the goodreads first reads program.Every book takes the reader on a journey and this journey was hauntingly beautiful.
