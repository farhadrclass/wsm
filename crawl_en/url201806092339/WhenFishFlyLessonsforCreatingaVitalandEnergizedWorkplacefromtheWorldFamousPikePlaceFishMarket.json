As a food lover, this is a place that I am eager to visit one day. I did not realize what an amazing business model the market is, and that a number of small businesses, large corporations and school districts have used the lessons the market has adapted over the years to positively shift the way every employee, supervisor, and the owner sees themselves and the impact of their work on the world. Pike Place Fish Market has been around for over forty years. They were doing ok and getting by, but the owner, John Yokoyama, wanted to try to expand the business into the wholesale fish business about twenty years ago. This failed miserably, and the business was in danger of going under. Instead of giving up, however, he sought the advice of a coach who helped him to re-frame his thinking. He re-evaluated how he viewed his management style, his employees, and the future of his business. Yokoyama explored what his business would look like if he was able to create a new vision for his business along with his employees, and that there might be a greater purpose to his business than just selling fish.This is a powerful little book about the power of positive thinking. I hope my coworkers will take a few hours and listen to this message, and I believe it would serve anyone working in any kind of organization well. GPL owns the audio version of this book, and it is available for checkout. If you prefer to read the book, and have an evergreen card you may order it from GPL."}, {"userName": "Shelley", "userReviewDate": "Jan 09, 2017", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/7211373-shelley", "userReview": "i'm sorry that this the first book i read in 2017 because it is seriously poor. he needed a ghost writer. he needed to say something other than \"we're awesome because we act awesome\" - without including any details on HOW. i love this pike place fish market. i've been there many times, and always smile when i walk past the flying fish. i often reference to other people who want to market things that they have to create a 'flying fish' otherwise no one pays attention. Sadly this book doesn't talk about the ideas behind the flying fish (why do it, what it changes when you create a participatory environment with clients). Instead this book says vapid things like \"We serve as communication coaches, helping the staff determine that all conversations are not created equal. Some conversations support and empower people in their commitment to express themselves as world famous fishmongers.... Every powerless conversation can be released so that a bountiful catch can be made.\" This isn't even the worst example, it's just the random place where I opened the book (page 72). argh."}, {"userName": "Jay", "userReviewDate": "Dec 13, 2017", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/1618357-jay", "userReview": "I found \u201cWhen Fish Fly\u201d to be an interesting business history and a nice set of business anecdotes. The business was purchased by an employee, the author, who rules with an iron fist until he received some education and decided to try something different. That something different was to attach the term \u201cworld famous\u201d to everything his company did. That became a mantra, a lens through which all employees were tasked to view every situation, especially those situations dealing with customers. I was reminded of astral projection when I read this book. In astral projection, a person comes out of their body and views their body and their situation from a different perspective, looking down and reviewing. What Yokoyama repeatedly did in this book is to tell his employees to \u201craise\u201d their perspective above the situation, to ask themselves how they are acting and if their actions represent a \u201cworld famous\u201d organization. In his examples, the request was usually enough to change attitudes and actions. The success of this tactic on his employees, mostly blue-collar workers, was quite remarkable. I personally use this tactic myself and have tried, unsuccessfully, to pass it on to my kids using the concepts of right and wrong. I think I need to look for something that resonates better! Interesting for the business story \u2013 you don\u2019t get many books written about running a fish market. And this story is representative for many businesses, from a small-town mechanics shop to a large software company. And interesting for its take on using a slogan to motivate employees. Many of the slogan rollouts I've seen in my career did not include the repetitive reminders of how to apply the slogan that Yokoyama illustrates here."}, {"userName": "David Steele", "userReviewDate": "Mar 23, 2016", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/12195496-david-steele", "userReview": "John Yokoyama and Joseph Michelli. When Fish Fly: Lessons For Creating a Vital and Energized Workplace. New York: Hyperion Books, 2004, 158 pp. $15.68Whenever I have the chance to take a guest to Seattle, one of the first places on the list is Pike Place Market. Anyone that knows anything about Pike Place knows that the tour would be incomplete without visiting the World Famous Pike Place Fish Market. Each guest has a chance to see fresh salmon flying through the air. The seafood acrobatics are matched by an enthusiastic team committed to fulfilling the vision of the market. But there\u2019s nothing fishy about this Seattle based company. Everything that unfolds before the guests is carefully thought out. The details are revealed in the book, When Fish Fly: Lessons For Creating a Vital and Energized Workplace by John Yokoyama and Joseph Michelli.When Fish Fly is an inside look at the success of the Pike Place Fish Market. The authors work through eight foundational pillars which drive the business plan:1. Creating a vision of power and possibility as a team.2. Enrolling and formalizing individual commitment and team alignment to the vision.3. Helping team members distinguish between the state of being and the state of doing.4. Having the leadership redefine themselves as effective agents of change.5. Assisting team members in letting go of internal and external conversations that rob them of their personal power.6. Guiding team members to listen to make a difference instead of listening to defend or blame.7. Helping the crew live their commitment to one another through effective coaching.8. Assisting crew members as they turn snags into breakthroughs. Each of the business principles is explained and explored in greater detail. Yokoyama\u2019s tale is sure to inspire new entrepreneurs and veteran business people alike. There are many nuggets here to mull over ruminate on. But the one thing that stands above all is the commitment the author to people. The author is more concerned with influencing people than a financial payout. Yokoyama writes, \u201cAll of us can come together and benefit from generating bold visions of the future. You have an opportunity to positively empower people \u2026 I invite you to create a powerful vision for yourself and others in your community.\u201dWhen Fish Fly is a worthy read or anyone who has a passion to make a difference in the lives of people. Well done, Mr. Yokoyama!"}, {"userName": "Stefan Kanev", "userReviewDate": "Oct 12, 2014", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/1969876-stefan-kanev", "userReview": "A great book about a great workplace.This book tells the story of, ahem, World Famous Pike Place Fish, a fish market in Seattle. It used to be quite unsuccessful and unrofittable, but the owner managed to transform it (and himself) applying a very curious philosophy to the workplace. One they decided that they want to make it \"world famous\". They committed to that vision eventually succeeded. This book tells the elements of the philosophy that helped them accomplish it.It's a very inspiring book about management.On the down side, it's not greatly written. It feel repetitive at places and the ideas are not structured in a good way.

I would say he gets to the how-to point, but with him it might be the how-to-be point. That is, he says we focus too much on how to accomplish a certain goals believing we can do so effectively without being changed ourselves. Instead, he says our main focus should be on being the person we want to be with the attitude we aspire to and that results will change as a consequence. His illustrations are good, and he is completely candid about the mistakes he has made as an owner and manager.
