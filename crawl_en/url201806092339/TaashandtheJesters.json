My 6th grade teacher read it aloud to us (way back when) and the entire class was gripped. Thereafter I borrowed and re-borrowed the book from the library, and in adulthood finally tracked down a copy via on-line to read to our own children. We just finished it (again) in bed-time reading to our 8-year old, and I was once again enthralled. It is probably best age appropriate for 10-12 year olds, but certainly appeals to those older and younger. Our 8-year old daughter was able to follow it, although, admittedly, there were a lot of vocabulary questions, as in what does [fill in the blank] mean? It has a terrific vocabulary - even my husband was stumped by some words. (For example, how many youth or even young adult books use the word \"sere\"?)It is appropriate to post this review today, June 24, 2014, as this is author Ellen Kindt McKenzie's 86th birthday. Sadly, there is remarkably little information about her on line, at least that I was able to access, but it appears that she is still living, and resides in California. Ms. McKenzie, I love your book! Happy Birthday! You are a treasure!"}, {"userName": "Kevin", "userReviewDate": "May 11, 2017", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/10017362-kevin", "userReview": "This is the very first novel I read in grade three. I remember the story to this day and the magic of how it fired up images in my mind and feelings in my body. I started me on my lifelong love of reading. I told a very kind and caring friend about it once and she found a copy online and bought it for me for my 45th birthday. I read it and enjoyed it again, then sadly lost it in one of my many moves. Hope to find another copy and keep in my collection."}, {"userName": "Miss Clark", "userReviewDate": "Oct 11, 2011", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/1467942-miss-clark", "userReview": "3.5 starsA very original and inventive tale of a young orphan, Taash, who had been raised in a cruel and abusive home in a village where he was treated like scum until the day the local witch was given the care of him. Of course, Bargah is not quite the witch she is made out to be and she, along with her companions, a young girl about seven or eight, and Kashka, a jester to the king, give Taash a home and an education and a family. It takes him a long while to warm up to them, but he starts to open up. He looks up to Kashka and idolizes him. All the while, there are hints that there is something sinister after Taash and that he is not just some orphan.Taash gets dragged through a pool into a glen where he sees some witches with a baby performing some ritual. He snatches the baby and runs away. He calls the baby Teyal and is given shelter by a shepherd family. Eventually, after rumors about the missing infant prince start to get around, Taash knows he has to get the child back to his parents, so he sets out with Teyal and Lia, the eldest daughter of the family with whom he was staying. They are joined by Piff, another jester with an uncanny resemblance to Kashka. They are beset by danger and enemies but in the end, after being reunited with Bargah and Kashka, they are able to return the young prince to the king and queen, unmask the evil, cunning courtiers (although the witch Lady Ysene got away) and it is revealed that Taash is actually the king's younger brother who was stolen away as a toddler to be used in much the same fashion as what Ysene and her witchly sisters had planned for Teyal if Taash had not rescued him. It was Kashka who foiled her plan back then. So, all ends pretty well other than Ysene being on the lam.I would have loved for more characterization between Kaskha and Piff and Taash. More background on Bargah. And what happened to Lia? Such an abrupt ending, alas. Still, fun read."}, {"userName": "Angela", "userReviewDate": "Feb 26, 2012", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/7106904-angela", "userReview": "This is one of my all time childhood loves. And I still love it!! My grade school librarian suggested it for me. I was an constant reader and was running out of books to read in our small library. Mrs. Oswald would always have something ready for me to grab onto. Many decades later I still enjoy this book so much that I had to seek out my own copy. This is a story that completely grabs the reader and whisks them away to another time and place. I would recommend this to every young person to read... especially if they don't currently enjoy reading."}, {"userName": "Jane", "userReviewDate": "Jul 02, 2009", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/288945-jane", "userReview": "One of my all time favorites--read it again to celebrate my 50th birthday!"}, {"userName": "Yvonne", "userReviewDate": "Sep 13, 2010", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/4030659-yvonne", "userReview": "An absolutely charming book.
