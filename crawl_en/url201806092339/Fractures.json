In essence, it takes the concerns of Jonathan Franzen\u2019s last two novels (The Corrections and Freedom) and puts them together \u2013 giving the story of a dysfunctional family facing environmental and ethical crises.Architect Frank Joyner has been holding out against the fracking companies encroaching on his town, but when his son warns him that he may face \u201ccompulsory integration\u201d before too long, he starts cultivating a relationship with a Texarkana derrick man who\u2019s come to negotiate with local landowners. \u201c[T]he confrontation between a Normal Rockwell vision of the country and a heedless rush to energy exploitation was too good to pass up.\u201dIndeed, an issue like fracking makes for good headlines, and decent narrative drama. Herrin is not always as subtle as one might hope (one woman says of fracking: \u201cIt sounds like animals in pain!\u201d), but he uses the metaphors of rock and foundations to good effect:\u201chis father had always seemed like bedrock America to him.\u201d\u201cHe thought of a man moving to shore up the world, to hold off collapse\u201dThe imagery might be a little obvious, but I enjoyed the almost biblical weight Herrin lends to what\u2019s happening here: \u201cthe strangely futile clamor of some elemental transgression.\u201d While not as successful as Freedom or Richard Russo\u2019s Empire Falls, to which Fractures has also been compared, it\u2019s a solid (no pun intended) modern American story."}, {"userName": "Ron Charles", "userReviewDate": "Nov 03, 2013", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/1384944-ron-charles", "userReview": "Lamar Herrin\u2019s new novel, \u201cFractures,\u201d revolves around a technique for extracting natural gas from rock, which sounds about as interesting as extracting natural gas from rock, but it\u2019s surprisingly moving. Here\u2019s an environmental novel that does just what you want it to do: Frame an important contemporary debate in profoundly human terms.Hydraulic fracturing \u2014 commonly known as \u201cfracking\u201d \u2014 involves drilling deep into the earth and then injecting liquid and sand under tremendous pressure to create small fissures that allow gas and oil to flow up the well. Something like that pressure is now being brought to bear on our politicians: Energy companies claim that fracking is an economical way to answer our thirst for cheap fuel; environmentalists argue that it\u2019ll poison us for generations.A novel is no place to adjudicate that scientific debate, but Herrin gives us family members forced to make the choice for themselves, and their struggle to reconcile economic demands with personal ideals transcends the shrill tone of so many environmental arguments. The story opens in central New York in a rural town where most of the farmers have already leased their land to a gas company. Frank Joyner, a 60-year-old architect, is a prominent hold-out and public critic of the derricks that have arisen all over the county. Although his neighbors may be irked, his 11-year-old grandson, filled with the righteousness of youth, considers him a hero for resisting the lucrative deal.As is so often the case, it\u2019s money that complicates this family situation. Frank inherited his 100-acre farm under a will that requires him to share the profits of the land with his siblings and children \u2014 and suddenly those profits could be very large, indeed. Frank\u2019s lawyer warns him, \u201cIf you willfully neglect the value of the land by not signing a lease, you are willfully reducing its benefits,\u201d giving a distant relative grounds to sue.Herrin quickly pushes us through a lot of industrial information and introduces a number of family members, but that allows us to fully enjoy the story\u2019s central event: a large Thanksgiving gathering during which relatives discuss the pros and cons of drilling on Frank\u2019s farm. The scene is a fantastic orchestration of competing interests with all the subtly disguised hurts, jealousies and affections heaped on the table like so many dishes of turkey, cranberry sauce and sweet potato. Herrin is unusually good at adopting various points of view and allowing us to feel these loved ones as they try to influence Frank, while noting, politely, that the decision is his alone, of course.\u201cIt\u2019s going to happen whether we like it or not,\u201d his sister tells him, \u201cso we might as well share in the benefits. . . . Wisconsin has its cheese, Maine its lobsters, and we have our gas. We\u2019re all pitching in.\u201d His ex-wife, meanwhile, claims she doesn\u2019t want the money. \u201cAll she wanted was for her husband \u2014 ex-husband! \u2014 not to embarrass them all.\u201d And his younger son, Mickey, tells Frank to resist the gas money and \u201ccommit the symbolic act.\u201dHow we should act is the real heart of this brooding novel, which moves beyond its timely environmental debate to consider more existential questions with great discernment. That\u2019s particularly true of Mickey, a popular high school teacher who skates along with \u00adposes and ironical quips, burdened by too much feeling, too much intelligence and not enough discipline.\u201cFractures\u201d doesn\u2019t overwork the metaphor implicit in its title, but clearly these characters are drilling deep into their lives, trying to find some bedrock they can depend on. Frank\u2019s grandfather and great-grandfather committed suicide, and he made a halfhearted attempt in his 20s that still haunts him. Indeed, the novel opens with the most weirdly gorgeous act of self-harm I\u2019ve ever read. A lifetime of restoring old buildings and making worn-out spaces useful again has given Frank a sense of the value of surviving. But can his children engineer that kind of purpose?If \u201cFractures\u201d has a flaw, it\u2019s a tendency toward grandiosity that sometimes spoils the emotional authenticity of Herrin\u2019s narration. The touches of antique diction \u2014 \u201cHe had plighted his troth\u201d \u2014 often carry a note of irony that makes them work. But other sections are pumped full of meaning under high pressure. In the face of a devastating tragedy, for instance, one of the Joyners thinks, \u201cAll advances in civilization . . . had messy beginnings, some of them barbaric. Lewis and Clark themselves had left a trail of blood and butchered carcasses behind them. Of course, they\u2019d had manifest destiny on their side, while the gas drillers had energy independence and a network of pipelines in handsomely cleared corridors across the land. At every turn a wise man took a long view.\u201d That sounds a lot more like an Author trying to erect a Big Point than a real person mourning the death of a loved one.But \u201cFractures\u201d is uncommonly thoughtful about many issues, starting, of course, with the externalities of our energy needs and the costs of American ambition. At 73, Herrin also brings tender wisdom to his observations about the responsibilities of parenting, the duties of real manhood and the possibilities of romance. The novel offers a rare blend of candor and eroticism that doesn\u2019t make you wince with embarrassment for the author. And Herrin is astute about the nature of love for older people, too. Frank\u2019s relationship with a widow in town is one of the story\u2019s many lovely moments. \u201cShe felt for him deeply,\u201d Herrin writes, \u201cas she knew he felt for her, but there was a limit to what they could do for each other. She might have been stationed on one side of a gorge, he on the other. They could make reassuring signals to each other. On good days they could even read the expressions on each other\u2019s face. Some days shouting didn\u2019t make it across, but on others, days of a blessed calm, a whisper did.\u201dPlenty of readers will enjoy Herrin\u2019s book for its lustrous writing and poignant insight into the challenge of building a life worth living. But if you also want a novel that addresses a pressing political and environmental issue, \u201cFractures\u201d is worth exploring.http://www.washingtonpost.com/enterta..."}, {"userName": "Penny", "userReviewDate": "May 21, 2014", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/4966171-penny", "userReview": "This book is simply awesome.

But, I thought his exploration of the dynamics of fracking interesting, engaging, and thought provoking. It's a clear reminder that nothing is ever simple. Frank Joyner, who doesn't want to allow gas drilling on his family property is beset from all sides -- those who think he should maximize the profit for his family and support energy self-sufficiency for his country, making him a patriot and those who think it is an abuse of the land and are concerned with the effects caused by it. The title Fractures doesn't just refer to hydrofracking but also the fractures within families. The fractures in the Joyner family are played out against the backdrop of the fracking debate. Definitely worth a read."}, {"userName": "Wendy", "userReviewDate": "Sep 23, 2013", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/16831198-wendy", "userReview": "\"Fractures\" by Lamar Herrin which I won from Goodreads Giveaways centres around the Joyner family whose land sits atop the Marcellus Shale; like gold to avaricious gas drillers who compete for drilling rights in the area. The story is not political in nature although it does expose some issues about the hydrofracking controversy, rather it revolves around Frank Joyner's decision whether or not to lease the land and the motivations of family members who try to sway his choice. Burdened already with a dark family legacy, the story looks at how a dysfunctional family handles the tension of competing opinions and emotions, and how tragedy could end the quarrel.The language of the characters is simple and straightforward as a plot unfolds that takes the reader on an emotional roller-coaster, their problems eroding the bond of family as they argue about trading the beauty and peace of the farm for money. It's fascinating to watch as money and pragmatism outweigh any destructive implications of gas drilling in the family's assessment.All of the characters suffer from personality flaws with the exception of young Danny who seems to have a level of maturity beyond that of his mother and Uncle Mickey. He wisely learns to counterbalance his negativity about gas drilling through his grandfather 's shrewd insights and Kenny's experience.  There is a marked contrast between the characters, both the women and the men and how they deal with the troubling events in their lives. Frank, the patriarch of the family is influenced by a generous, considerate nature succumbing to the stronger will of his sisters. He's troubled by his ineffectiveness in handling his family and that dark vulnerability that he identifies with the scar on his wrist. Family-oriented Gerald the oldest of Frank's two sons has a stronger disposition but he's distanced himself from the instability of his family while Mickey, the youngest is troubled, indecisive and tends to flee from responsibility, personally and professionally. Even Jennifer and Helen compare; one with low self-esteem identified by her innate sexuality who's adverse to commitment, and the other level-headed, loving and wise.The story is well-written and is a gritty, no-nonsense look at a dysfunctional family struggling with a decision that will further impact their lives set amid a volatile social controversy. The ending although not surprising is tragic and although there is a sense of futility there is hope that the human spirit in this family will eventually triumph.

We begin with the main character Frank talking about suicide running in his family and how he had struggled with it. Next we are given a tragedy of a little boy being hit by a large auto machine, while the boy lives the company of said vehicle tries to push the incident under the rug. Hm, that's interesting and dusting is probably more common than thought. Anyway, I felt these subjects were so subtlety recognized that I forgot they had been stated. Understanding that the novel was entitled Fractures and is about fraking, but at times I felt it was rammed down my throat. I get it, fraking is bad. It almost felt like propaganda and was reading a leaflet rather than a novel.When we move towards the close of the book Timmy reemerges but it came so out of the blue that it took me a moment to realize it was the little boy who was hit on his bike and turned the page without much reflection. As I was reminded of Timmy, The suicidal trait in the Joyner line does come back into play and I thought perked up the plot (a weird thing to say about suicide I know) but by that point I was almost finished and just wanted to put the whole thing to rest.  The Joyner family did not bring me joy. They were actually a wreak and like the title of this novel -- fractured. Yes we all have our faults and I will not judge them for it, but I felt they lacked personality and didn't engagement me, nor did the plot for similar reasons.Overall, Lamar Herrin had an interesting summary but unfortunately that's about it.

Some novels are good and some are okay. This novel was a great read. Characters so well drawn that their actions and storyline are believable. Not once did I shake my head and think 'that made no sense' which unfortunately does happen sometimes but not this time.The leasing of family property to a large natural gas company for hydrofracking (the process they use to drill for natural gas) is a part of this story but it's really the story of a family. The decision is up to the head of the family, Frank Joyner, who has been left the land by his parents with a proviso from his mother to share the benefits with the family. He wonders if leasing is the right thing to do at a time when there is a grassroots movement to stop the drilling because of the chemicals used in the process or is it better for the family to lease and share out the money with all of them.His family has a dark history and his own children over the years have drifted in and out of his life. He and his wife divorced long ago. His daughter finally returned and settled with her son, who now lives with Frank, while she lives in town. His eldest son lives with his wife and two girls in California and his youngest son moves from job to job and state to state.

I would say they book-blurbed simply because he wrote about fracking or knew him, not because they loved this book. They don't write like this, with the remove from their characters or at least not in their books i have read and loved. This felt very superficial, even though he was dealing with serious subjects; like I was watching his characters from behind a screen rather than live. His writing and descriptive patches were sometimes beautiful but I cared little about most of his characters. I never developed any strong pull toward any of them although I wanted to.

Family patriarch Frank Joyner is initially against letting his land be leased by gas companies, but finds himself more and more torn as warring opinions of his children, siblings, and even his grandson come into play. Herrin does an excellent job fleshing out the motivations of each family member and how these affect Frank, who must also take into account the family history of his land. I appreciated the plotline and the tie in of various members of the family but felt that some characters were superfluous to the storytelling.
