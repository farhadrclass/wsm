I started it once but put it aside for new books that caught my fancy. Last week I decided it was time to clean up all the unread 'orphan books in my kindle and I categorized all of them as currently being read on Goodreads thinking that would shame me into finally reading them all. I am a voracious reader and thought I would have accomplished my goal in a week. This book took 5 days to complete. Sometimes I just had to put the book down because I would be so angry with how the characters were being so cruel or very whiny and sometimes just boring. But I forced myself to finish it and I can say I am glad I did not because the ending was better than the rest of the book, but because it is over. My favorite character in the book is Holger, probably the least attractive, appears in the fewest scenes but has the most empathy of everyone in the book. I highlighted quite a few passages because I did like the author's voice in places. But if this was a road trip I was on I would describe it as a freeway with a few side jaunts that make the trip less dreary."}, {"userName": "K Korona", "userReviewDate": "Aug 09, 2017", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/40954742-k-korona", "userReview": "This is easily the worst book I've attempted to read in years. Maybe it's the translation, but the language is stilted and odd. I didn't like any of the main characters in the book. The plot revolves around the dysfunctional relationship between 3 sisters and their history of betrayal, lies, passive aggressive interactions, and selfishness. The lesser characters are one-dimensional. The entire book is made up of the character's thoughts, and very little else, the plot unfolds as in turn we get the perspectives of each sister on the same events. Interaction between the sisters is incomprehensible, and the 3 different perspectives of the sisters fail to make sense or clarify why everyone is so messed up. Not, not, not a good book."}, {"userName": "Lynda Kelly", "userReviewDate": "Aug 11, 2017", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/3565785-lynda-kelly", "userReview": "This was my Kindle First choice for August. It was a little slow and repetitive in places but I liked it and would definitely read this author again. Apparently she's written a lot but this is the first translated into English from the Swedish. The three sisters featured are all very different. I was one of three and it's a bad number, really. As two of them tended to gang up on the third, we did too. It was a different pair at different times but one was always left out of what two were maybe giggling about or kept out of what they were up to. These girls are the same, although it seems to always be the same pairing in this tale. I felt pretty sorry for Henrik most of all. He was such a good and decent guy who was taken advantage of a great deal, which was a shame.I did find there was a surfeit of tears throughout.....everyone was snivelling at one time or other !!There weren't too many errors throughout but the ones there were were howlers....this was written-hum3iliated-and how nobody spotted it is beyond me. Sluffed was used instead of sloughed but the worst by far was referring to Lena as Lean at one point....that was a huge old ouch and that cost it the 5* for me.It took me days to get through but I was away while it was on my reading list so wasn't reading as often as at home. A couple of times near the end I was sobbing......but there were also some funny little lines throughout as well. I'd certainly recommend it."}, {"userName": "Cheryl", "userReviewDate": "Aug 08, 2017", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/24878504-cheryl", "userReview": "The Heart Echoes opens with Astrid, the eldest of three sisters, purchasing cheese for the family party she is hosting to celebrate Viktor's graduation from high school. She wants everything to be perfect. Unfortunately, she is far from being the perfect wife and parent she wants to be. As we meet Astrid's sisters and mother it becomes apparent that there is a strong undercurrents of tension in heir relaionships wih each other. Throw in the complication of Michael, Viktor's biological father, whom Astrid has not seen since he walked out on her and their one year old son, and and a cancer death sentence and everyone's world is thrown off kilter.This beautifully wriiten story explores how childhood memories echo into adult lives. And how secrets, even those kept hidden for the best of reasons, taint relationships. The delicate interweaving of sibling rivalry, petty jealousies, misunderstandings, lies and expectations exposed by the women's grief is insightful and realistic. The humanity of each of the characters, their experiences and the locales are so compelling developed I felt as though I were there with the women as they struggled to make sense of what was happening.. By the satisfying conlcusion to the story I genuinely cared that everyone would be okay with the way things turned out.I am very disappointed to discover that The Heart Echoes is the only book by Helena von Zweigbergk that has been translated into English. I want to read more from this author."}, {"userName": "Kayo", "userReviewDate": "Aug 20, 2017", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/31710254-kayo", "userReview": "Had a hard time getting thru the book.

The characters are relatable in their flaws and in their strengths. The book is written from each sisters point of view, which f for me, made it more interesting and allowed me to see each sisters version of life. The ending came to soon and abruptly for my liking.

The writing seemed kind of choppy until I got used to it, I'm not sure if this is because it was translated to English. The book is related separately by all three characters which makes it seem repetitive. With the exception of Henrik, Astrid's husband, who is too good for her and Lena who is dying, the characters are miserable, unlikable people with messy lives and dysfunctional relationships. There is some reconciliation at the end. Most of the book drags. The exception being Lena's part, which I thought was well written from the point of a person with a terminal illness. That earned it the second star. I got this as a Kindle First choice and am glad I didn't spend money on it."}, {"userName": "Kate B.", "userReviewDate": "Aug 06, 2017", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/51632932-kate-b", "userReview": "Not good...Unlikeable & under developed characters.

Three sisters, all of whom have found what they thought was a great love but that they do not have at the moment. One sister is dying and they all end up looking closely at what they had and lost.

Flawed characters rich with flawed choices unwind their tale in a multiple perspective narrative. It's elegant and too real, the sisters and their families unraveling in self absorbed misery.Affection for the characters didn't draw me in, but curiosity about what would happen next. Not all of my favorite characters are good people, but they can still be captivating.The story keeps circling back to early or lost loves, how yesterday impacts today again and again. Poetic in sadness, it mires the ladies down in memories and dulls the present; a sound moral lesson as the characters slowly unravel from their original perceived perfect lives.The translation from Swedish is fascinating, with so many universal themes about life. Reading it as an American, it was interesting to see the differences in culture, like apartments being more the norm than houses and iPads for kids seen as a luxury, not a necessity nearly handed out in the delivery room."}, {"userName": "Deborah", "userReviewDate": "Aug 17, 2017", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/9129277-deborah", "userReview": "The story line was interesting. Three sisters who suddenly have to face the decisions they have made in the past that have taken them to the point where they are in life, while dealing with the illness of a loved one.I was looking forward to reading the book, but I found it disappointing. The characters of the the three sisters are well fleshed out, but there seems to be some contradiction in the way the characters act at times, which is okay, because few people are consistent in their reactions at all times in their life.I guess the main problem that I have with this book is the excuse that two of the characters were young and immature when they made mistakes or choices. From where I am from 24-26 year old are adults and should be held responsible for their actions. Instead of taking responsibility, they give excuses and run away from the problems.Their actions have impact on the rest of the family...which leads to my other \"problem\". Does it really take someone 16 or 17 years to come to terms with the past? The main character has married and started a family with her new husband. He is a loving and supportive spouse. I would think she would have found a way to move past her \"past\" by this time, after all she is described as an \"adult\", \"accomplished\" and successful career woman, wife and mother.The one sister, who is supposedly controlling and jealous of the other two sisters, appears to be the only sister who is actually loving, caring and selfless in her actions.This book is filled with grownups who are selfish, self-centered people who don't ever \"talk\" to each other, but instead are judgemental and more juvenile than the young teens/adults in the book. While the adults are harping at the children to stop acting so selfish, they in turn are much more selfish and self absorbed than the children, who are actually sweet and delightful characters.By the end of the book, I was happy that the characters were not my family or friends. This may seem harsh, and I am sure many people will find the book insightful, and I agree there are some poignant moments and thoughts, however I truly hope that most people are more loving, thoughtful, forgiving and mature than these characters. Overall, the book left me with a flat feeling. I am glad it was a free read."}, {"userName": "Keli Larson", "userReviewDate": "Mar 14, 2018", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/52100708-keli-larson", "userReview": "It's rare for me to want to stop reading a book, and I wanted to stop reading this one. It read like someone's unhappy diary. Very heavy on descriptive thought, rather light on dialogue. There's not enough character development early on in the book to be able to buy into the choices being made by the main characters; and the development that comes later (stilted and overly typical) seems to attempt to justify the characters' moral choices. The three sisters in this book each seem rather self-absorbed; one, perhaps, has reason to be - but regardless, all three seem to simply wallow in their current state of affairs and endlessly discuss in that descriptive thought that state of affairs. I think this book doesn't work because it wants to provoke inner reflection, but it's too heavy-handed and directionless. I don't mind a sad book; not at all. If the sadness is purposeful. This book is simply depressing. This read feels like that conversation you have over and over again with a friend who says they want to change but don't, really - they just like having the conversation about the idea of change. It's tiresome. It's difficult to commit to after some time. Parts of the storyline itself were intriguing enough to finish the book...But I wish I could say I enjoyed it more."}, {"userName": "Carol", "userReviewDate": "Apr 13, 2018", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/2347325-carol", "userReview": "Like a pebble being dropped onto the surface of a still pond and the ripples that then extend for a very long distance, this is the story of how one act reverberates in the heart for a very long period of time impacting all those within its circle. But which act is it that echoes: the husband's infidelity, the sister's betrayal, the wife's blindness to self and others? There are four husbands, three sisters, four wives, four mothers, four fathers, and five children whose stories are interwoven. The author does a very good job of pulling the reader into a very sad story. The reader continues turning the pages as the story unfolds hoping for the happily ever after ending, knowing that one aspect will not end so but hoping that moment will be a turning point. It is a turning point but not the happily ever after which in reality is a reflection, and echo, of life."}, {"userName": "Heather  Erickson", "userReviewDate": "Aug 28, 2017", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/28965215-heather-erickson", "userReview": "A Hard Book to ReviewFirst, the pros of this book:The story is excellent. I could easily see this made into a movie. It moved me to tears. It was a five star story.Now, the cons:At first, I thought it might have been the translation that was the problem. The book reads in such a stiff manner. But I think it has more to do with being written in the present tense. It's so, in your face. To make matters worse, we must continuously hear the same timeline role over and over again in each of the sisters ' voices. It is a jarring adjustment. Also, the people are not likable. Perhaps it's a cultural thing, but they are all so cold. The one exception is Henrik. This made it difficult to read. I would not this book.

The novel focuses on the lives of three Swedish sisters with very different lives and circumstances - from the stylish and controlled Astrid with a perfect family life, to dancer Sandra and businesswoman Lena. We learn more about each with different chapters written in different voices, as a family tragedy exposes secrets from the past. It is a well written book, with an interesting Swedish setting, and the characters are also well-fleshed out.

For example, each character tells their perspective of what happens at a high school graduation. This format continues thru the story. It gets a little boring. Several times I thought 'if this keeps on, I think I'll quit reading this book'. But there was a enough interest (or something) to keep reading til the end. Many of those perspectives could have been eliminated and made the story shorter and more interesting. There were times when the wrong words were used to portray the point of view.

As a daughter a sister and not a mother it evokes much in the way of confusion and clarity at the same time. I saw myself though each of the women's eyes even if I did not live this life.Strength comes not from living a lie, it comes from standing in absolute truth even when it hurts.

Her women , with all their imperfections, are so real; we know each of them intimately from the very first pages, from petty jealousy to unconditional love.
