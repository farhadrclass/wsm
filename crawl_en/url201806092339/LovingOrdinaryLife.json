As a general rule, if I am looking for self help, I go to the internet. I can be honest. And usually, I am a little disappointed. This book didn't follow that trend, because it isn't trying to be like the other self help books.It is very short. This book focuses on various aspects of life, how they reflect on us, and tries to give a few simple things that we can do to make life better. This book is more about how you look at life. Perhaps part of the reason I like it is because it discusses many of the same things that I have come to understand in my life (at its current point in time). You make yourself happy, and it is all depended on your outlook and what you do.\u00a0The publisher of this book, Identity Publications, reached out to me to review this book and a few others (whose reviews are on the way!), and I will admit I was wary. But I enjoyed this book more than I thought I would.If you are looking for a step by step book, this isn't it. If you are looking for something detailed, this isn't it.\u00a0If you are looking for something positive and uplifting, this could be a good addition to your collection.\u00a0Perhaps the hardest part of reviewing this book is how to rank it. I am giving it a 4 stars because it doesn't pretend to be something it isn't. It isn't really a self help book. It is a motivation book. A book to look to when you are wondering what to do about your state of mind. This is a book to help you reach positivity goals. It isn't to help you with a specific struggle. At the same time, it wasn't the most amazing book I have read. The biggest reason I liked it is because the author has determined many of the same things in life I have, and ended up expanding my thoughts on how to bring more to my life. We are all here for a short time, we should make it what we want it to be."}, {"userName": "Jasmine", "userReviewDate": "Nov 10, 2017", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/4536416-jasmine", "userReview": "Loving Ordinary Life is a self-help book at its core, but it's more than that. For me, it was more inspiring and realistic. There are no crazy, out-there things you should do to make yourself happy or live a better life. Loving Ordinary Life is a book for normal, everyday people who just want to find simple ways to make life more fulfilling and happy.I enjoyed the easy-going, simplistic advice of the book. It focused more on using your senses to heighten your experiences, no matter how boring or bland they may seem. Like one example was to listen to music. Open your favorite playlist and find songs that will set the mood. This is something I already do on a day-to-day basis, so seeing it written as good advice made me feel better about doing it. Sometimes I'd feel bad that I was closing myself off from people and just losing myself in music so I could de-stress and relax. But it really does help, and by doing so, I can live a better life because I'm not so stressed.Another suggestion was to immerse yourself in a hobby; something you enjoy doing but maybe feel you don't have the time for, or the talent for. Instead of ignoring it, stop and take a breather from the hustle and bustle of life. Pick up that book and read it. Take some time to search knitting tutorials on YouTube and teach yourself to create something for yourself, or even someone else. I like that advice, especially because so many people focus just on their job and ignore the things that they enjoy. The only \"negative\" thing about this book, if you will, is that there are a few pages that happen to be repeated. Like, there's advice on one page, and then the next page has the same exact advice repeated word for word. I think it may have been a publishing glitch, though, and nothing that the author did.Overall, I really liked reading through the advice in Loving Ordinary Life. It made me feel better about the things I already do to make myself happy, and it also inspired me to try new things. I give the book 4.5 stars."}, {"userName": "Heena Rathore P.", "userReviewDate": "Nov 13, 2017", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/19253213-heena-rathore-p", "userReview": "Living Ordinary Life by Anastasia Petrenko is a light-hearted self-help book which is both quick to read and easy to digest.Though the message tried to convey in this book is nothing different from the other gazillion self-help books, this book wins on the aesthetics part.

Then this might be for you. Rather than focus on experimental treatments from around the world or a surreal look at the ins and outs of the self-help world, author Anastasia Petrenko introduces readers to Loving Ordinary Life: a self help book for people who are tired of self-help books. The short and easy read is a simple guide on how to be your best self without changing yourself and learning to accept who you are in the most loving way possible. Here is the synopsis:Loving Ordinary Life is written for us: living, emotional people.We all want to live a happy life, but we can easily fall into a state of despondency. We prefer to smile, but more often we frown.We like being inspired, but most likely, we can\u2019t recall the last time when we were.There are many books and courses about self-motivation and inspiration. You might have heard hundreds of platitudes and affirmations. Each of them sounds valid but their utility is limited when you actually find yourself stuck in a pit of pain and despair.Loving Ordinary Life is meant to make a functional difference. It\u2019s not a treatment for depression. It is about living a life where depression has no place.Loving Ordinary Life is your guide. It is designed so that you can open any page and find the inspiration to act and improve your life when you\u2019re feeling down. Each chapter in Loving Ordinary Life is a tool for moving from a negative idle state to a positive proactive state. It displays to you the art of being present, free, and genuine every day.If you want to be more fulfilled and enjoy life more, if you\u2019re open to quality changes, Loving Ordinary Life will become your loyal companion.Everything is within your power. You are the master of your life. How you experience it depends only on you. Take the lead.\u201cVery little is needed to make a happy life; it is all within yourself, in your way of thinking.\"Marcus AureliusThis was a great and quick read. From start to finish you felt a sense of calm take over as you allowed yourself to absorb this book fully. It allows readers to examine their own lives and find happiness not from any external source, but rather from within themselves. Putting a stamp on the reliance of the self over the reliance of society, this book does a great job of creating an air of ease and an atmosphere of relative calm.Overall this was a wonderful book. Filled with passion, compassion and genuine care, this non self help book does a marvelous job of showing the power we all have within ourselves, and how to embrace it wholeheartedly.

Life is made of high and lows, happiness and sadness, but what is important is how we manage to bring ourselves from that down point to a floating line. And we can achieve that by getting to know ourselves better.The introduction defines so well the purpose of this book it is not intended to guide us towards complete happiness or be a manual on how to handle mental health issues. It just gives some hints on how to make our life more comfortable and learn to enjoy the beauty in all that surrounds us.Going through each chapter, I\u2019ve learned some things that I can easily apply for myself and as well advices on how to support my friends when they are at their lowest. These were some easy steps that can even be fun to implement.I must admit though that I was not very comfortable with the illustrations. While they bring color to the text, they are a bit childish and sometimes even distracting. That\u2019s my only reason not to give all my stars.To sum up, reading Anastasia Petrenko\u2019s book has inspired and encouraged me to pay more attention to what makes me happy and it really boosted my optimism.

And how do you eliminate not so positive people from your life without being considered a jerk?Many points that are brought up are skimmed over in the same manner. We all should love ourselves, appreciate our surroundings, and help others as much as possible.

The title is accurate, in that it is a self help book for those who don't enjoy other ones. However, I think it lacked in content. I felt as if he provided simple ways to help without explaining how to achieve them. I also really liked all of the quotes the book contained and how simple it was to read. Sometimes less is more when trying to help someone. But I did feel as if this needed just a bit more. I think this book would be better suited as a quote of the day or thought of the day. Almost like those calendars people put on their desks that have the word or quote of the day.

The first chapter was more of the same, but as I continued, a chapter a day (so the simple suggestions could sink in), she wore me down. The layout, with circled suggestions, very few words on each page, and cheerful illustrations by Rina Kapustina, makes the book easily digestible. Most of all, the ideas are easy to implement.
