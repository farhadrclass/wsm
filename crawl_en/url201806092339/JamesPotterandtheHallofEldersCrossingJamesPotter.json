Writers of Jane Austen fan-fiction (of which I've read a fair amount) should take notes from G. Norman Lippert. He remains respectful of both the world and characters J.K. Rowling created while adding his own elements. In my opinion, J.K. Rowling is an absolutely exquisite writer. While Lippert's writing style is not quite as flawless as J.K. Rowling's, he is definitely a good writer in his own right. I'm sure there are many people who could pick apart his interpretation of the wizarding world and the characters with whom we are all familiar. However, if you just want to be transported back to the magic of Hogwarts by an author who is definitely trying to show his respect and admiration for the orginal, this is the book for you."}, {"userName": "Dyuti", "userReviewDate": "May 10, 2012", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/5486168-dyuti", "userReview": "[As a matter of fact, in the end, things get so confused, that the new character (whom you are rooting for to hate with the same passion as you hated Voldermort) gets turned into the nice guy!

And at first, it was really pretty fun. I liked the dynamic of the James/Zane/Ralph trio, and the way a couple of the mysteries were set up early on. And the writing wasn't magical, but it wasn't bad either. Only then I felt like things kind of started to fall apart for me a little. Certain things felt...off. There seemed to be very little regard for age in this story, which was definitely a big difference between this and Rowling's books, where, if I remember correctly, students only shared rooms and classes with other students in their own year. And bringing all the Americans into the story felt awkward, since there didn't seem to be any real reason for it, other than the author wanting it to be so. And the whole Ben Franklyn thing? Beh. I got the idea that was supposed to be funny and clever, but it just seemed obnoxious to me. And then also there's something about how you have to take classes and get certified to fly on a broom now, only, if that's the case, why the heck is Hogwarts letting first years try out for Quidditch before any of them have even had one lesson in school??? Things like that just didn't seem well thought out to me.In addition, I felt like I couldn't recognize the original characters in Lippert's iterations of them--at least the ones who had grown up since Harry Potter and the Deathly Hallows, like Harry and Neville. They just felt like entirely new characters to me, completely divorced from their young adulthood selves, and I found I had no attachment to them whatsoever.Anyway, somewhere between the promising beginning and about a fourth of the way through, I realized that I was BORED. I like the idea behind this, but I just don't like the execution of it enough to continue, though I can understand why a lot of folks are really enjoying it. It's certainly fun to be back in that world, but I think I'll just stick to rereading the Harry Potter books again instead."}, {"userName": "Elaine White", "userReviewDate": "Jul 18, 2011", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/5807641-elaine-white", "userReview": "Being a massive fan of the Harry Potter books and films i loved this book. It's very like the original Harry Potter with the way the characters act and speak. It's exactly the sort of things you would expect from Harry Potter's son.It's a great kids story, just like the original Harry Potter books. You get a lot of glimpses of the Harry Potter series - mentions of past events, the Battle of Hogwarts, old characters and grudges - but much more with new characters and new circumstances. It's great to see what might have been after Harry Potter and the Deathly Hallows. You get to see what happened to Remus and Tonk's son Ted and everyone else's kids. Even though the mischief of Fred and George isn't there, Ted and his 'Gremlins' make up for the loss.The only drawback for me is that around page 100, i lost interest for a week. Lots of things were hinted at and happening, lots of classes and mischief, but nothing that explained the events at the beginning of the book enough to satisfy my curiosity and continue reading. Eventually, being one to finish what i start, i went back to it and found that after four or five pages, things really started to happen in a way that i became hooked just as badly as i had been when reading Harry Potter. I still have one or two unanswered questions, but am hopeful that they'll be explained in the next two books of the series.If you read HP 1-7, saw the films and loved them, read this! If you were like me and read Fantastic Beasts and Where to Find Them, Quidditch Through the Ages and the Harry Potter Encyclopedia then you have to read this book!"}, {"userName": "Reanne", "userReviewDate": "Sep 30, 2012", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/5508082-reanne", "userReview": "Despite how the author and his mega-fans might want to delude themselves otherwise, this is a fanfic. One of hundreds of thousands (if not far more). He did not invent fanfic. It's been around as long as storytelling. He got a lot of press when this came out because he happened to be ignorant of the existence of fanfic, the fanfic community, and fanfic tropes, and because he wanted to toot his own horn enough to make a whole website devoted to his fanfic (as opposed to simply posting it on one of the many, many fanfic archives, as most fanfic writers do). His books aren't the best fanfic I've ever read. They're not even the best James Potter-centric fanfic I've ever read. But they're not bad, as long as you can keep yourself from beating your head against a wall over his utter and insulting disregard for canon and the world he's working in. Which, believe me, is a real test of will at times. Still, as much as his attitude about fanfic and the fanfic nature of his own story irritates me, it's a decently entertaining read. As fanfic, I'd say it's good. Better than most, but not what I'd count among the best by any means. If you're really into Harry Potter and enjoy reading novel-length (or longer) stories of a G or PG rating, you might enjoy adding this one to your reading list (although if you like those sorts of stories, I'd also recommend the Teddy Lupin series by Fernwithy, as well as the one [and another in progress] Potter kids story she's written). Here are more specific comments on this story, but the following does contain a lot of spoilers:The Good \u2013-- Canon characters appear to remain in character. I would disagree with his interpretation of James Potter, but since it\u2019s a character we get only a glimpse of, it doesn\u2019t bother me too much. I actually quite like his Teddy Lupin (aside from his insistence upon calling him \u2018Ted\u2019, despite the fact that he is clearly called Teddy in the epilogue).-- The relationship between James and Harry is quite charming.-- In fact, the portrayal of Harry altogether is kind of wonderful. It\u2019s not the first time I\u2019ve noticed this, but I think I really like Harry more as an adult than as a teen. Lippert seems to capture the same sense of humor, wisdom, and modesty that I\u2019ve seen both in the actual epilogue and in other fanfic.-- The story includes both Snape (as a portrait) and Cedric (as a ghost). The scenes with Snape even treat him quite fairly.-- The student antagonist (a Slytherin, of course) is really very believable. I put this in the \u2018good\u2019 section because, from a literary standpoint, it is quite effective. Personally, I dislike this type of antagonist because it\u2019s a little too real. This character and her political machinations are all too true to life. I dislike people like this in real life, so I dislike this character quite a lot. But the fact that this character draws such a strong reaction from me shows how effective Lippert was in writing her.-- The story is actually pretty entertaining. The plot moves along fairly well (at least after the first quarter of the fic or so). There\u2019s some nice (if not amazing) humor. At least the last half of the fic kept me wanting to know what would happen next, though it took a while for me to get into it. I dislike how Lippert invents so much magic, rules, and other things without any canonical evidence, but others may not mind it.-- There is no pages-long explanation of the evil plot by the villain at the end, unlike with the actual HP books.The Bad \u2013-- The author can\u2019t seem to decide on what the title of his own book is. Within the book, the apostrophe in \u201cHall of Elders\u2019 Crossing\u201d keeps moving. At one point, it\u2019s spelled \u201cElder\u2019s Crossing\u201d and four lines later, \u201cElders\u2019 Crossing\u201d. It\u2019s as if Lippert doesn\u2019t realize those two things have completely different meanings.-- All Gryffindor boys share the same dorm. (James is shown sleeping in the same dorm room with Teddy.) This is pointed out as being different from what we know, at least, but as no explanation is given and McGonagall doesn\u2019t strike me as the type of Headmistress who would make wacky and unnecessary changes like that, I\u2019m still gonna call BS on that one.-- All years and houses have classes together. (In at least one instance, first-year James has a class with Teddy [a sixth- or seventh-year Gryffindor], a sixth-year Slytherin, and a third-year Ravenclaw.) This seems to be authorial laziness; it looks like he didn\u2019t want to be arsed to come up with more than two OCs in James\u2019s year.-- McGonagall is both Headmistress and Transfiguration professor. As far as I can tell, there\u2019s nothing at all in canon to support the idea of a person holding both positions at once, nor any need for it.-- Several electronic devices are said to be working inside Hogwarts. This is critical to the plot. Canonically, electronics simply do not work at Hogwarts. At all. It\u2019s not enough to include a throw-off comment about it not quite working as well as it normally does. -- A teacher claims that if a wizard doesn\u2019t properly focus while Disapparating, he will not Apparate (or, as the author puts it, \u2018Reapparate\u2019) at all, but will simply vanish. This is supposedly because Apparition involves the scattering of one\u2019s atoms everywhere. In canon, if someone isn\u2019t focusing properly they get splinched, they don\u2019t simply disappear and not return. This actually turns out to be a fairly important part of the story, which only makes the pulled-it-out-of-his-ass-ness of it worse.-- There are several other errors as far as the way things work in the wizarding world (floo communication, for example).The Ugly \u2013-- The author does not content himself with simply the highly overused clich\u00e9 of \u2018the American exchange student\u2019 (though he certainly includes it), he also gives us an entire cadre of Americans, including three new teachers\u2014one of whom, I kid you not, is Benjamin Franklin. Yes, the Benjamin Franklin. Except even that is made more ridiculous by the fact that he spells it Benjamin Franklyn. He\u2019s turned one of the most important and influential men in American history into a Mary Sue. Generally speaking, there is way too much Americanness going on in Hogwarts. It\u2019s like Lippert couldn\u2019t quite stretch his imagination far enough to work within the world he was given, so he felt the need to bring in lots of stuff he\u2019s more familiar with to make himself feel more comfortable.-- Lippert introduces a new class called Technomancy. Except he\u2019s apparently decided to shun the traditional definition of this word (or at least how it\u2019s been used every time I\u2019ve seen it), which is using magic to control technology (much as how necromancy is using magic to control the dead). No, he\u2019s decided that the word means something about using science to explain magic. Which is both linguistically incorrect and frankly stupid. If you can explain magic with science, it\u2019s not magic, is it? Not to mention that his explanations are flatly wrong, given what we know of this world (see the comment on Apparition above)."}, {"userName": "Caro", "userReviewDate": "Sep 11, 2012", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/9133439-caro", "userReview": "[Also who didn't see Ralph's wand being the staff the MOMENT THE THREE RELICS OF MERLIN WERE EVEN MENTIONED?!

Mr Grey, Mr Pink... I don't get it. I was lost after a few pages and couldn't be bothered to wade through the rest. I don't normally give negative reviews because the effort of writing is such a hugely enviable one, I like to encourage it, but here are some points for improvement which I hope the author takes on board. I get that this is Potter fan fiction, but I just don't get the Scorsese references. If you build a fantasy world, don't fill it with gangster stereotypes. I thought that Mr Grey was going to be a 50 Shade reference, so I was at least happy it wasn't but you need a new bunch of names and probably totally re-write the prologue. The dialect is too heavy. I get it... 'They can't talk propper, like wot we dunn', but that doesn't mean you need to rub my nose in the fact. The setting has not been laid out prior to the action. I don't really know where I am when everything starts. It's not been described at all really, and the images in my head are worse than dull...

Honestly, I can say that it is different from, but just as good as, the Harry Potter novels written by J. K. Rowling. It was well-written with new and likable characters and the format of the book was the same. It covers Harry\u2019s son James\u2019 first year at Hogwarts and his adventures with his friends Zane and Ralph. The adventure in this book is a little similar to the Deathly Hallows with the gathering of three relics, but it is totally unique as well. This book some how managed to compliment and expand upon the endlessly interesting world of Harry Potter. Also, the length of the book was what first made me take it seriously. It isn\u2019t huge, but it is longer in word count than the Half-Blood Prince and the following two are even longer. I haven\u2019t read the other two yet but I definitely will. In fact, writing this review is taking away from the time I should be spending on the reading. Lippert has rekindled that overwhelming feeling of curiosity that I had when waiting for the next Harry Potter novel. I am surprised that more people haven\u2019t read these yet. I recommend this book and the following two (even though I haven\u2019t gotten to them yet) to anyone who has read the seven Harry Potter novels.Again, all I can say is that I am impressed."}, {"userName": "Rebecca McNutt", "userReviewDate": "Jan 01, 2017", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/36977686-rebecca-mcnutt", "userReview": "Can't you write your own stories instead of piggybacking on famous published novels that other authors wrote???

I wouldn't have paid for it (I know there's another pay copy of a spin off of this fan fiction).I have nothing against fan fiction. My own has taught me so much about writing in general that I will always have a soft spot for the concept. But I would never dream of making money off my fan fics, and that's probably the first problem that I have with this fan fic. Especially as it has led to court cases on copyright infringement.But also, too much was altered in the canon. And what was altered didn't even make sense for the storyline - Merlin is feared the whole novel and yet when he's resurrected/changed the laws of apparition to return to hogwarts he's a stern yet jovial character. As a other reviewer has said, it's a little coincidental that all three elements were brought together just at the right time.There's more I dislike, I could tell early on that this was written by an American, not a British person, by the romantic way they view England. We don't talk like that, school - even boarding school - is not like this novel is presented. The reason the original Harry Potters work so well is that J.K.Rowling was so immersed in our history, in our society, that such notions came easily. I know from friends in America that it's not uncommon for people in different grades to go to the same classes. This doesn't happen in England yet in the novel it appears to? I know I sound like I'm nitpicking, but all these little things add up.The muggle who somehow penetrates magic boundaries makes no sense - was he a squib and this information glazed over?

Lippert\u2019s website threw me off right away, on two different points. First of all, he asserts that when he sat down to write his Potter fanfiction, he had never heard of the term \u201cfanfiction.\u201d I doubt that anyone with much experience of the Internet, even the Internet of three years ago, could imagine that they were \u2018alone\u2019 in anything, including the obviously huge Harry Potter fandom. Regardless, once he *had* written his fanfiction, the idea that he didn\u2019t take the time to look for more of it on the Internet before making his website and putting out his novel is also fairly ridiculous, and leads one to believe that Lippert constructed the website and faux-na\u00efvet\u00e9 to gain attention. Lippert will certainly always protest that this is untrue, and as it likely impossible to \u2018prove\u2019 his intentions either way, I\u2019ll set this argument aside. To put it simply, Lippert published a piece of fanfiction from outside of the fanfiction community, and whether that is a positive, negative or neutral attribute is for the reader to decide.The second issue that disturbed me is the dismissive attitude that Lippert takes toward a certain section of his readers, whom he dubs the \u201cCanon Police.\u201d He admits to some faults, then claims \u201cI was usually glad for the notes of correction, although I was dismayed at the ones that were accompanied by the verbal equivalent of Howlers about my abysmal writing, occasionally adding that I had \u2018ruined Harry Potter.\u2019\u201d Frankly, if you were glad for the notes of correction, you wouldn\u2019t complain about the readers who offered them. The downside to Lippert having come from outside of the fanfiction community is either, politely, that he had no beta reader to help him fix these errors, or, rudely, that he had no idea anyone would bother to criticize him and couldn\u2019t handle it when someone did. For me, it is a personal pet peeve when any author criticizes his or her readers. In a professional author, it is as disgusting as criticizing one\u2019s customers, and ensures that they won\u2019t come back for another product. In a fanfiction author, it\u2019s just petty. Furthermore, when writing fanfiction, an author has to deal with the fact that he or she is playing in someone else\u2019s sandbox. No pooping, no throwing sand, and no smashing the castles that the owner of the sandbox has built. Fans of a work who are seeking out fanfiction to read are bound to be the most devoted type of fans, the ones who care deeply about the characters, and who are hurt to see their conception of the characters misrepresented. This is why people get so crazy about their \u201cOTPs,\u201d and why Potter fans will find various problems with Lippert\u2019s book.Some of Lippert\u2019s errors were annoying, and some failed basic logic tests. For example, he has Zane and James taking a Technomancy class (kind-of like magic crossed with Physics, and it is interesting at times, especially when Lippert considers how apparition occurs, but at other times, again, annoyingly wrong) with a boy called Murdock, who is old enough to apparate. Of course, that means that Murdock is seventeen. How often do 17-year-olds and 11-year-olds take classes together in the real world? Rarely, because as humans, one\u2019s brain is at a very different developmental stage at 11 than it is at 17. School is divided into grades partly to help put in order the process of learning, to show the learner the steps that are taken to understand a concept. It\u2019s hard to take Physics if you can\u2019t do algebra, for example. Similarly, there is a stigma on students who \u201cskip\u201d or \u201cfail\u201d years of school. Lippert has forgotten these basic rules of humanity in several places, including other classes. His Gryffindors share bedrooms with students of various ages and seem to have many more cross-year friendships than do Rowling\u2019s wizards (though I did often find it unbelievable when Harry didn\u2019t know the name of an older student from his own house, like Cormac McLaggen). He also has students taking classes as first-year students that didn\u2019t begin, in Harry\u2019s time, until third year (Ralph takes Arithmancy, if I recall correctly).Quidditch takes place on a school day in Lippet\u2019s book, even though in the canon it\u2019s always on a Saturday morning. Again, a little common sense might have averted this one: teenagers today play sports on weekday afternoons, but they don\u2019t go to boarding schools where they\u2019re locked up together all weekend anyway. Any good teacher knows that game days are the worst days to teach class, as all of the athletes are distracted (or worse, dismissed early) and the rest of the kids are nearly as wiggly and ready to leave. Even if Lippert forgot the canon, he ought to have considered the effect of scheduling a game on a weekday, and for the educational benefit of the imaginary students, shifted the game to the weekend.Finally, Lippert makes a big hullaballoo about magical art in Technomancy class, asserting that imaginary characters can move into other pictures, including portraits of real people, but the subjects of portraits cannot move to any other pictures save other instances of their own portrait. This is a major plot point, as James eventually discovers that Snape has painted small, disguised portraits of himself into the backgrounds of paintings around the castle, so that he can observe from multiple viewpoints. Oh, and Snape doodled similar portraits into his old Potions book, even though that\u2019s never mentioned in \u201cHarry Potter and the Half-Blood Prince,\u201d either. Lippert went to a bunch of trouble to have a teacher teach something that was plainly wrong. In at least two places in the canon, it is made clear that the subjects of portraits can travel to visit their portraits in other buildings, *and* can travel into the other pictures hung around them in a single building. It happens in \u201cHarry Potter and the Order of the Phoenix,\u201d when Everard, a former headmaster, goes to visit his other portrait in the Ministry of Magic, and says that, while in the Ministry of Magic, he \u201cran along to Elfrida Cragg\u2019s portrait to get a good view as they left.\u201d It happens again in \u201cHarry Potter and the Deathly Hallows,\u201d when Harry goes to Dumbledore\u2019s office and uses the Penseive to see Snape\u2019s thoughts. The office is changed because, \u201cThe portraits that hung all around the walls were empty. Not a single headmaster or headmistress remained to see him. All, it seemed, had flitted away, charging through the paintings that lined the castle so that they could have a clear view of what was going on.\u201d (Please forgive any slight misquotations, as I have only the audiobooks to go on at the moment.) Had Lippert simply gone back to check what canon had to say on the matter of portraits, he would have found the two instances I mention, and wouldn\u2019t have needed to go to the trouble of having Snape paint himself all over the castle, an action that seems highly out of character. Snape never shows artistic interests during any of the books. Furthermore, and this bit is more open to interpretation, I don\u2019t think he would have *bothered* to do so during his lifetime. Either way, it simply wasn\u2019t necessary: Lippert could have had Snape darting all over the castle in disguise on his own. To what extent a reader is willing to set aside these incongruities in a piece of fanfiction is up to the individual reader. They bothered me quite a bit, but, then again, I listen to the Harry Potter audiobooks as background noise all the time, and have subsequently absorbed a lot of information into my subconscious (for example, I remembered those two instances of portrait-travel without looking them up, though I did have to check for the exact quotations). However, if a reader criticizes only the errors, he or she falls into Lippert\u2019s trap of being \u201cCanon Police,\u201d and is thereby dismissed. Again, as I said, I think that canon errors are a legitimate issue, but having described them, I\u2019ll set them aside and look at the book on its own merits.\u201cJames Potter and the Hall of Elders\u2019 Crossing\u201d also struggles as a book on its own. There is, essentially, \u2018too much\u2019 going on, making each sub-plot seem less wholly relevant. There are a few different strands of events, which I feel fall into three categories. One category is just \u201cthe presence of Americans.\u201d Lippert has three teachers and several students from the American school of \u201cAlma Aleron\u201d show up for \u201ca year-long international magical summit.\u201d Or, no good reason at all. And one of the teachers is Ben Franklyn. That one. But he spelled his name differently for the Muggles. On one hand, this argument could easily be dismissed by the anti-Canon-police as being too centered on Rowling\u2019s conception of Hogwarts. Again, though, I think logic is against this as well. Students in college, or sometimes high school, do sometimes study abroad for a year. Teachers do, sometimes, go teach for a year in a different school. Even canon has students visiting in order to participate in the Triwizard Cup. The reason I struggled with the presence of Americans is that there wasn\u2019t a unifying reason for them to be there. It did give Lippert a reason to add a \u201cTechnomancy\u201d teacher, but otherwise, it wasn\u2019t clear what the other teachers and students were really doing at Hogwarts. They felt incongruous.The other two strands form the two different antagonistic forces faced by James. On the one hand, there are the \u201cProgressive Element\u201d students, who believe that Voldemort wasn\u2019t evil, and that the Wizarding community is discriminating against Muggles by assuming that they can\u2019t handle knowing about the existence of wizards. It\u2019s an interesting conception, and certainly the idea of arguing over historical interpretation has its appeal. At the same time, there are forces working to recall Merlinus Ambrosius, the legendary \u201cMerlin\u201d of wizard exclamations and human mythology. In order to recall Merlin, one must gather his three relics and put them in a specific place during a specific astronomical event. In the book, this is connected to the Progressive Element, as those attempting to recall Merlin are Progressives who want Merlin to lead their revelations to the Muggle world. However, the two antagonistic strands fight against each other rather than being complementary, and each has a sort-of separate climax. The Progressive Element succeeds in leading a Muggle newscaster into Hogwarts, and the Merlin-recalling Progressive Element succeeds in recalling Merlin. Each event is more than enough climax for one book, but Lippert crams both into his story, diminishing the importance of each. The way that the Hogwarts staff deals with the Muggle newscaster is charming, but it didn\u2019t require Merlin\u2019s participation. Similarly, Merlin is a somewhat interesting character, obviously a Dumbledore analog, but with enough differences to make him potentially intriguing. However, his presence wasn\u2019t really necessary to pull off the Muggle distraction, and summoning him could have had other consequences than pulling off the Muggle distraction. In my opinion, a more condensed story with only one of these antagonistic strands would have been great. Indeed, Lippert could have focused on the Muggle newscaster, while still dropping hints about the recall of Merlin, and set himself up tidily for the next book. I\u2019ll forgive Lippert for borrowing Merlin, as he does tangentially show up in the canon (Merlin\u2019s pants!), but now that he\u2019s stuffed both threads into one story, I\u2019m not really sure where his next book can possibly go. The Harry Potter series is created with an end in mind: to defeat Voldemort. James Potter doesn\u2019t have his own villain; the Progressive Element is shaping up to be interesting, but that\u2019s a battle of the minds rather than a battle of men, so it isn\u2019t clear how Lippert will drive the plot for the next books (he\u2019s already written two more).Rowling\u2019s writing style was never the strong point of the Harry Potter books; she can be repetitive with her adjectives, for example. Lippert\u2019s writing style doesn\u2019t stand out particularly, which, for a children\u2019s book, is an advantage. Eleven-year-olds are just barely beginning to understand \u201cstyle,\u201d so to have an overly unique one would not be beneficial. The few poems and songs he has included are awful, lacking an even meter (though I guess that the Gryffindor Quidditch song could be awful on purpose, as it was written by teenagers? A stretch). Most of the characters are relatively flat, but consistent (save for the canon characters, -would McGonagall really reduce her teaching load just to go on dates with a Muggle policeman?- but that\u2019s a separate issue). Several moments in the book are rather funny, such as when Zane makes a James Bond joke, or when James encounters the Fat Lady for the first time, and doesn\u2019t know the password.Most of the times when I had difficulty relate to a combination of characterization and plot: the story has so many new characters, as well as most of the old ones, so it can be hard to remember details about any given person, or care. Ted seemed to be spending most of his time with a Hermione-ish brainy character, Petra, only to be spotted holding hands with Victoire, who lacked characteristics beyond \u201cpretty\u201d and \u201cpretty snotty,\u201d at the end of the book. Indeed, though Lippert makes the Draco-ish Slytherin villain a girl, Tabitha Corsica, he doesn\u2019t spend much time at all considering the female characters. James\u2019 \u201ctrio\u201d includes Ralph and Zane (both Muggle-born, and Zane an American as well), and though they encounter some other girls (mainly Petra), there isn\u2019t a sympathetic female student who gets more than a passing treatment. Granted, the Hermione of \u201cHarry Potter and the Sorcerer\u2019s Stone\u201d wasn\u2019t a hugely likeable character, either, but at least we got to see lots of her. Connected to this issue, Lippert fails to tie up his loose ends. James gets advice from Snape\u2019s portrait, but never goes back to see him again. Tabitha acts as a Progressive Element mouthpiece in a debate, and suffers an attempted broom-theft halfway through the book, but she never reappears to be angry that the Muggle newsman was thwarted, or to hassle James on the train (though she is much milder than Draco, I admit). Again, this lack of thoroughness comes from the fact that too much is going on; with one antagonistic plot at a time, readers might come to know the characters better.Overall, \u201cJames Potter and the Hall of Elders\u2019 Crossing\u201d has one very serious thing going for it: it\u2019s a novel-length fanfiction that is already complete. Though there are many fanfiction writers, and good ones, complete novel-length works are thin on the ground. I\u2019d love to say that I disliked Lippert\u2019s first work enough to not read his second and third, but that\u2019s a lie. I didn\u2019t like the first James Potter book, but I\u2019ll probably read the rest simply because they\u2019re there, and I love the world of Hogwarts enough to go back as often as possible, even if I\u2019m only going to an erroneous imitation of the place. In that way, perhaps, Lippert can serve the community: by inspiring those who are capable of doing better to get off their butts and do it!"}, {"userName": "Gergana", "userReviewDate": "Jan 20, 2016", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/5312798-gergana", "userReview": "DNF: 20% Read in January 27 till 28, 2016This book is absolutely amazing! 1. The style - very similar to miss Rowling's, 2. the magical world and Hogwarts - wonderfully described, yet enough of new elements are introduced to satisfy your needs, 3. the three main characters - feel like part of Miss Rowling's world, yet, they are different from the original cast. Love that James doesn't like living in his father's shadow and that he wants to be different.4. new twists, the story takes on a completely different approach with having James being the only non-muggle born in his group and having his best friends assigned to different houses from him. 5. A great sequel to the events of the original series - you can see how the school was affected, especially the Slytherin house.6. And ~~ by this time you're probably wondering -if this book is so freaking awesome, why the hell did I stop at 20%?Well...ok, there were quite a few things that irritated me and I've already listed them in the comments of my status updates. But were they so bad to make me want to discontinue the book - no. In fact, I recommend this book to anyone who is desperate for more Hogwarts experience!However, bare in mind that James Potter feels so much like an ACTUAL SEQUEL that your mind might start considering it as cannon. Is this a bad thing? Depends on the type of person you are. I am the type of person who remembers too much.Basically, Mr. Lippert takes the Harry Potter universe to the next level, which is great, but would also mean that if I continue reading, this knowledge of what happens with Hogwarts will remain with me every time I reread the original 7 books and I don't want that.It's like seeing one of your favorite series wrap up and you feel sad, yet satisfied. Then a new set of books serving as sequels are announced and you're ecstatic! Yet, the books change the world/characters/stuff you grew to love so much that you kind of wish you could erase them from your memory, because now you'll never see the original books the same way.

While The Deathly Hallows gave me closure, the Cursed Child ripped it apart. I read James Potter to replace these horrifying memories with something promising.What I liked :1 James Potter From the start he tries to assert himself as an individual. He comes up with different ways to achieve this goal, which lets you connect with him. He was not a miniature version of The Boy Who Lived but a young boy with his own personal demons & dreams. 2 Ralph and ZaneEven as friends, they had a complicated dynamic. They didn't belong to the same houses and had different traits. 3 The Law of SecrecyThis has been repeated in every HP book and this story questioned why it was necessary. What are the consequenes if this Law is not in effect.4 Paintings with moving subjects5 Slytherin We meet a rival who is composed, intelligent and effective. Its easy to dismiss someone repeating archaic beliefs and prejudice but its impossible to ignore someone who makes you question what you believed was true.6 Harry Potter This is how Harry Potter grew up in my imagination. He was wise but not preachy, daring, modest with a sense of humour. He was a good parent who encouraged independence and individuality.7 Ted Lupin He has to be the most well adjusted character in this series. He was layered, funny, smart & adventurous. He knew the expectations of living with a legacy and was coping rather well. I hope we see more of him in the other books. Fans of Fred & George will love Ted and the Gremlins.Differences that didn't bother me : 1 Slight American Influence This didn't really bother me, I think the HP world has always represented differences. Think goblins and house elves, the Weasleys and the Malfoys or Durmstrang and Beauxbatons. I like the idea of adding something new, it could be Irish warlocks, Romanian dragons and villains, Alaskan Goblins....2 Less magicalThe dark and fascinating factor was lower in this book, it was less magical somehow. But the author is a good storyteller, I was invested in most characters and the emotional development was convincing.What I didn't like :1 Length and speed The story rambles at times, loses its pace and you're jerked out of the story.2 Ben Franklyn Even if he was not a part of the book, the story remains unchanged. Why was he there? 3 The Relics Their coming together seemed too convenient and forced. 4 Dark Super Villain I kept waiting for one but there were no villains who leave an impression. Someone you can hate, fear and plot against...I'm still waiting and hope we see someone super evil in the next book.Would I say this was a continuation of the Harry Potter world? No.We have lived, enjoyed and explored that journey to a satisfying end.But this is definitely a promising Spin Off series with a fascinating protagonist, i.e. James Potter."}, {"userName": "Leonor (Ner)", "userReviewDate": "Aug 26, 2011", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/3648579-leonor-ner", "userReview": "Also published in \"A Cup of Coffee and a Book\"I am not giving this 4 stars just because this isn't J.K. Rowling's official work.This was a very pleasant reading. Normally I'm sceptical about fan-fictions concerning a saga I absolutely worship. However, this was recommended to me by another \"Harry Potter\" fan so I've decided to give it a go. Also, the idea of having some sort of continuation after \"Deathly Hallows\", made me grab this story and read it, forgetting it wasn't written by the genius herself.This \"book\" - since it's not a true publication but an on-line reading - manages to create a plausible continuation for Harry Potter saga, this time being his son James the main character. It's a Potter, still. The characters were created in a way that resembled the previous characters, being Ted Lupin my ultimate favourite one. That particular character reminded me of the Weasley twins, which was amazing since I kind of miss them. Ralph and Zane were a mixture of Ron/Hermione/Luna and Neville, in my opinion, bringing the same comic relief as them and the true bond of friendship. As for James, to me he was a new version of his father, perhaps a little bit more mature than his father in his first year. Of course that having Harry Potter as your dad helps you viewing the world differently. Cedric surprised me since I was not expecting him to be a ghost wandering Hogwarts, completely lost and speechless. I admire the fact he was kind of connected with Snape in helping James and his friends. And I also thought about him as the new Gryffindor ghost, forgetting as James that he wasn't a Gryffindor at all.The idea of the American delegation was very well explored. I admit never having thought of that while reading Rowling's work, but Lippert managed to pick something completely different from what we were excepting, and transform it into a plausible (sorry the repetition of words) plot that would make us - my opinion of course - forget that we are not reading Rowling. Also, the Merlin plot was one of the reason it caught my attention. One great wizard as Merlin coming back from the \"dead\" and ruling was something I just needed to know how it would end. Truth be told that I never expected Merlin to be considered as the new Headmaster.The writing was extremely well planned and carefully written. There were moments I forgot, as I've mentioned, that I wasn't reading J.K. Rowling since the author really did tried his best to keep as faithful as he could to the original writing. Even the jokes sounded as something the genius herself could write. For that, good work.Overall, I think this was a very well written story based on Harry Potter, a pleasant reading that, not being official, will definitely fill your imagination as a possible continuation of the saga."}, {"userName": "Pam Marin", "userReviewDate": "Mar 10, 2012", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/7774264-pam-marin", "userReview": "This was almost as good as the original series.

I was as big a Harry Potter fan as anyone, but I never read fanfic before, because I just didn't think it felt right, I didn't want to get my \"journey\" messed up with many different fictional universes - many with dubious quality, to put it nicely. So this was my first fanfic experience. I'm in a very foreign country, learning a very foreign language and reading about complicated and war-ridden history and politics, and yesterday I really needed a break from all the psycho-ness of reality. James Potter and the Hall of Elders' Crossing provided that much-needed break, and I am grateful for it. I knew I had to let go of J.K. Rowling's Hogwarts and dive into someone else's Hogwarts, which was a little difficult, I admit, but ok - either you do it, or you just don't read the book. I liked going back to Hogwarts, even if this Hogwarts was a different one, with different characters (also the \"old\" characters like McGonnagall, Snape-in-portrait and even Harry himself were different characters, since they're written by another author), different storytelling, different style. It's ok. I found James' struggle with standing in his fathers' shadow a funny parallell to author Lippert's actual situation - no matter how well (or not) he writes, he will be in author Rowling's shadow. And as James Potter thinks, that he must be a different kind of hero from his father, Lippert must be a different sort of Hogwarts creator from Rowling. Maybe this wasn't intentional, but it was impossible to not think of it. All in all: If you can let Rowling's Hogwarts go and just dive into another person's Hogwarts, there will be no problem with reading this book, it'll be just like any other book, some will like it and some will not. After all, even if Hogwarts and the Potterverse is the creation and property of Rowling, the idea of the Potterverse belongs to everyone who has ever visited. That a place and a fictional universe can be re-visited by others, I think is ultimately a very good thing. Don't expect it to be like the original, because it will never be. All in all, I found it interesting to experience fanfic. While reading, I wondered why the author kept writing something he would have to publish for free - writing a book is a lot of work, and rarely pays off, but here, it'll be impossible for all future to make as much as a dime off it - instead of developing his own fictional universe that he can actually make some money from. At the end, I saw that he has done that too. I hope he'll have luck with that.

It was definitely well written, and had a very similar tone and voice as the original Harry Potter series. The characters and the happenings all felt genuine. But there were a few scenes I just didn't take to - some new creatures and magical practices didn't quite feel at home in Rowling's universe, and some scenes were very talky and harder to get through so that I felt like reading was a chore at times. I was able to predict a lot of things that happened toward the end of the story way beforehand, although one thing did catch me off guard and it was really cool. But, predictability always knocks off a point for me. However, I do think this story is worth a shot for any Harry Potter fan, and I will continue reading this series by Lippert.

But unfortunately, as soon as I got into chapter one, it fell completely flat.  The writing itself was fine, the characters were fine, the continuation of the last scene front he real books was fine. But... Something wasn't right. I wondered to myself what, exactly, felt wrong with the book. And then I realized: it was so AMERICAN. The Harry Potter books are essentially very British, and that's something I absolutely loved about them. From adding American characters, to the language and I think even the style of writing, I knew an American had written it even before I checked and proved myself correct.  Now, PLEASE do not get me wrong. I really enjoy many American writers. This author is a good writer, I do not contest to that. However, for this specific fan fic, someone immersed or fluent in British culture would have been able to better hold onto that realistic and authentic verve that the HP books seemed to be so full of.  I really couldn't get past chapter one, because every true HP character that was mentioned was really not doing or saying things that I felt were true to themselves. HARRY POTTER WOULD NEVER MAKE HIS SON HAVE AN OWL SIMPLY BECAUSE HE HAD ONE. You can see his true parenting style in the \"nineteen years later\" epilogue, which clearly portrays him to be a very patient, encouraging, and motivating father. It would have made so much more sense to me if James had just said that he had an owl so he could write to his family easier that having to borrow a school owl.  Reading some of the other reviews, I can interpret two things that would NEVER happen at Hogwarts: A) a muggle got into Hogwarts B) technology was used at HogwartsAs I said before, I couldn't finish reading the story myself (as of yet, I may find that my curiosity gets to me one day), and so I cannot say with uttermost conviction that I know exactly what happened, etc. but I mean... REALLY? Hogwarts is the safest place on earth, mostly due to the zillions of charms surrounding it. Muffles cannot even SEE it, comprehend it, etc, so no way ever could one get inside. As for the technology thing goes.... I mean, J.K. Never even put guns in the thick of the final Hogwarts battle. Why, oh why, would they have any sort of technology at Hogwarts? It's just one other thing that is not in line with the books. All in all, the idea is obviously fantastic. The execution is questionable.

I loved the fact that the three protagonists were not only just boys, but also boys from different houses. It expanded the range of movement of the characters in a very interesting way, and at the end, it was not just to be diverse, but downright purposeful.I had three favorite moments. When the ghost of Cedric Diggory talked to James Potter through the inscription on the Triwizard Cup, it was an eerie moment masterfully displayed, and I give big kudos to Mr. Lippert for that.I loved the part of Old Mrs. Black distracted by TV. Superb touch to quiet her outbursts.And when Merlin gave a chunk of his staff to the son of the squib, my eyes watered.

But there were a lot of weird little incongruities that kept bugging me. In relation to the thing I just mentioned, yes, it's all well and good to talk about it, but when the Muggle-borns go on and on and on about it, it gets a bit old.I thought the whole Americans coming to Hogwarts was weird. I mean, it would've been fine to have them visit, but to have them teach while they were there was weird. Madam Maxine and Karkaroff didn't teach, for instance, when they were visiting for Goblet of Fire. I also really did not like the way Lippert tried to ground everything in science, and explain how magic is all explainable by quantum physics. While I enjoy quantum physics, I found his discussions on it boring - not to mention grounding everything in science sort of ruins a lot of the fun, whimsy and, in his hands, the point of magic.But I think, even worse, were the little touches that threw me off - first years and fifth years sharing not only dorm rooms, but also taking the same classes? Quidditch on a weekday?I suppose I would be one of the people that Lippert refers to as \"the Canon Police\". Well, to him I say that perhaps if his writing and characters were more engaging I could get past the jarring quality of these things, but it's not and I couldn't.Perhaps I shall pick this up again and give it another go. I freely admit that I didn't get very far, and the real meat of the story hasn't started yet, so maybe it gets better.

Al principio me cost\u00f3 trabajo iniciarlo, pero en la medida que iba avanzando en la lectura me empec\u00e9 a sumergir en la absorbente trama y me costaba trabajo dejar de leerlo.Es un libro que respeta puntualmente el estilo de J. K. Rowling, pero que le da su propio toque. Si bien pueden criticarse algunas peque\u00f1as libertades, muchas de estas reciben una explicaci\u00f3n que encaja dentro de la l\u00f3gica del mundo rowligniano. Al fin de cuentas en ese universo ya nada podr\u00eda seguir siendo igual luego de los terribles acontecimientos que la misma autora narrara en los dos \u00faltimos tomos de la serie.La trama es muy entretenida y apasionante; abundan esos aspectos a los que ya nos hab\u00edamos acostumbrado: el misterio, el humor, la ternura, las dudas, los temores y la necesidad de tomar decisiones que nos agobian a cualquier edad; los personajes nuevos son excelentes, y ni que decir que unos cuantos reencuentros que agitan esas fibras del coraz\u00f3n que destinamos para aquellos recuerdos especiales.El autor dice en su carta final que ... la persona m\u00e1s creativa es la que mejor esconde sus fuentes... , sin embargo descartando las fuentes obvias como son Rowling y C.

Lewis, hasta que le\u00ed la carta descubr\u00ed la influencia de Terry Pratchett, pero esta tan sutilmente inmersa esa influencia en el libro que, al menos en mi caso, hasta que no lo menciona el autor no ca\u00ed en la cuenta."}], "description": "What\u2019s it like to be the son of the most famous wizard of all time?James Potter thinks he knows, but as he begins his own adventure at Hogwarts, he discovers just how much of a challenge it really is to live up to the legend of the great Harry Potter.
