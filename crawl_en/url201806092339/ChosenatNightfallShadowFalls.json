But after what C. C. Hunter did, she was obviously trying to find a way to get rid of Derek. It was lame, and I definitely expected better. They had a fucking chat and BAM, that was the end. SERIOUSLY? Obviously she just liked Lucas more and was tired of Derek. By 1/4 into the book, I realized Derek just wasn't gonna happen. And he'd changed too. Lucas started having the characteristics I loved in Derek. So that was probably bad plot writing from the author, butttt, I DON'T CARE CAUSE AT THE END I SHIPPED LUKYLIE (I made that up right now) WITH ALL MY SOUL. THEY WERE ADORABLE AT THE END. I got over Derek really quickly, THOUGH I STILL LOVE HIM. And he got his new girlfriend or whatever. And I do have another complaint, THAT ENDING WAS TINY. I WANTED A BIG BAMMM. LIKE YOU ENDED THE BOOK ALL STUNNED. Instead, I was like, AWWWW BURNETT AND HOLIDAY AKA MY LIFE. And KYLIE AND LUCAS ASLJDHSJDJGKFDVKBJLFK. But that was it!

And then he said he felt better. Yup, Lucas. But still that had to be the one thing that irritated me, that she continued not to accept him the whole damn book. In her mind what he did was unforgivable, so bad that he could never be forgiven. I don't see it, I think when someone loves you that much no matter what you say deserves a second chance.

Yes, I know, I'm being generous but I'm in a giving mood. Free sweets for everyone!Random thoughtsNote: Some points may be repetitive, incoherent and grammatically incorrect. Just because.-Kylie melodramatically ran away from Shadow Falls (a camp/supernatural school of some sort) after finding out her dirty-cheating-scumbag-werewolf boyfriend (Lucas aka WankerDickDieInHellBastard) cheated on her and got engaged to another girl. It was all very angsty and dramatic in that lame teen way.-Kylie stayed with her long lost granddad who was teaching her the chameleon way or some shit (Kylie is a supernatural chameleon\u2026 No, she's not a lizard. She can just turn into any supernatural creature \u2014 vampire/fae/werewolf etc). Oh and Kylie has about fifty different grandparents and a dozen or so parents \u2014 it's all rather ridiculous.-I was disappointed that Kylie's melodramatic exit turned out to be pointless and silly because she ended up going back to Shadow Falls after a mere 13 days\u2026 If you're going to run away melodramatically, at least do it longer than 13 wankering days!! I personally recommend 6 weeks.-Anyway, Why does Kylie go back to Shadow Falls? Because she gets attacked by the bad guy aka her arch nemesis aka Mario. Yes, the bad guy's name is Mario. And yes, I was laughing every time Mario's name cropped up because for the life of me, I just couldn't believe in a bad guy called Mario. -I would have liked if Kylie had stayed with her granddad/the chameleons instead of going to back to Shadow Falls because life there seemed far more interesting \u2014 it was creepy in its isolation and it was somewhat chilling how controlling the elders were. It was a bit like a cult... And cults are cool (to read about anyway). It would have been fascinating if the cult-like chameleon life was explored more. It's a shame, Kylie went back to the dull-uninspired-cliched Shadow Falls.-Kylie was still the same old judgy-self-pitying-whiny-woe-is-me-doormat-Mary-Sue heroine. Oh and she was also a Speshul Snowflake. Not only was she a chameleon (a rare unheard of supernatural), but she was also a Protector (an even rarer supernatural that has a calling to protect people)\u2026 And it didn't stop there, we also found out she was a Holy Warrior (a legendary supernatural warrior)\u2026 ARE YOU FUCKING KIDDING ME WITH THIS SHIT?! She was already a Speshul Snowflake of the highest order. So why make her into an even more of Speshul Snowflake?! Maybe CC Hunter wrote it that way to try to cover up how boring and shit her heroine was. Well, it didn't work on me - Kylie was still as fascinating as a plank of wood sitting on top of another plank of wood. -Lucas was the same old cheating-lying-sexist-unattractive-domineering-disgusting-loser. He cheated on Kylie once and I have no doubt that when he weds Kylie and impregnates her at eighteen, he'll be fucking some other girl.-Lucas is one of those love interests that are good with their words, and are good at making grand declarations yet fail to follow through. None of Lucas's bullshit about loving/respecting Kylie rang true because of all his previous actions and behaviour. -I didn't for a second believe Lucas's claims that he had loved Kylie + known she was his soulmate since meeting her at age 7\u2026 Because if that was the case then why did he sleep with Fredricka? And then get engaged with a different werewolf girl (Monique)? And then have make out sessions with Monique? And then pledge his soul and undying love to Monique? Why? Because he's a liar and a cheater. And he'll carry on lying and cheating. Don't worry, Kylie has no self-respect so she'll be a-okay with him treating her like shit, she's the type of person that likes being used and abused.-I bet if Kylie hadn't caught Lucas getting engaged he would have gone through with his marriage to Monique, and he would have had sex and a full on romantic relationship with her. He'd never have told Kylie, instead he would have just pretended everything was alright between them. The dick.-I thought it was rich that Lucas kept moaning about Kylie keeping secrets when he lied for weeks and weeks about Monique and his engagement. Hypocrite, thy name is Lucas.-Also, Lucas was violent towards Kylie. He grabbed Kylie's arms so hard that he left bruises. Don't you just love it when the hero bruises the heroine because he's mad? Yep, I know\u2026 you're trying not swoon, right?-Oh and Lucas using his rapey abilities to seduce Kylie into forgiving him was DISGUSTING. Ugh.-I got sick of everyone telling Kylie that Lucas was a nice guy and that he loved her and that she should forgive him. Bullshit. If Lucas was a nice guy he wouldn't have cheated, lied and betrayed the girl he supposedly loved. It was like the author couldn't be bothered having Kylie work things out on her own\u2026 Instead she had to have everyone push her, and force her into reconciling with that cheating rapey dirtbag.-Was it meant to be sweet that Lucas got Kylie an engagement/promise ring at age 16?? Ha! It wasn't. Especially when 1. He only recently got engaged to Monique behind her back and 2. He just had an engagement ceremony where he was all over Monique, and pledged his soul and love to her\u2026 So yea his engagement/promise to Kylie came across as meaningless and false. If he could pretend to be in love with Monique, then he could do the same to Kylie.-Derek was pathetic and his romantic arc was ridiculous. One minute he was in love with Kylie and the next he was over her after one not-so-profound-or-enlightening conversation, and then he moved onto Jenny. It was ridiculous. It just made Derek seem fickle and it made his love seem shallow, transient and easily replaceable. Poor Jenny, having to have Kylie's sloppy seconds and being the rebound girl/second choice.-I loved Holiday and Burnett\u2026 But I found the relationship they had with their students weird. The hugging and the whole telling Kylie that they loved her \u2014 what sort of teachers are like that with their students? And even Kylie was talking about her love for her teachers. WTF?! It was weird, it wasn't like they were related to each her or that they'd known each other a long time. I don't get why were they so close to one other. The student/teacher hugging and exchanging of I love you's was inappropriate, creepy and cringey. -About a third of the way through there was a whole lecture on sex. It was nauseating - I don't want to read the author's thoughts on sex and how she thinks that girls should stay virgins as long as possible\u2026 And that only girls who are virgins are 'good'.-Why did Kylie keep saying Derek cheated on her with Ellie? He didn't. When Derek slept with Ellie, he wasn't even with Kylie! But of course CC Hunter rewrote that in this book in the hope that we'd forget that Derek and Kyle were actually broken up\u2026 Why? So CC Hunter could make it seem that what Lucas did to Kylie wasn't actually that big of a deal, especially in comparison to what Derek supposedly did to Kylie. Well, it didn't work on me. Lucas was the only one that cheated. Derek didn't.-The ghosts and the Death Angels were lame. Why did the Death Angels act so mysterious and all knowing? They were clueless and useless.All in all, rubbish. I'm so glad the series is over, I doubt I'll be reading Della's spin-off series. It'll just be the same old bullshit - Della will probably turn into some sort of Mary-Sue-Speshul-Snowflake-Vampire, some manslut teen guy (probably Steve) will be attracted to her snowflakey virginal attitude, he'll treat her like shit, Della will whine and moan but because she's a pathetic doormat she'll forgive him, and then at age 16/17 they'll decide that they're made for each other.

I'm pretty much shocked to the bones that i didn't love this one, especially because it's the last book in the series. Shadow Falls and C.C. Hunter fans...\nIf you don't know what this series is about it follows a 17 year old girl, called Kylie Galen. She is shipped to a supernatural camp, but nobody knows what she is (we find out at the end of book 3). In this book, her story continues. She has to control and learn her powers so she can defeat her ultimate enemy before someone she loves will die. \nLet's get something out there before i'll rant about my disappointment. Shadow Falls is my absolute number 1 favorite series of ALL TIME. Nothing can ever take it's place. I have been in love with this series since the very beginning, and i don't think that will change. In fact, i am kind of obsessed with it. I'm even stalking the authors blog. It't getting rather scary. That's probably why i can't make myself give it a lower rating like it deserves. \nShrink: Sandra, why are you so disappointed? Me: Because it didn't turn out the way i would like it too, and let's just say that i want to claw some of the characters eyes out. Is that a bad thing?Shrink: Oh dear, I'm afraid so. Why won't you tell me now what happened to get you into the condition you are currently in?Good question! A question where unfortunately there are more answers than there should be. First, meet the 3 main characters: \n\n\nYep! You guessed it! It's a love triangle! And one of the reasons why this book was just 'ehhhh' for me.The love triangle had been amazing in the previous books. But in this one? NOT.ANYMORE. I mean, i guess it depends on who's team you're on.What i thought of Lucas (werewolf)?:  \n\nGosh! I hate him so much! I can't believe that Kylie still has feelings for him after what he has done in book 4. I would have kicked his sorry ass so freaking hard and fast he would fly to freaking China and back in record time. That d*ck! Can't he, like, fall off a cliff already?What i thought of Derek ( half-fae)?:\n\n\nDerek *daydreaming*. I love him! He's nice, kind, smart, helpful, understanding, HOT, and just perfect for me. If i could shove my head in his ass and live there, i would. What i wouldn't do to see him naked! *drool*.\nWhat i thought about Kylie?: I loved her in the previous books! But i had a hate/love relationship with her in this one. Sometimes she was just so stupid and annoying! All she really thought about was that darn idiotic Lucas!\nThe book was also very predictable at times. But there were some nice twists that i didn't see coming. And i absolutely LOVE C.C. Hunter's writing style. There are no stupid metaphors that don't even make sense, and no hard vocabulary words that you have to get a dictionary for in order to know the meaning of when the characters are speaking (e.g momentous, inferior,erroneous, ect)When Kylie finally chose between Derek and Lucas:First i was like...\nThen i was like... \nThen it all sunk in and i was like\n\n\nKylie you chose the wrong guy! I'm telling you! \n\nAnd the author is all like \n Not only that! But the guy who was left behind? She decided to ship him off with some other chick, thinking that his fans would be 'OK' with it. WE ARE NOT OK WITH IT!And the relationship with Kylie and the guy she chose was FORCED on us from the beginning. C.C. was like literally shoving it down our throats! It was UNREALISTIC and RIDICULOUS! And all the flaws that the guy had? Well, they magically just disappeared. It was obvious C.C. was trying to make us like him. SORRY, BUT IT DIDN'T WORK! What i really loved though, was the beautiful friendship the characters had with each other. Della, Miranda and Kylie are such epic BFFS! I also naturally loved their boyfriends (Perry, and Steve *hello there*!)They are all, like, one big supernatural family that always looks after each other, and it's so heart warming! \nOverall, Chosen at Nightfall was a good read. It was nothing compared to the previous books, but it was still pretty good. If not for the stupid romance and Kylie choosing the wrong guy (in my opinion) it would have been SO much better! Look out for Della's books! Yep! She's having her own series! The 1st one comes out in 2014!!! Are you in?

I can however say that even though I predicted it, I still enjoyed it. I have a few issues with it- but seeing as the series is over I'll just put them to rest too. I really don't understand how people can pick Lucas.

They've always- to me- had more of a physical connection just.Derek is ALWAYS there for Kylie and is so sweet. I think they have more of a soul mate connection.

Kylie had developed into a whiny self-obsessed pansy who spent most of the book too afraid to face her own problems. Sorry to any Lucas fans but I thought she made a poor decision and the ending was forced. Lucas was an over-controlling, possessive and jealous a## the entire time and she glorified him and refused to see any flaws in him. I think it would be different if their relationship was based on more than just a schoolyard crush but it wasn't. He loves her because she is an obedient goody-two-shoes pansy and she loves him because he's... hunky? They made this couple out to be this great love and it was horrible because the characters were not likable and had really nothing in common. I really wished they would show what happens when all they have in common is their vanity and the ability to say \"I love you\" with a straight face. So back to the ending, Lucas gets on Council as I predicted early on and... what hundreds on years of ideals and traditions go down the toilet because Lucas is a brat. The more I write this review the more I realize that I dislike this book because I dislike both Kylie and Lucas. I also dislike how there are no consequences for anything. Kylie kills a man brutally and Lucas is her accomplice but it's okay because he was evil. I just hated the book for glorifying weak and crappy characters and chalking everything up to some sort of fate or destiny. People make their own choices and not everything is so binary but this book made it seem like it is and it drove me crazy in the second book too. I vote two enthusiastic thumbs down for poor writing (so many typos and \"yups\"), poor character development and overall cheesy and overrated plot."}, {"userName": "Annabel Blizzard", "userReviewDate": "Dec 24, 2012", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/12772722-annabel-blizzard", "userReview": "JUST CHOOSE LUCAS PLEASE.

Here are some of the reasons why:1) Kylie is selfish and an entirely unlikable character. Throughout the whole series, I just kept wondering why I was reading it. While the others characters in the book tell her how she is awesome and selfless, all I can see is how judgmental and self-centered she is. 2) She is constantly obsessed with doing what is 'right,' which generally involves always telling the truth and not having sex. The moral messages ran rampant throughout the series. Every hundred pages or so, there was another message about the dangers of sex and how bad it is. Although I generally agree that sex is not something to be taken lightly, it is also not a bad thing if two people are consenting, teenagers or not. I got very sick of all the characters who had sex being called sluts, getting pregnant, dying, or otherwise shamed for their actions. Furthermore, the boys could have sex much easier than the girls without being called 'sluts.'3) Kylie is obsessed with her 'real dad' to the point where she begins calling the father that raised her 'stepdad.' What a terrible message! I fail to understand the author's thought process on this - if someone raises you for 16 years of your life and treats you like their own child, they are your father. Especially when your biological father is dead and you only communicate with him because you are a ghost whisperer.4) Back to Kylie is selfish - both the boys in her life (Derek and Lucas) have made what Kylie deems to be 'unforgivable mistakes.' One was having sex with someone while they were broken up and the other was getting betrothed to a werewolf in order to gain a spot on the council (it's complicated). Kylie completely overreacts about both situations and then gets mad when people tell her she is over-reacting, insisting that she wasn't the one who did something wrong. Then, towards the end, she starts being a martyr just to ride on the sorry train. Not impressed.5) Her obsession with telling the truth is also obnoxious. While I generally agree that honesty is a good policy, there are times when someone (especially a teenage someone) would NEVER come clean about what happened. And yet, Kylie always goes running off to Holiday to tell her every little 'sin' she has committed.6) The idea of sinning is obnoxious throughout the series as well. Anytime Kylie thinks about sex she reprimands herself for being 'sinful' (although, to her credit, Christianity is never mentioned). However, for the boys, it is viewed as normal that they want to have sex. Way to perpetuate gender norms.7) Also, back to sex. The idea that sex should never be spontaneous was also heavy throughout the series, as was the importance of virginity for girls. The boys in the book, it was implied, had already lost theirs and were under no such obligations. (It didn't help that all the girls in the series who had lost their virginity were either hated, ended up dead, or faded away from the story.) All our main girl characters were virgins. Again, gender norms were very frustrating. Why was it the girl's job to 'save themselves' for a planned time, while the boys were heavily implied or stated not to be virgins?8) The ignorance of the characters was ridiculous. I bet if you went to any high school in the nation and asked any student what 'blue balls' means. I also bet that they would swear much more than the characters in the book. And they would never use the word 'crappers' or 'frack.'9) The chapter breaks kinda sucked. A lot of them were not well-placed, such that I noticed they were not well done.10) I was disappointed in the ending of the book. While this last installment was heads and tails about the rest, I really would have appreciated an epilogue. All we needed was ten pages about the events ten years after the book. Unless she is planning to write more (but the book clearly said, 'the last of the Shadow Falls novels' on the front), I really would have liked some closure about the characters. Did all these couples last through college and growing up?? They are only sixteen after all! Just would have been nice.All in all, not impressed by the series. It wasn't the worst thing ever, but definitely would not recommend."}, {"userName": "Thubza", "userReviewDate": "Nov 19, 2012", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/12478162-thubza", "userReview": "O.M.G I LOVE THE COVER I can`t wait to see who she ends ends up with......TEAM DEREK!!!:D.

If you loved the first four books, you'll find this one hard to let go off long after you read the last word.Though I wasn't a fan of the series from day one, this captured my attention. It had everything a good supernatural read had: love triangle with two smoking guys, Derek (faerie)and Lucas (werewolf), strong and independent lead (Kylie) and a good plot. Fast forward four books and here we are now, at the end.I was very hesitant to read the book because I knew after I started to read, there was no going back; the end was here. Being one of my favorite series, I didn't want to let it go just yet. But, though I finished the book and loved it, I will always remember the first time I entered the world of Shadow Falls.From the start, Kylie's struggles seemed bigger than mine. After all, it doesn't happen every day that you find out you're not human and that your supernatural pattern isn't readable. Or that you even up being a rare type of supernatural: a chameleon. Let alone the fact that no one even knows what a chameleon is. If I was Kylie, I would have just declared myself human and given up any abilities at the start so I wouldn't have to go through all she went through up to end. Especially those ghosts. If I had to deal with them on a daily basis, I would just throw myself over a cliff or something. Seriously, those ghosts can give you nightmares. But Kylie is the type of person to finish what she starts, even if it means risking her life... again.That is the only thing that bugs me. Kylie had \"valiantly\" risked herself and gone into dangerous situations by herself to spare others. They, however, are still involved and go into the situation unprepared. I know people don't change from one day to another but it's been months! By the fourth book, she should have stopped and realized that trusting at least one other person will stop her from getting into deeper trouble that usual. In this aspect Kylie really needs to grow up and learn from her (many) mistakes.After Kylie left Shadow Falls, she thought she would get all the answers that she wanted- what it meant to be chameleon and where it was she belonged. However, events force her to face her problems head on rather than avoiding them. A pesky new ghost and sword just won't leave her alone. Pretending not to see her causes her nothing but grief. Not to mention all the unresolved drama left over from WHISPERS AT MOONRISE. Fortunately, Hunter cleared all of that up in CHOSEN AT NIGHTFALL.What about those amazing but trying-to-kill-each-other friends of hers? Della, a vampire with a knack to fight for her friends and Miranda, a witch who tends to screw spells up continue to be there for our heroine. They're male \"friends\" also add a little spice into the overall wholeness (and mischievous smiles) of the book. Having the relationships of the people around Kylie was a well-throughout strategy; she is the type to care about others more than herself. I especially love what happens between Holiday and Burnett. I did not see it coming but I loved it.Now for what everyone really wants to know: Derek or Lucas. Personally, I kept switching teams many times throughout the series. Lucas was always the hottie, who I'd like for myself but Derek was kind and wanted the best for her. Fortunately, choosing between these two (irresistible guys) wasn't the main issue like in some novels. Mostly, it still focuses on her finding answers and with them herself. But based on who she ends up with, half of the fans will be delighted and the others displeased. I am among the ones who can accept her decision. I understand her choice, though personally, I would have held everything they did wrong against them for a long time and just be single. But that's just me.Though I was weary as to how Hunter would conclude the series, I can say without a doubt that it does not disappoint. So now that the Shadow Falls series is over, I will wait for whatever new book she releases. Hopefully soon.Rating: 4.5 wandsWill I read anything else C.C. Hunter in the future? Yes.Recommended for: anyone who loves love triangles, supernatural books or has been with Kylie since Born at MidnightBuy the book here: http://www.amazon.com/Chosen-at-Night...Check out more of my reviews Jinxed Reviews.:"}, {"userName": "Jessica (Goldenfurpro)", "userReviewDate": "Aug 11, 2012", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/8096484-jessica-goldenfurpro", "userReview": "[Even though I was Team Derek.

This read had me wanting to punch some of the characters, hug them; or squealing, crying and doing the happy dance! PERFECT! :DDue to how it ended, I don't feel VERY bad at saying goodbye to Kylie, Lucas, Derek, Della, Miranda, Perry, Holiday, Burnett, and each and every character in the book.Of course, if the author could give us an insight on their future, that would extra sauce of awesomesauce! And since I know it's not gonna happen, I feel kinda bad. :(I wanted to see how Lucas and Kylie's trip goes ;)How Della and Steve end up. About Perry and Miranda. And Derek and Jenny. And Burnett and Holiday's baby. Aww.. I'm gonna miss looking forward to this series and crying for more! Even though that's what I'm doing right now!Jeez.. I sound like such a pansy.Anyway.~Flawlessness is not what defines perfection.Flaws + Beautiful heart = Perfect person or whatever :PThis book had a heart of its own. Thumping, pumping, stopping, tripping, at all the right places.~And LOOK at these! :O *_*\n~Now, let's talk about some flaws.C.C. Hunter turned a few scientists and authors into supernaturals. And that really bothered me. It was as if humans aren't capable of achieving such heights of success. But I think I already got over that. Or not. I don't know. I'm just feeling too giddy! *squeeeeeeeeeeee*\nAlso, the book became kind of predictable to me.Halfway through the book, I guessed the spirit, Lucinda, to be Red's mother. And she wanted Mario dead. The facts were too obvious.-> First, she appeared right when Kylie and Mario were going at it, when she unknowingly could've killed Lucas, after running from her grandfather's compound.-> She kept repeating the same statement over and over, that if Kylie didn't kill \"him,\" she herself would die.-> Later that night after Lucas-Kylie confrontation that went like this:She shook her head. \u201cLove isn\u2019t enough!\u201d Tears clouded her vision. That was what she\u2019d finally realized last night. \u201cCan\u2019t you see, Lucas? We\u2019re Romeo and Juliet; we\u2019re the Hatfields and McCoys. We are every bad love story that ever existed. We are people who only hurt ourselves and others by selfishly letting our emotions guide us instead of logic.\u201d..Lucinda told Kylie her son was killed.-> She was murdered. Mario had Red's mother murdered. And she was rogue/evil(that's what I thought at that point of the book), so would've obviously killed many people.-> So far, the spirit hadn\u2019t said one thing that led Kylie to believe she had known her, or that they knew anyone in common.After contemplating for tooooo long, I wrote all the points in my Review Diary. And then I connected the dots.But when I finally got it right..\nAANDD, also like, how Kylie's mom was attuned to supernaturals, and how Kylie always had this bad feeling about John, and when John threatened to hurt Kylie's mom & later when Lucinds stated that her husband had just up & disappeared, it was hard not to make the connection.All this contemplation, suspicions and prediction, on my part, and obviously my fault, took away the .5 star. But the good, the aws, the cutes, the squeals, the happy/frustrated/sappy tears and the happy dance, again on my part, outweighed anything bad here! x)~\nAnd Fredericka FINALLY got over Lucas and crushed over someone else. Someone who had the hots for her, too. And that someone, thankfully for her, was a were! HAHAHAHAHA.. funny how the person you hate at the start, changes by the end and you grieve about missing 'em too.Whoever said life is weird, didn't know what an understatement that was.\n~Since I don't want to give away the goodies, because there are seriously heap loads of those, I'm zipping my mouth. Or rather, moving away from the computer. After a few lines, that is! *grinning*\nLove conquers all. A happy ending is all that we need.PS. This review is weird. Not in order. I humbly ask you to blame my giddiness.\u2665 XOXO \u2665"}, {"userName": "Jessica", "userReviewDate": "Jul 11, 2012", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/4845879-jessica", "userReview": "Okay, I'm finally getting around to reviewing this. I've been procrastinating writing this cuz I wanted to give a really good review without giving things away. So here we go...I just want to start by saying what an amazing author C.C. is. Her books always pull me in and keep my reading really late into the night, and this book was no different!I was sad going into this book knowing that this will be the last book through Kylie's POV, but C.C. does a really good job at ending her story. I mean she kind of leaves a few things open for Della's story to start up, but it's a good way to end Kylie's POV. It just kind of came to a close, as sad as that sounds. But it was a very good ending!I loved the twists that she put in this book. Like a certain something that keeps appearing out of no where, or a certain scary ghost--lets just say I'm glad I'm not Kylie--that just randomly popping in. The new twists definitely make the book more exciting!!! It keeps you guessing on what is really happening and what it all means. I couldn't beleive how quickly these new twists start off. Lets just say the book starts off a little crazy and then continues to throw curveballs at you until the end. What with some of Kylie's choice and her new quests.Now onto the characters... I liked that we got to get to know her grandpa a little more, though I do wish we could have gotten to know him a little better then we do. It was fun starting off with the Chameleon's and getting to meet new people.Della, I absolutey want to strangle sometimes when it came to her and a certain shape-shifter. But then she'll do stuff that would make me laugh and love her all over again.Miranda...lets just say her pinky gets her into a little bit a trouble. Though I will say it was kinda awesome.Perry, is his normal class clown. But he's also so darn cute with Miranda it's so adorable.Holiday and Burnett's relationship takes the cake for me. Out of all the couples in the book I think theirs is my favorite. Actually I don't think, I know. I was a little worried that we weren't going to get anymore Holiday/Burnett fights, but don't worry about it you still get some, and the fact that they're actually together now just makes it better! They just crack me up. Your either laughing or ahhhhhing whenever they come into the story.Burnett was one of my alltime favorites of the book. For me he just makes you love his character more and more in every book. He still has his unreasonable times, but he wouldn't be Burnett without them.Lucas and Derek...I wont go into that much detail with either of them, I don't want to give away who she chooses. I do just have to say that if you are a strong Team Lucas or Team Derek fan you should just let it go right now. If you go into the book hating one or the other then there are going to be some very upset people. But if your able to go into the book looking at the faults in both guys, but also seeing their amazing qualities, and seeing how Kylie reacts to both boys, then I think everyone will see that Kylie--in my opinion--made the right choice. I will say that I'm so happy that C.C. doesn't drag you to the very end of the book wondering who she's going to choose. Kylie makes her choice pretty early on, which I will forever be greatful for. I just hope that people don't get upset and not finish the book because of it.I'm soooo happy that C.C. is going to continue this series through Della's POV. I was not ready to let go of these characters quite yet, especially after what happens with some of the characters!If you have not read this series yet I totally recommend it!!! And if you have and are waiting for Chosen at Nightfall, I hope you love it as much as I did!!!!!!!!"}, {"userName": "Cynthia ", "userReviewDate": "Nov 19, 2012", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/13309251-cynthia", "userReview": "disappointed she picked Lucas over Derek but a very good book"}, {"userName": "Ileana", "userReviewDate": "Aug 18, 2016", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/32607296-ileana", "userReview": "This whole series was such a joyride!!
