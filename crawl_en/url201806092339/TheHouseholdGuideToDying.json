Because that's certainly what it is. The main character, Delia, is an advice columnist for domestic stuff, as well as a writer of several books based on a modern and cheeky interpretation of the 1861 classic \"Mrs. Beeton's Book of Household Management\". She also happens to be a mother with a loving husband, two young daughters, and end-stage cancer. She figures that her final book should be, in fact, how to manage a household dealing with death. She's flippant, upbeat, well read and extremely funny while dealing with enormous issues head-on (mostly) and unflinchingly. The book moves around in time a bit, back and forth between 17 year old Delia who was making her way in the world as an unwed teenage mother in a small town and the current organized, irreverent, dying-in-as-practical-way-as-she-can Delia. The scope and generosity of her story is difficult to pull away from--there are quiet insights throughout the book that sneak up on you in unexpected ways but hit you like a hammer. It's a charming and ultimately hopeful story that I sincerely gets a lot of attention--it deserves it."}, {"userName": "Jennifer (JC-S)", "userReviewDate": "May 13, 2016", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/283014-jennifer-jc-s", "userReview": "\u2018The first thing I did this morning was visit the chickens.\u2019Delia Bennet, wife and mother aged 39, is dying. Between now, and then, there is a lot Delia wants to accomplish. She has her lists of things to do, her loose ends to tie up, her planning for her husband and daughters once she is dead. Delia is also writing her final book: \u2018The Household Guide to Dying\u2019, the last in a Household Guide series which has included the Garden, Home Maintenance, Kitchen and Laundry. She will address themes such as Palliative Care, Funeral Festivities and Wills and Wishes.

How do you prepare for a future that you are no longer an active part of? Delia\u2019s life is rich and layered: her research for her book \u2013 including attending an autopsy, her regular column of domestic advice, her family.

After all, we are all dying from the day of our birth. She has cancer and only a few months to live, but although she tires easily and is forgetful, she isn\u2019t sick; she can still function in her roles as wife and mother and writer. She has three aims: to prepare herself, her husband and her two young daughters for her imminent death, to see if she can tie up a loose thread from her earlier life, and to finish the book she is writing \u2013 The Household Guide to Dying.Delia fell into writing household guides almost by accident. She began by writing a home hints column for a local newspaper, and developed a following by giving \u2018unusual\u2019, even insulting advice to readers. Some of this is scattered throughout the novel. She now has guides to the kitchen, the laundry, the garden, and home maintenance to her name, and has convinced her editor that there is mileage in a guide to dying \u2013 particularly as she is so well qualified in the area. Information from this guide also appears in the novel, as Delia researches things like coffins \u2013 or caskets, as she finds they are now called \u2013 both for her own use and for the guide book. And she goes back to a small town inQueenslandto try finally to deal with what happened there some fifteen years before.The story thus takes place in three different time periods; September-October, which is the present; some months earlier when she goes toQueensland; and the time when she lived there. This all sounds a bit confusing, butAdelaidehandles it without a false step. The pieces are fitted together like a patchwork quilt, to use a domestic image.This is a sad and moving book; it brought tears even to my cynical eyes. Delia\u2019s plight is rarely sentimentalised, and most of her responses ring true. She is a less angry character than she has a right to be, but not unbelievably accepting. And the sadness is balanced by a variety of humour, from the black to the laugh-out-loud. A guide to dying? Think of the potential readership. And the care of shirts? \u2018It took a stout feminist to withstand the onslaught of the shirt\u2019. There is also a lot of thoughtful, interesting and amusing comment about housework. \u2018Take the washing line, for instance. Here is a site of profound wisdom, generally ignored by men and women alike, despite its centrality to daily life \u2026 There has never been an investigation into the true meaning and function of the Hills hoist \u2026\u2019 \u2018Like an indigenous language that was no longer spoken\u2019, she says, \u2018the lore of household life was rapidly becoming extinct, from descaling kettles to preserving peaches, from the uses for naphthalene to the best method for beer-battering fish\u2019. Adelaideeloquently laments this loss. And it\u2019s not all housework; there are books (including a nice defence of her namesake from Pride and Prejudice) and chickens as well.There is just one point where I thought there was a danger that Adelaidewas pushing Delia over the top of credible response, but she steadies and gets back on the rails. Some readers might have doubts about whether the ending works successfully, and I\u2019d be interested in other opinions. And just nit picking, I question her interpretation of Mrs Beeton\u2019s Book of Household Management (1861). How did women manage before it? she asks, and applauds Mrs Beeton\u2019s image of the mistress of the house as \u2018the Commander of an Army\u2019 marshalling her troops. What she doesn\u2019t say is that Mrs Beeton\u2019s troops were not husband and children, but servants \u2013 the cook, the parlour maid or the poor little maid-of-all-work. The wife from the new middle class for whom Mrs Beeton was writing needed to know how these things were done so she could oversee others doing them; not for her the personal pleasures of mopping and ironing \u2013 if indeed they are ever pleasures, about which Adelaide doesn\u2019t quite convince me. But no doubt nit picking is dealt with in one of the guides.link: Read this review at What Book to Read"}, {"userName": "Jess", "userReviewDate": "Sep 24, 2012", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/4982556-jess", "userReview": "I did not enjoy this book. I tried to read it multiple times and found myself unable to make any head way with it until the past weekend when i sat myself down and forced myself to read it, as afterall it was the book chosen for book club and I had to read it.From the very momment I saw what we would be reading, I had issues with this book. Let me start by saying I'm a very emotional person, and I cry alot when reading a book. So when presented with a book titled  The Household Guide to Dying I knew I was in trouble. I don't think it helped that I've lost friends at a young age to cancer, and so many family members in such a short space of time that I am utterly afraid of the word. It terrifies me. And yet I've read so many books based around it, that although I may cry like a baby, it's never affected me this bad. This book hunted my sleep and not in a good way, it got under my skin and played havoic with my head. I didn't like the protagonist. At all. In fact, I felt for family the whole way through the novel. I cried for them. Not so much because Delia was dying, but because those poor girls were losing their mother, and Achie was watching the love of his life die a slow death. In fact, I'm not so sure the characters in this book are very strong. Maybe it was because of my past, and even the present, but while reading I replaced each character with someone that I knew or had know in that situation and it broke my heart.In terms of the style and way the book was written I was confused. Too much was withheld for too long. The first part of the book where the author is meant to grip their reader and make them want to read more faster, jsut wasn't there. I was bored. It seemed kind of pointless. Honestly until around the last hundred to one-hundred-and-fifty pages of the book I was willing to give it one star. I did not enjoy it. But for some reason, Adelaide started to win my over slightly in the final pages of the book and I can't work out why unless it was due to sympathy. Delia was dying and she was losing everything and you have to be pretty heartless not to feel for there, and I did feel for her, but I didn't like her.What I will say however, is that in the end I wanted to give this book 2.5 stars. Because although I didn't like its set up, or its characters necessarily there were momments in the book when I had to pause and think wow. Sometimes it was because I'd never thought much about the comments and subjects raised before, other times because the way Debre Adelaide explained something was simply too beautiful, but in words, imagery and meaning. However, I phsyically felt sick when she made the blood sausage and had to fight the urge not to vomit. That scene was nasty!Maybe after I've had some time to think about this book, and current situations and personal resemblances have gone one way or another, then maybe the book will get a higher rating. But given my experience reading it, and the strong desire not to read it, I don't think it will be too likely."}, {"userName": "Jo Case", "userReviewDate": "Mar 15, 2013", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/18381350-jo-case", "userReview": "Debra Adelaide has toiled away on the mid-list of the Australian literary scene for decades, writing close to a dozen books (two novels among them) along the way. Her latest book, The Household Guide to Dying, marks her entry into the big time. With rights sold internationally for an estimated $A1 million (after a heated bidding war), this novel comes heavy with expectation. And, I\u2019ll admit, I was intensely wary of all the hype. But, nearly 400 pages later, I\u2019m a convert. This is an exceptional book. To borrow a clich\u00e9: it will make you laugh and cry. Delia is dying of breast cancer. She\u2019s had her final (useless) chemotherapy treatment and now she\u2019s winding down, watching the seasons pass for the last time, preparing her family for life after her death. She tells her husband she\u2019d like him to marry his bookkeeper, considers making a wedding cake for her eight-year-old daughter, and fills the freezer with family favourites. As she\u2019s tying up loose ends, she is drawn back to the northern NSW town she landed in as a pregnant single mother-to-be long ago \u2013 also the site of a tragic, long-submerged event with which she must make her peace before she can begin letting go of life. Delia is a wonderful character: an acerbic advice columnist and author of a bestselling series of household guides to the lost domestic arts. (A reviewer describes one of them as \u201claundry porn\u201d, unintentionally trebling sales.) Intensely practical, she decides to face death by writing her final \u2018how to\u2019 book: The Household Guide to Dying. It\u2019s that combination of matronly practicality and unexpected kookiness that makes Delia so endearing, and draws the reader into her predicament so completely. Similarly, there are two immensely satisfying strands running through the book. The novel is rich in domestic detail: small girls cuddling chickens in bed; Delia\u2019s husband trying to brush plaited hair; ruminations on the rules of clothes-line culture (\u201cOnly a disreputable woman would hang out washing later than nine o\u2019clock\u201d). It is also very, very clever \u2013 weaving in observations about a plethora of subjects, including words and editing, motherhood and Jane Austen, and what our changing domestic rituals tell us about our culture. But, above all, this beautiful book is a love letter to motherhood and domesticity, with all their complex joys and irritations.This review was first published in The Big Issue."}, {"userName": "Kirsten Krauth", "userReviewDate": "Jul 18, 2012", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/8158046-kirsten-krauth", "userReview": "Writing Mothers: Debra Adelaide(This interview is from my blog, Wild Colonial Girl, at: https://wildcolonialgirl.wordpress.co...)When I first read The Household Guide to Dying it felt as if the writer, Debra Adelaide, had somehow stepped inside my head for a while and borrowed my voice. Even though at the time I had no daughters, and I certainly wasn\u2019t dying of cancer, the words felt like they were mine: effortless, flowing, perfectly formed, and delivered with precision timing (at certain key points).There was nothing sentimental about Delia Bennet\u2019s experience of confronting death. It was head on. Even funny. (I got the same tragi-comic feeling reading Sarah Watt\u2019s exquisite contributions to Worse Things Happen at Sea, the memoir she wrote with husband William McInnes, when she was approaching her final days with courage and quiet humour.) Delia plans for the important things. Like how to teach her girls to make the perfect cup of tea. Like whether she is going to fit in her coffin and whether she should practise before the final day comes.When my aunt died of breast cancer, and I grieved deeply for the loss of a true friend, I turned to Debra\u2019s book often, as a self-help guide \u2014 as its title so cleverly predicted I would. Often friends will say \u2018I only read nonfiction\u2019, dismissing novels because the words are not true, as if fictional worlds are somehow empty of meaning. But I\u2019ve always found the opposite: fiction frees the writer to explore darker subjects from a number of angles, not often exposed in memoir or autobiography. As a reader, since a child, I have learnt so much about emotions, about how to tackle the big issues of life vs death, from fictional characters I have loved (and Delia is one).Debra Adelaide is also a mother, and she\u2019s been interested in mothers in various guises. She has edited three collections of stories about mothering \u2014 Motherlove, Motherlove 2 and Cutting the Cord \u2014 with stories from many well-known authors.I spoke to Debra about her experience of balancing the writing life with having children.When you were pregnant, what were your expectations regarding having a baby and writing? Were you planning to write after the baby was born?DA: My expectations were completely and totally unrealistic. I\u2019d been told that new babies just slept all the time, so I planned accordingly. With my first pregnancy I was still researching my doctorate, which I submitted when my baby was five months old. I had completed all the research by the time he was born and was planning to finalise writing up the material after the birth. With the second and the third babies, I had finished drafts of novels while pregnant, and managed to complete revisions before each birth to free myself up \u2014 for a while.What was it like in reality? Did you get any writing done in the first year after your baby was born?DA: Of course, working on anything took a lot longer than I imagined, especially after the first birth, and it was not just a matter of constraints on time and sleep deprivation. I had completely failed to factor in one vital thing \u2014 my desire to sit and gaze at my baby. I had simply no idea how much time I would be spending just being this baby\u2019s mother, and that was as much physical as it was emotional. And I had no understanding before the event that I would desire this more than anything \u2014 more than wanting to read or write, I found I just wanted to sit with him, play with him, sing to him, gaze into his beautiful eyes, wait to catch the first smile, and so on. Obviously I was much more prepared for this with the other two, and less expectant that I would get other, writing, work done.Did you find it difficult to sit down and write? Or was it the opposite? Were you more creative, as you had less time, and had to be super disciplined?DA: I became extremely disciplined. My writing/working days were totally focused. Sometimes I was like a general on operations. For the first time I learned to use small pockets of time, like an hour when the children slept. Previously I could work hard but I always felt I needed an entire day to focus on a project. I also began to work at night, often very late at night. And I started to write creatively when I was pregnant with my second child. In fact, I decided to write the novel The Hotel Albatross the day before I went into labour with her.Did you find the experience of motherhood starting to seep into your characters? Into the way you portray people?DA: Seep is not quite the right word. Since becoming a mother changed everything about me, it also changed my writing. But I\u2019m not conscious that my characters were particularly defined by any of this unless of course they happened to be mothers. But I didn\u2019t create mother characters for a long time, not until I had the idea for the novel that became The Household Guide to Dying. Have you written about any mothers in your fiction before or after the birth? Did having a child mean you had to go back and rewrite or change characterisation? Do you approach the writing of mother characters any differently from other characters?DA: My awareness of how little mothers had written about their experiences of birth, babies, children and so on, led me to edit three collections on the topic, Motherlove, Motherlove 2 and Cutting the Cord. However I wasn\u2019t conscious of this experience affecting my fiction until I wrote The Household Guide to Dying, which, among other things, is deeply informed by a mother\u2019s sensibility, especially in relation to how that mother imagines her family coping after she is dead. There are parts of that novel I expect I could not have written without the experience of being a mother myself. And, interestingly, I always thought the novel was about dying, and books, and poetry, and gardens, and all sorts of stuff, whereas other readers see it as essentially about mothering; one reviewer said it created a \u2018poetics of mothering\u2019, something I quite like, though I don\u2019t pretend fully to understand what that means.I haven\u2019t changed anything about characters because of having children of my own, but on the other hand it is more than likely that I\u2019ve avoided writing about certain things because of the fact. I am not conscious that creating a mother character requires anything special, different, from any other sort of character, but of course one cannot avoid what one understands or knows or apprehends."}, {"userName": "Deborah Ideiosepius", "userReviewDate": "Jun 02, 2011", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/4802663-deborah-ideiosepius", "userReview": "[And the ending. MAJOR SPOILERIn the end Delia dies gently and happily at home in the bosom of her loving family, there are lots of references to her body shutting down, surrendering, ect. It all sounds so idyllic a way of dying, and it is meant to be an upbeat book so I can see why she did that. Nonetheless it bothers me because in my experience there is nothing gentle, calm and serene about a person dying of metastatic cancer, not for the person dying and not for the family. You don\u2019t drift calmly away free of pain in your bedroom at home looking lovingly at your gathers family. Maybe the occasional person. One in a hundred maybe. For the most part it is a drawn out, painful, traumatising and terrifying experience.

When I was reading the first couple of pages I thought \"Oh no...it's another Martha Quest!\" I only say that because of the chickens scratching in the dirt, and I thought in the beginning that Adelaide was going to be like Lessing, who was so wordy and gave so much detail that the joy of reading that is creating the setting and characters in your mind was squashed.I quickly realized that I was wrong. Wrong. Wrong. While there are several passages that are a bit cryptic, it's actually in order to make way for a couple of the twists you're not expecting. Adelaide creates the world of Delia, a household advice columnist, whose snarky and sometimes off-topic responses have made her an Australian icon. Basing her world on the work of Mrs. Beeton, an actual English-woman from the 1800's who wrote Mrs. Beeton's Guide to Household Management beginning at the ripe old age of 21, which offered advice on everything from how to deal with servant's pay to caring for a sick child.Due to the popularity of her column, Delia became famous for her own series of Household Guide books; The Household Guide to Home Maintenance, The Household Guide to the Kitchen, The Household Guide to the Garden and The Household Guide to the Laundry. Pushing the idea the furthest possible, and in order to provide some catharsis for herself upon making the decision to cease unsuccessful chemotherapy treatments, her publisher agreed to The Household Guide to Dying which would provide readers with advice for everything from selecting a coffin (she refused to call it a casket) to making meals ahead to freeze for the family you'd leave behind (if you were a mother as was she).The sections of the book where she talks about the laundry were so tantalizing that I found myself imagining how I'd have my laundry room in the home that my husband promises me we'll someday own. It was striking to me how the attitude in other countries is so different regarding the laundry. I have a friend from Australia and I know that we're still shocked that she doesn't own a clothes dryer; so I laughed out loud when I read the following passage regarding the code of the clothesline:And then, in the suburbs, washing left on the line overnight indicated a serious lapse in domestic care. Probably outright immorality: where was that woman? Off in the ladies' lounge having a shandy, no doubt. It was also a clear invitation to thieves and perverts to jump over your fence and steal your lace bras or frilly underpants should you be silly and vain enough to own them. Finally, you never used dryers. These were for lazy and wasteful people, of those unfortunates who had to live in apartments? In the suburbs, where the sun was generous and a fresh breeze was free, it was a crime not to hang your washing out.One reviewer called her Household Guide to the Laundry \"laundry porn\" and I found myself very disappointed that I'd never get to read the full texts of the tomes to which Delia so often referred. It was a little titilating to read about all the mundane tasks of maintaining your home in such a fresh way, and in a silly way, it was just what I needed to read following my three year-old outburst to my husband a few days ago during which I railed about the fact that I didn't get a gold star by my name at the end of the day; I was gifted only with more exhaustion...good times. The Household Guide is so much more than meets the eye. Taking a journey with Delia through her life as a teen mother who tries to follow the wandering musician of a circus family father of her unborn child to a small town in Northern Australia to her life as a work from home mother of two married to a caring and wonderful landscaper, this book has surprising depth and also a lot of humor. Another thing that struck me was that as she talked about the way she manages her house, it would take the mention of an iPod or MySpace to remind me that this was a 21st century wife, mother and successful writer, just bringing home that it is quite possible to immerse yourself in the running of your home without having to relegate yourself to historical relic. When asked how she chose the topic Adelaide replied \"Authors will often say the reverse, that the idea or the topic or the entire novel chooses them. In my case, I'm not sure that I did choose to write this novel, but I do remember setting myself a challenge to write about dying in a way that would be original and, in particular, comical. Fiction is \u2013 in part, anyway \u2013 the place to confront things and explore ideas that in your own life you are too timid to do. Dying tends to confound most of us, frighten us, make us literally lost for words. We have a lot of trouble finding the right things to say and do when we're required to cope with death. In The Household Guide to Dying, I used the character of Delia as a bold and sometimes confronting voice who is trying to make the idea of dying more palatable to those around her, as well as herself struggling to find the right way to express a process that is profound and universal. Her way is via humour, which for her sometimes works, and sometimes not. And sometimes, despite all her efforts, the words literally evade her.\" Because I get a little 'connected' with my characters (aka, I have a hard time accepting that SJP is not really Carrie Bradshaw), I googled Mrs. Beeton and was excited to learn that she was real, and so is her Household Guide. I then got even more excited when they made a reference to a \"Delia\" (Delia Smith) who is an iconic chef in England. She is a modern figure who announced her TV retirement in 2003 and then filmed a 6 part mini-series in 2008, which aired on BBC. \"The Delia Effect\" is in reference to the fact that she caused such things as a 10% surge in egg sales after her segment on omelettes and several other overnight sell-outs or \"a run on previously poor-selling product as a result of a high-profile recommendation.\" She also wrote a bestseller How To Cheat at Cooking. But alas, it was just a coincidence of the name, as Adelaide reports that no characters were based on true figures.While the title may seem like a real Debbie Downer, it is ultimately a novel about life; an examination by a wife, mother and woman who is finally able to take the time to tie up her loose ends and think about the mark she'll leave on those she leaves behind.You will read this book, if for no other reason than to find out what I mean when I say these two words; blood sausage.Debra Adelaide is the author of two other novels, The Hotel Albatross and Serpent Dust, and the editor of four themed collections of fiction and memoirs, the latest of which is Acts of Dog. She has worked as a researcher, editor and book reviewer, and has a PhD from the University of Sydney. She is now a senior lecturer in creative writing at the University of Technology, Sydney"}, {"userName": "\u30a2\u30de\u30c1\u30e5\u30a2\u8aad\u8005", "userReviewDate": "Feb 04, 2018", "userURL":

She left town when her son was killed in an accident and donated his heart to a young girl. Delia is determined to track her down.There were some humorous aspects of the book, particularly the battles with the neighbour (culminating with her sowing \"Eternity\" into his front lawn) and the advice she provides as part of her column.I think that I read this book at an interesting time. In fact while I was reading the book I went to a funeral and a friend was told that her cancer was incurable. The book certainly gave me a bit to think about given the two events that happened while I was reading it."}, {"userName": "Lesley A", "userReviewDate": "Mar 23, 2018", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/37301845-lesley-a", "userReview": "Death is a poetic moment, realises Delia.

After all, books that find themselves on the bargain tables anywhere are generally there for one reason only. So, it was with some trepidation that I started reading this, and without doing any googling of it prior. The subject matter also was the cause of some trepidation - 30-something Delia Bennet, mother and wife, has been diagnosed with terminal cancer and is planning for her death, or as the back cover says, realizing that it was now 'time to get her house in order'. Hardly the happiest of topics for a leisure reader. Cancer, like taxes, does not discriminate on the basis of age, sex, colour, creed, socio-economic status etc. One, however does not die of taxes. And, we know about taxes, we confront them daily, but death is really something we know very little about and not something we face on a daily basis, or really that we like to talk about. My feelings of trepidation, being price and subject matter, however were groundless. Despite the undoubtedly sad and difficult subject matter, this is a story of such warmth, love, remorse, tragedy and humanity told in such an achingly normal sort of fashion that it has stayed with me long after finishing. Moving between the present and the past, Delia decides to add to her successful series of household management guides by writing the ultimate guide - The Householder's Guide to Dying. Her past guides have covered the erstwhile subjects of home maintenance, laundry, garden, and kitchen. In addition she continues to answer questions in a very acid fashion in a newspaper advice column on same household matters. Faced with a death sentence, and being a practical, organised sort of lady, Delia forces herself to deal with planning her own funeral, what advice and messages she should give her two young daughters, what type of coffin she should choose, a daily timetable for her husband on family management and so it goes on. And let's not forget the five pet hens. As she does her research, she documents it all into a manuscript for publication into her final book. Facing up to your death of course, means that you also have to deal with the demons of the past. Delia traces her steps back some fifteen years, leaves her home in what I presume is Sydney, and goes back to Queensland where, as a pregnant teenager she gave birth to a son. And that is all I will say about this particular strand of the story because the events that took place when she was a young woman shaped the woman who is now coming to terms with this latest and last challenge in her life. I really, really liked this book. Being a mother and wife, and dealing on a regular basis with cancer patients, I thought this would be a desperately sad and morbid book, totally sentimental and a complete slush-fest. It is sad, I had tears in my eyes at several points, but it is never morbid and throughout you are aware of how much life there is going on around Delia all the time. More importantly for Delia, and hence the reader, how life will continue when she is no longer around, and how it can be joyful. Now if all that sounds a bit too new-agey, I am probably not doing a very good job writing this, because I am the most un-new-agey person ever. I wondered while reading this if the author had suffered herself from cancer, there is such a personal feel to the writing. I later found out that her son was diagnosed with leukaemia, and successfully treated for it while she was writing the book. Hence the empathy for her subject I guess, and perhaps some sort of catharsis too. I find it a little disturbing that a book long listed for the Orange Prize should end up on a bargain book table!"}, {"userName": "Marilyn", "userReviewDate": "Dec 05, 2013", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/4739493-marilyn", "userReview": "Two stars for the first half, almost didn't get to the last half which is 4 stars.Delia, the writer of household guides, tells her editor her latest book is \"a guide to dying not death\u2026 Death is a condition, but dying is an act. It\u2019s a noun versus a verb\u2026 not just a matter of grammar. I can write about dying because I know about it, I\u2019m doing it.\" She simultaneously deals with resolution of the long ago death of her first child, and her own process of dying of cancer. Delia's approach has been to organize her death, and then begins writing the book \u201cknowing I was making something useful of my own death.\u201dSuch single-mindedness served her as commander of the household but also points out the frustration common to many women: \"I wondered if these lists said more about me or Archie. I\u2019d spent too many mornings\u2026explaining to him what needed to be done\u2026.as if I\u2019d been at the control center of a military exercise, a full-scale war, instead of a partner in a marriage that included two young children. I tried every method available to the reasonable woman. Pointing out the lapses in a kind way\u2026Barking out orders like a sergeant major\u2026Saying nothing. Saying everything. Standing by pretending to be preoccupied\u2026but internally writhing\u2026. Writing lists. Not writing lists. Doing none of the tasks. Doing half the tasks.\"The author shows Delia's progress in letting go, but also explains that it never seemed misplaced to her: \"Archie was wrong (about her being a control freak). I cared nothing for the clean house, just for what it represented. There was an orderly calmness and security in this house, and it didn\u2019t just happen. I made it that way. Just the word home meant profound things to me. Home was where I wanted to be. I couldn\u2019t help it\u2013and I wouldn\u2019t apologize-for wanting to make the place where my family lived as comfortable as it could be, and\u2026keeping it clean was part of it.\"Now dying, she makes peace with it all. \"I can now adore every particle of them and yet for the first time want to leave, without a single stab of guilt. That\u2019s a surprise, too. I imagined dying to be similar to leaving them at the school gate on the first day, knowing you have to go, you want to go, but every muscle screaming as much as them to stay, every cell clawing you back. But no, now I\u2019m feeling it for the first and last time in my life, I discover it isn\u2019t like that at all. I am calm. I feel no pain. I watch them coming and going and my heart could not be fuller with them, but I experience total freedom. I can\u2019t have loved them more. Although I want them I can let them go.

She has had a double mastectomy, all the trearment she can handle and now is the time that she must make herself ready for her death. She is a writer of household guides Laundry, gardening the Kitchen etc and she has a brainwave that she will write a guide to \"Dying\", to help others!She takes us back to a time 22 years before all this happens, to another life she lived but which was also connected to todays life, (you will see when you read the book, as I hope you will!).She got pregnant by a musician when young and went off to find him. She didn't, but made a life for herself in a small town called Amethyst in Australia, (the story is set in Australia, but could be anywhere), She bought a caravan and lived there bringing up her beautiful son Sonny for 8 years until a terrible accident killed Sonny and left her bereft. Sonny's heart was transplanted into a little girl who needed it and we find Delia going back to Amethyst to try and find the young girl before she dies. The book jumps (quite gently) back and forth from then to now.She is writing her book, making lists and trying to smoothe her families passage through her death. At times she comes across as very controling and sometimes a bit odd, like when she decides she loves her family so much she wants to leave a part of her behind and makes some blood sausage usung her own blood!! (yes I did say her own blood!!) but she later throws them away!The book is quite gentle in the way it comes across, she has the time to do the things she wants for her family (filling the freezer with home cooking, planning her daughters wedding, choosing a possible partner for her husband Archie!)but realises at the end that really none of it matters, as she puts it \"Death is a poetic moment\".I really enjoyed this book after s slow start.

Now she is dying of cancer and so she decides to use her experience to write one final guide: The Household Guide to Dying. While writing and researching this book (Delia learns about autopsies or coffins for example), she is also preparing her own family for her demise and coming to terms with a tragedy that occurred in her own life, several years previously.The first half of the book is quite slow as we get to know Delia and her family. The introduction of the sub-plot, which involves Delia as a teenager, is initially quite confusing to read. The second half is stronger, as the characters become more developed. As a mother I found it almost unbearable to read about the ways that Delia prepares her young daughters for her death: making lists to help them plan their far-off weddings, teaching them the art of the perfect boiled egg and letting them illustrate her coffin.Having said this, while I enjoyed and was moved by this book, I always felt detached from it. I admired Delia's strength, I laughed at her witty replies in her advice column and I felt for her grieving husband, but somehow the characters never became real people for me. I felt emotional at the end, but I also felt that the emotion had been manipulated out of me rather than arising spontaneously: like the difference between breastfeeding and expressing milk.The author, Debra Adelaide, lectures creative writing in Sydney, where the novel is also set. The local references and jargon are very much part of this book. It might be helpful for the reader to know that Arthur Stace was a man who repeatedly wrote the word \"eternity\" in chalk on the sidewalks of Sydney for 35 years."}], "description": "Delia has made a living writing an acerbic advice column and a series of wildly successful modern household guides.
