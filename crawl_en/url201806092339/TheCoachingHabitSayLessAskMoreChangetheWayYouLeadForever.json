I thought it interesting he named so many other bestselling books, but found it disappointing, too. Upon picking this up from NetGalley, I was looking for new insights and a new expert I can rely; not someone else rehashing and selling me wisdom already provided by Dan Pink or Heath Bros. My own organization is trying to shift from \"managing\" to \"coaching\" and I was really curious to know what the key questions are to help unlock the two-way dialogue between coach and coachee. I was so bummed that the #1 question to set the tone is \"What's on your mind?\" How many times has my own manager asked me that and my mind goes blank or way too many items bubble to the surface that I am overwhelmed with muteness. I know I need a better question to help unlock what's challenging me and I suspect that's also the case with others.I would have preferred to see more conversational options to help kickstart a coaching session. I understand Ken Blanchard, for instance, has 101 starting questions. Perhaps this book could have enlightened me with more options than \"What's on your mind?\"I know many skilled managers/coaches can likely come up with other ways to warm up the conversation, but we'll lose precious time as we keep striving for rapport to get the ball rolling. This is especially a pain when our coaching session is no more than 30 minutes. Which is why I would have appreciated more kickoff tips to figure someone's trigger.The remaining questions -- \"And what else?,\" \"What's the real challenge here for you?,\" etc. -- were ok suggestions, but the remaining experience was ruined for me because I just could not unblock myself past the author thinking that #1 question was going to magically open the conversational doors."}, {"userName": "Ron", "userReviewDate": "Jan 24, 2016", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/1862332-ron", "userReview": "This is my new favorite book on coaching. Before I would have said Quiet Leadership by David Rock. Executive Coaching with Backbone and Heart is also great for current practitioners. What this book excels at, what sets it apart, and what makes it my favorite is that he understands one target audience - the audience that could most benefit - and he wrote a book that actually has a shot of being implemented by them.Coaching is not difficult in principle. We've all heard we should be doing it if we are managing or leading others. But almost no one does it, and even fewer do it well. So he has written a book for time-crunched managers that is close to idiot-proof. And he starts in a habit formation and behavior change frame. This is the novel and crucial piece that makes it my favorite. Thank you. Since I work in leadership development and am responsible for training managers, this book is an awesome resource to have. I can already tell this will be my most recommended book of 2016 while at work."}, {"userName": "Rod Moser", "userReviewDate": "Feb 23, 2016", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/5200376-rod-moser", "userReview": "This book is absolutely BRILLIANT!I have served as a Team Leader with Keller Williams, a managing broker of the largest Century 21 office in the world, and now, as a professional real estate coach. I work with many agents around the country to improve efficiencies and best business practices while growing their businesses.I was constantly getting caught in the usual traps (without having much in the way of professional coaches training) of going through a coaching session without really feeling like I had had an impact. We would get caught in the usual small talk. I would choose a problem that I thought they might have and go down a bunny trail only to find out later that the solution I was pursuing wasn't the real problem.Michael's book is exactly what I was looking for! He discusses critical questions in a coaching session that will allow you to be less \"helpful\" and more helpful. I was creating co-dependence with many of my agents because I wasn't allowing them to create new neuro-connections and truly learn.From bookends of a coaching session to digging deeper to discover the real issue to removing yourself from the drama triangle, this book is a must read for anyone looking to improve communication and coaching skills. I believe teachers, parents, managers, and coaches would all benefit from reading Michael's book. I particularly enjoyed the video blogs that delved deeper into the meaning of the chapter I had just read. Not only did it give me a better understanding of the material, but it allowed the message to connect a little deeper.Throughout the book, Michael ties in ideas on creating the right habits (pulling from The Power of Habit by Charles Duhigg) so that you begin to recognize the triggers that would get you off track, and create new habits that will help you become a better coach.I am changing my coaching style after reading Mr. Bungay Stanier's The Coaching Habit."}, {"userName": "Marshall", "userReviewDate": "Oct 04, 2016", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/11966831-marshall", "userReview": "The book provides a great framework of asking coaching questions.The kickstart question: \u201cWhat\u2019s on your mind?\"The awe question: \u201cAnd what else?\"The focus question: \u201c What\u2019s the Real Challenge Here for You?\"The lazy question: \"How Can I Help?\"The foundation question: \u201cWhat do you want?\"The strategic question: \u201cIf You\u2019re Saying Yes to This, What Are You Saying No To?\"The learning question: \u201cWhat was most useful for you?\u201dGreat Quotes\u201cMany leaders told us they don\u2019t have the time in this high-pressure economy for the slow and tedious work of teaching people and helping them grow.\u201dBungay Stanier, Michael (2016-02-29).

First, you\u2019ve trained your people to become excessively reliant on you, a situation that turns out to be disempowering for them and frustrating for you. And then as an unwelcome bonus, because you\u2019ve been so successful in creating this dependency that you now have too much work to do, you may also have become a bottleneck in the system. Everyone loses momentum and motivation. The more you help your people, the more they seem to need your help.

They are personal and challenging, and they provide a place where people\u2019s self-knowledge and potential can grow and flourish.

He then looked at the success rate of decisions that involved more choices. For instance, what would happen if you added just one more option: Should we do this? Or this? Or not? The results were startling. Having at least one more option lowered the failure rate by almost half, down to about 30 percent. When you use \u201cAnd what else?\u201d you\u2019ll get more options and often better options. Better options lead to better decisions.

When you take the premium that your organization places on answers and certainty, then blend in the increased sense of overwhelm and uncertainty and anxiety that many of us feel as our jobs and lives become more complex, and then realize that our brains are wired to have a strong preference for clarity and certainty, it\u2019s no wonder that we like to give advice.

I'm virtually scratching my head at that...it's a trifold tract blown up with repetitious cliches, buzzwords, self-help stuff, and a lot of name- and book title-dropping.

I think he misses his target by a wide margin. Note: I do agree that asking questions is important. But asking questions is only the start of coaching leadership. Maybe *I* missed his point.

The questions are well thought out, and solve real problems: When people spiral negatively, you ask them: What's the real challenge for you here? To take them back up. When they're not generating enough options, you ask them: And what else? One of my favorite examples from the book is how when people are presented with two options; they make worse decisions than choosing at random. However, if a 3rd option is presented\u2014they make much better decisions on average (I'm not sure how a study like that is conducted, but I definitely agree with this).Another quote from the book that made me think was: \"It doesn't matter if you've mastered all the productivity books in the world; the faster you dig, the faster the world keeps flooding in.\" I observe this myself too, that more time in doesn't yield more output\u2014it often just generates more and less important work. It makes you say no less, without proportionally increasing output. The big takeaway from this book is that it's not your job to offer solutions, it's your job to ask the questions that lead to solutions\u2014that's coaching. The book ends up referring to one of my favorite books, Make it Stick, how people generate memories by AGES: Attention, Generation, Emotion, Spacing. If people aren't generating their own ideas and answers, they don't remember them. I prefer the articulation in \"What Got You Here Won't Get You There\", of not trying to 'add too much value'\u2014although the book does use some of this vocabulary. It's clear that the author is well-read in the management and leadership literature, it's great to see books references and ideas iterated on."}, {"userName": "Karen Stanton", "userReviewDate": "Sep 28, 2017", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/38918091-karen-stanton", "userReview": "This is one of the best coaching books I've ever read.

The key questions that the book recommends are: - What's on your mind? - And what else? - What's the real challenge here for you? - What do you want? - How can I help? - If you're saying yes to this, what are you saying no to? - What was the most useful _____ in this project/situation? The book does describe the psychology behind these questions and other variations. In addition, throughout the book, I also found a number of other various insights: - Managers should focus on coaching for development, not for performance. - Asking why often puts people on the defensive. Therefore its often best to start asking the question with \"what\"- The brain works better when it feels safe. To avoid putting people on the defensive, its important to keep four aspects in mind: 1) having autonomy2) having clear expectations for the future3) perceiving to be equal in status4) perceiving to be on the same team To the extent that these four things hold true, people are less likely to be on the defensive. Another good insight: It also very common for people to get overwhelmed as there is always more to do's than time to complete them. Therefore, managers should play an active role in helping their people not get overwhelmed and help them either refuse tasks or move them down the priority list. It also talks about four drivers of long term memory. This is important to ensure people are retaining things that they learn. The four drivers are:- Attention- Generation- Emotion- Spacing The book didn't really good too much into these because they borrowed these from another book. However regarding generation: basically its better if people come up with their own theory. This is where asking guided questions come in."}, {"userName": "Noah", "userReviewDate": "Feb 01, 2016", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/51765823-noah", "userReview": "Amazing!

We are both in the business of coaching entrepreneurs and business owners and executives, and always working hard to raise our game and our effectiveness with them, so the perspective of reading this book for me was that of a coach and the desire to become a better coach through the powerful questions.I had the pleasure of meeting Michael a couple of times and sharing a meal with him once in Toronto. Very bright man. I like the way he thinks and A Box of Crayons is making a big dent in the world of managers and companies. Having said that, the book was fantastic but the details were too much for my taste. I like the big picture, the high-level strategy, and the questions that he teaches you to ask, and the habits that you form by asking those powerful questions rather than answering / telling the client what they need to do is great. A 5-star. I'll use them in my coaching and refer this book to clients who can use it in their work.The part that did not speak to me, but I suspect it did to my scientist friend who recommended it, is the research behind why a question matters more or less. I honestly don't feel my interest goes that deep. My interest is in helping the person in front of me, and for me, those parts were where I skimmed and moved right along.The powerful questions are good. You can probably find out what they are easily without reading the book but I like to support authors and I recommend you do the same.Oh and there are videos that he has done on a page on his website that complement the work in the book and I found those to be inspiring as well.The Coaching Habit will be one of the books that I recommend and use in my coaching."}, {"userName": "Cris Ferreira", "userReviewDate": "Feb 28, 2016", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/3994343-cris-ferreira", "userReview": "In Coaching Habit, Michael Bungay Stainer presents 7 questions to be used in conversations between a coach and their coachees.

So if you want to follow his advice and start using the power questions, you can highlight the parts of each chapter that he shows how to change the old habit, by identifying the trigger that might lead to the old behavior, and start using the power questions instead.At the end of each chapter, the author also presents scientific information (from scientific researches) that confirms the applicability of each question in real life.As I said, it is a book that focuses not only on theories, but on the practical side of leadership.

Drawing on years of experience training more than 10,000 busy managers from around the globe in practical, everyday coaching skills, Bungay Stanier reveals how to unlock your peoples' potential. He unpacks seven essential coaching questions to demonstrate how--by saying less and asking more--you can develop coaching methods that produce great results. \u2013 Get straight to the point in any conversation with The Kickstart Question \u2013 Stay on track during any interaction with The Awe Question \u2013 Save hours of time for yourself with The Lazy Question \u2013 and hours of time for others with The Strategic Question \u2013 Get to the heart of any interpersonal or external challenge with The Focus Question \u2013 and The Foundation Question \u2013 Ensure others find your coaching as beneficial as you do with The Learning Question A fresh innovative take on the traditional how-to manual, the book combines insider information with research based in neuroscience and behavioural economics, together with interactive training tools to turn practical advice into practiced habits. Witty and conversational, The Coaching Habit takes your work--and your workplace--from good to great. \"Coaching is an art and it's far easier said than done. It takes courage to ask a question rather than offer up advice, provide and answer, or unleash a solution. giving another person the opportunity to find their own way, make their own mistakes, and create their own wisdom is both brave and vulnerable. In this practical and inspiring book, Michael shares seven transformative questions that can make a difference in how we lead and support. And he guides us through the tricky part - how to take this new information and turn it into habits and a daily practice. --Bren\u00e9 Brown, author of Rising Strong and Daring Greatly", "title": "The Coaching Habit: Say Less, Ask More & Change the Way You Lead Forever", "url": "http://www.goodreads.com/book/show/29342515-the-coaching-habit", "average": 4.01, "cover": "https://images.gr-assets.com/books/1456463829l/29342515.jpg", "reviews": 380, "authors": [{"url": "https://www.goodreads.com/author/show/2899298.Michael_Bungay_Stanier", "name": "Michael Bungay Stanier"}], "type": ["Business", "Leadership", "Nonfiction", "Business", "Self Help"], "outlinks": ["http://www.goodreads.com/book/show/29342515-the-coaching-habit", "http://www.goodreads.com/book/show/27286963-the-coaching-habit", "http://www.goodreads.com/book/show/6366374-do-more-great-work", "http://www.goodreads.com/book/show/12545279-end-malaria", "http://www.goodreads.com/book/show/6482292-find-your-great-work", "http://www.goodreads.com/book/show/22089247-get-unstuck-get-going-on-the-stuff-that-matters", "http://www.goodreads.com/book/show/18653075-great-work-provocations", "http://www.goodreads.com/book/show/16498123-a-guide-to-the-present-moment", "http://www.goodreads.com/book/show/40198297-hunting-eichmann", "http://www.goodreads.com/book/show/40193094-the-breaks-of-the-game", "http://www.goodreads.com/book/show/5312677-celebration-of-discipline", "http://www.goodreads.com/book/show/40243434-soul-keeping", "http://www.goodreads.com/book/show/22561514-the-autobiography-of-eleanor-roosevelt", "http://www.goodreads.com/book/show/31391295-how-to-be-a-bawse", "http://www.goodreads.com/book/show/8143199-how-remarkable-women-lead", "http://www.goodreads.com/book/show/5440602-how-soccer-explains-the-world", "http://www.goodreads.com/book/show/40193421-dry", "http://www.goodreads.com/book/show/40204948-a-truck-full-of-money", "http://www.goodreads.com/book/show/40229444-animal-liberation", "http://www.goodreads.com/book/show/19485478-a-woman-in-charge", "http://www.goodreads.com/book/show/38272015-the-measure-of-a-man", "http://www.goodreads.com/book/show/40203910-32-yolks", "http://www.goodreads.com/book/show/40193675-recovery", "http://www.goodreads.com/book/show/18880380-enemies", "http://www.goodreads.com/book/show/36693639-victoria", "http://www.goodreads.com/book/show/40203983-being-nixon", "http://www.goodreads.com/book/show/20960501-100-days-of-real-food", "http://www.goodreads.com/book/show/40268935-barbarians-at-the-gate", "http://www.goodreads.com/book/show/26064021-things-no-one-will-tell-fat-girls", "http://www.goodreads.com/book/show/29465033-whipping-girl", "http://www.goodreads.com/book/show/19730030-a-history-of-warfare", "http://www.goodreads.com/book/show/22844509-best-friends", "http://www.goodreads.com/book/show/18939110-let-it-go", "http://www.goodreads.com/book/show/40192801-future-crimes", "http://www.goodreads.com/book/show/13576617-still", "http://www.goodreads.com/book/show/35525893-sick-in-the-head", "http://www.goodreads.com/book/show/40205119-paris-1919"]}
