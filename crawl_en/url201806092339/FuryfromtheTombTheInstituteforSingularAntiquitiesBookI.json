Upon getting them to America, the mummies are stolen by ghouls and hauled off to Mexico. Will Rom ever find his mummies?This was a Netgalley find, chosen by my love of Indiana Jones and similar tales.Okay, I didn't technically finish reading this book but I'm finished for all intents and purposes. I'm not going to tear into the book. I'll just say what I liked and why the book didn't work for me and we can all move on with our lives, hopefully without shots fired.The book had potential that just wouldn't quit. There's tomb crawling, mummies, vampires, a giant worm or two, gunslinging, and all sorts of other makings for a grand adventure.My big problem with the book is that it's written in the first person. In and of itself, that's fine, and the writing was good in a technical sense. However... to put it gently, imagine how you would feel about Star Wars if C3PO was narrating it? The narrator is an Egyptologist in the late 19th century who manages to suck the excitement out of every situation with his overwrought vocabulary. While I'm sure his wordiness has some degree of authenticity, that does not a good story make. Every time I picked the book back up, I sighed, thinking \"Will this windbag just get on with it?\"Now, if you enjoy this book, more power to you. It was not my particular cup of tea at this time. Two out of five stars."}, {"userName": "Josh", "userReviewDate": "Apr 21, 2018", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/1108056-josh", "userReview": "Horror, adventure, the supernatural, and Egyptology seasoned with a spice of the wild-west fuel this journey into the unknown. Romulus Hardy, an eager Egyptologst is commissioned to travel to Egypt to unearth the tomb of a mysterious yet powerful Pharaoh - he ultimately succeeds but success comes at great cost with the band of men on his expedition loosing their lives. On bringing the sarcophagus back to America, his mysterious benefactor remains aloof, communicating only by letters and messages passed down by minions. Promptly re-routed from New York, his journey lands him and his precious cargo on a train heading towards LA, only for it to be hijacked by a criminal gang but that's only the start of the horrors. There's a lot to like about Fury from the Tomb, however I really enjoyed the character dynamic the most; there's a gunslinger, a young and fierce companion, the attractive Evangeline daughter of the benefactor, a ghoul who adds a comical element and the sorcerer himself; they all complement one other and bring a little something to the broader story. This Indian Jones pulpy adventure circa 1888 won't appeal to everyone but it does have loads of tense and horror-infused moments that are a joy to read. My rating: 4/5 stars, reading well as a standalone, I'm interested to see what direction future installments take."}, {"userName": "Chad", "userReviewDate": "May 07, 2018", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/25388909-chad", "userReview": "A Mummy story set in the Old West. Romulus Hardy, burgeoning Egyptologist, sets out on his first expedition and uncovers more than he bargained for. While bringing the mummies to California, they are stolen and he has to track them down before they are used to take over the world.This is setup as some kind of Indiana Jones, pulpy adventure. The problem is that it's told first hand in letters from Romulus Hardy. He's a huge windbag and drones on for pages before getting to any kind of point. Every time I got to one of these passages, my mind wondered until I found myself having to suffer through the passage 3 or 4 times. My other problem with the book is that no one is freaked out when the supernatural occurs. They act like it's no big deal they see ghouls or giant worms. I did, however, like the 4 main characters and their relationships."}, {"userName": "Dana Kenedy (Dana and the Books)", "userReviewDate": "Apr 22, 2018", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/372001-dana-kenedy-dana-and-the-books", "userReview": "3.5 -- review to come"}, {"userName": "Paul", "userReviewDate": "May 16, 2018", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/4164688-paul", "userReview": "Take it from me, I work in higher education, Dr Romulus Hugo Hardy is your quintessential academic. He is the consummate scholar, happy to wax lyrical about bygone ages and learn the secrets of times past. He dreams about travelling to Egypt and discovering what once was lost. Enter mysterious benefactor, Montague Pythagoras Waterson. Hardy is offered the opportunity of a lifetime. Throwing caution to the wind Hardy embraces his inner explorer and engages in some suitably action-packed field work. Far from the safe confines of the reference library, deep in the desert, our erstwhile hero finds himself coming face to face with an ancient evil.I think the thing I like most about the good doctor is his transformation as the story unfolds. That dawning realisation when Hardy admits to himself that he needs to fight the horrors, feels palpable. Turns out attempting to derail the forces of darkness is going to change anyone however staid they may be.The plot has a globetrotting feel. From New York to Egypt and then onwards to the American/Mexico border the narrative rattles along, keeping the reader on their toes. In the fine tradition of vintage heroes like Indiana Jones* or Doc Savage, there is much derring-do on display. Hardy meets some interesting characters along the way. Miss Evangeline is the embodiment of practicality. Far smarter than just about everyone around her, she is more than a match for any one of them. Then there is the enigmatic gunslinger Rex McTroy. Hardy is more of a thinker than a doer, so having a sharpshooter onside is more than a little use.The reverential nods towards its cinematic forebears are well handled. Fury From The Tomb does a grand job of tapping into that sense of adventure. Where things differ is the tone of the novel. Fury has a nice vein of Cthulhu flavoured otherworldliness running straight through the middle of it. Turns out, mummies are a vile bunch. Add to that some cannibalistic monks and undead banditos, and you\u2019ll start to see a trend developing. There are flashes of horror dotted throughout the text that manage to add both a sinister and gross overtone to proceedings. From a personal perspective I found the giant maggots were particularly gruesome. I was repulsed and entranced in equal measure.As an aside, I would be remiss if I didn\u2019t mention the first-rate cover design. The artwork by Daniel Strange enhances the retro stylings of the text it is partnered with. It\u2019s exactly the sort of image I would happily make into a poster, frame it and put it up on a wall. The distinctive classic B movie cover art is one of the first reasons I was keen to read the book. It is very effective in suggesting the delights that lie within.The first book featuring the exploits of The Institute for Singular Antiquities is a rare find. This homage to old school adventure is great fun and delivers exactly what it promises. Entertaining, exciting and unexpected, Fury From The Tomb will keep any action and adventure fan hooked from page one. My only hope is that this story is the first of many.*Seriously, I could almost picture a thick red line moving from destination to destination on a tattered old map."}, {"userName": "Robert Bose", "userReviewDate": "May 08, 2018", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/3327494-robert-bose", "userReview": "I fantastic cross between weird western and classic pulp.

Sidor's novel provides; there's more than one ancient, enwrapped, dead mofo a-lurchin' about in \"Fury From the Tomb\" (no, that's not a side project of band Rocket From the Crypt). A title like that and a B-movie-poster cover promise fun \u2014 and it is, though maybe not quite as much fun as it thinks.\"Fury From the Tomb\" is an unholy (of course; there's mummies brought back from the dead!) fusion of old-school pulp fiction, a gonzo mummy movie whose dailies got mixed up with a bandit Western's, and Indiana Jones \u2014 there's tomb raiding by an academic/adventurer, after all. Here, a young Egyptologist, Romulus Hardy, is hired by a mystery man to dig up an Egyptian mummy and bring him to America in 1888. This grave robbing isn't accomplished with quite as much panache as could be hoped, especially considering that there's a roaring tunnel of blood. Turns out this mummy was a very bad apple who won't stay dead (aren't they always?). Once in the U.S., Hardy is eventually joined by a hottie blonde, a Chinese boy with strange parents and a bounty hunter, who band together after a train attack and mummy swipe by cannibal banditos. Yes, Sidor is putting fresh/wild spins on some old tropes, but it's worth noting that the novel doesn't really get engrossing until it amps up the interplay among our hero foursome in the middle third. And though \"Fury\" really is enjoyable, and Sidor writes pretty well, its problem is that, for a novel that's unashamedly pulpy, it just doesn't adhere to a few pulp maxims closely enough. Meaning, there's too much fat on this mother (mummy)! Granted, it's a mass market paperback, but \"Fury From the Tomb\" is 441 pages \u2014 way yonder too long. Sidor should study some old Spider pulps, for instance; some of them didn't make much sense, but primary writer Norvell Page kept the action pulse-pounding and relentless (there are too many leisurely digressions here), and they sure as hell didn't come close to 400 pages.\"Fury,\" its story told first-person by Hardy, is amusing, exciting enough and has few truly weak stretches, though the climax is rather ordinary. It's the first of a series, but if Sidor wants me along for another ride, getting leaner is a must."}, {"userName": "Elaine Aldred", "userReviewDate": "May 05, 2018", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/10589376-elaine-aldred", "userReview": "It\u2019s 1888. A time when it was still possible to make wondrous discoveries of antiquities in ancient Egyptian tombs.When young Romulus Hugo Hardy sets forth to make his name in the world of Egyptology, little does he know what remarkable and terrifying events his uncovering of a booby-trapped tomb of an ancient sorcerer will set in motion.After surviving a near-death experience, Rom makes it to America with his cargo of mummies, only to have them stolen by individuals who are as unsavoury as the bevy of reanimated mummies which end up careering around Mexico hell bent on restoring their great leader to his former self.All that now stands between normality and an impending apocalypse are the hapless and na\u00efve archaeologist, a feisty young woman, an orphaned Chinese busboy and a gunslinger of very dubious character, but with a heart of gold.Fury From the Tomb is a full-on, red blooded assembly of dead things that should really be dead, but don\u2019t know how to lie down, necrotically-challenged ghouls, the really undead, and the living trying their damnedest to remain that way. In other words, the sort of thing you would sit down and gleefully watch at your local flea pit while your mates try to steal your oversized tub of horrifically sweet popcorn. S A Sidor takes all the cliches in this classic B-movie mashup, throws in a bit of Raiders of the Lost Ark, Nosferatu, The Mummy etc., then really goes to town on them.The action, in the form of a constant stream of fantastic perils which our heroes must extricate themselves from, is relentless.The narration of this escapade by Rom reveals him to be the type of pompous individual who cannot understand why his unusual take on Egyptology is not being appreciated by his peers. His attitude and physical capabilities in the role of a hero gradually change and develop during the telling of this outrageous hokum, largely because he is a gentleman and feels compelled to rescue the damsel in distress (who mostly gives a good showing of herself) and the defenceless orphan (who is remarkably stoic and worldly wise). Most of all, Rom\u2019s morality drives him to sort out the mess he feels responsible for.The characters work really well together as an ensemble cast because their interactions are great, making an effortless and constant shift from humorous to, literally, dead serious dialogue.Although this is a plot that leaves little to the imagination, you know that you, the reader, are there just to enjoy the ride. But for all that, take a good look at the quality of the writing, because it is far more sophisticated than the rattling good yarn would lead you believe. If the characters could be accused of clich\u00e9s (which they are, but deliberately and brilliantly so), the descriptions are priceless, \u201cDawn broke a hot runny egg across the horizon behind us\u201d. The dialogue is crafted with equally as much care.I\u2019m really looking forward to the next in the series, so bring it on. Meanwhile Fury From the Tomb is another in my comfort reads of the year.
