Is your doctor one of those who receives kickbacks from pharmaceutical companies? How dangerous are our hospitals for patients? Do the drug companies make drugs or money? Is vaccinating children the smart thing for parents to do? Do you know the medical tests that may kill you? Are cures really being suppressed? What\u2019s the solution regarding private health insurance? Who is quashing alternative medicines? When did your doctor last talk to you about your diet?\"A fascinating an informative read. A lot of research went into this book (on the topics mentioned above). It gives the reader some serious issues to think about. Some of the information I had already read about. Others I learned from this book.I have to say that I do agree with the authors on this topic, and feel that everyone is in control of their body. That everyone has the right to say no to treatment, tests, surgery, medications. Also I feel (along with the Authors) that if in doubt get a second opinion, maybe even a third.I am a Chronically ill person with an incurable disease (Crohn's) so MEDICAL INDUSTRIAL COMPLEX: The $ickness Industry, Big Pharma and Suppressed Cures hit \"close to home with me. I do admit that I always have done a lot of research before a procedure, surgery, medications, and have declined certain tests and medications. In doing so I did NOT offend my doctor. After all Doctors are people and it is their job to try to do the best they can to help a patient. Like all careers and businesses there are dishonest people, Doctors are not exempt from corruption, although most (in my experience) are honest and trust worthy.A very fascinating, thought-provoking and controversial read. I highly recommend to all (Especially American's)."}, {"userName": "Harry Whitewolf", "userReviewDate": "May 17, 2015", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/28206267-harry-whitewolf", "userReview": "One issue surely everyone agrees on is how important our health is. These days, thankfully, plenty of people are waking up to corruption in Big Pharma and other related wrongdoings, but there are still plenty of people who ain\u2019t, or don\u2019t know the details. Why? (Apart from it not being on the six o\u2019clock news,) because most books that deal with the subject are the size of a castle\u2019s doorstop- they\u2019re too big and you\u2019ll get around to them one day when you\u2019re not feeling so lazy.So- Medical Industrial Complex is the short solution! It contains all those major well known (for anyone who has read up on these things) factors as well as lots of incidents and info that you won\u2019t find elsewhere. It reads like a well informed and expertly crafted essay, but one that\u2019s written openly, honestly and passionately; succinctly spotlighting those areas that are of the utmost importance -as the authors\u2019 list: \u201cHuman guinea pigs / Medical fraud / Political ambitions superseding the health of the people / Suppressing cancer cures / Health insurers screwing customers / Toxic immunizations for children / Big Pharma making money at all costs / Hospital misadventures / Doctors receiving kickbacks / Overprescribing of prescription drugs / Sinking natural health products in a sea of red tape etc. etc.\u201dBuy this book for people who don\u2019t read books about this stuff. They might join the rest of us in realising we need to make some changes in our health care systems. And fast.(It also gets a bonus point for quoting The Psychedelic Furs.)"}, {"userName": "Lisa Norris", "userReviewDate": "Jan 25, 2016", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/10286218-lisa-norris", "userReview": "It is easy to get swallowed up by the complexity of words used by doctors, nurses, or other health personnel, because we don\u2019t have the scientific understanding of what is going on with our bodies and how treatments affect us.The internet is there for us to look up more information we can possibly handle, and often the advice and sometimes statements, that are written as facts, contradict each other. The authors make us aware of that there are other interests at stake than that of the patient, such as money\u2026.the health industry is no exception to the corruptions that exists in pretty much every field in the world at the present time or in the past\u2026.and most likely any future field as well.This book helps put much of the information out there into perspective. It\u2019s not telling us what to think or what to do but rather making us aware of the information out there so we can make better sense of it all and feel more power within our own choices.Having a better understanding that there are ulterior motives, should encourage us to second guess or at least look deeper into the understanding of our own health and how to best take care of our physical and mental health without needing to rely on the medical industry\u2026.and if you do need the assistance, don\u2019t hesitate to look for second or third opinions\u2026.this book is a great guideline of what to look for or what to question when it comes to this industry."}, {"userName": "Remy Benoit", "userReviewDate": "May 29, 2015", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/10501290-remy-benoit", "userReview": "As an historian it has always fascinated me that robber barons of the latter 1800's who built their fortunes on sweated laborers forced to live in filthy, rat infested, overcrowded tenements, or company towns with no health insurance, disability, etc. were regarded as philanthropists when they built museums.Obviously, profit is the underlying cornerstone of capitalism, but day by day the question arises as to how much profit, at what cost, is acceptable.I am currently absolutely pleased with my doctors\u2014heart surgeon, GP, eye surgeon, and gastroenterologist\u2014I truly couldn't ask for more professional or caring individuals who are there for me, literally in life saving moments. Previous to them, a misdiagnosis of cold weather asthma, when it was a serious heart condition where my life nearly ended in my driveway, was, obviously, not a high point of experience.To assure ability to pay for their services of the above dedicated people, besides Medicare, I pay high health insurance costs; have a retiree pharmacy plan, etc.Those things being said in respect to those who so deserve it, I am quite well aware of serious problems in the health care industry, not only from my own physical problems, but from care taking for terminal patients.When I look at the costs of medications, prior to my pharmacy plan kicking in, I know, without doubt, that without the insurance, there is no possible way I could afford the prescriptions; nor could I, without the health insurance, even imagine paying for the hospital, doctor, ambulance, and yes, even chopper ride to the emergency room. The cost of just the first heart attack visit to the ER and surgery was more than the market value of my home! This unrelenting attack on \u201cObamacare\u201d is sickening, waged by those who can afford health care even without insurance. When one hospital visit can literally indenture you and your family for life, it is more than obvious that we have a serious problem.Medications, as so well addressed by the Morcans, pose their own predicaments. One for cholesterol physically disabled me, caused serious pain. This particular drug has been under litigation for years, and is still being sold. When I read through the list of ingredients the Morcans provided in vaccinations, it read as a list of toxic poisons we would never even consider even having in our homes, all rolled into one injection to keep our children\u2014healthy? The ultimate oxymoron. One has to ask is it necessary to include these toxins which seem scraped off the floor of some abattoir that has been left smoldering in our Louisiana heat and humidity for decades before being harvested. Are they there to be less costly fillers? Is there any acceptable reason for the used?Is it righteous business to change some simple ingredient in a medication to label it as 'new, improved, and super effective' and charge an absurd amount for it? Or to do that to present a \u201cnew\u201d drug when it is just a redo of one under litigation?Kickbacks, grants, travel, lecture fees, vacations\u2014are these acceptable and how much do they impact on the care and medications doctors prescribe?Just how does the fact that medications from plants can't be patented impact R&D, motivation, profits, attacks on alternate medicine?Does big pharma, do doctors, hospitals, rely too much on maintenance, reduction of symptoms, rather than cures? How would they make money if patients came in and were cured?Lance and James Morcan present you with questions, professional opinions, insights that you need to consider on many levels before you submit to a surgery, fill a prescription, choose a doctor. Millions are spent on advertising medications that will allegedly help you with ailments, yet with the concomitant \u201cpossible side effects\u201d of anything from rashes, liver and kidney problems, strokes, lymphomas (notice lack of the \u201cc\u201d word), multiple hours of arousal\u2014the lists go on at length. There are serious moral implications in pushing medicines with such extreme \u201cside effects\u201d when there is, as the Morcans point out, the temptation of doctors taking kick backs for prescribing medications.The authors help you be pro-active rather than being reactive and just swallowing the next pill; submitting to the next knife; accepting what is offered rather than evaluating it for yourself.Alternative medicine is explored and the question is raised:How many plants are being unnecessarily synthesized and sold over the counter as wonder drugs to an unsuspecting public? Why can't we use natural \u201cmedicines\u201d like quinine bark instead of chemically produced one\u2014perhaps because you can't patent plants, and thus so limit profits? What if the real plant is better at curing?The Morcans further address our children's health and how so many are being drugged to \u201ccalm\u201d them, to cope with ADD for which many have never really been tested. Perhaps we should be looking at the curricula that are tuned to the test; to endless regurgitation of \u201ccovered\u201d materials with no room for what I call the Three C's: Compassion, Communication, and Creativity. This \u201cassembly line\u201d education as I have been calling it for decades needs to be addressed, changed, to inspire young people to learn without drugs to \u201ckeep them in line,\u201d \u201cto help them.\u201d This book explores the drugs they are being given; the socio-economics of drugging children; the reasons provided for so doing.Patient: you can help to heal yourself, your family, if you open your eyes to how the current \u201csystem\u201d works, not just allegedly for you, but often to your detriment. That is the message of this important expose offered here. And do ask questions about your medications, treatments, and also about whether cures have been suppressed by pharmaceutical companies, or maybe even governments. Consider the financial losses for medical treatments if there was a simple cure for cancer. Parkinsons, heart disease, diabetes, etc.A must read, for yourself, for your family, for a truly acceptable first steps to a so needed cradle to grave universal health care system\u2014and that should include the legislators who need to be reminded big time that they work for you, not corporations.Once again this hard hitting, and seemingly tireless, father and son team ask you to ask the hard questions\u2014questions they so terrifically introduced in their stirring Orphan Trilogy on this topic and so many others to spark thought and exchange of ideas. Do join them on Goodreads to join the discussions! They give all due credit to the hundreds of thousands of those involved in medicine who truly care about your health. As in all else, politics, profits, religion, greed, and a hundred other factors infiltrate the medical profession. The bottom line, the clich\u00e9, as usual is to follow the money and also to find out what you are agreeing to make part of your life and well being.And while you are exploring, researching, ask the all so important question: Why does the US not have cradle to grave insurance for all when it would not impoverish the country? Why are we agreeing to pay thousands a year out of pocket for insurance, for co-pays, when other countries provide this decent, civilized care? What are we discussing with our doctors about nutrition, GMO's, fertilizers, pesticides? Read along with the Morcan men as they raise questions to which you need answers about those things, about alternative medical treatments, supplements. Traditional drugs don't get approved by the FDA unless they seemingly do their appointed jobs, but why are we so accepting of lines of \u201cpossible side effects\u201d that can be life threatening, or in the case of one drug, possibly lead to \u201cpromiscuity.\u201d Just what every parent wants for their child.Would drug companies use humans as guinea pigs for drugs\u2014a serious question also raised by the Morcans.To be well, choose well. This is a great book to get you started to asking the important questions."}, {"userName": "Pennie", "userReviewDate": "May 27, 2015", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/27545499-pennie", "userReview": "Father and son team Lance and James Morcan have to be my favorite authors of both fiction and non fiction books. I've read just about everything they have ever written with \"Orphan Conspiracy Theories' being one of my own personal favorites. Born in New Zealand, this talented duo have wrote/produced numerous books but it doesn't stop there - James is also a well known actor that has starred in such titles as one of their own books 'Fiji'.Their production company 'Morcan Motion Pictures' has produced 'The Ninth Orphan' and 'Fiji' in to feature length films. His father 'Lance Morcan' is also a novelist/screenwriter, and producer of their books and film production company. Two extremely talented and very busy authors come together once again to write 'Medical Industrial Complex' one of their newest additions of their publishing agenda and 'The Underground Knowledge Series - BOOK 3. Here, they question and discuss in depth, medical ailments with various conflicting issues that surround the medical field. Definitely not a book to be missed and I give it a 5 star review."}, {"userName": "Tony Sunderland", "userReviewDate": "Aug 19, 2016", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/56839604-tony-sunderland", "userReview": "Investigative journalism used to be one of the essential pillars that kept Western society both honest and accountable to its citizens. Unfortunately, the profession has been decimated by the demise of the printed newspaper. James and lance Morcan have reconceptualised news and story to create a new hybrid genre that delivers both crucial information and a narrative that engages readers with personal perspective. There is a Medical /Industrial complex and the Morcans give us proof of its existence and reasons why it has such a strong foothold in our society that is aging and affluent. I highly recommend this book for anyone who wants to empower themself with information to on how the health system really works."}, {"userName": "Yvonne Crowe", "userReviewDate": "Jun 11, 2015", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/15153115-yvonne-crowe", "userReview": "It is time to take responsibility for our healthcare decisionsThis book is long overdue and it took the talent of Lance, a journalist, and James Morcan to bring it into being. The amount of exhaustive research that has gone into uncovering and assembling the facts about the Medical industrial complex is evident.Pharmaceutics is big business and the profits are enormous. Unfortunately the emphasis in the Medical profession is on sickness, rather than wellness and preventiveness.I have often wondered why drugs are so expensive and the answer has always been how much research and development costs. Hmmm compare that with the inexpensive and highly effective Indian herbal products I have used over the past eight years to recover from a serious illness without any injurious side effects, and keep me healthy when all other avenues failed. When I contracted breast cancer I turned down medical intervention and used an inexpensive natural herbal therapy instead. It worked a treat. Billions of $$$$$$ are poured into research for a cancer cure when there are healthier alternatives.So I can attest to the truthful statements in this book that is endeavouring to enlighten the gullible and the fearful. Today medical treatment revolves around a prescription for drugs, some with nasty side effects. No wonder we have bred a pleasure seeking pill popping culture that kills. It is time to get off the treadmill.Make a wise choice and read this book into which so much time and energy has been expended. Question where your tax dollar is going and why our health systems worldwide are in such dire straits that people are paying into private health insurance; and ask yourself who are behind these schemes. The Morcans have done it so the rest of us can stop perpetuating this unhealthy situation."}, {"userName": "Andrew", "userReviewDate": "May 29, 2015", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/4121395-andrew", "userReview": "Thought provoking and to the point.

Written by novelists, filmmakers and independent researchers James Morcan & Lance Morcan, with a foreword by retired pharmacist Denis Toovey (author of Better Health for You: An Insider's Big Picture Guide), this explosive book explores the contention that Big Pharma and other participants in the healthcare sector put profits ahead of patients\u2019 wellbeing and dollars ahead of lives. MEDICAL INDUSTRIAL COMPLEX leaves no doubt that something has run amuck in the medical field, and what should be the noblest profession has been severely compromised by the various conflicting interests. The authors examine this in language anyone can understand. In the process, they draw attention to the rampant commercialism, political selfishness and dogmatic academia that plagues the industry. The reader is reminded there are many honorable people within the medical establishment who are doing incredible things for their fellow Man. However, the reader is also reminded that doctors, hospitals, medical academia, pharmaceutical companies, medical equipment suppliers, health insurers et al make their money from sick people, not healthy people, and if everyone was healthy many of the aforementioned would be out of business\u2026so it\u2019s hardly in their financial interests to cure illnesses and ailments. MEDICAL INDUSTRIAL COMPLEX asks some hard questions. Questions like: Is your doctor one of those (doctors) who receives kickbacks from pharmaceutical companies? How dangerous are our hospitals for patients? Do the drug companies make drugs or money? Is vaccinating children the smart thing for parents to do? Do you know the medical tests that may kill you? Are cures really being suppressed? What\u2019s the solution regarding private health insurance? Who is quashing alternative medicines? When did your doctor last talk to you about your diet? Above all the reader is urged to stop giving away complete responsibility to doctors and other healthcare providers. \u201cIt\u2019s time to start looking at these people as they actually are: advisors for YOU to make decisions about what\u2019s best for YOUR body.\u201d", "title": "MEDICAL INDUSTRIAL COMPLEX: The $ickness Industry, Big Pharma and Suppressed Cures\n      \n          (The Underground Knowledge Series #3)", "url": "http://www.goodreads.com/book/show/25393264-medical-industrial-complex", "average": 4.18, "cover": "https://images.gr-assets.com/books/1429516794l/25393264.jpg", "reviews": 14, "authors": [{"url": "https://www.goodreads.com/author/show/5099266.James_Morcan", "name": "James Morcan"}, {"url": "https://www.goodreads.com/author/show/5099267.Lance_Morcan", "name": "Lance Morcan"}, {"url": "https://www.goodreads.com/author/show/11878252.Denis_Toovey", "name": "Denis Toovey"}], "type": ["Nonfiction", "Health", "Health", "Science", "Social Movements"], "outlinks": ["http://www.goodreads.com/book/show/25393264-medical-industrial-complex", "http://www.goodreads.com/book/show/35080478-complejo-m-dico-industrial", "http://www.goodreads.com/book/show/36410582-complesso-industriale-medico", "http://www.goodreads.com/book/show/22914170-the-ninth-orphan", "http://www.goodreads.com/book/show/25418689-the-orphan-factory", "http://www.goodreads.com/book/show/23782190-genius-intelligence", "http://www.goodreads.com/book/show/25419228-the-orphan-uprising", "http://www.goodreads.com/book/show/30975049-the-orphan-trilogy"]}
