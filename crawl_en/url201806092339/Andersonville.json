It changed my life. I was living a fairly middle class suburban life and couldn't believe that people could be treated the way people in this book were treated. It was not so much an anti-war book for me as an anti-humanity book. People could not do the things that were described here to other people. Not possible. It would be impossible for humans to suffer like that. I had had a limited experience of the South. My family had driven from Michigan to the Gulf Coast in Florida for warm Easter vacations. This was before the Interstates were completed so we drove some stretches through the South on the blue highways. We saw glimpses of poverty and segregation. But Andersonville was on a highway like none I had ever experienced or imagined.This book introduced me to experiences that I could barely fathom. It showed me what a safe little world I inhabited and thought was normal. I had had duck 'n' cover in the hallways of my elementary school, had heard a little about the holocaust and Hiroshima. But Andersonville started to actually put some real tarnish on the shiny world that I thought I inhabited.Listening to the Audible version many years later.August 18, 2017The book begins with ira wondering his land early of a morning. Ira is familiar with the land and with the flora in the fauna. Listening to him think about the plants and animals is quite enjoyable. He is probably 50 and has several slaves that help him farm the land. He had three sons but two are already dead in the water and one still serves. As he enjoys his solitude in the country A small party appears, soldiers and surveyors. They are searching out a site to be a prison for union soldiers. As they ride off ira hope they will not choose his land.I am amazed to find myself at the beginning of chapter 7 and still amidst the details prior to the development of Andersonville.I continue to progress through the Audible book up to chapter 24 now. Descriptions of the prison camp with a population of over 10,000 are somewhat horrifying although The book is actually still dominated by descriptions of individuals, often their lives prior to the Civil War and their imprisonment.There are now 22,000 prisoners in Andersonville. The commandant of the prison is of German dissent and still speaks German frequently. This is an interesting addition to the Audible format. He is presented with a strange combination of characteristics: both cruelty but also a desire to make the prison a better facility. The outer wall of the stockade is made with 22 foot tree trunks buried five or 6 feet into the ground and rising approximately 15 feet into the air. At one point the size of the stockade was increased creating about 760 feet of logs that would be removed and could be reused. The commandant had many plans for this lumber but he got up one morning and found that the prisoners had removed the logs themselves by hand and made many improvements in their living conditions with the wood.There are now 33,000 prisoners in Andersonville. Apparently many of them are Catholic as evidenced by the stories of the Catholic priest who serves the community. It sometimes takes a strong stomach to read the descriptions of the smells of Andersonville. Human waste and rotting bodies both dead and alive. The prison camp could be smelled 2 miles away.Andersonville: \"a stench in the nostrils of history.\" The neighbors of the camp whom we met earlier in the book did on occasion try to improve the circumstances of the prisoners. They brought food that was surplus from their farms. This food was used for those who worked at the camp but not allowed to be distributed to the prisoners. After several reports about the extraordinarily poor conditions were ignored by Richmond, one neighbor set out on a perilous journey to Richmond as the war was drawing to a conclusion and the south was in some chaos.Coral is an 18-year-old confederate who has lost a foot in the war. He comes across a 20-year-old Union soldier who has escaped from Andersonville with a lost hand. This unlikely pair become friends in a touching story at the end of the book. A confederate father who had lost three sons joins them at the end as they manufacture a peg leg for the lost foot. And then the Union soldier heads off seeking freedom and having found unlikely friendship. This story might just make the whole book worthwhile.Andersonville existed for 19 months and at one time held as many as 33,000 union prisoners although it was initially intended for only 10,000. It achieved a certain infamy has 14,000 soldiers died there. This book is filled with horror and humanity. The book begins and ends with the man who owned the land where the 27 acre stockade was constructed. He owned slaves and loved nature and felt himself to be a decent man. There is also the story of captain Wirtz who was the commandant of Andersonville and tried he thought to run a good facility even though he was never given the supplies and resources he needed do I send more prisoners then he could handle. He thought he was a good and kind person who followed orders.This book was published in 1955 and the audible version which I just listened to was recorded 60 years later."}, {"userName": "Susan", "userReviewDate": "Mar 25, 2017", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/5837456-susan", "userReview": "I will admit that I have very little knowledge of American history, including the American Civil War. As a reader, I have found that historical fiction is a good place to begin when you are starting out to investigate a subject and \u201cAndersonville,\u201d seemed to come up again and again in lists of novels which best explore, and explain, the Civil War. It is a huge book (not available in kindle in the UK, so this is really a door-stopper of a novel), standing at over 750 pages and with an enormous cast of characters. The author does an incredible job of setting the scene, as we begin with plantation owner, Ira Claffey, and are gradually introduced to his family and neighbours. Ira has lost three sons to the war, his wife is descending into deep depression and his daughter, Lucy, has seen the man she was to marry also killed. Ira Claffey is a slave owner; yet, paradoxically, he also sees himself as a good man. His family, his whole way of life is under threat, and yet he views himself as a benevolent father figure and is concerned that, if his slaves are given freedom, they will be unable to care for themselves. Throughout this book, we see how Ira\u2019s views change and we witness events from the point of view of many of his household and his neighbours. These include a poor, white family, named the Tebbs; including \u2018Widow Tebbs\u2019 who flagrantly makes her living from the attentions of the many men who visit her shabby house, and her tribe of children.Near the beginning of this novel, Ira is approached by men looking for a site in which to keep Yankee prisoners. This is the beginning of Camp Sumter, which will become known as the notorious \u201cAndersonville,\u201d prison camp. Henry Wirz is the German speaking superintendant of the stockade, who suffers constantly from a wound in his arm and is unable to muster respect from either his superiors, so relies on hatred and fear to rule. There is also the bookish medic, Harrell Elkins, who knew Ira Claffey\u2019s sons and is concerned at what he sees in the building of the camp.Indeed, there is not really any building at all \u2013 other than a stockade. There is no shelter from rain, or sun. No attempt to make the camp liveable or provide reasonable conditions for the prisoners herded inside the walls. This means that, certainly at the beginning, the fittest survive and the weakest find themselves at the mercy of those able to physically attack and abuse them. With rations infrequent and insufficient, no shelter, sickness rife and a lack of leadership, the place descends into a living hell. Meanwhile, locals, like Claffey become aware of what is going on and struggle with their consciences at seeing their \u2018enemies\u2019 so degraded. This is a book which requires commitment and time to read. There are endless characters and stories from both inside, and outside, the camp. We are introduced to the \u2018raiders\u2019 who control the camp, such as Willie Collins. There is the cultured, Jewish prisoner, Nathan Dreyfoos and the man who befriends him, Seneca MacBean. Eben who loved birds and Father Peter Shelen who ministers to the dead and dying. There is bravery, defiance, horror and shame, as the men suffer and die, and yet keep arriving to suffer and die\u2026One of the things which really interested me about this novel were how many of those involved were first generation immigrants. Nathan Dreyfoos, for example, does not consider even joining the war until a chance encounter causes him to join up. Many of those involved are German (including Wirz), Irish, or from a whole host of other countries. As such, we hear their back stories and what led them to this point and also of the despair, and the futility, that those outside the stockade feel as the horror of the camp unfolds. It is also interesting that the author mentions that Ira Claffey and his family can actually \u2018smell\u2019 the camp from their house, and has parallels perhaps with people in small towns near concentration camps, in the Second World War, who denied any knowledge of what unfolded so close to where they live. For it is apparent that people talk and gossip, and that Claffey, and his neighbours, are obviously interested; going to view the initial building, going to witness the first prisoners arrive and have a more obviously human interest in what is going on so close to them which is much more believable. It is also clear that what they see eventually shocks them to the core.Events at Andersonville will change the people involved, and may change you as a reader. This is a novel which is vast in scope and which I am glad I have read. I feel it did give me some understanding of (some, at least) of the events in the American Civil War. Although it is an uncomfortable read, for much of the time, it was a rewarding one and I am glad that I finally got around to reading it \u2013 having meant to do so for a long time."}, {"userName": "Jay", "userReviewDate": "Apr 08, 2011", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/3538579-jay", "userReview": "I am curious how a work enters the Contemporary Canon. Who or what decides if any given literary piece survives beyond its publication as some type of icon, valued for its uniqueness or literary strength? And indeed, how is \u201cuniqueness\u201d determined or defined and by whom?McKinley Kantor\u2019s \u201cAndersonville\u201d was a hit in the wake of its publication in 1955. It won the Pulitzer Prize in 1956; was a Book-of-the-Month Club selection, was well-reviewed and long remained on the best seller list. I remember when it came into our house as a hardcover that prominently weighted our bookshelf after my parents devoured it and invited extended discussions about the Civil War. It was Kantor\u2019s masterpiece, prepared over 25 years of research and investigation. Bruce Catton called it \"the best Civil War novel I have ever read.\"Although it long enjoyed both popularity and financial success in the wake of its publication, my sense is that it is not considered today as a part of the Contemporary Canon. It certainly does not figure in any of the more common lists of notable fiction from the XX Century and I would be surprised to find it listed in a major bibliography of selected, fiction works dealing with the Civil War.Perhaps one reason why it has slipped into oblivion is that its structure is antithetical to contemporary tastes. The current age is mesmerized by hagiographies infrequently written by professional historians. In both histories and historical novels, preferences run to a central figure whose actions or inactions thread dominantly through the work. Biographies, for example, of the Founding Fathers are today\u2019s rage. In \u201cAndersonville\u201d, there is no central figure outside the prison itself. The plantation owner, Ira Claffey, opens and closes the novel, but he does not control the action. Rather, the work is a collection of vignettes of a large number of ordinary people (some historical but most fictional) of whom Claffey is merely one. It resembles more closely the work of the social historians who might seem uninterested in sketching for the reader a broader narrative synthesis and thus are less attractive to the general public.There is also the length of the novel. At 760 word-packed pages, it probably tries the patience of readers who prefer tighter editing. Also, several reviewers have been negatively critical of Kantor\u2019s failure to mark dialogue clearly. Exposition and conversation run together, without identifying punctuation, causing frustration and confusion among some readers.Yet, although the novel may have escaped a place among the XX Century American Canon, it is still an engaging and informative read, stylistically strong. It captures in effortless prose the Nation toward the latter part of the armed conflict when the Union\u2019s defeat of the Confederacy is all too apparent as are the horrors of the unexpectedly lengthy war.Andersonville the prison, run by the Confederacy to hold captured Union soldiers, is the scene of human depravity both inside the stockade and outside. And Kantor captures that depravity in its full dimension. You see it, feel it, hear it, taste it and smell it. During the 14 months of its existence (1864-1865), more than 45,000 Union soldiers were confined there and some 13,000 died, wasted away from starvation, exposure to the elements, overcrowding and disease.In Kantor\u2019s telling, death stalks life; the strong pray on the weak; humanity is redefined without redemption; indifference replaces compassion. It is the story of ordinary people mutating into animals during uncommon times.Although Andersonville prison\u2014its community of guards, prisoners and neighbors\u2014is the focal point of the novel, Kantor gives each of the people he highlights deep histories. His people come from rural and urban roots: farmers, landowners, artisans, professionals, slaves, vagabonds, seamen, ruffians and hooligans, traders and merchants. In their composite, they and their families are a microcosm of American society of the 1860s, mutilated and depressed by the barbarity of war.While evil infuses the novel, it is not a hopeless world. Some humanity does survive. A physician labors to alleviate suffering even though his efforts are inadequate and unsuccessful; a handful of prisoners organize an internal policing effort to permanently stop a cadre of bullies and thugs (fellow prisoners themselves) from wanton exploitation. Toward the end of the novel, an escaped prisoner is befriended by one of the prison guards, forming, in the process, an ultimately deeply emotional and liberating friendship. But the examples of humanity and civility only underscore the basic brutality of Andersonville and, ultimately, of the Civil War itself."}, {"userName": "Anastasia Fitzgerald-Beaumont", "userReviewDate": "Dec 12, 2010", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/3044221-anastasia-fitzgerald-beaumont", "userReview": "Try to imagine a place worse than Dachau. It\u2019s impossible, you say. Then imagine, if you will, Dachau just as overcrowded but without the huts, without a clean water supply, without any kind of sanitation; just a palisade with watchtowers around an open field. Imagine people, thousands of people, suffering in confined conditions under an open sky, winter and summer, the only source of water being a marshy stream which rapidly turns into a sewer, a breeding ground for maggots and disease. This is not Germany; this is not Dachau. This is America; this is Andersonville.Thanks to Ike Jakson, a fellow blogger, I\u2019ve read Andersonville, the 1955 Pulitzer Prize winning novel by MacKinlay Kantor. It\u2019s set during the American Civil War, for the most part in and around Andersonville, a prisoner of war camp near the town of Anderson in Georgia, which opened in February 1864. In just over twenty-six acres thousands of Union prisoners were penned as in a zoo, with no shelter other than their own rough shebangs, holes dug in the ground, covered with blankets or coats propped up with sticks. In the year or so it was open an estimated 45 thousand men passed through its gates; almost 13 thousand never passed out again, other than to the grave, dead of malnutrition, neglect, malaria, diarrhoea, scurvy and gangrene.Andersonville is a powerful novel, one of the most powerful I\u2019ve ever read, and I say that without a trace of exaggeration. Kantor spent years on background research, evidenced in his writing, material he handles with ease, fully digested, unlike so many other historical novels. It could, given the subject, have been an angry book, a bleak book, but it\u2019s not; it\u2019s a book full of gentle understanding and humanity. There are parts that are difficult to read, there is real horror, but there is nothing lurid, nothing overstated in Kantor\u2019s treatment.It\u2019s a mixture of fact and fiction, a mixture of real people and wholly believable characters: unforgettable characters like Ira Claffey and his daughter Lucy, who live on a plantation close to the camp, and Nathan Dreyfoos, a cultured man, a Union prisoner, carried to Andersonville by chance and fate. There are others, large and small, people the author takes from their homes and guides them through his pages, sometimes invisible, other times not. It\u2019s a story, in so many ways, of intersected lives and intersected destinies.In Dachau the Nazis imposed a brutish order, with guards in the camp and designated block orderlies. In Andersonville, or Camp Sumter, to give its official name, there was no order or policing. The authorities stayed outside for the most part, allowing the prisoners to manage the best they could. The worst was a kind of jungle, a Darwinian struggle of the strong against the weak.For me this was the most depressing part of the story, that predatory gangs known as Raiders organised themselves to steal from their already impoverished comrades, not stopping short of murder. This is not fiction; this really happened and it continued to happen until other prisoners formed their own police force, the Regulators, imposing a kind of order in the midst of misery. The order went so far as trying and condemning the leaders of the Raiders, a process carried out with the cooperation of the camp authorities.The authority, the person with immediate responsibility for Andersonville, was one Captain Henry Wirz, of Swiss German origin, the only person convicted and executed after the Civil War of what we now refer to as war crimes. Kantor does not condemn him, no; he merely presents him as a self-pitying, ineffectual and rather wretched little man, an obvious scapegoat. His greater culprit is General John H Winder,responsible for the whole of the Confederate prison system, depicted as a callous and brutish individual who, along with his son, is alleged to have deliberately engineered death by neglect.It\u2019s as well to remember, though, that Andersonville is a novel, not a history. In the spirit of poetic licence some liberties are taken with the facts. There is not the least doubt about the callous indifference with which many of the Confederate authorities perceived the Union prisoners, but the camp opened at a time when the Southern state itself was dying; at a time when supply was breaking down, when shortages were commonplace; a time when even soldiers in the field went hungry. This is not to excuse what happened at Andersonville, to excuse the dehumanisation, merely to offer a wider understanding.Of the dozens of novels I\u2019ve read this year Andersonville is by far the best, only equalled by Vassily Grossman\u2019s Life and Fate, by coincidence another account set against a background of war. Kantor writes in a lucid and compelling fashion, a narrative that quickly engages and carries one along. He writes in a wholly believable way about wholly believable people. Some books are instantly forgettable, no matter how enjoyable. This is a book that cannot be forgotten, one destined to leave a perpetual afterimage in my mind."}, {"userName": "Tracy Shapley", "userReviewDate": "Aug 28, 2010", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/1857873-tracy-shapley", "userReview": "This book was ridiculously awful.The worst part was how, for the first 50 pages or so, I thought it was going to be super bad ass awesome. It was about a southern town (Anderson) where a prison was built during the civil war. The first chapter was about the family whose land was taken by the rebels in order to build this prison. The characters were rich, engaging and conflicted.However, it turned out that basically every chapter is full of new people. There was a very small continuing plot line, but for the most part it was disjointed tellings of the atrocities in this prison. Incredibly graphic passages abounded, and while I did care in that \"I care that any human was treated this way,\" kind of way, I did not care in an, \"I know and care about this character specifically,\" kind of way.Also, Kantor felt the need to not include any quotation marks in the book. Half the time I didn't even realize someone was talking until halfway through their speech. Not cool my friend. Not cool.I actually only made it about 750 pages into this 900+ page book. Typically I will finish a book no matter what, but when there is no real continuing plot and I hated it as much as I did, I didn't really see a purpose.The author clearly did his research, and wanted to include every morsel of it, and I can see why Civil War buffs might care about this book. It was not for me though."}, {"userName": "Kirk Smith", "userReviewDate": "Oct 05, 2014", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/15749169-kirk-smith", "userReview": "Historical novels are, without question, the best way of teaching history, for they offer the human stories behind the events and leave the reader with a desire to know more. This is a 5 star that I rate lower to discourage other readers. Looking through a reversed telescope at a prisoner of war camp, in fact a true death camp, is probably a subject for few readers. There is no glory of war in this book. It seems to be a true and accurate depiction of the worst War and human endeavors can produce. MacKinlay Kantor's writing is fluid and genius. There is also fortunately equal representation of the goodness and generosity of humankind or this book would be pure torture. As a historical novel: brilliant.

It wasn't a terrible book, and I read all of it, which probably puts me in the minority. It was just sort of blah. As Agnes Mack said, there were so many characters that none of them ever become especially memorable. There are other problems. While this book is not as racist as GONE WITH THE WIND, Kantor still takes a very tolerant view of slavery. All the slaveowners in the book are benign and enlightened, which is the oldest of Southern lies. One even brags that he whipped a male slave for beating his wife -- bet that didn't happen very often. There are no Abolitionist Yankees, no black runaways, no-one to challenge the Southern view. Oddly enough, the main conflict in the book is between the native Anglo-Saxon Yankee prisoners, and the \"criminal\" element. Kantor portrays the bad Yankees as 100% Irish, Catholic, and urban. While he certainly has the Irish gangster stereotype down pat, it would have been nice to see a few loyal Irish soldiers. At the very least, the evil Irish mob boss could have been more up front about their real reason for hating the war -- that is, hatred of the blacks competing for their jobs. In the end, though, the book is so bland it's not even offensive when it's totally dishonest. GONE WITH THE WIND is hateful in many ways -- but it's never boring.

(Probably in real life as in the novel).

Andersonville, the Pultizer Prize winning work of historical fiction written by MacKinlay Kantor, seemed a natural choice for my new interest in that period of American History. Having visited the Andersonville Prisoner of War Camp in South Georgia years ago, I already knoew a little about the horrors the Union soldiers suffered there.Open for only 18 months, 52,000 Yankees were \"housed\" (although not my idea of housing) at this notorious POW camp known as Ft. Sumter and 13,000 of the soldiers died there. The 27 acre camp was surrounded by a stockade made of pine logs with a small creek that ran through the center. The residents had no shelter, except for makeshift tents for those who had the resources. This meant the prisoners had to suffer through intense heat in the Georgia summer, rain, and the cold of Georgia winter's with no defense. The creek became a combination of bathing, toileting, drinking, and disease. The men were given little or no fresh meat or vegetables and scant food in general. They suffered scurvy, gangrene, diarrhea, dysentery and various other life threating/ending diseases. The author begins the book describing the account (fictitious) of the residents who live in this sleepy Southern town. Soon follows the building of the POW camp. After that, the author devotes each chapter to describing the residents of the POW camp. He begins the chapter with a background of the residents and brings each to their current condition in the camp. Some of his characters are based on fact as some soldiers left behind diaries. At the end of the book, as a reference, the author writes about some of the true characters, which I referred to as I was reading the book. He writes with such imagination and description of the characters and I found this stunning.

The soldiers there suffered a nightmare existence, a large percentage dying of disease, starvation, or exposure - not because of malice on the part of the Southern authorities for the most part, but simply because of incompetence and indifference. After the war the commanding officer of the camp was tried for what would now be termed crimes against humanity and hanged, but in the name of justice several people above him in the chain of command probably should also have been prosecuted, because he had made some efforts to improve things - though not enough effort - but had not gotten much support from those to whom he reported.

The novel, set in Confederate Georgia, is about the infamous Andersonville prison. What I knew prior to reading the book was that it was large, crowded and most of the inmates died there from disease. I learned so much from this amazing work of historical fiction.Kantor cleverly introduces you to characters in their home setting first. You get to know them and care for them, and them follow them on their journey into captivity. You feel their pain when they must sell some of their belongings for necessaries, before they even set foot in Andersonville. You cringe, when upon arrival, they are attacked by gangs of thugs for their last few possessions. You shake your head in disgust, as the rations are too small, and unfit for consumption anyway. And finally, you weep when each poor man meets his end.It is really done so well. The prose, the introspection, and the stories that make sure you will never forget what took place in Andersonville Prison. It is heartbreaking and haunting, but it is also strangely uplifting. Kantor does not neglect to feed his readers a sense of hope, as he connects the characters in the book. He makes sure you understand that there is no North and South; no right and wrong in this war.

This is a caliber of novel which has essentially disappeared from our national literature. Contemporary readers can't handle something like this. No one today has the patience. No one would sit still long enough to travel back in time, to the American Civil War. They wouldn't stand for it. The rewards of tackling a novel this vast are assured; but admittedly, this is a difficult book. You need to rise to meet the challenge. 'Andersonville' can be very ponderous, lugubrious, and slow-moving; it is introspective; it deals with vanished seas of thought and feeling in American life. It is chock-full with the unfamiliar and the never-before-treated. You will knit your brow--pause--and squint--very often during its length. Certain paragraphs take several re-readings. But it is your responsibility to measure up. Kantor will not hold your hand with footnotes or asides. He expects you to keep up with him (audiences were entirely capable of this, at one time).'Andersonville' dwells on the most minute and plodding detail of setting, wardrobe, habit, and speech, for its timeperiod. In the course of this sweeping work of history, you will learn what songs were hummed in the Civil War era, what scripture people commonly quoted to one another. What poems they recited. You will learn all about Abraham Lincoln-era diseases, weapons, cannons, sabers, farming techniques, locomotive trains. How Americans drew their drinking water, raised vegetables, how they washed; how they slept; how they ran their households; how they managed livestock. You will discover what medicine they relied on, what food they ate, what utensils they ate with, what they carried in their pockets, what shoes they wore; how they rigged their horses and oxen. This is the overwhelming fabric which is woven into this story. It's enormous and staggering. Its not too much to say that this is one of the all-time greatest feats of descriptive prose you will ever encounter. Technically speaking: Kantor has some ingenious narrative tricks I've rarely--if ever seen done. Chapter after chapter--he switches POV from one character to another; shifts from one setting to another; one conversation to another; one voice to another; one flow of thought to another--sometimes all in the space of one page. Its beautifully handled. Fluid and confident authorship.There are many passages of stark, somber, pastoral beauty. Other parts are rib-bustingly funny, hoot-out-loud hilarious. Other parts will turn you green and make you queasy. Kantor will take you to the filthiest tenement in pre-Tweed Manhattan; to dusty wagon roads in Ohio; then to a battlefield in Tennessee, then a railway bridge in Lousiana, then a general store in Pennsylvania, then to a Bible meeting in Massachussets, then to an ironclad warship off the coast of Richmond.All of these places are filled-to-overflowing with conversation and incident. Women in hoopskirts; men in uniforms; whiskers and beards everywhere. Tykes in britches and ministers in frock-coats; doctors, butchers, muleskinners, gravediggers, drovers, farriers, ostlers, carters, fieldhands, prison guards, prostitutes, sailors. Bullies, braggarts, weaklings, cheats, sneaks. It is a slice of our world at the time in question.Also I must remark that 'Andersonville' is one of the great 'food' novels. There is a mind-boggling cornucopia of foodstuffs, described in this story. Never seen the beat of it. Kantor exhausts the English vocabulary on his treatment of Civil War-era food. It will make your stomach rumble and mouth water when you read some of these meals.It is also one of the great physical, brawny, stories ever; by this I mean villains just about as formidable, as ugly, despicable and menacing as found in anything by Dickens. Far worse. Violent men. And they need to be beaten down by good men. Hand-to-hand. Muscle vs muscle and brute vs brute. Ferocious amounts of blood and pain and upheaval. Melees. Mano a' mano combat.Overall it is a sad book; a book that goes into frank, gruesome detail towards our humanity. Sex and filth and hunger. Revenge and stupidity and rage. Loneliness, hopelessness, despair. Insanity. Men raping one another, beating on each other, stealing from one another, cold-bloodedly killing each other. Executing each other. Maiming each other. You will read about urine and feces and pus and bile and lice and rotten flesh and frostbite and bedbugs and vomit and scurvy, diarrhea, malnutrition, and shrapnel. Half-dead stick men shuffle from page to page, their skin covered with open, oozing sores. It is sad. But it is epic. Perhaps the greatest epic yet written about our land. How many others are there like it? How few decades have passed since this work--and all it upholds-- has already been forgotten? What would our culture resemble, if there were many such books as this? Compare Kantor's example to that of Dante. What Dante did for Italy, we can not find the equivalent for; yet we're in arguably more need. We need more books like this. Our short memory spans are killing us!"}, {"userName": "David", "userReviewDate": "Jun 06, 2018", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/83785-david", "userReview": "Epic and amazing."}, {"userName": "April Hochstrasser", "userReviewDate": "Jan 19, 2010", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/376900-april-hochstrasser", "userReview": "Andersonville was the name of a Confederate prison carved out of the timber of northeast Georgia. This book was a most distressing tale of POW Unionists enclosed inside the walls of 20 acres. At one time 40,000 men were there. They were given NO shelter and the food was a half a loaf of corn bread per day, but not real corn bread. This actually had the corn cobs ground up in it and was heavy as a brick. It made most men sick to eat it. There was no clean water and the area soon became a sewer where you had to live if you wanted to survive. Some were able to dig holes for shelter, but during the rainy season, well, you get the picture. Newcomers were set upon by the old-timers and most of their belongings were taken for use or barter. There were no rules inside the prison other than not to cross the deadline, about 20 feet from the walls. Savagry ruled the day and most people weren't cut out for the ruthlessness they encountered there.One of the more shocking examples was an old man following the men with diarrhea and eating the undigested food they found. Long before the world was horrified by European concentration camp in WW II, men were subjected to conditions even more shocking in Andersonville, Georgia. After 850 pages and almost 2 weeks of reading, I was ready to be done. MacKinlay Kantor did a nice job of following certain people from their decision to enlist to their probable death at Andersonville. He followed the lives of some of the guards and leaders of the camp and how they felt, some were sympathetic to the Yankees and others just wanted them to die. I can see why it won a Pulitzer Prize for literature and it certainly made me appreciate the conditions in which I live.

This one did. My junior year in high school (30+ years ago) our teacher gave us a list of books we could read for book reports. Like many young men raised in the south, I had been raised on the story of our gentlemanly struggle for states rights against the tyranny of the north. We flew the stars and bars at parties and concerts (Bands like Lynyrd Skynyrd were popular at the time) without a thought that it could be offensive. So I came into this book expecting to read about the noble confederate soldiers struggling against the much better equipped northerners. I spent my Christmas break reading the book and growing more and more horrified throughout. Not matter what you think of the politics of the civil war, this book shows how the combination of incompetence, lack of manpower, lack of compassion, and just plain inhumanity came together to create hell on earth. And it was physically and psychologically hellish for the prisoners, but also psychologically hellish for the guards.I came away ashamed of how the confederate forces treated their yankee prisoners, and horrified at the general inhumanity on both sides of the war. Which also lead me to look at how I (and some guys I called my friends) interacted with our black friends.

After touring the site of the prison, I wanted to learn more so I picked this book from among the many in the bookstore. At first it took a little getting used to the style of not using quotation marks for speaking parts, but once I got into the flow it was great.

It's a book that is caught in the middle of two different eras of writing: The historical war novel and the modernist revision of the war plot. Compared to the other US Civil War novels that had won the Pulitzer previously, this book is darker and more abstract than the generalized good vs. evil theme - and does a decent job at sidestepping the romantic vision of the Old South - but in its desire to be inclusive of all narratives it both overworks itself and falls short...Here's why:To begin, Andersonville was an actual POW camp run by the CSA to house captured Union soldiers at the end of the war. By the end of its term, a little over a year, historians have described it as one of the most atrocious camps housed on American soil with nearly 1/3 of all prisoners dying of disease from vile living conditions and malnourishment. Look it up if you are unfamiliar, the research of this book is essential because many of the characters were real life figures. As to why this book was written, Kantor was a war correspondent during WWII that witnessed the emancipation of Dachau. Having been a journalist, one of his largest and eventually unanswered questions is how did those living around this concentration camp react to it and did they ever attempt to intervene? Obviously, from a 21st Century take, we attribute this and most ill recorded moments in history as complacency. The book was, for me, split in 3 different parts: The first portion of the novel is about the figures on the outside of the fence, particularly the Claffey family from whom the land was purchased from. Here in lies one of my problems with the novel: The Claffey family is portrayed in a way that suggests they are enlightened and the average reader is meant to empathize with their situation but honestly it just isn't easy to. They are perceived as well read and intelligent and willing to progress with the times but remain appalled at the idea of abolitionism. They may not physically abuse or starve the slaves they own but they gaslight the families that live on their land into thinking they owe a debt. Obviously this is a 21st Century review of this novel (Which was written in the 1950s) but regardless of if someone was a \"good\" or \"bad\" slave owner doesn't excuse the fact that they owned people. To add on to the problematic portrayal of the Claffey homestead, the slaves themselves are unfortunately stereotyped as overly superstitious, unwilling to become educated, and/or listless....also I don't even want to get started on the Claffey daughter playing \"Florence Nightingale\" on the children. This is a Goodreads review not a thesis so I will just leave it at that. I just didn't care much for these characters or their troubles.The second portion of the book deals with the actual historic situations within the camp. Again, I felt very little empathy for any of the Confederate soldiers who ran the camp and even less for the Union Raiders within. Again this involves a bit of research but, honestly, it just felt like a fictionalized take on a wikipedia article that lasted for about 200+ pages. I should state I am not a fan of linear war novels so it is good that these plotlines were kind of intermingled but much of the time I found myself zoning out. Oops. The third portion which I found the most gripping were the individual stories of the prisoners which were written more like vignettes. These were heartbreaking and quietly unresolved or - at the very least - dreamlike. As I was reading this I am also reading Michener's Tales of the South Pacific which many attribute to a major shift in popular writing -- essentially a collection of short stories that tell the tale as a whole. I honestly wish all of Andersonville was written in this format because it leaves the reader with more questions forcing you to linger on a thought rather than a resolute. This is war, there are no resolutes. But hell, it was written in 1955 so there ya go.Overall, this is more of a 3.5 star mainly because I LOVED half of what was going on and then just felt no connection to the other half... If you're interested in historical war novels this is an interesting, oft referenced but not explained, portion of the civil war. If you don't care about war novels...skip it."}, {"userName": "Ron Housley", "userReviewDate": "Mar 15, 2014", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/23906062-ron-housley", "userReview": "AndersonvilleMacKinlay Kantor, 1955Whew\u2026.760 brutal pages later! Initially I thought the style was just cute, absent quotation marks, making the reader guess whether it was a thought or a spoken word; making the reader guess who the thought or word might be directed toward; making the reader guess. Then in time it\u2019s not so much of an issue as each reader launches his own personal protocol to automatize the guessing, but never completely certain if his automatized guess actually comported with the author\u2019s intention. One had to do a lot of inferring. But no matter, not really. But it was annoying. Andersonville hails from 1955; winner of the 1956 Pulitzer Prize; another notch on the Pulitzer belt. I\u2019d heard about it all these years; the History Channel has reported on the historical Rebel stockade down in Georgia, America\u2019s little holocaust.This History Channel, indeed! MacKinlay Kantor\u2019s Andersonville barraged us with a documentary-like assortment of characters and loosely connected action events. I\u2019m not sure that we got much in the character development department; I\u2019m not sure that we got much in the plot department; but we did get a stringing together of individual impressions of the Civil War\u2019s closest approximation to Auschwitz. No truly central character; no real heroes; the historical context disqualifies calling the bad guys villains; no fundamental struggle with basic values, not really; nobody facing moral conflict, except where the reader himself may be making judgments from his perch well removed from the time and place.We got a heavy dose of pus, blood, vomit, diarrhea, gangrene and rotting corpses. Isn\u2019t that what the Yellow Journalism school was so famous for? Think Upton Sinclair.Back in 1956, the New York Times did a sprawling review, beginning on Page One of the NYT Book Review. Even though Kantor apparently researched his book for 25 years, there\u2019s still a lot of talk of this being one more propagandized account of the Andersonville debacle. Why was there so much propaganda about Andersonville? Dozens of books were published right after the Civil War to gain sympathy of Legislators to dispense favors. It is widely thought that the accounts were largely falsified, including testimony from the Wirz trial; and that much of it has fallen into the domain of accepted truths. Even Snopes can\u2019t figure out real from legend on this one.OPPORTUNITY FOR REFLECTION \u2014 No. 1The reading did afford some opportunity for reflection. When the \u201cgood guy\u201d prisoners wipe out the \u201cbad guy\u201d prisoners, over the span of a few chapters, we are treated to some excellent philosophy, to wit: \u201cIt was an object lesson for all time; yet man might never learn that a wickedness must be singled out and struck if it is to be done away with.\u201d (p. 330); and also, \u201cThe lesson was reiterated during those intense minutes; yet it would be ignored and forgotten.\u201d (p330)If only the Western nations would have had courage to proceed with such a realization, as they allowed Hitler to proceed unimpeded to destroy most of Europe; if only Western nations would have embraced such a realization and taken the Iranian nuclear threat seriously \u2014 so much death and heartache could have been avoided if these present threats were \u201csingled out and struck\u201d and \u201cdone away with.\u201d ! But alas, no lessons are ever learned.OPPORTUNITY FOR REFLECTION \u2014 No. 2And near the end we get a bit of William Tecumseh Sherman philosophy sprinkled in: \u201c\u2026there\u2019s nothing to do but make war so terrible that when peace comes it will last.\u201d (p. 624) And, \u201c\u2026if the Southerners find that their burning of bridges only destroys their own houses, they\u2019ll soon stop it.\u201dSherman provided what John David Lewis always called \u201can optical demonstration.\u201d Lewis articulated the principle that to win a war, one must take the war to the homeland of the enemy and destroy his will to fight. And that in doing so, one must \u201cshow\u201d (an \u201coptical demonstration\u201d) the enemy a plain example. Sherman \u201cshowed\u201d and Kantor gave us a few brush strokes to memorialize that aspect of Andersonville.But Kantor showed us Ira Claffey, one of those Southern plantation owners who was allegedly supporting the Southern war effort which allowed this conflict to drag on for so many years; was he among the targets whom Sherman intended to impress, in his \u201ctake the war to the homeland of the enemy\u201d strategy? I think so. OPPORTUNITY FOR REFLECTION \u2014 No. 3That very same Ira Claffey makes the \u201ccase\u201d (p. 97) that if the Negroes were freed, then they\u2019d be exploited by the evil whites, especially in the north \u2014 because they are presently ignorant and childlike. That\u2019s exactly like saying that if you abolished Social Security, all the old people would wither and die. What one has to consider is the alternative, in both these cases, of (a)establishing and agreeing upon the immorality of the present system, combined with (b)a plan to gradually dismantle the present system to ameliorate the personal damage. The alternative is not even imagined, not even by Kantor. That\u2019s probably why our rulers always chose force to solve problems that were originally caused only because force was used in the first place.IS IT A NOVEL?A \u201cthriller\u201d is when you know \u201cwho did it\u201d but you don\u2019t know how it\u2019s going to happen. The only incident in all of Andersonville that fits this model was the lead-up to confrontation where Dreyfoos (a \u201cgood guy\u201d) would take on the raiders (the \u201cbad guys\u201d). It was like having a \u201cplot,\u201d almost. We had a purposeful sequence of events aimed at achieving an objectives; values were being pursued. It was entirely superficial; there was no moral dilemma; but it was a struggle for a certain value, nevertheless; and it was but one small episode. Everybody likes to see justice brought upon a bully; but that\u2019s hardly a universal moral accomplishment. And it\u2019s hardly the stuff to qualify a book as Pulitzer worthy.Or how about the \u201cstruggle\u201d of Veronica for her own sanity? Could she win that struggle with hard work, or not? That would be a pretty lame plot point if it were to have evolved. But the whole thing is presented as hopeless, from beginning to end. It could have been a central element of a novel; but in Kantor\u2019s book it wasn\u2019t.OVER ALL? I see where Andersonville sold 121,000 copies in 1955; and 100,000 more copies in 1956. At the time, that was considered a wildly successful bestseller. Questions linger: was it hard hitting realistic? Or was it fabricated on propagandistic legend? Did Kantor deliberately spew out 760 pages without a plot? Or did he really mean for it to be considered a novel? Few characters lasted more than a few chapters. And those who did last retained an aloof superficiality. Was it accidental or deliberate that Kantor showed us both positive and negative characters from both the North and the South? Did he want us to conclude that both sides had good? What? Or did he just want us to see a vividly shocking concentration camp, in the same manner as if it were men falling into the acid pit at a meat packing plant in Chicago? I could not find a central plot or a main character whose values I might engage with or follow. Instead, I got endless detail about the prison camp, about prison life, on and on it went. It\u2019s a pretty shallow plot when the only thing a reader can wonder is who will still be alive when the war is over\u2026."}, {"userName": "Alisa", "userReviewDate": "Mar 23, 2014", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/11481792-alisa", "userReview": "Kantor's Andersonville is truly a great American novel. Yet as I read it, I could anticipate the criticisms some would have of it: it's too long (more than 700 pages), the plot isn't coherent, the topic is too depressing, etc. As I thought about those who hadn't or wouldn't like this novel, I realized that the critics just don't have the patience to work through a complicated piece of historical fiction, one that challenges the reader to keep track of characters and face a lot of unpleasantness about America's past. Yes, it's more than 700 pages. I read the book in about a week, and it occupied every free moment I had. When I was finished, I felt like I had my life back. Thankfully, Kantor's novel lends itself to reading in small segments. It's a chewy book, not one I could devour, although I tried! Yes, it's got a lot of characters to keep up with. Some are with you the whole book; others are present for only, a chapter. The back stories of the Union prisoners are often a chapter in length, and in that chapter Kantor paints a full picture of that man's pre-war life, his loves, his ambitions. These chapters give us a fleeting glimpse of a man--but that's because the man's life itself was fleeting, lost at Andersonville. I was particularly touched by the stories of Meriwhether, an orphan boy, and Nathan Dreyfoos, a well-traveled, well-educated man who makes his time at Andersonville tolerable by remembering the past. Kantor also captures a variety of Confederate characters. Ira Claffey is a plantation owner who is more enlightened than most men of the time, but he's not a perfect man, and he's trying to deal with the reality of his world vanishing. There are the Tebbs brothers, Floral and Coral, with demons of their own. Some of the characters find a kind of redemption; others don't. Two of my favorite episodes include the Tebbs brothers, one where Floral is heading on an adventure with his friends, only to discover they are headed to the local cat house, where Floral's mother \"entertains\" men. Coral, returned from the war minus a foot, deals with an intense anger and wishes for a blind revenge against the man who injured him. Yet he gains sympathy when he helps an escaped prisoner, one who was likewise at Gettysburg, one who likewise lost a limb. Yes, it's depressing. Though man's inhumanity to man is a common theme in all kinds of literature and in life itself, the inhumanity the Union prisoners suffered was of the most horrific kind. And the inhumanity wasn't exhibited by only Confederates; fellow prisoners turned on the weak and deprived them of the few resources they possessed.Kantor's novel is not for everyone. It requires patience, and it requires the ability to look into a human soul and see every beauty and every evil that resides there."}, {"userName": "Jonathan", "userReviewDate": "Jul 24, 2011", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/1766263-jonathan", "userReview": "This book tells the story of the infamous Confederate prison, where over 45,000 Union soldiers were held and over 13,000 died. Kantor uses fictional and historical characters, tying the story together via a fictional neighbor of the prison, plantation owner Ira Claffey. It is a very hard book to read, both for its heartbreakingly depressing story of the inhumane conditions, its length (well over 700 pages), the use of vernacular and the peculiar avoidance of quotes. While it seems odd, not using quotations really worked in this book, as it made it more of a tale told by a real storyteller rather than \"just\" a book. Andersonville was the result of over 25 years of research by Kantor. It was a bestseller when it was published in 1955 and won the Pulitzer Prize the next year.The book opens and closes with Ira Claffey, the local plantation owner who watches the prison get built, agonizes over the deplorable conditions and it closes after the American Civil War ends, as Claffey wonders if America will ever get back on track. Claffey's story is told throughout, as he tries to come to grips with the changing moral landscape, as times get tough and he finally loses control over his slaves (he is, of course, a beneficent slave owner).Other chapters include interweaving stories of the deplorable and tragic conditions in the prison. Each of the prisoner chapters distills an amazing amount of detail, while encompassing an entire life. And often the end is not good for the character in question. Kantor also tells the story of the heroic efforts of some of the staff (including a doctor who woos Claffey's daughter) to try to remedy the horrific conditions in the prison.It also tells the story of the commander, Henry Wirth, who was tried and executed after the war for Andersonville, although many today think he was merely a scapegoat. In fact, Kantor paints a relatively sympathetic portrait of him, as a commander struggling to overcome the government's apathy towards the prison, as it sends more and more prisoners there, all the while ignoring pleas for supplies and medicine. Most of the real monsters are from within, as gangs of prisoners pick on the weak and disabled in a real struggle for existence, although there are plenty of examples of guard and officer depravity as well.Like I said, a very hard book to read but incredibly rewarding. Each prisoner's story was a heartfelt tale, even if told with an impending feeling of doom. 19th century America comes alive through these vignettes. The writing was powerful, and you can feel the veracity of it. Hard work, yes, but in the end, well worth it."}, {"userName": "Karyl", "userReviewDate": "Nov 03, 2008", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/1462387-karyl", "userReview": "About halfway into this book, I looked up some reviews of it on Amazon.com. Several people wrote that they had read this book twenty-five or thirty years ago (it was published in the 1950s), yet it had stuck with them all this time. I am not surprised. The sheer awfulness of a 28-acre pen holding 50,000 prisoners, the horror of so many men in one place, the starvation due to lack of provisions, the thousands of deaths from easily curable diseases and infections, the filth resulting from a lack of proper sewage, the degradation of the men locked inside... it all becomes almost too much. Yet somehow you can't look away, and among all the horror are little glimmers of hope. I read several reviews of this book in which it was mentioned that this book moves slowly. I agree that it begins at an excruciatingly slow pace, but now that I have finished the entire thing, I can see how the author kept building the story, layer upon layer. It's also been mentioned that the lack of quotation marks when a character is speaking is annoying; however, I adapted to the lack rather quickly and hardly noticed it. I enjoyed getting to know so thoroughly the various characters, both prisoners and their Confederate captors, cheering when the prisoners won some small victory and mourning the death of yet another noble Union soldier. Kantor goes into great detail with each and every character, fleshing them out with anecdotes from their previous lives before they were soldiers, before they were prisoners, before they were jailers. This book does an excellent job of portraying the conflict between the Confederate chain of command and those in charge of the prison, between the Union prisoners and the Confederate jailers, and even within each man as you see, time and again, men realizing that their enemies are really their brothers, worthy of whatever assistance can be rendered. You realize that nothing is ever as clear-cut as North vs. South, Union vs. Confederate, prisoner vs. jailer.It's not a book to enter into lightly; this is not a book to take to the beach. But I am so glad I stuck it out to the bitter end, and like so many other reviewers before me, I will carry this novel with me for the rest of my life."}, {"userName": "Jessica Gordon", "userReviewDate": "Aug 27, 2011", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/5920034-jessica-gordon", "userReview": "I want to give this book 2.5 stars but there is no such option. This book could have been good. There are so many things that would have made it good. But alas, it just didn't work for me. When a book is 1000 pages, I expect the characters to be thoroughly developed and the plot to be, well, a plot. I think these are minimal expectations. Each chapter in this long book features characters who re imprisoned in Andersonville during the Civil War--a horrid outdoor prison in the south. In this prison, prisoners set all the rules and basic anarchy is the norm. Those who are physically strong run the prison because they can steal whatever and whenever they want. Now, if there had been perhaps 10-12 characters and the author had alternated telling the story from each of their perspectives, that might have been a little hard to follow, but I would have enjoyed the book. I didn't count the number of characters whose stories are told, but it must be upward of thirty. Just when I would start to get to know a character and begin to sympathize with his story, a new story would begin. As you can imagine, this was very frustrating, and combined with the Civil War-time language, there wasn't much to find compelling. To be fair, I will admit that a few characters reigned in the book and their stories were woven throughout. But since I am being fair, I should also admit that the author didn't always do a good job of weaving their stories together and by the time a character was brought back up, I often had to go back and find his previous story, perhaps several hundred pages earlier, so that I might remember who the hell he was. I didn't buy this book because it was a Pulitzer Prize winner, but I was pleasantly surprised when I first received the book in the mail and learned that it had won this honor. I can see how this novel could have won the prize, had it been done successfully, but as it stands right now, I think the author was overly ambitious and what he tried to do, although brilliant in conception, was rather a failure in practice."}, {"userName": "Quesenberrys", "userReviewDate": "Aug 24, 2015", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/46215275-quesenberrys", "userReview": "A novel of the Civil War, set in the infamous Confederate prison camp where over 10,000 Union soldiers died, written in 1953, but considered by many critics to be the greatest Civil War novel in history. Kind of long, at over 700 pages, written in a classic style, full of idiom and interesting language, relationships, culture, in a sort of stream-of-consciousness, a very real-feeling book. You get to know many different characters, from both sides and many aspects of the conflict, learning their motivations and sorrows and beliefs. I really enjoyed this. I liked how it illuminated the humanity (or lack of humanity) in all its characters, North and South, military or civilian, with some characters being followed nearly throughout the entire book (like Ira Claffey, the plantation owner and his family) and others coming and going, like various prisoners in the camp who we learn about and then say goodbye to. We all find our way, we all deal with our travail in different ways. In the end, we learn to value peace, and learn to never take those long, peaceful days in our lives for granted."}, {"userName": "Hailey", "userReviewDate": "Mar 06, 2011", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/4734587-hailey", "userReview": "It took me forever to finish this book. It's so long, and I constantly had to keep looking words up (mind you, I was in seventh grade), but I still found it to be a very interesting story. I love how while staying on the topic of Andersonville, Kantor played in the parts of people living in Georgia at the time and their thoughts of the war. I also, of course, loved the romance mixed into the story. The descriptions given of the living conditions in the fort, while they were horrid, really intruiged me. I really liked the different groups in the fort, too. You had those who stayed to the edges, just trying to live, those trying to reach justice, and the raiders. I really hated the raiders and loved the Regulators. It makes me sick to think of the boys my age in Andersonville having to live through that, that is if they were lucky enough to survive. In conclusion, I would recomend this story to probably high school and up, because even being in the top classes, I still found some of the vocabulary and the ideas hard to comprehend. This book was great otherwise, and I would hope ya'll would enjoy it as much as me!"}], "description": "The 1956 Pulitzer Prize-winning story of the Andersonville Fortress and its use as a concentration camp-like prison by the South during the Civil War.", "title": "Andersonville", "url": "https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/77239.Andersonville", "average": 4.11, "cover": "https://images.gr-assets.com/books/1424334448l/77239.jpg", "reviews": 287, "authors": [{"url": "https://www.goodreads.com/author/show/16893.MacKinlay_Kantor", "name": "MacKinlay Kantor"}], "type": ["Historical", "Fiction", "Military History", "War"], "outlinks": ["http://www.goodreads.com/book/show/77239.Andersonville", "http://www.goodreads.com/book/show/9048495-andersonville", "http://www.goodreads.com/book/show/23398640-andersonville", "http://www.goodreads.com/book/show/24036135-andersonville", "http://www.goodreads.com/book/show/2557517.Andersonville", "http://www.goodreads.com/book/show/842940.If_the_South_Had_Won_the_Civil_War", "http://www.goodreads.com/book/show/703842.Gettysburg", "http://www.goodreads.com/book/show/119263.Long_Remember", "http://www.goodreads.com/book/show/2283629.Spirit_Lake", "http://www.goodreads.com/book/show/853544.The_Voice_of_Bugle_Ann", "http://www.goodreads.com/book/show/39928984-mercy-among-the-children", "http://www.goodreads.com/book/show/20620995-take-me-with-you", "http://www.goodreads.com/book/show/6565401-five-quarters-of-the-orange", "http://www.goodreads.com/book/show/25600623-the-diver-s-clothes-lie-empty", "http://www.goodreads.com/book/show/18867378-the-traveler-s-gift", "http://www.goodreads.com/book/show/40198373-big-stone-gap", "http://www.goodreads.com/book/show/40198387-friendship-bread", "http://www.goodreads.com/book/show/40193401-the-little-giant-of-aberdeen-county", "http://www.goodreads.com/book/show/35963775-her-sister-s-shoes", "http://www.goodreads.com/book/show/22617980-the-rock-harbor-collection", "http://www.goodreads.com/book/show/35269080-a-thousand-tomorrows", "http://www.goodreads.com/book/show/40204902-caravans", "http://www.goodreads.com/book/show/31192689-shoeless-joe", "http://www.goodreads.com/book/show/40204877-a-hero-of-france", "http://www.goodreads.com/book/show/6473113-death-in-venice", "http://www.goodreads.com/book/show/40266651-the-tilted-world", "http://www.goodreads.com/book/show/33117501-blonde", "http://www.goodreads.com/book/show/36546758-ever-after", "http://www.goodreads.com/book/show/40193580-rescue", "http://www.goodreads.com/book/show/22032837-the-pearl-that-broke-its-shell", "http://www.goodreads.com/book/show/36589911-the-lords-of-discipline", "http://www.goodreads.com/book/show/11963271-the-sheltering-sky", "http://www.goodreads.com/book/show/25596951-the-dressmaker-s-war", "http://www.goodreads.com/book/show/35120598-gena-finn", "http://www.goodreads.com/book/show/29550710-a-charles-martin-collection", "http://www.goodreads.com/book/show/19977229-remember-tuesday-morning", "http://www.goodreads.com/book/show/8530701-a-town-like-alice", "http://www.goodreads.com/book/show/35414455-the-other-alcott", "http://www.goodreads.com/book/show/18800554-the-scavenger-s-daughters", "http://www.goodreads.com/book/show/40205036-under-the-udala-trees", "http://www.goodreads.com/book/show/32861105-the-streets-have-no-king", "http://www.goodreads.com/book/show/39929534-the-passion", "http://www.goodreads.com/book/show/35654710-this-dark-road-to-mercy", "http://www.goodreads.com/book/show/11513574-breath-eyes-memory", "http://www.goodreads.com/book/show/21942189-the-language-of-hoofbeats", "http://www.goodreads.com/book/show/18165412-house-of-bathory", "http://www.goodreads.com/book/show/37984397-we-own-the-sky", "http://www.goodreads.com/book/show/36004055-not-perfect"]}
