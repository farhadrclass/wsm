Karen White reigns supreme when it comes to modern day southern fried storytelling. I love Karen White\u2019s novels, so it\u2019s fair to say I\u2019m a little biased when it comes to her books, but this one is really special. Marilee and her two children are uprooted from their lives after her husband, Michael cheats on her with their child's third grade teacher. Moving to Sweet Apple, Georgia, Marilee rents a cottage from a gruff elderly woman everyone calls \u2018Sugar\u2019. As Marilee gets settled in, she meets the other mothers in town, forges friendships, and may even have a love interest. But, one of the most important relationships she cultivates is with Sugar, as the two women begin sharing a type of quid pro quo confession of their painful past and sins, while unearthing a few old mysteries and solving a crime along the way. There are books I enjoy, books that touch me or move me, books that make me laugh, or keep me on the edge of my seat. Some books combine all those elements, like this one did, but few of them hit all the notes with perfect tone and pitch and harmonizing, quite like this book did. I haven\u2019t read a book like this one in a long time and I really, really, really needed this kind of story. While books often focus on marriages, romance, and relationships within the family, allowing friendship bonds to lurk around the surface, this book places friendship front and center, and teaches a few valuable life lessons in the process. We all have regrets, have all made mistakes, suffered painful losses, some more than others, and confession can be good for the soul. This is something Sugar discovered, albeit kicking and screaming and determined not to allow anyone to melt that carefully constructed exterior she hides behind. Marilee finds in Sugar a dependable friend, a mother figure, and an unlikely kindred spirit. Sometimes, we still, even well into adulthood, seek approval, a salve for our loneliness, and a way to seek redemption for things we wish we could take back or redo, which is something Marilee goes through in this novel, while Sugar watches from the sidelines, ready to step in if and when necessary. The characters in this book are going to stay with me for a long time. They are so well crafted, realistic and vivid I would swear they came to life. The plot is amazingly well crafted, quirky, emotional, witty and humorous, but also suspenseful and edgy. The southern setting is a Karen White trademark, and as I've said many times before, there is just something about a story told with a southern flair that pronounces everything, from the food, (cookies in this case), to the scenery, to the dialogue. Karen White has that flair down to a science, and this novel is no exception, in fact, it\u2019s exceptional. In other words, this story has something for everyone, and can be read by anyone, and enjoyed by all, and is the type of story that is good for your soul. I loved it! So, you\u2019ve heard me gush long enough. Go forth and pre-order this book, you won\u2019t regret it!"}, {"userName": "PorshaJo", "userReviewDate": "May 21, 2017", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/5464046-porshajo", "userReview": "What a fun read just full of Southern charm! There is an author who writes about the South and I love her books but I've read all but one. So I was looking for another author who gives you that fun, chicken-soup-for-the-soul read. This book just fit the needs for me. I bugged my library for the audio after reading the wonderful review by Norma on this one.The Night the Lights Went Out is told from three points of view. Merilee, a recent divorcee under scandalous circumstances, Sugar, the stubborn, firecracker landlord of the property that Merilee moves into with her children, and an anonymous blogger who dishes out gossip on the locals. Many who wish they are not mentioned in this blog. The story takes place in Sweet Apple, Georgia. Come on, with a town name like, that you know your in for a story. When the point of view switches to Sugar, it goes back in time and you learn of her past. What makes her that spunky, Southern woman that she is today. So many Southern saying explained and rules that women in the town must follow. Don't get me wrong...it wasn't all fluff. There was revenge, deceit, and murder involved too. Let's just say this one takes the concept of 'Mean Girl' to a whole new level.I listened to the audio narration and it was wonderful. The two narrators had the heaviest Southern accents and it was perfect for the book. There was a third narrator, but the accent wasn't the same as the others. Oh there were times I laughed out loud at this one. Now, it is a bit predictable but I was not disappointed in this one bit. Merilee was a dunce for most of the story, when you can see what is going on, but she just can't. I will have to say, I was completely shocked by who the blogger was as I had thought of it being someone else. A fun read that I would highly suggest if you just want to relax and laugh and forget about what is going on for a bit."}, {"userName": "Pouting Always", "userReviewDate": "Jul 01, 2017", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/48650982-pouting-always", "userReview": "[ Sugar ended up being behind it  (hide spoiler)]"}, {"userName": "Norma * Traveling Sister", "userReviewDate": "Apr 26, 2017", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/41400192-norma-traveling-sister", "userReview": "This was an impressive first book for me by this author and a delightful listen with enjoyable narrators that was entertaining and filled with southern charm! I will definitely be reading more books by this author.THE NIGHT THE LIGHTS WENT OUT by KAREN WHITE is a relaxing, comforting, and amusing women's fiction and suspense/thriller novel that had me totally engrossed and savouring every moment while I was listening to this book.I absolutely love the cover of this book and found the title also appealing and very fitting which draws you right into this modern day southern tale of family drama, a murder mystery, revenge, secrets and lies while exploring the true meaning of friendship.THE NIGHT THE LIGHTS WENT OUT is cleverly told in three different points of view of Merilee Talbot Dunlap, Sugar Prescott, and an anonymous blogger all from Sweet Apple, Georgia. Sugar\u2019s point of view also alternates between stories of her past and her present day voice bringing past mysteries into the storyline which come together in the present. Sugar was my favourite character but I am not going to say why as you have to experience her personality all on your own! I absolutely loved each installment of the blog as the blogger was extremely entertaining, funny, cheeky, and spirited. I even loved the title of the blog! The Playing Fields Blog: Observations of Suburban Life from Sweet Apple, Georgia; Written by Your Neighbor. The blogger reveals some local gossip, observations, life lessons, and offers a few entertaining Southernism sayings at the end of each installment which I found absolutely amusing! No one knows who the anonymous blogger is but I had a sneaky suspicion who I thought it might have been and my observations were correct and it was pleasing.I really liked KAREN WHITE\u2019S writing style, narrative, and how the storyline was delivered as I was entertained and interested to the very end. Even though I had a good idea how it was all going to play out it was still an extremely enjoyable listen.

What I like most about Whites novels is her ability to create memorable characters and, of course, her great southern humor. I felt a great affection for Sugar who reminded me so much of my grandmother, who grew up in rural SC working on a tobacco farm located on a dirt road named after her family. Like Sugar, she spoke her mind and was as spunky at 95 yrs old as she was at 25. Though parts of this were a bit predictable, I still really enjoyed it."}, {"userName": "KAS", "userReviewDate": "Apr 11, 2017", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/20691061-kas", "userReview": "4.5 StarsWell, hush my mouth! What a southern stunner!Karen White is a master at spinning a southern yarn. Just the names alone, Merilee and Sugar, clue you in right away you are about to get knee deep into the lives of women born and bred in the south. Ms. White's ability to develop unforgettable characters is superb and her writing skills are exquisite.We first meet Merilee Talbot Dunlap and her two children, Lily and Colin, ten and eight respectively, as they are packing up the van and moving. After eleven years of marriage, she is still reeling from her recent divorce. Her ex-husband, Michael, had an affair with their daughter's third grade teacher, and got her pregnant, no less. They are moving into a cottage owned by a ninety-three year old woman by the name of Sugar Prescott. And, of course, the children will be attending a new school. The scandal is front and center news in the small town of Sweet Water, Georgia.Sugar is quite particular with whom she befriends, and they have always been few and far between. She has no filter, and says whatever is on her mind.. She has her \"stink-eye\" look down to a science. When Sugar hears a newly divorcee and her children are in need of a place to stay, she is willing to rent out the cottage behind her farmhouse, but wants to keep their relationship strictly as landlord and tenant. But Merilee and her children stir up feelings from her past, and she can't seem to keep her distance from them. An unlikely friendship blossoms between the two women, and they discover just how much they have in common once they begin to share stories they would much rather keep buried.And then ..... there was Heather. An unforgettable woman of which I could write six paragraphs, but I won't. The role she plays in this story is pivotal, but I will let you discover all about her personality for yourself.I loved the following quote from Heather .....\u2003\n\"I can always tell a native Georgian. Hard to hide it, isn't it? It's almost like no matter how far you go in life, all you have to do is open your mouth and somebody knows exactly where you're from.\"\nThis was a delightful read with twists, turns and unimaginable events the residents of Sweet Water, Georgia, have never seen the likes of. Bless their heart!*I received an advanced copy of this book, via Netgalley, in exchange for an honest review*"}, {"userName": "Margitte", "userReviewDate": "Aug 19, 2017", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/7481492-margitte", "userReview": "This is one of the most skillfully crafted mysteries that I have read in a very very long time.Starting out as a one-way street to happiness for Merilee Talbot Dunlap, a newly divorced mother of two in the Southern idiom of chicken-soup-for-the-soul read(s), so aptly named by Porsha, the story completely turns the mystery genre on its fine head. Included in the upside down view are the botoxed, helicopter-moms of Sweet Apple, Georgia, with their bling medals of social standing in the suburban road to social nirvana. The Windwood Academy got them all grouped together: the sleek perfected bodies of yoga-ed, gym-ned, tennis visor-ed, dark Chanel sunglass-ed, SUV-ed gang of super beautiful moms, who had all men insisting to take the kids to school. Such a parade of beauty cannot not be missed. Instead of opening with the murder, like all well-respected, good murder mysteries is suppose to do, and working the story backwards as the sleuthing progresses, this story begins with an introduction and focus on bitchdom at its finest with no criminal intent anywhere near the plot. Head of the pact is the childless 93-year-old Sugar Prescott, or Alice Prescott Bates, a vigorous opponent of consumerism and social aspirations, who rents out The Craftsman cottage on her land to Merilee. Soon the ruler of bitchdom, Heather Blackford, enters the story with her clinging troupes of desperate wannabe groupies, opening up like the red sea for her to reach Merilee at the school gates. And as they say... the mix is on ....Just one fly in the happily-ever-after soup: THE PLAYING FIELDS BLOG written by 'Your Neighbor'. And boy, does this blogger have the goods on everybody. A lot of huffing and puffing ensue when old secrets and new threats are charmingly woven into the weekly word feasts. Merilee, not named in the blog, is embedded in the blogger's introduction of an old southern expression: the new broom might sweep clean but it's the old broom who knows the corners. Merilee is the past-expiry-date ex-wife, who is replaced by a trophy wife, and Merilee is hardly in her Thirties! Euphemisms isn't the blogger's beat. It is clear that the blogger knows the way around the perpetually haunted, and is slowly but surely flashing them out of their hiding places...Truth, after all, was as sticky as molasses. Yes, Truth, like oil, will always rise to the surface.You better clean up your own backyard before you start talking trash, another favorite expression of 'Your Neighbor', has many faces red, veins at aneurysm point, with nervous fluttering of eyes when nobody is around to witness the effect of the blogger's southern wisdoms. Sugar Prescott and Merilee slowly become friends when their co-habitation on the same land encourages a new bond which neither of them ever had with anybody before. Their tragic pasts enfold in trusted conversations around Merilee's kitchen adventures as Sugar teaches her to cook proper southern meals for the kids. The old dame, with her yoga classes three times a week at the Prescott Bend Country Club; her Fitbit which forces her to walk everyday; her Bible classes; and her giant old baby blue Lincoln car, has a firm grip on life, which she does not plan to exchange for a room in a godforsaken old age facility. She also does not have the problem to be always nice to her children who will choose her nursing home one day. ...the indignity of being moved into such a place, like a box of old toys that a child has outgrown but doesn't want to get rid of completely, passes her by in her childless state. She is happy in her own home, tapping out long letters to her dearest and oldest friend, Willa Faye Mackenzie Cox, on her 1949 Smith-Corona typewriter, her bottle of White-Out sitting nearby. She has a bag of principles left at her age, but also the promise to herself that she would never love anything again that she could not bear to lose.Merilee has to come to terms with her past, her divorce and her future. The new bond opens up the possibility for her to become the person she always wanted to be. Not only must she confront all the events in her earlier life, but also her ability to handle it all. In the history of Sweet Apple, the next thirty days promise to become like The Tower of Terror, Times Square and Armageddon rolled into one. Life no longer will be an unbroken road full of wonderful for the town. The new curves in the road, winding through old memories, heartbreak and tragedy will test the people of Sweet Apple's mettle and character. But with the friends and those who loved each other along for the ride, the bridges to overcome will be put into place where the puddles wait.But first they have to weather the storm. An extraordinary tornado is brewing over the town. Wade Kimball fixes the cellar doors at Merilee's house, for just in case. However, metaphorically it becomes a lake on the make, with old resentments and bad karma becoming fast friends in a very short span of time. The calamity becomes critical to the plot, central to the The Night The Lights Went Off. It will be the night when sound waves will solidify and become lightning - the sawmill of a storm, and split pine trees in half. Mimetic, like the real thing, it will flash down into the middle of everyone's secrets. It becomes the portal to new beginnings. A meteorological phenomena in the lives of everybody. (Using the storm, lightning and rain as pathetic fallacy in this book, was highly effective.)Needless to say, this is a must-read for those who need a chicken-soup-for-the-soul read. Brilliantly constructed. Excellent entertainment. Funny, soul-enriching, pleasant, sad, but just beautiful! Chick-lit fluff present, but not annoyingly so."}, {"userName": "Elizabeth of Silver's Reviews", "userReviewDate": "Apr 01, 2017", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/1882027-elizabeth-of-silver-s-reviews", "userReview": "A new town, a new home, a friend you really don't want, a blog that tells the town's gossip, and Merilee has to deal with all of this along with her divorced husband and his pregnant girlfriend.Living in Sweet Apple, Georgia, seemed like a good town to start over and for the most part it was.Merilee was renting a house on the property of the town's oldest citizen, Sugar Preston. Sugar was portrayed as anything but sweet, but actually she was.Merilee and Sugar became friends and shared stories from Sugar's childhood that made sense as to why Sugar was the way she was.Sugar and quite a few town residents had secrets, and now that Merilee arrived in town, the anonymous blog writer had more ammunition for her daily posts and Southern sayings. As Sugar knew, there were more people in this town that had better stories than Merilee had. Sugar's past was a soap opera in itself and filled with stories but no one dared to tell them except Sugar herself and many stories were told for the first time to Merilee.Totally and completely enjoyed the characters and the story line of THE NIGHT THE LIGHTS WENT OUT. Sugar was very lovable, Merilee was sweet, and I didn't like Heather from the minute I met her. Readers of women's fiction will again be transported back to the days of Southern \u200bhospitality and then brought back to current day with women who keep secrets and have everything and like to flaunt it.Ms. White has done it again with a marvelous story filled with wonderful characters with Southern charm\u200b.

I decided to read The Night the Lights Went Out because of two recent mediocre literary fiction reads. I was ready for something light and entertaining, and I had room to tolerate the comfort of some predictability. Karen White delivered what I was looking for. Set in Georgia, the story focuses on the parallel lives of recently divorced Marilee and her 93 year landlady Sugar. Marilee is trying to fit into her new community and Sugar is way past the need to fit in anywhere or ingratiate herself with anyone. They both have secrets. The town has a few secrets. The story moves back and forth in time. Things are not always as they seem. Tensions build up somewhat predictably, but not to the detriment of my enjoyment. It was the characters and their back story that I enjoyed the most and that made this one worth reading. I especially liked Sugar. I won't say more to avoid spoilers. It's a good book to read for light entertainment-- maybe a good beach read. It did the trick. Now I have to continue my quest for something more meaty.

The star of this book is most definitely Miss Sugar Prescott. She's a lifelong resident of Sweet Apple, Georgia, a place that may seem perfect on the surface, but what lies beneath is a different story.Now in her mid-90s, Sugar is still tough, headstrong, and sharp as a tack. Sugar rents a cottage on her property to Merilee Dunlap, a recently divorced mom with two children in tow. Merilee's life in Sweet Apple won't be what she expected, but luckily she's got Sugar on her side.This book alternates between Sugar in the past (early 1930s) and Merilee's ordeal in present day Sweet Apple. All around I just enjoyed Sugar's story and character the best. Other parts I found a bit predictable and hard to believe, but overall it was an enjoyable read - nice blend of mystery, historical fiction, Southern drama, and a dash of romance.

As sweet as a Georgia peach, and as scandalous as Desperate Housewives\u2019 Wisteria Lane, and Big Little Lies.  Set aside the time, readers . . . you are going to love Sugar! The Southern Queen B  has created her best yet! Yay Atlanta . . . From the stunning WOW cover and the memorable characters, Karen White grabs you and pulls you into this Southern suburban neighborhood filled with drama, revenge, secrets and lies, while exploring the true meaning of friendship. It is not always as it appears. Alternating between the 1930s  Depression-era Georgia and a modern-day 2016 Sweet Apple, Georgia (fictional) suburb of north Atlanta. Let the games begin. Meet the 3 leading ladies:  \u2022 Merilee Talbot Dunlap, newly divorc\u00e9e, single mom, mysterious past \u2022 Alice Prescott Bates, Matriarch aka Sugar Prescott, landlady \u2022 Heather Blackford, Socialite, beautiful, perfectionist  An anonymous blogger  offers up entertaining essential Southernisms any Yankee in the South should know, sprinkled throughout. \u201cIt\u2019s never about the secret itself, but the keeping of it.\u201dFrom the wealthy private school, social climbing moms to a young single divorced mom who discover (the hard way) . . . the true meaning of friendship and the dangers of deception. Against the modern-day scandals, we meet matriarch Sugar Prescott who is at the center of the novel. A grounding force. A courageous woman you want on your side. Sugar is wise, and has had her own share of tragedy and can relate to her new tenant, on more than one level. Merilee Talbot Dunlap  had learned in eleven years of marriage, it was the simple fact that you could live with a person for a long time and never really know him. One day the mask slips. Her husband, Michael has an affair with their daughter\u2019s third-grade math teacher, Tammy. Merilee decides she does not want to stay in the house with all the reminders. She was traded in for a younger woman. She needs to escape from all the gossip. However, she is unaware, it may be the lesser of two evils. What lies ahead at the new location, maybe even more devastating. Merilee is the mother of ten-year-old old daughter Lily and eight-year-old Colin. They were now moving into a quaint furnished Craftsman historic cottage (with a cellar) for tornados, located behind Mrs. Prescott\u2019s farmhouse in Sweet Apple, GA. The landlord is a southern matriarch and well-respected in the community. Some say she is harsh. She is known as Sugar. She is widowed (Tom killed in the war) and no children. A mystery, to some. Fascinating and eccentric to others. Sugar Prescott  (Alice Prescott Bates) is ninety-four years old (what a great character)! She lives alone in an old farmhouse on her family\u2019s land. Her loyal best friend Willa Faye Mackenzie. Willa Faye moved to a senior living facility. While Sugar was staying put as long, as possible. A realtor had found the young mother and her two children as her new tenants. Not that she had any desire to befriend her new tenants and neighbor, but Sugar had the feeling that Merilee was suddenly on her own and in need of help. Sugar was in a position, to understand that need more than most. She suspected but would deny if anyone asked, that she was getting soft in her old age.Of course, Sugar  did not realize this single mother would be this young and pretty. Mid-thirties. She wonders what happened to her marriage? Surely the woman had flaws. Sugar soon discovers a few. Heaven forbid, the woman does not even know how to cook, nor does she know her proper Southern graces!  Sugar must teach her a thing, or two.  . . . \u201cAt least by the end of the day, you\u2019ll know how to bake cookies and fry okra. It might be against the law for a Southern-born girl not to know how. Along with changing a tire.\u201d . . . Despite all her attempts  to keep her new tenant at arm\u2019s length, a tenuous connection had been formed. They may have more in common that they may suspect. Merilee at first thinks Sugar is a little strange and is judging her. However, soon their bond strengthens. The best award-winning part  Think: To Kill a Mockingbird This is where White always \"shines\" with the historical past and dual timelines. Sugar begins telling Merilee bits and pieces of her life on the farm as a girl during the Depression, starting from 1934. She usually is closed-mouthed about her past (in a world of oversharing), she likes keeping some things to herself. However, somehow, she feels comfortable opening up to this younger version of herself. Sugar\u2019s dark life  during the Depression in Sweet Apple provides a very different look at life compared to the present-day of the same town, especially those in Heather\u2019s world. A great addition to the story: Wade Kimball  is Willa Faye\u2019s grandson, and he looks in on Sugar. The developer, and handyman. He helps with any of the maintenance issues for Sugar and her new tenant. As Merilee and her children  begin to get settled in, she meets a variety of moms. One, in particular, Heather, which is like \u201cperfection.\u201d The perfect wife, mother, house, children, food, social standing, glamorous, clothes, and home (s) with the good-looking nice husband, Daniel. Merilee feels inferior next to her. As the kids become involved in their new school and Merilee in carpools and committees. She just wants to be accepted, like a kid at school. Peer pressure is tough. Soon her daughter comes home and tells her about this anonymous blogger. It is called: THE PLAYING FIELDS BLOG.  Observations of Suburban Life from Sweet Apple, Georgia Written by Your neighbor. Who is this person and how does she know so much about their Sweet Apple lives? The blogger dishes  out a variety of gossip and offers a few Southernism tidbits for all the newbies at the end of each installment. No one knows but they think it could be a mom at Windwood since she seems to know a lot about what goes on at school, the community, and their lives. (yes it is spicy, sassy, and oh so funny)! In the meantime, the perfectionist mother Heather at school is befriending her. Merilee gets pulled in by the attention and her affluent lifestyle. She has taken her under her wing. Merilee grabs on, desperate for new friends and acceptance. Looks can be deceiving. Of course, Sugar does not trust her. A backstory. Merilee also has a mysterious past; however, she is not so forthcoming, until it all unravels later.  Between Sugar\u2019s stories  from the past, Merilee\u2019s own drama with her wealthy friends in the present; the school, her children, her ex-husband, his girlfriend, and a baby on the way, worrying about measuring up to her new friend Heather, and the constant reminders of her life from an unknown blogger and social media \u2014she feels like she is on a reality TV show. . . . and there are some other strange happenings. Daniel and Heather are acting weird. Plus, Merilee has her own memories and guilt from the past which may be coming back to haunt her. Then someone is murdered  at the lake house (Lake Lanier). The suspicions are pointing to Merilee. Is someone setting her up? How will she prove she is innocent based on her past? What motive do they have for hurting her?From murder, attempted murder, revenge, and a tornado.  It wouldn\u2019t be the South without a little drama and deceit sprinkled with some sugar. Female friendships are at the heart of this page-turner. 5 Stars +++ Top books of 2017!  Move this one to the TOP of your list. You are going to love it!

Merilee Dunlap is recently divorced and rents a cottage in Sweet Apple, Georgia from Sugar Prescott, the sourpuss grand dame of Sweet Apple. Poor Merilee is overwhelmed with her job, her kids, and moving to a new town. As Merilee and Sugar slowly get to know each other, various secrets emerge, and events that none of them foresee begin to unfold. While I loved every aspect of the book, my favorite part was the way White chose to tell the story. The book alternates between a mixture of a clever blog written by the anonymous \u201cYour Neighbor\u201d, a standard present day story line, and a narration by 93-year-old Sugar Prescott of various events from her early life. This synthesis of storytelling techniques produces a unique reading experience which I thoroughly enjoyed. Frequently when various time periods are used in a novel, I will like one story line much better than the other, but here I loved every aspect of the book and couldn\u2019t wait for each new development.White\u2019s characters are well-crafted and very authentic. While I was partial to a variety of the characters, Sugar Prescott is a clear stand out who I have thought about so many times since I finished The Night the Lights Went Out. She is a true literary gem.I highly, highly recommend this book and cannot wait to hear everyone else rave about it as much as I have been to everyone I know.

It\u2019s gorgeous and though the ebook version (which I read) is pretty enough, I\u2019m ordering a physical copy too. The Night the Lights Went Out is a perfect blending of genres with a southern flair, it has drama, intrigue, betrayals, history, a small dose of romance, truly something for everyone. Plus, it\u2019s set in Georgia which always makes a fantastic setting in my opinion. Merilee moves into a new home following her divorce with her two young children, Lily and Colin. She rents a place from Sugar, a life long resident of Sweet Apple, Georgia. Though these two seemingly have little in common, their proximity allows them to strike up an unlikely friendship and discover they may have a whole lot more in common than meets the eye. I felt for Merilee right from the start, we\u2019re the same age and imagining trying to start my life over in a small, tight knit is terrifying. Especially when it\u2019s a small town in the south, some of the grown women in this book were worse than Regina George in Mean Girls! Sugar took me a little while longer to warm up to, she\u2019s a bit crotchety but as she slowly shares her past with Merilee, I begin to really empathize with her. Both women were so deeply developed, resulting in characters that will stay with me for a long time. I simply loved everything about this book, it was super entertaining, magically blending past and present as Merilee and Sugar both narrated sections. There are also sections from an anonymous blogger who only will reveal they\u2019re a neighbor, preferring to keep their identity a secret, but they dispense some great life lessons and hilarious southern sayings. I did figure out a plot twist, but I was having such a fun time reading this, I didn\u2019t even care. It beautifully captures small town Southern life and had enough gossip and whisperings to make it even more juicy."}, {"userName": "Abby Welker", "userReviewDate": "Jun 14, 2017", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/756268-abby-welker", "userReview": "I have NO IDEA how this book has been rated so highly. I was actually quite excited to read this book based on all of the rave reviews. Pretty much every cliche regarding women, Southern women, best friends, crushing on the guy next door, and revenge stories was included in this book. I mean, cliche all the way to the END, including \"a best friend is someone, who, when you ask her to help you bury a body, she asks for a shovel...\" (gag and eye roll) I couldn't end this book fast enough...so happy I can move on to something (hopefully) more interesting.***SPOILERS***I MEAN SERIOUSLY......I get it that Marilee was a recent divorce, but are women really that naive?! And do they really fall for a guy that fast after getting a divorce?! And did she really not recognize a girl whom she went to school with and tormented?! I belive that plastic surgery, cosmetics, fitness, and hair color can make a person look quite different, which is what I'm assuming happened with Heather, but SERIOUSLY. Marilee giving out her phone & Facebook passwords and the spot she hides her spare key to get into her house?! Honestly. Also, I knew the whole time that it was Sugar who was writing the secret blog posts. Those were actually the only decent parts of the story for me. And seriously? Heather was that cold-hearted to kill her husband with a stiletto?! Oh, and my ultimate favorite part to hate about this book is the fact that the whole revenge break-in happened on.....get this......a stormy night!!! With a tornado!!! Merilee makes bail, comes home and, naturally, she'd want a bath because that's how all horror movies are written, right?! And then...the house looses power, of course, because of the storm and they fight in the dark....with flashes of lightning giving away the position of each other!! (the suspense, right?!)

Merilee has secrets, she has that look in her eye that she has experienced loss and lived on. She is resilient and strong.Sugar her elderly landlady recognises Merilee's qualities and even though Sugar is known for her crustiness, Merillee is not long in discovering the woman has a heart and eye that sees and cares.

Her life connects with Merilee in many ways, they have seen similar things and their hearts understand and connect.Then there is \"the blog\" from your local neighbor that comments on life in the town and the people there in. It tells it like it is and makes connections, often going against the local gossip and innuendo. It is full of southern says which I totally adored, down to earth sayings that made me ponder, like \" You can't tell the size of the turnips by lookin' at the tops\". And so many more. Who is the author of the blog? Well that's just one small secret in a book that abounds in secrets.Every detail that is dropped foreshadowing something is followed up. Nothing is left dangling.

Sweet Apple, Georgia is the quintessential Southern town and of course everyone knows everyone's business. She is renting a charming cottage on Sugar Prescott's farm, an older woman who has a no nonsense reputation around town. Merilee's children are starting over at a private school, but things are a bit different than she expected. The other moms are very high maintenance and are helicopter parents. Think Desperate Housewives meets Gone with the Wind. While trying to figure out her place in all of this, Merilee meets another mother, Heather, who takes her under her wing. Heather is pretty much the Queen Bee of Sweet Apple and they surprisingly hit it off. Thanks to Heather, Merilee finds her niche in the community, volunteers for a committee at school, and meets a whole new world of people. This is all juxtaposed by Sugar and her way of life, which is entirely different than Heather's. Sugar grew up when things were different in the South and is the polar opposite of Heather. Sugar is all about farming, home cooked meals, no technology, and other remnants of days gone by in Georgia. Although Sugar doesn't take to many people, she cares about Merilee since she is a single mom just trying to get by. Readers get to know a bit more about Sugar as we flashback to her memories of growing up on the farm and the various people that lived in Sweet Apple in the past. But as things progress for Merilee, she comes to find that behind the perfect people that live in Sweet Apple are secrets and things aren't what they seem. Perhaps things aren't so perfect after all, especially if you dig a little deeper and look closely. Karen White's The Night the Lights Went Out is a fantastic novel.

Told from three points of view, a 93 year-old small town matriarch, the main protagonist who is a recent divorcee with two children, and an anonymous town blogger, this audiobook is a must listen to gem! 15 hours went by in a flash when I listened to this intriguing title that has a little something for everyone. As I'm an avid romance book listener I think its important to note that while this title is not a traditional romance, it does have a romance undercurrent with a HFN outcome, so I also encourage romance listeners who enjoy women's fiction titles to give this book a listen.Merilee Talbot Dunlap has to start a new life after discovering that her husband had an affair with a third grade teacher from their two children's elementary school. Knowing that the kids would never survive the gossip at their old school, Merilee moves with her two children to the small, affluent town and Atlanta suburb of Sweet Apple, Georgia. Think of Sweet Apple as a yuppie, small town where roundabouts, SUVs, and coffee shops abound. Of course the exclusive private school that Merilee enrolls her children in is no different and Merilee quickly is thrown into the rich culture even as she's adopted by the \"queen\" of the town, Heather Blackford. But Merilee is not as rich as the town's inhabitants and is only able to afford the expensive private school because her ex-husband's parents are paying for it, so keeping up with the Joneses is not easy for Merilee. Fortunately, and yet unexpectedly, Heather tries to ease some of this burden by subsidizing some of its social burdens as well as by including Merilee on some of the prestigious school committees and inviting her to exclusive town parties. Further helping Merilee make ends meet is the fact that she was fortunate to have found a sublet from Sugar, the 93 year-old matriarch of the town whose family at one point owned much of the land. At the same time that Merilee is developing her relationship with Heather, she is also slowly developing a parallel relationship with Sugar (to the town's great surprise because Sugar has not been particularly friendly to many people much less allowed them to sublet from her). Then there is also Sugar's best friend's grandson who starts visiting Merilee to help out with home projects and they start forming a bond, and Merilee's ex-husband, and even Heather's husband who due to the frequent get-togethers between Merilee and Heather, also begins to form a friendship with Merilee. However, not all is what it seems, and secrets and sins pervade the small town. Additionally, as the anonymous town's blogger seems to see all, and starts revealing some gossip worthy observations, Merilee is put in some rather uncomfortable positions (especially as her children also seem to be aware of the blog). Just who are her true friends and who in Sweet Apple can Merilee truly count on? The Night the Lights Went Out is narrated in a somewhat unusual and yet especially fitting fashion for a book that is told from 3 POVs. Therefore it is no surprise that we have three narrators: Carolyn Cook , Susan Larkin, and Tiffany Morgan. I must admit that as all three narrators are new to me and all narrate from a female character's perspective, I'm not really sure which narrator reads which POV. However, I can tell you that one narrator is assigned to each of the 3 POVs being shared: Merilee's, Sugar's, and the anonymous blogger's. This style works well to differentiate the POVs. Additionally as Sugar's passages are told from the past (revealing things that happened to her and her family and friends in Sweet Apple when she was a child/young adult), it also helps differentiate whether the story is being told in the present or past tense. The narrator who narrates the blogger's perspective has a perfect snarky tone as you would except someone revealing some tongue-in-cheek gossip which I thought worked perfectly in this book. Sugar's narrator in turn gives Sugar a much more pronounced Southern and elderly sound which I thought also worked well for her passages too. Merilee's narrator, as you would expect of the main protagonist, had the heaviest load of the narration burden. This narrator does a relatively good job in most aspects juggling the large cast that plays a part in Merilee's passages. Perhaps my only critical observation of this narrator, however, is that while she excelled at delivering distinguishable female characters, her male characters were all pretty similar in pitch (and not very deep, so somewhat similar to some of her female characters) making it a little more difficult to differentiate the male characters just by her voice.All in all, this is one of the best suspense/thriller and women's fiction titles I have listened to this year. I found every aspect well done: from the dual unfolding of the current mystery and the revelation of the past one to the bilateral parallel stories of how \"friendships\" both aided and led to the evolution of these mysteries. This is a book that will leave you both questioning who your true friends are as well as appreciating how necessary true friendships are to a life well lived.This was my first Karen White book, and wow was I impressed! I will definitely be looking to listen to more of her titles in the near future.Source: Review copy provided for review purposes."}, {"userName": "Dale Harcombe", "userReviewDate": "May 30, 2018", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/4800708-dale-harcombe", "userReview": "Three and a half starsAfter her divorce, Merilee Dunlap moves with her two children to Sweet Apple Georgia.

The anonymous blogger seems to know all that is going on in town and comments on various other aspects of people\u2019s lives.

It's like I forget what an amazing writer she is and how well she weaves a story. Those are just a couple of the reasons she is one of my all time favorite authors and on my auto-buy list.The Night the Lights Went Out completely captivated me. In the beginning, it was the writing that did it. The southern setting of Sweet Apple Georgia was beautifully described. I could hear the characters' Southern accents as I read the book. Not too long after beginning, it was the plot that kept my attention. The four points of view that delivered it were very engaging.First, there was Merliee. She was a recent divorc\u00e9e trying to navigate her new world. She had recently moved into a rental house on Sugar Prescott's land, and her children were attending a new private school. Merliee was trying to develop new friendships with other parents and Sugar. Trying to fit in was stressful for her. I found it very easy to relate to. Making friends in your adult years is really hard.The second and third point of views were both Sugar's. One was her current 90-something-year-old current day voice. Sugar was crotchety and stubborn, but a great person underneath her rough exterior. She saw people for who they really were. The old lady made me smile a lot. Sugar's second perspective was told through stories of her past. Bit by bit, she unfolded the mystery of her life. I loved learning how Sugar become the strong, outspoken woman she was today from her history.The fourth and final perspective was an anonymous blogger. The blogger claimed to have all the insight into what was happening in Sweet Apple. The blog gave insight into not just local business and construction happenings, but also social gossip. What showed up on the blog was scandalous.All four perspectives wove into a couple of different fascinating mysteries. The first, I mentioned above about Sugar's past. The second involves things that begin happening after Merilee makes some new friendships with parents from her children's school. The mysteries weren't too hard to figure out. I may have guessed some major plot twists early on, but it didn't keep me from enjoying the book. It actually made the revelations all that more fun.The Night the Lights Went Out was truly a great women's fiction/mystery read. I enjoyed every minute I spent with it.

You can't have a swarm of Upper East Side-wannabe moms in Range Rovers and yoga pants in what essentially is a 2017 cartoon of a one-stoplight town. You cannot have your pound cake and eat it, too.Apart from that, this book's main (and fatal) flaw is the lack of any real drive to the plot. An anonymous blogger is writing... what? true things, and they are just not that scandalous. In truth, the anonymous blogger is the only voice in the story whose writing is interesting-- but even that didn't make me care enough to wonder who the writer is!! The main character drifts along in her busy life (so busy, in fact, that she takes frequent breaks to perfect sweet tea and cookie recipes with her landlady) wondering which man is in love with her today. Even Sugar, who is a moderately interesting character with regard to her past and her perspectives on old age and modernity, had nothing in her plot line to make me turn the pages asking, \"Ooh what will happen next?\"2 stars, DNF with only about 15% left because  I just did not care."}, {"userName": "Lisa", "userReviewDate": "May 17, 2017", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/15493045-lisa", "userReview": "A fabulously sparkling southern book about new and unexpected friendships and the keeping of secrets. SUMMARYKaren White tells a story of friendships that develops between three intriguing women when Merilee Talbot Dunlap moves to Sweet Apple, Georgia, not far from Atlanta. Merilee has just divorced her husband of eleven years after discovering he not only was having an affair with, but had also gotten their daughter's third grade math teacher pregnant. Devastated, Marilee and her two children, Lily age 10, and Colin age 8, give up their house, furniture and Mercedes SUV to begin a new life.The first person Merrilee meets in Sweet Apple is the long-time widow Sugar Prescott who greets the trio at her farmhouse with a batch of chocolate chip cookies. They had sugar on sell at Kroger, she says. Sugar is the town's 93 year old matriarch, her family had at one time owned much of the property in the county, before her older brothers had chosen to sell it off. Sugar has agreed to rent Merrilee the old cottage behind her farmhouse. Having heard about Marilee's divorce from a realtor, Sugar suspected that Merilee was suddenly and unexpected on her own and in need of help. She understood that need. Sugar is quick to disapprove of Merilee serving her children pizza, and even more appalled to find out that Merilee can't cook. Sugar takes it upon herself to give Merilee cooking lessons. Merilee and Sugar form a strong bond as they share stories, and ultimately the secrets from their past. Merilee meets Heather Blackford the first day of school at Winwood Acadamy. Heather is the epitome of southern perfection: rich, blond, glowy, dressed in tennis whites, and driving a Porsche SUV with a trunk full of gift bags for all the kids on their first day of school. She is just to much. She is the class mother and heads up the school upcoming Gala. While there is no love lost between Heather and Sugar, Heather takes a shine to Merilee and just demands that she chair the fundraising auction at the gala. The gala is held at Heather's beautiful mansion on Lake Lanier. It's a huge success and everyone is dress to the nines. At the end of the evening Merilee discovers a body floating in the lake. Several days later, Merilee is brought into the police station as a suspect for the murder. \"You only need one really good friend to get you through the hard stuff.\"Humor, southern charm and wisdom are being dispensed to the Sweet Apple, Georgia community in the form of a new blog titled \"The Playing Fields: Observations of Suburban Life in Sweet Apple, Georgia...\" which is tagged as \"Your Neighbor.\" Sweet Apple folks are abuzz wondering who this anonymous blogger could possibly be and how do they know so much. REVIEWThis was my first book by the best selling author, Karen White, and l was so impressed by the depth of her character development and the breadth of the story she tells. This story was both immediately engaging and entertaining. Can't wait to read more Karen White books! Thanks to my friend, Marion Hoffman for the recommendation!The overall story alternates between Merilee and Sugar. Sugar's portion of the story occasional jumps from the 2016 to the 1930's and 1940''s for Sugar's backstory. These transitions and jumps in the book are effortless for the reader. I absolutely loved the inclusion of the \"The Playing Fields\" blog. The posts are creatively interspersed throughout the book and add much humor and levity. And while White keeps the the Sweet Apple community in the dark about the identity of the blogger, you will know who it is at the end, if not before!And what's not love about Sugar Prescott. She is by far my favorite character in the whole book. She reminds me so much of my grandmother, Mamie, who was born and raised in Magee, Mississippi. Everyone in town knew Mamie. She was always baking something wonderful. Mamie cooked lunch for the Lion Club every Wednesday for 30 years and she made the best fried chicken, chicken and dumplings, and sweet pickles ever! And she was not shy about telling people what she thought, just like Sugar. The Night The Light Went Out has so many intertwining stories that the book is definitely not boring. There are friends to meet, stories to uncover, secrets to share and mysteries to solve. Throw in a romance, a tornado and the lights going out and this book is just down right great! Favorite Quotes:\"Life shouldn't be an unbroken road of wonderful. It's the curves in the road that build character and show us our mettle.\"\"Life's journey doesn't mean much without friends.\"\"Every path has its puddles, but that doesn't mean we shouldn't travel them. We just need to remember to wear our boots and bring our friends and those who love us.\""}], "description": "15 hours, 19 minutesFrom the New York Times bestselling author of the Tradd Street series comes a stunning new novel about a young single mother who discovers that the nature of friendship is never what it seems....Recently divorced, Merilee Talbot Dunlap moves with her two children to the Atlanta suburb of Sweet Apple, Georgia.
