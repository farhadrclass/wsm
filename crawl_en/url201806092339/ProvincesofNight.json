If you took what I love about Cormac McCarthy, and what I love about Justified, and what I love about home, the center of that Venn diagram is this book.Meaning, there wasn\u2019t a pleasure center in my brain this didn\u2019t light up like Cleveland. Meaning, if there were any folks I\u2019d bring to life out of a book it\u2019s the Bloodworths out of this one.* * *January 2013: If this was my favorite book of 2011, and my favorite book of 2012, kicking the year off with it means it can be my favorite book of 2013 too, right?

The story itself is good, but it takes the more scenic route home at times and sort of floats around in a way that makes it all feel a bit meditative. I actually loved it for that drowsy quality and read it slowly over several days.Provinces of Night is simultaneously a coming-of-age story, a search for redemption and reparation, a comedy, a tragedy, and a history of Fleming Bloodworth's extremely dysfunctional family. Gay's lush prose borders on poetry and his characters are so realistically developed that you find yourself suspecting that they were based on real people. Some of it is bright and laugh out loud funny - especially the episodes with Fleming's friend Junior Albright (who is not at all bright) and his Uncle Warren - but it's also dark and deeply tragic. What ties it all together is Gay's Gothic tone and painterly writing style. Masterpiece quality. \"The sky was absolutely cloudless and so blue it looked transparent and against it a wave of blackbirds shifted shapeless as smoke.\u201d"}, {"userName": "Chrissie", "userReviewDate": "Dec 22, 2014", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/632247-chrissie", "userReview": "Do you have a clear idea of what makes a Southern Gothic novel? I didn't before. I do now. Macabre tone, deeply flawed characters, a dash of voodoo, a derelict setting, sinister events, poverty, crime and violence. All this is delivered in the novel, but adjectives just don't draw the picture as well as Gay's story does. The first half of the novel didn't deliver; the second half did. The first half is terribly slow. The momentum builds at the end. The author often doesn't clarify who he is speaking of. You think it is one person only to discover it is another. Very annoying, confusing and difficult to follow. By the books end you do end up understanding though. With the change of a paragraph the story can shift to a new person and place. You are given no warning and the characters are not necessarily specified; they are referred to as he or she! I found this annoying because the information I had just absorbed had been associated with the wrong individual. Rewinding and re-listening in an audiobook is a pain. Some of the lines are really good, and that is what kept me reading! Had it not been for the end I would never have given the book three stars! It is not a particularly neat ending but satisfying nevertheless. I understand the characters. I understand what happened. After struggling so hard this is in itself an achievement. The book is about a father, his three sons and two grandsons. Their women too. Messy relationships. Not all bad, but certainly not all good. Remember, this is a Southern Gothic novel!I hated the narration by Dick Hill, but as usual this does not affect my rating. When I listen to his narration I get the feeling that he thinks he is doing a stupendous dramatization. Others like theatrics; I don't. I had to think of the words and close out what I heard.

E.F. is a character not soon to be forgotten, similar to Larry Brown's Wade (see the books \"Joe\" and \"Fay\"). Both characters are old men doing scandalous acts - some funny and some not - but unforgettable nonetheless. The Provinces of Night is another excellent book by William Gay. He is soon becoming my favorite. This story encompasses so much that this review will not do it justice. I simply loved it. I loved the characters, the setting, and the language. Gay certainly had a talent with the written word. If I highlighted every sentence that struck me most of the book would be underlined. But what took me most by surprise was the humor which was not as profound in his previous book \"The Long Home\". There were several parts that had me in tears - literally. My favorite was the disastrous account of Fleming driving Warren and his \"accountant\". Downright hilarious. I was reading at work and couldn't stop laughing:Now you're catchin on, Warren said. This flat black thing, I think that's what we're supposed to be drivin on.

I am writing this review in part to debunk that concept; forgive me there will be a soapbox section at the tail-end. Before I get wound up though, the take away here is that this book touches all the bases to be great. It does more than touch each base; it slides hard into all of them....first and home included. It's a great character story. Fleming is pure hero. He's a high school dropout who is an academic by his own inert nature yet he hangs with and loves those who despise the finer points of living. EF is the deadbeat everyone loves, respects, and admires. Able to charm the uncharmable. A fighter, a lover, a magical being that tips his hat, tips his waitresses, and tips the scales in his own favor more often than not. Despite all these magnetisms, he\u2019s the character you might call a \"loser\" if your real life ever crossed his path. I hate that admission because in my view this character may actually be autobiographic for Mr. Gay who I hate I'll now never have to opportunity to meet in real life. The book ends in a place that will leave the characters parked in your mind for a long time to come......wondering, hoping, believing (in that order). There are two opposite love stories each with their own twists, caveats, and conclusions. There are small side scenes that develop plot, setting, and character all at the same time. The snake in the path of cedars might be my favorite scene of all time. There was the perfect amount of musical and literary reference to other work that created intrigue but was not overdone to the point of making it seem forced. Unlike some books I esteem, there are tinges of victory over despair; fear not, desperation and ill-fated circumstance still abound. The rare and selfish feeling of not wanting to loan this text out after finishing despite my desire that others experience it triggers my wee small voice of guilt; give me a few weeks and I might let you read my copy. Now, for those trumpeting Gay only as a McCarthy mimicker....I would disagree. Certainly, he likely is an enthusiast like the rest of us (Heaven forbid one author be a \"fanboy\" of another). I can obviously see the links. The similarities between Bellwether (as just one example) and some of McCarthy's characters come to mind. I think he uses hawks caught in thermals very similarly. At times, I felt influences and overtones from The Orchard Keeper, Suttree, heck even Child of God was in there in places. Most of us who dwell around in this genre might take the same kinds of steps (not mistakes) if we set out to write our own tales. Gay's dive into these parallels was clearly conscious. Had he not \"wanted\" to draw those comparisons he was clearly gifted enough to avoid creating this discussion. Our life's flavor is seasoned with those we respect the most. For that matter, McCarthy (whom I love) took pieces of Faulkner and O'Conner and then developed his own unique voice. Gay represents his own voice in that same manner. He has an ability to say things that are profound and deep very simplistically. While he doesn\u2019t require the same bedside dictionary as McCarthy, he writes with such master that almost no one could do something so elaborate but plain at the same time. It is akin to McCarthy without the distraction. Sometimes the distraction of McCarthy makes it hard to hear the alarm bells that need to be going off. McCarthy is better on second read than first. Most who would try to make McCarthyisms more digestible would not be able to evoke the same HUGE trains of thought. Gay accomplishes that in ways that we all SHOULD be able to do but can't. I love them both; two castoffs not looking for rescue on different islands (or better yet desolate, God forsaken stands of scrub pine) than point toward the same moon at the same dusky hour."}, {"userName": "Kirk Smith", "userReviewDate": "Jan 17, 2014", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/15749169-kirk-smith", "userReview": "I just found this author, and I could not be more thrilled.

A blue-collar worker with the soul of a poet, Gay read Thomas Wolfe, Cormac McCarthy and Flannery O'Connor when he wasn't painting houses or hanging drywall. Although he wrote for most of his life, his work was continually rejected by the literary scene. Finally, at 58 he published his first novel and the next year a bidding war ensued for Provinces of Night. He died at 70.\nThese hours before first light were merciless. You could not go back to sleep and it was too early to get up and the things you had done or not done lay in your mind immovable as misshapen things you'd erected from stone. There was no give to these hours. They took no prisoners, made no compromises, and the things you had done could not be rationalized into anything save things you had done.\nProvinces of Night is pure southern gothic, kindling with violence, beauty, and deep insight into the conflicting longings of human nature. It's about the ties of blood and their power to drown, the unforeseen karma of violence that flows far into the future, life (or death) affirming sex, and maybe, sometimes, love. It's about the Bloodworth Family: the grand patriarch E.F., his sons Brady, Boyd and Warren; but it's mostly about 17-year-old Fleming, EF's grandson, abandoned by his parents to fend for himself with little more than a roof over his head and a wood burning stove. Fleming is on his own, but he has a toughness that only deep country can breed and a kindness the men of his family never had.\nThat's the craziest thing I ever heard in my life, his grandmother said. . . If sense was gunpowder, ever one of you men put together wouldn't have enough to load a round of birdshot.\nThe tenaciously self-destructive men and hard rural culture of Provinces reminded me of Daniel Woodrell's Winter's Bone. Fleming embodies a beautifully male version of Dee Rolley with grit born from hardship and an inner moral compass many around him don't seem to have. Life is unforgiving and its lessons hard, but Fleming never utters a single word of self-pity. It doesn't cross his mind.\nListen, he said vehemently. Somebody's going to have to say what they really mean and then do what they say they will. All this lying. All this bullshit and pretending. It's just wasting lives, wasting time, everything's just a waste.She looked at him curiously. That's just the way people are. The way the world is. What are you trying to do, fix the world?I don't want to fix the world. Fuck the world. Just the little part of it that I have to live on.\nThis is true literary fiction. It's not plot driven. It's about lives, souls, and what it means to be human. It's about how a young man with the odds stacked against him can possibly learn to survive the soul-shaking brutality and \"appalling beauty of life.\"\nHe had no faith in the permanence of any of this. What he's seen of life had shown him that the world had little of comfort or assurance. He suspected that there were no givens, no map through the maze. Here in falling dark with the world rolling simultaneously toward him and away from him everything seemed no more than random. Life blindsides you so hard you can taste the bright copper blood in your mouth then it beguiles you with a gift of profound and appalling beauty.\nWilliam Gay knew a lot about life. While he was fixing houses and earning his daily bread, he was also watching, listening and taking everything in. I want to read everything he wrote, soak in his vision of the world, and hear its music."}, {"userName": "Carl R.", "userReviewDate": "May 16, 2012", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/9314075-carl-r", "userReview": "Let us now sing the praises of William Gay, which I have done twice before over the last months.

There\u2019s itchy Mama, Sheriff Bellewether, Raven Lee Halfacre, Snowwhite Caf\u00e9, Junior Albright.E.F. is a vagrant, wandering banjo picker who left his family years earlier, wants to come home to die of the stroke that has put him at death\u2019s door. Fleming is the grandson who has known E.F. only by legend. Brady is the bitter, fortune-telling, hex-fixing son who stuck by his mother through the decades of the absent dad. Warren and Boyd are the disloyal sons who drift (not too far, though) from the homesite. Raven Lee is the 16-year-old beauty with the drunken, whorish mother whom Fleming worships and adores beyond his years and his capacity to control. Junior is Fleming\u2019s ne\u2019er do well best friend, who turns out to have an unexpected yearning for penance and redemption.Powerful literary figures from our world appear throughout, Thomas Wolfe dominating, nourishing the soil of what might otherwise be simple\u2014if captivating\u2014tales of the rural folk.One of the book\u2019s first events concerns a magazine\u2019s return of a handwritten manuscript that Fleming had dreamed would be the first step on his stairway to literary success, the first instance of a constant theme of creation and loss. E.F.\u2019s banjo recordings and blues songs (soulful enough they\u2019re mistaken for Negro records) are another. Then there is Raven Lee\u2019s hunger for that blues music that so bespeaks her life.Behind it all is the story of a great flood, for the TVA is afoot, and the incipient dam will soon destroy what generations got, begot, built and buried.And then, of course, there\u2019s Gay\u2019s language. . . ..The underwater road looked inexplicable, freighted with lost meaning, like some old imponderable road an ancient race had built to a place that no longer existed.Echoes of Cormac McCarthy, worthy of William Faulkner.

His words metaphors and similes paint wonderful scenes and thoughts of our surroundings and the human condition.This story is of discovery and redeeming through loss and love. The characters are memorable and from walks of life that liven the somber soul and broaden some narrow minds.His characters in this tale live and breathe life to its edges and others modestly.Kin, brothers and one man a father a grandfather to a budding young writer Fleming whose probably the only one that admires his grandpa the blues man, wanderer of the earth and of many adventures. Fleming is wanting to be far from his kin's past and make a difference he finds love in the form of another soul a female whose also had a shady upbringing this fact brings a little light through this story on his future and wills or wills not in settling down.This was a wonderfully written human tragedy with originality and a language that some may not be accustomed that does nothing but add that extra hook to the reading experience.By the time i finished i learned two things one word of expression \"Hellfire\" and a few words \"Shall i put a HEx(curse) on him\" that will forever run in my quieter hours with a smile on my face.An underrated writer not known enough by the masses who died in 2012.Excerpts to come by sunday 30th :)Check out some great videos with William Gay doing Readings and being interviewed on the review page here>>http://more2read.com/review/provinces-of-night-by-william-gay/"}, {"userName": "Kiwi Begs2Differ  \u270e", "userReviewDate": "Oct 28, 2015", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/12287031-kiwi-begs2differ", "userReview": "Southern lit.

Problem is, I'm so in awe of the quality of William Gay's writing, that I don't think I will ever be able to post a fitting review of this novel. Perhaps after the next time I read it, I might be able to review it properly, for I will surely be returning to the Bloodworths again and again. Oh, one thing I have noted, is that William Gay always nails those awkward dialogue exchanges between two people who have the hots for each other and are trying too hard not to show it. And of course, his economic writing style is a joy from start to finish. For the moment anyway, he's my favourite author bar none."}, {"userName": "Daniel Villines", "userReviewDate": "Sep 19, 2013", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/2266055-daniel-villines", "userReview": "Update - 29 JUN 14Something that I did not mention in my review below was how impressed I was with the character, Raven Lee. She was a young girl who was placed in a life that was filled with tragic events and yet she asserts herself as a strong human force in the book. One detail of her character was that she claimed that Rebecca was her favorite book: \"[I've] probably read it a dozen times already\".But why was it her favorite book? My recent reading of Rebecca revealed that the main character was the consummate victim. In contrast, Raven Lee was a natural heroin. She had to live a life filled with hardship, she had to exercise constant assessment of her situation and maintain a constant grip on reality. The main character in Rebecca possibly allowed Raven Lee to escape while at the same time provided her with a sort of affirmation that her approach to life was necessary and right.---Original Review - 16 OCT 13Provinces of Night is a book that treats life with respect. The experiences depicted in this book reflect our day-to-day existence, which is seldom entirely good, but neither is it entirely bad. Life is comprised of moments.It's unfortunate that the moments that affect us most in life tend weigh upon our spirits simply because we cannot ignore them. The angry client and the random rock into the windshield hit us with their full force and effect as they happen. The pleasant moments in life tend to pass us by. You have to look for happiness and being preoccupied by the unpleasant blinds us from finding the good in the events that affect us, and more importantly, the good in the people that surround us.Provinces of Night walks us through life, one event at a time. It slows down our rapid-fire linear existence to succinct moments. And through it all, we find out that there is indeed plenty of bad, but Gay also focuses our attention on the good. In fact, the good things in life (and in this book) may actually outnumber the bad. But this conclusion is a matter of attention, perspective, and attitude; things that the main character, Fleming Bloodworth, has in abundance.Lastly, I offer up a final thought on the four-star rating. I could have easily selected five stars for this book. However, the South is a place that escapes me. I may feel the South in my heritage in much the same way I recognize my existence in the lives of my young nephews. However, I find it to be disingenuous to award perfection to a book that encompasses a place that is central to its being but not adequately understood by this reader."}, {"userName": "Justin Haynes", "userReviewDate": "Sep 13, 2012", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/6621773-justin-haynes", "userReview": "PROVINCES OF NIGHT by William Gay is just one hell of a good book. Gay introduces the reader to the totally dysfunctional and continually entertaining Bloodworth family and takes the reader on a wild ride through the hills of Tennessee as we uncover what it means to be family, to fall in love, to forgive, and to try to make amends.With his second published novel Gay relied even more heavily on the Southern Gothic motifs and he does it well. PROVINCES OF NIGHT will keep you laughing as you fall more in love with each of the finely crafted characters.But don't for a minute think this is some easy going comedy. Gay shows the bleak nature of humanity in all it's form. He shows how desperate some are to run away from their problems and he shows how desperate some are to confront them no matter the cost.In the end I suppose PROVINCES OF NIGHT deserves any and all accolades it has received and continues to receive. I'm often reminded when reading a book like PROVINCES OF NIGHT just how different us in the south may really be to the rest of the country. So conversations leading to utter human depravity or so casual and easy going that it's hard to forget some things are meant to shake you.Finally, this bears repeating. It is an absolute shame that we lost William Gay this past year. My only hope is that the wheel will keep turning and eventually another writer will come along to craft and tell the stories that he tried to tell."}, {"userName": "Jo\u00e3o Carlos", "userReviewDate": "Aug 06, 2014", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/17544299-jo-o-carlos", "userReview": "William Gay (1941 - 2012)\u201cDom\u00ednios da Noite\u201d segundo romance do norte-americano William Gay (1941 - 2012) decorre na ruralidade do Tennessee na d\u00e9cada de 1950.Retrato de tr\u00eas gera\u00e7\u00f5es da fam\u00edlia Bloodworth \u00e9 no jovem Fleming - aspirante a escritor, abandonado pelo seu pai Boyd e pela sua m\u00e3e; que lhe queima uma caixa de livros, \u201cexpressando em definitivo o seu desprezo pelo mundo da escrita, por aqueles que liam e por aqueles que tentariam transcrever essa emo\u00e7\u00e3o em infind\u00e1veis blocos de notas.\u201d \u2013 que se centra uma narrativa na melhor tradi\u00e7\u00e3o americana do fatalismo e da simplicidade ret\u00f3rica, formulada por um estilo dominado pela tens\u00e3o e pelos excessos, enquadrada por personagens amb\u00edguas e sombrias, que se movimentam no limite do desespero e da frustra\u00e7\u00e3o existencial.

Easily one of the best books I've read this year. Like others have mentioned, the writing style of William Gay is very reminiscent of Cormac McCarthy, taking what at first glance is ugly or mundane and like a master craftsman, shaping and sculpting and molding until something beautiful and profound remains. But unlike McCarthy, Gay adds sprinklings of dark humor to make the story feel more immediate and human. Maybe more like a mashup of McCarthy and Larry McMurtry. This is a story filled with unforgettable and flawed characters, some oblivious and selfish, others striving for meaning and redemption. The whole time you are reading you're telling yourself to slow down, to let the writing wash over you, to revel in some of the most imaginative, immediate and precise mental images Gay's use of simile and metaphors calls forth, undeniably specific and wholly original, but you can't because you have to find out where all this is leading. Superb writing and a moving story, equal parts vengeance and redemption.

With a wild raucous humor on display on nearly every page this is a novel of the old south that that avoids sentiment and nostalgia. A wider tapestry then his first, while the ghosts of Cormac McCarthy\u2019s Tennessee are still evident (taking its title from a line in Child of God), this is closer to Faulkner with a dissection of an eccentric family as its focus. So in short this novel is a comic southern gothic with ribald humor and a soundtrack of old weird America."}, {"userName": "William", "userReviewDate": "Aug 26, 2013", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/10400389-william", "userReview": "Open the book to nearly any page and you will find some of the most beautiful, poetic descriptions of the natural surroundings, ironically inhabited by poor hillbillies trying to scratch out a life for themselves.

My dad recommended this for me, telling me the whole story about how William Gay didn\u2019t start writing until he was 60, only wrote three books, and then died; but upon his death his works had been praised and his talent finally finding a bit of mainstream exposure. Granted, my dad recommends everything he reads, so I was prepared to take this with a grain of salt (especially when I didn\u2019t really buy this book, but he left it for me after a visit without really mentioning that he was doing it \u2013 and in the future I\u2019m sure he\u2019ll declare I stole it from him\u2026); but it was entirely excellent in every which way, and I hope he continues to gain exposure. His style borrows a lot from Cormac McCarthy, and a lot of critics have compared him to Flannery O\u2019Conner and William Faulkner. I don\u2019t really see the latter two; just because he writes about Tennessee it has to be lumped in with the Southern Gothic genre? I guess there are some Gothic aspects to it, and it certainly focuses on characters with a very \u201csouthern\u201d way of thinking: many of his characters\u2019 actions are portrayed in a way to demonstrate a certain \u201cmoral code\u201d or a certain \u201cwandering lifestyle.\u201d Whether that\u2019s just his characters and his story or \u201cthe southern way\u201d I guess remains to be argued. But Cormac McCarthy \u2013 I see a lot of \u201cSuttree\u201d and his others in this novel: the young protagonist, the wandering in the woods, the humorous side characters among the more cold-hearted side characters, the self sufficiency attitude just trying to get by, the backwoods bootleg whiskey drinkers/makers. And the characters in this are so unique, so strongly portrayed. For such a short novel (287 pages) I feel like the characterization is dynamic enough to make these characters stick with me. Each is so vibrant, so vividly rendered, so realistically portrayed. Each could dominate the novel and be THE main character \u2013 Raven, beautiful, born to a drunken whore, the love interest; Neal, the asshole, trouble-making friend; Albright, the comic relief, sidekick, but ultimately displaying an \u201cinner code\u201d in his actions; EF, the grandfather, returning home after running off, the banjo-playing folk music legend; Brady, the uncle, placing hexes on people and displaying the \u201cblood is blood\u201d motif in good ways and bad. The way each character interacts with others, the way their storylines bisect and diverge, is simply masterful. And Gay\u2019s writing style is something to behold as well. I found myself thinking of Daniel Woodrell a lot (after finishing Winter\u2019s Bone recently) while reading this. Gay\u2019s writing had the same economy of language, where each sentence packs such a punch, drips with such meaning. Much as the way Ree navigates her world of backwoods meth makers, here we see Flemming navigating his world of backwoods drinkers and whiskey makers. The entire world is portrayed as clearly as if it were right in front of your eyes, as if these characters were just across the river, living in a completely different world. I loved everything about this book. Even the way it ended was unique, with each storyline stopping in a way that almost seems a tad quickly, unresolved, yet does in fact provide solid conclusions in each and every case, even tying together in an ultimate authorial statement on life, bringing the entire book to a perfect conclusion. I\u2019m immediately buying his other two, and my dad will not be getting this back. I guess I\u2019m stealing it after all."}, {"userName": "PennsyLady (Bev)", "userReviewDate": "Aug 07, 2013", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/12364449-pennsylady-bev", "userReview": "Provinces Of Night by William Gay4.5*As we are introduced to Gay's characters, it's 1952 in rural Tennessee.Two important elements of the 1952 backdrop - the valley is about to be buried under a lake by the Tennessee Valley Authority and the nation enters the Korean War.E.F.

down the book, I had no immediate reaction. William Gay's story is so unique that I've taken a few weeks to write a review. The immediate take away was, 'good story,' but I knew there was more to it than only that. I didn't wish to trivialize the book so I waited until I had time to completely digest what I read before writing. At the story's core, is the questioning of the ever popular idiom \"does the apple fall far from the tree?\" Fleming Bloodworth, in his late teens, is the youngest of the three generations of men disclosed. Fleming's father, uncles, and grandfather have all led destructive lifestyles and the table is set for him to follow in their steps. Something about Fleming seems different than his elders, probably the existence of a conscience. Before the story begins, his mother abandoned him to follow a man to Detroit. His father pursues her, deserting Fleming overnight in the shack they occupy in Ackerman's Field, Tennessee. His grandmother and uncle live near, but his uncle's belief in magic doesn't enchant Fleming so he tries to stay far away. His banjo playing, blues singing grandfather returns to the town after decades of abandonment. His other uncle is wealthy but is an an adulterer and alcoholic and his cousin is spoiled and living life in the fast lane, bound for a head-on collision. His elderly grandmother, who has indian blood, has a brain that is slowly decaying, and has been kept in the dark about her husband's return. No reasonable person could fault Fleming for succumbing to the family legacy. The character who enticed me the most was Fleming's friend Albright. Gay writes about him with an aura of mystique that made me want to read more and more about him. Not much is revealed about his past other than that his father is or was (hard to tell what his tense is) off his rocker and Albright is considered the same by the locals. He becomes a bona fide component of the story when he becomes a patron of Fleming's uncle when he seeks his services to curse an enemy.Another key element of the story is the damming of a nearby river that is going to cause parts of Ackerman's field to be underwater in the near future. Gay writes about the destruction the landscape by way of chainsaw and bulldozer with precision and thoroughness. Provinces is powerful, intoxicating, and humbling. It's a must read for all fans of the southern gothic genre."}], "description": "The year is 1952, and E.F. Bloodworth has returned to his home - a forgotten corner of Tennessee - after twenty years of roaming. The wife he walked out on has withered and faded. His three sons are grown and angry. Warren is a womanising alcoholic; Boyd is driven by jealousy to hunt down his wife's lover; and Brady puts hexes on his enemies from his mother's porch. Only Fleming, the old man's grandson, treats him with respect and sees past all the hatred, realising the way it can poison a man's soul. It is ultimately the love of Raven Lee, a sloe-eyed beauty from another town, that gives Fleming the courage to reject his family's curse.In a tale redolent with the crumbling loyalties and age-old strife of the post-war American South made familiar to us by Cormac McCarthy, Gay's characters inhabit a world driven by blood ties that strangle as they bind. A coming of age novel, a love story, and a portrait of a family torn apart, Provinces of Night introduced a distinctive new voice in American fiction and a superb cast of characters.", "title": "Provinces of Night", "url": "http://www.goodreads.com/book/show/294731.Provinces_of_Night", "average": 4.2, "cover": "https://images.gr-assets.com/books/1347680877l/294731.jpg", "reviews": 196, "authors": [{"url": "https://www.goodreads.com/author/show/62659.William_Gay", "name": "William Gay"}], "type": ["Fiction", "Gothic", "Historical", "American", "Literary Fiction"], "outlinks": ["http://www.goodreads.com/book/show/294731.Provinces_of_Night", "http://www.goodreads.com/book/show/953378.Provinces_of_Night", "http://www.goodreads.com/book/show/1608946.Provinces_of_Night", "http://www.goodreads.com/book/show/15020040-provinces-of-night", "http://www.goodreads.com/book/show/8553245-provinces-of-night", "http://www.goodreads.com/book/show/18170113-dom-nios-da-noite", "http://www.goodreads.com/book/show/108315.Twilight", "http://www.goodreads.com/book/show/294733.I_Hate_To_See_That_Evening_Sun_Go_Down", "http://www.goodreads.com/book/show/972106.The_Long_Home", "http://www.goodreads.com/book/show/24998972-little-sister-death", "http://www.goodreads.com/book/show/319322.Wittgenstein_s_Lolita_and_The_Iceman"]}
