Christy Barritt certainly knows how to grab an audience and hold them spell-bound until the end of the story. You know it will all turn out okay and yet it is so scary that your mind wonders if it will. Gabby is out shopping for a wedding gown for her marriage to the love of her life, Riley, when she gets a phone call. Riley has been shot and is lying in a coma. Everything goes wrong from there on. She argues with Riley's parents and becomes distanced from them. She learns that Riley had been meeting another girl and now that girl has disappeared. Was he cheating on her? Gabby is convinced that Milton Jones, the killer from the last book, is still alive despite the fact that he was shot and fell into the river from a great height. Is he back and taking revenge on everyone who put him away- or are related to those who did? Gabby nearly becomes a victim herself before the mystery is resolved."}, {"userName": "Candy", "userReviewDate": "Dec 19, 2013", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/5589144-candy", "userReview": "I love seeing this series progress.

While I am still not fond of a serial killer with the first name of my Grandfather, I had a feeling Gabby was right. He seemed to evil to die so quickly in the last book, but then his death in this book seemed not hard enough. One would have thought getting shot and then falling eight stories from a bridge would have done the trick. But then to be killed by a tree? That\u2019s my only reason for rating this book not a five. Last book was odd that Gabbys best friend and her partner were not in at all, unless you count the five seconds of them telling her they were getting married. Then this book, they are back from their honeymoon and again, not very big characters in this one. Gabbys garbage dumpster diving, \u201cfreegan\u201dbrother isn\u2019t in this one very much either. And the Riley didn\u2019t speak at all in this until the very end. I just felt awful for Gabby. One week prior to getting married and your fianc\u00e9 is shot in the head and in a coma? That\u2019s harsh. But it was a great reminder, especially for her being a fairly new believer, God\u2019s got this, you just have to give it over to Him. Her faith wavers and you can see why. The girl is under a ton of pressure and again has some mad man out there hunting her. This time she is mostly alone. Since Riley is in a coma and she sort of shuts everyone else out. On to the next book I suppose. Since the wedding didn\u2019t happen in this one, I need to find out what happens!"}, {"userName": "Sherry Sellers", "userReviewDate": "May 14, 2017", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/62642767-sherry-sellers", "userReview": "Love this seriesGreat book kept me on the edge of my seat...was he of wasn't he..it leads you to wonder what is going to happen next....do you want to find out."}, {"userName": "Gab", "userReviewDate": "Sep 14, 2014", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/4649715-gab", "userReview": "Ok parts of this book ripped my heart out and put it back in. I almost didn't read this book thinking I wasn't up for anything too emotionally exhausting. It wasn't & instead I was treated to a Squeaky Clean story amped up to the next level that had my adrenaline pumping for much of the story. This thriller had mystery & action - but was also about a growing of Gabby's strength of character. Past books in the series even though they've been fun Gabby's been kinda zany treating murder mysteries as a game usually ending in some dramatic life threatening scene with Riley riding in to save the day. With Riley in a coma she has to save herself from danger more horrible than anything she's faced til now or support her in her crisis of faith. Gabby on a time limit juggling trying to save Riley, herself & others from different dangers.I am so glad I wasn't put off by the \"Christian\" genre tag - I was afraid I'd spend my precious reading time being preached at but I didn't feel that at all. Religion is linked to Gabby's character development in the series (and providing some interesting additional characters) but Christy just writes a good story and I'm delighted to have found her."}, {"userName": "Becky", "userReviewDate": "Jan 18, 2014", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/11763364-becky", "userReview": "Barritt is a master storyteller of romantic suspense!!Ever watch an electrical wire fray little by little and finally you know the last cord is going to break and a fire is imminent? That's the tension Barritt masterfully creates as Gabby St. Claire's erstwhile wedding day is spent at the bedside of her comatose fiance, Riley. Circumstances cause her life to worsen from there, if possible, and her faith, like her life, resembles that fraying electrical cord, ready to ignite into a helpless mess. Will God prove enough to handle her spiritual and emotional needs? Can he protect Gabby from the Jones everyone knows is dead, and Riley from his well-meaning, misguided parents? And, oh, yes, who is the new, mystery woman in Riley's life and why hasn't Gabby heard a word about her?!My blood pressure was elevated throughout the book, and I had to finish it fast so I could go to sleep peacefully.

This has to be the most trying experience Gabby has gone through yet. Her fianc\u00e9 has been shot and is in the hospital fighting for his life. While the police are investigating, they won't give Gabby any information so she tries to find answers by herself, but instead of answers, she keeps coming up with more questions. Family and friends try to help her, but she pushes them away. Throughout the book I really felt for Gabby, how much more did she have to go through. In the end Gabby does get her answers and the shooter is brought to justice. I missed the interactions between her and Riley that the other books had. However I am happy with the way it ended and loved the lighthearted joke with Gabby. The ending left me feeling content, not sad, and looking to the next in the series."}, {"userName": "Laura", "userReviewDate": "Jan 29, 2016", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/2521894-laura", "userReview": "TO LOVE, HONOR, AND PERISH is a continuation of Ms. Barritt's The Scum of All Fears. Most of Ms. Barritt's books are stand-alone, as I've read them totally out of order and wasn't lost, but this one isn't. You have to read The Scum of All Fears to even have a clue what she's talking about. TO LOVE, HONOR, AND PERISH is just as much a horror as The Scum of All Fears, but this one involves Riley being shot and in the hospital, his survival iffy. The story is flat, the characters (Gabby) not as developed as she has been, and it kind of felt to me as if the author was \"beating a dead horse.\" I didn't enjoy this book as much as I have Ms. Barritt's others, If you like cozy mysteries, there is a mystery involved, but it also seemed as if she was \"giving it all away\" though there are some red herrings thrown in, in case you miss the obvious."}, {"userName": "Doreen Marr", "userReviewDate": "Jan 23, 2016", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/39211932-doreen-marr", "userReview": "This is Book #6 in the Squeaky Clean Series by Christy Barritt. Gabby and Riley have finally made it (almost) to their wedding, but just like many love stories, there may be rocky parts. The unthinkable happens -- Riley is shot, just days before their wedding. As Gabby juggles sitting by his bedside, trying to find his shooter, and fighting for what she thinks is best for Riley (even having to fight against his well-meaning parents). In the midst of all this, she begins to have doubts about Riley's faithfulness to her. I was anxious, and fearful at the same time, to find out how it all turns out. I love mysteries, I love the characters, and I love that I can always count on suspense and clean fun."}, {"userName": "Allison Kohn", "userReviewDate": "Jan 29, 2014", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/21184249-allison-kohn", "userReview": "This gut wrenching mystery is a thrilling climax to its predecessor,The Scum of All Fears. Gabby's sense of humor escapes her as she endeavors to find out who pulled the trigger to the gun that shot the bullet into Riley's head. In spite of the fact that the humor is missing, this is a top notch mystery. It shows Gabby's personal growth - spiritual and emotional - and the supporting characters are developed well. I recommend this to anyone who loves a good mystery with character."}, {"userName": "Nichole", "userReviewDate": "Dec 11, 2013", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/8468536-nichole", "userReview": "Once again, Christy Barritt has delivered a wonderful story. While book 6 is more serious than the rest of the series, it brought to light Gabby's struggle with Christianity and her relationship with God in the face of some serious circumstances. This book felt more mature than the previous books in this series. I think it has proved to deepen the character of Gabby St. Claire.
