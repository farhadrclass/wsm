It's been a long time since a book has made me as angry as this one did. I don't think I'm the overly critical sort. I have expectations, and I want them to be met, but I think that I'm willing to compromise. If a book isn't the best written but has a good story, or if the writing is gorgeous, but the story is kinda \"meh\", I can appreciate the book for what it is and move on. But this was just painfully, ridiculously bad. This book's gimmick is that it's the daily journal entries of a person who is trying to survive the zombie apocalypse. That's it. The journal format is what's supposed to make this book different from all the other zombie lit out there. The book kinda hinges on that aspect, so it's important to do it right. And right there, that hinge-y part, is where the author failed to tighten the screws, and the whole thing fell apart almost as soon as I opened it up.Here's why: Writing in the style of journal entries is not the same as 1st person narration. They aren't interchangeable. Similar, sure, but again, NOT the same thing. I feel like I need to make this clear: Journal style \u2260 First person. A journal is where we write our own thoughts, for ourselves, so we don't need to explain things to ourselves that we already know. Writing in journal form is tricky, because the reader DOESN'T know what the journal writer does, so info needs to be conveyed in a subtle, indirect way by context. Not like these:1. \"My friend in Groton, CT called today. Bryce is a Navy submarine officer. He really helped me out on a great deal on salvage parts off the old diesel boats when I was installing those panels in my house a few years back.\" (Pg. 5)Who is he telling? Doesn't he know who Bryce is? Obviously he remembers the help that good ol' Bryce gave him, so why explain it to himself in his own journal? And WHAT panels? If we're all gung-ho about explaining everything to ourselves, let's explain what the hell the panels are. I seem to have forgotten...2. \"I miss my sisters, Jenny and Mandy. [...] I called my dad's house and spoke to Jenny, the youngest.\" (Pg. 7)Again, doesn't he know who Jenny is? Or that she's the youngest? Why is he telling himself this? 3. \"I installed the bars using a tape measure, pencil, 5/32 drill bit, and a square head screwdriver (proprietary screwdriver that came with the bars and it's supposed to be difficult to get the screws out without using a drill.)\" (Pg. 10)I would like to point out here that this is the beginning of the fucking inane shit that seems to take over this book. The ONLY reason I can think of to list out the tools used for installation of anything is so that it can be taken back apart later. But this would only really apply to those tools needed later. Why would anyone (including Sir Journalist) need to know that a tape measure and a pencil were used specifically? No really, I want to know. This is not a rhetorical question. Well, yes it is, because nobody needs to ever know that. It's fucking pointless drivel inserted for \"authenticity\" that needs none. You installed security bars. Bam. Done. I don't need to know if they are black or silver, who manufactured them or what the weather was like as they were being installed unless that has some actual bearing on the story. FFS!!4. \"I finally got through to my Mother and Stepfather (Dad). Mom was hysterical. I had to talk to dad to get any words in. He told me that things were fine and that they were as safe as possible. They hadn't seen any signs of the disease, but told me that there were reports in town of possible outbreak (10 miles away).\" (Pg. 16)Really. REALLY?! Again, WHO IS HE RELAYING THIS TO?? Look, here's how you do this: \"I finally got through to mom. She was hysterical and I had to talk to my stepdad in order to get any words in edgewise. Thank God they are safe - dad said the nearest reports of outbreak are at least 10 miles away from them.\"At this point, I lost patience and flipped ahead to a random page to see if it got any better, where I read this:5. \"I slammed the garage door type shutter down and immediately thought of a way to secure it. I held the shutter down with the bottom of my boot just as the first creature started beating on the metal. They would attract more. The plastic zip ties in my pocket would do no good, as I had nothing on the ground to secure the door to. I glanced over to the corner of the room where I found a mop and some nylon string. Walking over to the corner, I kept my right foot along the lip of the door, and my left for balance. Grabbing the mop, I wedged it between the rollers that made the door slide up smoothly. Using the twine I secured it in place. There was a heavy box on the shelf full of plastic bottles of mouthwash. I sat the box on the lip of the door where my foot was. This wouldn't work forever, but it would have to work for now.\" (Pg. 126-127)So, not only has the writing not improved 110 pages later, but there's even more of it now! The guy is fighting for his life against an undead horde... Exactly when does he have time to take notes on his daily activities? When does he find the time to put them in essay form? Just for fun, let's re-write this one too... \"I slammed the garage door just before the first creature started beating on it and started looking for a way keep it shut. I looked around the room and found a mop and some nylon string. Keeping a foot on the door to hold it closed, I edged over to the mop, jammed it into the door rollers, and tied the string around it to keep it in place. I weighted the door down with a heavy box for good measure. Probably won't last, but better than nothing.\" The sentences I quoted are just plain awkward, and would be in ANY piece of writing, in my humble opinion. I get that it's hard to write fiction in journal entries. There's a lot of info that only the person writing the journal would know, like who Bryce is, or Jenny, or that the stepfather isn't the same \"Dad\" as \"Dad\", and somehow that information needs to be conveyed realistically to the reader. But that's the challenge you take on when you go for that style. It's NOT the same as epistolary fiction using letters or other correspondence, because those are intended to be read by someone else, and therefore the explanation works, is even necessary. The fact is that if Bourne had specified that the journal was being kept for posterity, much of my issues would not even exist. If you're purposefully writing a journal for someone else to read at some point, it makes sense to write it with explanations for them. But unless the purpose of the journal changes at some point, that's not the case. (And honestly, even if it DID, it doesn't explain the explanations in the part that came before the decision to explain to future readers.)What it boils down to is that this book was a huge disappointment, and I couldn't even make it 10% into it. You can be the \"[...]king of hardcore zombie action\" as the quote by Brad Thor says on the cover, but if you can't write a decent sentence, it doesn't matter at all. 1 Decapitation."}, {"userName": "Buggy", "userReviewDate": "Aug 08, 2010", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/3099666-buggy", "userReview": "Opening Line: \"January 1st 0358 hrs. Happy New Year to me\"Wow, this was a surprise! Before I begin I should tell you that I\u2019ve never read a Zombie book in my life and I\u2019m not a fan of the genre (although I did think Shawn Of The Dead was hilarious.) I generally read romance novels with the occasional biography thrown in. So you can imagine my surprise when I became absolutely engrossed in a book about surviving a plague of walking dead. Day By Day Armageddon was unputdownable and had me alternating between being really freaked out,(checking doors and windows) despairing for the future of mankind (also afraid of the dark) and getting my personal survival kit (weapons, food, Band-Aids, Gin) ready for \u201cthat day\u201d -Could I really kill my undead friends and neighbours? Simply put this is more then just a zombie novel and this romance reader loved every minute of it. DBDA has been written from the first person and in the form of a journal which for me increased the suspense factor. Because our unnamed hero sometimes starts out an entry with things like \u201c0430 hrs- I\u2019m still weak from blood loss\u201d before going back and explaining. As the reader you\u2019re like, holy shit what happened last night? The narrator is a US Navel officer who begins his journal as a New Years resolution. It all starts out rather mundanely with day to day life stuff and a few ominous mentions like this one \"It seems that something is going on in China; the local news reported some type of influenza virus sweeping them over there.\u201d The flu is of course the Zombie virus and it spreads to apocalyptic proportions within months. I found these parts really interesting; how the author saw the realistic(?) breakdown of society, media blackouts and the extents the US government ultimately took to eradicate the disease. In the early entries our hero spends a great deal of time describing (in a very calm manner) how he safe guards his home; locating and stockpiling weapons and ammunition, collecting food and water and having an alternate power/communication plan in action. He\u2019s a super smart guy and although the military jargon and descriptions of guns got to be a bit much I\u2019d definitely want him on my side. With swarms of undead now parading through the streets our barricaded hero eventually teams up with his neighbour John and with no options left the pair flees the city, picking up other survivors along the way and dealing with a multitude of post apocalyptic problems. The futility of it all really got to me here as they struggle to stay alive under ridiculous odds. I had a hard time seeing a point to it all. (Good bet I wouldn\u2019t survive)This book is full of action and also a ton of well written suspense although it wasn\u2019t as gory as I was I expecting. Don\u2019t get me wrong though, it has its moments but its not gore for gores sake, all the kills are warranted. (Can\u2019t believe I just said that) As silly as this sounds this book really made me think; what would I do? How could I prepare myself? Could I survive? I should also warn you that this is addictive reading and that the ending is well\u2026 more than a cliff-hanger. Just make sure you have book 2 Beyond Exile: Day by Day Armageddon on hand because the war on Zombies isn\u2019t over yet. Highly Recommended for lovers of apocalyptic fiction, Zombie fiction, horror, adventure, disaster stories, military buffs, survivalist fiction and the occasional romance reader.

An unknown plague sweeps the planet. The dead rise to claim the Earth as the new dominant species. Trapped in the midst of a global tragedy, he must make decisions...choices that that ultimately mean life, or the eternal curse to walk as one of them. My Review: I really, really wish the narrative frame of \u201cjournal\u201d was gone. This novel is just fine without that explanation, in fact a good deal better without it, because no one on the surface of the earth describes their little sister as their little sister in a journal. (Among other details that don't fit in the journal frame.)A book to be enjoyed without one's awf'ly awwwgust self-imposed \u201cthis is not good enough because it is not good enough\u201d filters on; note to snobbish readers: Yes, I rated it higher than Gone Girl and all works of, oh say Dickens, because reading it was a great deal more pleasant than reading those books.IN. MY. OPINION. Now. Perfect it isn't, and as annoying as the self-published novel with all the usual faults (wrong words used, punctuation eccentricities) can be, this one's got something going for it: Energy. This story's getting told by someone who really really likes the storytelling. I found that infectious (pardon pun) because, AGAIN IN MY OPINION (and how tired I am of having to defend my utterances by stating something that the absurdly over-sensitive or over-critical need to get a damn grip and assume is the case in a review), it takes this zombie novel out of the cash-in herd where Colson Whitehead et alii live. Bourne loves this story and can't not tell it, and that came through to me loud and clear.Would I recommend it? No, not really, because zombie novels aren't in need of recommendations to the fan base, and the non-fans don't need to bother themselves with the genre. In my ongoing quest not to turn back into a dismissive, annoying book-snob, I read this because Stephen-from-Ohio (a zombie-book aficionado) gave it a good review. It's not a genre I'm going to adopt as regular diet, but there are some good stories being told in it. This being my fourth zombie novel, though, I don't want to go any deeper into the swamp. Go out on the highest note yet, I say, scraping zombie off my shoe."}, {"userName": "Brett Van Valkenburg", "userReviewDate": "Jan 08, 2010", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/1042949-brett-van-valkenburg", "userReview": "I guess I can only explain the majority of Amazon users' glowing appraisals with the fact that Bourne has some interesting ideas. It's like he thought of the most interesting places someone could hole-up during a zombie apocalypse and then wrote a book around them. That combined with the fleeting bits of action throughout the story encouraged me to continue reading despite my overwhelming objections to much of the rest of the book.Some users have tried to explain the main character's overreaction, and thereby preparedness, for a zombie fallout with the fact that he is a military man and therefore preparation is in his nature, but I just don't buy it. There's a viral outbreak in China and this guy starts putting bars on his windows in case Texans begin looting? Come on. I could maybe see stocking up on food and bottled water, but not on ammo and materials for fortification. And on the flip side, let's say I did agree with the explanation and I that thought his reaction was appropriate for a disciplined member of the military. But let me ask this: If this guy is such a stoic military purist, then why would he ignore his commanding officer's orders to join his squad on base? It wasn't because he looked out and saw an unassailable horde of zombies outside his conveniently pre-constructed high rock wall. It was because he simply thought he'd be better off in his home than on a MILITARY BASE. This doesn't sound like the conditioned thinking of a man who has spent the majority of his adult life serving the military.The lack of and/or unexplainable character development is another one of my gripes. Each character seems to be in the story to serve the utility of the moment and that's it: There's the military tactician/pilot, the mechanical engineer, the medical nurse, the chemist (I'm sure he'll come in handy in the next book), the love interest, and the zombie-sensing dog--a varied and useful combination of people/dog indeed. They're all very emotionless and hard to sympathize with, i.e. I was hoping they'd get eaten.I also can't stand how the main character regards the zombies. He often refers to them in bombastic terms like `demonic creatures', `putrid devils', `pure evil', etc.... Wrong. They're zombies, which means they're not after humans because they're cruel or because they enjoy maiming people. They're after them because of a singular primordial instinct in the back of their decomposing brains to feed. I might have even forgiven his ill-tempered attitude towards them if something happened to make him a voracious zombist (I just coined that), like he knew for a fact that they killed his parents or his friend was killed right in front of him or something, but nothing even happens to the character to birth such unfounded animosity towards them. Not to mention that toward the end he describes a couple of bound zombies as being `poor creatures' or something to that effect. Well, which is it? You irrationally hate them or you realize that it's not their fault for being undead? Get consistent as well as logical.My last complaint is the poor writing and editing. The journal-style is an unnecessary and detracting novelty, and Bourne's writing style is so magniloquent and yet so often bad that at times it becomes hard to stomach. I think he has potential though, especially if he takes his criticism seriously. The editing is also terrible with many glaring mistakes, and I feel that if there was a good editor at the helm, many of Bourne's problems could have been cleaned up before the book even went to print."}, {"userName": "Stephen", "userReviewDate": "Jan 20, 2010", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/1413439-stephen", "userReview": "3.5 stars.

I am a die hard zombie-phile and love all the different takes on the genre. This story done by J.L.Bourne takes the zombie story and gives it to us at the point of view of a modern day soldier who's name we never get to know. The name, Day by Day Armageddon, is perfect as this is a journal type story that is told by a soldier. It is a daily written account telling our heroes trials and tribulations from the first day of the end of the world.The journal style gave this book an interesting feel and a bit of reality to it. The pacing is fast, and there is a great deal of action and zombie killing. Not much original in the backstory or in the zombies themselves. (there are fast zombies and normal slow shufflers)The good and the bad about this book are both the same thing. Our hero is a soldier, and this book is told from his point of view. Cold, calculated, planned, and executed. Our hero is in his prime which makes him almost robotic in nature. He even makes several journal entries that comments on his disciplined nature, and his robotic state. His background and his story makes this book original and fresh. Unfortunately, he is cold, without emotion or feelings, and therefore so too is this story. We never feel any emotional investment in him or his companions. If not for the adorable Italian Greyhoud named Annabelle, I would not have had any character to care about.There is not much backstory, nor is there much world building as they are portraying our world today. I enjoyed this book and overall feel that the fresh aspect of the book outweighed that of the lack of feelings. I will read the next and I am sure that fans of the genre will find things to like about this book."}, {"userName": "seak", "userReviewDate": "Jul 25, 2015", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/1805180-seak", "userReview": "Take The Martian, add zombies and subtract the humor and you get Day by Day Armageddon. So ... I guess that means it's just like journal-style narrative, which is what this is. Each day in the journal of the life of an unnamed protagonist.I was in the mood for a good zombie book and Day by Day scratched that itch. It's nothing that really breaks any mold. They're still a hoard of zombies that suddenly sneak up on you even though they're loud, moaning creatures. The survivors are the ones to worry about.As typical for zombie books, the plot is the focus and characters, especially with the journal-style, are less important. It's definitely a weakness, but it's hard to get out of that with the style of the book. The main protagonist is a military-type, so it was a slight change of your typical everyman who's dealing with the world crumbling down around him.Of course, the protagonist goes from one problem to the next. That's the beauty of a zombie apocalypse, it's all believable and nothing contrived when there are monsters everywhere. He runs into other people with similar issues ... okay, the exact same. Everyone's screwed.There are odd typos, but after doing some research I guess they're intentional to add realism. Note to self, typos are the last way to add realism to anything. Just write grammatically correct or it takes me out of the story. That's less real when I'm out of the story.Another benefit is this book is relatively short. It's an easy, short, plot-driven zombie book. Nothing more, nothing less. I'm looking forward to reading more in the series.4 out of 5 stars (highly recommended)"}, {"userName": "EdsEds", "userReviewDate": "Feb 09, 2012", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/4073821-edseds", "userReview": "I am a great fan of zombie fiction and post-apocalyptic fiction in general. I absolutely loved Max Brook's World War Z so I was really excited to pick up this book. The journalistic style intrigued me and I had hoped to get a realistic, first person view of a survivor in a world ruled by the undead.How easy would it be to survive in a world full of flesh eating zombies? Really easy - especially considering that the protagonist is apparently McGyver! Our hero can fly a plane, hotwire a car, is a dead shot and can fashion a weapon out of anything. And he is extremely, ridiculously well-prepared. He already has solar panels installed from a long time ago and has rechargable submarine batteries lying around his house for some reason. A wardrobe full of (fireproof and maybe biteproof?) full body nomex flight suits is also a nice touch, among other things. Even before there were hints of the undead epidemic, he goes to great lengths to fortify his house because he is worried about potential looters. Yes, looters.Finding weapons and food in this post-apocalyptic world also seems to be almost effortless - when the protagonist and his companions travel around zombie-infested Texas, they frequently stumble onto things like guns and ammo and night vision goggles. It puts me to mind of a first person shooter video game where these things are just lying around waiting to be taken.There is no real sense of danger at all - not from zombies and other human survivors. The main character escapes scrapes all too easily and seems to be equipped with all the skills and tools necessary to survive in a world filled with the living dead - in short, he is just too perfect. Even the people he meets along the way have conveniently useful skills. The people he ends up rescuing are not web designers or middle managers - oh no - he meets a mechanical engineer, a chemist and a nurse. There is one woman with no obvious 'useful' skills but the hero does mention that she is very attractive OK, the attractive one - check. And lets not forget the cute dog that alerts them to the presence of the undead. And the icing on the cake - they are all good-natured, well-adjusted and helpful people. Not a nutter or even slightly obnoxious one among them.The biggest problem in this book are the 2-dimensional characters. You would think that the first person style viewpoint would flesh out the main character better, but no, he is so bland and colourless, so much that when he drops the occasional F-bomb, it is very jarring - almost like the author is trying to artificially inject some 'character' into him. Our hero would occasionally bring up the fact that he is scared and fearful - but somehow this doesn't ring true at all. As they say - show, don't tell.At the end of the day, I felt more sympathy for the zombies. It's not completely without its merits which is why I gave it 2 starts instead of 1- I found it entertaining enough to pass a rainy afternoon.

In particular, the error that kept popping up was this:Zombies should be wandering around. In this book, the zombies wondered around. It's a spelling error that changes the meaning of the word. Every time the author meant to use the word wander, he used wonder instead. This is not the fault of J.L. Bourne. I do not expect authors to be good spellers. The responsibility of the author is to craft a good story. Bourne does this just fine. My beef is with Bourne's editor. The responsibility of the editor is to CATCH THE SPELLING ERRORS!This was not the only editing error, but it was certainly the most distracting. Any error in any book causes me to stop reading, lose the flow of the story, and fixate on the fact that an error exists in a professionally edited book. Most books have zero errors. Some books have one tiny one (like a misplaced apostrophe). Any more than the one tiny one and I start to get irrationally frustrated with a book.

I have my reasons why i think this book is amazing. (1.) It has zombies, how is that not cool?(unless you don't like zombie) (2.) It is done in a diary format, in military time, in first person perspective. (3.) and finally this book is probably the most intense and scary book I have read for a long time, but don't take my word for it here is an example from \u201cDay by Day Armageddon\u201d \t\u201cI shut the door again. My instincts told me, @* the plane cover; it's not that important. For some reason, I ignored that. I took out my LED light and tightened it on the light mount of my rifle, I switched the light on and opened the door again. Put the muzzle of my weapon in so that I could light up the dark garage. The smell was almost unbearable.\tThe source of the noise became immediately apparent. A dead mechanic, crushed by a hydraulic lift was lying there on his back, re-animated, and banging a torque wrench on the ground. A low grunt came from his badly mutilated body as he tried to look up at me. He was reaching for me. It was then, in the span of a second, that the following happened:\tI saw the bite marks of the flesh that had been torn away from his face and neck. I knew that he didn't do it himself, and deduced that there was another dead @* in the room. Last, but not least, the door flew open and I was tackled by one of them (Best guess, the same one that had the mechanic for lunch).\tThe only thing that was keeping this stick ridden $#!& ball from biting my nose off was the fact that I had my weapon wedged between us. I pushed it off, and it (couldn't tell male of female) grabbed my wrist. I gave it a nice rifle but to the head and it fell back. I immediately got to my feet and popped a round in it's head. I wanted to @#^&ing mow it in half, but the reasonable half of me said, don't waste ammunition. \tThe door to the garage was shut, it and was going to %&*#ing stay that way. I could hear the sound of fists on the door, and I knew that there were more inside. I went back on the side of the garage where I saw some oil drums and rolled one of them back around to the front, to put it in the doorway and prevent whatever was behind that door from opening it and ruining my day.\u201d\tSo intense huh? Now there are a few reasons that I decided to read this book. One it has fecking zombies, how are zombies not cool, especially when there are lots of them. Two it involves the military. Third and finally it is done in a diary format, books like that only heighten the mood. If I could recommend this to anyone, it would probably be people who are into fantasy and/or horror. This was not a difficult book to read, the large print helped.

It's not something I care to admit in public. \"Oh, yes, I'm reading Kafka this month\", not, \"hey, I'm reading this cool book about the undead.\" But zombies are merely a metaphor for the ultimate enemy: one you can kill with abandon; one that never gives up; one that revolts the human soul. So a well written novel about the psychological stresses involved in the ultimate war attracts me.This book, like WWZ, is the manual for the apocalypse. Read it and prep. The MC is a navy pilot, ready and willing to make the choices that need to made for his own survival. Initially attempting to hole up at his well readied house, he discovers the government plans to nuke the major cities. I'll update when done, which won't be long, as I'm inhaling this rather than reading it.Finished. Excellent. It did end on a cliff hanger, unfortunately, so now I'll have to get the next. This probably isn't for those who like descriptive, thoughtful stories. There are five characters in the novel and not one of them is given any description at all; not their height, hair colour...anything. Which is realistic for a military guy recording things in his journal but frustrating if you want a more novel-like format. I'm off to find book 2."}, {"userName": "Dawn Peers", "userReviewDate": "Mar 20, 2013", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/1967886-dawn-peers", "userReview": "I am a huge fan of post-apocalyptic fiction, especially zombie novels.I came to JL Bourne's books only a few months ago, but within a few pages of this his writing style had me hooked.The story initially comes from the perspective of one military man immediately before, during, and after the viral outbreak that brings around the inevitable zombie apocalypse. The pragmatism of the main character brings to mind the way Max Brook's characters operated in World War Z, but he is realistic, fallible, and likeable. As a range of characters are introduced, there is a (gratefully) noticeable lack of genre stereotypes, which makes this novel feel fresh against some of the alternatives available (such as Plague of the Dead: The Morningstar Strain which is a good novel, but has a lack of originality).The story moves at a great pace, and keeps you wanting to turn the page - the details where the writer has obvious knowledge (such as military actions and equipment) are thorough, but not overbearingly so.I'd bought the sequel, Beyond Exile: Day By Day Armageddon, before I even finished this, and devoured that when it arrived too."}, {"userName": "Angelica Juarez Gonzalez", "userReviewDate": "Jun 02, 2017", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/25338232-angelica-juarez-gonzalez", "userReview": "[si hasta el gobierno lanzo esas bombas nucleares sin importar que hubiesen humanos que muy probablemente murieron.

When I said hardcore zombie fan, I'm talking about daydreaming for hours on end about end of the world survival scenarios, reading up on every piece of zombie literature you could get your hands on, devouring every single zombie movie ever made and stockpile on food and ammunition to prepare for an event that will most likely never, ever happen. That is the kind of obsession this book will appeal to, because if you're already in love with the subject, you will be able to forgive a lot of glaring flaws Day by Day: Armageddon presents.They say one should write the kind of story one wants to read. Interpret it however you want, but no writer had failed at selling books with this philosophy. If you want to get others to read your story, you need to write your story the way you would want to read it even if someone else wrote it. That story would concern twists, characters, plots, intrigues, things that would draw both you and the readers in, and this is the story you need to craft. At least that's not I interpret it. The author, whether intentional or not, didn't just write a book he wants to read, he wrote one he wanted to live in, to be a hero in. This approach had proved profitable for him, as it did when Stephenie Meyer wrote down her wet dream and E L James penned her masturbation fantasy; they wrote the story they wanted to be in. This kind of wish fulfillment, when it worked, it would work really well, but when it fails, as it did for me in this case, it became a drawling, ponderous retard with little plot and too much of the author trying to live out his daydreams. But with that said, I had once been a zombie fan, which was why I picked up this book, and that is where I could not overcome the flaws. It was horribly written. Explaining this would be me trying to overstep myself as the author is a published novelist, and I have zero credential, but I'll let this quote show you: The last wounded ghoul got back on its feet and raised its arms like a deranged Frankenstein as it came at me.I mean, c'mon man!!The writing takes away most of the tension, and without that, a zombie novel is pointless. As most of the novel is filled with the author's wish fulfillment, there isn't much in the plot department either. Things happened here and there, but it isn't something you haven't seen before. I honestly was very disappointed with this novel, even as a ex-zombie-fan. If you want to read some really good zombie, post-apocalyptic novels, find Craig Dilouie's Tooth and Nail, The Infection, D.

Many post-apocalyptic book deal with the threat of people, but this one really was more about one man vs the zombie horde. Later on a few other characters are picked up; but they're given a very brief surface treatment, we never really get to know them in depth, as the story is told through a very narrow view. The writing is extremely simple, and I can't quite tell whether this is because the author isn't a good writer, or if it's the opposite, the author is a great writer who is trying to make it feel like authentic diary entries from a fairly simple-minded soldier. Either way, it ends up working, as it really places you day to day in the viscera of the action and events. I thought it was a decent, fast paced action novel with some interesting detail in the way of information about weapons and military details. An easy, fast read that kept me on the edge of my seat, despite the fairly shallow character development, because the way the diary is written always keeps you in the very heat of the moment. I will give this one a four stars, although realistically it's probably closer to a 3.5, and I don't think I'll be checking out the next in the series right now, but should I need another dose of zombie action, I'd definitely consider coming back to it."}, {"userName": "Stefania", "userReviewDate": "Oct 22, 2017", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/6468477-stefania", "userReview": "[ci sono 100 persone rimaste vive in tutto e me le fai pure lottare una contro l'altra??ma dai (hide spoiler)]"}, {"userName": "Christina White", "userReviewDate": "Oct 29, 2012", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/4349493-christina-white", "userReview": "I had no idea that a zombie apocalypse could be so boring!

No one writes in a diary like that. There was a lot of detail put into describing flight procedures, guns, ammo, and boat engines that included lots of numbers and acronyms that meant nothing to me. Parts of the story were so dry it was like reading a directions manual. Bourne needed to spend more time developing his characters so the reader could be invested in their survival and the plot could have kept us interested.

The title, DAY BY DAY ARMAGEDDON suggests that this is a book about either an apocalypse or, an infestation of the undead which is what the cover suggests. It is a 200 page long zombie fiction, and a well written book. It is written in the form of a journal and in the view of the main character.Though the author never mentions the main characters name, he tells us a lot about him. Such as, he an unmarried air force pilot who lives in a semi-small house about 18 miles away from San Antonio. He is a modest man who doesn\u2019t have very many close friends before most of the world\u2019s population is turned into flesh eating undead. Other survivors see him as a good honest man who, several times goes out of his way and risk\u2019s his own life to save other survivors. They also respect him and view him as an authoritative figure. The most important secondary character is John. He is with the main character for almost the entire duration of his fight for survival and is always helpful to other characters. Though he is troubled by the death of his wife and son, and the caring of his dog Annabelle, he still manages to do his best to keep other peoples spirits up. The other four characters, who are later recued by this rag tag duo, are (in order of their appearance) William, who is a chemist and the husband of Jan (short for Janet) who was a nurse before the outbreak. Their daughter, Laura who we are not told much about, only that she is under ten years old. And finally Tara, a 20 year old woman that they find trapped in a car in the parking lot of an old shopping mall. For quite some time after her rescue she is unable to speak or eat.The main plot goes like this; Reports of strange attacks halfway around the globe, all American troops pulling out of other countries, foreign duty assignments cancelled without reason. Total outbreak. The disease hits home soil and the proverbial shit hits the fan. After it is announced that the president has died, the newly appointed president authorizes the use of tactical nukes on all major cities in the U.S. When they get this warning the main character say\u2019s \u201cThen the anchorwoman spilt the proverbial beans\u201d. They decide they need to bug out, so they find an aircraft and fly aimlessly until they come upon an old beach resort.Here they find an old ham radio. Soon after establishing a base they receive desperate cries for help. It is at this point they find William and his family. Upon returning to their little slice of heaven/hell they discover Tara locked in a car surrounded by the undead. A short while later they have her on a boat and they decide to head further up the coast until they run out of fuel. When they reach land they start heading inland. After several days of travel they stumble upon one of the 8 original minutemen launch and storage sites named, hotel 23. I don\u2019t believe that the author wrote this book with any particular message.

I primi due volumi sono reperibili, il terzo alla data in cui scrivo, non \u00e8 ancora uscito.J. L. Bourne, militare di professione, ha partecipato ad alcune delle ultime operazioni militari americane, tra cui quella in Iraq. Non \u00e8 uno scrittore di professione dunque, ed effitavamente nel libro si percepisce in pi\u00f9 punti. la curiosit\u00e0 di questo libro \u00e8 che \u00e8 scritta come un diario e le cronache narrate, in un primo momento, sono nate sotto forma di post sul blog dell'autore e visto l'ampia riscossione di successo sono state acquistate e pubblicate in cartaceo, venendo acclamate dalla critica e dal pubblico in maniera pi\u00f9 che positiva.La trama non fa gridare al miracolo dell'originalit\u00e0, ma in tutta franchezza \u00e8 difficile inventare qualcosa di nuovo nel campo della letteratura zombesca: \u00e8 la battaglia di un uomo per la sopravvivenza, contro le prove che il mondo dei non morti gli propone giornalmente\u2026 Una piaga sconosciuta dilaga sul pianeta. I morti risorgono e, come nuova specie dominante, reclamano la Terra. Imprigionato in una tragedia planetaria, toccano a lui decisioni fondamentali \u2013 scelte che faranno la definitiva e assoluta differenza tra la vita o l\u2019eterna maledizione\u2026Come si diceva nulla di nuovo, ma l\u2019uso della prima persona e la \"trovata\" del diario favorisce il coinvolgimento del lettore nel mondo e nelle vicende vissute dal protagonista, vivendo cos\u00ec attraverso i suoi scritti l'orrore, la paura e la discesa verso un mondo impazzito, dove torner\u00e0 preponderante la legge del pi\u00f9 forte, o del meglio armato.Tutto il libro non ha veri e propri capitoli, se non sommarie sezioni; il tutto sembra scritto come appunti che un qualsiasi sopravvissuto potrebbe scrivere, veloci e diretti, e quasi non esiste l'idea del romanzo in quanto tale. E se questo agevola il ritmo e la velocit\u00e0 di lettura, ne pecca la scrittura e la costruzione dei personaggi, se non di quello principale, ma sicuramente dei comprimari.Dunque in questo primo libro di Bourne c\u2019\u00e8 la componente pi\u00f9 superficiale dell'arte dello scrivere e raccontare storie, ma non per questo banale o poco efficace nel raccontarne le vicende, la lotta ai morti che camminano, il mondo descritto ed il linguaggio che viene usato rispecchia quella che potrebbe essere la realt\u00e0 immaginata. Il libro tutto sommato mi ha divertito e sicuramente legger\u00f2 anche gli altri due della serie, sperando in una maggiore capacit\u00e0 narrativa dell'autore nei seguenti episodi.http://kelanthsblog.blogspot.it/"}, {"userName": "Patrick D'Orazio", "userReviewDate": "Nov 05, 2010", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/4328815-patrick-d-orazio", "userReview": "This book was fun to read. Moreso than many of the other zombie books I have read recently as I have gotten more and more into this genre. Don't get me wrong, I have enjoyed most of the stories I have read, but this one just hit me the right way I guess. I like the narative approach. It is certainly not something I want with all my books-a \"Dear Diary\" route, but it works quite well here. It gives the author a lot of latitude with how the story flows and even the grammar, etc. After all, this is a story that is being told by someone in a very high pressure and terrifying situation. I wouldn't expect him to be a master literary artist in telling his tale. Using this device is perhaps limiting in that you get no other perspective, no real sense of some of the other characters and what they are going through outside of the eyes of the correspondent, but we all live our lives seeing things exlusively through our own eyes. We can attempt to \"empathize\" with others but in the end, it is all shaded by our own experiences and biases. So we see what this character sees and only that, shaded by his experiences and biases alone. It is one persons view and one person's reality. It keeps it clean and concise, which I felt worked really well for this story. I guess I also like the fact that the book is so personal and is not overly grand in scale. Just a guy who hooks up with some other folks trying to survive and is doing the best he can. It seems to be comparable to Walking Dead series in that regard. Given that there is to be a sequel, I am looking forward to it as much as I am Volume 5 of the other series. I like the common sense of this character. So many stories about zombies center around the arrogance of mankind; how foolish we are. We watch a tale unfold and we end up siding with the zombies because so many of the characters in a movie or book are just plain dumb, clueless, or show how evil they really are. The stories usually can claim that we deserve a grizzly fate due to our failings and our general lack of concern for the terrible things we do as a society and as a race. I am not opposed to morality tales, in fact I think that zombies serve that purpose tremendously well. Romero has done a wonderful job of making each of his movies a very inciteful social commentary on our culture and what he believes is wrong with it. But sometimes, you just like to see the humans actually behave with a bit of sense and succeed in avoiding becoming lunch meat for the undead. Go humans!!!

I enjoyed this book and burned through it pretty quickly, but noticed quite a few spelling, grammar and fact-checking errors that I think have prevented the novel from achieving more success. Spelling and grammar mistakes are pretty unforgivable - the editor needs to be fired. Certain occurrences in the story bothered me as well:- The guy routinely uses a knife to open canned food. Has the author ever tried to do that? It's not remotely easy. Why not just use a can opener?- None of the characters carry hand weapons despite the fact that the zombies are primarily attracted to sound, and any gunshots immediately bring in dozens of brain-munchers. Why not carry a bat or crowbar to quietly dispatch the occasional zombie they encounter? Instead, they always shoot and then run like mad.- In a few cases, he kills a zombie by shoving a knife through its eye socket. Again, not nearly as easy, efficient, or safe as he makes it sound.- Buzzards perch on a zombie's shoulders and peck at it while the zombie ineffectually gnashes it's teeth at them. Carrion birds are way too skittish to ever mess with something that's trying to bite them.Maybe I'm being a little too critical of a book about zombies. It's not exactly nested in reality to begin with, but the little details bugged me.

It wasn't anything special and merely mediocre. It wasn't completely bad either, just pretty forgettable. I did like the idea of a journal style telling of a zombie apocalypse.

I didn't really mind that too much, I just thought it was a bit of a missed opportunity.What bothered me more were the unbelievably detailed descriptions. Usually you'd think a lot of descriptions would make a book more authentic. Not in this case. Sometimes it felt like reading an instruction manual with just as much emotion. You wouldn't really think this guy was fighting for his life, worrying about his family and the future. Everything just felt very clinical and emotionless to me. Speaking of which, I feel like I don't know the protagonist at all. He doesn't really seem to have a lot of personality.There were some good parts were I actually experienced a little suspense. But it was way too less. I bought this as an audiobook and as such it did entertain me enough while doing my housework and stuff. But I don't think I'm gonna buy the next two books.
