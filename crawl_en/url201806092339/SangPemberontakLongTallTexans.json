He nodded.His eyes were haunted. \"I loved her. I thought she loved me.\" He laughed coldly. \"She certainly loved what I could buy her.\"\"I gave up women years ago.\"\"She told me that she'd gone to a clinic while I was away. She'd seen a lawyer, too. Just before she walked out the door, she told me that she wasn't bringing the child of a cold-blooded killer into the world.\"\nWe're both damaged people. That being the case, it would be insane of us to get involved with one another. So that's not going to happen.\"\nIt had been a long dry spell, but even so, his reaction to Tippy was unsettling.\n\"I do not want to get married again,\" he said flatly. \"Period.\"\n\"I know how to hate. I had the living hell beaten out of me, so that I was in such pain that I couldn't even fight back. I was bruised and bleeding, and afterward I was raped over and over again, screaming for help that never came, while my own mother...\" \n\"Except for Garon, my oldest brother, I haven't seen my other brothers or my father in years,\" he replied. \"My father and I don't speak.\"\n\"He had his mistress at the funeral, at my mother's funeral,\" he said coldly. \"She hated me, and I hated her. She'd conned two of my three brothers, and they were crazy about her and furious with me because I wouldn't let her near me. I saw right through her. I knew she was only after Dad's property and his wealth. So to get even, she threw out all my mother's things and told my father that I'd called her terrible names and that I'd make my father get rid of her.\"\n\"You're trapped in your own past. You can't get out, because you can't let go of the pain and the hatred and the bitterness.\"\n...he was feeling sensations he'd never experienced in his life, and getting a vicious case of cold feet.\nIt had been a long time. Too long. He was ripe for a reckless night in bed.\n'There's something you have to know, before this starts. I don't have anything to use.\" Her eyes sought his. \"I don't care.\"\nThat's it. Just relax. I'm driving. You're riding. Okay?\"\n\"Making love is like singing the blues. The slower it is, the better it is.\"\n\"I want a child,\" he whispered helplessly as his body moved into total possession. \"Oh, God, Tippy...I want a...child!\"\"We were both irresponsible,\" he bit off. \"This was stupid. But you started it.\"\nHe glowered at her. \"I am not marrying you!\" he continued angrily.\n\"And this was a one-night stand. Period.\"\nHe didn't understand his own feelings anymore. He'd been crazy about Christabel Gaines. Her innocence, her kindness, her sense of humor, her independence and strength of will had attracted him. But Christabel had never known the sort of life he'd led. She would have been sympathetic to his nightmares and his horrific past, but she'd never have understood them. Tippy would.\n\"I don't trust anyone close enough to share them. Including you,\" he lashed out involuntarily.\nHe kept everyone at arm's length. But he indulged Christabel always. It didn't take a mind reader to know that he'd have sacrificed anything for her, including his own life.\nHe drew in a slow breath. \"Your figure isn't my business,\" he said, as gently as he could. \"I brought you here to protect you...\"\nHe chuckled softly. \"Don't get too comfortable,\" he murmured. \"I'm a happy bachelor.\"\n\"You'd better look for another job,\" Julie Merrill said hatefully. \"Oh, I have a job, Miss Merrill,\" Cash replied pleasantly. \"I have no plans to resign.\" \"We'll see about that!\" she scoffed. Cash smiled at her.\nTippy knew too much about him, and he didn't trust her. He didn't trust anyone.\nStars exploded behind her closed eyelids as she felt him impale her. Her eyes opened wide and looked straight up into his. She gasped at the deep, fierce movement of his hips.\n (hide spoiler)]"}, {"userName": "jenjn79", "userReviewDate": "Mar 25, 2008", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/946249-jenjn79", "userReview": "Rating: 4.5 / 5I'm not sure why I only gave this 3.5 stars the first time around. I've read it twice more since then and I'm seriously tempted to give it five stars. I think maybe my opinion the first time was affected by the fact that I hadn't read Lawless yet, which is the book that precedes this one and the two are very connected. If you just read Renegade you miss a lot of back story and character nuances. So I'm guessing that the first time I read the story, I felt like I was missing something having not read Lawless. But the other two times I had and I loved the book a lot those times.Renegade picks up where Lawless ends and develops the relationship between Jacobsville police chief Cash Grier and model/actress Tippy Moore. The two met in the previous book and Cash took an immediate disliking of her. A model had wrecked his parents marriage and ruined his childhood. But Cash eventually realizes that Tippy is nothing like she seems.So he visits her in New York and learns a lot about why she is the way she is. As much as he is attracted to her, he is afraid of a relationship developing. The people he loves have always let him down. But he can't seem to stay away from her. Tippy feels the same way. She's almost never trusts men, but Cash makes her feels things she's never felt before. Cash lets his fears chase him away and a misunderstanding almost keeps her permanently away. But when Tippy and her young brother are in danger, Cash takes charge and realizes maybe a relationship isn't such a bad thing. Now he just has to convince Tippy to forgive him.Cash is probably my favorite Diana Palmer heroes, and a favorite hero in general. There's just something about him that's really appealing. A stoic outsider with a kind heart and hidden vulnerabilities. I loved the scenes where he was claiming ownership of Judd and Crissy's daughter. Those cracked me up. And yeah, he has some borderline asshole moments in this book, but they were ones that you could understand. He's been hurt badly in the past and doesn't trust easily. So maybe he was a little harsh at times, but I could see where it was coming from. I found Tippy surprisingly likable. After the way she was in the beginning of Lawless, it's hard to imagine that she could be a workable heroine. But Palmer does a great job fleshing out her character and making readers understand why she acted the way she did before. She ends up being a rather admirable heroine. And that thing with the iron skillet...that's just great. I loved that scene. And I like how Palmer has referred to that in later books. Great sense of continuity.Also surprising about this book is that strays a bit from Palmer's usual formula writing. When I read this book, it doesn't make me think of any of her other books. Which is a good thing. I thought the storyline fit well with the characters. It's got a little bit of suspense, lots of emotional drama, and a great romance. I did notice a few inconsistencies in details, but I could mostly ignore them.This is a book I think Palmer fans will enjoy. But I'd definitely recommend reading Lawless first. It really helps in understanding the characters in this book."}, {"userName": "Ren", "userReviewDate": "Dec 15, 2010", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/3666031-ren", "userReview": "Baca Renegade abis baca Lawman, eh kebalik yah harusnya baca ini dulu baru Lawman, tapi karena ada yang ajak baca Lawman dulu ya sudahlah :))Menceritakan tentang Cash Grier, kepala polisi Jacobsville dan Tippy Moore, model ganti haluan jadi artis yang dijuluki \"Kunang-Kunang Georgia\" , yang sudah kita kenal tentunya dari cerita \nCash menyadari bahwa Tippy tak seperti yang terlihat, dia bukanlah model yang suka menggoda laki-laki lain (baca: Judd Dunn, GEBLEK no 2 di novel DP :)) ), Sebaliknya Tipy adalah pribadi yang rapuh dan halus,dan masa lalunya juga sama kelamnya dengan Cash.Cash bertemu dengan Tippy dan adiknya Rory di New York, untuk merayakan Natal. Setelah malam yang penuh gairah antara Cash yang ga bisa nahan diri dan Tippy yang di luar dugaan, bisa dibilang minim pengalaman masalah laki-laki, Cash berusaha menghindari Tippy dan kembali ke Jacobsville. Tippy kembali berakting, dan menyadari bahwa dirinya hamil oleh anak Cash. Kebahagiaanya tak berlangsung lama, karena Tippy keguguran, dan Cash menganggap Tippy sengaja melakukan itu, lebih mementingkan karir, daripada anak, mengingatkan Cash pada mantan istrinya yang terdahulu,Tippy yang tenggelam dalam kesedihan, mabuk2an. Namun, saat itu juga,Rory yang mencemaskan sang kakak, dan berusaha menghubungi Cash, malah diculik!. Tippy meminta bantuan Cash, tapi Cash tak menghiraukannya. Akhirnya Tippy berinisiatif untuk menukar dirinya dengan Rory sebagai sandera. Cash menyadari kesalahannya dan berusaha menyelamatkan Tippy yang dihajar habis2an oleh sang penjahat.Sekarang setelah Tippy selamat, Cash harus menghadapi perasaannya terhadap Tippy dan juga menghadapi masa lalunya. Cash sadar, dengan bantuan Tippy, mungkin akhirnya dia bisa lepas dari bayang2 masa lalu...Renegade, pastinya lebih bagus daripada Lawman, walau tak bikin gregetan seperti Lawless.Cash Grier juga tak terlalu menyebalkan, tapi yang mengejutkan adalah kepribadian Tippy yang berubah 180 derajat, dari seorang cewe seductress di Lawless, menjadi wanita yang rapuh, tapi juga penuh pengertian, pemberani dan membantu Cash mengatasi masa lalunya.Penduduk Jacobsville sangat adorable, dan aku tak sabar untk membaca kisah2 penduduk Jacobsville lainnya.Dan keluhanku masih sama, buku ini tipis, tapi harganya MUAHAAAALLLL!!! >:("}, {"userName": "Dawn \u2665 romance", "userReviewDate": "Feb 24, 2017", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/4120638-dawn-romance", "userReview": "This story had its exciting parts but I really disliked the hero.

Tippy is not your typical DP heroine. She is a Hollywood starlet, bitter, cynical and almost an alcoholic. Cash is a kind, honorable hero, not cruel at all.

But apparently both Tippy and Cash agree at some point that one is worse than the other, which is plain ridiculous. It just made Cash seem conceited.2) My second problem which isn't as bad is that, nearly every time someone said something remotely funny, other people would \"burst out laughing.\" It was annoying, and something I was told to avoid in school, so why should a published reader not do the same.3) Finally the ending of the book, I knew getting into it that it would most likely be a happy ending, but this was overdone. My problem wasn't that they got together, it was that suddenly Tippy and Rory's mother was sorry for what she'd done, was dying, and in rehab. There could've been some realism, I certainly never expected a happy ending with their mother, and it was an almost out of the blue moment I didn't need."}, {"userName": "Amanda Sheila", "userReviewDate": "May 13, 2013", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/11886105-amanda-sheila", "userReview": "4 stars only because I'm in love with Cash Grier.

Mostly because I already thrilled with Cash & Tippy's romance. And just like what I expected, I loved it! But, one thing that bothers me, is Rory. Tipy's younger brother.

Comprei ele no ano do lan\u00e7amento, em 2008 e s\u00f3 fui ler agora, em 2016. Apesar de j\u00e1 ter ouvido falar muito do livro, fiquei morrendo de medo de ler.Cash Grier \u00e9 um dos meus personagens preferidos da Diana Palmer, sempre achei ele charme com o seu cavanhaque e rabo de cavalo, e o meu maior medo era que a Palmeir\u00e3o estragasse o livro dele, afinal ela tem a fama de simplesmente acabar com os livros dos personagens preferidos. Eu achei alguns problemas com a hist\u00f3ria, teve alguns relinchos e coices, mas nada al\u00e9m do esperado para um mocinho Palmeriano. No geral, at\u00e9 que o Cash n\u00e3o foi esse cavalo todo.A hist\u00f3ria \u00e9 uma continua\u00e7\u00e3o direta de Fora da Lei, ent\u00e3o se voc\u00ea ainda n\u00e3o leu a hist\u00f3ria do asno do Judd Dunn, recomendo que fa\u00e7a esse sacrif\u00edcio (veja pelo lado bom, pelo menos tem o Cash!). A Tippy aparece na historia fazendo um filme e dando em cima do mocinho, no caso o Judd, mas ela e o Cash j\u00e1 tinham uma atra\u00e7\u00e3o muito forte na \u00e9poca. Agora, a atra\u00e7\u00e3o dos dois est\u00e1 maior, mas ele n\u00e3o quer dar o bra\u00e7o a torcer, mas mesmo assim faz \u201cfavores\u201d para a Tippy, como buscar o irm\u00e3ozinho dela no col\u00e9gio. O problema, \u00e9 que como bom mocinho das obras de Diana Palmer, ele tem um lado cavalo que logo p\u00f5e para galopar e escoicear, e, claro, sobra para a Tippy.Simpatizei muito com ela. A Tippy \u00e9 bem humana, tem seus problemas e fraquezas, e claro, tem uma veia de madre Tereza muito forte, e \u00e9 a v\u00edtima perfeita para ser abusada por todos. Agora, o Cash... bem, digamos que ele perdeu algumas estrelinhas na cota\u00e7\u00e3o que eu dava pra ele. Vai ser tapado assim na PQP!!

This book, its like Cash never loved/ infatuated with Cristabel nor is he the brooding hero with a bad past. Tippy was a vamp in that book. The typical gold digger/ lying bi***/ shallow and clingy The sudden change in her character in this book seemed strange. I mean, agreed she had a past and it made her the woman she was but it didnt stop her from being a b**** the first time around so I would have liked if she was a little flawed.. mellowed down eventually. This was one book where I was hoping Cash was as rude to her as DP heroes are to the innocent heroines. May be because I couldnt get over her cruelty in the first book or digest the fact that the women who lied through her teeth out of spite and jealousy in the first book comes out as honest in the second.
