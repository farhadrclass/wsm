I loved the characters, I loved the drama, and I loved the storyline. But, I didn\u2019t love the long drawn out series. Of course, we all knew how the series would end, but it truly became a quest to get to the end. One of the issues I had with this series is the constant rehashing of past circumstances and trials. I understand the need as a writer to want each book to be a standalone novel, but let\u2019s face it . . . if the series is five strong, people need to read the whole series. The writer should not try to summarize past books. It frustrates the true fan that has read each book up to that point. But, who am I to correct or critique Karen Kingsbury. Her stories are inspiring and engaging, and even though I don\u2019t like redundancy, I will continue on and read the Sunrise series and hope that I don\u2019t have to do too much skimming to get past repetitive information."}, {"userName": "Reagan Soper", "userReviewDate": "Dec 29, 2016", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/47738522-reagan-soper", "userReview": "so this book is pretty amazing. when i first read the summary i thought something had happened to Katy's mom. boy, was i wrong. it was really unexpected to see the surprise this book held--Dayne almost killed by a car crash. then on top of it, Luke's attitude. good thing John had found Elizabeth's 10 Secrets To a Happy Marriage, because if he didn't this book would not have been the same.moving on to the sad part of this, when i ended this book i also ended a wonderful series. to anybody wanting to be attached to a book (it is more than a book, it is like a paper family you can connect with) i would recommend this. they have changed my view on things, or even gave some more perspective on what i already believe in. these are great and i'm so glad Karen Kingsbury was kind enough to continue on with these books in different sections."}, {"userName": "Honeypie", "userReviewDate": "Jun 21, 2015", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/10218094-honeypie", "userReview": "I love how Karen Kingsbury shares more stories of God's healing power, how He works miracles in the most seemingly hopeless situations, and what God means by His words -- \"Wait on Me...

Obviously, this series was about the Baxter\u2019s firstborn son, Dayne Matthews. This book brings about Dayne\u2019s hardest struggle yet, when he is involved in a terrible car accident due to paparazzi following him and his movie co-star, Randi Wells. Miraculously, with many prayers, and with Katy always by his side, Dayne makes a complete recovery. But during Dayne\u2019s rehabilitation, he reads a story in the tabloids about his brother, Luke, being quoted as saying Dayne really wasn\u2019t his brother, even if he had the Baxter\u2019s blood. Dayne is sure reconnecting with the Baxter family was a mistake. He should have never brought them into his world, and now their privacy is gone. Katy makes Dayne promise her he would go back to Bloomington for Thanksgiving anyway. If the family didn\u2019t want Dayne to be with them, he made Katy agree they would live in Malibu and give up living in Bloomington. To Dayne and Katy\u2019s surprise, the house they purchased on Lake Monroe was completely restored and remodeled, from the outside in. The Baxter\u2019s and their friends came together to welcome Dayne and Katy home, especially Luke. Luke apologized from the bottom of his heart to Dayne. Dayne forgives him and keeps his offer open of wanting Luke to be his personal lawyer. Because of Dayne\u2019s offer, Luke and his family will be able to move back to the area, Luke working at a branch of his law office in Indianapolis! Ashley has really been a strong part of everything coming together for the family. Being a good friend to Katy, she helps out at CKT. She also went with her father and Katy to Los Angeles when Dayne was in the hospital due to the car accident. Ashley takes responsibility in taking care of the home renovation for Katy and Dayne. Because of Ashley, the house was ready to be moved in by the time Katy and Dayne returned to Bloomington for Thanksgiving. Luke not only was having trouble accepting Dayne as his brother. He was having issues with his marriage to Reagan. Because of his new successful brother, long hours studying for the bar exam, working at the law office, and feeling like Reagan doesn\u2019t appreciate him, Luke was even thinking about separating. Thankfully, his father actually finds a letter his mother had wrote to each of her children titled steps for a happy marriage. When Reagan finds the letter and reads what Elizabeth had written, she realizes it wasn\u2019t only Luke who was in the wrong. Reagan realized she needed to step up too and appreciate Luke\u2019s actions that let her know he loved her. John Baxter tries his best to be there for his children in their good and bad times. He is unsure about what his friendship with Elaine Denning could mean. Ashley is especially not happy with Elaine spending too much time with her father. But after reading her mother\u2019s steps to a happy marriage letter, she realizes her dad needs his friend. Ashley even calls Elaine to ask her if she can help out at Katy and Dayne\u2019s house and invites her for Thanksgiving dessert."}, {"userName": "Melanie", "userReviewDate": "Jul 17, 2017", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/9834339-melanie", "userReview": "Forever is the last book in Karen Kingsbury's Firstborn series and the 10th book in the Baxter Family series.Katy Hart and Dayne Matthews are getting married!! Dayne has decided that he is going to leave Hollywood and live in Bloomington with Katy once they get married. He sends Katy to start looking for a house for them. Without even looking, Katy finds a place that is definitely a fixer upper, but it is the perfect house for them right on the lake. Dayne has breakfast with his co-star before he hops on a plane to go be with Katy at the camp she has been working with the kids all week to do a play at the end of camp.

He is angry. He doesn't want to have an older brother and will never think of Dayne as a brother. He comes out of his building and finds a paparazzi across the street. The guy chases Luke and puts a camera in his face. Luke gets mad and yells at the guy that \"Dayne Matthews isn't my brother.

It is also one of the slower ones and more frustrating ones. For the first part of the book, you slowly wait for Dayne to wake up from his coma. In the second part of the book, Dayne frustrated me to no end with his unappreciation (is that even a word?) for Katy and his own anger with his family. I understand he had the right to feel all the emotions he was feeling, but he still frustrated me. But the ending is definitely worth going through all of this. You finally see everyone resolve all their issues and get the happy ending we have been waiting for. The ending is the reason this book got 4 stars, definitely worth reading through everything to get to that part!"}, {"userName": "Sherri", "userReviewDate": "Nov 07, 2017", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/67890967-sherri", "userReview": "Forever is Fantastic!Karen Kingsbury brings the Firstborn series to a close with a fabulous finish.

They're planning to get married, planning for a house in Bloomington, and trying to get closer to Dayne's birth family. Just when everything seems to be perfect, a tragic accident occurs and suddenly, Dayne is struggling for his life. They need a miracle.Meanwhile, Luke is having marriage trouble. In fact, he's having trouble of every kind as he tries to adjust to the idea of having a brother, especially a brother who is so much more successful than he is. He struggles with jealousy, bitterness, and a feeling of loss from his mother being gone, and it spills over into all areas of his life.Ultimately all must learn to pull together and to really love on each other in words, in acts and in prayer for each other.This book is a much stronger entry into the Baxter series than the last book. I really loved seeing Dayne's growing relationship with God, his entries into relationship with his family, and the way the family surrounds him to give him and Katy an act of love. As usual, here are my thoughts about each point-of-view character.Katy: I've complained about her throughout the series. However, when times were hard in this book, she really shone. She realized that she loved Dayne more than her life in Bloomington. She found a strength in herself beyond caring about the tabloids. She found grace and love within herself as well as determination to get through no matter what. She's someone who has realized what's really important about life and has made adjustments in her actions and speech accordingly. That's a really good thing.Dayne: As I mentioned above, I really loved seeing his spiritual growth, knowing what's going on in his head, and seeing his determination at whatever he puts his mind towards. He spends much of this book in a coma, and yet, his character is not diminished because of it. I'm really pulling for him and for the whole Baxter family, and I've enjoyed the journey through having him as the main character of the story over the past five novels.Ashley: She's another character who often annoys me, but really shines in this book. She puts all her effort into helping Dayne and Katy during their tough time, and she is able to really pull off an excellent act of pure love. It's beautiful, and might be the best part of the book :-)Bailey: She's a teenager, and she's shifting back-and-forth between boys, wondering who she really \"likes\" and who really \"likes\" her. She's also an actress in the kids' theater group, but most of her role in this book is all caught up in her teenage feelings for different boys. Ugh. Reading this made me feel two things: (1) Old, (2) Like these days are coming up way too fast for my own children!!John: He has a beautiful emotional range, and I have really enjoyed his role in all five of these books. I would never have wanted Kingsbury to kill off his wife, but he has really shone as he has dealt with that, with finding his child, and with navigating the waters of his life post-spousal death. I have been enjoying the budding relationship with Elaine, and despite a first blip in it this book, I am hoping that Kingsbury writes much, much more about them. I also nearly cry as he remembers his wife, re-reads her old letters and wishes that she was there to see their family now.Luke: I just wanted to hang my head a few times at how spoiled he was acting this book. A new brother, and he's so jealous that can't stand it. He also feels like a failure because his life is not the way that he had always dreamed and he feels like less than a man as he still can't provide for his wife and young children. He really pulls it together by the end of the book, but not before causing his wife and his whole family a ton of drama.Jenny: She only has one or two point of view sections in the book. Mostly she's there to provide a calmer, more adult perspective on Bailey's teen drama. She's enjoyable to read, and I always want to hear more from her view on life.Reagan: There are problems between Reagan and Luke, and Reagan begins the book feeling like they're all Luke's fault. In fact, her life isn't going the way she would like, and she feels like it's Luke's fault. She's still holding grudges from when they got pregnant out of wedlock, and she doesn't even realize it until things are bad enough between them that the word separation comes up. She has to realize that the downward direction of her marriage is not solely Luke's fault but that she has a lot to learn and to atone for in the wrong way she has treated Luke. It's a realization that I've had to make in my life, and it's a good one.That's all for this Firstborn series of Baxter books. It's a strong finish, enough to keep me reading on into the next series :-) I'm looking forward to hearing more adventures of the family. After all, Kingsbury hasn't even gotten Dayne and Katy married yet!"}, {"userName": "Robyn Schlichter", "userReviewDate": "Jul 27, 2017", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/36562213-robyn-schlichter", "userReview": "Wonderful!"}, {"userName": "Mandy Huot", "userReviewDate": "Mar 11, 2017", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/2978406-mandy-huot", "userReview": "another lovely book by karen!"}, {"userName": "Laura Beasley", "userReviewDate": "Sep 11, 2015", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/3424861-laura-beasley", "userReview": "The last in the series and once again a great book.

The references to story lines in previous books didn\u2019t seem bother me as much as some who have written about that \u2013 maybe I\u2019m just so eager to keep reading that I tend to skim over any repetition.The Baxter family story lines were heartwarming and realistic. There were plenty of the same conflicts that all of us face at one time or another, and tragedies too. But blessings abound. I found the books to be an encouragement.

That statement alone probably tells you whether or not this is for you.\" The same applies to Forever the series' finale. I must also say that the ending segues into the events of the next series, and will make you want to get your hands on Sunrise, the subsequent Baxter tale, as soon as you can. (Yes, I already have a copy.) One other positive comment: One of Ms. Kingsbury's strengths is describing what's going on in her characters' minds, and that talent shines even brighter in this novel than in her previous works.
