I will attest, however, that keeping this book by the bedside is one of the best ways to enjoy it. Wodehouse's short fiction is similar enough as to be potentially tedious when read all in a chunk; however, spacing it out over individual nights allows for one to enjoy the familiarity while appreciating the language and wit that makes each story unique. Perfect for enjoying as a before-bed tidbit, especially with a nightcap."}, {"userName": "Al", "userReviewDate": "Jan 25, 2014", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/733624-al", "userReview": "This chunky volume contains a wide range of Wodehouse stories and situations, conveniently grouped, including Jeeves (of course), Mulliner, Ukridge, Drones Club, and more. The variety is interesting, although it proved that my interest in Wodehouse stories falls off rapidly once the Jeeves canon has been fired, so to speak. There are only five Jeeves stories here, a mere 100 pages of more than 600, so if you're seeking only his company it's probably best to look elsewhere for your entertainment. That said, this does provide a convenient sampler if you want to see what else Wodehouse has to offer."}, {"userName": "Victoria", "userReviewDate": "Jan 20, 2009", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/1652450-victoria", "userReview": "What I learned from this book was that I should never get rid of it no matter how badly it's falling apart. I like that the book presents a sampling of short stories from each of the Wodehouse's various series of short stories. I first read these stories in the 1970's and still laugh as I reread them. My favorite series of stories is the golfing stories, but my favorite individual story is that all-time classic 'A Bit of Luck for Mable.'"}, {"userName": "Kelly", "userReviewDate": "May 07, 2008", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/94602-kelly", "userReview": "Its Wodehouse.

On the cover of my paperback copy, it claims to be \"the most lavish collection\" of Wodehouse stories \"ever published.\" Likely true. There are 31 amusingly sculpted short stories and a delightful novel, Quick Service. As one who majored in English Literature, I must say that Sir Pelham Grenville Wodehouse, KBE and the man who brought Jeeves into the world, continues to deserve the attention he so rightly earned as one of the most widely read British humorists of the 20th century. If you adored John Cleese in Faulty Towers, as I did and do, I'm quite sure you would enjoy the stories of P.G. Wodehouse. Try a short story. Consider this sentence, \"Mr. Duff had halted and was swaying gently, as if he had been poleaxed and could not make up his mind which way to fall.\" Now that is a dandy descriptive sentence if there ever was one.

Wodehouse's books. I think he started publishing around 1918 or 19 and carried on through the 50s. This book has been on my to-read shelf for a long time, and I'm sorry I didn't pull it down before.There are many collections of his works, as well as individual stories. This one includes about 5 stories each from \"The Drone's Club,\" \"Mr. Mulliner,\" stories about golf (gowf), Jeeves the best butler in the world, and Wodehouse's novel, \"Quick Service.\" I thought the stories about the members of The Drone's Club were the funniest, with \"Uncle Fred Flits By\" as the best of those. If you recall the bits Monty Python did about twits,(twits being stupid, homely, awkward, worthless members of the wealthy class in England, I think), this is the same group Wodehouse was making fun of years before.They are forever falling in \"love at first sight\" with some ravishing vicar's daughter, with limpid blue eyes, and curly blond hair, who refuses to give them the time of day until theya)dress better b)do volunteer work c)take up golf, or some other remote challenge that will keep them out of her sight for a while.Mr. Mulliner is a permanent fixture at the bar at The Angler's Rest, which I imagine to be something like Fawlty Towers. No matter what anyone else says (and everyone else is identified by what they're drinking such as ginger-and-a-splash), Mr. Mulliner has a nephew who knows all about it, had an even worse case of it, or was even braver in the face of it.I don't have the book in front of me, but there's a section about Ukridge, a man who's always scheming to get some money out of his wealthy aunt or any friend foolish enough to be talked into investing. I think his name is Stanley Featherington Ukridge.Wodehouse's names that he gives these men and the quaint places in the country which they retire to when London gets to be too much for them are hilarious.The first chapter of the golf stories is about how golf came to the country from far away Scotland in olden times. The locals decided it must be some heathen religion, worshipping the god Gowf. Everyone ended up throwing over their old religious gods, and taking up the mysterious practice.Well, I didn't mean to ramble on so long, but if you like laughing at the upper-class British, you'll find this or any of Wodehouse's books a hoot."}, {"userName": "Ruth", "userReviewDate": "Feb 02, 2009", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/1416312-ruth", "userReview": "The back of The Most of P. G. Wodehouse declares this to be the \"most lavish P. G. Wodehouse collection ever published,\" and when one considers the breadth of selection crammed into just over 700 pages, it's hard to argue with the publisher's assertion. Wodehouse's writing career spanned over forty years, and while I am far from being able to claim that I've read even a third of his output, in my opinion his genius and comic timing rarely faltered. Probably Wodehouse's best known creations are Bertie Wooster and his indefatigable valet, Jeeves (memorably portrayed by Hugh Laurie and Stephen Fry, respectively). The pair is represented here by five short stories. As I recently acquired Jeeves & Wooster - The Complete Series, I have to say that Laurie and Fry captured the characters so perfectly that I now hear their voices in my head when I read the J&W tales. Wooster's cronies at The Drones Club are represented by seven stories - \"Tried in the Furnace\" and \"Goodbye to All Cats\" are particularly hilarious. There are seven Mr. Mulliner stories, where he sagely dispenses his life wisdom based on the experiences of various and sundry members of his incredibly large family - I especially liked the story \"Mulliner's Buck-U-Uppo.\" In five stories one can read five of Stanley Featherstonehaugh Ukridge's wildly whacky money-making schemes, and there's a brief stop at Blandings Castle, home of Lord Emsworth and his prized pig the Empress of Blandings. There are five of the Golf Stories, and they were an absolutely revelation - so hilarious, and I am not a fan of golf in the least. The one complete novel, Quick Service, is a solid representation of Wodehouse's full-length fiction, full of romantic entanglements and comic misunderstandings. Wodehouse's sense of humor and command of the English language make his stories and novels an absolute joy to read, and this anthology is probably one of the best introductions out there. Read, enjoy, and laugh till you cry."}, {"userName": "Peter Krol", "userReviewDate": "Mar 23, 2009", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/623325-peter-krol", "userReview": "Here's an example of why people read for fun:\"How long Archibald slept he could not have said. He woke some hours later with a vague feeling that a thunderstorm of unusual violence had broken out in his immediate neighborhood. But this, he realized as the mists of slumber cleared away, was an error. The noise which had disturbed him was not thunder but the sound of someone snoring. Snoring like the dickens. The walls seemed to be vibrating like the deck of an ocean liner....\"His spirit was not so completely broken as to make him lie supinely down beneath that snoring. The sound filled him, as snoring fills every right-thinking man, with a seething resentment and a passionate yearning for justice, and he climbed out of bed with the intention of taking the proper steps through the recognized channels. It is the custom nowadays to disparage the educational methods of the English public school and to maintain that they are not practical and of a kind to fit the growing boy for the problems of afterlife. But you do learn one thing at a public school, and that is how to act when somebody starts snoring.\"You jolly well grab a cake of soap and pop in and stuff it down the blighter's throat. And this is what Archibald proposed - God willing - to do\" (p.186)."}, {"userName": "El", "userReviewDate": "Dec 21, 2007", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/83144-el", "userReview": "P.G. Wodehouse is one of those authors I have always meant to read as his name seems to always come up in strange places (Trivial Pursuit, Gilmore Girls), and I seem to always have known who Jeeves and Wooster were, without knowing the full context.This collection includes a large selection of his most-known characters, not excluding, of course, the upstanding Jeeves. Wodehouse had a way of mixing subtle humor with extraordinary circumstances that made it difficult to turn down - the first group of stories involving Freddie Widgeon are perhaps the best in the whole book.The last of the book is a short novel, Quick Service, which is probably mostly lost on me. Going from a collection of short stories to a novella in the same book was hard for me to wrap my mind around, and I seemed to have zoned out for a good portion of the beginning of the story. It was not completely worthless - it was written in the same Wodehouse manner - but it's possible I was done with Wodehouse before I realized it, and I took it too far by insisting on reading the whole book.

The hero of \"Quick Service,\" Joss Weatherby, almost combines some more famous Wodehouse tropes: young man a-wooing, and Jeeves-like \"shining with the light of intelligence.\" \"Reverent Wooing\" contains a priceless imitation of a hen laying an egg, and the line (quoted from memory), \"If brains were silk, Archibald would not have had enough to make a canary a pair of cami-knickers.\"The Ukridge stories are a bit annoying, but Wodehouse at his least is still amusing.A quote from Joseph Bottum, who wrote an article arguing that Wodehouse's perfection raised his work to a religious experience:\"Words were all that P.G. Wodehouse had, and in one sense he squandered them on nothing more than light comedy. In another sense, he found with all his writing something worth more than words can say: a small, happy spot kept bright in a world that seemed only to be darkening around it.
