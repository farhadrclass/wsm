I wanted to, but the plot was too predictable and the characters kind of annoying and unbelievable, in some ways. It depicts a fascinating period in American history that isn't in history books - racism toward Chinese Americans at the turn of the century, which went hand in hand with the Exclusion Act of 1882. I love the setting - the San Juan Islands. The plot itself makes the story fun, but I was really hoping for some curve balls, like when they found one person's diary (trying not to spoil it) and it almost sounded like it was going to go down another path, looking into that character, but it didn't. But overall, it was an easy read and was really interesting, so if you're into interesting stories that weave in historical elements, and if you don't mind predictable endings, then I'd recommend it."}, {"userName": "Lori", "userReviewDate": "Nov 24, 2015", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/3332895-lori", "userReview": "What a fabulous debut novel.

The main thought swirling in my head was \"People really never change\". Maybe I'm feeling hypersensitive after all the horrible events that have happened lately in the cause of hatred; a mass shooting, murder of a respected British MP, threats against mosques in a local city, and some of the day to day vitriol spewed in social media comments. Increasingly I question where has compassion gone in our society? It wasn't found in Pacific Northwest society in the 1880-1890s (and probably later than that) for the Chinese peoples living and supporting the cities there. The Girl Who Wrote in Silk highlights a perhaps lesser known period of United States history in which legislation was passed requiring the deportation of Chinese people back to China. It mentions legislation in which it was forbidden to hire Chinese workers for business owners. Mass deportation, crimes against a people, violence, death, and social prejudices that should make everyone of us squirm in shame. I know I did as I read this book. It was truly a shameful period in history.  But Estes also highlights the human capacity to forgive and remember the mistakes made by forebears so not repeat them again. If only this was true across the test of time as history seems to repeat itself, just using different races/cultures as scapegoats. However, in the case of Inara Erickson as she explores her family's history which turns dark; she discovers redemption in an attempt to right a wrong done to a Chinese family many years ago. Inara's story intertwines with the telling of Mei Lien's story which begins in the late 1880s in Seattle. Inara discovers an embroidered sleeve hidden in the floor boards of her family's estate that she is restoring to a boutique hotel. When she contacts a local professor regarding the find; she embarks on a journey of discovery in Mei Lien's life, loves, and heartbreak. When the Mei's story takes a deeply personal turn for Inara, choices have to be made. Choices based on justice, decency, secrets, and love."}, {"userName": "Cristine Mermaid", "userReviewDate": "Dec 10, 2015", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/7782584-cristine-mermaid", "userReview": "This book is an easy read and the story is compelling and I found myself very drawn into it. However, the writing itself is very cliche, bordering on cheesy at points. I did very much enjoy learning about the Orcas Islands and horrified to learn of how the Chinese-Americans were treated during this time period. I became attached to Mei and her husband but couldn't warm up to Inara who's big problem in life was deciding if she should pursue a career in international relations that was offered to her by Starbucks. The love story was way too predictable and almost laughable with some of the trite expressions but as I said, easy to read and it compelled me to do some research on the Chinese during this time period. I thought the author's use of the sleeve with a story was downright brilliant and I was also impressed by her descriptions of Chinese spirituality. I almost felt like it was two authors, one who was writing the deep and complicated parts of the past and one who was a Danielle Steele , Lifetime for women author who was breezily babbling about the present and making my eyeballs roll."}, {"userName": "Stacey", "userReviewDate": "Feb 15, 2017", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/399175-stacey", "userReview": "Set in the Seattle area this a page turner that goes back and forth from the late 1800's in Washington Territory to present.

What she finds is more than a hidden passion to resurrect the old property, but family secrets surface when she discovers an ornately embroidered piece of silk from a robe hidden under the floorboards. This is very good and prompted me to look more into The Chinese Exclusion Act of 1882. It's sad that the Chinese were treated in a hateful way and forced to leave a country they called home.

A co-worker recommended this story to me a few months ago, and I am glad that I put it on my list. It was an easy listen and it was able to get and keep my interest.Over the past couple of years I have developed a fondness for historical fiction which came at a bit of a surprise to me. I never liked history in school, but I'm starting to think that is because it was too often associated with long lists of names and dates... neither of which I'm particularly good at memorizing. Historical fiction has provided me with a way to learn about history in an interesting way. Before this book, I never knew about the Chinese Exclusion Act of 1882 that prevented the immigration of most Chinese to the United States until 1943. Listening to Mei Lein's story was so heartbreaking. I will never understand disliking someone merely because they look different than you. And I definitely will never understand torturing (whether physically or mentally) and murdering those people because you don't share the same skin tone. This story was told from two perspectives a little over a century apart. Mei Lein's story was told from the 1880s and 1890s while Inara's was told from the present day perspective after she finds an embroidered sleeve hidden in the house her recently deceased aunt left her. While I did enjoy both stories, Mei Lein's was the most interesting to me. Her's seemed to contain more depth while Inara's story was very predictable and perhaps a bit cliche."}, {"userName": "Elizabeth of Silver's Reviews", "userReviewDate": "Jun 02, 2015", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/1882027-elizabeth-of-silver-s-reviews", "userReview": "Did Mei Lien stand on the edge of the boat's railing because she knew she had to or because she was forced to be there?

There is a modern story in which a young woman finds a piece of silk embroidery which she used to learn about the Chinese woman's story. This book was poorly written and full of bad cliches. Also, ridiculous coincidences and over the top love scenes. While it tells an important story about the Chinese people and their history in the Western part of the U.S it would have been better told in the hands of a more talented author.

It really is a compelling, feel good story. I really do not like sappy romance novels although sometimes they can be a fun read. This is NOT a sappy romance novel but there is romance involved. There is love in two time lines and I really liked that part of it. This book is written in a dual time line format, one in 1886 and one hundred years later, in \"present day\". What I liked about this one, is that I did not ever feel rushed to get back to or stay in one time line or the other. The flow and transition was perfectly balanced. I appreciated them both for their own story that they each had to tell. Beautifully done.The 1886 time line story is about a young Chinese girl, in Seattle, Washington Territory. It is a terrible time for the Chinese all up and down the west coast from California to British Columbia. The rail roads, all built with cheap Chinese, Irish, Italian, and other foreign ethnic labor have been completed. The economy of the US has been in a recession since early 1880. No one wants the left over Chinese and their families and their work hard ethics taking jobs from white workers and sending money back home to support their family left behind. They want them gone on the west coast, just like they wanted the black laborers and their families gone on the east coast after they were emancipated. Be prepared.The present day story is about a young woman who inherits her familie's vacation home and estate on Orcas Island, in the San Juan Islands, Washington. She wants to start her own business and gets her father to back her. She finds something and wants to know more about what it is and what it means. She searches for someone to help her research it, and meets a nice College professor who helps her. Be prepared.This book is the reason I love historical fiction.

Inara inherited her aunt's waterfront estate on Orcas Island in Washington state. While examining a loose stair, she found a beautiful piece of fabric embroidered with Chinese symbols and designs. She took it to a professor familiar with Chinese history, and their research led back to the 1880s when the Chinese were violently forced from their homes along the Pacific coast.The book alternates between the contemporary story and a touching historical story set in the late 19th Century about Mei Lien and her family. Mei Lien embroidered lovely designs showing her family's history, the tragic loss of some family members, and her love for her husband and child.The historical story of racial prejudice was heartbreaking, and showed a part of Chinese-American history that is rarely discussed. While I found this part of the book interesting, the contemporary part of the novel did not work as well. There were too many coincidences to feel believable. Inara's father, the head of a shipping company, seemed unrealistic when he discussed business decisions about the inherited estate with his daughter.I'm glad I read the book because I liked the character of Mei Lien, and the San Juan Islands setting. The book told about how Chinese-Americans were ostracized, the Chinese Exclusion Act of 1882, the Geary Act of 1892, and the social price of an interracial marriage.

No, okay, no. The book is plagued with mediocre writing and research, and the plot suffers from clich\u00e9, coincidence, and sappy romance. I love the Pacific Northwest. It's one of my favorite places to visit, but Estes punts on the setting, and honestly the book could have been set on any island (I'm thinking specifically of Gemini and Astoria, which really captured the feel, the atmosphere of the area). The book is riddled with missteps from the minor --hiking wasn't in common usage until the 1940s, prior to that it was walking or mountaineering-- to the hysterical --shipping-magnate daughter Inara worries about her student loans, and math makes a character approximately 118, yet it isn't mentioned that she's unspeakably old. Let's not even start on the internalized racism of Mei Lein referring to herself as slant-eyed. Toss on to the pile that Estes warped Seattle's history to fit her plot, and I would be hard pressed to find any value to this book. Seriously, the only thing that caught it that extra star is the scene where Mei Lein says goodbye to her child, and Estes writes of it movingly. Otherwise, this would be on the would-use-as-toliet-paper 1-star list. As I often find is the case, however, book discussion was an absolute hoot. Most of the group liked it better than I did, but neither the romance nor the heavy coincidences were well-favored, and people with expertise in other area pointed out a couple of flaws I hadn't noticed/hand-waved.

And it's quite possibly the best historical fiction I've ever read. The story and the characters have stayed with me even though I finished the book last week. I listed to the audio version and it is excellent, done by Emily Woo Zeller. There are two protagonists, one present day, Inara Erickson, who has inherited her aunt's estate, a house on Orcas Island. She spent many happy hours during her childhood, but she is planning on selling the estate and begin working for Starbucks. She comes from a wealthy family which runs a maritime shipping company. Let me pause here to say that what I love about historical fiction is learning. Reading this book, I learned more about the Seattle area and the San Juan group of islands just off the Washington coast. I would love to go there and see it first hand, rather than what I saw on the Internet. Now back to the book. The second protagonist is Liu Mei Lien (Liu is her surname), who lived in the 1880s in what is now the Seattle area. Because she and her father are Chinese, they are forced to leave there even though her father has a business. We learn what happens to Mei Lien and how her life intersects with Inara's. The writing is wonderful, and the characters are so real that you are a part of the story. I did something I've never done before--I began listening to the book on Thursday and listened most of that day. (My husband was gone almost all day and into the evening.) I was awake much of the night and then the next morning finished the book--in about a 24-hour period. And I wish I could go back and listen again. This is a first novel for Kelli Estes.

She is rescued by a kind man named Joseph McElroy. Joseph promises to keep her safe in spite of the discrimination that prevails against Chinese in his community. Mei Lien is afraid to trust this white man, but sees no other choice.In present day, Inara Erickson discovers an intricately embroidered sleeve hidden in a staircase in the family estate she has just inherited from her aunt. Intrigued by the story told in pictures on the garment, she finds a historian named Daniel to help her interpret the meaning. Initally, Inara intends to sell the estate to pay off her college debt. Being back where she shared many family memories as a child, she quickly becomes attached and decides to honor her dead aunt's wish to convert the estate to a hotel. She persuades her father to invest in her dream. His actions are often infuriating until he somewhat lamely explains them at the end. The way Mei Lien, Inara, and other characters' lives entwine creates a richly textured, often sad story. It took me almost halfway through the novel to connect with the characters and that made it a slow read at first.

This book uses the violence against Chinese immigrants residing on the west coast during the end of the 19th century as its backdrop. The usual range of arguments were employed. First, there was the economic one of Chinese laborers taking jobs from Americans. Then there were the blatant racist arguments about an existential threat to the superior white race. In 1882 the Chinese Exclusion Act was passed and signed into law by President Chester Allen Arthur. It was a race-based immigration restriction law which in effect legitimized anti-Chinese sentiment. Labor unions and business leaders organized violent attacks on Chinese residents in California, Colorado, Idaho, Oregon and Washington. THE GIRL WHO WROTE IN SILK was inspired by the expulsion of all Chinese from Seattle, and the nearly successful expulsion from Tacoma.Following an enigmatic prologue set in 1886 the novel opens in the present day when Inara Campbell Erickson discovers an intricately embroidered silk sleeve hidden in the stair tread of their family mansion on Orcas Island. Inara had planned to put the aged estate on the market before assuming a prominent corporate position in international finance. The family is steeped in local history. Their patriarch Duncan Campbell became a wealthy shipping magnate and civic leader. Inara's father now runs the company and is grooming her brother to succeed him. Campbell was Inara's great great great grandfather and built the mansion in the 1880's when Washington was still a territory. Inara is intrigued by the silk fragment and sets out to research its origin. At the same time, she begins to consider the hopes of her great great aunt Dahlia from whom she inherited the estate. Inara felt close to Aunt Dahlia but left the island when she was 15 after her mother's fatal car accident. The run-down mansion rekindles warm memories in Inara and she commits to Aunt Dahlia's dream of converting the mansion into a hostelry. The scenic setting is perfect, the mansion has historic significance, and her neighbor is a contractor who had helped Dahlia draw up detailed plans for the project. Author Keilli Estes splits her narrative between the contemporary story of Inara and the 19th century story of a Chinese woman named Mei Lien who was born in Seattle. The historical narrative is the more interesting of the two. The contemporary story is marred by improbable actions, one too many coincidence, and several predictable plot turns. The historical narrative, on the other hand, is infused with human emotion that commands the reader's empathy. This book was a selection of a local book club. I am giving this book only 3 stars because of the flaws in the contemporary sections and the book's reliance on plot to propel the story. However, its content is highly relevant. It exposes an overlooked chapter in American history, and demands that we acknowledge a flawed historical legacy that distorts the truth.

I kind of hate giving it just 3 stars because it managed to keep me well entertained in the short time it took to read. The history which is a focal point in \"The Girl Who Wrote in Silk\" centres on the late 1800s, when Chinese immigrants who had been brought to North America in the thousands to build railroads across the continent in both the USA and Canada were no longer needed. The rail lines were finished, the masters of industry were establishing their power bases nearer to urban centres and the thousands of Chinese who were in the West had to establish some other way to create income. The Gold Rush was over too. These details, unfortunately, were not explained as well as they could have been to give the novel greater context. The glut of the unemployed led to a severe backlash against the Chinese who were settling in urban centres, using their old country skills to make a living and actually improve the finances of many Caucasian businessmen. Tempers and racism flared, however, and the Chinese were treated terribly, forced from their homes and businesses by the Exclusion Act and totally purged in many cases from cities. Mei Lien is the fictitious daughter of Chinese immigrants in Seattle during this period, in the novel. In the present, Inara Erickson is freshly out of grad school and intent on refurbishing the old family estate situated on Orcas Island, Washington. Inara finds an embroidered sleeve inside of the footwell of one of the steps in the house staircase, which leads her to investigate not only the artisan who created the silk thread story but the history of the house and her family as well. The interlocking stories are well told, switching back and forth from Mei Lien and Inara. The attitudes of both eras are well represented; the Chinese story is apparently not especially well known in the USA, unlike Canada. The piece of especially damning history, which I will not relate because it is a spoiler, did not occur as told in the novel.  I quote the back cover of the trade paperback: \"Inspired by real events...\". In truth, the real events were disparate and not remotely connected to a large part of this novel, and which I had to look for in the \"Conversation with the Author\" midway through reading. To misrepresent actual events in history for the purpose of drama, around a very serious real historical issue, is rather \"Hollywood\" in its design and the novel should not be referenced as \"real\" on its fly leaf or back cover. Good historical fiction rarely comes without notes, or references to sources, especially when it has such a serious point of view. Kelli Estes had \"good bones\" for her novel. I liked so much about it. But in the end, unfortunately, it was ultimately a romance novel. I guess that is why I'm so indignant over the historical convolution. Atonement and resolution are achieved through romance.

The story told here is a tragic one - it highlights the racism towards Chinese Americans during the late 1800's, bringing the consequences of the Exclusion Act of 1882 into sharp focus.The San Juan Islands make a beautiful setting, and the character of Mei Lein kept me interested in the story, though my heart hurt for her much of the time. I admit that the contemporary story line was not as compelling for me. Although I liked Inara's character, I thought the romantic thread in the present day was rushed and a bit forced, so I didn't feel her pain and emotion like I would have liked.Some reviewers said that the plot was predictable, and it was, but predictability in stories like these don't really bother me. With tragic parts of history, it softens the blow a bit. However, if it is going to be predictable, I prefer a strong emotions from the character and a sense of high stakes. In the present day, that just wasn't there for me.In terms of the actual audio, the narrator does a great job with the different tones of voice and has a nice inflection to her voice. The story itself wasn't my favorite, but I'm still glad I listened to it. I feel like I learned something of value while also being entertained, and that goes a long way in my enjoyment of a book."}, {"userName": "Debbie", "userReviewDate": "Jun 09, 2015", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/12691311-debbie", "userReview": "Wow, when offered this book, I turned it down. Then I got an ARC in the mail and said okay I would give it a try. Thanks Sourcebooks for being so pushy Ha! Without it, I would have missed a really, really great book. Yet again in a fiction book, I learned that America was deporting, killing, whatever it took, to get the Chinese out of the country. This actually took place from the late 1800's to the early 1900's. I had never known about that. It was mostly happening in the west as that's where the influx of the Chinese immigrants were living. This was a horrid, yet beautiful story showing present day people discovering what happened to and with their ancestors during this time. Of course, it was a little hokey how the lovers were related of sorts, but it still made for a great story. While I usually have problems with the Chinese names due to my in familiarity with the language, this is did not occur in this book as there weren't that many Chinese characters. Kelli Estes, you have written an awesome debut novel. Kudo's to you!!! I would highly recommend this to anyone who likes historical fiction or ancestry.Thanks you Sourcebooks and Net Galley for providing me with this ARC and e-galley in exchange for an honest review!"}, {"userName": "Melissa", "userReviewDate": "Mar 23, 2016", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/2272883-melissa", "userReview": "Sometimes, I'm in the mood for historical fiction; however, I like my historical fiction to be more dramatic and less romance-y. This book had both elements, so I found myself sometimes engaged and sometimes not. Alternating between the past and present, we follow the tale of a young Chinese woman who survived a terrible event only to suffer the devastating loss of her family in a time and place when Chinese were persona non grata in America and young woman of present day who happens upon an embroidered sleeve hidden in her ancestral home. I enjoyed the historical side of this story very much and patiently listened through the goofy romantic banter of the present day protagonist to get to the good parts."}, {"userName": "Debbie Floyd", "userReviewDate": "Mar 22, 2017", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/5120996-debbie-floyd", "userReview": "I have always enjoyed history and historical fiction has a way of bringing history to life. Even though the stories told about these particular families are fiction, the experiences of the Chinese in the history of America are all to real. It is important that history be told so that we never repeat again some of the things that have occurred in our history.

It wasn't perfect, but it did have a good story based in history. I like books that weave two story lines together and this one did. I was more drawn to Mei Lein's story in the later decades of the 1800s than I was to Inara's story in the present. Living on the east coast, I didn't realize how badly the Chinese immigrants were treated in the western part of the country. The book grabbed my attention from the very beginning. What a way to start a book! I have read a few reviews where people have stopped reading the book, but I can bet that most of them didn't stop right after that first chapter. It was an attention-grabber and it left me with many questions that were answered as I read on. I did think there were perhaps a few too many coincidences, but since Ms. Estes is a first time author I figure she will have less of these in subsequent books."}, {"userName": "Joshua Gross", "userReviewDate": "Jun 25, 2015", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/4296574-joshua-gross", "userReview": "I gave up. I wasn't that interested in the first place, I was annoyed right off the bat by Inara, who's big problem is whether she should turn down her lucrative Starbucks corp. offer right after college or should she renovate and restore an old mansion and turn it into a bed and breakfast. I wish I had those problems. I'm sure the book probably improves but I have a sneaking suspicion there might be some romance involved. I did like reading about them travelling to Port Townsend back in the 1800's since I've spent a lot of time there but ultimately it wasn't holding my attention, it wasn't strong writing, and there are a BILLION other books I'm dying to read. So I have to go to this book signing tomorrow after we discuss it at book club. Who knows, maybe I didn't give it a fair shot and everyone will tell me it was amazing, but I'm glad I'm reading something else now.

I am not sure if it is because I am on vacation and was able to read it all the way through in a short period of time or what. I liked the way the author blended the past and the present. The book flowed well and I was able to follow it without having to go back a reread sections to figure out what was going on. I could relate to the characters, as I feel they were developed well. I enjoy historical fiction and this covered an era I have not read a lot about, which is also why it held my interest. I would highly recommend this book to lovers of historical fiction.

The author does an excellent job of developing these story threads and then weaving together. Both sets of characters are interesting, but I think the storyline set in the past is the more compelling one. Though a bit contrived at times, the novel is an entertaining and informative read. Sad at times, it flows on to a satisfying conclusion, even though some questions remain unanswered."}, {"userName": "Meg - A Bookish Affair", "userReviewDate": "Jul 01, 2015", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/1132408-meg---a-bookish-affair", "userReview": "4.5 stars. \"The Girl Who Wrote in Silk\" is a historical fiction dual narrative with one part told in the present and one in the past. Both parts are set in the islands just off of Washington state, close to Seattle. The past part is set in the late 1800s, a time when white residents of the Seattle area and many other parts of the country were trying to get rid of Chinese people in the area. Although the Chinese people had done many things like worked on the railroads and done other labor that was difficult to get white people to do, there was a general distrust and hatred of the Chinese. Mei Lien and her family are some of the Chinese that the white people are getting rid of. They are told to get on a ship to go back to China but the captain of the ship really plans to throw all of the people off before it leaves the coast. Mei Lien escapes from the ship and goes to make her life on one of the islands near Seattle. She will still face prejudice but it's better than the alternative. In the present day, Inara is a young woman from a rich family who is involved with real estate and investments. Inara would like to do something different then the job that her father has lined up for her. She'd like to take the house that her relatives left to her after they died and turn it into a boutique hotel. She finds that the history of the house and how her ancestors got it is more than just a little unsettling.Dual narratives are a little bit of a mixed bag for me. Sometimes I really like them and other times I don't. Most of the time I really like the historical aspect and dislike the present. In the case of this book I really liked both the past and the present narratives and thought they fit together beautifully. Inara discovers a a sleeve that goes to a robe in the old house. The sleeve has all sorts of different embroidery on it. The action of The book focuses on the sleeve and how it came to be.I really like that does book covered a topic diet isn't discussed a lot. The United States is more inclusive of people of diverse backgrounds than it used to be. In the late 1800s and early 1900s, there were many exclusionary policies that focused on excluding huge groups of people that were seen as unsavory the policies were totally unfair. For instance in the case of Mei Lien, she was supposed to be sent back to China because she's of Chinese descent even though she had been born in the states and had never been to China. It was hard to read about this difficult history but although this book is fiction, I think books like this that cover some of the more unsavory parts of history are important. Those who forget the past are doomed to repeat it and what not. The author did a really good job of bringing the history and feelings of the time to life.I would recommend this book for anyone who wants to be enveloped and a historical fiction tale that tackle some pretty difficult subjects!"}, {"userName": "Christine", "userReviewDate": "Sep 28, 2016", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/2085099-christine", "userReview": "I really loved this for a debut novel.
