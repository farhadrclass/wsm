But she has spent the last years trying to make amends for all the lives she has taken as a reaper by saving lives. She has not many lives left to save until she can settle down and be a wife to Gregory, the boy she loves and who promised to wait for her. But then she saves a young boy from drowning and suddenly she must do everything in her power to save him from his father who wants him dead.I was a bit skeptic to the book in the beginning and I had a hard time getting into the story. But tenacity made me continue with the book and it got better and even though I wasn't that compelled by the story did I like the world that Pauline Creeden had created. That subtle blend between a steampunk world and ordinary world. Steel horses, zeppelins, witches etc. made the story richer and made this YA much, much more interesting to read.Raven was a good character, and I liked Monroe Strider another reaper who she meets on the journey to save Darius, the young boy. I wasn't that interested in the predictable relationship between Raven and Captain Jack Grant, the man who hunted her.I'm not that fond of YA, mostly because they often (according to me) lack any depth. This ended up better than I expected. Still, I wasn't drawn into the story in a way that made me forget time and place. But at least, the book didn't have a love triangle...Thank you Netgalley for providing me with a free copy for an honest review!"}, {"userName": "Patty ", "userReviewDate": "Sep 16, 2014", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/12058411-patty", "userReview": "3.5 Stars\n\u201cRAVEN STEELE COUNTED every footstep she chanced through New Haven with the knowledge that any could be her last. But the gamble wouldn\u2019t last long. She quickened her pace. Only two kilometers of brownstone street stood between her and the safety of the forest.\u201d\nI always try to be 100% fair when it comes to genres, but I will be completely honest and say that I used to (okay, I kind of still do) avoid the Steampunk genre. Why? Because to be honest I don't always fully understand it. To some it's an easy concept, to others it's complex. And the most important thing is finding an author who can write and write it well! I have definitely found that in Pauline Creeden. This was my first read by her and boy was it ever interesting and intense!We were lucky enough to receive Raven in different formats. I kept going back and forth between ebook and PDF version, the ebook version was easier to read on the go. While the PDF version I could sit and read while on my laptop and state at the detailing in the front choice, the headers for each chapter, and the design! It's so beautiful! I'm hoping that the physical copy will look like this because if it does I will buy it!!I really, really liked the characters we are introduced to! Raven was strong, and a kick-ass kind of girl but she was vulnerable which made her more realistic and a relatable character to readers. Jack, well he's Captain Jack Grant. Although, I have to say that as much as I was somewhat rooting for Raven and Jack I'm not sure if I'm 100% team Jack. I just feel like the romance was rushed and I would have rather there been a more drastic tie in to their feelings for each other. I didn't get the ending I wanted, it wasn't a bad ending. I was just...wanting more. I don't want to give anything away, but I have high hopes for what might develop in the following book or books...please let it be books.What kept Raven from getting 5 stars?I chop this up to it probably being more \"it's me, not you\". This was difficult for me to read and I had a very hard time getting into to. It took me longer than expected to finish this (6 days) and I was just starting to get frustrated. I really wanted to invest myself into this book but couldn't do it. I think I just wasn't in the right mind set for it, but it did affect me being able to enjoy this story from beginning to end.---Overall, Raven was a read I won't be forgetting about anytime soon. If anything, it's opened my eyes to this genre. Would I recommend Raven? Yes, especially if your lucky for a book to test out the steampunk genre with. Will I be continuing with there series? YES! I can't wait until The Chronicles of Steele: Darius comes out in 2015! I know it'll focus on a different character but I'm really hoping we'll see more of some more of the characters mentioned in Raven.**Originally posted on Bookish Wanderlove.**"}, {"userName": "Kirsty (Amethyst Bookwyrm)", "userReviewDate": "Dec 02, 2014", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/7436809-kirsty-amethyst-bookwyrm", "userReview": "Thanks to Netgalley and AltWit Press for giving me this book to review.Raven was trained by her father to be a Reaper; a bodyguard/assassin, who believe that for every life they take, they have to save another.

It was a bit slow to start but really picked up after that and has lots of action and suspense in it. Raven is a very tough girl but also has her vulnerabilities which she worked though during the book. I really like Jack as he is loyal but also knows what is right and wrong, and I really liked that he did not try and prove he was a better fighter than Raven, which is unusual in most books. I also really liked Darius and I am glad he is not as spoiled as he could have been, however, I knew who Monroe was as soon as I met him.Even though the ending was a bit rushed, I really enjoyed this book and am looking forward to the next book about Darius.

Be as gentle as a dove but as cunning as a viper. Preserve one\u2019s self with intellect, and know when it is time to be either the dove or the viper.\u00a0Hell is yourself and the only redemption is when a person puts himself aside to feel deeply for another person. - Tennessee Williams\u00a0I like nonsense, it wakes up the brain cells. Fantasy is a necessary ingredient in living, it's a way of looking at life through the wrong end of a telescope. Which is what I do, and that enables you to laugh at life's realities. - Dr. Seuss\u00a0Here is an admission. As much as I have been interested and charmed by the concept of Steampunk, I have never read a book in the genre. Given the opportunity by the publisher to read Chronicles of Steele: Raven I can say that I am glad I waited. It is, in a word, delightful.\u00a0Raven Steele lives in a world of contradictions and extravagances of the surreal kind. Steam powered horses and mechanical humans live alongside flesh and blood beings. Dirigibles crowd the air while Victorian dress resides alongside leather and sword bearing private guards. Medical advances proceed alongside alchemy, and witchcraft is very real, in a sort of \u2018physics meets alchemy meets herbology\u2019 mashup. Sword and sorcery meets Victorian in an utterly enjoyable manner. The contradictions are charming and well written, a perfect introduction to a genre I was unfamiliar with.\u00a0Raven is a Reaper. Once the private (and very fatal) bodyguards and assassins to the Duke, they were disbanded when their leader, Raven\u2019s father, refused to murder the Duke\u2019s wife on his order. Hounded from the castle, his own men set upon him, her family flees, only to lose her mother to murder at the hands of the other Reapers. Trained by her father to be a Reaper in order to ascertain her safety from those who would murder her, Raven has travelled the lands, searching for redemption. A tenant of Reaper training, redemption is given through giving back a life for every life taken \u2013 and Raven\u2019s balance sheet is nearly complete.\u00a0But freedom and real life are jerked from her grasp when she rescues the young Baron of New Hope, Darius. The child is handed over to Raven by his elder brother, Baron Solomon Goodhope, who entreats her to save the child from his murderous father. The evil Duke means the boy to die for supposedly being infested by a demon. But the story is much more, and much less, than the Duke believes. And when he sets his guards on Raven and Darius\u2019s trail the consequences will be deeper than he could ever have expected.\u00a0Friends will become enemies and enemies possible friends as Raven begins a desperate cross-country race, by dirigible and train, horse and on foot, first to find the Witch she has been tasked to locate to cure the child, and then to save him once again from those who would murder him. Those who should by all rights keep him safe, but will kill in the name of the Duke, no matter how insane the order may be.\u00a0His conscience could not agree with what he was about to do. But orders were orders. And as captain of the guard, Jack always followed them to the letter. \u00a0Honor is found in the oddest places \u2013 but the boundless knee-jerk bone-headedness of mindless adherence to command structures and orders, even when deeply twisted and evil, is readily apparent. As well as a type of debilitating naivety on the part of people who should know better. But there is also a smile around every corner at the unexpected, the quaint, and the captivating. All of these things make the story appealing on so many different levels. Not only that, but there is an undercurrent here, another story line lying just below the surface which makes me eager for the next installment to the series!\u00a0While all these things are wonderful, there is one thing that bothered me. It may seem a small thing, but to me it is important to the presentation of the book. I was completely discombobulated by the cover. It presents as the cover for a Shamanistic Fantasy novel more than anything else. It is gorgeous, without a doubt, but it has absolutely no continuity with the story line. It is disconcerting to say the least. Without looking at the blurb I automatically expected the book to be on par with Patricia Briggs\u2019s Mercy Thompson series, or possibly Ilona Andrews\u2019s Kate Daniels series. Not for a true Steampunk novel. But again, it is a small thing that will possibly be of no interest to other readers.\u00a0I highly recommend this book for its strong heroine, well written story, and (yes, here is that word again) charming world building. Oh, and I was surprised to find that this is listed as \"young adult\" - but not in a bad way. It is a great story for young and young at heart. I will be watching anxiously for Darius\u2019s story, the next in the Chronicles of Steele. And I will definitely be checking out others in the genre. I am hooked!\u00a0I received Chronicles of Steele: Raven from the publisher in return for a realistic review.

When I first picked up Raven, I was sure I was going to adore it; I immediately fell in love with the protagonist. But things got iffy plotwise later on.Raven is an amazing main character. She's a steampunk ninja--well, technically, she's a reaper, but steampunk ninja is basically the same thing. She's noble and tries not to kill any of her enemies if she doesn't have to, but yet she still manages to dominate in every single fight. Not only that...she's great with kids. Wonderful, in fact. Basically, she's the type of heroine you will cheer out loud for while staring at your kindle even if there are other people in the room. But, like the best characters, Raven has some issues. She has a tragic backstory. And I felt some pain in my heart when I read about her and the love of her youth. The good pain, though, that makes you want to keep reading and hug the character.The young Baron Darius was so cute! He really acted like a little kid is supposed to act, yet he was never a brat and he was always really sweet. I loved how he and Raven interacted; she was so good with him, and he was adorable. Now, here's where I get to be my usual criticizing self. The plot started off great; lots of Raven showing up a bunch of palace guards, lots of cute moments with Darius, no real romance...but then as soon as the wood witch rolled around everything went south. It was still readable, but I didn't get as many touching scenes...and I instead got Jack Grant.Jack Grant...you are not the great character I assumed you to be. You are pretty unremarkable, and you came in with the predictable romance and...bleh. I can't ship you and Raven; she is better off without you in my opinion. I mean, in the beginning, did you not try to kill her? That's not cool. Plus, I had to endure your POV a couple times, and I just wanted to get back to my wonderful Raven. The plot also was less straight forward as time went on; which, 99.99% of the time is a good thing. But I felt like it went in a complete 180 degree turn from where it started out, which was kind of hard to transition from. Still, as this is a steampunk novel, I still enjoyed some aspects of the plot, because they were just so, well, steampunky. The automatons, Darius' strange affliction...these are things you can only really get from a steampunk novel, and I loved them. So the plot didn't totally disappoint me. It was a good story, though the beginning was better, and the romance made things slightly less awesome than the beginning. But if you like steampunk Raven is a pretty solid read."}, {"userName": "Olivia-Savannah  Roach", "userReviewDate": "Jan 06, 2015", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/34117027-olivia-savannah-roach", "userReview": "This review can originally be found on Olivia's Catastrophe: http://olivia-savannah.blogspot.nl/20...*Thank you to ebooks4review for the review copy*This was my first steampunk novel. Ever since hearing about the genre I knew it was going to be one I liked. And of course, in this novel I did as well!This book was about reapers. People who kill others as part of their job. But for every life they take, they need to save another to stay in balance with themselves and not lose who they are. I haven\u2019t read many books that include reapers in them at all yet, and I will say that this was a very unique way to portray them. They weren\u2019t exactly anything but human \u2013 but their training almost seems to set them apart from the humans completely. I loved it!The novel wasn\u2019t slow paced, but there were an awful lot of details in there. In fact, as I was reading in some cases I wished the novel was a little shorter so that I wouldn\u2019t feel like I was reading so many pointless details. But the romance was a slow and steady one, and that I loved! No insta-love, no silly love triangles. Just Raven trying to do her job and being a little bit distracted by a certain person who is sent to stop her from doing her job. Yes, perfect timing to fall in love. What\u2019s best about it though is that Raven doesn\u2019t even recognise the feelings she feels throughout the novel. All she wants to do was to be focused on her task. I loved her determination, her edge and how she was caring as well. Raven was an ideal character to me. She was feminine, but independent. I liked the steampunk in this. It was used well. At the beginning some steampunk-ish words were thrown my way which I obviously didn\u2019t recognise because I haven\u2019t tried books like this before. I got confused by the wording because there aren\u2019t really any explanations, but soon enough you understand. It just took a little time, and a few pages.I also really loved Grant\u2019s character. Grant and Colton were the perfect gentlemen throughout this when they were being themselves. I know lots of readers fall for the bad boys or whatever, but I would have a gentleman instead any day\u2026The plot here was decent. There were enough twists to keep me eagerly reading. I liked how the alliances and who and was and wasn\u2019t an enemy shifted at times. It always made me curious who Raven could trust and who she couldn\u2019t.The ending to the book was good, but I wanted a bit more closure! Especially on the romance part *pouts* But alas, there is going to be a book two! I look forward to reading that and seeing the story from Darius\u2019s point of view in the future."}, {"userName": "BookLoversLife", "userReviewDate": "Sep 17, 2014", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/4020075-bookloverslife", "userReview": "Raven is a reaper, not the dead kind but one who assassinates people, and lives by the reaper code.

She jumps out of the way but she can see that theyoung boy in the carriage will not survive if she doesn't help him. She leaps to action and manages to save the boy, Darius.In thanks for saving the boy, the Baron of New Haven pleads with her to take Darius to somewhere safe before he is killed. People think Darius is possessed because every so often he has fits, and during the fit things explode around him. He was taken to the Bishop to be exorcised but it didn't work and now he will be killed. Raven has no choice but to agree because if she saves this boys life again then she will be even. But just when Raven thinks her life is settling down, she is thrown back into the world she wants to leave. I loved this book!! I haven't read many steampunk but what I have read I've enjoyed and this is no different!Raven was kick ass!! Her father didn't want her to become a reaper but after her mother was killed he agreed to train her. She is at the stage in her life now where she just wants to settle down and maybe have a family with her first love but is drawn back into life on the run. I loved her character!! She is so tough but so kind as well. She really takes Darius into her heart and will do anything for him. All the characters are extremely well written.

As possibly the only female reaper, Raven is totally bad-ass! She is smart, stubborn, knows how to rock a corset and uses her weapons (or even someone else\u2019s!) skilfully. Raven does not take her profession lightly but when we meet her she is considering giving it all up to settle down and become a wife. This is until she saves Baron Darius and begins perhaps the most dangerous assignment of her life.Although Raven is still a reaper at heart, in becoming Darius\u2019 protector she now puts his needs before her own and risks her health to keep him safe. Pauline Creeden chooses to evolve the relationship between Raven and Darius like a romance. Initially, they are shy and uncomfortable in each other\u2019s presence but they seek reassurance, especially after the first attack on them and Raven\u2019s discovery that the love of her life is now married. As they continue their journey, Darius is scared and Raven is broken-hearted but they manage to bring out the best qualities in each other. Darius begins to act like a \u2018normal\u2019 boy and a softer side of Raven emerges.This story is a rich and exciting steampunk fantasy, made sharper by Pauline Creeden\u2019s descriptions of people, places and events which invite the reader to use all of their senses and enter Raven\u2019s world,\u201d Snow pelted raven\u2019s face. Like icicles, the flakes stuck to her eyelashes, but she trudged on through the knee-deep snow. She ignored the burning sensation in her exposed skin while the wind blew at her back. Wisps of her hair pulled free from her bun and lashed about her face. The snow glowed seemingly of its own accord, lighting the winding mountain trail.\u201dPauline Creeden develops the relationship between Jack Grant and Raven in such a way that we expect a romantic side-plot but there is only a small hint of love, which I think makes the story all the more unique.Volume One of The Chronicles of Steele covers a variety of genres, meaning that it has a greater appeal to a range of readers. It would be a great book for someone in a \u2018slump\u2019 who is looking for a different and exciting story."}, {"userName": "Lindsay", "userReviewDate": "Nov 08, 2014", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/4337141-lindsay", "userReview": "I read Raven as a serial, which did two things for me.1) Kept me wanting more.2) Kept me from devouring it all in one sitting, so I was able to agonize linger over the characters and story for a longer period of time.This is, by far, my favorite book of Pauline\u2019s so far. I\u2019ve said it time and again, that Steampunk is not a genre that every author can pull off. It\u2019s not just a matter of creating believable characters (which is a hard enough task on its own!) but it\u2019s also building a whole new world complete with outrageous mechanics, and making it scientifically believable. Then throw in some historical fiction to the mix and call it a day! Pauline manages to present it with perfection.Raven, herself, is one of my favorite reasons to recommend this book, especially to female readers. She is one of the strongest female protagonists that you will find, pushing through the hardest of times and the most painful of injuries. What makes her character so much stronger, is knowing the historical significance. Women didn\u2019t wear pants. They didn\u2019t speak their minds, and they most certainly did not fight back. Women were not a threat. Raven is fierce, and I would like to believe that she is an ideal role model for girls and women of all ages.Raven is a book that will stick with me for years to come. Now that it\u2019s over, the only thing that brings me comfort is knowing that there are sequels in the works. I will kick and scream wait patiently and politely, and I will most certainly not harass Pauline constantly to give me hints about what\u2019s to come.

As with every book I\u2019ve read by Pauline Creeden so far, it only took a matter of moments for me to fall in deep. I have to say that Raven is my favorite work by Pauline to date. Steampunk rocks my socks off, and I have a major soft spot for reapers, but this story completely blew me away. I\u2019m so glad I was able to read this in one setting instead of having to wait for each episode \u2014 although that can be fun, too.One of my favorite aspects of this story is the spin on reapers. To be completely honest, I was expecting something entirely different going in, but I certainly wasn\u2019t disappointed when I learned otherwise. For every life taken, one must be saved. Damn, that\u2019s powerful. And not only is it an interesting part of the story, it\u2019s full of purpose. That single rule adds an incredible amount of depth to Raven and Darius\u2019 storyline. Why didn\u2019t I think of writing something like this? Ha!Raven is a strong female lead, which makes me a happy reader. I\u2019m not a huge fan of books that force a badass female character. In this story, it\u2019s totally believable. Raven is fierce in more ways than one. In ways that truly have meaning.I have to admit, my mind tends to wander\u2026 squirrel!\u2026 when there is a lot of detail in a story, but I enjoyed each and every golden nugget. I didn\u2019t skim at all. Not so much as a paragraph! The world-building is so incredibly spot on, I was there.

Take the boy to the Witch and protect him from his own father.I don\u2019t have any other words for this book other than I simply loved it. It mixes steampunk and fantasy together perfectly. I loved the idea of the reaper. At first I thought Raven\u2019s dad was the Grim Reaper, but it makes so much sense and it\u2019s such a fun use of the word. If you haven\u2019t already gathered this, reapers are assassins, but they are assassins who live by a code. You kill to get the job done, but you must save a life for every life you\u2019ve killed. As time went on, reapers have become an extinct group with assassins choosing to kill just for the thrill of it with no compensation. Raven is among the last who still uphold the moral code.I\u2019ll be honest and say that character wise, none of them particularly stick out to me. I really like Raven, but kickbutt-wise she wasn\u2019t the toughest I\u2019ve read about. That didn\u2019t stop her from completely capturing my emotions and keeping me hooked throughout the story. It frustrated me so much how there was a hint of romance but it wasn\u2019t anything else but a hint. I wanted Raven to be happy and find someone to care for her and give her that peaceful cottage life she\u2019s always dreamed of having.I loved Monroe who was the other reaper we got to meet. He was an amazing father figure for Raven which is something she needed throughout the book. Raven\u2019s relationship with Darius is sweet and pulls at your heartstrings. He\u2019s such an innocent boy with a special gift that has his father wanting him dead. It\u2019s a cruel world, but he manages to see the light in everything. Last character is mention of Captain Jack Grant. I liked him and desperately wanted him to do something about his feelings for Raven. They would certainly make a great couple and fighting team. One thing that did bother me was how he just a lot on Raven\u2019s strength and spirit as his main reason of being enthralled by her. It does go on to mention her personality, but for a good majority of the book he mentions her fighting skill which makes her seem more like a good fighter than someone he\u2019s interested in.This is getting a bit a long, but I have two more things to cover and one\u2019s the mixture of steampunk and fantasy. I mentioned the fantasy aspect a bit with the reapers but did I mention that there are also witches and steam powered servants and horses? Darius has this ability to completely blow apart any automaton that he comes into close contact with. Thus, his father wants him dead because automatons are pretty important in society. Darius\u2019s brother begs Raven to help bring Darius to a witch to cure him of his disease. But the witch turns out to be a bit more\u2026wicked.Last thing I promise! My biggest problem with the book. It\u2019s not that big of a deal, but compared to how invested I was in the book, I felt like it was a big deal. The ending seemed a bit abrupt and rushed. There is one particular scene where things go boom that I\u2019m targeting at and all of a sudden the biggest threat is just not there anymore and replaced by a bigger threat. Then that threat is eliminated and everything\u2019s happy. Until Raven leaves because she can\u2019t face being happy as she believes she doesn\u2019t deserve it. There seem to be a trend lately with the books I\u2019ve been reading where the ending leaves me feeling extremely unsatisfied. Maybe you feel differently, but I wanted that one extra page conclusion and my life would have been complete. I guess I\u2019ll have to wait for Volume Two to be released\u2026Overall, can you tell I really liked this book? Highly recommend for fans for steampunk because this is pretty freaking awesome!

She was trained by her father to be a reaper. I don't remember the book actually giving a definition of what a reaper is, but from the information given, I understood it to be a type of guardian. The reapers have fighting and survival skills way beyond that of the average person. I believe traditionally they were suppose to be protectors to the people. Also reapers are suppose to follow a code in order to try to maintain a balance. If they take a life, they must save a life. Raven still lives by the code, but many of her fellow reapers have become mercenaries to the wealthy royal families.\n\"It's a state of mind. Some people loathe the act of killing a person at first, but as they continue to do it, it can feel like a game. They can begin to feel superior, like the winner of the game. But, if the reaper has to save a life for every life they take, it keeps them humble. It's a matter of subservience so the reaper doesn't begin to think himself as stronger than he is.\"\nSeveral of the characters in the story are corrupt, not just the reapers. There are the royals and their lies. Also the book contains witches. There is a correlation in the writing in that the characters who wholly give in to power have negative effects. One example is when the witch uses magic, she ages.\n\"Magic comes at a cost most are unwilling to pay.\"\nThe actual storyline is about a boy from the royal family who is set to be killed. Raven's mission is to keep him alive. The plot follows them through all their trials. They're hunted while on the run and come across automatons, huge spiders, solders and much more.I believe this is the perfect story for the intended younger audience.3.5 stars \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n    ***Copy given in exchange for an honest review***\n  \n\n\n\n\n      toni\n    \n\n\n\n\nFangirlMoments and My Two Cents\n\n\n\nFULL REVIEW CAN BE FOUND AT http://fangirlmomentsandmytwocents.bl..."}, {"userName": "Carrie", "userReviewDate": "Dec 21, 2014", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/10425337-carrie", "userReview": "*Received a copy via netgalley for an honest review.*When I first saw Chronicles of Steele: Raven available for request on Netgalley I don't think I made it past the word 'steampunk' before I started bouncing like a little girl on Christmas morning. I love the steampunk genre, if its done well that is and so often it is poorly handled. Enter Raven, a Reaper who simply wants the find balance between her killings and those she needed to save so she could quit and marry the love of her life. But when a carriage careened out of control, her instincts took over and she rushed to the rescue. From there her plans took an unexpected turn, and the story exploded. Most of the steampunk books I've read had some sort of paranormal aspect to them, so I wasn't too surprised when witches were tossed into the mix. But something about the world felt different from the others. Sure their were nobles and peasants, mechanical horses and alchemists, but we were not in England. Even though we were told the names of places, it took a few chapters for that to really settle in. As the story continued, I was tugged into a world that was both steampunk AND fantasy. The combination was captivating and spurred me to read faster.Raven was an interesting character. There was no question she could take care of herself, we saw evidence of her skills very early on. -Can I have her bow and speed please?- But her strength wasn't just physical, she was capable, and more than willing to take charge of her life. She was smart and resourceful, you couldn't help but to admire her. At the same time, she had this air of naivety about her. She may be capable of interacting with others, but living a life on the run allowed only a couple people in her life to see the girl underneath all the black clothes and assortment of weapons.I liked the way the romance in this story played out. They were aware of the other from the start but it wasn't like a instalove attraction-til-death-do-us-part sort of thing. It fit within the structure of the story. You knew it was happening and you saw the characters change as the story progressed, but this was not one of those romances where the mushy bits came first and the plot second. Our heroes focused on what they needed to be focused on. Words To Live By\"Defeat is a state of mind. The loser is not a person who fails, but one who gives up. If one never gives up, lost ground can be easily recovered when the opportunity presents itself. But if one's head hangs in shame, only the person's feet can be seen.\" \"Know in whom one can trust, and in whom one cannot. Expose wounds to one for healing; hide them from the other or die.\" \"There are times when no matter how hard you want to redeem yourself for your wrongs, you just can't do enough. You can't pay enough.\" OverallIf you like steampunk, or even fantasy novels with a bit of a twist, then you may enjoy this one. The characters were interesting, and the world was fascinating. At the end of the book, there was a bit about the next book in the series coming out, so that's something I am going to keep my eye on."}, {"userName": "Becky Stephens", "userReviewDate": "Sep 17, 2014", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/24779079-becky-stephens", "userReview": "I originally read Raven as a serial, and each time I got to the end, I couldn't wait to read the next one!First, let me mention the cover art. It's gorgeous, and perfectly complements this well written steampunk fantasy. Plus, the interior formatting is as much a work of art as the cover is.Raven Steele, trained as a reaper, resides in a fantastic world of steam-powered horses and other gadgets. Reapers were part of the duke's elite guard, working in the capacity of bodyguards and assassins. But, to keep the reapers humble, they were required to save a life for every one they took as an assassin.The adventure begins when an out-of control horse carrying a young boy, careens off of a bridge. In the right place at the right time, Raven doesn't hesitate to save the boy's life, whom she later learns is a baron. With a curse upon him, Raven takes on the challenge to protect him and find a way to lift the curse. We follow Raven on her journey to protect young Darius.Pauline crafted wonderful three-dimensional characters. I feel as if I've known Raven her entire life, and watching her speed and dexterity makes me feel like a proud mama. I enjoy seeing Darius' personality emerge as he learns to trust Raven, and I feel just as protective of him as Raven does. One of the things I love about this story is Raven's relationship with Darius. She truly cares of him, and not just as a life to redeem for one she has taken as a reaper.And what can I say about Captain Grant? He recognizes that Raven's \"passion was like a storm, and he could either cower from the lightning, or be brave and stand in the rain.\" I'd say Grant isn't the type to ever cower.I admire Pauline's ability to blend steampunk and fantasy so flawlessly. The world she created feels real. It speaks to her abilities and creativeness, and I will no doubt be a lifelong fan. Raven is exceptionally well written (and edited), and filled with adventure and action at just the right pace.One of my favorite things about Raven is the lesson at the beginning of each chapter. Each one is beautifully written, like a poem.With a reaper redeeming the lives she has taken, mechanical horses and men, witchcraft, and so many unexpected twists, this steampunk fantasy is so much fun! I highly recommend it to all fans of fantasy and steampunk, or just a butt-kicking heroine."}, {"userName": "Grace Fonseca", "userReviewDate": "Jan 11, 2015", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/2797624-grace-fonseca", "userReview": "A surprisingly very good novel that is told in four parts. I really liked the idea of a young woman being a reaper, someone who takes lives, but has to redeem those lives she has taken by saving lives. Plus there were a lot of interesting things that happen in the book.One of the most interesting things that happens for me personally is how she tries to save a young boy, and all of a sudden there becomes a sense of urgency to help this boy. He is very important because he is royalty, sort of being the second son, but his abilities make mechanical things go a little haywire. So Raven agrees to protect the boy not realizing how she starts to care about him. She also meets old friends, enemies and makes some new ones.This book had a crazy amount of action. I felt at times like I was watching an intense action movie. Raven certainly is a very capable heroine. She does have a lot of intense emotions. Plus we get a lot of flashbacks as what has happened to her in the past. This makes us the readers feel like she is someone that we can relate to. I really like this background that the author gives us. Plus the boy is someone who is kind of curious and he kinds of reminds Raven of what she could have, but sometimes that is not how life worked out.The action was non-stop as their were a lot of crazy twists in this book. I totally love how the minor characters help Raven in unexpected ways. Plus when the Wood Witch takes the boy, other things happen that she never expects. She also learns that not every man is going to abandon her. Raven is afraid to open her heart, but finds that she does love a certain man she never expected to. This comes to her as a surprise and something that she fears. She never thought that it would be someone who was originally chasing her.The fight with the Wood Witch was intense and so unbelievably good. It was like watching a heavy weight fight. Such a great battle to behold. I really enjoyed how Raven figured out how to beat her by using her wit and then her strength.This was a good book and I really would like to read the next book in this series when it comes out.Rating: Four Hearts"}, {"userName": "Jennifer  Ricketts (Donnie Darko Girl)", "userReviewDate": "Jan 11, 2015", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/6097206-jennifer-ricketts-donnie-darko-girl", "userReview": "I received a review copy for my stop on the blog tour at Donnie Darko Girl. I'm a fan of serial storytelling where parts of the story come in episodes spread out over time. The Chronicles of Steele #1 contains four episodes, and I'll be reviewing all of them here. I really enjoyed reading the episodes and even better, I read them back-to-back. It would have been difficult to wait for each one, but I wouldn't have minded. My anticipation would have just built up, and all of this together means the wait would be worth it. After finishing The Chronicles of Steele, I know this is definitely true. I love Raven. She's a reaper who wants to settle down and become a wife but an incident early on ends up sending her on yet another mission. Once she's on this mission, that's all she focuses on though she had been on her way to give up being a reaper and live a \"normal\" human life. Reapers aren't magic, but they are highly trained to anticipate outcomes ahead of time and to fight and to be mentally prepared. They are so well trained they seem like they use magic. Raven was taught to save a life for every life she has to take, which keeps a reaper balanced and reminds him (with the exception of Raven, most reapers are male) all lives have meaning. The plot is captivating and laid out well, and the steampunk elements are seamlessly blended in giving the world Creeden has built vibrant life. Captain Jack caught my eye early on. I remember thinking I hoped to meet up with him again sooner rather than later. Though he's the enemy, it isn't quite that cut and dry as you'll find out. Jack and Raven are playing a game of cat-and-mouse. She's always one step ahead of him, and I couldn't help but be amused every time he realized that. He sees her strength and recognizes her vulnerability. There's more to him than just what you see on the outside. I think The Chronicles of Steele might just be my absolute favorite book by Pauline Creeden now - it's that fantastic!"}, {"userName": "Jillyn", "userReviewDate": "Sep 16, 2014", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/5818960-jillyn", "userReview": "I'll let you all in on a secret: I love steampunk novels. But, because I love them so much, I tend to be a little bit more picky with this genre than other ones that I read, so I rarely get a steampunk book that I truly enjoy. I'm happy to say that Raven, while not a perfect score for me, was definitely an enjoyable read overall.I really enjoyed the writing detail of all of the characters involved. Characters make or break a book for me, and in this book, even the characters that you are going to hate (and you will) are at the very least well written. I liked that Raven was a strong and independent character without being harsh about it in the process (a personal trend I've been seeing lately in young adult books, but I digress). She might be tough but she has a different, more approachable side to her as well, and I liked that.The pacing of this book is on point, and makes for a book that's easy to complete in one sitting. I didn't read this book in its original serial novella form, but I can totally see where if I didn't have the complete story in front of me, I'd be left clamoring for more. There is a lot of action and hardly a dull moment in this book, which I always love.The world-building was also pretty detailed and it was easy to get lost in this steampunk world that Creeden has created for her characters. My only real complaint is that sometimes it felt like aspects of this world were added just for the sake of making it steampunk-ier, which was a bit of an annoyance but not anything that hindered my reading too much.I think this is a book young adult fans of steampunk will really enjoy, and if you haven't read a steampunk book before, this one is a great book to introduce you to the genre.

Reading this book was such a wonderful experience I found myself reading it very slowly just so I could fully savor every moment.
