Charity Jones' life was not at all normal. At 16, she's bullied by many people at her school for many reasons. A young boy, Adrian is brought by her parents to their home to stay with them. Charity is pretty upset about it but soon she accepts him and finally falls for him.But everything's going to be messed up quite soon and you have to be ready to see the tables turn. To see less unexpected from YA novels. You have to hole your breath and let Snowed show you all its trickery. Intelligent characters are always a fun to watch. This book gives the perfect blend for that.The cover is somewhat mysterious but don't let it fool you. Inside it, this contains a plenty of things to let you have an adventurous ride. The best thing about the book apart from the plot line, is the characters. All powerful to the point of intimidating you!Writing style is what I seek in a young adult novel. Full of enthusiasm and curiosity. A plethora of action, romance, humor and fighting with enemies are some treats that ask me to root for this book. The author's style is promising and I would like to read more of her future works."}, {"userName": "Mogsy (MMOGC)", "userReviewDate": "Dec 20, 2016", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/4379514-mogsy-mmogc", "userReview": "3 of 5 stars at The BiblioSanctum https://bibliosanctum.com/2016/12/24/...Snowed is a story about Christmas, but it is definitely not like your usual schmaltzy Christmas book. It stars Charity Jones, a sixteen-year-old biracial student with a natural talent for all things science and engineering. At her high school in a conservative county of California though, this only gets her mercilessly bullied because she is different. Thankfully, for Charity there\u2019s one bright spot in this bleak situation: Aidan, the sweet mild-mannered teen runaway whom her family takes in as a foster child. No one know where Aidan came from, but it is clear that he is running away from something\u2014something terrible.Still, despite his reluctance to share much about his past, Aidan and Charity wind up hitting it off and they quickly fall in love. Things actually start looking up for Charity, but of course this respite doesn\u2019t last. The community is shaken one day, when the body of Charity\u2019s worst bully is found behind the bleachers, savaged and torn apart. The authorities are quick to suspect a wild animal attack, but Charity isn\u2019t so sure. After all, unbeknownst to the rest of the school, she was actually the first one to find the victim, and there was something strange she saw at the scene\u2026First, I want to go into the positives of this book, and there are certainly many. Number one is diversity. Kudos to the author for doing her best to include perspectives from all walks of life, even though her approach can be pretty heavy-handed at times, almost like she was making sure to check off all the boxes on a #diversereads checklist. Having main characters that reflect and honor the lives of all people is always wonderful though, and something to be celebrated especially in the young adult genre.I also liked how Snowed was a Christmas story for those who might be looking for something other than the usual feel-good and campy holiday-themed books that flood the market around this time of the year. Personally, I love the festive atmosphere around Christmastime, but hey, it\u2019s also okay to have a \u201cbah humbug\u201d moment every now and then. If you ever feel the need to take break from the holiday madness and the constant barrage of holiday-themed music and TV hitting you from all directions, then this book is the answer. Forget the warm and fuzzy feelings, because this is one dark book that likely won\u2019t be filling you with the holiday cheer by the time it\u2019s over. On the other hand, how cool is it that we get a story that explores Krampus lore and presents a darker, more sinister side to the figure of Santa Claus?And now for the things that didn\u2019t work so well for me. The big one was the extreme-to-the-point-of-contrived stereotypes. All the horrible people at school bullying Charity are of course the jock and cheerleader types, all of them white, bible-thumping and gun-happy ignorant rednecks according to our protagonist. The irony is that Charity frequently comes off as even more judgmental and patronizing as the people she rails against. There are also very few responsible and admirable adult characters, which is a pet peeve of mine when it comes to YA. Charity and her friends paint the police as a bunch of incompetent meatheads, while Charity\u2019s parents are portrayed as a couple of dopes in denial, helpless in stopping her deranged psychopath of a brother hurt her and everyone she loves. The teachers are also apparently too busy planning their own holidays (or worrying about new charter schools opening in their county, threatening their precious hegemony) that they can\u2019t be bothered to do anything about serious problems like bullying and death threats to their students.In fact, the narrative tries very hard to make you think that Charity and her little \u201cenlightened\u201d group are the only ones capable of getting anything done. Not only was this unrealistic, it just made Charity and all her friends intensely unlikable. Furthermore, Charity also can\u2019t help but remind readers every other chapter that she\u2019s into science, robotics and technology (yet apparently not computer savvy enough to prevent her own email account from getting hacked). I agree we need to encourage girls and young women to enter and succeed in the STEM fields, but there\u2019s no subtlety at all in the way the author is trying to prop up her protagonist as a poster child for the cause.Finally, I didn\u2019t like the romance. In my opinion, the instalove and Charity\u2019s dramatics actually undermined a lot of what the story was trying to achieve, removing some of Aidan\u2019s mystique. After knowing him for little more than a week, Charity professes to love Aidan so much that she can\u2019t live without him, that she \u201cdies every minute\u201d they\u2019re not together, or that losing him would be like the worst thing that\u2019s ever happened to her (even worse than when Grandma Jones passed away!) In retrospect, the overwrought and sentimental adolescent language probably didn\u2019t help either.That said, overall I had a good time with Snowed. Ultimately it\u2019s a book with some great ideas but which might be lacking in polish when it comes to execution, though it\u2019s nonetheless impressive especially since we\u2019re talking about a book from a small indie publishing house. Admittedly the story could have been streamlined to bring the horror aspects and Krampus plotline to the forefront while toning down the exposition and romance, but I also have to give it credit for its diverse cast of main characters and the fact that it also explores difficult topics, including a few that don\u2019t get talked about much, like the emotional struggles that families of incarcerated teens go through (and I actually wish this had been given more attention in the book). All told, an interesting read that offers something a little different for the holidays."}, {"userName": "Barb (Boxermommyreads)", "userReviewDate": "Dec 05, 2016", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/5549264-barb-boxermommyreads", "userReview": "After quite a bit of thinking, I'm giving this book 4/5 instead of 3/5 because even though there were parts of it that really bothered me (more coming up on that soon), I have to give credit for it being a very diverse, horror-filled Christmas tale. Charity Jones is a 16 year old attending school in California. Her mother is an attorney/social worker, her father, a weapons engineer, and her brother, a punk. Charity has an eclectic group of friends and she herself is bi-racial. One day she comes home from a particularly hard day at school to find her mom has brought home a stray foster child - a dashing, yet odd and backward, Aidan. Little is known about Aidan other than his father is a very dangerous man and is out to locate him and bring him back home. Suddenly a bully at Charity's school is brutally murdered and Charity and her friends find themselves right in the middle of this zany and sometimes terrifying Christmas caper.First, let's look at the things I liked about this book. Somewhere within the past two years I've become obsessed with Krampus. Perhaps it's because Halloween and Christmas run neck-and-neck for my favorite holiday and Krampus kind of combines them both. Needless to say, this book takes the Krampus legend and greatly expounds on it. Secondly, the diversity in this book is great. We have geeks and nerds, Asians, bi-racial families and LGBT characters. Friendship really is at the root of this book and it's great to see such a wide variety of individuals. Finally, the book is fast-paced. You run into villains and heroes every time you turn around and for a while, you are trying to figure out who is who.Now on to what drove me crazy. INSTA-LOVE. I know this is a young adult book and I guess some writers feel there has to be a love element to keep teens interested. Personally I don't think that is the case but either way, Charity and Aidan are madly in love before the reader is about 40% into the book. Now while the relationship between them drives a lot of the other things that happen in the book, I found it annoying nonetheless. Also, although I applaud the diversity in this book, I almost feel like at times it's thrown in the reader's face. Almost like there was a checklist of races and cultures which the author wanted to mention and as she was writing, she mentally checked them off. Overall, I'm glad I read \"Snowed.\" As I mentioned, there just aren't a lot of decent horror/fantasy Christmas reads and this one definitely fits that bill. If you are interested in that type of read, I would recommend picking this up. However, if you really can't stand insta-love, then this is probably not the book for you and you'll have to decide if the good I mentioned outweigh it enough for you to give it a chance."}, {"userName": "Rowena Lundquist", "userReviewDate": "Oct 13, 2016", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/34950795-rowena-lundquist", "userReview": "Maria Alexander has written a top-notch YA novel. The book's heroine, Charity Jones, is an intrepid, fierce 16-year-old who, at the beginning of the tale, is coping with an increasingly troubled family life and prejudicial backlash at school because of her skepticism about God. Although the story seems a bit emphatic in a vague, anti-christian way, the message is quickly dropped as it develops from a teen-angst tale into a taut monster mystery. The story is smart and polished. It takes a popular myth and blends it with its less savory origins, then plops the whole thing down into the middle of Smalltown U.S.A. \"Snowed\" is a Christmas story that fuses adventure with soft horror in a way that reminds one of the movie \"Gremlins\". Extremely readable, Alexander's writing promises some great novels to come for young adult readers who like gothic, fantasy and soft horror."}, {"userName": "J.L.", "userReviewDate": "Nov 01, 2016", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/5757531-j-l", "userReview": "Disclaimer: The author and I share a publisher, and I helped proofread this novel before publication.If I had not been reading this novel on an expensive electronic device, I\u2019d have thrown it across the room when I got to the ending. But not because it was a bad book. On the contrary, this book was such a fun adventure that the cliffhanger ending made me want to lose my mind. I did, however, accost the author to find out whether a sequel was forthcoming. Good news! One is definitely in the works.Because of the way schedules work in the publishing world, I read Snowed during the heat of summer. However, Alexander\u2019s words transported me to the holiday season with little effort. I follow the author on social media, so I was spoiled a bit for this novel based on hints she\u2019d provided on research she did for this story. But rather than being any sort of let-down, any predictions that I made and the big reveals in the book were a ton of fun to reach.One of my favorite things about this book was the nontraditional setting. Most \u201cCalifornia\u201d books take place in such locales as hip San Francisco or sunny Los Angeles, familiar from so much of popular culture. Temperate, conservative northern California is a departure from the norm. But what I appreciate the most is that Alexander doesn\u2019t set the novel here just for something different. The setting becomes a character in itself regarding both the winter weather and the mindset of the people around the main character, Charity Jones. Points should also be given for a diverse main character, because once again, there\u2019s no feeling that the author made this decision just to be different. Charity\u2019s entire character has been shaped by this aspect of her being, but it always comes off as realistic rather than an insertion of authorial voice.As a point of view character, Charity drew me in immediately. One of the things I liked best about her was that she was the hero of her own story but still maintained some flaws that made her a realistic character. She gets a little preachy about things she\u2019s passionate about, but it\u2019s a good example of what makes her a whole person rather than a plastic, predictable YA fantasy heroine.At times, the text message conversations between characters felt a little contrived or clich\u00e9 because of the abbreviated language used. However, I may have felt this way due to my limited experience with or exposure to the young adult genre, and with teenagers in general. More importantly, the friendships and other relationships between the teenage characters rang very true, and included depth not often attributed to characters who are not yet adults.Overall, this was a great fantasy novel that features a villain not often explored in speculative fiction, either adult or YA. The modern ways in which the villain is fought are imaginative and delightfully unexpected."}, {"userName": "Diana", "userReviewDate": "Nov 23, 2016", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/10479935-diana", "userReview": "I just couldn't.

This has in no way influenced my review.*No preamble, I'm just going to jump right into this review with some lists.Things I Liked:- It was a Christmas-themed fantasy. There aren't a lot of those.- It had a unique and dark take on the legends of Santa and Krampus.Things I Disliked:- Stereotypes galore. The jocks were stupid and mean. The artsy girl had purple hair. The band geeks and smart people played D&D. You get the drift.- Charity was one of the most unlikable protagonists I've ever read about. She kept talking about how judgmental and prejudiced all the other people were, but she was just as judgmental and prejudiced, only about different things. She said people who believe in God are gullible. She lumped every athletic person, except Ricardo, together and just constantly insulted and stereotyped them. She didn't want to be seen with Aidan in the beginning because she thought he was weird. At first I thought maybe she was made unlikable on purpose so that she could grow over the course of the book, but, other than her opinion toward Aidan, she didn't seem to change.- I'm all for diversity in books, so it was great that Charity was atheist and biracial, but it was like the author wanted to make sure no one ever forgot those things for even 60 seconds. For example, any time the word God or Devil or Heaven or Hell was mentioned, even in a casual way in common phrases, anytime Charity happened to see someone praying or hear someone mention prayer, etc., she made sure to remind the reader yet again how she didn't believe in those things. It doesn't matter what religion or non-religion or ethnicity or anything the character is, I'm happy to read about it as it pertains to the story and affects the character, but I don't want forced reminders on every other page.- On a similar note, she was into engineering and science, which was also great, but the way it was written it was like all science all the time to the point that you would think she'd break out in hives if she were even in the same room as a colored pencil or anything related to any other type of interest. It just felt like another exaggerated stereotype.- Speaking of exaggerated, that also describes a lot of the characters' behaviors and things that happened.- Instalove. \"You mean more to me than my entire life and I would die for you\" within a week of meeting type instalove.So overall this was a great idea for a story involving the Santa and Krampus legends, and it was great that there was diversity, but the stereotypes, the exaggeration, and judgmental protagonist made it ultimately not work for me.Recommended For:Young adult readers looking for a darkish Christmas-themed fantasy book who don't mind the issues I pointed out in my review.\nOriginal Review @Metaphors and Moonlight"}, {"userName": "Maxine", "userReviewDate": "Dec 11, 2016", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/5208303-maxine", "userReview": "Sixteen-year-old Charity Jones is a genius. She is also the victim of bullies for her smarts, her weight, her biracial heritage, and her skepticism which doesn\u2019t play well in this small Conservative Christian town and school. After a particularly rough day, she is furious to discover that her liberal parents have brought a young seemingly homeless boy, Aiden, to move in with them. However, he quickly wins her trust and then her heart.Then she learns who his father is and why he has run away. And why they are all now in danger from someone just about everyone loves but who is not who they think he is. Aiden is his heir and he will destroy anyone who gets in his way or, perhaps, just for fun. Fortunately, he can only leave his home on one day of the year; unfortunately he has lots of minions willing to do the dirty work for him. And if they fail, well, that one day is fast approaching. Ho ho ho no!When I first saw Snowed by author Maria Alexander on Netgalley, I wasn\u2019t interested. The cover didn\u2019t grab me, I had never heard of the publisher Raw Dog Screaming Press (although, if this is typical of their offerings, I\u2019ll be looking to get more from them in the future), and I\u2019m not really much of a horror fan. Still, it was the time of year when I\u2019m looking for new and original Christmas tales to entertain me through the season and I decided what the heck, it\u2019s short so I\u2019ll give it a try.I started it at bedtime figuring if nothing else, it might put me to sleep. \u2013 Big mistake. All night, it was just one more chapter, one more page, one more paragraph. I finished it just as the sun was coming up. Turns out, Snowed is one heck of a page-turner with some great YA characters you will definitely want to root for or against and one very very evil villain. There\u2019s plenty of action, a bit of romance, teenaged angst, and even some humour to break up the tension.So if you\u2019ve already had it up to here with Christmas muzak at the mall, schmaltzy Christmas tv shows, just all around Christmas cheer, maybe what you need is some Christmas horror. On the downside, after immersing yourself in the story, the cliffhanger ending may seem like one giant humbug (but don\u2019t do anything to your ipad to get yourself on the naughty list because there is a sequel coming). Be warned, however, after reading Snowed, you may never look at Christmas or good ol\u2019 Saint Nick the same way again.Thanks to Netgalley and Raw Dog Screaming Press for the opportunity to read this book in exchange for an honest review"}, {"userName": "Elke", "userReviewDate": "Nov 13, 2016", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/1105232-elke", "userReview": "I didn't know that much about this book when I started reading, so I was in for a surprise when I found out who Aidan really was and what family he came from.Charity Jones is not your typical teenager girl - she's a science genius and popular target for bullying at her school. However, when her mother brings home Aidan, a homeless boy, everything changes. The self-conscious girl can't believe there's actually someone interested in her, and soon she experiences her first true love. However, a happy end is not meant to be. First, there's Charity's brother, a drug dealer and overall mean character, who blames Charity and Aidan for his failures. But even more dangerous is the evil father Aidan fled from - and who is determined to bring his son home. Also, Aidan seems to have some secrets of his own, and when a monster starts terrorizing the neighborhood which shares the same startling blue eyes as Aidan, Charity doesn't know whom to trust any longer. With the help of her equally misfit friends, she is determined to solve the puzzle, unaware of the deadly danger they get themselves in.* the following may contain spoilers *I really really loved the outcome of the plot, as I had no idea about Aidan's origin, which features one of my favorite evil creatures. I also liked the concept of the 'split personality' of Aidan's father, making him the perfect yin and yang of Christmas.The one thing I would criticize about this book was the writing style. While it seems to fit the way teenagers think and talk perfectly (I guess), it slightly got on my nerves sometimes. However, I hope this will not label the book as YA only, as the plot itself should please older readers as well.The ending - clever idea to stop when it was the most exciting and only add a final, more comforting chapter after the epilogue - may hint at a sequel, but not necessarily so. I'd definitely appreciate to read more about Charity and Aidan.

Charity, the main character, was someone I could relate to, even though I am not a STEM person or a skeptical. I was bullied for being different back in high school. I am unfamiliar with Krampus, having only just learned about him last year thanks to American Dad, and I thought the way Maria Alexander retold his story, and Santa\u2019s, was quite interesting. The ending was a disappointment. I\u2019m all for cliff-hangers, but I think I would have preferred the author to stop at the end of the final chapter and not added an epilogue.

Snowed is one of the best modern YA books I've ever read, period. I literally could not put it down: I stayed up reading until 5:00 a.m. because I was so drawn into the world and the plot.[DISCLAIMER: I know the author personally. This has not influenced my review.]Snowed is written from the first-person point of view of our main character, Charity Jones. Charity is simply wonderful. For one thing, she's real: she's a bit on the chubby side, doesn't think of herself as pretty, curses her hair regularly, and such. She's also absurdly smart--as in \"she can build working robots\" smart--and she suffers a lot at school because of that, because of her drug-dealing brother Charles, because she's biracial, and because she's a skeptical atheist whom some of the most ultra-religious students enjoy tormenting. (This book came out last year, but the bullying aspect now seems more timely than ever.) Charity is far from perfect and she makes mistakes, but she's brave, funny, a self-proclaimed geek, and she has a good heart to go with her brilliance. It's no wonder that the mysterious Aidan MacNichol falls for her.This book has plenty of romance, but Aidan is more than just Charity's love interest: he's a huge part of the mystery at the heart of Snowed. He's vague about where he comes from and why he ran, and while his old-fashioned speech and mannerisms are charming they don't really fit in anywhere. Charles resentfully views Aidan as competition for his family, and that conflict escalates horribly as Charity and Aidan grow closer. But beyond that, Aidan seems to know things no one can know, and do things no one should be able to do. Something strange is happening, and Charity's skeptical radar is pinging like mad while her common sense wars with her feelings. (Ugh. My review is not doing this book justice. I don't write nearly as well.)On top of everything else, Charity's worst bully turns up torn to pieces behind the bleachers. The stakes are genuine and serious. Snowed is a marvelous blend of mystery, romance, dark fantasy, thriller, and yes, a Christmas story. If you can't imagine that as a successful combination, trust me: you are in for a real treat.I tend to be a bit kind in my reviews in general. This is emphatically not such a review. If you liked Twilight and its ilk, you will love Snowed; if you hated Twilight and wished it had been better written, you will adore Snowed.

There is an instant attraction between them but when one of Charity\u2019s bullies turn up dead, Charity and Sceptic club start to investigate and find out more about Aidan and his evil father than they expected. Adding to Charity\u2019s problems is also her drug dealer, regular bad boy brother Charles, who blames everyone else for his wrong decisions.I took to Charity straight away, even though she was constantly bullied, she stuck to her beliefs and didn\u2019t change herself to fit in. It was a pleasant change to have a girl who was into robotics and science. All her history made her a natural born leader that was admired within her close nit of friends. Aidan character came across as a really sweet and you can understand why Charity\u2019s mom took him in. I enjoyed how he took to modern technology and embraced the simple tasks of learning to ride a bike and to get a part time job. One of my favourite characters was Michael keeping himself to himself, I loved his one liners and I enjoyed how the author developed these characters throughout the book, telling us more about their storiesEven though, throughout the book there were hints of who Aidan\u2019s dad was.

I tend not to read books with a Christmas theme, but I am glad I read this. This story has everything for a YA fantasy read, action, with a touch of romance and you get the horror element from Aidan\u2019s brother and sisters. I got so into the story that I could not believe that it ended on a cliff-hanger, but after I read the acknowledgements I was pleased to come across the epilogue which I thought would complete the story.

When her family picks up and leaves the suburbs of Los Angeles for the suburbs of Sacramento, a hotbed of conservatism, this fish out of water is dumped from the frying pan into the fire!When Charity starts a support group for people that question God, her popularity which was already on the lowest level of the totem pole sinks even lower and she becomes the easy target for bullies.Charity\u2019s life becomes even more complicated when her mother brings home, Adian, a runaway with a mysterious past and when one of her tormentors end up dead and in a particularly brutal way, what comes to light will have Charity questioning even more than the existence of God.This book is amazing, it\u2019s so difficult to categorize! It\u2019s a murder mystery, a paranormal adventure, a scary monster story and a study in dysfunctional family dynamics. So many teenagers will relate to different parts of this book because so many issues relevant to teenagers are touched upon.Snowed is definitely for the older teenager because some weighty issues are dealt with in this well-told novel and there is language. Although this book has holiday elements in it, Snowed can truly be read and enjoyed at any time of the year.If you want to be that \u201ccool\u201d parent give Snowed as a gift to your teenager. I can definitely see this book as the start of an awesome series featuring Charity and her close-knit group of monster hunters.I received this book through Net Galley."}, {"userName": "Eveline", "userReviewDate": "Dec 27, 2016", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/944669-eveline", "userReview": "Snowed is a rather different kind of holiday read.. If you prefer teen-angst and monsters to just another feel-good Christmas story, this is probably what you are looking for.It wasn\u2019t really my cup of tea, but since it\u2019s a short story I was able to finish it quite easily. Even though the real crazy, horror stuff is saved for the second half, it was the first part that I found hard to believe. The main character is supposed to be an incredibly smart girl, but she comes across so young and na\u00efve \u2013 and how could she not see there was something fishy going on?! It also annoyed me to no end that she is so gullible and judgemental of others, which are two things that she likes to accuse everyone else of (over and over). It was mainly the lead character that brought the story down for me. The other characters are far more likeable and the story is also perfectly creepy. Since it\u2019s pretty short, I would say to give it a chance if you are intrigued by the synopsis! I received an advance reader copy from the publisher via NetGalley."}, {"userName": "D.J.

Especially as I'm currently encased in Pittsburgh's chilled embrace...SNOWED quickly swept me up in a storm of strong characters, mythological fantasies, and a romance that balanced out the horror of Krampus...and growing up.

Having loved the author's previous book, \"Mr. Wicker,\" I knew I had to check this one out. It's about a biracial teen, Charity, who shares her father's aptitude for engineering. Her parents adopt a new foster brother, Aidan, who is a mystery from the start. Things go down a terrible path when Charity discovers the body of one of her gruesomely murdered classmates, and when she finds out the culprit, as well its connection to Aidan, things start to take a turn for the worse. Given the subject matter and the appearance of a certain memorable mythological figure from Christmas, it would have been very easy for this book to get ridiculous, but the author deftly handles the plot with intrigue and thriller elements that made this book impossible to put down. Maria Alexander's prose is clear and engaging, her characters memorable, and the plot riveting. It's also the perfect time of year to read this book as we're approaching the winter holiday season.

It was so different and fun compared to the other \"typical\" Christmas novels that come out around that time. It's got the perfect mix of paranormal and teenage cynicism, and Charity and her Skeptics Club are exactly the people you want in this situation. The plot itself was filled with twists and turns, right when you think you had the entire thing figured out, turns out that what you thought was actually completely wrong. The pros are countless in this book; strong female characters, a diverse cast, a complete plot twisting adventure. There are a few cons, just a few reasons why it didn't get a completely 5 star rating from me. At times, it felt like the relationship between Charity and Aiden was a little rushed, some of the events felt out of pace for the rest of the book.\u00a0Overall, it was a book a thoroughly enjoyed by an author who's just an absolutely amazing person.

But why though? Why do I see so many stars on this book? I hated it but I still gave it 2 stars. Why? Well, the story was good, great even. It had a surprisingly dark twist to our favorite Christmas legend. And the diversity - the main character is a biracial, robot-making skeptic, with a sharp tongue and mind. She also has a friend that's gay and at least one or two more who aren't white. But I am not going to say HO-HO-HO for it. The first thing that made me so furious about this book was this: the romance. The kind of romance that makes such a \"strong, female character\" go weak in her knees and forget all her principles when she sees the boy's silky smooth lips and feels his velvety soft fingers that make her want to hold him forever. People, this happened on the second(?) day that they met. Also, she falls in love with him on page 46 (I think. I won't bother checking). I CAN'T EVEN ugggghhhhhh. She was such a great and interesting character to me that I couldn't help but get outrageously mad every time she fell into pieces whenever she saw the guy. I mean, you call yourself a skeptic? Don't even get me started with the stereotyping in this book. Her brother - who seems to me like he was made out to be the main villain in this book because he did drugs, hated school, and was basically an asshole - wasn't given any proper explanation as to why he was that way and why he hated the MC and her friends so much. And for a POC, I believe that that sort of portrayal is very problematic. Yes, the MC was also a POC, but she was smart and she had white friends. While he wasn't given any redeeming qualities whatsoever. Now that my head has cleared up a bit I would like to appeal to all those who will read this to read carefully and not let it make stereotyped images of POCs in their heads, since these are what these books are wont to do."}, {"userName": "Kristyn - Reading to Unwind", "userReviewDate": "Feb 05, 2017", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/50360622-kristyn---reading-to-unwind", "userReview": "This book follows Charity Jones who is an engineering genius who is also a free thinker at a very conservative school. Charity is constantly bullied at her school for her belief system. She has a few close friends from engineering who stand by her side. The story has really two parts at first we are hunting for a beast and then we get a complete picture of what is going on after. I am going to try really hard and not give any spoilers in my review, it will be challenging since the book takes a lot of turns. The book is very fast paced in my mind when reading. There were portions that I didn't want to stop reading and needed to know what was going to happen and also points where I needed to stop and think about things. The author did a great job with all of the details in the book it was easy to follow along with. Charity was a very interesting character in the book. The author did a great job creating a larger personality for her. Charity really grows a lot during this book from the beginning to the end. Charity comes off as a strong person in the book and she really grows even stronger throughout the book. She endures all of the bullying and comes out prosperous. Things I didn't love in the book I guess was the storyline. The story was building up to who Aidan was for a long time in the book. There was a lot of action going on during the build up and then when it happened I just couldn't believe that is where the story went. I just had so many emotions invested when we learn about Aidan I was almost completely turned off from the book. I just felt like there are some things that are really had to fictionalize and bring into the fantasy world and this was one of them for me personally. It felt like to many real details where part of the build up and also the harm done to Aidan was to well described for me. Also, Charity has a brother named Charles who is a complete psychopath in the book. I felt like they didn't really touch on him enough. I mean he took a big leap I felt from going from some bullying to what he did. There had to be a lot more going on with him before the book and we didn't really get that information so I felt like it took to big of a leap here and it was another hard point for me to accept. The Aidan and Charity relationship to wasn't my favorite thing in the book. It felt sort of rushed and they really didn't know much about he each and then they were in love. I needed more of a build up on this relationship to see it happen. I would probably read the next book in the series because the author did a great job setting up the second book in the ending. I feel like I would want to know what was going to happen to the characters. I would suggest this as a nighttime read. There were natural stopping points in the book as well as points where the action picked up and you just wanted to keep reading. This book will definitely take your mind off of your day. I received a copy of this book from The Fantastic Flying Book Club for the purpose of providing on honest review. This does not effect my opinion of this book."}, {"userName": "Giorgiana", "userReviewDate": "Jan 19, 2017", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/14328838-giorgiana", "userReview": "I don't know how to start this because once again I don't know what I really feel about this book. I will try to talk about the book itself and I will write along what I felt about it.The main character of this story is Charity Jones, a young girl who is bullied in school by others because she is different. By others, I mean all the usual bullies, cheerleaders, and the jock types. She is an intelligent girl with a natural talent for science and engineering. Her life is treating her really bad, but everything starts to change when her family takes in as a foster child, a runaway, named Aidan. Soon, they will fall in love. And this is something that quite annoyed me. How Charity would say that she won't be able to live without Aidan, or how she can't breathe if he isn't around. I know that this is supposed to be a love between two teenagers, but I personally think that is too much.Anyway, the perfect Christmas time is destroyed by the discovery of a body of Charity\u2019s worst bully behind the bleachers, savaged and torn apart. The authorities will suspect it as an animal attack, but Charity is sure that the true is another. She, with her friend's help, will start a mission of finding the murderer.The story or the overall idea is good, but I felt and I still feel that something is missing. The book is really easy to read, the characters are well described, but what annoyed me again was the fact that all the adults seemed to be busy with all the Christmas preparation or with planning their holiday, and none seemed to care about all the troubles around them. And the 'fantastic group', as I want to name Charity and her friends, is the only one who is capable of doing something right or finding the murderer. I didn't enjoy this so much. I mean, I get that she is special and skilled but finding the murderer is an adult job, not theirs. Even her name I think that is too much.Overall, is a quite good book, and I recommend it. Is another type of Christmas story, and I am sure that others will enjoy it more that I did."}, {"userName": "Nina", "userReviewDate": "Dec 27, 2016", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/6966922-nina", "userReview": "Glad I had saved 'Snowed' for this time of the year - although I had forgotten what it was really about and turned out to be more perfect than I thought.

Stereotyping the characters was something which made me stumble more. First I wanted to give it the benefit of the doubt... yet everything seemed to be carefully chosen. Too careful. Was it really necessary to stress on it that Charity and her brother biracial? The blurb says it's part of why she's bullied at school. Though I didn't see any of that. More likely cos she's a nerd. Her views are different. Skin color doesn't seem to matter here. Yet again, when her brother is sent to juvie, it is mentioned again. Whyyyyy???It didn't stop there. I can sum up a list of situations where I felt stereotyping was ruining the moment. Look at me: I have colored hair and I love math... yet I am not Asian and I do not consider myself an artist.I truly want to love this story. It's fabulous!

I really did like it and was very original, just has me still scratching my head a bit. Charity Jones has a huge problem fitting in.

Grisly attacks and a murder take place that obviously derives from something not human. Charity and her friends set out to hunt this beast before they become victims.
