I had some serious reservations about Mainspring. Its sequel, Escapement, might be an interesting example of how to avoid the dreaded \"middle book syndrome\" that afflicts so many trilogies. Categorically superior, Escapement is the maturation of the fantastic premise Lake began in Mainspring, without the insufferable protagonist and his vague, fuzzy quest from God.Whereas the narrator of Mainspring followed only Hethor, Escapement follows three characters. Two of them were minor characters in the first book: Emily Childress, the librarian who initially aids Hethor; and Angus al-Wazir, chief petty officer about the ill-fated Bassett. The third, our protagonist, is Paolina Barthes, a young woman of Portuguese descent who has spent her entire life in Praia Nova, a settlement along the Wall populated by the descendents of shipwrecked and outcast sailors. Paolina is provincial in the sense that she knows very little about the outside world. When she builds a unique piece of clockwork that allows her to manipulate reality itself, she sets off in search for England and its \"wizards.\" Suffice it say, she's sorely disappointed.I like Lake's decision to shift to three perspectives. All three characters are much more interesting than Hethor. Paolina at least seems to have a well-developed sense of the moral implications of what she's doing, and she sets out with a very specific goal in mind. This is preferable to Hethor's, \"Well, I guess I'll find the Key Perilous. Or maybe I won't\" method of operation. I also got a palpable sense of Paolina's frustration with the misogynistic world order embodied by Praia Nova's fidalgos. Despite Hethor's class-based oppression in the first book, I couldn't sympathize with his hardship, probably because of the golden tablets that kept falling from the sky whenever he needed reassurance. Aside from a brief cameo by an angel at the end of the book, Paolina's experiences notably lack a religious dimension.This is true of Escapement as a whole, and that pleases me. The central conflict is temporal: Childress finds herself the unexpected representative of one secret society, the avebianco or \"white birds,\" sent as ambassador/sacrificial lamb to the alliance between another secret society, the Silent Order, and the Chinese. These two are collaborating to construct a metaphorical bridge over the Wall. Meanwhile, England has dispatched a team to bore a tunnel through the Wall; Al-Wazir is attached as resident Wall expert and general safety officer.There is a spiritual component to the conflict. Childress opposes the Golden Bridge project because she recognizes that it will destroy the balance between the two halves of the Earth. Such a bridge would allow the two powerful empires in the Northern Earth to spill into the South, which is still a land of untamed magic. Similarly, Paolina is frightened of her newfound power, especially once she sees what is possible when it falls into the hands of the Silent Order. However, the spiritual component is just that: it's a part of something larger. Mainspring, in which the fate of the world literally depended upon Hethor succeeding, failed because Lake concentrated too much on the big picture. He didn't spend enough time establishing details that would make me care about saving this world. Escapement gives us a much broader look at the politics and philosophies present on this clockwork Earth, which makes the story much richer, and thus better.We only run into problems again toward the end of the story. While Paolina has more specific goals than Hethor, her disappointment and disillusionment with England and the wider world in general strikes a blow to those goals. She wanders somewhat aimlessly afterward, and as a result, the book itself loses its sense of direction. Perhaps it's true that Paolina's confusion is a realistic and natural response to her experiences. That's all well and good. But fiction can't always be realistic, and Escapement does not sustain the level of drama necessary to keep me engaged throughout the final chapters. There are some more airship battles and some magical translocation and character drama as Paolina tries to decide how to deal with her power. Unfortunately, Lake does not synthesize these disparate dramatic elements into a single, unified plot.I'm in the strange position of having finished Pinion today, prior to writing this review. So I know how the series ends, and I've already started forming my opinion of it overall\u2014but I don't want to spoil my next review! Escapement is definitely better than Mainspring, and in some ways it made me think I judged the latter too harshly, because I don't see much of a difference in the quality of the writing. My subjective tastes aside, I think it also demonstrates how choices in the scope of a plot and the perspective of the narrator can affect the reader's experience. Mainspring had high stakes but was confined to a narrow perspective that I just didn't like, so I had a hard time liking the book. Escapement branches out a bit even as it tamps down the ambition, resulting in a much more balanced read.On its own, comparisons cast away for now, Escapement has a strong theme about relationship between self and the orderly world, whether that world is the spiritual or the temporal. Paolina rebels against the world order as she perceives it. She rebels against the men in power, and against her own role as a woman. She does so vehemently:\"If I may ask, why do you travel as a girl? Slim as you are, you could wear trousers and pass for a young man. People would devil you much less if you did so.\"\"I\u2026\" It wasn't as if Paolina didn't understand that to be a possibility. \"Men are \u2026 men. The venom in the voice surprised her. \"I don't want to be one, even for a moment.\"(Ellipses and the horrible double negative are both Lake's.) Paolina is staunch and uncompromising in her principles. She abhors when her power results in death and refuses to be kill anyone else to save herself. This is something I admire, and it's this type of convicted characterization that makes Paolina a much better protagonist than Hethor (oh, there I go with the comparison again).Childress and al-Wazir both experience their own small rebellions. The former assumes the identity of a dead Mask, becoming herself as a Mask, which is a very interesting look at the whole idea of the performance of self. The latter uncomfortably assumes a role in a government-sponsored expedition to the Wall. A petty officer at heart, al-Wazir isn't really sure what to do with himself, so it's not surprising when he finds himself helping the Brass man Boaz instead of pursuing his duty to Dr. Ottweil. In both cases, these characters find themselves making choices to deviate from their previous sensibilities about how the world should be. Watching the consequences unfold from there makes Escapement a fair bit entertaining.While far from even espying perfection on a clear day, Escapement merits praise and a grudging amount of steampunk love (which is like regular love, only coal-fired and administered by a system of pulleys and gears). So here's something I don't often recommend: don't read the first book. Skip to this one. It's better, and on its own it's even good.My Reviews of the Clockwork Earth series:\u2190 Mainspring | Pinion \u2192"}, {"userName": "Nicholas Karpuk", "userReviewDate": "Sep 14, 2009", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/1574263-nicholas-karpuk", "userReview": "\"Every character should want something, even if it is only a glass of water.\" - Kurt VonnegutJay Lake has many good qualities as an author. He created a very compelling world with Mainspring, a world built of gears from the ground up. His fluid writing style helps propel you through this world faster than your disbelief can keep up. The second book started out promising. His weak link in the first book had been a protagonist who had nothing to recommend himself. The generic young man who had surprising powers and a strength no one realized goes on a quest! Generic to say the least.A sequel with three unique protagonist promised to give him more room to breath. They're all off the beaten path when it comes to personalities and motives. It sounded like a distinct improvement upon the Legend of Zelda blandness of the first protagonist.And for about 300 pages it worked just fine. There were issues with how he seems to create interesting characters, but doesn't appear to empathize with them all that greatly. It seemed like something you'd expect from a compulsive writer who might possibly have Aspergers. He creates neat characters, but doesn't seem to connect with them, like them, or want to know them better.Which is why it all falls apart in the last act. I reached a point in the book where every character basically ran out of story. The young girl who had sought out the English \"Wizards\" ends up wandering Europe looking for...... not even sure. The grizzled Scotsman fails his initial mission and wanders through Africa because.... And the third story about a woman captured by the Chinese due to mistaken identity didn't really have much of a purpose to begin with.Lake is a terrible writer for plot. You could describe his stories like a dream, as a series of things that happened one after the other without doubling back or fitting together. This structure was starting to show its age back when Voltaire used it.It stinks of a story created in spite of its protagonists. He backed himself into a corner, and when the characters run out of interesting things to do, I ran out of interest in the story. His lack of sympathy for his creations had already become galling, and when I no longer worried about what would happen next, I decided to pull out the bookmark and call it a day."}, {"userName": "Ian", "userReviewDate": "Jun 28, 2009", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/2465351-ian", "userReview": "[deep breath ... and ... sigh ...:] I was really expecting to enjoy this book since I had thoroughly enjoyed Mainspring. Instead I found myself disappointed.In the interest of full disclosure, let me state that I only made it 80 pages in before I decided to return Escapement to the library. And the tough thing is I'm not really sure I can articulate why this book didn't do it for me.I suppose my primary disappointment is the characters were too obvious, their actions too predictable. This is an ironic complaint, I know, given that the obvious nature of the creator metaphor in Mainspring didn't bother me at all. I also understand that there's a fine line authors must walk: on the one hand you don't want the characters so predictable as to be boring, while on the other hand you don't want the characters to be so unpredictable as to lack sense or motivation. In this case, however, I found the characters' thought processes a little repetitive, their motivation just a little too easy to pick out. Maybe if I had continued with Escapement I would have found the depth and subtlety I was hoping for. Unfortunately I just didn't want to keep going.The most telling sign, for me, was that when I found myself with time to read -- after the kids go to bed, or when I have some free time at work, etc -- I wasn't looking forward to reading Escapement. When a book pushes my buttons I can't wait to read it; I anticipate those moments when the house has quieted down, or work has slowed down, so I can pick up the book and escape to someplace that expands my feelings, thoughts, and imagination. Escapement simply didn't evoke that kind of anticipation in me."}, {"userName": "Ian", "userReviewDate": "Jan 08, 2016", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/8698328-ian", "userReview": "I have not read Lake's first book in this steampunk setting, Mainspring, but this one is quite good. The world building and character development are top notch. The setting is bizarre but finely textured, a place made real by the imagination. The characters are engaging and believable. The dialogue has an unfortunate tendency to end up in false profundity, but at least Lake is using dialogue to dramatize conflict. I also think the plotting is good on a small scale, with lots of intense conflict and sharp rising action. It's too bad that the overall plot arc is so flawed. Characters wander back and forth with increasingly vague motivation, and the three main threads of narrative coincide at the end only briefly and to little purpose. The MacGuffin, a mysterious device carried by the main character, is far too powerful and ends up subverting the narrative, eventually with terminal results. The story feels as if it was conceived as a cool beginning and then had to muddle through to an end. The plot also works like a tabletop role playing game because it so often focuses on the immediate test of characters' various skills. These flaws, however, only turn what would have been an amazing book into a very good one.Fair warning: Those who demand romance may be disappointed that there is none, which is not to say that characters don't fall in love with each other, because they do."}, {"userName": "Martin Clark", "userReviewDate": "Jul 31, 2012", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/5264493-martin-clark", "userReview": "The second of the Clockwork Earth trilogy and I enjoyed it as much as the first, although I found it quite different in some ways. The whole idea of the Earth as a part of a clockwork universe, with a miles high wall at the equator topped with copper teeth that mesh with the huge copper track on which it turns around the Sun, is still fascinating. And I like the liberal mix of magic, monsters, science and the inexplicable which populates the world.Strangely, in this book, there doesn't seem to be much of a plot. Although each of the main characters has many adventures, they don't seem to have much of a plan, or much control over their own fates. They are simply pushed or pulled from place to place, and there is a certain fascination in watching their independent \"orbits\" knowing, from the reader's perspective, that they would almost certainly be meeting up somewhere towards the end.However, I must say that, for me, the book has a genuine sense of suspense in the latter part because, unlike a typical adventure story, it was not at all clear how things would turn out and who would survive.

"userReviewDate": "Jan 05, 2009", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/1839721-joe-informatico", "userReview": "In many ways, Escapement is a better book than its predecessor, Mainspring. Mainspring focused on the protagonist Hethor, who is the type of messianic hero common to this type of fantasy/sf bildungsroman: a socially isolated but intelligent young man who is thrust into a mission to save the world. He of course, does so, in the process earning the four essential marks of manhood: self-reliance, authority over others, physical prowess, and sexual experience. The setting in Mainspring was brilliantly imaginative, but as I leave my 20s behind me, I realize I don't give a toss about coming-of-age stories anymore, so I was less impressed with a plot and character arc I've read so many times already.Escapement returns us to Lake's fantastic setting, but through the eyes of three characters this time, two of whom had brief roles in Mainspring. These two are more interesting, Head Librarian Emily Childress, a sexagenarian thrust into the first adventure of her life, and Threadgill Al-Wazir, Scottish-Arab airship sailor of the Royal Navy, sent as part of a British Imperial mission to drill through the Equatorial Wall girding the Earth. The stories of two seasoned professionals, perhaps on the verge of retirement, forced into active duty again, but into the unfamiliar terrain of geopolitical engagement and shadow conflicts between secret societies, was extremely compelling. The third is Paolina Barthes, for whom another coming-of-age story plays out, this time the distaff version. Paolina's tale is far more interesting than Hethor's, as the latter was basically following a trail of breadcrumbs God had left for him, while Paolina seems a far more active agent in her own destiny. She does come across as a Marion Zimmer Bradley heroine at times, railing against patriarchy at every turn (Lake's alternate version of the Victorian Era seems *more* patriarchal than ours in the real world. It would have been interesting to explore the reasons further. Maybe in the next book.)The book's main weakness is that it's a bridge. Figuratively, it's a sequel that's setting up for another sequel, and thus suffers from all the weaknesses of similar books like The Two Towers or Harry Potter and the Order of the Phoenix--a whole lot of moving pieces on the chessboard but not being allowed to checkmate. Literally, however, it deals with the attempts by both the British and Chinese Empires to build a bridge to the other half of the world, presumably to continue their colonial games on virgin soil, while our heroes try to prevent it. All that said, Lake greatly expands the setting that is his main attraction, and thickens the plot nicely. I'm eagerly awaiting the next book."}, {"userName": "Graham Crawford", "userReviewDate": "Nov 03, 2013", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/5884833-graham-crawford", "userReview": "Most readers would agree that this second book in the series is a vast improvement on the first. Jay Lake is better known as a short story writer and the long-form first person narrative in \"Mainspring\" really exposed his weaknesses in technique. The switch to rapidly alternating points of view from three protagonists (and their companions) starts to play to his strengths.I am guessing he's had some long conversations with fans after the first book was published because their are a lot of plot holes that are plugged up in this book. It reminded me of the fixes Larry Niven made to his Ringworld after the geeks had fun tearing apart the physics. He's also put a lot more thought into character and plot.The real strength of this series so far is it's ambiguity. There is no clear sense of whether the Clockwork Universe is created by a god one should worship and obey. Likewise it is unclear whether the various societies and empires are agents of good or evil. Choice and morality are determined at the individual level. Jay Lake has clearly put some work into thinking about the ethics, something that most Steampunk writers rarely bother with. It's not yet on a par with China Mi\u00e9ville's political thinking, but in some ways it is a warmer narrative.There are ongoing themes of sexism, racism, and class-ism in colonial industrial societies. All the protagonists struggle with (and against) these prejudices, and to some extent show some ethical improvements in their character over the book. From time to time this gets a little heavy handed (such as Paolina's ongoing \"all men are bastards\" rant), but it works most of the time - providing an interesting source of conflict between the various characters and their companions.Lake's dialogue can be a little shaky especially when dealing with \"English as a second language\". At times he borders on \"He no speaky Englishy\". The worst example was the dreadful German Dr Ottweil who structures sentences like George Lucas' Yoda on a bad day. Lake's obviously not a racist because he spends quite a bit of time exploring the unpleasantly racist attitudes of the various Empires - but this sort of dialogue borders on passive racism. There are smarter and more sensitive ways to describe the way people in other cultures speak, but at least he is trying, and so one can hope for improvement in future novels."}, {"userName": "Pepper", "userReviewDate": "Nov 14, 2011", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/6117707-pepper", "userReview": "Escapement, by Jay Lake. 3 Stars out of 5. A novel set in a SteamPunk universe where the world is hollow and filled with gears, and a giant Wall dividing the world is guarded by mechanical Brass Men. This is the sequel to Mainspring (maybe, it\u2019s hard to tell if it\u2019s actually a sequel). The story follows a young girl from a tiny fishing village who wants to see more of the world, and as fate would have it, is compelled to do just that. Soon into her journey, she learns of the great mechanical prowess of the British, and sets out for England. However, her skills in constructing the rare Gleam attract the attentions of evil-doers, and her magnificent adventure ensues.The book is a little slow to start, but by the end of the first chapter, I was into it. The quality of the writing is slightly above average, and probably worth reading for the SteamPunk enthusiast. However, compared to other respected works, such as those by Arthur C. Clarke, James Rollins, C.S. Lewis, or Anne Rice, it\u2019s just not as good. Don\u2019t get me wrong, it\u2019s a good story, and I wanted the story to continue; but for the non-SteamPunk\u2019r, this book is a solid \u201cmaybe\u201d. It made me want to read Mainspring.

There are three main characters in the novel: one is obsessed with measuring and discoverers that she has a rare and powerful gift: a gift that could be used to reshape the world. The second is tasked with a huge engineering project: to drill through the Equatorial wall (on which the brass gear is set) separating Northern and Southern Earth. The third was to be offered as a 'sacrifice' between two secret societies but current events turn her into a pawn in a battle between the secret societies and also between the two Northern Earth empires: British and Chinese.The three characters converge at the end but not too convincingly: it requires a 'god-like' act for this to happen and some events appear coincidental: enemy forces appear at the just the right moment to move the plot along (a weakness of \"Mainspring\" also).Still, this novel provides another interesting look at Lake's Earth.

A fun read but one that leaves you wishing for more than you got."}, {"userName": "Rm", "userReviewDate": "May 13, 2009", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/1177676-rm", "userReview": "A very strange book, wherein the world is divided between North and South by a giant range of mountains, called The Wall. The world is also run by an elaborate system of clockwork brass devices. I think the book is a sequel to an earlier book, because I am a bit baffled by some of the references, which are clearly meant to be understood by readers of a previous text -- but for pure, and very clever, diversion, this is a great read."}, {"userName": "Brandur", "userReviewDate": "Jul 27, 2011", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/5896508-brandur", "userReview": "The steampunk story of a young girl looking for guidance in a world that reflects an alternate possibility of the Imperialist days of Britain. The world itself is the mechanical creation of God and is split in two by a giant wall, it contains brass men, airships, Chinese submarines, secret societies and monstrous gods. Good premise, but finishes a little weak with many plots not properly wrapped up."}], "description": "In his novel Mainspring, Lake created an enormous canvas for storytelling with his hundred mile high Equatorial Wall that holds up the great Gears of the Earth.
