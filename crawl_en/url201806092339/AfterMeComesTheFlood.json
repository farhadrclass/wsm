It starts off fine - it's nicely, if simply, written and the mysterious nature of the plot gives it an interesting edge. And then you realize that there's really nothing coming - there's no mystery and no backstory of any real consequence. The characters are somewhere in between likeable and unlikeable, and there's very little depth to their personalities or their motivations.I'm actually shocked I even finished it, and that's the reason for the second star - there must have been something that kept me turning the pages, although at the moment (a few weeks after finishing it) I can't really recall what that something was."}, {"userName": "T.D. Whittle", "userReviewDate": "Apr 11, 2017", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/6051061-t-d-whittle", "userReview": "Sarah Perry is my favourite newly-discovered author. Like her latest book, The Essex Serpent, After Me Comes The Flood is rich with imagery both lush and ascetic, and characters who are never fully revealed, to themselves or to the reader. The plot, too, is set up as the slow uncovering of a rather sad mystery but (again like The Essex Serpent) is both more and less than one expects, and yet its denouement feels inevitable and fits the overarching narrative like a kid glove.I've a feeling that Sarah Perry either draws readers in with her elusive symbolism or drives them away. As for me, I like that her ideas stay with me for days after finishing her books, offering up fresh interpretations that did not occur to me while I was reading. Her humour is subtle, too, and I found myself laughing after the fact, as I got some of the jokes (most especially in the form of word play and metaphors made literal) only hours after I'd read them.I have read a few reviews of this book and of The Essex Serpent which compare Perry's writing to Kafka and, especially Serpent to Dickens. She reminds me of neither. Here is where I have to admit that I am not a Kafka fan, while admiring so many of the writers whom he influenced and being grateful to him for that reason. I understand why his work is brilliant, but I cannot connect with it emotionally. I tend not to like books which appeal only to my intellect. I need the whole package, which includes aesthetic seduction as well as intellectual and emotional. For me, Kafka isn't that; though I recognise this is a personal response and he may affect others quite differently.After Me Comes The Flood evoked two authors and their works early on in my reading, and the impression stayed with me throughout: Robert Aickman and Shirley Jackson. In tone, setting, existential alienation, physical isolation, sinister foreboding, uneasy dream-states, and Christian and pagan overtones, After Me echoes various aspects of Aickman's entire ouevre. Certain symbols, such as Perry's unused but ever-present meat hooks, a table overladen with food for so few diners, and a house found by a traveller with a broken down car, slipping unwittingly across borders into an enchanted place, were so reminiscent of Aickman's stories The Hospice, The Stains, The View, and Into The Wood that I could not stop thinking of him as I read her. This is a compliment, not a complaint, as I rarely read anyone who sends me into the type of free-floating, fascinated disorientation that Aickman does. *Jackson's dark sense of humour as well as, specifically, her novel The Sundial were ever present as I read After Me too. The house in Perry's book is similar in so many ways to Jackson's, right down to a misleading sundial, a cloistered group of people who both choose to live there and yet feel unable to leave, too, a prescient childlike figure (an actual child in Jackson's book, but not Perry's), an untrustworthy but indispensable wealthy matriarch; in short, a troupe of characters overflowing with interdependent need and longing, awaiting some final apocalypse that will either redeem or destroy them (maybe both), or maybe never happen at all. In both books, we feel that the fragile tension could shatter like a glass house in a hurricane at any moment, and both authors hold this tension masterfully.There are many other similarities I could discuss, such as the sense of timelessness and the ambiguity of characters' motives, etc. that resonate throughout Aickman's, Jackson's, and Perry's writings, but I am not writing a thesis, merely expressing my thoughts casually and so far as I hope they might interest other readers.I do not compare Perry's writing to Dickens', but his name has been invoked regarding The Essex Serpent by more than one reviewer. Personally, I don't see it. Dickens wrote morally compelling narratives rich with characters who delight and appall us still. But, one must notice that his female characters lack any depth whatsoever. He wrote women as one supposes he viewed women: either desirable and nurturing and lovely, or wicked and base. His lovely ones are so pure of heart and sweet of soul they could slip a reader into a diabetic coma. Of course, I love Dickens. But not for the complex richness of his women. Perry's Cora, on the other hand, is a substantial and fascinating woman, and the women in After Me Comes The Flood while representative of particular archetypes playing out their respective roles in an allegoricical tale, suggest more depth than what they are willing or able to reveal and so leave us with a sense of lingering interest and mystery.I am so looking forward to Perry's next book!* One cannot mention Aickman's The Hospice or Into The Wood without noting his own admiration of Thomas Mann and his allusions to The Magic Mountain in these stories. Likewise, a fainter but nevertheless audible echo is there in Perry. The original beautiful sanitorium of literature, offering healing and rest for weary souls whilst disconnecting them from the outer world, and drawing them into stifling relations with one another, was surely Mann's Berghof. Timeless, enchanting, and unforgettable."}, {"userName": "Kinga", "userReviewDate": "Nov 16, 2014", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/110812-kinga", "userReview": "I read this book a long time ago, so this will be a difficult review to write. I suppose I was waiting for a heatwave to hit London so I can be in the right mood to write this and a heatwave is something you will wait for for a long time in the UK. But I did spend half of this week sitting in a puddle of my own sweat, so here we are. Like the main character I feel an urge to close the shop (I don\u2019t actually have a shop) and fuck off somewhere, get lost and be found by a bunch of strangers who seem to have been waiting for me. This is what happens to John Cole, who goes to visit his brother, gets lost and end up in a strange house with people who know his name and have been expecting him. It\u2019s all very strange and it seems like it\u2019s a place people go to recover and find or lose their faith. The story is set beautifully out of time, somewhere between the times of Biblical plagues and some dystopian future. It\u2019s very en vogue for reviewers to invent new genres when reviewing so I\u2019m going to call it environmental Gothic. And let\u2019s not forget to say \u2018claustrophobic\u2019. Apparently, you can\u2019t review this novel without mentioning it was claustrophobic. So yes, definitely claustrophobic. Weirdness prevails. Of course, Amazon doesn\u2019t have such subtle categories and I believe is putting this book in their thriller section or wherever. It also puts Perry\u2019s new book in the \u2018romance\u2019 section which I\u2019m sure is just as ridiculous.Don\u2019t read this book for the plot and the answers, read it for the atmosphere and the words. It\u2019s half a ghost story, half a Biblical parable. I probably didn\u2019t even understand it really but it doesn\u2019t matter. It\u2019s a brave debut, even if it is not perfect. Despite Amazon\u2019s best efforts it avoids categorisation. Oh, and don\u2019t look for \u2018likeable characters you can relate to\u2019. Unless you\u2019re super weird."}, {"userName": "Blair", "userReviewDate": "Feb 17, 2014", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/272909-blair", "userReview": "Review originally published at Learn This Phrase, as part of a post about this and another of my favourite books of the year, Linda Grant's Upstairs at the Party. (This book was reviewed second in the post, so the review really makes more sense in its original context.)... Next to the expansive scope of Upstairs at the Party, the premise of Sarah Perry's debut novel, After Me Comes the Flood, seems almost the polar opposite: it takes place over just one week, and much of the action is contained within a single building. But like Grant's book, it knocked me off my feet and made me want to weep with a) joy and b) jealousy; and like Grant's book, it turned out to be something other, and better, than what I had expected.Another similarity with Upstairs at the Party is that the blurb I read sparked my interest long before I bought the book. One hot summer's day, John Cole decides to leave his life behind. He shuts up the bookshop no one ever comes to and drives out of London. When his car breaks down and he becomes lost on an isolated road, he goes looking for help, and stumbles into the grounds of a grand but dilapidated house. Its residents welcome him with open arms - but there's more to this strange community than meets the eye. They all know him by name, they've prepared a room for him, and claim to have been waiting for him all along... The surreal aspect of this idea led me to expect something with a paranormal twist: perhaps ghosts? All-knowing stalkers? A secret society? I suppose it's also fair to say that this is (also, again) a collection of tropes that automatically intrigues me (crumbling mansion? check!) and therefore wouldn't be hard for me to love, even if poorly written. But it is brilliantly written, and rises above any clich\u00e9s the plot might seem to suggest.In actual fact, it soon becomes clear that there is a rather more ordinary (if unlikely) explanation for the group's embrace of John. At first this felt like a letdown: I wanted something uncanny, not normal people making a simple mistake. However, there is still plenty of potential for intrigue and a slow-building kind of tension, as John repeatedly resolves to leave this place and finds he has no desire to do so. There is still the question of who these people are and how they came to be here. There is still the mystery of who might be writing hurtful letters to fragile, anxious Alex, or carving the strange name 'Eadwacer' - a remnant of an enigmatic folk tale - in furniture around the house. And what of the nearby reservoir; is there really, as Alex fears, a chance that it will cause a biblical flood and engulf the house? In the shimmering, oppressive heat - perfectly evoked - this seems laughably unlikely, yet a sense of dread remains and it is hard not to feel there is some impending doom awaiting them all. The narrative moves very slowly towards its climax, but for me the pace was an asset, allowing a gradual release of information, the reader kept as much in the dark as John is.The quality of the writing, description and atmosphere reminded me of The Secret History, and that is pretty much the highest compliment I can give. The smallest incident is imbued with endless meaning and symbolism; something as banal as a wallpaper pattern becomes utterly enchanting. Another comparison I am drawn to make - though a fairly useless once, since few people have read it - is L.R. Fredericks' Farundell. I'm mentioning this book not because the two are of similar quality - I found Fredericks' novel disappointing - but because After Me Comes the Flood was everything I wanted Farundell to be: an 'eccentric cast of characters in a big old house' story that manages to avoid stereotypes, complete with glimpses of magic, filled with complex human interaction that is driven by more than just sexual desire. The development of John's relationships with the other residents made me realise how infrequently friendships are portrayed with such care and detail without then being used as a prelude to something else, usually a romantic or sexual relationship. In this story, every tiny nuance of behaviour is carefully noted and everything has a certain significance.In After Me Comes the Flood, very little happens - even an apparently dramatic, potentially disastrous incident produces nothing much in the way of an outcome. Yet it is rich with the power of expert storytelling, soaked in dreamlike atmosphere, and quietly, seductively gripping. It has a fairytale undertone but at the same time is absolutely real, taking you on a journey that is all about character development and self-discovery. Fittingly, what goes on inside the walls of this mysterious house is far more important than any external action, and while there may not be ghosts, this book is undeniably haunting."}, {"userName": "Kevin Ansbro", "userReviewDate": "Feb 19, 2017", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/43579369-kevin-ansbro", "userReview": "Oh dear.Pretentious, tedious; wafer-thin characterisation; no beginning, middle or end.

Thats not to say it is a bad book but the blurb seemed to promise something different (in my opinion) to that which it delivered. When I started I thought there was going to be some mystery, perhaps something a little odd going on, but in the end it was all rather mundane.Having said that, I did get somewhat caught up with this eclectic bunch of characters \u2013 John breaks down on his way to his brothers and seeking help in a nearby house, he is disconcerted when they seem to be expecting him- then, well, he stays. It took me a little bit of suspension of disbelief at this point, because although he was feeling rather poorly in the heat, it did seem entirely unrealistic that, if you arrived at a strangers house for reasons that could not at all have been planned, then find that they seem to have been expecting you all along and know your name, you wouldnt think \u201chang on a minute\u201d and high tail it back to your car toote suite. Maybe its just the horror movie buff in me\u2026.Anyway, once I\u2019d moved passed that I started to become just a little fascinated by the people John encounters in the house \u2013 Hester the matriarch, Walker who I\u2019m still not really sure about, Eve the piano player, Elijah the preacher who has lost his faith, Alex who is somewhat odd and Claire, a childlike woman who has a rather strange outlook on life. For a while I was entranced \u2013 they danced off the page, not really clarified but appealing none the less. As John becomes embedded into their world, there is some beautiful haunting writing and an uneasy feeling created in the reader that is intelligently done.But then nothing really happens. Their day to day interaction has a kind of a plot twist running through it to do with the danger of flood and disaster that may or may not be caused by an approaching storm, and some other things I suppose, but it kind of went a bit flat. Which was a shame really, because there was a great deal of potential here.Even now I\u2019ve finished it (I found the ending to be a bit sudden as well) I\u2019m still not really sure what I think about it. I have since discovered that the author had a strong religious upbringing which explains a lot of religious allegory that threads in and out of the story, but I think perhaps I am not the right audience for this in the end.Well written, with a good premise, I just didnt feel the execution quite lived up to the promise \u2013 however having said that there is a lot here to appeal, one of those \u201cits not you its me\u201d moments when it comes to reading. I just wish that there had been slightly more depth given to some of the characters, it was a \u201ccharacter set piece\u201d if you like, and perhaps too much attention was given to one or two characters over the others which made the whole thing feel a bit disjointed.Lovely prose though. Can\u2019t really fault that.

What this book perhaps fails to deliver in plot and/or character development, it easily makes up for in atmosphere. It is a debut novel and, as such, it shows a talented writer at the beginning of her public development. I found it one of the most impressive debut novels I have read.It\u2019s not that the plot and character development are especially weak. The plot isn\u2019t the main thing as far I can tell. John Cole leaves his failing bookshop and heads for Norfolk to visit his brother. On the way, his car breaks down and he finds himself outside a house. The dreamlike nature of the narrative starts to assert itself at this early stage:\u201dIt seemed to me the most real and solid thing I'd ever seen, and at the same time only a trick of my sight in the heat\u201d.Not only that, but it seems John is expected and how often do you turn up at a house you\u2019ve never visited before only to find you are expected? Except in your dreams, maybe. We quickly discover the reason for this, though. But then there\u2019s the meat hooks, and a broken sundial that tells two times. Everything is disjointed and out of kilter with the \u201creal world\u201d.In chapters that switch between first person narrative narrated by John and a third person, omniscient narrator, we gradually get to know the other residents of the house and uncover their relationships and we see John\u2019s relationships with different characters evolve. So, we do get character development and I actually liked the elements of mystery that remained around the characters.The story is full of Biblical imagery, perhaps especially the book of Genesis. There\u2019s a character called Eve, people spend a lot of time walking round a garden, the story takes place over seven days, one chapter starts with the words On the morning of the sixth day\u2026. And there\u2019s always the threat of an imminent flood.Eadwacer from the Anglo-Saxon poem \u201cWulf and Eadwacer\u201d becomes a significant motif. This poem is renowned for being difficult to interpret despite being only 19 lines long (or perhaps because it is only 19 lines long). I am not sure of the part that this poem plays in the story other than that it adds to the mysterious atmosphere and the sense that we are not being told everything. A difficult to interpret poem within a difficult to interpret book. But it may be that there is more to it than that - I\u2019d be delighted if someone could elucidate in the comments! I\u2019m probably not the first person to suddenly feel stupid for trying to make an anagram out of the word Eadwacer.It\u2019s a personal taste thing, but I found this more intriguing and more compelling than Perry\u2019s subsequent novel The Essex Serpent. That second novel was a very enjoyable story to read and was perfect for reading on holiday a few weeks ago. This one ticks more boxes for me with it\u2019s mystery, its atmosphere and its loose ends."}, {"userName": "Paul Fulcher", "userReviewDate": "May 25, 2017", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/3250759-paul-fulcher", "userReview": "[: by a complete coincidence, someone connected with their group, but known only to Elijah (who doesn\u2019t let on that it is the wrong person), and with a very similar name \u2013 Jonathan Coules \u2013 was expected to be joining the community in the coming days, but had had to cancel his trip.

Wandering in the evening, he comes across a house where, to his surprise, a girl welcomes him \u2013 by name.Without really knowing how it happens, John slips into life at the house, with Hester, Clare, Elijah, Walker, Eve and Alex. They are a strange group; you often feel that you are in a dream sequence in this novel, where people behave almost as caricatures and there is a slight distance from events. Hester is the clumsy, unattractive matriarch, Clare a young woman who behaves in a childlike manner, while all of the house\u2019s inhabitants seem damaged and vulnerable. Meanwhile, a reservoir outside seems to threaten the house itself, with suggestions of floods and violence, someone is leaving poisonous pen letters and John is troubled constantly by headaches. Gradually, events are uncovered. We discover who these people are and why they live together. What originally sounded like a rather creepy scenario is really rather warm and moving. John\u2019s isolation and his desire to fit into a new life is something that it is easy to sympathise with. At times though, the novel is overly descriptive and it is hard to warm to the characters.

Two months after starting it, however, I am extremely disappointed. The main problem for me was the fact that nothing actually happens in the entire 200 pages of it! The whole thing is just a string of uninteresting and unrelated events that occur once the main character, John, stumbles across a little cottage on the edge if a forrest. John soon comes to realise that the occupants of this house know who he is, though he does not know them. They even have a box of his belongings in a spare room. Had the plot actually developed, this may have made a very interesting read, but the fact that we never actually find out who these people are and what the intend for John kind of ruins it.

So despite the mysterious idea behind this book, it's not been the most enjoyable read mainly because I still have no idea what the story behind it actually was."}, {"userName": "John Levon", "userReviewDate": "Feb 09, 2015", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/13231784-john-levon", "userReview": "I'd be pretty annoyed with the blurb writers if I were the author, as the depiction of this novel as a curious mystery story is totally misleading. In fact, the initial oddity is explained away near the top of the book, and we are left with a rather slight, atmospheric book about a group of people thrown together in an out of the way environment.There's a rather austere tone to the writing, like an Ishiguro book, and the mood-setting is done well, but ultimately it all gets a little tedious. There's no real plot and the characters aren't vivid enough to make up for it."}, {"userName": "Maria Longley", "userReviewDate": "Aug 27, 2014", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/16558598-maria-longley", "userReview": "It's eerie and odd and hard to describe, and it'd be great if there were more books like this. The atmosphere of a summer of drought is intense and remarkable and no wonder John Cole finds it tricky to extract himself from a situation of mistaken identity. Time stretches in funny ways so it was a bit of a shock to realise the action (such as it is) only takes place over a week. But then the house has a broken sundial that tells two different times so what can you expect... Nothing, really, is what you would expect. And it's a page-turner."}, {"userName": "Eleanor Fitzsimons", "userReviewDate": "Apr 07, 2016", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/30871993-eleanor-fitzsimons", "userReview": "I loved this book. Intriguing from page one and beautifully written. The characters were fascinating and utterly believable. The plot was compelling and the descriptions of tense, charged, heat-soaked days in a crumbling country house perched on the edge of disaster ensured that I was actually on the edge of my (train) seat as I read.

I think it's meant to be a near future in the grip of increasing climate change - there's been no rain for a month, and no birds - yet the setting is strangely old-fashioned; mobiles do very occasionally pop up, but never the Internet, and the landline and post are the main channels of communication. Normally I find this anachronistic never-never land one of litfic's cardinal sins, but here it's appropriate for the dreamlike mood. Everything is woozy, weary, with things looming large or small out of proportion to the impact one might expect - at one point the resolution of a significant ongoing mystery feels far less weighty than the cranefly killed during the conversation. Whilst I was reading this, there was an incident where the Kobo app (which for some reason seems more sensitive on my 'phone than Kindle) managed to flip me back a chapter*, and I reread a good few pages before realising - but this is not a criticism so much as a testament to the mood. The plot, in so far as it matters, concerns a man leaving a parched London, whose car breaks down en route; he finds his way to a strange house on the edge of the woods where, inexplicably, he seems to be expected. But mostly this is secondary to his interactions with the inhabitants, which play as a funhouse mirror version of an Edwardian country house party - \"Anyone watching would have thought they were fragments of a larger party having a better time\". Each of the residents has their own peculiarities; the title suggests we should pay most attention to the fellow haunted in the drought by visions of a deluge, but for me the most haunting was the former preacher, and Perry's perfect choice of the tiny detail which destroys a faith formerly so solid it had never occurred to him to treat it as anything but a fact of life. And as another character says of the matter, aptly for the times: \"The world ending because its Maker has decided it's high time is one thing. It collapsing without purpose or meaning is quite another.\" Once the listlessness of the pre-storm weather ends, there is something closer to a traditional climax, but it can't help feeling less than the sum of its parts after the exquisitely extended tension of the build-up. Though this reminds me - why do people say 'the calm before the storm?' It's anything but calm, it's prickly and awkward, just as Perry captures here.*It also locked the app in landscape and massively increased the font size, but I'm not sure that illuminates the work in the same way."}, {"userName": "Charlee November", "userReviewDate": "Dec 14, 2017", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/55222343-charlee-november", "userReview": "The set up was good, from how mysterious the circumstances was, till the revelation of why this group of people were in the same house someway mid-way through the book.But nothing really happens. It\u2019s not to say something must happen for a book to be good. Yet there is nothing in place of the lack of a storyline?The writing is strong but too often way too wishy washy for me. Considering the book isn\u2019t that long, so much of it was filled with nothingness.

It kinda reminds me of Reggie Perrin (maybe too old a reference for some of my readers - Google it!) going in to the water!This review is going to be short and sweet, why? Because After Me Comes The Flood is a book you really need to immerse yourself in and no review I write will be able to do it justice.John Cole drives out of London one hot day, he is walking out on his life, putting the city behind him.
