Seriously, I could not put it down. The weeds in my garden are cheering over their reprieve since I spent my gardening time reading instead. This is Jordyn Redwood's debut Love Inspired Suspense novel and it surely won't be her last. The dynamic opening scene fired up my imagination and I just couldn't wait to get to the heart of the suspense...and the romance. An amnesia story can be a tricky thing -- easy to feel trite, riddled with clich\u00e9s. Thankfully that isn't the case in Fractured Memory (and perfect title tie-in, by the way!) Redwood does a marvellous job of incorporating Julia's amnesia into the plot. She might be missing key pieces of memory that make her vulnerable but that doesn't mean she's weak. In fact her experiences along with her faith make her one plucky heroine. And Eli finds that very appealing ...and infuriating at times. :-) Great romantical dynamics as these two draw closer while dodging threats at every turn. Love the fact that Eli has memories to fall back on while Julia can't remember him at all. Brings more tension to both the romance and the suspense. A clever and exciting story that's sure to enthrall romantic suspense readers."}, {"userName": "Olivia", "userReviewDate": "Mar 08, 2017", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/43582060-olivia", "userReview": "{3.5 stars}This suspenseful from the start and definitely had plenty of intrigue.

She seems to have the Love Inspired Suspense formula down, and shots are fired on the second page! And let the race be on... When the safe house she is secreted off to is compromised soon after arrival, the ante is upped and interested is triggered. My suspicions were raised early on as to who the bad \"guy\" might be. Red herrings were planted to keep the reader guessing, but I'd figured it out, since I read enough of these to know the formula and how it works. It is rare for a LIS author to surprise me.

Although this one really is more about romantic suspense than a mysterious malady. And I love Jordyn Redwood's writing technique. She puts more tension and twists into her books than you would think the front and back could successfully contain. This is Jordyn's first venture with Harlequin's Love Inspired, and they have welcomed her with enthusiastically open arms.This one begins with a woman (Julia Galloway) who has oxygen deprivation-induced amnesia and US Marshal (Eli Cayne) who had worked to keep her safe and healing after a near-fatal hanging. She doesn't remember him, but there's something about him that makes her feel safer. The hangman, or so the attacker has been labeled, is safely in prison, but someone has put out a hit on Julia. Why?Daily near-death experiences keep Eli and cohorts on their toes. They put her in a safe house--which is anything but safe. Each place they select results in another attack. Obviously, there's a leak of information from within. Danger escalates to both Julia and Eli.Buy the book now, and solve this puzzle before it's too late!"}, {"userName": "Sarah Grace", "userReviewDate": "May 23, 2018", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/59507807-sarah-grace", "userReview": "RTC"}, {"userName": "Glenda Parker", "userReviewDate": "Jul 15, 2016", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/7167019-glenda-parker", "userReview": "I love Jordyn's work and was thrilled to see that she had joined the LIS Authors. This story is well written, action packed and full of adventure. She wove her faith throughout the story like a tapestry, I like that.Pediatric Nurse Julia Galloway was almost killed over a year ago by a serial killer. The \"Hangman\" had hung her but she had been rescued in time. She had spent the last eighteen months trying to get her life back but the memories of that night were locked up somewhere in her mind. Although one of the doctors Julia worked with had been arrested and awaited a death sentence her name and information had been found on a hit list. Could the killer be someone else? Could the \"hangman\" have a partner? Why was someone after her? Who was this marshal that was helping her? Why did he seem so familiar?US Marshal Eli Cayne had been the police detective that was first on scene at Julia hanging. He had saved her life and had done everything he could to help her during her recovery but it was obvious when he came to her home that those memories were lost in her injured mind. He would do everything he could to protect this woman and find this killer. Unfortunately he didn't think he could protect his heart, she had already stolen that.A journey of two broken soul trying to survive in a world suddenly exploding all around them.

You have a picture of a peaceful looking isolated cabin shattered by what glass would look like when a bullet punctures through it. Sets my heart to racing without even opening the pages! The inside it just as thrilling as the outside. Having an officer of the law come to your house and say to you that a hit has been ordered on your life, that stops the heart all together! Julia has no memory of who Eli is or how he was the one who saved her from dying at the hands of a serial killer named Hangman almost two years ago. There's obvious feelings between these two but they take backstage to the danger surrounding them. With each step they take forward, the killer is always two steps ahead. Can she trust Eli and his team when she almost dies in protective custody, more than once even? This one had me on pins and needles trying to figure out who's after Julia when the Hangman is supposedly on death row. I loved the medical angle and the amnesia ramping up the danger, it made for a breathless combo. Julia's strong faith shone through and seeped into every scene even when she was on the run. Eli, what can I say, was an almost perfect hero. Trying to hide his feelings under the facade of professionalism. The whole book had me guessing, oxygen deprived and my heart pounding. Wow, the end had me surprised and turning pages faster than a speeding bullet! Richly layered storyline, suspense to keep you on your toes, twists and turns galore, faith playing a natural part and romance sizzling underneath makes for a fantastic read!

Within the first few pages I was completely invested in the lives of these imaginary people, and my heart raced as my fingers flipped page after page toward the finish line. Redwood's writing is stellar. Her medical background makes each scene rock solid. Her story pacing is spot on. Now, I must confess; I knew whodunit within the first few chapters. Normally, I find the easy peasy Name The Perp aspect to be a turn off. However, even though I knew who, and they (the good guys) knew, neither of us knew the how or the why.That was enough incentive to keep reading. . .and reading. . .and reading until the last page was turned. And I was very satisfied without feeling placated. I'm still not a fan of the LIS formula. A really great novel needs room to grow. An intense and engaging plot needs room to breathe.

What thoughts might run through your head? Undoubtedly, you'd be reeling from the revelation and the upheaval, especially if it's not the first time you've been victimized by a would-be killer.That's the premise of Jordyn Redwood's latest \"Love Inspired\u00ae Suspense\" novel Fractured Memory. Julia Galloway lost so much the night she was attacked by a serial killer known as \"The Hangman\"; her memory of the event and the days that followed, her security, her parents, who perished on the way to the hospital to see her the day she was nearly murdered. It's not surprising, then, that this latest development sends her into a tailspin emotionally.Meanwhile, US Marshal Eli Cayne, the cop who found her then and helped her recover, is the one who delivers the bad news to her. Struggling with the attachment he formed to her (unbeknownst to her), he weighs his feelings for her against his obligations as a marshal to not get too emotionally involved in the case. Naturally, they develop a relationship forged by the many perilous scenarios they find themselves in. (It wouldn't be a \"Love Inspired \u00ae\" book if they didn't.)From the beginning, the story goes into overdrive, as the two protagonists are thrust into one potentially deadly situation after another. There are also plenty of opportunities for Julia, a pediatric nurse (as is the author), to utilize her medical expertise or relate events in the story to her past patients. The apparently gorgeous Colorado landscape (I wouldn't know; I've never left my home province of Ontario) provides the perfect backdrop for danger and romance both. Faith also plays an important part in the character's lives; God is an ever-present source of strength for them when they call upon Him.Regrettably, I have a confession to make; I knew who done it (or rather, who was going to done it) almost immediately; several hints dropped throughout were easy to follow. That doesn't usually happen with me, and I'm unsure whether that's a common feature of a lot of these short novels or just this one. So that kind of took the wind out of my sails. But aside from that, it made an enjoyable read; I started and finished it in one afternoon.Jordyn Redwood cleverly juggles a myriad of twists and turns to paint a picture of the kind of healing and hope we can find in God and each other when we begin to trust again.

What a start to a fast pace mystery. There you are quietly in your home, and you hear a knock on your door. I suspect it was more like a pounding Julia heard. As she opens the door , she comes face to face with Eli Cayne, also known as a US Marshall. There has been a hit put on her life and she must go with Eli to a safe house. This must have been hard to decipher for Julia. After all she is still trying to recover from a horrible crime committed against her. Because of the injuries she sustained during that brutal attack, she can't remember much about the incident. What must it be like to know something horrible happened to you, yet you can't put the puzzle together? I loved Julia instantly. She was gutsy, tough and a little apprehensive of others. I believe she was well written and made the story so realistic. She works as a pediatric nurse and her compassion for her patients were so genuine. This new threat to her life is something she has to face and will have to learn to trust Eli. Will she learn to trust Eli? Eli is a very strong character and will do anything to keep Julia safe. Will her memory cone back so she can help the police figure out who wants her dead? Eli is always close by and I loved his protectiveness towards her. I loved the references to their faith in the story. It was gentle little reminders that they were trusting God to see them through the situation they were in. The story starts with a bang and never slows down. Now they must figure out who the \"Hangman\" is and stop him or her before another death happens. I loved that there were several suspects which made the story so intriguing. With the medical terminology in the book, I appreciated the research went into the story. The author has once again written a story that gives me chills and keeps me turning pages as fast as I can. Get ready for an intense story that will have readers following Julia and Eli as they try to keep one step ahead of the \"Hangman.\" The ending is so compelling and action packed I didn't want it to end.
