I really think that I enjoyed this one a little more by going the audio route. The narrator is absolutely perfect for this series and really makes the story incredibly entertaining. This was a story that I really looked forward to listening to and proceeded to do so every chance that I could. One of the things that I loved about the first book in the series was being with Angel as she discovered what she was and learning to live with it. In this book, Angel knows exactly who she is and not only accepts it but has embraced her new reality. I still really like Angel a lot. She wants to be a better person and tries really hard to be the absolute best that she can at her job. She even seems to accept the fact that people will judge her based on her prior actions and doesn't hold it against them.When a body under her care is stolen from her at gunpoint, Angel becomes the focus of suspicion at the job that she loves. To clear her name, she does a little investigating and is eventually pulled into a much more sinister organization. She finds herself in a very dangerous situation and is forced to make horrible decisions. There is a pretty interesting mystery at the center of this story. During the course of the story, we also get to learn a little more about the science behind zombies in this world. I liked that Angel really stood up for herself in this story and simply refused to be accept being treated poorly in any way. She really doesn't take a lot of crap from anyone in this story but she still shows that she has a softer side and cares about others.Allison McLemore does a fabulous job with the narration of this story. In my mind, her voice is Angel's. I love her southern accent and the way she delivers the story. It was always clear to me who was speaking and I just found myself being carried away by the story. I felt like I was right there with Angel at times and really felt her range of emotions. I definitely plan to listen to more work from this narrator.I would highly recommend this book. This is the second book in the series and is really best read in order since there are some parts of the story that are brought from the first book. I can't wait to start the next book in this fun series!Initial ThoughtsI didn't like this one quite as much as I liked the first book in the series but I did enjoy my time listening to it. The narrator of this series is an absolutely perfect match for Angel."}, {"userName": "Sh3lly \u2694 tired of damaged heroines \u2694", "userReviewDate": "Jul 07, 2015", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/25393430-sh3lly-tired-of-damaged-heroines", "userReview": "This is book two of the series and while I happily (and maybe a bit generously) 5-starred the first one, this was just really disappointing. I was so excited to read this since I loved the first one so much, but the first 60% of this was dreadfully boring and then I started skimming. The humor wasn't there. It also just isn't as interesting now that Angel is a zombie and eats her brains mixed with stir fry or as toppings on pizza and stuff. It's too neat and tidy.This turned into basically an investigative urban fantasy that seemed more paranormal chick-lit to me. The mystery wasn't interesting until the big final reveal and battle at the end. Angel isn't even \"white trash\" anymore. I mean, come on!The ending was good and had some suspenseful scenes, but the whole first half of the book was a snoozefest and hard to get into. I don't know if I will be continuing with this series. The romantic interest is bland and there's nothing outstanding about any of the supporting characters either. I can appreciate that Angel is growing and trying to better herself, but it sucked most of the funny out of the story, in my view.Meh.Buddy read with the MacHalo group starting August 7, 2015.

I fully expected this book to be just as awesome but unfortunately it ended up falling a little flat which was really disappointing.One of the best things about My Life As A White Trash Zombie was the humour but somehow much of that seemed missing in the sequel. It's really hard to put my finger on exactly why I stopped finding Angel amusing but I think it was possibly the fact that she had completely turned her life around so quickly. I loved that she was working so hard to improve her life but it seemed like she had managed to get herself sorted out far too quickly and put her roots more or less completely behind her in a lot of ways. I also missed the blood, guts and brains from the first book (something I NEVER expected to find myself saying!), yes Angel still has to eat brains to survive but it was much more mundane here as she mixed it in with normal everyday food before eating it.I think I was most disappointed by the direction things took between her and Marcus though. At the end of the previous couple they had just started to get to know each other properly and were beginning to date but here their relationship seemed to have jumped forward at the speed of light and they were practically living together. I could have dealt with that if it hadn't been for the way Marcus was so completely and utterly dismissive of Angel whenever she tried to ask his advice or tell him her suspicions about what was going on. It seemed completely out of character for him to act like that, especially considering the way he treated her in the first book. I'm not a fan of characters who keep secrets for no apparent reason and it puts other people in danger because they don't have all the information they need to stay safe and there was more than one occasion when I really wanted to reach into the book and slap some sense into Marcus.The beginning of the book was a little on the slow side but things really picked up pace in the second half and in spite of the issues I had with Marcus I did find myself starting to enjoy the story much more. I may have been a little disappointed with this instalment but I loved the first book enough to give the series another chance. I just hope Diana Rowland manages to bring the magic back in White Trash Zombie Apocalypse."}, {"userName": "Carol.

Fast or slow, no matter; it\u2019s the survival/contagion aspect that fascinates me. How else is a hypochondriac supposed to enjoy a disease apocalypse without worrying it could become real? But Diana Rowland has created an unusual take on zombies with her \u201cWhite Trash Zombie\u201d series featuring a high school dropout who recently discovered she has an unavoidable craving for brains. While it\u2019s definitely escapist entertainment, the unpredictable plotting and an unusual narrator elevate it above average.Since the day Angel woke up in a hospital room with a mysterious note and a six-pack of strangely energizing smoothies, her life has undergone a complete change. A purposeless drug addict before the change, zombiism has cured her of drug cravings and mind-numbing highs. (Downside: a need for brains). A mysterious benefactor connects her with a position in the county morgue, Angel begins a new life, so to speak: a job where her skills are valued, a group of colleagues that appreciate her and\u2013finally\u2013a sense of self-esteem.

Book Info: Genre: Urban Fantasy/Zombies Reading Level: Adult My Thoughts: I really loved the first book in this series, My Life as a White Trash Zombie; it completely changed the idea of zombies, and my thinking about them as well. Angel is a wonderful character, and I\u2019ve been looking forward to this book with eager anticipation. I\u2019m also looking forward to next year\u2019s next book in the series, White Trash Zombie Apocalypse. And from the events in this book, I think it\u2019s going to be epic!This plot continues on shortly after the events at the end of book 1. Angel thought they had solved their zombie hunter problem when they ran off Ed (despite some lingering doubts that he did leave \u2013 maybe he\u2019s still around? They don\u2019t know), and now weird events are haunting Angel again. Angel is one urban-fantasy heroine who deserves to have a low self-esteem; she\u2019s had a hard life. Her anxiety at meeting Marcus\u2019s uncle and his rich and powerful friends was completely understandable, and Uncle Pietro is actually rather a jerk in his smug self-complacency when she first meets him. Since Marcus, and his folks, are so nice, that rather surprised me. Then again, Marcus is really quite weak-willed \u2013 he\u2019s nice, but he\u2019s not willing to stand up for himself, or for Angel when it matters, and that makes me like him a little less. When Pietro talks down to Angel at his party and Marcus just sits there, I wanted to smack him. Fortunately they do redeem themselves, but I don\u2019t want to add too many spoilers, so I\u2019ll leave it at that.I am loving Ben Roth more and more \u2013 he\u2019s the only member of the sheriff\u2019s department who treats Angel really well. We also learn some interesting facts about him in this book that made me admire him \u2013 but I\u2019m not gonna tell you! I\u2019ve given too many minor spoilers already! Speaking of nifty things we learn in this book, we also get a great lesson in Zombie Biology 101 and learn the theory behind why zombies exist in this universe, as well as exactly how zombies are made \u2013 and it\u2019s not at all as easy as in traditional zombie literature. Very cool stuff.All in all this is a wonderful follow-up in the White Trash Zombie series \u2013 even if you are not a fan of zombie literature, I think you will enjoy this unique and nontraditional take on zombie lore, and I think Angel is a zombie that anyone can love. Highly recommended for all fans of urban fantasy!Disclosure: I purchased this book for myself, as a birthday present; I\u2019m under no obligation to anyone, but I wanted to read something fun, something that I wanted to read, and I\u2019m always happy to provide an honest review.Synopsis: Angel Crawford is finally starting to get used to life as a brain-eating zombie, but her problems are far from over. Her felony record is coming back to haunt her, more zombie hunters are popping up, and she's beginning to wonder if her hunky cop-boyfriend is involved with the zombie mafia. Yeah, that's right - the zombie mafia.\u00a0Throw in a secret lab and a lot of conspiracy, and Angel's going to need all of her brainpower \u2013 and maybe a brain smoothie as well \u2013 in order to get through it without falling apart."}, {"userName": "Jennifer (Jen/The Tolkien Gal)", "userReviewDate": "Feb 22, 2018", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/4919283-jennifer-jen-the-tolkien-gal", "userReview": "3 starsThis book was a bit bloody long of a slow start. The first half of the book consisted of set-up and fleshing out of characters. I don't mind either of these - but an author has to learn how to balance these with plot. The overall story felt more like a White Trash 1.5 than a direct sequel.Angel Crawford, one of the better urban fantasy protagonists of recent years, has become somewhat of a self-employed detective (along with her usual job as a morgue assistant and zombie) in this installment. Everything starts to get hairy when someone holds her at gunpoint to steal a corpse. As she continues her investigation, a lot of loose ends with no apparent connections keep popping up. Angel takes it upon herself to get to the bottom of this because her useless love interest is blind as well as being boring (but we'll get to that point later). What I did enjoy about this book was how many elements, choices and happenings of the previous installment had consequences that featured in this book. Any book with a good set-up and pay-off system makes me happy to read the rest of the series. But somehow Marcus, our plank of a boyfriend, ruined this book for me.Angel has definitely experienced some character development. So has every other character, however minor. I love that minor characters are so well fleshed-out and are just seeping with backstory and humour. Now you'd think an author this fantastic at character development would be able to create a well-rounded and fallible love interest. If the only personality traits a character has are 1) Hot bod2) Never listens to what his girlfriend is trying to tell him.3) Dismisses girlfriendThen wouldn't you be frustrated as a reader?There are so many wonderful characters whom Angel has chemistry with. Durrell, her gentle giant, ex-basketball player partner or Nick, the grumpy but ultimately mushy-on-the-inside med student who helps out with autopsies. But no - the author decides that Angel belongs with a spoon. Not even a spoon - a spoon has depth. Marcus is an ice-cream stick because all he does is try to be in something sweet. Luckily this isn't a romance novel and Angel isn't a Mary-Sue, or I would have returned this book to Audible look ago. She tells Marcus off when he holds her back, using her trademark Southern drawl and sassy humour. I still enjoy Angel as a character and I'll definitely be picking up the next book in the series. I'm just hoping that time precious pages won't be wasted on a boring love interest and lackluster plot. As always, please check out the audio. The narrator does a fantastic job at portraying Angel. She has a beautiful range of voices that cover the quirkiest and most gentle friend to the most psychopathic villain.Edit:Review to come this weekend (as well as my other reviews) because I'm swamped with workP.S.

There are so many different aspects of the story I enjoyed that initially I couldn't figure out how to begin my review.Now that I've had a few days to reflect on it, I'm going to start with what impressed me most - Angel's character growth. This is a large focus of the story and is executed perfectly, written in a way that feels realistic and believable. If I didn't think I could become any more invested in Angel's character and the overall outcome of her story, I was proven wrong. Angel has had to make significant adjustments to the changes that have recently been made in her life. She's comfortable with her job at the coroner's office, is in a steady relationship with Marcus, and finally has people in her life who are willing to support her. She's also attempting to slowly mend the relationship with her father. He's still struggling with his alcoholism and despite what he's put her through, she's trying to remain supportive and refuses to give up on him. \"Because it's a goddamn bar!\" he shouted back. \"And I'm trying to not go to bars any more, 'cause when I go to bars I drink, and I'm trying not to drink any more 'cause it's pretty much the only way to get sober, goddammit!\"As the story progresses, Angel's insecurities and feelings of inadequacy become more evident, especially after she accompanies Marcus to a social gathering and meets his successful, well-educated friends and family members. Shortly after, their relationship becomes less stable when Angel decides she is fed up with the way he makes decisions for her as if she isn't smart enough or capable enough to think for herself.My first thought was that this was a plot device created just for the excitement of having tension in their relationship. And I think that most of you would agree that 99.9% of the time I would be correct. While I won't comment on their relationship status at the story's conclusion (you'll have to read to find out), I will say that I couldn't have been more proud of Angel for wanting to make improvements in her life and thinking more seriously about furthering her education solely for herself and not to impress someone else. She didn't feel the need to make decisions based on what would make someone else happy and didn't spend time sullen and whining about whether or not her relationship could be mended. It was very refreshing and empowering and is another reason for me to admire Rowland and the fantastic character and series that she has created.Another highlight of this sequel was the dark humor. 'Laugh out loud' is not just an expression, but a literal term when reading this story. Granted, the moments with the most humor appear in the later half of the story, but once it starts it's hilarious. And most of these moments occur during intense scenes, especially when Angel interacts with the \"bad guy\", making them that much funnier for their inappropriate timing.\"My sidekick?\" I gave Ed a sidelong look.\"Yes, the knight in shining armor who rescued you from my dastardly clutches.\" \"Dude, you read way too many romance novels.\"I also found myself very impressed by the scientific explanation for zombies. Rowland provides a creative and unique concept for their creation and continued existence. It completely changed the way that I looked at Angel's fast healing and craving for brains.Overall, this is a series that I very highly recommend to fans of dark urban fantasy and flawed characters. The unbelievably kick ass book covers are just an added bonus. \"Yeah, well I ate his brain.\" I leaned back and laced my fingers behind my head. \"Motherfucker shot me. I couldn't let that shit slide.\""}, {"userName": "Becky", "userReviewDate": "Oct 30, 2013", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/1376766-becky", "userReview": "This was a pretty decent follow up to the first book. I can't say that I enjoyed this one QUITE as much as the first one. There was a lot of repetitive stuff and recapping (which I may have noticed more because I was reading, or listening, to them back to back), and Angel's reactions to things just seemed a little strange and over-reactive, making certain situations seem a little off to me. For instance, the scene where Angel is brought to Marcus's uncle's house for a party, she understandably freaks out when told that it's not just the uncle she'll be meeting, but his ENTIRE extended family and family friends. (I'd be a little pissed to find that out right before getting out of the car as well.) But then when she meets his mom and dad, they are nice, but to me, seemed a little cold and highbrow-distant. Angel loved them though, so that's cool. Moving on to Sofia (Sophia?), the conversation was a little awkward, but I didn't get that there was any outright dislike, so later conversations regarding how their first meeting was so antagonistic and that Angel was surprised that Sof/phia would call her seemed strange, considering that they left things on a REASONABLY positive, if a bit forced, note. And then there's the uncle Pietro, who seemed more like he was talking to someone who just didn't really know how things worked (which was kinda true) and that didn't really give him much reason to have faith in them on first meeting (also true), but she reacted as though he was actively trying to ruin her life or something. I can't really go into much more because of reasons, but it just seemed off. Maybe he really didn't like her, but based on their ACTUAL conversation, I didn't get much more than that. She seemed to, though. Otherwise, it was pretty decent, and I liked Angel's growth and how some of the plot has evolved. I like the reason and explanation given for there being zombies, and I like the rules of the situation. They make sense and it's still interesting to learn more as we go. I'm definitely looking forward to the next book."}, {"userName": "Catherine", "userReviewDate": "Aug 13, 2015", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/7411485-catherine", "userReview": "I liked it...in the end.

Until, that is, some weird shit starts happening and a body is stolen on her watch. Turns out there\u2019s a whole lot more going on in the zombie community than Angel could\u2019ve imagined.This was exciting and completely held my attention. Believe me, this isn\u2019t an easy thing with audiobooks. The whole mystery surrounding the stolen body was really good. There\u2019s a hellava lot more to it than just a stolen body, but you know, spoilers. It does get us deeper into the world building and I love it.I adore all of the characters, but of course, Angel tops them all. The character growth in her is fantastic. She can be such a smartass, and her foul mouth is pretty damn funny. But what I love the best, is how she has developed a higher respect for life and is taking steps to improve herself. She\u2019s very clever and way smarter than she thought, definitely proving she\u2019s not one to be underestimated.I truly enjoy the secondary characters and Angel\u2019s different relationship dynamics with them. Even Nick the prick has his moments. I especially love Dr. LaBlanc, the pathologist. He\u2019s become an amazing mentor to Angel, and the way he encourages her gets me a little choked up.

Toss in her probation officer, a secretive boyfriend, and an over zealous scientist and Angel knows she\u2019s going to need all the brains she can get her hands on if she\u2019s going to survive this time around.Even White Trash Zombies Get The Blues is a wickedly funny, action packed, urban fantasy with a healthy dollop of romance and suspense. A romantic suspense\u2026with zombies. I love Diana Rowland\u2019s Kara Gillan series and expected nothing but fantastic things in here as well. I wasn\u2019t disappointed. Rowland finds the perfect balance of macabre humor and realistic soul searching in here with heroine Angel Crawford. Angel was a complete screw up but when an accident turns her into a zombie, Angel grabs hold of her new found \u201clife\u201d with both hands. No longer compelled to try and self destruct, she has a great job and access to her much needed choice of food-brains. She has become more accepting of her condition, made friends, and she\u2019s dating the man who gave her a new lease on life, detective Marcus Ivanov.Angel still has self esteem issues though and I like that Rowland doesn\u2019t sweep those under the covers, making the zombie-ism a \u201ccure all\u201d. Angel is still cleaning up the aftermath from her arrest, she\u2019s on probation, and is also trying to repair the relationship with her father. Dating a hunk like Marcus isn\u2019t all rainbows and unicorns either. She sees the differences between her and Marcus, made glaringly apparent when she is introduced to his family and friends. There is also Marcus\u2019s attitude. He is beginning to make decisions for her without consulting her and the new Angel isn\u2019t going to put up with it. She may be white trash but she\u2019s not stupid white trash. I adore the mixture of vulnerability and steel that is readily apparent in her hilariously snarky dialogue. You can easily visualize the head rolling and finger snapping when Angel feels the need to put someone in their place. What I truly like about this series is the realism of it all. This isn\u2019t an urban fantasy about zombies\u2026it\u2019s a urban fantasy that just happens to have a heroine who is a zombie.The secondary characters are just as personable and well developed as Angel and only adds to the fun of this story. Angel\u2019s dad is making strides in here, along with Angel, and I enjoyed seeing her interaction with her friends. She\u2019s a good person and it\u2019s nice to see that validated by others. The mystery of the story is quite inventive as Ms. Rowland pulls from book one and builds upon that storyline to expand the world she has created. We learn more about the zombie-ism and the steps some are taking to make sure the food supply doesn\u2019t become overtaxed. Angel shows quite an aptitude for investigative work when she is unfairly penalized for a situation at the morgue and decides to take her future into her own hands and solve the mystery. A couple of shocking twists and turns makes for some wide-eyed moments. I look forward to seeing what going to happen in book three.Even White Trash Zombies Get The Blues is the perfect sequel to My LIfe As A White Trash Zombie and a must read for all fans of urban fantasy and zombies.

I don't get it, because in this book she clearly states how she can't even smoke because her parasite; (what makes her a zombie) has to use up her brains quicker to combat what damage the cigarettes are doing to her body. It's silly, I don't think it makes her look cooler because she's holding a cigarette. \u21ddSex Factor\u21dc None that is explicit, it's really not the focus of this book\u2026even the romance is dialed down and takes a back seat to the mystery."}, {"userName": "Ian", "userReviewDate": "Aug 23, 2012", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/6703235-ian", "userReview": "A Solid 4.5 StarsAfter being turned into a zombie in My Life as a White Trash Zombie, Angel returns for another adventure.

She's snarky, intelligent and determined. Those around her dismiss and belittle her but she always manages to land on her feet. Fans of Molly Harper's Jane Jameson / Half Moon Hollow series' will love these books. They are suffused with the same intelligent writing and lively sense of humor."}, {"userName": "SnoopyDoo's Book Reviews ", "userReviewDate": "Dec 14, 2016", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/17979808-snoopydoo-s-book-reviews", "userReview": "4 \u00bd \u2605This books just starts a few weeks where the last book ended and get us right back to Angel and her job and now new boyfriend.I really love Angel she is truly realistic down to earth has flaws and struggles but yet we love her as she is trying to better her life.I love that it takes her a while and she is not just perfect even though she not taking drugs anymore.

It is the perfect mix of bad-ass and vulnerable in a completely unexpected scene (are there any other books that feature a punk-chick on a toilet?*) The cover is so detailed that it begs examination and I found myself looking it over every time that I closed the book and noticing new things each time.The Gist: Angel Crawford is a zombie, but not the moaning, shambling type of zombie that drops body parts as it wanders the post apocalyptic world attacking survivors. As long as she keeps her stomach full up on brains, Angel is able to pass for any other trailer trash chick with a felony record and probation requirements to tend to. Because she doesn't have ENOUGH problems, Angel finds herself in the middle of a mystery that appears to involve a zombie mafia, secret lab and gruesome experiments.Review: I normally shy away from zombie books. I tend to find them predictable in the whole \"let me lull you into a false sense of security and then have zombies jump out of FUCKING EVERYWHERE\" kind of way. However, I really love Diana Rowland's take on zombies. These zombies only rot when they are deprived of brains, but can lose their humanity as the disease takes over and promotes survival without fear of consequences. They also take jobs that will ensure the availability of brains, like Angel's job in the morgue. The thought of zombies working amongst us while secretly downing brain smoothies for lunch, intrigues and amuses me in ways I never thought possible. The beginning of Even White Trash Zombies Get the Blues was a little slow. There is a lot of moaning as Angel tries to get her life together and laments her supposed inability to become part of polite society and make something of herself. She is the type of girl that you want to shake because you can see that she is smart and has a great deal of potential, she just needs to get out of her own way and let herself imagine a future that doesn't involve suffering for her past criminal activity, status as a high school drop out and white trash roots. Even through the whining, there are sparks of a stronger Angel and glimpses of bad-ass behavior. I loved Angel in the first book, and was really glad to see her getting her life together and (begrudgingly) start studying for her GED. As a character, her voice is fantastic. Witty, self-deprecating and all around total tough girl. She rarely takes shit from anyone, least of all the bad guys and proves that female characters can be scared out of their wits and still pull out a line that will leave the reader laughing.There are a number of supporting characters (interestingly, all men) who work on the periphery of the story but never outshine Angel. In this novel, she is the star and she is not willing to allow anyone else to coddle her, protect her or rescue her. I would like to see these characters further developed and given a bit more personality. For example, Angel's partner (the name escapes me at the moment) has some really great lines, but we barely see him. Ed and Pietro could also be really interesting characters if they were fleshed out a little more. While this novel was a little slow to start, it made up for it when the shit hit the fan. We were then treated to pretty much non-stop action in which we see Angel at her most vulnerable (and kudos to an author who can allow a kick-ass character to display that much vulnerability) and her most fearsome. The only thing that brought it down a notch was the serious info-dumping session that occurred afterwards. I understand that things needed to be explained and loose ends needed to be tied up, but the coffee klatch was a little much for me.One note on content. I really enjoy this series and sincerely wish that I could recommend it to my students. However, there is A LOT of swearing and it is widely varied in level of profanity (see below). There is no way I could hand this one off to a student without serious fear of being fired.

Of course, good things don't last and it's not long before Angel finds herself in bother again.After collecting the body of a security guard at a top research lab, Angel is held up at gunpoint at the morgue and told to hand over the body of the securiry guard. As there were no witnesses, Angel's bosses and the police think she's lying in order to cover up her own incompetence. With her job on the line, Angel investigates the lab and the security guard in the hope of clearing her name. Angel soon finds herself tangled up in top secret research, evil scientists, zombie soldiers, fake brains, zombie hunters and the zombie mafia.-I adore Angel's voice - she's so blunt, funny and truthful. She was likeable and easy to root for because she was a bit of an underdog. Even though she was insecure about her intelligence and qualifications, she didn't let it get her down. I loved that she wanted to improve herself and wanted to get an education and do something with her life so she could show everyone that she wasn't the loser they all thought she was. -Marcus and Angel have settled into their relationship and the cracks begin to show. Angel starts to resent how little faith Marcus has in her and she gets annoyed with him deciding everything for her. Thankfully Angel doesn't just let Marcus get away with his behaviour, she sticks up for herself and lets Marcus know what's what. I thought Marcus was great in the first book but not so much in this one. He was very irritating, particularly when it came to his uncle - he blindly listened to whatever his uncle said, never questioned him and and thought his uncle could do no wrong. Even when Angel bought up valid points in regards to his uncle's motives, he refused to listen to reason. I was glad that Angel told Marcus she wanted to slow down at the end, I think she still needs to sort things out in her life before committing to anyone. I wouldn't mind if Angel had a fling with Nick - there's definitely potential between them. -Angel's scenes with her dad were quite touching - he was trying his best to give up alcohol and rebuild a relationship with her. It was nice of Angel to give her dad another chance - she was very forgiving of his past treatment of her and I liked how she did her best to support him. She could have easily walked away from him and focused on her own life, since she didn't owe him anything but she still helped him.-It's disappointing how every single person in Angel's life is male - her dad, Marcus, her boss and colleagues. Why can't more heroines have well written female friends/family that are important to the heroine??-It was a bit convenient and hard to believe that Dr Charish ended up revealing all the details of her evil plot to Angel. Charish was obviously an intelligent and ambitious woman so for her to just tell Angel everything was unrealistic - obviously it was done for the benefit of the reader. I would have preferred if the truth about the zombie experiments were revealed in a more organic way instead of having a supposedly smart character just brag about it.-I liked how the author didn't shy away from describing how Angel rotted and decomposed when she didn't get enough brains to eat. I'd much rather read about a heroine and hero who's nails can fall off and who's skin can peel away instead of the usual perfect heroine and hero. -I was pissed that Angel didn't have much of a go at Pietro for betraying her. He's obviously old enough and smart enough to know what he was agreeing to in letting Angel be experimented on. I wish Marcus had disowned him, if his uncle was willing to use someone he cared about for his own purpose then he's not trustworthy. If Pietro doesn't redeem himself in the next book, I hope Angel takes him down.I'll definitely be reading the next book. I'm looking forward to seeing how Angel's character grows, how her relationship with her dad and Marcus develops and how she handles the zombie soldiers."}, {"userName": "\u2623Lynn\u2623", "userReviewDate": "Sep 20, 2017", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/7101656-lynn", "userReview": "So much better than the first book."}, {"userName": "Christen (GoldiloxReads and Whimsify)", "userReviewDate": "Oct 07, 2011", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/4652961-christen-goldiloxreads-and-whimsify", "userReview": "\". . . Sweet zombie Jesus, I was fucking invincible.\"Angel is back and as mouthy as ever in this sequel to last year's breakout hit, My Life As A White Trash Zombie. This one definitely has a bit of a different feel to it, with Rowland giving Angel some room to grow up. While the first book centered heavily on Angel learning about being a zombie, Even White Trash Zombies Get the Blues shows Angel getting to know herself as a person.The story picks up only a couple weeks after the end of the previous book, with the police department still in an uproar after discovering the identity of the serial killer and still trying to track him down. Angel is such a unique character, even in the world of urban fantasy. I mean, she's a ZOMBIE for goodness sake! She is also full of hilarious one-liners that always make me snort.\"'Yeah, well I ate his brain.\" I leaned back and laced my fingers behind my head. \"Motherfucker shot me. I couldn't let that shit slide.'\"Angel has settled into her new life as a coroner's assistant quite nicely, actually a little too nicely if you ask me. It is clear that Rowland plans to let Angel mature over the course of the series and it seems we can look forward to seeing some good growth, yet I feel like I almost want her to do it a little more slowly. If this is going to be a long series (and I hope it is!) I want to see Angel's growth happen at a slightly slower pace. That must be my love of screwed up anti-heroines talking. I love a good messed up heroine and Angel definitely fits into that category.\"'Thing is, you're right. I don't have shit in the way of education. I had a crap family life, and there was no one to tell me to finish school and go on to college or any of that stuff. And there sure as hell wasn't anyone to help pay for it. But it doesn't matter. I'm working to improve myself, And I don't need anyone telling me that I need to do it. Just me.' And my probation officer. but I didn't plan on adding that little detail.\"At the end of the previous book, we learned that Marcus, the police detective Angel had been interested in, was actually a zombie as well. The book ended with the two of them kind of becoming a couple and I was interested in seeing where their relationship would go. I was a little disappointed that in this book, Marcus is kind of a douche. Can't sugar coat it - he was not my favorite person. He is constantly second guessing everything Angel says and thinks and treats her like a little kid. What I was impressed with was how Angel handled him. She stuck up for herself and didn't let Marcus' lack of faith in her convince her she was wrong.In Even White Trash Zombies Get the Blues, we finally get to learn more about what makes someone a zombie and how it works. Rowland created a fascinating story behind her zombies and it was certainly distinct, even believable. We also learn about a zombie network (read: mob) with Marcus' uncle at its head. I'm hoping this means that we will get to meet other zombies in future books. My wish for Angel is a female friend, perhaps even a zombie? She needs a sounding board and good friend, that's something that is noticeably missing from her life. All the other characters in the books that mean something to Angel are all men - she needs a chick to roll with her and be a bit of a role model for her.Oh, and there are some gross-out moments in this book, that's for sure. But they are nothing an avid reader of urban fantasy can't handle and less than an avid reader of zombie fiction would expect.I'm excited to see where this series goes and what's in store for Angel in the future. Hopefully we won't have to wait until next year for book three!\"'Zombie Super Powers, activate, you fucking bitches.'\"Recommended for fans of: screwed up heroines, zombies, fingernails falling off, every swear word under the sun, and books with snark."}, {"userName": "Michael (Mai)", "userReviewDate": "Jun 22, 2015", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/1884422-michael-mai", "userReview": "Why I listened to this: Why wouldn\u2019t I? I absolutely loved White Trash Zombie. It\u2019s my favorite book of 2015 so far. I also love Allison McLemore. She is an amazing narrator and really captures Angel\u2019s essence with her performance.What I thought: First off, I was terrified of reading this. Recently, every time I read a book two in a series that I love, I become completely devastated. Second installments murder so many of the series that I like. Not this one. Not my Angel Crawford. She lives up to book one and wins me over even more.Angel has had a shit life. Just when she\u2019s finally getting it back together, despite being a zombie, the world tries to run her over again. But does she take it laying down? Hell no! She fights back and becomes an even better person for it.Angel is a quality human being, or rather, zombie. Because of the environment I grew up in, I can relate to Angel. The way she\u2019s written, I believe anyone who grew up trashy can find a fictional friend in her. She\u2019s just so resilient despite being handed the shittiest lot in life.Besides being this awesome series about zombies, it\u2019s also about someone finding their self-worth. Angel is now learning from her mistakes and realizes what a gift she was given when she was turned into a zombie. She is grateful for it but doesn\u2019t want to rely on the person that made her a zombie to fix everything for her. She doesn\u2019t just run to her big, cop boyfriend to turn everything into peaches and rainbows. She\u2019s her own person but has mind enough to lean on others when she can\u2019t accomplish something by herself. But the important part about Angel is she fights for herself.Great book. I highly recommend this series. It\u2019s quality content. It\u2019s funny and the author\u2019s voice is original."}, {"userName": "Jeann (Happy Indulgence) ", "userReviewDate": "May 19, 2015", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/6186603-jeann-happy-indulgence", "userReview": "I've binge read this series in the last two days. The writing is just so easy to get into! While Angel Crawford was more down on herself in the first book, she's come a long way since being turned into a zombie. I loved seeing elements of her character's vulnerability and self deprecation, mixing with the confidence in knowing that she cares for others and that she's more human than others. Angel really does kick ass in this installment, and there are some fantastic action scenes that she experiences.I did get the feeling here that the zombies are much like vampires though, with how they turn people into other zombies who have super healing when they're juiced up. Just swap in blood with brains and you've pretty much got the concept. What makes the White Trash Zombie series different however, is the morgue, the scientific experiments, the murder mystery aspect in each installment and Angel's witty, lovable white trash self. It's a fantastic combination. I also loved seeing Angel's relationship with her abusive dad evolve, although he's done some bad things that are unforgivable, at the end of the day he loves her, and they're trying hard together. Another fantastic installment in the White Trash Zombie series, and I couldn't recommend it enough!

Rowland added more depth, new characters and more complication for our girl. Rowland creates a tight tale and the more time I spend in this world the happier I am. The flow is wonderful and I am able to slip right into the story. This is an audio series where I look for excuses to listen and find myself listening for \"just another chapter\" late into the night.

As much as I enjoyed EVEN WHITE TRASH ZOMBIES GET THE BLUES, I couldn\u2019t help but feel a twinge of disappointment after the high I had experienced with the first novel. The zombie 101 elements that were prevalent in the earlier installment were mostly absent and this series\u2019 story arc went from a slow lope to warped speed far too quickly. I still loved listening to Angel\u2019s zombie shenanigans and I\u2019ll definitely be buying the next book although, I am going to wait a bit longer to do that than last time.The main character and Allison McLemore\u2019s narration are the two main factors that keep me coming back for more. Angel is an incredibly unique and wildly entertaining heroine who I seriously just can\u2019t get enough of. I love her snarky personality and her hilarious zombie vocabulary. It\u2019s impossible not to giggle when she talks about tanking up or when she yells \u201czombie powers ACTIVATE!\u201d I like how even though Crawford\u2019s a newbie in this world she\u2019s not afraid to throw her weight around, even when she\u2019s up against some pretty heavy hitters. McLemore continues to wow me with her humorous portrayal of Angel and, I know that I\u2019ve said this already but, I could listen to her southern twang all day long.As much as I enjoyed this book\u2019s plot, I did think that Rowland went a little overboard. Things just got a whole lot more complicated in the WHITE TRASH ZOMBIES universe and I\u2019m not convinced that the author gave readers enough time to catch-up. I understand that she wanted to deliver an action-packed installment but I wish there\u2019d been more of a transition from zombie 101 to full-on mafia war / government conspiracy. Also, most of the new developments in relation to Angel\u2019s walking dead status were instinctual which made them less entertaining to read about because of the lack of the need for trial and error. I\u2019m hoping things will have evened out by the third novel.I\u2019m still not sure how I feel about the romance between the two main protagonists. There were definitely a couple of cute moments between them and I liked learning how zombie relationships differ from human ones; like for instance, at one point Angel gives Marcus crap for not telling her sooner that she was beginning to smell. And, not like B.O. either but rotten flesh. Yuck. Ivanov had a stick stuck up his butt for a good part of this book but I began to warm-up to him towards the end when he seemed to realize that he had to get off his high horse if he wanted to continue dating Crawford.EVEN WHITE TRASH ZOMBIES GET THE BLUES is another fun listen from Diana Rowland and Allison McLemore; definitely worth checking out if you like your snark with a side of brains."}, {"userName": "Shy The WidowMaker", "userReviewDate": "Jun 19, 2013", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/5713324-shy-the-widowmaker", "userReview": "Ok this is another one that listened to on audio. I have come to learn that this is the only way I want to read this series as the narrator is really amazing to me. We pick this book up with Angel continuing to adjust to life as a zombie. She is still working and surviving and just being Angel really. I think one of the main reasons I love this series is Angel. She is really just the average girl that caught a bad break and is now trying to turn her life around. I love seeing her continue to grow and learn more about herself in the process. Angel is dating Marcus and I have to say that I didn't care for him this time around at all. He was way too controlling and patronizing. I loved that Angel stood her ground against him and didn't just let him boss her around. Angel being Angel stumbles upon a mystery one day after she is robbed at gunpoint for a body.Of course she doesn't chalk it up as just a random body stealing and decides to investigate. The investigation takes her further into the world of zombies and she learns some interesting information about this world. It may be more than she wanted to know because she finds out there is a huge conspiracy going on. Of course Angel has the help of some of friends to crack the mystery. I think I loved this one more this time around because Angel knows she has faults but she admits them and moves on and doesn't dwell on them. You can tell there are some people that can't look past who she used to be but she doesn't let that stop her at all. I loved that about her the most. She is who she is and what you see if what you get plain and simple.Overall this was another great listen and I loved it. I already preordered the next audio in the series because I have to see what will happen next in Angel's world. I love the author's writing style and how she knows how to draw you into this world and keep you there. I love the narrator too and think she does a good job with Angel and her voice is just what I would expect Angel to sound like. She uses all the right tones and inflections to make me feel like I am right in the story.
