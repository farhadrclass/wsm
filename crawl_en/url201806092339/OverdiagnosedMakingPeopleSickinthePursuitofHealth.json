The idea that it\u2019s beneficial that we subject ourselves to tests and screenings, which are judged based on sometimes arbitrarily-set numerical criteria, only to look for problems that do not yet exist or have not shown up yet as symptoms is a pseudo-scientific hoax that is promulgated by those who want to sell you tests and screenings and medications and \u201cpreventive\u201d treatments, and is unfortunately left unopposed by doctors, many of whom are aware of the lack of any real scientific evidence to support the advantages of \u201cearly aggressive treatment,\u201d but are too afraid of medical lawsuits to say no to their overzealous and paranoid patients who have become confused by the unrelenting demands of the healthcare industry for more tests and screenings. (Wow, that was a long sentence.) This is a well-researched and well-presented book. It shows how the criteria for many diseases are arbitrarily set, and how the results of various studies are manipulated to mislead the general population to believe that it\u2019s a good idea to get tested for all sorts of possible illnesses. Unfortunately many doctors have fallen for this myth too. (Not to offend any physicians out there, but most doctors are not scientists, and many of them have never designed or conducted a scientific experiment and don\u2019t really know how to read the results of a large study and scrutinize its methods and check its claims and results. People need to keep this fact in mind before blindly following whatever their doctors tell them.) The reality is that even in the case of serious diseases like breast and prostate cancer, there\u2019s really no evidence showing that it\u2019s of any value for the younger and healthy people to undergo screening to look for these common cancer types early. The moral of the book is: 1) If you feel fine, assume you\u2019re fine. Don\u2019t go looking for problems. 2) If you read an ad or see something on TV that tells you that early testing and screening \u201csaves lives,\u201d you can ignore it unless you\u2019re good with statistics and are willing to pore over their study methodology and actual results and judge for yourself."}, {"userName": "Meredith", "userReviewDate": "Mar 04, 2011", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/1560497-meredith", "userReview": "Overdiagnosed: Making People Sick in the Pursuit of Health challenges the current mindset that it's always desirable and beneficial to obsessively screen healthy people for potential illnesses. Dr. Welch describes how actively pursuing illness in healthy people can actually be harmful to the patient. Why is it bad to discover that people have diseases they don't know about and that have yet to create any symptoms? A few reasons are:1) The medical-industrial complex continually lowers the numbers to give people more diseases.2) Treating patients on the mild or borderline end of the disease spectrum often causes more harm than good.3) The side effects of the treatments for patients with mild to moderate forms of a disease can be worse (and cause more discomfort and disruption) than the actual disease especially if they are asymptomatic.4) Most people have \"abnormalities\" that would never cause them problems and are only diagnosed thanks to advanced medical imagining technologies. 5) There is the very real risk of false positives, causing patients to be treated for things such as prostate and thyroid cancer that they never actually had. This is not only expensive but can cause lasting harm in addition to the negative effects of the treatment.6) Some abnormalities that are technically classified as cancers are genetically destined never to progress or cause a person symptoms.7) Due a patient's age or other medical conditions, s/he will die of something else for the cancer progressed enough to cause symptoms or discomfort. So, diagnosing and treating them will not benefit the patient. In fact, it will only harm them emotionally, financially, and physically.8) Rapid growing cancers that are also often resistant to treatment frequently are not caught by annual (or continual) preventive screenings because they develop so rapidly and can appear between screenings.9) Actively searching for disease in asymptomatic patients further strains an already overburdened medical system.10) The discovery of pre-existing conditions can result in the loss of medical insurance and the refusal for insurance companies to cover the costs of treatment.11) The potential benefit of treatment commonly falls short of the actual benefit by a significant amount.12) Many of the motives behind the push for preventative screens are not altruistic (i.e. motivating factors include profit and fear of lawsuits).13) Patients are often encouraged to seek preventative screenings based on personal anecdotes rather than solid medical facts.And the list goes on . . . Chapter 1 discusses high blood pressure.Chapter 2 discusses diabetes, high cholesterol, and osteoporosis.Chapter 3 discusses medical imaging and the myriad of conditions such as bulging discs, blood clots, abdominal aortic aneurysms, damaged cartilage and gallstones that are often discovered when testing for other conditions.Chapter 4 discusses prostate cancer, including the author's own reasons behind opting out of screening for it.Chapter 5 discusses other cancers such as thyroid and colon cancer.Chapter 6 discusses breast cancer.Chapter 7 discusses \"incidentalomas\" that might or might not be cancerous. Chapter 8 discusses other screenings such as cardiograms and ultrasounds.Chapter 9 discusses genetic testing to determine if patients have elevated risks of developing certain diseases.Chapter 10 is the author's conclusion. The author's conclusion is not to avoid screening and medical treatments resulting from a positive test. Instead he councils patients to weigh the negative outcomes against any potential benefits before choosing to be screened. He also encourages patients to give careful consideration before consenting to treatment for any asymptomatic \"abnormality\" discovered when testing for other complaints. The epidemic of overdiagnosis makes for an interesting albeit disturbing read. The statistics and charts occasionally make for dry reading, but overall the writing is accessible to all of us ordinary consumers of medical services."}, {"userName": "A.", "userReviewDate": "Apr 24, 2011", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/5174097-a", "userReview": "This book is a lot better and more accurate than you would think. I happened upon it at the library. After looking at it for a week I was super bored and read it. Could not put it down! It explains how diagnostic tests have shifted (high cholesterol is now 200 and over where before it was 240 and over) after studies (paid for by drug companies-often) determined a lower threshold was needed. It also discusses how if you get enough tests you are bound to find something and that sometimes the treatment itself will cause more problems than if you left well enough alone. This is not a crazy book by some holistic weirdo. It is by a doctor whose wife actually had an aggressive form of breast cancer (not pertinant but puts it in perspective). Anyway, I was wary of reading it and it is a good and factual book. I highly recommend it to anyone who is old enough that doctors start recommending you get this test and that. Interestingly, it does tell you some tests (like colonoscopy) are very valid and important but others are bunk for 99% of the people who take them. I learned some useful stuff and no longer feel guilt over skipping the last 3 years of mammograms."}, {"userName": "Sally", "userReviewDate": "May 07, 2012", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/746637-sally", "userReview": "A very clear, well-reasoned, reader friendly, evidence-based argument for the view that preemptively hunting for health problems in asymptomatic people through routine screenings and tests, and lowering diagnostic thresholds (as has been done with high blood pressure, cholesterol, and diabetes), is not in the best interests of the vast majority of people. Many such early-intervention strategies do not lower the number of deaths from those diseases, result in false positives and overtreatment, and leave healthy people anxious, feeling that they are unwell, and sometimes financially burdened. They drive up the cost of medical care and insurance without giving bottom-line benefits, and may initiate unnecessary interventions, sometimes a whole cascade of potentially harmful treatments. The need is for authoritative medical trials to evaluate which screenings and treatments are effective, and which are ineffective or harmful. However, even when such trials show that a type of early detection is harmful, useless, or helps only a miniscule number of people, it is hard to change entrenched views of the medical industry or of the public."}, {"userName": "David Quinn", "userReviewDate": "Jul 24, 2016", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/4968643-david-quinn", "userReview": "More than 35 years ago my father died, too young, from pancreatic cancer. I learned at a young age that there were benign tumors and malignant tumors but I've always held the belief that if I have cancer in my body I want it removed. And sooner rather than later. And I would want to know as soon as possible. Over the years I've heard that there were controversies about screening for and treating prostate and breast cancer. (These are discussed in the book and presented very well.) Who wouldn't want to know if they have these cancers and why wouldn't they opt for prostatectomies or mastectomies?While I approached this book with a reservoir of skepticism I was also willing to keep an open mind. I have to say the author's use of plain language, patient stories and statistical data are extremely persuasive in arguing against routine screenings (PSA tests, mammograms and the like) and early surgical/medical interventions when symptoms are lacking. To be sure, the author (a physician) isn't saying you should stay away from doctors or ignore symptoms when the warning signs are visible.Overall this is a very good book and one I would recommend to everyone."}, {"userName": "Joan", "userReviewDate": "Sep 10, 2013", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/3837733-joan", "userReview": "I found myself feeling dubious about some of the claims. I also found myself wishing for more detail. Basically, the concept is that doing hunting expeditions for diseases isn't a good idea. He is all for what he calls diagnostic screening: if the patient goes to the doctor with a lump or something. He is very opposed to screening being done routinely and explains why in convincing detail. I'm just not completely convinced. My father in law was diagnosed with colon cancer after getting a toilet bowl of blood. Colon cancer is 95% fatal in 4th stage. In 1st stage it is 95% curable. I think it quite likely my father in law might be alive today if he had ever had routine screening for this. Dr. Welch's point would be that a lot of unnecessary polyps might be removed from the screening. The main argument Dr. Welch has against regular screening is that so often it is a case of over diagnosis and the consequences are frequently worse than just doing nothing would have been. In other words, ignorance can be bliss. I can't disagree with him completely by any means. I found myself running to check my numbers for cholesterol and blood pressure on the health company website. I've been getting some pressure to both go on high blood pressure meds and cholesterol meds. According to Dr. Welch, my numbers are actually fairly low which isn't the impression I've gotten from the organization. My feeling had been all along that I wasn't so sure I wanted to do this and now I am sure I do not want to start meds until and if my numbers are considerably higher. Basically, the concept is that the cure can be worse than the disease. A lot of this of course is fear of lawsuits. As the Dr. pointed out, Drs never get sued for suggesting tests. They get sued for not suggesting tests. I would say that the answer as always is more education. The patient needs to decide if the possible result of screening is something they wish to do or not, and why. The Dr was after my Dad for years to get his cholesterol tested and my Dad always refused to her great frustration. He died from liver problems that had nothing to do with cholesterol issues. So ultimately my Dad was right for him. Did I mention he was 89 at death? Even if it had been cholesterol that killed him, would it have been such a tragedy at his age as opposed to suffering the side effects of statins for decades? I just don't know. I plan on seeing if the doctor has a website with more detail. I also think that my ordinary skepticism in dealing with doctors is justified by this book. I want reasons for why I should do something. Don't just tell me to take a test without explaining all about the possible consequences."}, {"userName": "Jodi", "userReviewDate": "Apr 03, 2011", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/4093582-jodi", "userReview": "If you are interested in America's health care system, you should read this book. The authors are practicing physicians and bring both real world experience and an MD level understanding of clinical trials. We are moving from treating sick people that have definite symptoms to looking at healthy people with no symptoms in the hope that \"early detection\" will prevent sickness. With the advent of MRIs and CT scans, we are able to see much more than ever before. The cut offs for diagnosing high blood pressure and cholesterol keep getting lower. The problem is, doctors are not good at determining what will result in actual disease progression. For example, finding very small cancer clusters via MRI/CT does not mean you will die from that disease. Often, the cancer either does not progress or goes away on its own. Prostate cancer is grossly over treated. There is no need to get fetal ultrasounds or have fetal heart monitors. Genetic testing alone is not a reliable indicator of getting the disease either. The problem with all this testing is that people are over treated. They may get needless follow-up tests and interventions, which can often cause significant side effects, either short or long-term. People are more likely to suffer significant medication side effects when treating closer to normal values. And over treating makes no difference in life expectancy, but it will result in significant anxiety for the patient. There is little chance that any of what this author is proposing will be adopted. The forces are too great for the desire to make profit, for MDs to avoid lawsuits, and for the well meaning advocacy groups to stay relevant. Our society has been inundated with messages scaring us into thinking that early detection is best, although any statistics that may be used in supporting their view is often misrepresented. The only hope is if individuals decide to limit interventions. I am one of them."}, {"userName": "Mark", "userReviewDate": "Aug 24, 2017", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/1492668-mark", "userReview": "I've always liked technical papers that have a graphic in them that summarizes the whole paper. Dr. Welch and his coauthors' sobering look at over-diagnosis can be summarized with one graph that they present in the opening chapters:We've been screening for more and more in asymptomatic patients in the last 50 years, based on the premise that it would be better to catch things early and treat them. So, have patient outcomes improved? After several million people have been affected by this onslaught, the answer is no. Welch explains why and why it's often a bad idea to screen well people.I spent 35 years working in a hospital laboratory. Our relationship with the clinicians was usually cordial and sometimes actually cooperative, but now and then it was adversarial. Problems included how to deal with the request for an inappropriate test (tests that didn't really exist; tests that couldn't be controlled; tests that were incredibly expensive - but the clinician's attitude was that neither they nor the patient was paying for it, so...; tests whose results could not be interpreted; tests whose results could not help the patient no matter what the result was), how to explain that if every test were done \"stat\", then none of them would be, and how to explain that if more and more biopsies were done for an \"abnormal\" test (e.g. a radiograph) with creeping criteria for positivity, then one might expect that most of those patients would not have abnormal pathologic findings. Many of these problems came down to a lack of knowledge of the statistical properties of reality. Dr. Welch covers several of these problems directly and some of them by implication. His book is a breath of fresh air."}, {"userName": "Sam", "userReviewDate": "Jul 22, 2011", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/5855346-sam", "userReview": "Dr. Welch was involved in an experiment in which a group of men who had had heart attacks were split into two groups, one of which was equipped with devices to measure irregularities & the other which was given the usual regular checkups. The experiment was discontinued when the researchers found that the device-equipped group received more treatment & died in greater numbers. This got the author looking for similar medical treatment phenomena. If a form of cancer has become much more common over the years, the survival rate has improved, those receiving early detection live much longer than those who don't, & the over-all death rate from that form of cancer has stayed about the same over the years, there are two possible interpretations. One is that something is causing an increase in that form of cancer, while treatment of the cancer is improving. The other is that increased testing has led to treatment of people who would have never died from the form of cancer if it were left undiscovered & untreated. Dr. Welch argues that the latter is more likely.Not a cheerful book, with a lot talk about disease & death, but thought-provoking & important."}, {"userName": "Carl", "userReviewDate": "Apr 14, 2014", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/9169589-carl", "userReview": "Everyone should read this book, but I fear that few will. Partly because it is perceived as a difficult topic. No worries there: Dr. Welch and his co-authors make this as easy and straightforward a read as possible. Even if you barely passed high school biology or math, you'll have no problems here: the science is simple, the statistics are very clearly explained.Another reason folks might not read this is that they are comfortable delegating their personal health decisions to physicians. The facts indicate that this is not a good plan. The whole point of Dr. Welch's research is that physicians often do things that provide no statistically significant improvement to lifespan but do have a statistically significant likelihood of negative side effects. If your auto mechanic suggests an expensive diagnostic for your engine when you bring your well-running car in for a routine oil change, and then suggests a follow on test because the first was inconclusive, and these are expensive tests, and there's a chance that your engine will be ruined by the testing, you might want to have a better sense of what's going on. If all this happens while your car is running perfectly well, with no symptoms of trouble, then you're in a situation quite analogous to the superfluous diagnostic medical scanning that Dr. Welch writes about.Dr. Welch is careful to not pick on his colleagues. Although he does note that a physician's primary sources of information tend to be funded by drug companies or medical equipment manufactures. In addition, there are many economic reasons to ignore science and statistics, sub-conscious or not. A big factor is that a doctor, like anyone else, is often most comfortable with the \"old wives tales\" that they know. This sort of thing has gone on for centuries. One example, not from the book, is that of Dr. Ignaz Semmelweis. Semmelweis noticed that mothers would give birth in a hospital's obstetrical clinic only to die of puerperal fever soon after -- with a mortality rate of 10% to 35%. That's a scary amount of preventable death for a hospital. He determined that if doctors would wash their hands with a chlorinated lime solution (similar to today's anti-bacterial soaps), they could take the mortality rate down to below 1%. You don't need to be a doctor nor a statistician to see that this is a good deal. So what happened?In spite of published facts, Semmelweis' observations conflicted with the established, normative medical practice of the time. So his ideas were soundly rejected. It took about 20 years before Dr. Joseph Lister succeeded in getting doctors to accept the science, and only then because he built on the concepts that Louis Pasteur introduced. Most folks have heard of Listerine mouthwash, named after Lister. Nothing is named after Semmelweiss. But lots of women died in those intervening years.I use this example because it is so very obvious to us today that one should wash one's hands -- and yet, it took decades to get doctors to do it. It is difficult to realize sometimes that throughout history scientists have been labeled heretics because their data did not conform to then-current practice. In the 21st century we tend to feel as though every problem has been solved, and that we've got it all right. But maybe not so much, and Dr. Welch's book points out clear examples of facts not convincing physicians. This problem of normal practice not aligning with the facts, but going on anyways, is old news. It happened to Galileo, who had the audacity to propose that the earth rotates around the sun. It happened to Semmelweiss, and many others. And as Dr. Welch's book makes quite clear, it happens yet today. Okay, so back to the book for some modern day examples. Back in 1996, the US Preventative Services Task Force (USPSTF) recommended against routine obstetrical ultrasound. Why? Because they found that there is just no substantive benefit. The highly respected Cochrane Collaboration (which eschews any financial support from drug firms or equipment companies) agrees. But every single expectant mother that I have met since 1996 gets an ultrasound; I bet that's true for you too. The USPSTF has given up on the topic, because they recognize that this unhelpful and potentially negative scanning procedure is such a common practice that no one would listen to them anyway. [pp112-113] Yikes. But there's more. Also in 1996, the USPSTF recommended against routine fetal monitoring (the belt put around an expectant mother to monitor the about-to-be-born baby's heart beat). Once again, the Cochrane Collaboration agreed, noting that monitoring increased C-section rates by 66%, and that the risk of that to baby and mother is enormously worse than the potential benefit. What is that benefit?About one in a thousand babies would avoid a (non-fatal) seizure compared to two in a thousand without the monitoring. A one in a thousand change. But even then, no improvement in baby's health as measured by Apgar score, respiration, pulse, conditions like cerebral palsy, need for ICU - nothing. Yet, again, it is such a common practice that the agency feels it would be tilting at windmills to try to change it (even though doing so would clearly, from the numbers, save lives and reduce negative side effects). [pp105-106] Did I say, Yikes?There's lots more in the book, from mammograms to PSA tests to blood pressure and diabetes.By now you should be considering that there is real value in reading this book, if only to make us better informed consumers of the medical industry.Dr. Welch has done an extraordinary job of stating the facts, acknowledging the ambiguities, and making it clearer for individuals to understand the tradeoffs of their diagnostic scanning choices. Even if you continue to use screening that the facts might indicate you oughtn't, you'll have a better understanding of what the issues are."}, {"userName": "Asha Tenbroeke", "userReviewDate": "Mar 03, 2011", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/4696552-asha-tenbroeke", "userReview": "'Overdiagnosed' is, without a doubt, an important book. It convincingly shows that if we look harder for a disease, we find more \"abnormalities\" but we're not preventing any deaths. Instead, the more people are subjected to unneccesary medical procedures, which can be just scary, expersive and annoying but also debilitating or even lethal. The authors explains how this happens with great clarity. Let's say, as an example, that each year a hundred women find a lump in their breast. They go and see a doctor, who does an autopsy and confirmes it's breastcancer. All these women are treated. 90 get better, 10 die. Now, let's travel one year back in time. All 100.000 women in a town our having mammography to screen for early signs of breastcancer. Even though our hundred women wouldn't have lumps in their breasts yet, the mammography will show an abnormality. But they will not be the only ones with an abnormality. Research shows that up to 40 percent of all women have some sort of 'could be cancer could be nothing' in their breasts. This means that screening will not only raise a red flag for our 100 women who would have developed clinical symptoms of breastcancer (eg a lump) but also for up to 39.900 other women in their town. They will be scared, have biopsies, maybe have their breasts removed, just like our 100, but they were never destined to develop clinical symptoms. That would all be fine, if early detection of asymptomatic breastcancer would save a lot of lives. But as Gilbert Welch shows, it doesn't. Mortality rates have not gone down since wide spread breastcancer screening was introduced. So those 39.900 women were not lucky, they were overdiagnosed, because their abnormality would never have progressed into lethal cancer.Breastcancer, ofcourse, is just an example. Almost every disease or condition (high blood pressure, diabetes, high cholesterol, prostate cancer as notable examples) that we screen for in a large group of healthy individuals is prone to overdiagnosis. This is because, as Welch argues, the most serieus cases - which are also the ones to benefit most from treatment, because they are sicker and thus have more to loose and more to gain - don't need the screening: they will present with symptoms and see their doctor anyway. So screening mostly diagnoses relatively mild cases, people who otherwise feel ok. This 'mildly abnormal' group is, as in the breastcancer example above, much much larger than the 'dangerously ill' group. So what screening does is tranforming a large group of otherwise healthy people into patients by giving them an early diagnosis of a disease that may never progress to giving clinical symptoms. In other words: it makes patients out of healthy people who, even in the future, may have never gotten ill. And, to add insult to (nonexistent) injury, these now 'not symptomatic but worried' patients only really benefit from medical treatment until they do become symptomatic. But since they are also worried, and doctors are uncomfortabke doing nothing, they probably will get treatment, and suffer all the risks and side effects from it.Welch's remedy is simple: if research shows early detection has no benefits because it does not prevent suffering or death (as is the case for all examples I mentioned) don't go out and screen lots and lots of healthy people. Instead tell patients to visit their doctors as soon as a symptom occurs, find out what's wrong and treat accordingly. It will save just as many lives, but it will spare healthy but slightly 'abnormal' people ghe expense, anxiety and pain of being overdiagnosed."}, {"userName": "Jennifer", "userReviewDate": "Jan 20, 2012", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/1830075-jennifer", "userReview": "The biggest fault of this book is probably the tendency of the author to repeat himself rather a lot, both in explaining what he means and what he does not mean to say.

This book is not at all like that, although there is lots of medical information and stats to back it up, it's easy to consume without being a doctor.The overall position of the book is that technological advances in screening as well as shifting opinions in how preventative medicine is viewed have lead to an epidemic of over diagnosis. That over diagnosis in turn leads to numerous highly negative impacts for otherwise healthy people.Before considering the tidbits below, remember that a \"diagnosis\" can and very often will cause serious problems with health care insurance. The moment a healthy person becomes a \"patient\", many things change, and not for the better.Some highlights from the book:A change in thresholds for diagnosis of diabetes makes an additional 1.4 million people patients who were previously not.The threshold for cholesterol keeps changing, adding more than 13 million new patients.Studies that look back post diagnosis find that only a tiny number of patients are actually helped from this pattern of preventative medicine. Prostrate cancer is the worst offender, for every 1 person helped, 30 are over diagnosed and harmed to one degree or another.Imaging technologies have contributed to the problem over diagnosis. We can see more, so we find more, and thus encourage more treatment for what are really minor abnormalities. The people at least risk of a negative event are at highest risk of over diagnosis. The ability to see abnormalities on imaging far exceeds the medical community's ability to properly recommend a a measured course of action.Many of the doctors lowering thresholds are financially linked to the drug companies servicing those ailments as well as the companies who offer screening services.Most importantly, I learned to have more informed discussions with my doctor about thresholds, when the threshold was changed, and to deeply question any diagnosis involving the term \"pre\". Pre-cancer, pre-diabetes and others are the new triggers for potentially unnecessary and harmful intervention.This is a really good book and opened my eyes to the changing behaviour of the medical community and the impact it could have on myself and/or my family."}, {"userName": "YHC", "userReviewDate": "Nov 05, 2017", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/13459886-yhc", "userReview": "I totally agree with the author that the medical system seems to overdiagnose the patients. The benefits and the bad effects from over-diagnosed process could be put side by side to compare.With more and more sophisticated devices that we invented, we tend to be able to discover many diseases much earlier than they could actually affect our health.Welch gave us several real cases to let us see the terrible chain effect after overdiagnosed patients took following treatments, the allergic or inflammation of some drugs caused other part of organs to get infected then got another diagnosis of cancer in early stage (which could be wrong) ...In the end the surgery to remove the stuff that was actually not even expected at the first place.Welch showed some autopsy reports of cancer patients to find out the real causes of death, actually many cancer didn't develop as fast as we think to damage our health, but the treatment of cancer caused side effects and weaken the patients, other different complications caused the death.US is famous for its drug nation, and over-diagnosis is surely part of the package. It's a whole chain of business on medical treatment and drugs. Besides, if the doctors took measures of more passive, observing attitude, some got sued because patients got delayed treatments, so why not to start whatever chemo or chop off the tumors to avoid the lawsuit ? Even though more than 95% of diagnosis are not necessary, people ignore the metal stress the patients undergo, the burden of the whole medical system should carry, let alone the insurance company would not cover so the patients end up suck up the whole treatment procedures.Welch believes that we should be careful on giving following up checking up, some diseases are just the false alarm, some could be cured by immune system. Of course, if the patients are already at the last stage of cancer, then whatever treatment might not have positive effects. The drugs to prevent Osteoporosis could actually just a sham.An very informative book for those who believe all the yearly health check is necessary."}, {"userName": "snow-princess", "userReviewDate": "Mar 26, 2018", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/10933660-snow-princess", "userReview": "I have conflicting feelings about this book. Yes, over diagnosis is a problem, but under diagnosis resulting in death/ severe problem also happens. Could a cancer or disease that wasn\u2019t caught early and killed someone have been stopped or prevented by early detection? We don\u2019t know that answer anymore then we know the answer to what the outcome would have been for patients who had a diagnosis because of early detection and received treatment, if they had opted out of treatment. I do think the author brings up some excellent points about how the screening guidelines don\u2019t reflect science, which is problematic and would go a long way towards helping the situation of unnecessary intervention."}, {"userName": "Adrian", "userReviewDate": "Apr 27, 2018", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/999192-adrian", "userReview": "Important topic here, well presented.

The proliferation of fetal monitoring in the 1970s was associated with a 66 percent increase in the number of women told they needed emergency C-sections, but it did not affect how often babies needed intensive care\u2014or the frequency of infant death. The introduction of prostate cancer screening resulted in over a million additional American men being told they have prostate cancer, and while studies disagree on the question of whether a few have been helped\u2014there\u2019s no disagreement that most have been treated for a disease that was never going to bother them. As a society consumed by technological advances and scientific breakthroughs, we have narrowed the definition of normal and increasingly are turning more and more people into patients. Diagnoses of a great many conditions, including high blood pressure, osteoporosis, diabetes, and even cancer, have skyrocketed over the last few decades, while the number of deaths from those diseases has been largely unaffected. \u00a0 Drawing on twenty-five years of medical practice and research, Dr. H. Gilbert Welch and his colleagues, Dr. Lisa M. Schwartz and Dr. Steven Woloshin, have studied the effects of screenings and presumed preventative measures for disease and \u201cpre-disease.\u201d Welch argues that while many Americans believe that more diagnosis is always better, the medical, social, and economic ramifications of unnecessary diagnoses are in fact seriously detrimental. Unnecessary surgeries, medication side effects, debilitating anxiety, and the overwhelming price tag on health care are only a few of the potential harms of overdiagnosis.  \u00a0 Through the stories of his patients and colleagues, and drawing from popular media, Dr. Welch illustrates how overdiagnosis occurs and the pitfalls of routine tests in healthy individuals. We are introduced to patients such as Michael, who had a slight pain in his back. Despite soon feeling fine, a questionable abnormal chest X-ray led to a sophisticated scan that detected a tiny clot in his lung. Because it could not be explained, his doctors suggested that it could be a sign of cancer. Michael did not have cancer, but he now sees a psychiatrist to deal with his anxiety about cancer.  \u00a0 According to Dr. Welch, a complex web of factors has created the phenomenon of overdiagnosis: the popular media promotes fear of disease and perpetuates the myth that early, aggressive treatment is always best; in an attempt to avoid lawsuits, doctors have begun to leave no test undone, no abnormality\u2014no matter how incidental\u2014overlooked; and, inevitably, profits are being made from screenings, a wide array of medical procedures, and, of course, pharmaceuticals. Examining the social, medical, and economic ramifications of a health care system that unnecessarily diagnoses and treats patients, Welch makes a reasoned call for change that would save us from countless unneeded surgeries, debilitating anxiety, and exorbitant costs.", "title": "Overdiagnosed: Making People Sick in the Pursuit of Health", "url": "http://www.goodreads.com/book/show/8343437-overdiagnosed", "average": 4.15, "cover": "https://images.gr-assets.com/books/1320478703l/8343437.jpg", "reviews": 151, "authors": [{"url": "https://www.goodreads.com/author/show/127454.H_Gilbert_Welch", "name": "H.
