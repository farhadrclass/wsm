I really enjoyed it.In early eighteen hundreds, Michael Lawler, Marquess of Bourne, freshly in control of his family's estate at the ripe age of twenty one, is playing cards with his late father's friend, Viscount of Langford. Viscount of Langford is a trusted ally, father to Michael's best friend. Until recently Langford oversaw Michael's fortune and had just turned it over to him.Michael trusts Langford and when the viscount deliberately goads him, Michael doesn't see the danger until he makes a wrong bet and loses everything. As the reality sinks in, Michael has that moment we all have had before - the instant when the childhood screeches to a halt and you realize that safety net is gone, adults are bastards, and your decisions have real consequences.Losing the estate hurts, humiliation hurts, but betrayal sends Michael over the edge. He is forced to reinvent himself to survive. He cuts all ties with society, severs relationship with his childhood friends - after all his best friend's father is the one who took advantage of him - and he even gives up his name. From now on he is Bourne.Fast-forward ten years. Bourne is one of the four partners in the most lucrative gaming hell of London. He rebuilt his fortune, but regaining his estate and getting his revenge so far eluded him. He learns that Langford has gambled away his estate. It's within Bourne reach. All he has to do to get it is to marry lady Penelope Marbury. The same Penelope who used to be his other best friend.Lady Penelope Marbury is a tarnished flower in the eyes of society. A few years ago she had been betrothed to a duke, who abruptly ended their engagement in a dramatic fashion and instead married the woman he actually loved. This led to all sorts of speculation about what was wrong with Penelope and why couldn't she hold on to the Duke and nearly gave Penelope's mother an aneurism. Two of Penelope's four sisters hurriedly jumped on the first proposals they could get just to avoid being crippled by Penelope's misfortune. Penelope herself had received a few proposals over the years and she turned them down. Now she is firmly on the shelf. Her father, who recently came into possession of Bourne's estate, adds it to her dowry in a desperate hope to get her married off.Penelope is smart. She is smart and independent, but above all she is patient and very sincere. She had caught a glimpse of what love was when her fiance abandoned her and she wants to experience it. She wants it so much, that she waits despite society's scorn and her mother's pressure. She wants it for her two remaining sisters as well.Fate crashes Penelope and Michael into each other and he forces her into marriage.This is a interesting book. First, the writing.He stood in the darkness, silhouetted by the painted window overlooking the main room of London\u2019s most exclusive gaming hell. From the club floor, the window appeared as nothing but a stunning work of art\u2014a massive piece of stained glass depicting the fall of Lucifer. In brilliant hues, the enormous angel\u2014four times the size of the average man\u2014tumbled toward the pit floor, cast into London\u2019s dark corners by Heaven\u2019s Army.Isn't it elegant? I enjoyed reading it just for the language alone. But there is more.Michael is an ass. He built an icy cage around himself and he wears it like armor. Anything that made him weak - like for example, having compassion or trusting people - is gone. He is hard, ruthless, and vicious. And now he is married to Penelope. Remember how I mentioned that Penelope is sincere? When Michael is being an ass, it hurts her feelings and she tells him and shows him that her feelings are hurt. That in turns makes Michael feel like an ass, and he doesn't like it.I found the whole process hilarious, although it isn't deliberately written as humorous. I'm a mother to two teenagers. Teenagers, like toddlers, occasionally suffer from complete lack of empathy. So there are times when I have to be very open and say things like, \"You really hurt my feelings. I'm mad at you and I don't want to talk to you right now.\" That's what Penelope ends up doing and watching Michael who sees himself as Bourne, uncompromising and merciless, struggle with it is amusing.She thaws him out, piece by piece, and he resists it so hard, that even his friends and co-owners in the gaming hell rub his nose in the fact that he is screwed up. Michael does have a change of heart in the middle of the book.I saw several reviews that mentioned that Michael's coldness was off-putting. Well, yes. It's meant to be off-putting. This is a redemption story, and he starts in a dark place. But he isn't a chic with a dick that we sometimes see in the historical fiction. He doesn't brood in his own head about how his father was unloving and the boys at Eton were mean to him and oh, if only there was a woman, with whom he could share his feelings for ten pages while crying, telling her how beautiful she is, and simultaneously praising her lady parts that taste like peaches. Bleh. I found Michael to be refreshing. He is a guy, he is an ass, and he has to work at being human.Penelope was awesome. She had backbone and adventurous spirit, and she didn't put up with any of Michael's crap. It goes somewhat like this.Michael: I am angry you did this. I'm furious.Penelope: Whatever.Michael: .... But, but, but...Penelope: Remember how you hurt my feelings by doing this mean thing? There you go.Michael: Well, well then, I will go to the gaming hell and be badass there.Michael's friends at the gaming hell: What are you doing here? Don't you have a beautiful wife?If you take into account that Michael is actually kind of scary and Penelope is really endearing, you can see how I found this book deeply funny.In the end, Michael never turns into a girl, but he does love Penelope, completely and absolutely, and she deserves every bit of it. Like all books, this one has a few flaws, but I liked it. As always, your mileage may vary.Sarah McLean's website: http://macleanspace.com/romance/a-rog..."}, {"userName": "Baba  ", "userReviewDate": "Apr 05, 2012", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/4669232-baba", "userReview": "FULL REVIEW NOW POSTED5+++ VERY SHINY STARS!\"I want to lay you down in the light of The Angel and make love to you.\"\nWow, wow, wow! What a fabulous read! *hugging my Kindle* Prepare yourself to be gushed upon.From revenge to love. Michael intends to corrupt Penelope. He wants to turn her from light to dark, from good to bad. His goal is to totally ruin her. And it will feel so splendid. A Rogue by Any Other Name is such a great example why I love to read HR. *does the happy dance*Despite my minor issues--a jerk-ish hero and his opinion of being not worthy enough for our lovable heroine and the ending that felt a bit corny and a heroine who was a bit too weepy for my liking--I totally devoured this book. Yeah, seconds and minutes passed. Hours\u2026but it didn't matter. All that mattered was this book and these characters. I want more!\"Do you? Do you see how much I value you? Do you feel it? (\u2026) \"I adore you,\" he whispered. \"I wish I could be the man you deserve.\" She lifted her own hand to capture his at her cheek. \"Michael\u2026you can be that man.\"Darn, Michael, you deserve Penelope! Just open your mind and your heart and look thoroughly.London 1831Michael wants Falconwell back. The land he had lost ten years ago while gambling and vowed to regain. At any cost--even if he had to marry an aging spinster. Their \"first\" encounter was very entertaining.\"Sirrah! Do not come any closer! I\u2026\" she flailed for a decent threat. \"I am armed!\"His response was unmoved. \"Do you plan to smother me with your muff?\"\"You, sir, are not a gentleman.\"\"Ah. Truth at last.\"She took another step back. \"I am going home.\"\"I don't think so, Penelope.\"Penelope was a means to an end--the path to Michael's revenge. Every time he touched her or showed her the slightest interest, it was for his benefit and his goals. Naturally, Penelope didn't want to be a part of his revenge though. Well, Michael is rather surprised to discover that this woman, this marriage means so much more to him. It scared him.Yes, I love it! Yes, I totally dig the characters, the witty, richly-textured and wonderful dialogue and most of all\u2026the love scenes\u2026they left me gloriously breathless. My oh my, this woman knows how to write utterly sensual and erotic love scenes. A Rogue by Any Other Name displays romance at its best. I adored the kissing and touching. It was so well-written. Kudos, Ms. MacLean! Boy, I was consumed with excitement, with breathlessness while reading A Rogue by Any Other Name. Even though there are not a lot of love scenes, they were so well-placed. That said, they were there because the path of anticipation has been exhausted and I was on the brink of being combusted. He wanted her that moment. Immediately. Without hesitation. So he lifted her in his arms and carried her up the stairs. Up to decadence. Up to pleasure.Oh, yes, Michael's adventuresome beauty will discover how utterly sensual and erotic love-making can be. And even though Penelope is not a beauty in the common sense, we all know that beauty lies in the eye of the beholder. Michael believes that Penelope is a beauty and love makes you feel beautiful and cherished, after all.The characters are splendid. Michael and Penelope are complex and very interesting. Penelope knows how to speak tartly and I relished her smart mouth. Michael. The jerk. Most of the time a jerk makes a good hero, and the dark and brooding Michael was a great hero. Furthermore, it didn't hurt at all that he was so handsome and he was perfect with his hands and mouth. I can't deny that his sexual prowess was fabulous and I loved his deadpan humor. Overall it was such a pleasure to witness their evolving relationship.Guess what? The author portrayed many intriguing secondary characters in this book and I'm utterly convinced that Cross and Lady Philippa's story will be another winner when I was reading this:\"Well, since you came all the way here\u2026how may I be of service, Lady Philippa?\" She took a deep breath. Released it. \"I require ruination. And I hear you are an expert in the subject.\"I can't wait to read their story. Patience, Baba\u2026A Rogue by Any Other Name is a wonderfully penned and witty HR. I am so glad that I discovered another great HR author. I'm off reading Nine Rules to Break When Romancing a Rake.HIGHLY RECOMMENDED!"}, {"userName": "UniquelyMoi ~ BlithelyBookish", "userReviewDate": "Jun 26, 2011", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/1113032-uniquelymoi-blithelybookish", "userReview": "A Rogue by Any Other Name is the first book in Sarah MacLean\u2019s The Rules of Scoundrels series and from the first page to the last is filled with emotion \u2013 happiness, heartbreak, passion, romance \u2013 a truly fabulous story!I often find, with historical romances, that the rules society has placed on the women can make them seem mousey and pathetic, so I love it when an author takes those women and makes them strong enough to laugh at their peers \u2013 or at least not care enough to conform to what\u2019s expected of them. That always makes for some funny, sexy stories, and that\u2019s what Ms. MacLean has done with A Rogue by Any Other Name. What a scoundrel wants, a scoundrel gets...A decade ago, the Marquess of Bourne was cast from society with nothing but his title. Now a partner in London\u2019s most exclusive gaming hell, the cold, ruthless Bourne will do whatever it takes to regain his inheritance\u2014including marrying perfect, proper Lady Penelope Marbury.A broken engagement and years of disappointing courtships have left Penelope with little interest in a quiet, comfortable marriage, and a longing for something more. How lucky that her new husband has access to such unexplored pleasures.Bourne may be a prince of London\u2019s underworld, but he vows to keep Penelope untouched by its wickedness\u2014a challenge indeed as the lady discovers her own desires, and her willingness to wager anything for them... even her heart.I thoroughly enjoyed the Love By Numbers series \u2013 in fact, I\u2019ve often said that if I could choose to be any heroine from a historical romance novel, it would be Lady Calpurnia Hartwell from Nine Rules to Break When Romancing A Rake. She\u2019s strong, independent, feisty, funny\u2026 I\u2019d be her in a heartbeat, but to be honest, I feel that way about most of Sarah MacLean\u2019s heroines. Rarely do I get as attached to the heroine of a story as I do to the hero, but with this author\u2019s books, I always do. But I digress\u2026.Our hero, Michael, Marquess of Bourne, is horrible! He\u2019s not just an ass, he\u2019s a pain in the ass! And I adored every single bit of him! You just know that in the end, he\u2019s going to get his, and watching it come about is just so much fun! We go from him devising his plan for revenge, then watching him carry it out, knowing that he never considers - not even for a moment - that it won\u2019t go as flawlessly as he expected. Then we see, bit by bit, the transformation; the shock when he starts to question his motives, his feelings, his true wants and desires. I absolutely love watching this transformation!Our heroine, Lady Penelope Marbury, truly is my kind of woman. As I said above, Sarah MacLean is one of the few authors who can write heroines who are as perfect as her heroes. Penelope is, in some ways, a victim of her times, but she doesn\u2019t let those suffocating rules of society keep her from having an \u201cadventure\u201d. I LOVE this about her! She reminds me somewhat of Lady Calpurnia, and perhaps that\u2019s why I adore her so much. She didn\u2019t sit about whimpering or simpering as she did her needlework, waiting for something exciting to happen. Nope! She found ways to create her own excitement. I love how she took life by the horns and didn\u2019t let go!And the story! Oh, my goodness! Take a rake \u2013 or in this case, a rogue \u2013 and give him a truly compelling, believable need for revenge, then toss in an innocent, but not na\u00efve, heroine, and you have the makings of an incredible story, and that\u2019s what this one is. Twists, turns, heartache and happiness \u2013 never a dull moment and I adored every word! The bottom line: It probably goes without saying, but I can\u2019t say it enough \u2013 I love this story! It was filled with emotion and had me laughing, sighing and fanning myself, start to finish. Sarah MacLean is one of the few \u201cauto-buy\u201d authors on my list, and books like A Rogue by Any Other Name is why.I am soooo looking forward to the next book in the series, One Good Earl Deserves a Lover and cannot wait to watch Penelope\u2019s sister, Lady Philippa Marbury, match wits with the man known only as Cross, the bookkeeper of the The Fallen Angel gaming hell. That is a story guaranteed to deliver everything I crave in historical romance, and a story not to be missed!"}, {"userName": "Mo", "userReviewDate": "Nov 11, 2013", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/11856352-mo", "userReview": "\"I\u2019m going to corrupt you\"\nAgain, I ask myself why do I only dip into Historicals a few times a year?

It's a good choice for those who enjoy a 'jerky hero', to borrow a phrase from GR pal Alyssa;-) Bourne is dark, and working hard to be somewhat awesomely, unrepentantly villainous. He's my kind of hero, that's for sure:) Think Anne Stuart-lite (*very* lite, but, still...). Little does Bourne know that it will be impossible to keep his distance, physically and emotionally, from his lady wife. Ahhh, they ALL believe they can succeed at that, don't they? It's a be-a-u-tiful thing to watch them fail:)Lady Penelope is 29, and 'on the shelf', as they say. However, she has never stopped thinking of and, maybe somewhat secretly, pining for her childhood friend, now the Marquess of Bourne. This one's a girl after my own heart! By God, she's tired of being proper and doing what her family demands of her. And, once she marries Bourne, all bets are off! She's going to have adventures and a life of her own regardless of what her husband thinks. Yet, still, with an innate kindness and strong sense of responsibility, she does this in her own quiet, charming way. Bourne and Penelope are electric together! One can't help but enjoy them immensely!! This story has everything one could want: emotion, a reluctant hero, a kind but adventurous heroine, and some yummy, steamy scenes! I am SO looking forward to the next book!! The men of The Fallen Angel are sexy and fascinating!- My Favorite Quote -\"I'm going to corrupt you,\" he promised her skin, one hand sliding down the swell of her stomach, feeling the way the muscles there tensed and quivered at his touch. \"I'm going to turn you from light to dark, from good to bad.

They always fall the hardest.\u201d I wasn\u2019t wrong.Bourne is playing a game of cards with Viscount Langford, his best friend\u2019s father, and his guardian, when he loses. Not just loses, but loses big. Bourne loses everything. Langford purposely goaded Bourne and pushed him into wagering his holdings. Langford\u2019s reasoning was that he\u2019d been the one tending the lands and properties, he didn\u2019t want to give it up to the young Marquess after all his hard work. Langford got greedy. So he pushed Bourne. And Bourne lost.With nothing more than a shilling and the clothes on his back, Bourne becomes a self-made businessman, and one of the owners of the gaming hell Fallen Angel. Bourne is now worth easily triple what he lost, but he wants his property, his history, his legacy back. He\u2019s spent a decade trying to buy, cheat or steal it all back. Then it is finally within his grasp.Penelope, fondly referred to in Eleven Scandals as \u201cthe Grape,\u201d was ruined after Leighton let her break their engagement. Not in that way, oh no. Her reputation may be pristine, but no one wants the girl who couldn\u2019t keep Leighton, the Duke of Disdain. It forced two of her sisters\u2019 marriages and has cast a shameful pall over her other sisters. In an ironic twist of fate, her father gains Bourne\u2019s old lands, and adds it to her dowry. Bourne goes after his lands, and if Penelope, is in his way, so be it.the letters at the beginning of each chapter are surprisingly well done and achingly bittersweet. Penelope and Bourne were childhood friends, borderline sweethearts, and I think that is the main reason this romance worked so well for me. Each letter is a glimpse into their relationship, and into how much he\u2019s changed, until he no longer responds to her, then finally she no longer sends them. Bourne purposely compromises Penelope, flaunts it in front of her father to force the marriage, because all he wants is his property. But one thing Penelope makes him realize is that he has never looked beyond getting his land and ruining Langford. What happens once he\u2019s reached that goal? Will he be happy?My favorite part of this book is when Bourne decides to court his wife. It\u2019s a scene where Penelope is going ice skating with her sisters, and Bourne\u2026changes. I felt that was his critical moment, the moment where if he didn\u2019t do something he would lose her, and that was unacceptable, no matter what he\u2019d said before.I love Sarah MacLean\u2019s voice and the characters she\u2019s created. I rather liked the jerk of a hero, even though he was ridiculously rude to the heroine. But Bourne is supposed to be an ass. It makes it that much sweeter when he falls. When he falls for his wife, he doesn\u2019t know how to keep her, he knows only that he\u2019ll never let her go.eARC courtesy of Avon via edelwiess"}, {"userName": "KatLynne", "userReviewDate": "Jul 14, 2011", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/2435483-katlynne", "userReview": "Sarah MacLean has become one of my favorite HR authors.

While there are a few places that could be referred to as \u201ccheesy,\u201d it still worked for me and I loved it!The young Michael, Marquess of Bourne, has lost EVERYTHING with the turn of a card! He\u2019d been fleeced! He walks away with little more than his disgraced title. At the age of twenty one, Bourne\u2019s entire life becomes full of hatred and he vows revenge and restitution. For the next nine years, that is what fuels his every decision. He is now one of four partners in London\u2019s most exclusive Gaming Hells and is richer by far than most. Still, it is not enough. The only thing he wants more than his former home, Falconwell, is to destroy the one who took it from him. Penelope Marbury was first introduced in the third installment of SM\u2019s Love By Numbers Trilogy. The scandal that led up to her father breaking her engagement to the Duke of Leighton has ruined her chances of a good match. Even though she is innocent of any wrongdoing, broken engagements were always blamed on the woman. Once considered the most darling of darlings of the ton, now, years later, she finds herself a spinster with a family desperate to see her wed. But Penelope wants MORE! This compassionate and smart young woman yearns to be wanted and loved. But it seems an impossible goal. Her father insists she must marry. Recently winning Falconwell in a card game, he places this property as part of her dowry, hoping this will attract more suitors.And so begins the journey of Penny and Michael. They were childhood friends until the loss of his estates. She hasn\u2019t seen or heard from him since his defeat. Obtaining Falconwell is the only thing that gives him purpose and he doesn\u2019t care who gets hurt in the process. He ruthlessly pursues Penny ensuring their marriage. Penny quickly learns the boy she once knew is gone and doesn\u2019t recognize this hard and bitter man. And once again her choices are taken from her \u2026by a man.Penny\u2019s life as well as most women of the day has been ruled by the demands and whims of men; first her father, then as Leighton\u2019s fianc\u00e9, and now Michael. Now, she is trapped by a man once again.  I liked this woman. She transforms into a beautiful, smart young lady who stands up for herself. She desires adventure and is no longer satisfied to settle for pastels! Michael, \u201cwicked as sin and twice as handsome\u201d has her heart yearning for so much more! And he soon finds himself no longer able to resist his desire for Penny.  \u201cI am going to explore you\u2026to discover your heat and softness, every bit of your decadence.\u201d \u2026.\u201dYou make my mouth water.\u201d  He loved the taste of her, a \u201cdrug of which he could never have enough.\u201dI loved this book - The sensual pull, the banter between these two, the laugh out loud moments, and the heartbreak of unrequited love and a heart that cannot get past feelings of unworthiness. And still, so, so much more than I\u2019ve stated! Sarah MacLean had me so invested I didn\u2019t want to stop until the end! And with the teaser added for the next installment, I can hardly wait!"}, {"userName": "Khanh, first of her name, mother of bunnies", "userReviewDate": "Feb 07, 2013", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/4527753-khanh-first-of-her-name-mother-of-bunnies", "userReview": "After having read so many insipid, good, but uncomplicated Regency romances lately, this book was a breath of fresh air for me.The Marquess of Bourne had a dissolute youth, and lost his family estate to of at through a game of cards, and decides to make it his mission in life to get his estate back as well as get revenge on the man who won it from him (Viscount Langford and his innocent son, Tommy). Frankly, I think that Langford did him a favor, since that was the kick in the ass that got him off his ass and doing something with his life. 10 years later, Bourne finds out that Langford lost the estate to his childhood friend, Lady Penelope's father, and the estate is tied to her dowry. Penelope has survived a scandal of being jilted by her fianc\u00e9e, a duke, years ago, and her reputation has suffered since. Her father is determined to marry her off, and the addition of the Falconwell estate is designed to attract a bevy of suitors.Bourne, determined as hell to get his estate back, all but kidnaps and compromises Penelope, and all but forces her to marry him. The marriage is off to a bad start, filled with negotiations and threats, more of a business deal than anything resembling love. Penelope misses her childhood friend, who is now an unrecognizable shadow of himself, hell-bent on revenge and nothing else. They pretend to be in love in the eyes of the Ton, but the early days of marriage is fraught with Bourne ignoring her and his own heart, and a fair bit of misunderstanding.Halfway through the book, to my delight, Bourne realizes he has been an asshole, and starts trying to make it up to her; Penelope is suspicious, a leopard doesn't change his stripes, after all. Their reconciliation is sweet, but Bourne's need for revenge consumes him and threatens to tear them apart.I really liked this book, I liked the other members of the Fallen Angels Club, and look forward to reading their stories. I especially disliked Olivia, Penelope's sister, who is a frilly, fluffy, empty-headed girl, and hope she will get her own book later on when she matures."}, {"userName": "Susan Elizabeth Phillips", "userReviewDate": "Mar 01, 2016", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/5890362-susan-elizabeth-phillips", "userReview": "The perfect place to start reading Sarah MacLean is with the first of her Rule of Scoundrels series.

He lost all he had inherited from his parents' untimely death to a man who sat there and laughed at him. Embarrassed and devastated, Bourne vanishes, not to be seen in polite society again. His only thought is for revenge, to bury Langford one day and reclaim his lands of Falconwell. For nine years Bourne worked his way up, becoming part-owner of The Fallen Angel, now London's most-well-known gaming hell. Along with three other men, Bourne is now wealthier than he has ever been \u2014 except he still doesn't have his land back. But now he knows how to get it.Penelope is 28 and on the verge of becoming a spinster. Eight years ago she was engaged to the Duke of Leighton. Fans of Sarah MacLean will know him as the hero from Eleven Scandals to Start to Win a Duke's Heart. But Leighton fell in love with someone else, and Penelope was dumped. It was quite the scandal, and her reputation has never recovered. But her father has recently won the Falconwell lands in a game of cards (from Langford) and has attached them to her dowry, knowing these vast lands will surely bring in some suitors. And it brings Bourne.Bourne and Penelope were actually great friends growing up. They played as kids then exchanged frequent letters after Bourne left for school. But once his parents died and Bourne lost everything, they lost contact for 16 years. Bourne wants Falconwell. Period. If that means having to marry Penelope to get it, he could care less. So he kidnaps Penelope one night (as she is walking in the snow) and keeps her overnight so her family thinks she will be ruined, forcing her to marry him.A Rogue by Any Other Name is the first book in Sarah MacLean's Rules of Scoundrels series, and I really enjoyed it. I love a book with a marriage of convenience, and this one has such a dark and broken hero. Bourne is so set on revenge that he cares for nothing else. He forces Penelope into marriage, and I should have hated him. He is cruel and arrogant, but the author gives you enough glimpses into his mind that you know there is a chance he can be redeemed.Although Penelope is somewhat duped into marriage, she isn't terrified or totally devastated that it happened. Don't get me wrong: She is tired of her entire life being steered by others. She feels a great guilt that she had a scandalous engagement all those years ago that ruined her sisters' chances for a good marriage. If she marries Bourne, though, he promises to help her sisters find a good match. In return, he gets proof from her father of something vile about Langford. So she marries him more for her sisters' sake. But, she also remembers the charming, warm boy and man he used to be. And I think deep down she expected to find that side of him much quicker than she actually did.Bourne is hard to take at some points. He is truly uncaring for her feelings at first. As when he says to her how desperate men are to get Falconwell:He was very close. Too close, leaning in, lowering his voice to a whisper, the breath of his words against the arch of her cheek heightening her nervousness. She did not breathe, too focused on the heat of him, on what he would say next. \"They'll even marry an aging spinster to get it.\"She hated him then. Hated the words, the way he spoke them with such simple cruelty. Tears threatened.No. No. She would not cry.Not for this beast of a man who was nothing like the boy she'd known. The one she'd dreamed would one day return.Not like this.I can see how some might be turned off, but for me, he is redeemed so well at the end that it was worth the struggle to get there. We see him eventually learn to woo his wife and work his way out of his focus on revenge. And I really believed the devastation we see in the prologue when he loses everything. The romance is very wicked, as Bourne slowly learns that he truly does care for Penelope and wants what she has to offer.I also adored what we see of the three other men who own the gaming hell with Bourne. Cross is the accountant of the bunch \u2014 a tall, ginger-haired man who definitely has his way with women, but is going to have a great heroine to deal with in the next book.This book is dark with a broken hero and a heroine with just enough spunk to stand up to the hero, no matter how dark it gets. I can't wait for the next one!Rating: B"}, {"userName": "Bark", "userReviewDate": "Aug 10, 2015", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/2905339-bark", "userReview": "I listened to this book as an unabridged audiobook read by Rosalyn Landor. She does a fine rather snooty job with the narration which fits the historical setting and a fabulous job with the heroine but when it comes time to do to the manly voices I cringed a little. I would\u2019ve much rather had a male voicing the guy parts but they didn\u2019t ask me.It\u2019s been a bit since I\u2019ve read a historical romance and this one had a lovely leisurely setup that introduced the relationship between childhood friends Michael and Penelope by letters they wrote when they were children and via flashbacks to their friendship. It gave me high hopes for the relationship to come.As a young man, Michael lost everything in a moment of overeager stupidity and has spent the past decade working to reclaim what was once his. He disappeared from Penelope\u2019s life and hasn\u2019t been there when she\u2019s needed a friend. Because her daddy wants her married off, and soon, he\u2019s attached some very attractive land to Penelope\u2019s dowry. Land that once belonged to Michael, land Michael will do almost anything to get back . . . Can you see where this is going?So yeah, Michael suddenly re-enters her life and pretty much steamrolls over it to get what he wants. He doesn\u2019t seem anything like the Michael from the letters and that made me a little sad for Penelope who was so genuinely happy to see her old friend when they meet up again. But then he opens his mouth and ugly spew slips out and she\u2019s not so thrilled. He\u2019s changed and he\u2019s a demanding ass who keeps secrets and strong-arms her into marrying him and then is all about The Revenge. He must get The Revenge! Even if it hurts those who love him.Ugh. Ugh. And ugh. I don\u2019t like this type of \u201chero\u201d. Never will, I\u2019m sad to say. He does eventually realize the error of his ways but it\u2019s all a little too little, a little too late. I am not a patient gal so I can only give this one a three. The writing was great; there was wit, sensuality and Penelope was not a push over and I will read this author in the future but I can\u2019t give this story any more than a 3 because of Michael. He is an ass, he knows he\u2019s an ass at least, but that does not change the fact that he behaves like an ass for a majority of the story. His penchant for ass-holi-ness causes no end of conflict and though his fingers may have been magical, his nonsense had me wanting to do this.\n\u201cI\u2019m going to turn you from light to dark, from good to bad. I\u2019m going to ruin you.\u201d She didn\u2019t care. She was his. He owned her in this moment, with this touch. \u201cAnd do you know how it will feel?\u201d She sighed the word this time. \u201cSplendid.\u201d"}, {"userName": "Jilly", "userReviewDate": "Sep 19, 2015", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/25894509-jilly", "userReview": "Back in ye old days, marriage was a business transaction - all about what would look good on paper.

She started me on my new found historical love affair with her superb Nine Rules to Break When Romancing a Rake and I have not looked back so I may be a bit biased in saying that I have loved everything she has since written, including A Rogue By Any Other Name. This book is a bit different though as our hero, Michael, Marquess of Bourne is quite unlikable for a good bit of the book. He forces a marriage of convenience with an old childhood friend, Lady Penelope Marbury and there are many ups and downs but I loved how their deep abiding love for each other finally trumps and Michael becomes a swoon worthy hero to the delightful Penelope.Bourne lost everything with the turn of a card during a card game and it has shaped him into the man he is today. He is so bent on revenge against the man that took it all from him, nothing else matters but destroying his former guardian and gaining back his family home and lands. It is now ten years later and Bourne is part of a successful gaming hell and he has rebuilt himself financially and when he hears that his land is part of his childhood friend Penelopes dowry, well, he knows what he must do to finally secure his past.Penelope is thrilled to see Bourne again one snowy night but it quickly becomes evident that this is not the boy from her childhood or the boy she used to correspond with frequently. No, this grown up Bourne is hard, unyielding and cold. She agrees to his 'proposal' as Penelope has already caused a huge scandal in the past (though not from her doing) and she needs to secure good matches for her two younger sisters. Together, they agree to their marriage terms and seal the deal, so to say. Oh, but Bourne seems to have no heart when he shoves Penelope away time and time again--despite there very heated attraction--and it makes Penelope, already at her wits end with the way her life is playing out, buck up and stand up to Bourne.I will admit, I wasn't sure if I could really grow to love Bourne. He is such a complete jerk for almost the entire book but there were enough glimpses of his own thoughts and the sweet childhood letters that I knew somewhere beneath that hard layer, a man worthy of swoon worthiness was there. I do wish his 'aha' moment happened a bit sooner because when he finally did see the light, Penelope was hard pressed to believe him. And who can really blame her? Bourne would give an inch and then remind her that is was all for show (to prove to society they were truly in love and gain her sisters respectable suitors), Penelope got to be so wound tight it was hard to believe in the gradual change in Bourne. I loved the addition of the letters back and forth, it really added to the story and helped set the tone for the quick marriage of convenience as we could see that our couple had a strong bond as children. This book is sure to have something to please any romance fan--a vengeful man so bent on destruction that he almost misses the thing that will finally make him complete again, a heroine who is smart, plucky, and has a quick comeback for all of Bournes rudeness all set within the glittering world of an elite gaming hell. An absolutely wonderful romance of childhood friends, an unconventional marriage of convenience, revenge and proof that true love heals even the most jaded of hearts. 4 1/2 starsOh, but Ms. MacLean?

Comparada con lo que se publica en castellano desde hace unos a\u00f1os, dir\u00eda incluso que muy buena. He disfrutado m\u00e1s de la relectura que de la primera lectura que hice cuando se public\u00f3, y supongo que es precisamente por esa falta de rom\u00e1ntica hist\u00f3rica de calidad editada en Espa\u00f1a \u00faltimamente. De hecho, confieso que, al acabar de leerla, me compr\u00e9 el resto de la serie sin dudarlo y la devor\u00e9 en pocos d\u00edas (ya comentar\u00e9 esas novelas m\u00e1s adelante). A esta primera entrega no deb\u00ed prestarle mucha atenci\u00f3n en su momento, ya que la anterior serie de la autora \u201cLove by Numbers\u201d no me convenci\u00f3. La novela sigue la l\u00ednea de la autora en cuanto a estilo literario (directo, muy dialogado, sin florituras), aunque mejora. Tambi\u00e9n mejora en lo que respecta a los personajes y al concepto. Me refiero a que las protagonistas femeninas de esta Sarah MacLean suelen ser tan rebeldes, tan distintas al resto de las mujeres de la \u00e9poca en la que transcurren sus historias, que m\u00e1s parecen del siglo XXI ligeramente adaptadas al XIX. En esta novela, ella, Penelope, tambi\u00e9n traspasa algunos de los l\u00edmites que su sociedad impone a las mujeres, pero resulta m\u00e1s cre\u00edble por la edad y las circunstancias en las que se halla. Sin embargo, creo que es \u00e9l, Michael, el que se lleva el protagonismo en esta historia. Enamora con facilidad y consigue que te enganches a la novela. La f\u00f3rmula no es original: propietario de un club de juego (uno de los propietarios, m\u00e1s concretamente) repudiado \u201caparentemente\u201d por la sociedad, pero con mucho poder sobre los nobles que frecuentan su club. Es una f\u00f3rmula que siempre da resultado, y aunque no alcanza la altura del list\u00f3n que han dejado Lorraine Heath (serie \u201cLos hu\u00e9rfanos de St. James\u201d) y Lisa Kleypas (Derek, de la serie \u201cLos jugadores\u201d) se acerca un poco a su nivel, por lo que considero que es un merecido Premio RITA, y consigue despertar nuestra curiosidad por leer el resto de la serie. La novela nos habla de venganza y de rencor, pero tambi\u00e9n de confianza. La relaci\u00f3n de pareja es bonita, entretenida y se cuece poco a poco desde un matrimonio de conveniencia, y los secundarios refuerzan ese entretenimiento, tanto las hermanas de ella como los socios de \u00e9l. Le di tres estrellas en mi primera lectura, pero le aumento una porque creo que la autora ha evolucionado en su estilo y lo merece, pues est\u00e1 encontrando ese punto de equilibrio entre la rom\u00e1ntica hist\u00f3rica cl\u00e1sica y la de cariz m\u00e1s moderno que atrae a las nuevas lectoras de rom\u00e1ntica, acostumbradas sobre todo al subg\u00e9nero contempor\u00e1neo. No es el estilo que a m\u00ed m\u00e1s me gusta, pero si as\u00ed consigue atraer m\u00e1s lectoras a la hist\u00f3rica, me parece genial. La recomiendo a todas las que os guste la novela rom\u00e1ntica."}, {"userName": "Dinjolina", "userReviewDate": "Sep 09, 2011", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/4438768-dinjolina", "userReview": "The books started out fabulously.

In this book, the Marquess of Bourne lost everything but his title in a gaming hell. His land, servants, clothes, everything was taken away from him. So Michael vows revenge; his aim to one day retrieve everything that was taken away from him.Ten years later, Michael is now one of the owners of London\u2019s most exclusive gaming hell. His life holds excitement and success, but there is still one thing that Michael wants desperately. He wants his land back. And he will do anything to gain it.However, when he learns that his land is now owned by The Marquess of Needham and Dolby and will be added to Lady Penelope Marbury\u2019s dowry, Michael makes it his personal goal to marry Penelope, just so he can gain back his land.For most of the book, Michael aka Bourne was a jerk. There were moments when I could appreciate his determination and ruthless perusal of something that was rightfully his, however, I did not see the reason why he was so mean to Penelope sometimes. They have a history. They were childhood friends who wrote letters to each other until their youth. These letters scattered throughout the book were sweet and highly entertaining, sometimes bringing a smile to my lips as I read them. But it was because of these letters that I felt that Penelope was often mistreated by Bourne. How could he totally disregard her after all they have been through?I am having a difficult time rating this book because there were scenes in this book that were brilliant, just absolutely thrilling and engaging. However, I did feel that towards the middle of the book, it lost some of its allure. The pacing wasn\u2019t always consistent, sometimes brilliant and sometimes a little lacklustre.But it was Penelope that really made this book for me. I loved her attitude towards life. She was quite sheltered, had a broken engagement and several disappointing courtships, but she was always opento anything. And that\u2019s a quality that I have to admire in a heroine.\"And, as she stood there, staring into the darkness, thinking on her future, she realized just how little she wanted a quiet life of pastel colors and quadrilles and tepid lemonade. She wanted more. The word whispered through her thoughts on a wave of sadness. More.\"Penelope was such a selfless woman, putting her own happiness on hold so that Bourne and her sisters could live the life they wanted. She would really wager it all for them.

I loved the writing voice, loved Penny and her family, and loved the friends-to-lover plot. But I didn't like Michael for much of the book, I didn't like the pacing of the romance as it went too quick, and I didn't like the revenge plot as it felt a bit forced. Overall, the story kept me engaged and entertained, but it didn't 'WOW' me. I will continue with the series as there is plenty about the men at the gaming Hell that has me interested for more."}, {"userName": "Lady Heather ", "userReviewDate": "Apr 24, 2011", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/2736715-lady-heather", "userReview": "Re-Read: January 12-13, 2018Ms. MacLean has done it again!!\nLOVED! LOVED! LOVED Penelope!Her strength, intelligence, courage, wit, loyalty, and her 'steel' to settle for nothing less than what she wanted...AMAZING!!.. and Lord Bourne Michael....WOW!!!He was everything a 'scoundrel' should be, and no matter how many times he tried to push Penelope away, she kept hoping to see a glimpse of the childhood friend she once knew.\nReading how they each played their cards, and waiting to see the others next move was amazing, gut-retching, and in the end fulfilling.Michael and Penelope's chemistry was sizzling, and with him, Penelope lost all her inhibitions and allowed herself to just feel and be in the moment. \nIn the end, this was such a beautiful story of redemption, forgiveness, healing, and love.\n Favorite Quote: \u201cI had a perfect life in my reach once, and it was a crashing bore. Perfect is too clean, too easy. I don't want perfect any more than I want to be perfect. I want imperfect.\u201d  Cannot wait to read Cross & Phillipa's story!"}, {"userName": "Duchess Nicole", "userReviewDate": "Oct 21, 2011", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/2204947-duchess-nicole", "userReview": "It was good. Not as good as Nine Rules or Eleven Scandals, but still a solid read. The epilogue itself was almost worth an extra star. At least the first part of it. It brought tears to my eyes. The second part is almost a 'to be continued' for the next couple, whose book comes out later this year.Penelope is a strong, patient woman. Much more patient than I could ever be, both with Leigton (from Eleven Scandals, remember, he broke their engagement), her father, and Bourne. She has literally been held in high esteem simply because her father is rich. Her broken engagement has lowered her place in society, and she is now fairly hopeless of ever marrying. So her father ups the stakes, and attaches a huge piece of land to her dowry. In steps Bourne, a close childhood friend and secret crush (even secret from herself) of Penelope's who has now become this bitter, hateful person.I tend to not prefer men who don't like themselves. There is a big difference between confidence in one's abilities- the fact that you know can accomplish something- and an utter disregard for the way your actions will affect yourself and people around you. For 9/10 of this book, Bourne simply didn't care who or what he hurt. He was so set on destroying those who took away his property and respect. Once he realizes what he has become, he spirals into a self-loathing pit of \"I don't deserve you!\"To be honest, if I were Penelope, I would have gone for one of Bourne's delicious sounding friends. Although that would negate the next book, I suppose. Still, I would not have waited him out for quite so long, and the groveling would have been a few more pages, at least.Though I hate 'to be continued' type novels, I am very excited to read the stories of the other owners of the Fallen Angel, which is who I assume the heroes will be."}, {"userName": "Alba M.

No es de los mejorcitos que he le\u00eddo pero me ha gustado bastante. Como siempre mis quejas PARA LA PROTAGONISTA, of course... lo que es ella, hasta el 90% del libro: una pusil\u00e1nime de cuidado. Creo que como ella, mucha gente no entiende que con el paso de los a\u00f1os todos cambiamos, y Pen\u00e9lope no parec\u00eda capaz de entender que Michael hab\u00eda cambiado. No, ella segu\u00eda empe\u00f1ada en tener al ni\u00f1o que una vez fue.
