I would have been in high school when this came out, but maybe because I was in a small mountain town in southern Alberta it wasn't on our curriculum.

Glaciologist. I'd never heard the word before. I'd never considered there might be others like him, scientists who studied only glaciers. I thought he was the one man on earth who bothered that much with them, that this science was his alone, that he had invented it. Arcturology. The science of being distant, and receding a little every year.The book takes place during the first two decades of the last century in what was to become Jasper National Park in Alberta, Canada. Byrne, a doctor, was exploring the region when he falls into into a crevasse on the Arcturus glacier. In the time it takes his group to notice his absence and haul him out, he sees something in the ice; a pale figure with huge wings. The image haunts him, even as he is rescued, revived and returned to London. Years later he is drawn back to the glacier and the book chronicles his life studying the ice and the other people who live for awhile at the hot springs hotel built at its foot. Evocative, poetic and strange, this is one of the most interesting books I've read this year.I will admit to a bias; I spent almost every childhood holiday in the area and have been up on the Athabasca glacier. Every place name was resonant with memory. It's a spectacularly beautiful, fragile area and Wharton's descriptions of the first residents of the region and the conditions under which they lived, a peculiar mixture of Victorian gentility and wilderness was fascinating. Alongside Byrne, Icefields tells the story of a poet come west to be a guide, a servant girl who takes charge of the running of a hotel and develops a relationship of sorts with Byrne, an intrepid female explorer and a tracker turned entrepreneur who sees opportunity in the coming railway."}, {"userName": "Cheryl Andrews", "userReviewDate": "Aug 16, 2010", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/4097436-cheryl-andrews", "userReview": "This book was a Canada Reads selection in 2008, defended by astronaut Steve MacLean.

I now want to read everything he\u2019s written since!I was as intrigued by the story as the author\u2019s writing style, as matter of fact and minimalistic as the opening line, \u201cAt a quarter past three in the afternoon, on August 17, 1898, Doctor Edward Byrne slipped on the ice of Arcturus Glacier in the Canadian Rockies and slid into a crevasse.\u201d The story that follows is about the 25-year quest Dr. Byrne undertakes to determine whether the form of an angel he saw frozen in the ice as he hung, wedged upside down in the narrowing walls of the chasm, fighting hypothermia and awaiting rescue, was real or imagined. Ned Byrne tells no one why he returns to the ice fields every spring, choosing to live alone in a hut on the ice and painstakingly calculating the position where he hopes to see the angel fall out of the receding glacier onto the rocks one day. A self-described jigsaw maker, Wharton ignored conventional narrative and put the book together from story fragments he\u2019d amassed, linking all the tales with and through the main protagonist, the cool and distant explorer from England. \u201cI\u2019ve discovered that\u2019s what works for me,\u201d Wharton says. \u201cWriting as a road of surprises.

I just finished it for the first time. This story is beautiful, and devastating. It's true what other people have written here, there is no \"plot\" to speak of here, the whole experience depends entirely on the characters, and the way they react to the events that effect them throughout the story.The greatest impressions I am left with are of the power of a single moment to give shape to an entire life, and the danger of obsession. The ending felt unsatisfying, the story feels incomplete and the conclusion has left me feeling cheated, but I think any 'satisfying' ending would be it's own cheat. This book creates a clear of a life I find completely believable, and too pat of an ending would break the spell. I would walk away, maybe satisfied with the narrative, but having missed something even more powerful.This story sets aside the safety and familiarity of narrative convention without drifting (in my eyes) into meaningless pretension, it creates a feeling wholly appropriate to the glacial setting: One cold and intriguing, majestic and mysterious, and most importantly it never loses sight of the characters who make it a story and not just a word painting. It is a rare and beautiful thing. I am glad I read it. I don't think I will ever forget it."}, {"userName": "rabbitprincess", "userReviewDate": "Nov 01, 2009", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/1093061-rabbitprincess", "userReview": "* * 1/2After 90 pages, I'm abandoning this book. When I first picked it up, I was looking forward to the descriptions of glaciers and the adventuring/mountaineering in Alberta at the end of the 19th/beginning of the 20th century. And the first part of the book certainly delivered, with a scientific expedition and one Dr. Byrne falling into a crevasse. However, once Byrne had recovered from that and the story moved on to other threads, I lost interest.It also did not help that the story is told in bite-sized chunks, each chunk encapsulating a single moment or incident. In the beginning this kind of worked, because it felt very immediate, but it also didn't work because it made the whole narrative feel rather choppy. So I think this is more a book that didn't work for me personally. If you like very episodic narratives and have a taste for the mountain wilderness of Alberta, you may like this more than I did.One thing I did really like about this book was the cover of my edition. Absolutely gorgeous. That's what the extra half-star in my rating is for.This book was featured on the 2008 edition of Canada Reads and was defended by astronaut Steve Maclean."}, {"userName": "Al", "userReviewDate": "Aug 17, 2008", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/733624-al", "userReview": "We just returned from a hiking vacation in Banff and vicinity. While there, I was in a bookstore and asked the proprietor to recommend something uniquely Canadian. This was her suggestion, and it was a good one. The protagonist is a doctor who first visits Jasper in 1898 as a young man, where he has a traumatic and life-changing experience, falling into a crevasse while ice-climbing. He survives, and is haunted by an image he saw in the ice while waiting (hoping) to be rescued. The book follows him, and several other characters, through the next 25 years, as he returns year after year from his home in England to seek peace and resolution of his internal conflicts by studying the glaciers of the region. I really didn't expect much from this book, but it is beautifully done. Perhaps it would be of more interest to those who have either been in Jasper or done ice-climbing, or both, but I found it interesting even though I have done neither. I don't know if it's even available in the US, but if you're interested in it, let me know and I'll loan you mine."}, {"userName": "Sue Q", "userReviewDate": "Oct 25, 2015", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/7047875-sue-q", "userReview": "Borrowed from the Ontario Library Service ConsortiumThis book was like a dream, combining both fact and fiction. It told the story of life on ice near Jasper at a time that developers were competing to bring the railway and roads in, while the environmentalist tried to study and protect the melting glaciers. Added in was a story of something that was glimpsed - angel like - while hanging upside down in an ice crevice and the methodical planning and researching of ice to see when the ice would be melted for the \"something\" to break free. It left anticipation while reading, but also engulfed me with the history of the area, including a war. The ending still left enough mystery to wonder and ponder. I loved the main character (the one hanging upside down that started it all) and how he was a collector of botanical seeds to preserve for futures to come. Had me thinking of the world a bit differently and I started noticing articles of frozen seed banks - which was very cool. Books do that, don't they? Open your eyes.

The author depicts the power of nature to draw men back again and again to see what will be revealed to them with the passage of time, and touches on the spiritual identity of the landscape.The main character, Dr. Byrne, is enthralled by the icefields, and spends his life trying to replicate or revisit an early experience of their power. The attention to detail paid to the areas' unique geography made me feel very Canadian, and I empathised with Byrne's efforts to find others who shared his passion for the landscape. The writer assumes all readers will share in this passion and he goes into great detail about the movement of the ice, making for a somewhat tenacious, one dimensional read. The twist is that this style perfectly mirrors the character of Byrne, and this characters' unwavering tenacity leads him to the answers he had been seeking."}, {"userName": "Christy", "userReviewDate": "Apr 18, 2009", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/39443-christy", "userReview": "Of everything I enjoyed the imagery and the italics of this book. The italics were different peoples poetry or journal entries throughout. They were personalized, raw and didn't always make sense until I read them again. Ordinarily that would frustrate me but in this book it intrigued me.The imagery was appealing because of course it's an entire book about ice. How many different ways can one describe their surroundings when they are surrounded by ice? Well, you'd be surprised my friends. My trouble is the open end. There isn't enough of a plot or development to warrant a sequel and yet the end is left open like you should be expecting one. Though I can't imagine any type of sequel would be more than a chapter long. The entire book is a journey, a search for something one researcher saw a decade ago when he fell into an ice crevase.

I do know that Doctor Byrne (an Englishman) returned to Jasper years later and was studying the glaciers.

The delivery of the story with short sections of plot that flip-flop between characters make the story difficult to follow. The writing is modern and assumes that the reader is immersed enough in the text to be able to envision the details of the story.
