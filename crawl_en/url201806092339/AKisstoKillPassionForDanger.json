In comparison with the previous books, there weren\u2019t as many action scenes as expected here. But anyway, I had an adrenaline rush when all hell broke loose near the end of the book. So much went on that I felt like my heart would jump out of my chest.It\u2019s not hard to feel satisfied by the conclusion of the series because all the loose ends were all wrapped up nicely. However, I wish the author would give me some more details or insight into the villains\u2019 motives. The big reveal at the end of this book came as a shock to me. From the very start of this series, there was no dropping of any hint as to who the real traitor was, so when all the truth was out in the open, I couldn\u2019t even believe what I just read. But somehow, despite this, the disclosure felt a bit rushed to me.The romance between the main couple, Gregg and Gina, was mind-blowingly wonderful. Gregg was such an amazing alpha man. Normally I\u2019m not quite into tortured heroes, but Gregg just simply pushed my right buttons. His protectiveness alone was enough to make me fall head over heels for him. And about Gina, considering what she had been through, it was a miracle she could stay strong. It took so much bravery and strength for her to trust Gregg again and ultimately let him help her overcome her captivity trauma. Aww\u2026I loved this couple.\n\u201cSweet thing, if I\u2019d wanted to hurt you, I\u2019d already have done so,\u201d he said reasonably.Her eyes cut up to him from the table. \u201cDon\u2019t call me that.\u201dHe stifled a sting in his heart. She used to like it when he called her sweet thing. So did he. Because she was. Incredibly sweet. Sweet sounding, sweet tasting, sweet smelling, sweet looking. She was the sweet and soft to everything hard and bitter inside him.Even now, with her beautiful dark eyes filled with such loathing and suspicion, she was still the sweetest thing he\u2019d ever seen.\nMy biggest problem about this book was that there was too much pushing away. I must admit, I had high hopes for Alex and Rebel\u2019s love story since I read the first book, but in this installment, Alex drove me crazy with his I-am-not-good-enough-for-you issues. As you know, I hate push/pull relationship and in this case, Alex totally failed me. He came across more like a jerk to me. Rebel wasn\u2019t much better than him. She was an inch away from being a doormat, and damn, I\u2019m not a fan of doormat heroines! I don\u2019t understand why didn\u2019t she just walk out on him? She was better off alone, for crying out loud!Nevertheless, this was a very entertaining read. Once I started reading it, I just couldn\u2019t stop. I highly recommend this series to fans of romantic suspense stories.\n\u201cYou\u2019re safe with me, Gina,\u201d he whispered roughly. \u201cI swear to you, no one will ever hurt you again. Not as long as I\u2019m still breathing.\u201d"}, {"userName": "Dina", "userReviewDate": "May 21, 2010", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/1918270-dina", "userReview": "3 1/2 starsBased on the previous books in the series, I had no doubt that suspension of disbelief was a must if I wanted to enjoy this read. As expected, this book had several eye-rolling moments, but I was braced for them so I had fun with all the OTT action. It was exciting and entertaining, so I won't complain about it. As I mentioned before, I like the suspense part of this series. Ms. Bruhns has the knack for writing thrilling action scenes, there's no question about it.Unfortunately, it was the romance part that fell flat in this book - again... There were too many couples and storylines going on at the same time, and one got in the way of the other. I might as well repeat what I wrote in my review of the previous book (with a few adjustments, since some of the couples changed from one book to another): I'm sorry to say, the romance didn't work that well for me. It wasn't the lack of it; on the contrary, there were three romances going on in the book: Gregg/Gina, Alex/Rebel and Wade/Sarah/Rebel/Gina/a mysterious affair from his past. Wade's story was a mess, as I couldn't figure out who he cared for. It was all too much and none of them had enough \"screen time\" to be developed the way they should have been. Based on the book description, Gregg and Gina were the H/h, but that's not the impression I got while reading the book because the other romances had as many pages/scenes as theirs. The way it was, Ms. Bruhns couldn't make me connect with any of the characters.Besides the three romances, there was also the \"main\" storyline that glued everything together: the search for the Government mole(s) who had betrayed the country and might be planning a new terrorist attack. That was the book's saving grace, as I really enjoyed the several plot twists and turns and the final showdown. Great stuff there!Overall, this was a better than average read to me, but not enough to make me bump my rating to 4 stars. Like the previous books, it was too busy and crowded, which prevented me from getting to know and understand the characters well enough to love them, but it was fun.Note on the series: These books must be read in order, preferably back to back because more than one storyline begins in the 1st book, is developed through the 2nd, only to end in the 3rd. You won't be lost if you start the series in the middle because Ms. Bruhns gives enough info to help you through the journey, but take it from me: I found it hard to connect with the characters and I knew them from the start; I can only imagine how I'd feel about them if I didn't."}, {"userName": "Shawna", "userReviewDate": "Aug 01, 2009", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/1802746-shawna", "userReview": "5+ stars \u2013 Romantic SuspenseWOW!

This story focuses more heavily on CIA black ops agent, Gregg Van Halen (no relation, as he quickly pointed out in book 1) and Gina Cappozi, a scientist who has been working to develop a way to inoculate children through a nasal inhalation device, as opposed to injections. Because of her work with new ways to dispense drugs, chemicals, etc., she was taken and held hostage by the terrorists who wanted her to develop a way that their biological weapon could be easily released in a crowded, public forum \u2013 thus causing the most death. As the story we\u2019ve followed through the first two book comes to an end, our heroes and heroines are racing against the clock to discover the identity of the government official who has turned traitor and put millions of lives at risk by assisting those ruthless terrorists who are still planning the biological attack on US soil. This traitor has another surprise in store for our characters \u2013 he/she is also plotting the assignation of the President of the United States.It was great watching as all the couples finally found their happily ever afters and thwarted the terrorists and traitors hell bent on killing as many people as possible thus saving us all from a painful death by ugly black, oozing blisters \u2013 those just sound nasty!!!As I\u2019ve said before, if you can get past some of the not-likely-to-happen events, suspending your disbelief for just awhile, you\u2019d probably enjoy these books.Note - This is one of those trilogies that, in order to really understand and get the most enjoyment out of, really should be read in order.The books in this trilogy and their reading order are:1.\tShoot to Thrill2.\tIf Looks Could Chill3.\tA Kiss to Kill"}, {"userName": "Buggy", "userReviewDate": "Apr 10, 2010", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/3099666-buggy", "userReview": "Opening Line: \u201cThey were using her as bait.\u201dOh I liked this one and I agree with others that this is the best of the Passion For Danger trilogy. Its like Bruhns finally got the formula right here with each character getting just the right amount of page time, an exciting but not over-the-top storyline and the perfect balance of action/suspense to romance. It could also be said though that I\u2019ve gotten used to her style and didn\u2019t expect to read exclusively about just one couple. I actually enjoyed the multiple romances taking place this time around and since I\u2019ve read these back to back (thanks to advice from other reviews) I was also seriously invested in the characters and seeing them through to their HEA\u2019s. All in all this was a great read that I was sad to see come to an end. Theres some excellent action scenes; Rebel and Alex diving the \u201cAllah\u2019s Paradise\u201d wreck during one of his flashbacks (yikes) and quite a few LOL funny moments including male bonding \u201cfist bumps\u201d and the continued witty banter between agents. The love scenes remain heartfelt and super steamy with just the right amount of alpha maleness thrown in. I should mention that in order to fully appreciate the back story and romantic build up involved here this series should be read in order, as almost all of the characters stories began in book #1(Shoot to Thrill) and are only now are seeing through to their conclusions. Pegged as Gina and Gregg\u2019s book -although as I said all the couples receive equal page time, this couple met eight months ago. Back then scientist Dr Gina Cappozi and black-ops agent Gregg Van Halen were (fantastic) lovers until Gregg committed the ultimate betrayal, turning Gina over to the hands of the terrorists. Tortured for several months, while they utilized her bio chemical talents to perform acts of terrorism Gina was rescued in the last book (A Kiss to Kill) and has now made it her mission to kill the man she once loved. Of course that wouldn\u2019t be any fun especially now that she\u2019s being targeted by kidnappers again and it seems that Gregg is the only one who can help her. Even if he is slightly controlling, in and out of the bedroom.This is however only one of several ongoing plotlines we also get; Alex and Rebel who have finally gotten it together, although he has a few surprises about why they can\u2019t stay that way and newcomer detective Sarah McPhee and rebound specialist Wade Montana. Hmm, more secrets there too. While all the love is going on the agents are still running around trying to discover the identity (didn\u2019t see that coming) of the person responsible for the terrorist attacks and also to stop \u201cthe trigger\u201d from killing the president. All these subplots blend well this time into a fast paced romantic thriller.

There are loads of excellent reviews out there and I am feeling a little lazy :) but just wanted to quickly add one thing. Like the second we followed 3 different couples in the story and I did feel that the book was a bit 'crowded' and would have been better if each couple (or maybe 2 couple's at a time) had got their own book. I understand that would have been difficult due to the timeline and overall events of the story but each book could have been from the couple's prospective adding new information for the reader as it progressed.Overall I did enjoy the series and will continue to read books by Ms Bruhn."}, {"userName": "jenjn79", "userReviewDate": "Nov 08, 2009", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/946249-jenjn79", "userReview": "Kick ass book (from a kick ass series). Once I started reading this one, I did not want to put it down. I just wanted to sit there until I finished. I was totally and absolutely hooked into it from the very start.Series Note:This series MUST be read in order.Summary:Geneticist Gina Cappozi's life has been a roller coaster for the past year. First her best friend disappears, then she meets a mysterious sexy guy and starts a blazing affair with him...then he betrays her (or so she believes) and she's captured by terrorists and tortured for months. Now she's physically healed and out for blood. Gregg van Halen's blood, to be exact. But when they finally meet up again, Gina is forced to realize that maybe he's not the bad guy she thought he was...unfortunately, someone still wants both of them dead.At the same time, STORM Corps agent Alex Zane is heading back into the field for the first time since being rescued from a terrorist camp in Sudan. Right off the bat he finds himself thrown together with FBI agent Rebel Haywood as they try to find out who is after Gina. Rebel's been in love with Alex for years, but he keeps pushing her away. But as they must work together, Alex can't help back any longer. The two have a lot to work through, though, if they want to find happiness.Review:What to say about this book? It's got a little of just about everything I love in a good romantic suspense. A tense, engaging plot, great characters, fantastic romance, some steamy sex...all of which had me anxious to get back to the book whenever I had to put it down. I loved this book, and I loved the series on the whole. Absolutely fantastic.This series really needs to be read in order, for anyone considering it. Everything between the three books is very tied together...plots, romances, characters, events. I think you'd end up a bit confused if you skipped around. I've read all three and I kept wishing I'd read them closer together as I read this one, that's how tied together the details are.In this book, the al Sayika terrorist plot comes to a head as the group from STORM Corps, along with some FBI, some Metro PD, some Zero Unit and some other agents try to figure out who the traitor is who is putting them all in danger. It's a plot that goes in a lot of directions because there are so many characters and groupings. It kept me on the edge of my seat wondering what would happen next, who the bad guy was, how it would all play out. I must admit I was a bit surprised at the end as to the identity of the bad guy(s). And that last scene...the big plot climax...whew. That was tense. Excellently done by the author. I was just so hooked into the plot of this book, all the series arcs, the book plot...all of it was great.Adding to all that were the characters and the romance. Gina and Gregg...fantastic couple. So much chemistry and heat. And okay, Gregg sounded like a hunk and a half ;) But they were great together. As were Alex and Rebel. This romance sorted started back in book one (as Gina and Gregg's did) and everything between them finally comes to a head in this book. These two are so meant for each other, but everything is working against them. Poor Alex, the man has been through so much. Over a year being tortured by terrorists, now he's got the PTSD to prove it. And Rebel...kick ass girl. I liked her. She was absolutely perfect for Alex. Between these two romances, it made the book even between. Plus, there's a mini romance for Wade, Gina's ex.Then there's the sex...very steamy. It's not a book for the prudish sort. It's moderately graphic, with some explicit language, and also the inclusion of some non-vanilla sexual themes (bondage, dominance). So keep that in mind. But yeah, sexy scenes. And don't get me started on the tattoo thing... I have no words...Was the book perfect? No. I give it five stars because I thought it was an awesome book. But it did have a few flaws. As I mentioned in at least one of the other books, character development could use some work. The characters are very much set in the moment and you really get little sense of their pasts and who they were before the books started. Leaves them a little one dimensional at times. There were also a few details here and there between books that didn't quite match up. But I didn't have any major complaints (obviously).I'd highly, highly recommend this series to romantic suspense fans...especially those of you who like spec ops stories and the like. I loved all three books. I hope the author gets the opportunity to continue this series, or to write another like it. I would definitely read them!"}, {"userName": "Kathrynn", "userReviewDate": "May 10, 2010", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/669573-kathrynn", "userReview": "Another page turner! Book #3 in the Passion for Danger series picked up right were #1 and #2 left off so be sure to read this series in order because the back stories and build-up are in the earlier books. In the first book, Shoot to Thrill, we got a few splashes of Gina Cappazi and Gregg van Halen's tale. Oh my! In the second book, If Looks Could Chill, their saga further developed with some intense scenes that involved abduction, torture and biological weapons. In book 3 (this one), Gina and Gregg become the main characters, and it starts off and goes. As with the first 2 books in the series, this one had several other stories running through it and updates on previous characters. Alex Zane (Christopher Alexander Zane) and Rebel Hayward played a large role here and I wasn't too thrilled with their saga. Alex had problems, true, but when a person has been carrying a torch for someone for so long....His rational\u00e9 got on my nerves. The posturing over Rebel got old, too. He wanted his cake and eat it, too, but acted very immature. One overall theme that seemed to carry through the entire series that I didn't care for was how the men screwed the women into senseless oblivion. The women all caved when the men forced themselves on them and I'd like to see that backed away from in future books. Also, it irritated the hell out of me that the women, whether police detectives, FBI, STORM, etc were always \"serving the coffee.\" Got a kick out of Metro Police Detective Sarah McPhee! Hope to read more about her in later books. She had an \"older woman/younger man\" theme going on and she was in complete control of her actions. Great sense of humor, too. Would like to have read more of her back story....Got a sense there would be more in this series and there are certainly plenty of characters with the local police, FBI, CIA and STORM characters all working together--mostly. Excellent writing and how the overall plot was weaved was nicely done. The suspense was superb! Some funny scenes here and there, but mostly hot, romantic suspense.

Once again the action was really good, the characters were great and the heat was there. I really liked that I had NO idea who the bad guy's where until the end.

I think Gina was realistic, considering what she's been through. After having most of the other women in this series be superhero cops and special agents, I liked that Gina was a normal woman I felt I could identify with.I love romantic suspense that actually bothers to have a suspense plot, and this is one of those books.

Gina is in trouble again, well, not really again, as much as still. The big bad behind the whole larger plot of the previous 2 books and this one is trying to tie up the loose ends. Those loose ends being Kick, Alex, and Gina, all of whom have a target on their head.Gina is still trying to come to terms with Gregg's betrayal, when he pops back in her life and things become even more complicated. The team quickly comes together to protect her, which brings even more complications. Gina has to face some old ghosts and seems to find the same difficulties that all the other female members of these books have.Alex and Rebel are thrown together, their attraction still red hot. Each one of them has their own issues and seeing them lay them out and work through them is fun. Alex, like most guys, seems to make a lot of mistakes along the way. Wade is hanging around and again I am not sure just where his loyalties lie. With each new piece of evidence if found it either condemns him or redeems him, the bad part is that they keep finding things and you aren't sure.With all the twists and turns you just aren't sure who to trust and who the bad guys are.

But I\u2019ve already done the deed after reading A Kiss to Kill. This is my first book in Ms. Bruhns\u2019 Passion for Danger series, and I loved every darned word of it. I want more. Now.Gina Capozzi is finally recovered from her torturous ordeal at the hands of terrorists, and how she\u2019s as angry as can be and is out for the blood of her former lover, rogue CIA operative Greg Van Halen. He\u2019s the one who betrayed her, left her in the hands of those who turned her over to the bastards who nearly beat her to death after forcing her to create a deadly chemical for their twisted use.She knows he\u2019s out there watching her. All she needs is a chance to get close to him and she\u2019ll let her new-found skill take care of the rest. What she doesn\u2019t know is Greg isn\u2019t the only one following her. She\u2019s working with her friends and their colleagues from STORM, the highly specialized group hired to root out the terrorists, to lure Greg into the open, but she ends up in Greg\u2019s hands before anyone else can get to her.He\u2019s determined to find out why he was sent out of the country so Gina\u2019s handlers could do their dirty work that very easily could have, and probably should have, lead to her demise. Greg knows Gina blames him for the brutality she suffered, but he\u2019s not the one who betrayed her and he\u2019s going to make damn sure she knows it. He\u2019s also going to have her in his bed again, no matter what.Greg and Gina are one of the hottest couples I\u2019ve read lately. They have a connection that can\u2019t be broken. They know each other so intimately that once they are together again, their innate trust and love in one another has always been there, they just have to learn to hold onto it in the face of any further danger and betrayal. They are definitely tested again later in the book, and I nearly screamed when it looked like things may not work out for them.I also like the two secondary stories we get. Alex is a STORM agent who has also been tortured by terrorists, and he\u2019s in love with CIA agent Rebel Haywood, who has been loaned to STORM when it\u2019s found their cases are closely related. Alex refuses to act on his feelings for Rebel for his own reasons, but she won\u2019t put up with his nonsense for too long.Sarah McPhee is a DC Metro police officer and she\u2019s heading up a murder that turns out to also be related to STORM\u2019s case, but she also has to deal with sexy CIA agent Wade Montana, who is unofficially nosing around for information. Sarah is interested in him, but when it looks like he may be illicitly involved in the whole thing, she feels she should have known better.There\u2019s not one thing I didn\u2019t like about this took. It\u2019s fast paced. It\u2019s got an intriguing and complex story and mystery. It\u2019s got fascinating characters on every page. It\u2019s sexy and sensual and then some. I just ordered the first two books in the series and I can\u2019t wait to get to them.

Vengeance against Captain Gregg van Halen, it's what she lives for. By all appearances, Gina is safe, secure and resuming her life in New York while STORM operatives watch over her hoping to catch Gregg. Gina vows to herself she won't take an easy breath as long as Gregg takes any. Gregg's aware he's a wanted man but can't seem to stay away from Gina as he watches and waits. While their romance or relationship or whatever it was going on between them, it wasn't the only romantic focus and this reader felt it was easy to get lost in the reason for the outing. For my taste this final outing was too invested in the romance threads and didn't do complete justice to the other pieces. There were many almost vignettes or novellas going on, such as, monitoring Gina, Gina/Greg relationship, Gina's monitors; the Alex, Rebel, Wade, Helen double triangle, the Alex/Rebel relationship; Wade sexcapades featuring Rebel, Sarah, Gina, mystery woman from the past, ad nauseam was a full time job. Dez got short sheeted, tracking Gina's captors and not enough time devoted to the traitor with STORM inserted as an afterthought it was all too much. I'm fine with a busy read but no one thread came across as the focus for the story. I had difficulty caring what happened anywhere between any characters and there were as many pages devoted to the action/adventure/drama pieces as to the individual romances until I stopped caring. I just wanted to be done. The busyness coupled with the much too outrageous situations led to many opportunities for eye-rolls and exasperated sighs at how OTT action unfolded. However, the action and adventure pieces didn't disappoint in terms of tasks and getting the job done and actually led to a good wrap of loose ends."}, {"userName": "Michelle the Romance Witch", "userReviewDate": "Sep 10, 2012", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/4079332-michelle-the-romance-witch", "userReview": "With all the different POVs, relationships, and conspiracy theories in this story, and the whole series, you can often find yourself feeling that the love story has been pushed aside for the action and intrigue. Though the novels were good I doubt I\u2019ll read them again or try any of Nina\u2019s other series. I much prefer one main romance in my novels, though I have read some well-done ones with secondary romances in the background. This seems more like she was trying to have too many couples coming together in too short of a series. I think if you count as you read the series something like six or seven couples came together in just three books along with all the terrorist plots, kidnappings, and police investigations.

Although \nA Kiss To Kill\n was chock full of blazing action, nail-biting suspense, frustrating romance and heated sensuality, it was not as intense as the previous book. Having read the books back-to-back it was, thus, a bit of a let down. Part of the problem could be that Bruhns did such a phenomenal job with her misdirection, it was mortifying to be so far off the mark when it came to identifying the villain.Although it will not become a favorite style, Bruhns wrote another triple romance in one book. The featured couple was Zero Unit's Captain Gregg van Halen and Dr. Gina Cappozi. The very strongly-featured secondary couple was Alex Zane and FBI Special Agent Rebel Haywood. Thirdly, a minor romance between Special Agent in Charge Wade Montana and Metro PD Detective Sarah McPhee was developed.\nA Kiss To Kill\n was tied to the other two books of the trilogy by featuring Bobby Lee Quinn as the STORM Commander leading the same basic team in their continued search for the traitor who framed Gregg for kidnapping Gina. It was great to get to re-visit with Darcy Zimmerman; Kick Jackson and Rainie Martin; and Marc Lafayette and Tara Reeves as they set up their headquarters in Washington D.C.'s Watergate Hotel.Another successful writing technique that many romantic suspense authors seem to utilize to keep the readers enthralled and intrigued is jumping from one sequence of events to another (usually featuring a different character's point of view). While this technique is necessary to tell a cohesive story about how three couples separately work to find the same villain, it is a bit frustrating at times. It seems that Bruhns has done such a great job creating these strong, fascinating characters, she would have been better served to have written six more richly developed books giving the readers more background and emotional details about each couple featured in this trilogy. (But Bruhns probably wasn't offered a six-book deal from her publisher!)Romance One: - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - -Dr. Gina Cappozi has been released from her stay at STORM's Haven Oaks Sanatorium where she recovered after her horrific ordeal as a captive of the terrorist group al Sayika. She is currently serving as bait (under the watchful eyes of STORM Corp. operatives) to draw out the U.S. mole who is feeding information to al Sayika. Gina has trained to exact her own revenge on her ex-lover, whom she has long and loudly proclaimed as the man who betrayed her and handed her over to terrorists.Gregg, however, has been proving his ability to be a ub\u00ebr-alpha, well-trained, shadowy operative by following Gina to keep her safe. Gregg's mission is two-fold. He wants to find the man who not only hurt his ex-lover (someone who was drawing him from his world of darkness into the light), but framed him for the deed. He wants his honor and his job back (and he wishes that he could have Gina back, but he knows her hatred is too intense).When three al Sayika terrorists try to kill Gina on the streets of Manhattan, it is Gregg who saves her. Gregg then kidnaps Gina, takes her to his apartment {how could he still have an unfindable apartment?}, and tries to convince her that he did not betray her. Gregg was tormented because Gina believes he is capable of such an atrocity.After saving his life, Gregg mentored a young Zero Unit Team member, Tommy, who is helping him with inside information. Tommy arranges a meeting for the man Gregg suspects is the mole, his commander, Colonel Frank Blair. Bruhns is so clever creating this scene in which Blair cannot just pull his gun and arrest Gregg on the spot.Bruhns has Gina turn to Gregg in a half-awake state to facilitate their reunion. Although it was disappointing that Gregg and Gina could not have the same kind of hot monkey sex that they engaged in back in Book One (\nShoot To Thrill\n), she did manage to titillate readers with heated, spicy, yet emotionally-driven love scenes between these strong protagonists.Gina eventually realizes that Gregg did not betray her and joins him in his search for the traitor. Colonel Blair had revealed that someone on Capitol Hill could be the traitor, so he and Gina head to Washington, D.C. and stay at (of course) Watergate Hotel. Gregg's amazing control and aloofness are demonstrated when he and Gina accidentally end up joining the STORM team.Romance Two: - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - -This book felt more like it should be Alex and Rebel's story. Alex has joined the STORM team and has a flashback of his capture during his first assignment (protecting Dr. Cappozi). When Alex balks at being reassigned to work with the FBI and Coast Guard to investigate a suspect yacht in Chesapeake Bay, Bobby Lee tells Alex he shouldn't be on the team if they have to tip-toe around him.There were quite a few instances in which Bobby Lee pulled no punches with Alex; mostly in telling him to get his love life in order so he wouldn't sabotage the operation. It was actually kind of humorous that Alex was constantly thinking things like \"does the whole team know how I feel about Rebel?\" And to borrow from Bruhns writing style, \"well, duh!\"Rebel gets her first blazing, \"it's about time\" kiss from Alex aboard the Coast Guard's response boat right after she prevents the boarding team from getting blow to pieces by the bomb planted on Allah's Paradise>. Alex and Rebel's happily-ever-after is hampered by each protagonist. First, in a totally confusing about-face, Rebel is no longer sure she wants to pursue a relationship with the man she has loved the last five years. Second, would have to be a man to understand why Alex has been keeping himself away from the woman we all know he has been wanting for at least the past two years. He believes his reasons are valid, but romance readers everywhere are surely thinking \"love (and Rebel) doesn't care about that.\"Naturally, Alex and Rebel must spend time together as they continue their investigation of the sunken yacht. As expected, they finally make soul-searing, hot, magically intense love. Bruhns does know how to write spicy, engrossing love scenes. Thankfully, that is not the only time Alex and Rebel make heated, \"can't keep my hands off you\" love. Bruhns did a great job of validating the reasons Alex and Rebel were reluctant to pursue a future together, but sometimes it felt too contrived, too unrealistic for two people who have been in unrequited love with the other for so long. Just wish that they hadn't had so many obstacles to overcome in their already angst-ridden relationship.Romance Three: - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - -D.C. Metro Police Detective Sarah McPhee is introduced as a world-wise woman investigating the death of a woman who has ties to terrorists. And, surprise, surprise, hunky, sexy, unrelentingly determined FBI Special Agent Wade Montana shows up to charm information from her. Found it curious that Wade was able to keep his regular job with the amount of time he spends on this unofficial investigation.Wade came across as so sleazy. (Probably because he was never given a point of view thought during the entire three-book series.) A man who used his \"women fall at my feet\" good looks and charm to became involved in these \"Gina Cappozi\" investigations. During the whole \"let me be part of your investigation\" scenarios, it was a relief whenever smart, \"I know what you're up to\" Sarah would not succumb to Wade's charm. Thought Bruhns metaphors about Sarah's internal red flags flipping back and forth whenever Wade attempts to use sex to gain information was priceless.Even more surprising, Wade and Sarah never make love. But Sarah does find out that Wade is an amazing kisser. And she finds out that he doesn't like STORM Corp.'s involvement with her investigation. Bruhns is nothing, if not imaginative, in keeping Wade involved with a woman and involved in the story of the search for the traitor.A Kiss To Kill is a wonderful finale to The Passion For Danger Trilogy. It is a book that keeps the readers attention from the moment one reads the first page until the final sentence. It is not, however, a stand-alone read. There is just too much background information in the previous two books. In that regard, it would be difficult to recommend this book as a must-read without recommending the entire trilogy. Readers who like Suzanne Brockmann and Tara Janzen will really like this trilogy.Note: Triple romances leave room for undeveloped plots that result is questions like: {1} Why did Helena (all the sudden) change her mind about marrying Alex? {2} What are details of incident that resulted in Sarah not making Lieutenant? {3} How did Wade manage to keep his job -- he spent so much time working on a case not assigned to him? {4} What made the villain turn traitor? {5} What made the villain choose Gregg to be the fall guy?"}, {"userName": "Bindi Boo ", "userReviewDate": "Aug 22, 2017", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/32333382-bindi-boo", "userReview": "3.75 starsAn action-packed suspense with a side of second chance romance.

He left her to be physically and mentally tortured by terrorists for the next eight months and never looked back. Now they are the main characters and Gina is out for revenge. They cross paths again and realize not all is over between them. Besides her planning to kill Gregg, sticking close and Gregg making sure to keep his eyes on Gina, this book is an onslaught of revelations.I was really surprised at what he did to Gina so I was anticipating it to be good. Being a black ops Captain, Gregg must keep back emotions that could jeopardize the mission even at the cost of the woman he cares for. We get the real reason why he did what he did, but the first parts of the book was frustrating. In fact, there was a lot of things going on, including sideplots and another couple. We keep switching back forth so it didn't work well with me. When Gina and Gregg quickly reunite, there lots of snarling, verbal jabs, mistrust and apparently still sexual tension. Gina is also on a mission and the sideplot in the last book is expanded and continued. Their relationship just had a little heat to be rekindled. I was interested because of the way they left things, but it fell flat. Gina torn, emotionally and physically made me want to smack her a few times and I guess Gregg was okay. Like I said, others are thrown in the mix that it was too much.Alex and Rebel somehow managed to get a nice tie for their end as they are the side couple. While I liked them, all their drama just weighed down the book.

I still think these books are marketed poorly, and don't *quite* match what's on the back cover, but at least the love story between Gregg and Gina was more than a passing fancy this time around (*cough* Marc and Tara). All the loose ends were tied up neatly, and I felt good with where it ended. It's too bad Rebel and Alex's story was competing for attention; just like with Darcy and Bobby Lee in the last book, their story was interwoven within everything else, and just like Darcy and Bobby Lee, it was a compelling story line. I actually like Nina Bruhns general storytelling style; I just wish these two couples had been given their own books. Their stories were as strong or stronger than the \"main characters\" of the books they were in, so having an entire book to themselves would have been great and seeing a little more of STORM would have been nice, too. That being said, the way they were woven into the story was incredibly well done. I can't remember the last time I was so engaged with supporting characters.Still, I'd probably recommend this trilogy to a friend, with two conditions: 1) they have to be read together and in order, and 2) do not to read the back of the books. 3.5 stars."}, {"userName": "Lana \u2747\u273eDirty Girl Romance\u2747\u273e", "userReviewDate": "Aug 29, 2011", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/5498948-lana-dirty-girl-romance", "userReview": "I was desperately looking for another author to fill in the void for Romantic Suspense when my favorite series by Roxanne St Claire, Cindy Gerard and Christy Reece came to an end.I happened to stumble on to Nina Bruhns based on pure chance, and figured what the heck.Boy am I glad I did!
