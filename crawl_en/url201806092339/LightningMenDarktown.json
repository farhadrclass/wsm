I really don't think so, and it was a bit surreal to be in the midst of 1950's racist America while the Charlottesville news coverage was ticking away in the background. Up front, I'd like to state that I abhor racism in all it's forms; if it bothers you that I value all life as equal I encourage you to unfollow this account. Books with content addressing racism are tricky; on the one hand the issue needs to be discussed in depth to push progress forward, but on the other I feel like so many only show black people in the state of slavery and oppression. I truly believe the day is coming where minorities are protagonists in our mainstream literature on a regular basis and are being featured in all the plots that have been peppered with lack of color for so long. That being said, THIS book somehow found the perfect balance of remembrance of wrong doing and much needed progression in it's characters that is so hard to find. While this book read well as a standalone, I have to say I'm itching to go back and read the first novel, Darktown just for the sheer characterization I missed. One of the things that really hit me while reading was the segregation in the housing situations, both past and present. The \"Great White Flight\" is truly no myth and the fact that the author was able to weave outright, violent racism with present, underhanded racism astounded me. The characters were completely relatable and fleshed out in a way that made them feel real and present, even with the time period standing between us. Please understand, this book is not subtle or easy to read in any way, but it was exactly what needed to be told, even if in fictional form. I'm hoping to add more thoughts to this as I process, but this book wrecked me in a way that nothing has for quite awhile now. This is a time that we need to talk about hard things, not only to reach out a hand of solidarity to our minority friends, but also to instill basic humanity in the upcoming generations on the value of all human life. *********************Won in a Goodreads Giveaway!

Once again, Mullen has done a superb job of painting a picture of 1950s Atlanta and its casual racism on all levels - legal, political and social. People actually thought segregation was \u201cthe natural order of things\u201d. What's sad is how there now appear to be so many parallels with the present situation, right down to the fascist groups spreading their hate. In fact, the title refers to the lightning bolts they use as their symbol. There are two storylines. Boggs and Smith intercept a moonshine operation delivering the goods into the Negro neighborhoods. The second plot involves Dale, Rake\u2019s idiot brother in law, who gets himself in a real predicament when he takes on a KKK \u201cassignment\u201d. There is a dry sense of humor here that I don't remember from the first book. As a retired banker, and one who was involved in community reinvestment activities, it was interesting to read about the actions that necessitated CRA. The characters are fully developed. Mullen deals with both the personal lives of the police officers as well as their professional lives. As the book progresses, these stories intermingle. And the writing, OMG, the writing! \u201cJust another fellow who was more muscle than brains, more temper than thought, more bad luck than good.\u201d When my husband used to watch boxing, he would move along with the fighters. Well, there was a fight scene in this book so realistic I was ducking and weaving along with the participants. This is just an amazing book. The ending is a force of nature. So many moving parts, taking you in directions you never imagined. There better be a book three!I\u2019m willing to bet this book will also end up in my top ten for 2017."}, {"userName": "Diane S \u2614", "userReviewDate": "Oct 04, 2017", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/4159922-diane-s", "userReview": "Atlanta, 1950,s a few years after Mullens book, Darktown, and all the characters are back in force. Smith and Boggs are still only a few black officers on the force, with little power and little support. Color lines are beginning to blur a bit, and of course with the white population, this does not sit well. Embedded prejudices, the KKK, and Nazi supporters are out in force, the KKK more underground since an FBI investigation,but still working behind the scenes. Drugs and moonshine alcohol are complete Ng down from the hills in quantities that seem unstoppable, targeted to the black neighborhood. Of course there are the officers on the take, those who look the other way, and those who actively support this crime spree. Mullen continues to do a good job mixing historical happenings with some mystery included, though to me these are more historical then anything else. The atmosphere is just so fitting to the times, as a city struggles with social change, how far to let it go. Blacks moving into boundaries that were considered all white. Rakestraw and his attempt to protect his sister by trying to uncover just how far the latest stupidity from his brother in law, has gone. Smith and Boggs will both become involved in issues that hit close to their hearts and home. Change is inevitable,though the wheels turn slowly. Smith and Boggs will both make hard decisions by books end, one surprising, at least to me. I actually enjoyed, if that is the right word, this second in series more than the first. It is a glimpse into a near past and to be honest many of the same things that were happening then are still happening now. Maybe in slightly different ways but social change is never easy nor quick, nor ever accepted by all.

Allowing myself to see things beyond good or bad, all or nothing, right or wrong, to view the plot in terms, black nor white, but in circumstance or necessity, made this a compelling read. Lightning Men draws lines, lines of race, line of boundaries, and lines of moral turpitude. Take a chance, venture across these lines.

The war was over and housing was scarce. Racial tensions were brewing, neighborhood lines were being redrawn, and not everyone was happy about that. Even the fact that black policemen now served in the Negro areas of Atlanta didn't mean these officers had the respect of white officers nor that of the residents. When a white man gets beaten down by the Klan and then a Negro beaten down a few days later, tensions threaten to erupt. What happens next? You'll have to read Lightning Men to find out!I was excited when I discovered there was a sequel to last year's Darktown. I was surprised at what I learned from that novel and I learned a lot from this one as well. For instance, I'd never of the Columbians before. Apparently, this group of neo-Nazis formed, (and so soon after the war in what must have felt like a direct insult to the soldiers and survivors now living in Atlanta), to unite their hatred of both Jews and Negroes. They even dressed similarly to the SS officers in Germany, hence their nickname: lightning men. I also learned a lot about how the neighborhoods changed during that less than peaceful time in American history. It's often painful to read about, but it's interesting to see events from several different points of view. Rake, Boggs, Smith and MacInnis are well rounded characters and even now, after a second novel, I think they all still have some secrets in reserve. None of them are perfect and they are all struggling to find their place in this new world, their new police station, (even if it is in the basement of the YMCA), and in their new neighborhoods. Social change doesn't come easy and I think all of these characters recognize and respect that in their behavior, which made them believable to me and maybe a little lovable too.Lightning Men is scary in a way, because it's easy to recognize some of the behaviors from this story on the nightly news today. It's also sad that so much good can begin to be undone by just a few hateful people in high places. Not only is this story a good one, but it reminded me that America always has to remain vigilant, so that everything we have worked so hard for as a people, is not undone by only a powerful few.

The Darktown series perfectly marries the research of historical information with the absorbing plotlines of a crime thriller. Lightning Men gives us a up close and personal look at racism dressed up as the white middle classes concern over a changing nation(sound familiar?). The circumstances faced by black people in 1950's can be hard to read at times, but just imagine living it. These black families only wanted to provide a better life for their kids by moving to better ( white) neighborhoods like I assume most families do.How are they rewarded for this? With beatings, firebombs, and lynching. Nightly visits from the KKK and their Neo Nazi friends. This folks is a time (1950's)when according to a poll 56% of Trump voters thought the country was last great.As I said before this series can be a tough read at times but its so worth it. I highly recommend Lightning Men.2018 Popsugar Reading Challenge: book by an author of a different ethnicity than me."}, {"userName": "Trish", "userReviewDate": "Sep 21, 2017", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/1826682-trish", "userReview": "Thomas Mullen\u2019s Darktown series, about the first black policemen in Atlanta\u2019s police force, is about race but it is also about the institution of policing. We are seeing how corruption and discrimination can take hold, and we ask ourselves what is the best way to combat the ever-widening spiral of deceit. We interrogate our own moral grounding and question whether we would be able to withstand the social and economic pressure put to bear to get us to go along on controversial arrests or worse. It is that evaluative distance and internal interrogation that Mullen creates in us that may be the most remarkable thing about his books. We are thinking critically and watching the narrative unfold from a protective distance even though his stories are gripping\u2014after all, this is life and death in neighborhoods just like ours\u2014and we really never know where he is going to steer us next. But these novels aren\u2019t really mysteries, and they aren\u2019t police procedurals in the typical sense. Do we need a new genre category for the historical and sociological recreation he manages?Mullen places us in the moment by citing newspaper headlines mentioning what is happening in the country and around the world in 1950:  \u201cLate morning the house is quiet with Cassie and the kids out at a park. Rake read the paper and enjoyed the solitude. An American minesweeper had become the first U.S. ship sunk in the Korean conflict; Joe McCarthy was insisting on a more thorough investigation into the Communist infiltration of the top echelons in the American government; and officials announced that the mysterious explosions in a Brooklyn neighborhood, initially feared to be a Red attack, had in fact been caused by a gas leak\u2026\u201dThese headlines do more than situate us in 1950, they also remind us that prejudice and crazy theories about racial or political superiority have been around before and have passed, though not without a fight. One of the very next scenes is a meeting between a cop seeking information on an old case and an FBI agent who\u2019d been involved at the time. The FBI man suggests they meet in a coffee shop to discuss the matter, and the moment Lucien Boggs, a black policeman, begins to walk into the coffee shop attached to a department store, we wonder\u2026Mullen doesn\u2019t let us down. He shows us the disdain and harsh attitude of the woman behind the counter, and the surprise and shutting down of the FBI agent who told Boggs to wait outside until he finished his coffee. Earlier, a white cop came across a flyer posted to a stop sign in a suburb of Atlanta: \u201cZoned as a White Community\u201d and emblazoned with a lightning bolt, \u201cjust like the ones sewn onto the sleeves of SS troopers he\u2019d seen in Europe.\u201d Mullen takes time to discuss the group he calls the Columbians, a group distinct from the KKK, indeed disdainful of it. This group supported Nazi ideas including the concept of a master race, and apparently believed America fought the Nazis in World War II only because the Japanese bombed Pearl Harbor, making \u2018sides\u2019 more clearly defined. Otherwise, America had been more concerned about the red menace from the Soviets.The rivalry between the Columbians and the KKK, who are derided by practically everyone for the bedsheets disguise, is central to this story and instructive in that it clarifies motives and actors in the messy phenomenon that is racism today. Mullen also spends some time answering the notion that blacks bring misfortune upon themselves. He opens the story with the release of Jeremiah Tanner from prison. Tanner had paid his debt, and readers are inclined to be sympathetic. Throughout the story, our impressions of Jeremiah will change several times, from believing him the most evil of all to believing him the most generous of all. This is Mullen\u2019s skill.The black lives in this latest novel are so much more difficult and complicated than we imagine at first. Their choices all appear to be bad ones. No surprise, then, that they find themselves in the middle of illegal or compromising situations again and again, and yet when we hear their explanations, they sound rational, making choices we might make in the same place. When you have bad choices, your decisions may look poor also.The white men\u2019s lives are less appealing altogether. There are a couple of white policemen wrestling with the morality of discrimination and the exclusion of black folk, but most make no effort to push back against the few bad apples that extract fealty or promise retribution within the force. They would revolt against the bad guys on the force, we sense, but they aren\u2019t impacted enough. They need stronger incentives to do right. They aren\u2019t heroes after all, just working men.Mullen also manages to pack in an excellent example and discussion of the lack of reasonable housing in Atlanta at the time for blacks who did not want to live in substandard apartments in dangerous neighborhoods. The real estate industry wouldn\u2019t certify black realtors so called them \u201crealtists,\u201d a word I found laughably close to \u201crealists.\u201d The phenomenon of \u201cwhite flight\u201d from neighborhoods into which black residents have moved is discussed in some detail.When Mullen\u2019s first book in this series, Darktown, came out last year, I asked him how he could write the black man's point of view. His answer shows his authorship of these characters:  \u201cAs far as the black point of view in the book, roughly half of the book is from black characters' perspective and about half is from white characters' perspective. But what's important here is that each character has his or her own, unique perspective--no character should be a mere stand-in for their race, or gender, or religion, or anything. I always want my characters to feel as 3-D and authentic and real as possible, in my other books and in DARKTOWN.\u201dBut are his characters authentic? Authentic enough for the series to be acquired prior to publication by Jamie Foxx for TV production. Let\u2019s just say the outline of the characters are there, and our imaginations (or actors) fill in the missing bits that make the piece real. So this is interactive fiction, in a sense. It needs our imagination, experience, and constant attention to understand what precisely is happening here, and to whom. This is an impressive series."}, {"userName": "Tucker", "userReviewDate": "Sep 24, 2017", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/39633342-tucker", "userReview": "\u201cLightning Men \u201c is an exceptional combination of a character driven police procedural with a very realistic and disturbing view of policing in the black community in the 1950\u2019s.

Again handcuffed by the limitations of their employers, the Atlanta Police Department (APD), Boggs and Smith, fearing corrupt white officers may be playing a more aggressive role than before in keeping their \u201coff-the-books\u201d investigation from gaining ground, cannot seem to touch the man they believe responsible. Boggs, recently engaged to Julie, a woman he met through the course of a prior investigation, discovers her ex-boyfriend and father to her child, Jeremiah, has returned from a stint in jail. With Boggs\u2019 father already disapproving of the engagement, how will Boggs juggle the responsibility of his job with the threat of a jealous ex-con waiting in the wings?I was wondering how Mullen would top the corrupt cops and corrosive racism in Darktown \u2013 I guess he just had to keep the asshole cops, throw in the KKK and add another Nazi sympathizing hate group, The Columbians, and you\u2019ve got a veritable bounty of bigotry for our heroes to contend with.Although they\u2019re few and far between, Mullen has a real knack for writing action scenes. They\u2019re used to great effect and only when characters are seemingly pushed to their breaking point making the scenes particularly explosive and violent. I can\u2019t remember the amount of times I was on the edge of my seat during a shootout or a fistfight/brawl.I didn\u2019t much care for the love triangle between Boggs, Julie and Jeremiah, but I understood its significance within the larger picture given where it ends up. There\u2019s nothing outright wrong with it, but many of the scenes lacked substance and felt like padding to an already rich plot. Boggs\u2019 partner, Smith, gains a lot of ground in proving to be an integral character moving forward and Rake is a world-class shit-disturber throwing wrenches in as many people\u2019s plans as possible.With Darktown, and now Lightning Men, Mullen offers stories of adversity in the hard-nosed world of mid-20th century America. While both books contain elements of the mystery and thriller genre, both are more about the struggle to achieve social change in an era of widespread fear and resistance sadly making it a somewhat timely read in 2017."}, {"userName": "Judy Collins", "userReviewDate": "Apr 18, 2017", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/11063006-judy-collins", "userReview": "The 30 Best Books of 20175 Stars +  From the acclaimed author, Thomas Mullen who introduced readers to the hit,  Darktown  landing on my  Top Books of 2016  \u2014racial integration of Atlanta\u2019s police department in 1948 \u2014 with an explosive multi-layered complex follow up: LIGHTNING MEN.  Racial violence and corruption continue in 1950\u2019s Atlanta, with African-American police officers, Boggs and Smith. As they say in the South, these two find themselves in a \"heap of trouble.\u201d  (Among others). \u201cHot Atlanta\u201d is not just sizzling.  It is blistering. Fiery. Tensions and emotions run high. Loyalties tested between family and law. Color lines threatened. Moral lines blurred. The second in the Darktown series,  Mullen uses his hard-boiled crime, cop procedural, to explore post-WWII racism in the South. The highly anticipated character-driven LIGHTNING MEN  is much more than just a crime-fictional thriller. Infused with critical historical details and timely controversial subjects we face today.\u201cAny candid observer of American racial history must acknowledge that racism is highly adaptable.\u201d \u2013 Michelle Alexander, The New Jim Crow Highly-charged,  Mullen turns up the intensity with characters facing moral, family, social issues and compromises. Tensions rise.  From racial prejudice, moonshining, drugs, greed, conspiracy, Klansmen, fascist Columbians, white supremacist, corruption, bigotry, violence, Jim Crow laws, preachers, shootouts, paybacks, fear, power, and segregated neighborhoods.In Darktown,  we met rookies: Officer Lucius Boggs and his partner, Tommy Smith. From different backgrounds,  their office was housed in the basement of the Negro YMCA, a makeshift precinct. They were not even allowed to arrest white men, nor allowed to drive a squad car. They could not patrol outside of the Negro neighborhoods that constituted their beat. No respect and little support. Only ten black officers  patrolled those thousands of souls. A third of Atlanta were black, yet crowded into only a fifth of the land. Boggs and Smith  had not taken bribes; however, with two years on the force, it appeared half of the white officers took bribes, so how long would the Negro officers resist?  Tired of their powerlessness.  The son of a preacher, Boggs was all too familiar with the fallibility of men, even men with power. Denny Rakestraw  (white) is distrusted by his fellow officers for his suspected role in the disappearance of his former partner, Lionel Dunlow. Rakestraw is not a racist but finds it difficult to fit in with his fellow white cops and work with the ten black cops. Neither side, fully trusts him.  Denny\u2019s problems increase  when his Klansman brother-in-law, Dale Simpkins, gets involved in a plot to stop the influx of African-Americans into his neighborhood, Hanford Park. Some cops are part of the Klan.  Will they accuse one of the wealthiest men in Atlanta of selling moonshine and marijuana?Boggs had come to respect McInnis  over the last two years. He had stuck up for his charges during a few disputes with white officers. How far can he go to protect them? Boggs (preacher\u2019s son) is dating Julie with a young son, Sage.  Soon to be married. His family opposes the relationship since she is not of their social status.  She has a secret past.  She is intimidated by their prestigious family. When a black man, Jeremiah  released from prison after five years, things get personal. Boggs life gets complicated when he learns the connection. Two years earlier, Boggs  came close to resigning his position and had second thoughts after a near-death experience. Now, he is unsure again.Too many mistakes that weighed heavily on his soul. He is sure there would be more guilt and an awkward relationship with his partner. Can he remain as a cop? Events will lead each character to major soul-searching. Smith had crossed another line as well. He was afraid.  . . . The Armor.  The fa\u00e7ade victims\u2019 families typically wore when they needed to protect themselves or the memory of their loved ones. Folks who wore The Armor sometimes had secrets to hide. The Armor was firmly in place as they parried the officer\u2019s attempts to learn more about the deceased. They wore The Armor to keep the cops from learning things. The secrets. The Armor is worn by the innocent, who had nothing to hide but their dignity, and they were so deeply offended to be questioned by these employees of the corrupt City of Atlanta, these paid enforcers of Jim Crow, that they refused to play along. They may be innocent, hurt, or protective. . . . \u201cAnd lines are only ideas people dream up, to govern what should be possible, to keep you from moving toward the forbidden.\u201d Three policemen struggle.  Each has an agenda and react in different ways to protect. Loyalties tested. Family versus law. Can they continue to work  with one hand tied behind their packs without the proper support to do their jobs? Will the latest emotional events, their actions, and tensions make them second guess their current careers? Will they continue to serve and make Atlanta a better city, or is it a useless effort? After violence and a shootout,  will Hanford Park be transformed? Will the lines between white and black be blurred after the postwar crowding, pushing blacks into areas formerly considered whites-only? From racial politics and struggles of history,  Mullen does not miss a beat! The complex emotions of each character are portrayed in depth, making the characters jump off the page. Others threaten lives. Others protect. Struggles both interior and exterior. Complications.  Affairs interrupted. Old scores settled. Blood feuds magnified. Pride. Costs were high. Greed. Hard-boiled. Explosive. Riveting. Timely!  Love this enthralling series  and looking forward to seeing what is in store next for Smith and Boggs. When reading of Boggs at his dad\u2019s house for dinner with Julie, reminds me strongly of Greenleaf (a favorite show) and their preacher/family dinners. Heaven forbid, their children do not follow their well-laid controlled plans. Movie-worthy!  For those who enjoy good crime fiction, and historical fiction as Mullen meticulously traces the civil rights movement through his well-written crime stories and cop procedurals, that involve \"real\" characters you come to care for. Fans of TV mini-series:  Underground, Greenleaf and Queen Sugar will enjoy this intense series as well as Michael Connley\u2019s Harry Bosch and Greg Iles' Penn Cage series.

Once again, Mullen brings his readers into the gritty streets of post-WWII Atlanta with its social and political issues, racial intolerance, corruption and outright brutality that continues to be the status quo for so many. Mullen doesn't shy away from these emotionally charged topics in this character-driven crime novel.Readers continue to witness the Black officers struggle within the confines set for them by their supervisors as the small Black force polices the Black neighbourhoods which are grossly overpopulated and in need of even basic necessities. This is in stark contrast to the White neighbourhoods -- and many Whites are fine with the way things are, thank you very much. The dichotomy between Black and White continues within this second book and I like that Mullen doesn't give easy answers or hold back on the gritty, hard-to-read scenes. Mullen also continues to educate readers about aspects that many may not know about, myself included. For me, that issue involved the Columbians (aka Lightning Men) who formed soon after the end of WWII. With their lightning patches on their uniforms they, like the Nazis that inspired them, reveled in promoting hate against Blacks and any diversity and were a smack in the face to those American soldiers who had just returned from battling similar hatred overseas. The cast, including Rake, Boggs, Smith and MacInnis, continue to show great depth and readers get some backstory on each but I still feel there's a lot of untapped issues that Mullen will bring forth with each character in future books. The only issue I had with this book is that I found there to be a lot of characters to keep track of.Mullen shows that, unfortunately, the process for social change is a very slow one as we sadly continue to witness in recent events. Racism, both blatant and covert, remains a timely issue and racial tensions ran high then as they do now. The Darktown series continues to be an eye-opening, gritty and gripping series with well-rounded, well-flawed characters who struggle within the stifling confines of racial injustice, ignorance, indifference and intolerance. Mullen has combined compelling characters weaves historical issues within his story with great skill. I highly recommend this book but I strongly suggest starting with Darktown."}, {"userName": "Tonstant Weader", "userReviewDate": "Jul 31, 2017", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/2050909-tonstant-weader", "userReview": "Lightning Men is the second in Thomas Mullen\u2019s Darktown historical mystery series imagining what it may have been like for Atlanta\u2019s first Black police officers. Lucius Boggs and Tommy Smith are partners policing Darktown, a difficult task when corrupt White police officers are partnering with drug traffickers. Hated by their fellow officers, many of whom are members of the Klan, they walk a very careful line to protect their community.Denny Rakestraw is a White officer who refuses to join the Klan. His neighborhood is \u201ctransitioning\u201d and the Klan, including his brother-in-law and a \u201cneighborhood association\u201d are both trying to stop it. His brother is a fool and gets himself entangled in a fine mess and Rakestraw risks far too much to save him.Housing is an arena where racism has been intractable. To this day, de facto housing segregation afflicts American cities. When Black people move into a neighborhood, White people move out. When White people move into Black neighborhoods, civic investment follows and suddenly Black people can no longer afford to live there. It is no surprise that housing segregation makes a powerful environment for violence and conflict.I enjoyed Lightning Men a lot. I cared about the characters. They are imperfect, flawed people with depth and authenticity. Sometimes their desire to do good is deflected by personal needs and conflicts of interest. They can be impatient and make mistakes which makes them far more interesting than those who always do right.Mullen succeeds in creating the time and place of post World War II Atlanta, the socio-political forces, the fears and aspirations of the people seem real. I have criticized authors for gratuitous use of racist epithets. Here is a book focusing on Jim Crow Atlanta, on Klansmen and a world of blatant, state-sanctioned white supremacy and of course, there are racist epithets, but when they are used, they are part of the story. There is a sense that Mullen interrogated himself before using epithets, asking himself if it is really necessary, not used to shock or show how transgressive he can be.This is my first book in this series. I will be reading Darktown, the first, as soon as I can get it from the library and I eagerly anticipate the development of this series as it moves forward.Lightning Men will be released September 12th.

It was a great book dealing with a delicate topic and I thought it was handled very well. When I learnt that there was a sequel coming soon, I immediately decided I wanted to read it. For those who haven\u2019t read Darktown, this can be perfectly read as a standalone. I didn\u2019t remember a lot of details, but it wasn\u2019t necessary. And I liked Lightning Men even better.This novel, like Darktown, tells the story of two young men who are amongst the first black cops in Atlanta, Georgia. The year is 1950 and things are definitely not easy for them. They can only patrol the \u201cblack\u201d neighbourhoods and barely have no power, as the white cops don\u2019t respect them and think they shouldn\u2019t be working with them at all. This makes it hard for Boggs and Smith to investigate the cases and this one was especially difficult to break.It\u2019s sad because I believe now things aren\u2019t much better. Of course we\u2019ve come a long way since then, but it\u2019s not enough. This is a very relevant book right now and it can make all of us reflect on the way our society behaves. Because not all racism is physically violent, but it\u2019s still there and this book perfectly portrays something that is still happening today. A fine example of this is Rakestraw\u2019s storyline, a young policeman whose German origins help him understand what it\u2019s like to feel different. In Lightning Men, Rake\u2019s wife and their neighbours are trying to raise money in order to buy the newest black residents out. What astounded me was that Rake\u2019s wife and the neighbours actually thought they were doing a good thing only because they weren\u2019t behaving violently (as opposed to the KKK case that Rake is investigating). These people merely wanted the neighbourhood to be completely \u201cwhite\u201d. As they said: \u201cThose poor families were tricked, they didn\u2019t know what they were doing, let\u2019s buy their houses to force them out\u201d. I. Can\u2019t. Even.The characters in Lightning Men are complex and multi-layered, especially Boggs and Rake. While I still think that Rake was too passive and could\u2019ve prevented plenty of things, I liked him better this time around. On the other hand, I thought Boggs needed to urgently drop his \u201cgolden kid\u201d act and grow up. I didn\u2019t like his air of moral superiority towards his girlfriend, Julie, whom I liked a lot, by the way. As for the negatives, the only thing I didn\u2019t like about this book was that I wasn\u2019t able to *love* any of the characters, I didn\u2019t feel I would miss them when I got to the end.Nevertheless, this is a fantastic novel that I\u2019d recommend to anyone who wants to read a good story that it\u2019s actually important and relevant in today\u2019s society. Don\u2019t miss it."}, {"userName": "Bill Lynas", "userReviewDate": "Mar 18, 2018", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/41874806-bill-lynas", "userReview": "Thomas Mullen's latest novel, set in 1950 Atlanta, follows on from his previous novel Darktown. However, you don't have to know Darktown to enjoy this excellent tale of Atlanta's first black police officers. This is not just a crime story; it is far more a drama played out with great characters, & every single chapter has something to keep the reader engrossed.There are so many good things that I can't begin to describe them. Mullen mixes fact & fiction & I found the story made me happy, angry, sad, amused & even upset. I still cannot for the life of me understand why anyone would dislike another person just based on the colour of their skin. What the fuck is wrong with people ? Yes, I know this is fiction but everything rings so true. Thankfully, almost 70 years after the book is set, society has moved on from these pathetic prejudices. I know we're not there yet, but hopefully one day we will be.I'm not really an emotional person, but Mullen's novel certainly gave my feelings a rollercoaster of a ride.

So, I was extremely excited to read its follow up, Lightning Men. This book took me forever to get through. It had nothing to do with the writing (it is phenomenal) or the plot (it is completely captivating). Instead, I found myself struggling due to the completely pertinent nature of the text. It made me completely sick to my stomach to think that a plot, highlighting racial in-equality and tension in the 1950s would be so relevant to 2017. I found this historical mystery to be completely draining. The second novel in this series picks up two years after Darktown with African American police officers, Officer Boggs and Officer Smith, in Atlanta on patrol. The characters remained just as realistic and well developed as in the first novel and Mullen\u2019s vivid imagery, which was one of the features I loved most within Darktown, was just as apparent throughout these pages. Mullens is a master of word choice and creating an entire \u201cscene\u201d for the reader. I do think the novel could be successfully read as a standalone, but I personally think they should be read as a series in their entirety. I think it makes the most sense for characterization. Like with Darktown, there were parts that I found hard to get through. Especially scenes depicting blatant racism- I found it especially hard to get through given the current events happening in our world (which I mentioned a little bit above); however, I do understand the importance of such raw displays. Overall, Mullens continues to create a raw and gritty tale within Lightning Men, a story that both disgusted and captivated me. Who knew that was even possible? If you okay with something a little heavier, but extremely well written, then I would absolutely read this series."}, {"userName": "Tom Mathews", "userReviewDate": "Sep 08, 2017", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/22063432-tom-mathews", "userReview": "Thomas Mullen\u2019s second foray into the world of Atlanta\u2019s first negro police officers is as good as the first. When I read Darktown, (see my review here). I was very impressed by the seriousness with which Mullen addressed the difficulties that these brave men faced. Lightning Men takes place a few years later, in the early 1950s, as the Korean War is getting under way. Moonshiners, their business damaged by the end of prohibition, have taken to supplementing their income with marijuana which has flooded into Darktown and black officers must contend not only with the gangs importing the drugs and alcohol, but with the crooked white cops who take kickbacks to look the other way. Lucius Boggs\u2019 life is further complicated when his fianc\u00e9e receives a visit from a former boyfriend.  The world is beginning to change but that change will not take place without a struggle. Black families, forced by overcrowding out of their traditional neighborhoods, are beginning to move into white neighborhoods. Their white neighbors, even those who aren\u2019t racist, foresee the likelihood that all they worked hard for will be destroyed by plummeting property values. Everyone from neighborhood associations to the Klan and pro-Nazi groups have ideas for how to resolve the issue. Not all of the ideas are peaceful. Bottom line: I was unaware that Mullen's was working on a sequel to Darktown so I was very pleased when I saw that Lightning Men was coming out. It was all I hoped it would be.

But, in the white neighbourhood of Hanford park, tensions have been inflamed by the purchase of homes by three black families, one of them Smith\u2019s sister and her husband. Although they have no jurisdiction, they find themselves more and more involved since it is clear that the white police will do nothing to protect the black families. This is also white officer Denny Rakestraw\u2019s neighbourhood. His refusal to join the Klan has not made him any friends on the force and, although he is willing to help Smith and Boggs a little, it is putting a strain on his relationship with his family and his good will towards the black families. Lightning Men by author Thomas Mullen is the sequel to Darktown and continues the story of Smith and Boggs as well as Rakestraw. Smith and Boggs must deal with racial tension, blockbusting, corruption, and drug smuggling while dealing with all the restrictions placed on their abilities to do their jobs. Among the dangers they must face are the Columbians, a Nazi group whose leader has just got out of prison and not coincidentally just before flyers appear in Hanford park:The flyer\u2019s capital letters made its message especially clear: \u2018Zoned as a White Community\u2019.

I like it very much for that because instead of one linear case, there are many things going on. Interestingly, while the Lightning Men are called out in the title (remnants of Nazism who think the Ku Klux Klan are too soft), the Lightning Men are sort-of the least part of the tale. I did get a little bit bogged down in the story about halfway through & ended up putting the book down for quite a few days before picking it up again. It's not easy to juggle the varied & overlapping stories & there are times it feels slightly clunky, writing-wise. Yet, it's still a riveting read overall.

The story unfolds in Atlanta, Georgia, pre-civil rights, Jim Crow Laws in effect. The Democrats are still bitter, and vengeful over slaves being freed. However, some progress has been made. A recent change had been made, and eight (8) black men were graduated onto the Atlanta Police Force. The new officers wear badges, carry guns . . . but their reach is very limited.The black officers are not allowed in the Atlanta precinct. Instead they rent a basement room at the YMCA. The new officers are not allowed to drive patrol cars. They have to walk their beat. They are not allowed to arrest white people. The new officers are only allowed to patrol black neighborhoods, otherwise known as Darktown. Only, in LIGHTNING MEN, black people have begun moving into white neighborhoods.White Officer Denny Rakestraw, and black officers Lucius Boggs, and Tommy Smith are once again the thick of things. The klan attack a white man in a nearby county. The attempted murder seems unfounded, and unprovoked. The Klan is hot about the uncommissioned deed, and looking for answers. Boggs is about to get married to Julie, despite family protests. However when her past comes waltzing into town, things once thought buried are unearthed and Boggs is nothing if not at the very least preoccupied with how to move forward. Smith's family is in a pickle. The idea of law, right and wrong, are now grey boundaries. Black and white has become obscured! Officer Rakestraw is not without issues at home impacting his judgment. Once again, family. He resides in one of the areas where black families are moving in. While he is not racist, his wife is. And she wants to sell the house before the property value bottoms-out.LIGHTNING MEN is filled with backroom deals, and realty scams. The KKK is a driving force, but not the only evil in town. Dealers of moonshine and weed are at ends, fighting over territories. Darktown is a prime location for sales and everyone wants a piece of that pie! Bad cops taking bribes, good cops looking the other way . . . LIGHTNING MEN is nothing but constant tension. It leaves a knot in your gut the entire time you are reading, and fills you with anger even after you've finished the book. (I highly, highly recommend reading DARKTOWN first, but LIGHTNING MEN stands fine on its own. It is a complete tale. You just might get more from it having started the saga from the beginning).Thomas Mullen is an impressive writer. Although these are the only two books I have read by him, I will be adding his other titles to my ever-growing library. This is a crime writer worth keeping an eye on.

This historical fiction crime novel is set during the racial tensions of the 1950's South. In an overcrowded and rapidly changing Atlanta, the segregated city is patrolled by a segregated police force. It is two years since Officer Denny Rakestraw and \"Negro Officers\" Lucius Boggs and Tommy Smith were first introduced inLightning Men. The three officers are trying to keep the peace amidst volatile situations.Officer Denny (Rake) Rakestraw finds himself embroiled in the midst of racial tension as black families begin to move into a formerly white neighborhood, Hanford Park. This attracts the attention of the Klan and Nazi brown shirts, putting Rake in the position of following the law or showing loyalty to his family, who are Klan members. Boggs and Smith are trying to work within the system to stop the sale of moonshine and drugs in Darktown, their area of the city, but their investigation implicates powerful men, including members of the police force. They too, are faced with the dilemma of trying to enforce the law while protecting their families while street fights and gun violence increase.In Lightning Men Mullen blends a crime novel with historical fiction. There are indications that Darktown and Lightning Men are the first books in a continuing series. I do regret not reading Darktown before Lightning Men, although you can certainly read Lightning Men and follow the plot. I think that reading the first book in the series, though, would provide me with even better developed characters and a more extensive background into their lives. If you have a copy of Lightning Men, though, don't let this comment stop you from reading it. The characters are still very well developed and are complicated, flawed individuals.Superb writing helps keep the intricate and complex plot moving along swiftly, while including plenty of period details, attitudes, and actions that show a realistic historical setting. Although this is a historically accurate novel, it isn't, however, always an easy book to read. Mullens accurately depicts segregation and racism, which can feel brutal and raw as you are reading.Disclosure: My review copy was courtesy of Atria.http://www.shetreadssoftly.com/2017/0..."}, {"userName": "Skip", "userReviewDate": "Jan 18, 2018", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/1389748-skip", "userReview": "Like its predecessor Darktown, this book is a very good period piece, capturing raw racial relations in Atlanta in the 1950's.

As with \u201cDarktown\u201d, this is both a mystery and historical fiction novel set in 1950\u2019s Atlanta when the Ku Klux Klan was rampant and discrimination was assumed.Main characters Lucius Boggs, Tommy Smith, Sergeant McInnis, and Denny Rakestraw are back. Boggs and Smith are African-American police officers working the beat of Darktown, the segregated part of Atlanta for Blacks. Their Sergeant, McInnis is white and fights the injustice of internal Atlanta police who degrade the Black Officers. In this story, Boggs, Smith, and McInnis are trying to stop the sale and distribution of illegal drugs and liquor which is supported by the white police force. Author Mullen loves to show the swarthy and dirty side of police corruption in the 1950\u2019s. Mullen also included the changing racial demographic lines at the time. Educated and prosperous Blacks were moving into white neighborhoods and the Klan was not happy. White Officer Denny Rakestraw happens to live in a neighborhood that is experiencing racial change. Rakestraw is not a racist, but walks a fine line between keeping his job and helping the Black police force. Through Rakestraw, the reader feels the conflicting feelings and the stress of fighting against his fellow racist police colleagues, his neighbors, and his own family. Through McInnis the reader feels the demoralizing front of his fellow officers. Lucius Boggs hails from an educated family. Through Lucius the reader learns how racist white people despise educated and articulate black folk. Tommy Smith is a street-smart man who understands the culture of the seedy subculture of Darktown. Both Boggs and Smith work under impossible situations. The reader endears along with them as they struggle to enforce the law and clean up their part of town. My only complaint with this novel is that Mullen didn\u2019t provide info in his Author\u2019s notes. He did a fabulous job with his previous novel. In this one, he cited one novel. I do love references in author\u2019s notes. Sometimes the notes make the novel even more fantastic.

The housing issues are well presented and will remind people of the time of redlining and white flight here in Chicago as well as in many communities across America. In addition, black police officers, by trying to clean their neighborhoods of drugs and moonshine, are interfering with rackets which benefit white police officers. This book and its predecessor are not easy reads, but I highly recommend them because they so clearly share the history of that time when the US was beginning to be torn apart again by its original sin of slavery.

Officer Boggs and Officer Smith are back and it is one hell of a great read!Atlanta, Georgia 1950 sets the scene of the novel. The growing racial tensions and the civil rights movement, create a powerful backdrop for this novel. Officer Boggs and Officer Smith are two of Americas first black police officers. They don\u2019t have the same rights as the white officers and they certainly don\u2019t hold any form of privilege. But what they do have, is the desire and power to clean up their own community!

Meanwhile, Boggs is dealing with a personal drama, with his new choice of fianc\u00e9e. Smith is looking forward to the birth of his new niece/nephew but wary as his sister has chosen to move into the white area of town. One City, two races and three cops! The prologue opens with Jeremiah being released from Georgia state prison. With no more than 75 cents in his pocket and no one to collect him. We the reader become aware he is alone in the world! His girlfriend having stopped writing years ago and he is startled by police sirens nearby. He stumbles across a preacher who warns him that if he doesn\u2019t find a place to stay, he can be re-arrested for vagrancy! The preacher warns he has seen many paroled convicts, re-jailed in shocking time! \u201cAlways know what you\u2019re up against and what you\u2019re dealing with, and how you\u2019ll get out of it if it turns ugly\u201d Sgt McInnes Boggs and Smith police their territory of Atlanta. Taking out moonshiners and drug dealers. They are determined to clean up the streets and refuse to be bought. Which unfortunately is not the same for the white police officers, who are happy to wade into dark town and take their cut of the drug money. In 1950 Atlanta, black people made up 1/3 of the population but they were crowded into 1/5 of the land. Poverty and inadequate housing at every turn. When you can\u2019t get a job of fair salary, crime pays. Just 10 black police officers to patrol thousands of souls\u2026\u2026Life for the black officers is far from easy. They aren\u2019t allowed to wear their uniforms to/from work for fear of being killed. They face prejudice at every turn. They are often racially abused by the white police officers. They are not allowed to interact with white civilians and if suspect a white person of a crime, must find the nearest call box, for the white officers. They are not allowed to drink, even when off duty. Whilst the white officers frequently take the law into their own hands. Many are rumoured to be members of the Klan. The inequality and injustice is fully explored, the white privilege of the 1950s is unveiled. Boggs and Smith, along with Officers Dewey Edmunds and Champ Jennings continue to police the neighbourhood with conviction, despite the unfair world that surrounds them. When they stumble across a crime in progress and take action. It leaves a dead body, that none of them shot! With Boggs having knocked out a white suspect, safe to say, the officers have opened a can of worms! What ensues in their conversations offers an insight how they each individually view race? \u201cYou think white ladies don\u2019t drink?

The world of their organisation makes for in-depth writing. The author has clearly researched the Klan and how they operate. Dale having been initiated at just 16yrs old, firmly believes, this is the gang for him. But a man so uneducated and angry, is an easy individual to manipulate.

His preacher father is disgusted at the impending nuptials and warns his son, so marry a \u2018nice\u2019 girl. The fact that Julie is a single mother to a young son Sage, has the preacher in the belief she is a fallen woman. This only serves to push Boggs closer to Julie. But Julie holds some secrets of her own, secrets only she and one other soul know\u2026\u2026\u2026There is an introduction of a character called Bartholomew Kressler. Which makes for interesting reading, I am not going to spoil the character for readers. But he is exceptionally unusual, put it that way! He informs Boggs and Smith that he witnessed local loan shark and all round thug Thunder Malley at the scene of a crime. When Dale urgently calls rake in the middle of the night, in trouble. Having escaped from a crime scene that left one man dead and one man badly beaten. It forces Rake to investigate, to try to keep Dale from being arrested. His motives for this are sketchy, but are fully explored throughout the novel. He uncovers the dead man was a suspect in the beating. A dead Klansman named Walter Irons. The victim of the beating however, is a white banker named Martin Letcher. Letcher not being unknown to the Klan himself, he believes in their values. Why are the Klan attacking their own men? How involved is Letcher? What are the motives for the beating? Boggs and Smith continue to seek to take out Thunder Malley. They want Malley out of their community and not flushing it with his illicit product. We learn Smith has informants in the community and manages to navigate the criminal underworld in a different way to Boggs. The informant warns them there is a turf war about to erupt. That Quentin \u2018Q\u2019 Neale is wading on Malleys territory. He warns them Q has protection from the white cops. Something Boggs and Smith, do not! The novels progresses at an engrossing pace. We learn more about the background of Rake. Invited to join the Klan in 1948, post his service in ww2. Rake refused. We learn of his immigration status, that his mother and father were progressive on race. They themselves being treated appallingly as German refugees in America, due to the war. His previous partners have been members of the Klan and this has always led to heated debate. Rakes father summarises the Klan \u201cragtag group of bullies and Neanderthals\u201d. We also learn more about Smith\u2019s background. His father was lynched in 1919, after \u2018daring\u2019 to wear his uniform from his service in the great war. His mother couldn\u2019t cope with the grief and committed suicide. Leaving him an orphan as a child. He was taken in by an aunt and raised as her child, along his sister Hannah. Hannah is now heavily pregnant with her first baby. Her husband Malcolm is a veteran of ww2 and served in the 761st tank battalion, the famed black panthers. Malcolm has struggled to find work, after being demobbed and is currently working as a bouncer at a local club. Having recently moved into a white neighbourhood, they are facing daily threats and intimidation to move out. When a break, with a note attached comes flying through the window they call on Smith to help!Cassies Rakeshaw, Rake\u2019s wife is of different political thinking than her husband. She fears the local black population and what will become of \u2018her\u2019 neighbourhood. When local neighbours Paul and Martha Anne Thames invite her to join their group Collective Association of Hanford Park (CAHP). Their goal being to buy out the black homeowners. What will Rake make of her choices? Why is she so consumed with fear? Will she pay for the choices she makes?There were moments throughout the book that I just had to put it down and digest the information. Why does a hateful mentality spread like a poison in communities?When Malcolm is attacked, Smith is summoned to Grady Hospital, the coloured wing. Malcolm has been beaten so badly, he is lucky to be alive. He can\u2019t account for who beat him, but it is known there was more than one assailant and they used a bat. Malcolm is angry and demands justice. He wants to see the white suspects held account for the beating. He quickly learns that this will not be happening anytime soon, when the cops cover it up for fear of a riot. \u201cBlame the negro for causing trouble, Boggs thought Disturbing the peace\u201dRake doesn\u2019t despise the black officers and upon seeing \u2018white community only\u2019 flags in his neighbourhood, tears them down. The flags carry a logo and it becomes clear to Rake the Columbians are back in town. Who are the Columbians? What is their connection to the Klan? Is this a turf war also? Jeremiah returns to the town he knows. He discovers most of his friend are dead or in jail. His family have left for Chicago and blame him for the death of his brother. He only has one person he can call on in the world. Unbeknown to him, this woman has a new life. One she is not willing to give up on\u2026\u2026.The Columbian/Klan theme is further detailed. I found it profound that it is more often than not (2017 and 1950s) those who have never fought for their country, whom believe right wing ideals and aspire to violence, fear and war to achieve their goals. Having seen recent media reports of a Nazi march in the USA. I did ponder why these men armed to the teeth with rifles, had not enlisted after 9/11. Thunder Malley is finally apprehended and taken into police custody. However, police custody as a black man in 1950, is no safe place to be. It isn\u2019t long until his body is discovered dead and it stinks of police corruption. All this takes place as Dale is due to meet the grand wizard himself. Overseer of the entire Georgia KKK at their sacred altar. Dale learns that the incident he took part in, was unsanctioned by the grand wizard. Which means dale could pay with his life for the crimes he took part in. Now Dale fears the KKK, imagine the irony in that\u2026\u2026\u2026..As the novel continues we see Hannah receive further rape/death threats. Rake become involved with the Georgia Bureau of Investigations (GBI). A local business owner is also dragged into the case. The white ladies down at the records department continue to ignore Boggs or Smith\u2019s attempts to access files. Which again I figured was ironic given their own status of oppression as 1950s women. The case continues to throw up new characters, such as known racist Sgt Slater. The past comes back to haunt all the characters and to read it all unfold is gripping. One thing is for certain it is all going to erupt. \u201cWhich part you find harder, the white cops who hate you for thinking you\u2019re as good as them, or the coloured folk who hate you for \u2018acting white\u2019?\u201d.There are moments of reading this novel that I actually flinched, the spiteful terms or insults were painful to read. But they are accurately portrayed, this is how segregation worked. The knowledge that racist terms were incorporated into everyday language. Such as the use of the term \u2018boy\u2019 to a black adult male was done do, to show inferiority. So many phrases and slogans coined, to make the already privileged white person feel even more smug and superior! Boggs and Smith make for perfect reading and their bond is firmly cemented in this case. This has to be my longest ever review and I shall finish up with saying, 3 simple words. Five star genius! 5* Genius!"}], "description": "From the acclaimed author of The Last Town on Earth comes the gripping follow-up to Darktown, a \u201ccombustible procedural that will knock the wind out of you\u201d (The New York Times).Officer Denny Rakestraw, \u201cNegro Officers\u201d Lucius Boggs and Tommy Smith, and Sergeant McInnis have their hands full in an overcrowded and rapidly changing Atlanta.
