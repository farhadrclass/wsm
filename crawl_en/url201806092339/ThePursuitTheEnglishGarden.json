It was nice getting a break from a female perspective intent on the love and marriage aspect. I enjoyed the \"change of scenery\" with it following Edward on his travels back home. The ship, new and unusual characters, along with the mystery of Osborne and Denley made this a much more intriguing story to me and I felt it wrapped up the series nicely. All of the characters were well written. I thoroughly enjoyed the adventures with Edward, \"Osborne\", and Denley."}, {"userName": "Danielle", "userReviewDate": "Mar 03, 2017", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/58918837-danielle", "userReview": "1. Author\u2019s Backgroundthe author that wrote this book is Lori Wick. She was born on November 10th,1958. Lori Wick is the age 58 She has written more than 100 books and 39 novels of heart-warming romance. She writes really good books.2. Literary Time PeriodThis book was about the 1800. where they had no wifi or nothing electronic. They had lanterns for the light and in the lanterns they had candles. They had to go on a ship instead of a plane to get somewhere far. So its basicly nothing like today.3. SettingThe setting was in different places. The book goes all over to other characters and what's happening to them. At first it talks about this guy at a house with two kids and he's getting on a ship to go to lunden. Then it talks about this lady who people think is a man on the ship, then she is in lunden and in the woods. both of the main characters have been all over the world it sounds like.4. CharactersThere is a guy named Edward. Mr. Osborne who is really a young lady named Nikki. Then it talks about her friends and her twin sons who are only five. When it talks about Edward it talks about his brothers and his sister and her little family.5. ThemeThe theme at first is fun but then after some stuff happens it goes to happy. The reason why it goes happy is because they get to see their friends and family. Then it starts getting romantic when they meet each other again and they just start hanging out. I don't want to say to much because it's a really good book.6. Plot SummaryEdward Steel has enjoyed a great adventure in Africa with his brother, Henry. But has returned to England and Edward hoping to be home for Christmas, is ready to follow him. However, Edward has always been a man of his word. When aboard the ship he tells two stranger he will help them. He stands by that promise- never dreaming that meeting these two men will a women into his life who captivates and confounds him in equal measure.After rendering assistance to the gentlemen, which costs him valuable time, Edward continues on his way. Believing he will never see his fellow travelers again. He cannot foresee that when spring comes to Collingbourne, his life will never be the same again.7. Literary DevicesI think the garden would be one because its a place where the couple goes and calms down to talk. They don't like being really mad at each other so they go there and talk things out.The bible is another thing that would be a symbol. She has to trust in the bible and the person they call God. She thinks that he will save her and her twins.8. Memorable QuotesEdward- any verse of the bible is a quote from him.Nikki- \"I have to make sure she doesn't take my kids again\". this shows that she really cares and loves her kids and doesn't want anything to happen to them again.."}, {"userName": "Diana", "userReviewDate": "Jun 06, 2017", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/4488487-diana", "userReview": "This series is great for romantic escapist novels. Most of the characters are nauseatingly morally good people and the situations are fantastical but still the writing is fast paced enough to make the stories interesting. I mostly skip the detailed descriptions of tea parties and other such occasions to get to the story which makes it a fast and romantic read.This book was very much inferior to the first 2 books and the mystery was a bit out there. I wasn't impressed with the slow pacing. However I was still interested enough to want to find out what happened and I liked the ending so that is why it got 3 stars instead of 2."}, {"userName": "Donna Bagby", "userReviewDate": "May 05, 2017", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/50562867-donna-bagby", "userReview": "The Pursuit Book 4 Ed Steele; Mr. Osbourne; Denley: Nicola (Niki) has been running from a frightening past disguised as a man to protect her two boys.

I recommend this series wholeheartedly!Out of the four, this one had the most action and the least amount of romance. I sincerely wish that Lori Wick would've written a book for Henry! I would devour it immediately! Tate and Cassandra had me literally laughing out loud, which is something I've done in all other three books too. This series has brought me so much joy and has been such an encouragement, I'm just sad to have to end it. Although I was happy there was an epilogue, I found myself very distressed that it took place ten years later! It was hard to meet back up with them after so many life changes and it was, indeed, hard to say goodbye!"}, {"userName": "Rachael", "userReviewDate": "Jan 12, 2016", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/17151175-rachael", "userReview": "Edward is returning from Africa.

The biggest reason? There was actually a bad guy and a mystery. The other three were \"just\" love stories where you go through the courtship of a couple you knew were going to end up married. This time when Edward met Niki you knew that something serious was going on but didn't know what. Then when you did find out what was going on you had to see how it was all going to play out. There was more to the story than wondering how long it was going to take before they realized they were in love. :)"}, {"userName": "Judine", "userReviewDate": "Jul 16, 2008", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/1329403-judine", "userReview": "To be honest, I loved this book until the Epilogue, which just tried to wrap up too much. Edward and Niki's romance was beautiful and I'm delighted she took the trouble to show a widow with children doubting her ability to remarry. However, jumping ahead 12 years in the epilogue left me feeling unsatisfied with the ending. I also thought the newly married Steele sisters' storylines could have been wrapped up better than they were in the epilogue - a year later would have been much more appropriate, and answered all my questions of what happened in the book."}, {"userName": "Deana", "userReviewDate": "Oct 06, 2008", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/1394784-deana", "userReview": "I was desperate for a good relaxing read and the library was closing so I just looked for what looked like a good book near where I was standing! This cover was pretty and I read the back cover and it sounded like it could be good. It begins with mystery and adventure and ends with lots of romance. It was a perfect book for what I wanted. It is also a little religious. Overall I loved it. The main character is dealing with a big problem and when she finally shares her burden it becomes bearable! A great lesson for all of us."}, {"userName": "L8blmr", "userReviewDate": "Aug 07, 2012", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/883477-l8blmr", "userReview": "This was a gift and my first book by this author. I did not know it was part of a series until I was already into it. There was a lot of jumping around from one couple to another, which readers of the whole series probably enjoyed, but it was distracting to me.
