I think that is what I found so enjoyable about this book, there was just so much love... Love for family... love for their orchard... love for food... and there was even some romance in this book... and I have to say Angelo was pretty delicious as well...Something I want to mention that I found terribly interesting... is that this book was written by a man.... using the pen name of Viola Shipman...

I was thrilled to read an early copy of the author\u2019s latest book. Viola Shipman is actually a pen name for a male author who chose to write under his beloved grandmother\u2019s name as a tribute to her. You can feel the author\u2019s devotion to his grandmother, and his entire family, in these words, even though this is fiction and not intended to be any type of memoir as far as I know. Another lovely aspect of this book was the coastal Michigan setting. How quaint, cozy, and gorgeous. At the heart of this story is Sam, an aspiring fancy NYC sous chef, who has to move back home to Michigan as a \u201cfailure.\u201d Her family owns an orchard and pie shop. Sam has some scars, and it\u2019s through cooking alongside the women in her family that she begins to heal. I loved that each chapter featured a recipe from the family\u2019s recipe box. Overall, a pleasurable read about women healing each other through their love of food. And because I can\u2019t resist the pun, it\u2019s the perfect \u201cpalate cleanser\u201d between heavier reads.

Is that what Sam really wanted?Probably not, but it made her mother and grandmother happy so Sam accepted it and made her first pie.THE RECIPE BOX was a gift no thirteen-year-old wanted, but it was a gift that kept on giving throughout Sam's life.We follow Sam as she leaves her loving Michigan home and goes to New York to attend culinary school. She was a hit in New York, but her boss was a fake. To her family\u2019s delight Sam decided to come back home.Sam comes back to the love and warmth of her family and their bakery and orchards. Was she really ready for this? Did she make the right decision by coming back home?All of the characters were lovable, but Grandma Willo was my favorite as was the story from her youth and her life. Grandma was simply someone you would love to have as your grandmother because of her positive attitude and attention to making sure her family was happy in everything they chose.THE RECIPE BOX is a \u201csweet,\u201d loving read that makes you want to go into the kitchen and be with grandma making the pies and other delicious desserts.Each chapter was titled with a recipe and inside each chapter we get to join in the family fun and view the ingredients and directions for the yummy food the family makes.THE RECIPE BOX is for anyone who loves to bake with family, who loves recipes, who loves family history, and who enjoys being in a beautiful setting.You most likely will shed a few tears not because of sadness, but because of the warmth and love that oozes from the characters and from things they say. THE RECIPE BOX is a book that is an uplifting, make-sure-you-make-the-right decisions in your life by following your instincts and embracing change.

Last year, I had the opportunity to read this author\u2019s second novel \nThe Hope Chest\n and while it was an enjoyable read for me, it didn\u2019t capture my heart like this third book \nThe Recipe Box\n did. At the heart of this book was a wonderful story about family, love, relationships, identity, and one of my favorite topics : FOOD -- not just any food though \u2013 pies, cakes, tarts, cookies, and all manner of delicious baked goods! The story centers around Sam, a young sous-chef for a fancy bakery in New York who ends up quitting her job and returns home to Michigan, where her family owns an orchard and pie shop. Having grown up on the orchard surrounded by a loving family as well as the two women who inspired her love of baking \u2013 her mother Deana and her grandmother Willo \u2013 Sam returns to her childhood home to \u201click her wounds,\u201d sort out the mess she made of her life, and hopefully gain some clarity on the next steps for her future. Sam is welcomed back with open arms and quickly falls back in step with working at the orchard alongside the women in her life who had always meant so much to her \u2013 together, as they work through the recipes in the family\u2019s recipe box, Sam not only develops a deeper understanding of her family\u2019s treasured history and legacy, she also embarks on a journey of self-discovery that reignites her passion for baking as well as opens her heart to love.I enjoyed this gem of a story that was filled with characters I adored from the start! I love stories about strong, smart, independent-minded women and this story had plenty of them \u2013 from Sam to Deana to Willo, also the generations that came before them with Madge and Alice, even though not mentioned as much but yet still so important to the story, I loved all these women! With well-written and descriptive prose, the story was incredibly atmospheric, to the point that I felt as though I was transported to the Mullins family orchard right from the very first page. In fact, I would say that the setting of the orchard (and pie pantry) became actual \u201ccharacters\u201d for me, coming vividly alive as the story unfolded and we learned more and more about Sam and her family with each chapter. I felt that the story itself was lovely and heartwarming, though yes it was a bit predictable and perhaps a little too saccharine and sweet, but that\u2019s fine because it was the perfect escape for me after a series of heavier reads and also me dealing with a few rough patches in my own life. From the moment I started reading, I was expecting a light-hearted, feel good story with a plot that wasn\u2019t too complicated and also characters I could possibly relate to \u2013 I ended up getting that and much, much more! Included at the end of each chapter was the recipe \u2013 ingredients and step-by-step instructions \u2013 for making each of the desserts featured in the story, which was a lovely surprise and an aspect of this book that I loved! In addition, I also enjoyed reading about the origin of each recipe as well as explanation of the real-life significance behind each dessert in the author\u2019s note at the end of the book. Even though I most likely won\u2019t attempt to make these desserts myself due to the fact that I\u2019m a lousy cook and an even worse baker, I am also blessed to have wonderful women in my family who are fantastic when it comes to turning food into delectable creations so I know for sure they will enjoy trying these recipes out!I recently found out that Viola Shipman is actually the pen name for Wade Rouse, a male author who writes under his grandmother\u2019s name to honor her. Just like with his two previous novels \nThe Charm Bracelet\n and \nThe Hope Chest\n, this book \nThe Recipe Box\n was also inspired by one of his grandmother\u2019s heirlooms that was passed down to him. As he writes in his author\u2019s note, this book \u201cis a tribute to our elders, especially the women in our lives whose voices were often overlooked in their lifetimes.\u201d What a wonderful way to honor his grandmother and also remind us as readers to treasure the elders in our lives and continue to pass along their love, lessons, family stories, and heirlooms to those we love as well! Wonderful book and definitely a highly recommended read!Received ARC from St. Martin\u2019s Press via NetGalley."}, {"userName": "Judy", "userReviewDate": "Feb 18, 2018", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/5778052-judy", "userReview": "Sweet as pie!

She went to NY, to go to culinary school and got a job at a famous bakery that was often filmed for Good Morning America.

If you weren't hungry when you started the book, you will be as soon as you start reading these recipes. The family constantly bakes for each other and the deserts that they make are so well written that you can almost taste the apple turnovers and apple crisp. One other thing that I really enjoyed is that this book is a love letter to my native state of Michigan.

This book contains just about everything sweet and good that a book should have. It has a family...a Michigan family of bakers who own an apple orchard. The book shares stories from all of this family\u2019s generations of bakers but focuses on Sam...she is the latest generation. She is a professionally trained chef working in NYC but...she comes home to Michigan and her family because she is at a unique point in her life. Sam needs to find out what she really wants to do with her life...is her happiness in NYC or is it in the big kitchens of her grandmother\u2019s apple orchards. Only Sam can figure out her destiny. Why I wanted to read it...The cover of this book is deliciously enticing as are the many recipes it contains. The book details the strength of the women who have maintained and grown this orchard over the years. The book also details what life is like in Michigan near the largest lake ever. What made me truly enjoy this book...Viola Shipman used the most beautiful descriptive language when she described summers near Lake Michigan. Blues and greens and emeralds and incredibly lovely waters. Every time Sam or her dad took a bite of a crisp apple that fell from a tree right into their hands...I wanted one, too! And I can\u2019t forget to mention the recipe boxes and their keys...the recipe cards dotted with butter and berry stains yet treasured over time. But that\u2019s something the reader will savor while reading this book.Why you should read it, too...Readers who enjoy lovely family stories that have just a bit of angst...and tons of recipes containing apples and cherries...should enjoy this book.

Her mother Deana and Grandma Willow become her biggest supporters.As she engulfs a new life with new found hope she connects with a past that was nearly lost in a recipe box that holds so much more than mere recipes.What matters most is a common theme here and how to put forth that effort to reap the greatest reward for all not just self.In the end , we must all seek our own individual happiness and in today's world we base that on inconsequential things or material possessions.

It is early in the morning, but New York City is awake and buzzing. Why does she feel this knot of dread in her stomach every day when she arrives at what is supposedly her dream job? Today is different. The cute little bakery is dark and quiet. A note from the head pastry chef alerting their ridiculous boss that she is quitting is the way Sam starts her day. Things go from bad to worse when Chef Dimples acts like the pompous fake he is, leaving Sam no choice but to quit. Tail between her legs, Sam slinks home to her family\u2019s orchard and pie shop. While Sam is home, she reconnects with her family, her roots and her heritage all courtesy of her family recipe box. Each recipe is a tried and true and each one has a story. Will Sam find her way?What I Liked:*The Recipe Box is a charming, sweet treat that I absolutely adored. I was enchanted by the recipe box and the familial stories that were tied into each of the recipes. This is a story about life, love, family and baking. The best part is that the book is packed with mouth watering, scrumptious recipes.*I loved that this novel was all about family and roots. The book is filled with small stories about the women in Sam\u2019s family, from her great great grandmother, Alice, her great grandmother, Madge, her beloved grandmother, Willo, and her own mother. Each woman was instrumental in making sure the family orchard survived for the next generation, and each woman added her own recipes and stories to the treasured recipe box. It was a joy to uncover each recipe and to learn the story behind each recipe card in the box. *This story is a loose collection of familial stories woven around the main story arc that follows Sam as she battles with her personal choices. Will she continue to seek out the world and reach for big city dreams, or will she find love and return to her roots? I think everyone goes through a point in their life when they struggle to find their place and their path. I enjoyed following Sam\u2019s journey.*I loved the strong female characters in this book. Each of the women in the book somehow found a way to save the family orchard during hard times such as the depression and war time, bad weather, illness and death, and the ever changing economy of agriculture. The women made the orchard run, and they did it with luck, love and sheer determination as well as a few sweet treats and recipe boxes.*I was enchanted by the concept of the recipe box. The women believed that baking was an act of love, and they treasured the recipes passed down from woman to woman in the family. I recall watching my own grandmothers bake as a girl, and I am sad that many of my paternal grandmother\u2019s recipes are lost as she mainly cooked and baked from memory. What a treasure it would be to have a recipe box loaded with recipes from my female ancestors. *One of the best parts of this book for me was the delicious recipes. There were some yummy recipes in this book, and I am more than anxious to try them. I loved that at the end of the book, the author shared the true story behind each and every recipe. Make sure you read the author\u2019s notes. *The ending is nostalgic and wonderful. It was perfect. And The Not So Much:*I loved the women in this book, but I have to admit, I struggled with Sam, the main character. She is constantly pushing away people in her life, especially those who care the most about her, whether it be her family, a man who adores her or her childhood boyfriend. I wish she had been warmer and more endearing. *I was drawn in by so many of the stories about the women who came before, and there were numerous times after a story completed, that I was left wanting more. I especially wanted more of Grandma Willo\u2019s stories. I couldn\u2019t get enough. *The romance was a bit of a miss for me, and I think because it lacked spark because one of the participants is closed off and unwilling to open up and take a chance. The other put themselves out there over and over only to be shut down. That drove me nuts!The Recipe Box was the perfect pick me up, feel good read that I have been craving. This book has so much heart and soul. It is all about family, roots, heart, home and recipes. If you want a book with scrumptious recipes and a wonderful story, this is one to grab. This will be a favorite on my shelf. I received a copy of this book from the publisher in exchange for an honest review. All opinions are my own, and I was not compensated for this review.

I love how the story painted itself into living and breathing characters right in my mind - the scenes of NYC and Michigan were both breathtaking and unforgettable. I would love to go to the pie pantry, pick apples, eat apples, and chat and have fun with family and friends. Willo was probably my favorite character, and I also loved how the story flashed back to previous Mullins women - I enjoyed both the prologue and the epilogue, I thought they were written beautifully. You don't need to look further than this book if you want a novel full of heart, wisdom, and inspiration... and food! Yum... all those desserts sounded delicious. I love how Sam baked things using family recipes, how they meant something to her and how she learned to follow her heart. Don't read this book on an empty stomach!

Books set in small towns always appeal to me. However, no matter how hard I tried, I just couldn't get into this. I couldn't bring myself to care about the characters. What Went Wrong: 1) The main character - On the surface, there's nothing terrible about Sam. She's kind and sweet. She'd do anything for her family and friends, and she's experiencing a common problem: she doesn't know what to do next after her lifelong dream hasn't exactly gone as she had planned. However, while she has the qualities that make for a likable character, I couldn't bring myself to care about her. There was nothing about her that truly stood out to me, nothing that made her story feel compelling. Her voice didn't capture me, and while I did hope that she found herself again, I wasn't committed enough to find out if she did. 2) The Set-Up - The Recipe Box contains multiple POVs/time periods. I understood what Viola was aiming for here - showing how multiple generations of Sam's family have found their way during tough times - but I wasn't a big fan of how it was presented. The change in POVs felt choppy, and given the length of the chapters, it was sometimes hard to remember what was going on before the change. Additionally, like with Sam, I couldn't bring myself to care about these women. I wanted to, I really did, but nothing sparkled here. In all, The Recipe Box unfortunately wasn't the book for me. My big problem here was the characters. The premise itself was interesting, and I feel that if you like the characters, it would be an enjoyable read. So if it seems like the book for you give it a try! Hopefully you'll love it. *ARC was provided by the publisher via Netgalley in exchange for an honest review* Book Blog | Twitter |  Bloglovin |  Goodreads"}, {"userName": "Sarah", "userReviewDate": "Mar 18, 2018", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/334766-sarah", "userReview": "Sam gets fired from her prestigious-on-paper pastry chef job in New York City and returns home to northern Michigan with her tail between her legs. She is struggling with striking the balance between what she thinks she should be doing and what actually makes her happy. Not unlike many self discovery novels, Sam is her own worst enemy when it comes to both romantic relationships and her career. Sam needs to look no further for answers than her own family. Which is where this all goes wrong for me. Metaphors hang heavy with folksy wisdom and are constantly referenced and acknowledged by the seemingly flaw free characters, the magical grandma in particular. The homespun and cozy care Sam receives feels like being hit over the head with a pie plate over and over again. You will not be surprised that shared family history is just the balm Sam needs. This is a world of syrupy sweet goodness, an unrelenting tone that feels overwhelming false. On the positive front, and why I actually finished this is the lovingly described setting of Suttons Bay in northern Michigan. The atmosphere was a wee bit over done, but it feels like a love letter to Pure Michigan. This would be a good read for fans of gentle reads like Jan Karon or Richard Paul Evans."}, {"userName": "Debbie", "userReviewDate": "Apr 05, 2018", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/3527423-debbie", "userReview": "The Recipe BoxViola ShipmanSTORY 5:Shipman\u2019s (Wade Rouse) latest charmer The Recipe Box is all about family, family traditions, family in transition and passing the torch on to the next generation its also about choices and wanting to make your own mark on the world. The main protagonist in this novel, Sam, is a genuine caring woman who is looking for herself and how this intuitive author lets her do that is remarkable. With a soft soothing introspective narrative told in different timelines from the perspective of the amazing women in this family he weaves this tale and draws readers into the life and times of this family of survivors giving the audience a fly on the wall look into their celebrations and sacrifices. The family dynamics are spot-on especially the mother-daughter-grandmother and the tender love stories spun into the fabric of the tale give it heart. But the best part of it all is Love and the family\u2019s motto \u201cPie equals 3.1415 oh who are we kidding, pie equals love\u201d. The other amazing thing this novel did for me personally was to inspire me to start my own family tradition and this coming Christmas my daughter will receive a special handcrafted recipe box with many of my own favorite as well as recipes from family and friends inside and who knows maybe one day it\u2019ll inspire yet another author to write about it.NARRATION 5:Susan Bennett\u2019s narration was spectacular and gives an extra element of realism to the story drawing listeners into the tale. With her soft soothing articulate voice she nails all the parts wonderfully both male and female but her rendition of grandma Willoe was unforgettable and takes me back to my own childhood baking with my grandma and hearing stories about my family. SUMMARY:When Samantha (Sam) Nelson was growing up her family\u2019s multi-generational orchard and bakery business in northern Michigan was her whole world until one day she felt like one of the treats made from leftover dough and sprinkled with sugar and cinnamon called misfits that her family\u2019s bakery was famous for. Then her dreams changed and instead of staying she longed to spread her wings and become a world famous pastry chef. After successfully completing college and culinary training in New York she was well on her way until an unfortunate stint working as a sous chef for a narcissistic former reality show star who couldn\u2019t bake to save his life. Now she\u2019s out of a job, lost with her dreams shattered so she heads to her safe place, home, to lick her wounds with full intentions of heading back to the big bustling city. But while there she\u2019s reminded of the joy of baking with her mom and grandma and learns of the struggles her parents, grandparents and great-grandparents faced keeping the orchard in the family and finds herself rethinking what her dreams really are."}, {"userName": "Tina at A COZY GIRL READS AND WRITES Blog", "userReviewDate": "Apr 07, 2018", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/4477360-tina-at-a-cozy-girl-reads-and-writes-blog", "userReview": "Review coming soon"}, {"userName": "Jeanne Adamek", "userReviewDate": "May 07, 2018", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/27905637-jeanne-adamek", "userReview": "Very much recommended--and (I think) to be read at a time when \"life\" just isn't quite going the way one wants..."}, {"userName": "Diane Perry", "userReviewDate": "Dec 23, 2017", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/11185453-diane-perry", "userReview": "I received this book from Netgalley in exchange for an honest review.
