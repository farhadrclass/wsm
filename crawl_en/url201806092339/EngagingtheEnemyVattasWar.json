It was particularly funny as Ky and Raf read through one planet\u2019s written rules for fornication.\u201cEngaging the Enemy\u201d also continues providing each character with individual personalities. Stella became annoying for awhile, and Furman was certainly not wanting Ky to succeed\u2026even taking her to court claiming Ky wasn\u2019t Ky. That presented quite the surprise!\u201cEngaging the Enemy\u201d is even longer than either of the first two Vatta books: 15 and 1/2 hours, and still filled with wonderful adventures and personalities, narrated wonderfully by Cynthia Holloway.

I WILL MAKE A FEW COMMENTS ABOUT THE BOOK BUT THE RATING IS ABOUT THIS AUDIO VERSION.Some of you may know that Elizabeth Moon wrote one of my all time favorites series including a trilogy I think of as one novel. So I hate that I've never been able to like her space operas. I mean I've tried and the first in this series was pretty good but I just haven't been able to get involved.HOWEVER I got the audio version of this book and I've got to say...the reader drove me completely away. I don't understand why publishers or whoever will contract a mediocre to poor reader to read a book. Do they never listen to their own product???I mean the trilogy I mentioned above (That I like so well) is The Deed of Paksenarrion. I own them in both print and audio and the reader of those while not as bad as the reader of this book is still not what I'd call \"up to it\". I just don't get it.I mean the reader here seems to think that...the-way-to-sound-dramatic-is-to-pause-between-each-word or two.So, I couldn't take it. I put it aside. maybe I'll find the print version and give it a try.

There is little doubt someone or someones are out to get Vatta Transport, Ltd, but now other trading companies are under attack as well. Ky\u2019s novice Captain skills are put to the test again as she tries to avoid trouble and postpone her grief. Corleigh has been hit hard and her childhood home is destroyed. With ansibles still down and communication at a stand still, the only question is: is her family safe or have they become victims of the explosion?At this point, Ky\u2019s proven she has the ability, not just the potential, to be a great captain. When she\u2019s approached by her cousin Stella, Ky automatically takes command, unafraid for the consequences but more likely: willing and able to deal when the time comes. She\u2019s independent and pragmatic, nothing at all like Stella; the contrast (both physical and personality-wise) between the two makes for an interesting dynamic which Moon does not fail to take advantage of. Although I did feel Stella\u2019s characterization was a bit different from how she acted in Marque and Reprisal.Stella is, almost from her first appearance here, bitter and resentful of Ky. She devolved very quickly into jealousy and her anger is too apparent not to notice. This, in light of the misunderstood, competent young woman whose current actions and abilities spoke volumes against past indiscretions did wonders for her character. Stella in action was quite different from the second hand descriptions of her. Others had low expectations of her. Her personal restraint and quiet confidence proved otherwise. Even Aunt Gracie thought more highly of her strongest abilities than other family members did of her, family that could not get past her weakest moments.This woman was not the same Stella present in Engaging the Enemy. In fact, she came across as more emotionally unstable and petulant than anything else. To be fair, she also did a very impressive job at whatever Ky assigned or essentially left her to deal with. Stella was in a difficult situation in this book at every moment. My only complaint is she did not handle it well when confronting Stella. How could she? How would anyone react in private, personal conversations with so much pent up irritation? I caution that I may be too harsh on Stella; she ran the gamut of emotion and not everyone can shoulder as many burdens without breaking at some point. I still consider her to be one of my favorite characters, second only to Aunt Gracie.We saw some of Grace Vatta\u2019s secrets at the beginning of Marque and Reprisal. Her cunning spy work and covert deliveries belong to a woman with much more experience than the average \u201cdotty\u201d old woman. And she does not fail to disappoint readers looking for more of a peek into her character. Without spoiling the plot I can\u2019t reveal too much more, but trust me that I hope we get to learn more about her in the final two books. She is, much like a Transformer, more than meets the eye.There was one other character I was more interested in: Zavala. From a planet named Ciudad in the Loma Linda group and with a ship called Dona Florenzia, I began to suspect Moon drew heavily from existing Earth cultures to develop this man. With the additional distrust of women in power and a ridiculous sense of honor, I began to get a bad taste in my mouth at the choice of culture chosen being represented a bit negatively. Clearly, Zavala is drawn from Spanish-speaking cultures, but I found this curious since I haven\u2019t found any other characters with as strong (I should say: obvious) real-world influence as he had (there are probably more that I haven\u2019t recognized!). His customs are ridiculed and not considered feasible and in this way completely disrespected. But of course, I couldn\u2019t be too critical here since the source of the incredulity was mostly from an incompetent Admiral and not entirely likable character. Ultimately, Zavala proved his worth and I\u2019m grateful Moon included such diversity in honestly, a realistic way. And to be fair: the Cascadians were the best example of culture clash in this book.Engaging the Enemy has the misfortune to be the middle novel in a five book series. It has to sustain the plot up until this point and carry it forth into the last two books. This gives middle books a large disadvantage. It cannot have the exciting novelty of the first, nor the satisfaction of the last. The middle book inhabits the fictional landscape between these two sides: somewhere beyond discovery, but before journey\u2019s end. Of course, the middle book also holds great potential, especially in its position to entertain us when the adrenaline has begun to seep out of the protagonist\u2019s system and the end is still too far away to reach in a day, but close enough to see.With a series of five books, the middle can so easily plateau with action. Engaging the Enemy felt a little like that for me, much to my disappointment. While I did enjoy some of the deeper characterization of Grace and Stella, very little happened plot-wise that didn\u2019t involve an inordinate amount of procedure that I honestly felt should have happened \u201coff-screen.\u201d The majority of the book suffered from the tedium of red tape and shopping assignments (toilets, textiles, canine sperm) that included selling as well as buying for ownership and trade. Kylara may be the captain of a trading vessel, she may be acting as a privateer to reestablish Vatta Transport, Ltd, but I wasn\u2019t as engaged in the narrative as much when I was drawn through the dull routine of Vatta\u2019s world. The world-building was a bit too much for me in this book, especially when Ky\u2019s world revolves around very uninteresting trade cargo.I feel very conflicted about this series, having now finished the first three books. Elizabeth Moon\u2019s writing can be extremely compelling. I don\u2019t argue that any difficulties I find are there. On the contrary, her writing is part of what has kept me reading this long. With a lesser author, I feel I would have given up a long time ago. I just wish most of the action in Engaging the Enemy wasn\u2019t confined to the last 50 pages, especially when the rest of the book didn\u2019t encourage it.There was more suspicion and mystery here, more revelatory plot information that\u2019s extremely relevant to the series as whole, but not too conducive to the type of heart-pounding excitement of the first two books. There\u2019s something mellow in this book, something of a respite before the real fighting begins. I can only hope the next will deliver on the promises of it\u2019s predecessors."}, {"userName": "The Captain", "userReviewDate": "Jun 07, 2018", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/54489623-the-captain", "userReview": "Ahoy there me mateys!

While I try to post no spoilers, if ye haven\u2019t read the first book and ye keep reading this log then ye have been forewarned and continue at yer own peril . . .Well book one could have been a standalone but I am extremely glad it wasn't! The second book quickly brings about a major, surprising change for the main character, Ky Vatta, and her family. It was mind-boggling but brilliant. It certainly upped the ante. I loved the crazy mercenary company and how Ky made deals with them. I loved all the space battles. It even makes trading goods interesting.Ky continues to be a delight. I love watching her get into impossible situations and use her brain and her gusto to solve problems. These books be action-packed, have no real romance, and be filled with admirable women. I particularly love Grandma Grace. She is one tough cookie.The only minor quibble was the distrust between Ky and her cousin in book three. It made sense in terms of story telling but it did wear on me a bit. I think that overall this book, while enjoyable, felt more like a placeholder set-up book.

Does that make sense? Vatta\u2019s War is just such a fun and compelling space opera with a strong central character, and Elizabeth Moon is a great storyteller. I say this while simultaneously admitting that, even though I really, really enjoyed reading Engaging the Enemy, I don\u2019t think it\u2019s actually all that good of a book.Yeah, this is going to be one of those reviews. Buckle up. (Spoilers for previous books but not this one.)Engaging the Enemy opens with Kylara and Stella Vatta plotting their next move. Leaving Stella in command of the Gary Tobai, Ky departs for a system that is more likely to recognize her prize claim to the Fair Kaleen, which she wrested from her pirate uncle in the previous book. What ensues is basically Ky trying to get her prize recognized as legitimate while also forming a governments-funded space navy to fight the organized pirates that appear to be disrupting trade. Meanwhile, she leaves Stella mostly to fend for herself, which Stella doesn\u2019t appreciate. And back on Slotter\u2019s Key, Aunt Grace has to get all wetwork on government-sponsored assassins. It\u2019s pretty cool.This book\u2019s strengths are similar to the previous books in the series. Moon does make anything easy for our protagonists. There are no convenient outs here, no crowning moments when someone waltzes in with exactly the right plan to save the day. If anything, the running gag in this book is that everything Ky does makes her situation worse\u2014except that she continually manages, against all odds, to survive. I love these books because I love watching Ky struggle and agonize over her decisions, over the burden of command on her young shoulders, and most recently, the loss of her family. Moon sends her and her associates through the wringer, yet Ky still has only one thing in sight: stopping the people who started this mess.On balance, though, I have to admit that there is little of note about this third book in the series. I mean, Moon basically relies on two things to stymie Ky: communication difficulties (or people not being in the right place at the right time) and other people being obstreperous buffoons. There is very little action here; most of the conflict comes from Ky navigating legal challenges, including dealing with the possibility that someone is going to accuse her crew of stealing a dog.Also, not a big fan of the conflict between Ky and Stella. Its existence makes total sense, but the way Moon has written it makes it sound so contrived and really doesn\u2019t do justice to Stella. Her attitude towards Ky is totally justified, especially considering the stress that both Vattas are under after the deaths of their family. Yet Moon essentially hands Stella the Idiot Ball to drum up enough tension while trying to get us to doubt whether Ky is even actually Ky.So, yeah, I can\u2019t pretend that this book is a masterpiece of plotting, conflict, and characterization. But I can\u2019t deny that it still satisfied every space opera bone in my body. I curled up with this over the weekend and just revelled in the atmosphere of this universe. That\u2019s the thing about science fiction: even the pulpy stuff (and, to be clear, Engaging the Enemy is far from pulp) feels so good. The very act of inhabiting a hypothetical future, of imagining space travel and space pirates and space \u2026 uh \u2026 legal wrangling \u2026 is such a fulfilling, stimulating experience. And despite perhaps failing to create a truly compelling story here, Moon still has this fantastic world.And even though her actions aren\u2019t all that interesting in this book, Ky herself remains a great protagonist. The major theme here is how to deal with having killed someone, with having to kill someone\u2014and what you do when you discover that you liked it. Ky\u2019s brain is basically asking, \u201cWhat if I\u2019m a bad person?\u201d on repeat, and you can see this weighing heavily with her every decision. There is some great psychological tension here, and I\u2019m not talking about the paternity plot.There is so much here that Moon could have done better, but in the end \u2026 I just don\u2019t care.

The military aspects of the story ring more true than in a lot of fiction, no doubt because the author, Elizabeth Moon, served in the Marine Corps. Her academic background in history helps with the grand politics and strategy that form the background and drive the story, too.Excellent characterization, good plotting and suspense, strong action scenes, and varied and colorful worlds and cultures.

I intend victory.\u201dEngaging the Enemy is the third book in Elizabeth Moon\u2019s VATTA\u2019S WAR saga. Young captain Kylara Vatta, her beautiful cousin Stella Vatta, and their elderly Aunt Grace continue their quest for revenge on the people who destroyed the Vatta shipping empire and most of the Vatta family. They are just beginning to realize the extent of the vast conspiracy which brought the Vattas down \u2014 it involves space pirates, a disgruntled renegade cousin, a traitorous ship captain, and the government of their home planet, Slotter Key.While Ky and Stella are out in space dodging assassination attempts and looking for allies, they have to deal with mercenaries, ship captains from different cultures, and more than one planet\u2019s ridiculous system of government. Finally Moon begins to show us the cultural distinctions between the different planets we visit. Some of this is pretty amusing and reminds me a little of Jack Vance\u2019s ability to highlight silly human behaviors by emphasizing a particular inane behavior in one of his created cultures. Elizabeth Moon does something similar here. Mostly she\u2019s making fun of bureaucracy and it adds a nice bit of levity to her story.Ky is getting stronger and growing into her role as the commander of an interplanetary military force. She\u2019s still worried about her discovery that she enjoys killing bad guys and we, along with her cousin Stella, are starting to worry a little, too. There are some moral dilemmas for Ky \u2014 on more than one occasion she has to decide whether it\u2019s ethical to kill or torture one person for the greater good. Ky doesn\u2019t think about this for very long before making her decisions \u2014 does that make her morally inferior or superior?Aunt Gracie is probably Elizabeth Moon\u2019s best character in this series. Because the enemies have brought down the ansibles that allow for interplanetary communications, she\u2019s out of touch with Ky and Stella. Here we see her scheming in the background, targeting the president of Slotter Key. Her story takes less space than Ky\u2019s but it\u2019s always exciting. Elderly Aunt Grace may not be involved in space battles, but she kicks butt nonetheless.Stella, on the other hand, is weak in this installment. She has so much potential to be a great strong character, but so far Moon doesn\u2019t seem to be sure what Stella\u2019s purpose is. In the previous books she seemed to be a hero in her own right, but this time Moon seems to be using her to make Ky look better in contrast. Too bad. Why can\u2019t Stella be awesome, too? I hope she\u2019ll be back on track in the next book.Most of the plot of Engaging the Enemy focuses on Ky meeting and strategizing with potential allies, equipping her ships, hiring crew, worrying about her relationship to her home planet, and trying to decide what her role is in the struggle for revenge. Too much of this is tedious and repetitive. I\u2019ve mentioned in a review of an earlier book in this series that I enjoy the focus on trading and transportation logistics, so I feel a little forgiving about this, but many readers will think it\u2019s just plain boring. There\u2019s not much action from Ky\u2019s storyline until the very end of the book when there\u2019s a trial, a surprising revelation about the Vatta family, and a major military engagement.Despite the deceptive title of the book, there isn\u2019t a lot of action in Engaging the Enemy. However, the story advances and there are welcome revelations and some good character development. I\u2019m rating Engaging the Enemy a little lower than the previous installments just because there\u2019s less action, some of the plot elements feel like they\u2019re there just to add drama, and there\u2019s too much boring red tape. Still, somehow Elizabeth Moon keeps me reading and there\u2019s no way I\u2019m giving up on the Vatta family now.

(I somehow had the misapprehension that there were only 4 in the series - luckily the public library came through and got me #5 expediently!)Due to a misjudgement, Kylara Vatta, scion of an interstellar shipping business, gets kicked out of military academy shortly before graduation. She's pretty crushed by the end of her hopes for a military career, but there's always the family business to fall back on... or is there? Someone's apparently got it out for her family, and before Ky knows it, she's catapulted into the midst of a space war, seeking justice and vengeance against an unsavory alliance of pirates.These are first and foremost action-adventure books, with plenty of shoot-em-up scenes and an uncomplicated moral compass - you know who the 'bad guys' are, and although Ky is normally affected by the trauma of war (even seeking therapy at one point), she's always clearly on the side of right. The one thing I wished the story had was more exploration of the bad guys' motivations - OK, we know they're racist, and bigoted against 'modified' humans (people who've had either genetic or physical/technological augmentation), and of course they want power - but what's the story behind it all?However, the characters of the 'good guys' are well-drawn, and the story's definitely recommended for those who like strong female characters: there's Ky, with her military and strategic brilliance, her cousin Stella, who has the financial and business acumen to bring Vatta Enterprises back from the brink - and there's their grandmother, Grace, who is far from being the harmless old lady people might assume. (Grace might be my favorite character - it's wonderful to see an older woman portrayed with such verve.)As many have mentioned, there are some definite parallells here with Lois McMaster Bujold's Vorkosigan saga.

In a delightful way, Engaging the Enemy explores the real meaning of family. Of course, I\u2019m more hooked than ever because the personalities of the characters are becoming more complex. Characters that I considered to be NPCs (quick, superficial stereotypes used by Game Masters in role-playing games) proved to have their own needs, hopes, and fears in a rich, rewarding way. I was particularly thrilled with the way Auntie Grace stepped out of her 2D caricature and became a character in her own right. Without creating a spoiler, let\u2019s just say that within the events of this installment, Ky Vatta gets a clearer view of who the real enemy is. Of course, she has to consider for a brief time whether that enemy might not be herself. Indeed, Engaging the Enemy is also significant because it begins to give everyone in the ensemble cast a chance to demonstrate their expertise (at least, after an adequate amount of time for everyone to second-guess everyone else).

I think Stella\u2019s story line may be the least interesting of the three, possibly because she faces very little resistance to anything she tries to do.

They now have two ships but no cohesion regarding who will be the leader and how to rebuild the company. Kylara realizes that she needs to get a band of armed merchant ships together to take out the pirates. Once she does though she quickly realizes how untrained and unequipped they are. Plus she is forced to work under a poor leader. The secrets revealed in this book was shocking. It made the reader question what constitutes family: it is genes, who raised you or your morals. I liked how the characters realized family isn't about genetics, some authors go that way and it annoys me. The characters were good but Stella seemed too angry over everything. I'm glad that she found her preferred occupation at the end which I'm hoping will chill her out. The battle at the end was intense. There was a massive show of egotism, ageism and general stupidity. The lessons learned will be needed for future battles. Overall an enjoyable novel with the perfect amount of action, suspense and character development."}, {"userName": "Jason", "userReviewDate": "Jul 31, 2009", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/1205474-jason", "userReview": "I picked up the first two books in the Vatta\u2019s War series out of curiosity, and because I thought they probably weren\u2019t very good. I wanted to see what modern military science fiction was like. They turned out better than I expected, enough so that I\u2019ve been curious about the rest of the series. I began Engaging the Enemy with the hopes that it would be faster and more exciting than the previous two books.Summary\tHaving defeated the family renegade and pirate, Osman, Ky Vatta attempts to register her new, captured warship under her own name while rebuilding her family\u2019s business and organizing a \u201cmerchant fleet\u201d to defeat the pirates that are now attempting to take over planetary governments.2.6\tOverallSatisfactory with positive exceptions\tNothing really happens in Engaging the Enemy. After the exciting conclusion of Marque and Reprisal, this book is a step back as Ky Vatta and her family try to deal not only with the bull\u2019s-eye painted on their family, but with deeper interpersonal issues as well. I wasn\u2019t expecting this angle, but Moon is able to keep the narrative interesting (though I\u2019m not sure how she does that).\tThe glaring thing about this, whether it\u2019s good or bad, is the story structure. After three hundred pages without anything happening, there is a kind of climax (that requires almost no effort by any of the protagonists) that left me on the downward track to final conclusion. Instead the author changes gears (or you might say \u201crushes\u201d) into a new situation and a new climax. Unfortunately, it was \u201ctoo little, too late\u201d for me, and I was ready to be finished.\tI\u2019ll read the next book. I\u2019ll even probably reread the first two and maybe this one, but I think anyone going in should know that these books aren\u2019t military sci-fi or space opera. They do take place in space and there are occasional fights, but at this point they\u2019re really more about survival, with yourself and the universe around you, and the life of traders and merchants.2.5\tCharactersSatisfactory with positive exceptions\tIt has taken time for some of these characters to stick, but I began to enjoy them in this book. Ky spent less time complaining to herself, though she\u2019s still a pushover (I realize people could disagree, given the record of unfriendly systems she leaves behind her, but she always leaves quietly after making herself unwelcome). Rafe was fun (although he didn\u2019t do very much), and Martin is grizzled. My only real complaint is that there are several new characters that are uninteresting (but are treated as though they\u2019re important). Maybe more will come of them in the following books.3\tPaceGood\tElizabeth Moon really confounds me. I have never seen an author work through two or three hundred pages without anything really happening. Ky basically travels to different systems, gets into arguments, and then moves on. Stella (Ky\u2019s cousin) follows a similar plan, though she spends every free moment worrying that Ky has turned into a monster. The real excitement is back on their home world of Slotter Key, where their aged aunt, Grace, kills spies.\tBut Moon keeps it all interesting.2\tStorySatisfactory\tNothing happens in this story. As I said before, Ky flies around. Stella worries. Grace kills a few people. Moon keeps us interested by inviting us into the lives of the characters and their daily worries and routines.\tWhat is troubling to me is the general structure of this story, and thus this may be a complaint better said about the pace, but I\u2019m putting it here: the climax of the novel, for me, came around page 300 with one-hundred pages to go. It\u2019s not much of a climax, and then the book slows down again, and then the author rushes into a new situation and a new climax that almost feels as though it should have been put in the next book. The final scenes are exciting (and allow the book to be called \u201cmilitary SF\u201d), but my investment ran out at Furman\u2019s trial. Everything had just been so slow before that point I was out of interest at that point.\tKy has extraordinary luck in meeting complete strangers and alien cultures that are unusually friendly and helpful, defusing some of the tension that had been built.\tFinally, the events earlier in the book don\u2019t seem to have anything to do with the finale. Nothing is hinted, nothing is connected. Questions are left unanswered (what happened to the two Vattas on Furman\u2019s ship?), and the result is an interesting, if disjointed, tale.2.5\tDialogueSatisfactory with positive exceptions\tDialogue in science fiction is a difficult animal, because who knows how speech will change in the future? Instead of absolute accuracy, clarity and a general feeling of familiarity are needed. The characters in this book are occasionally long-winded, and frequently speak in perfect sentence structures that don\u2019t feel real, but at least the communication is clear (most of the time) in a book sprinkled with technological, science fiction, and business terms that a lot of people wouldn\u2019t understand otherwise.2.5\tStyle/TechnicalSatisfactory with positive exceptions\tIf it weren\u2019t for the last couple of chapters, I would have rated this higher. Moon can tell a story that people can understand, but in the final act (epilogue?) she switches to technical terms that I only really understood because I grew up playing video games. The ending battle (and only fight of the story, except for Grace\u2019s contention with spies on Slotter Key) is not dynamic or treated like a \u201cliving\u201d thing. The spaceships fly, they shoot, they raise shields, some of them blow up. The panic and humanity of conflict, the desperation of Ky\u2019s command and her plan to swing around a planet\u2019s gravity well, are treated in such technical terms it was impossible for me to maintain any kind of emotional connection with the events."}, {"userName": "Elise Stone", "userReviewDate": "Aug 24, 2017", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/5148058-elise-stone", "userReview": "I loved the first two books, but this one was a disappointment.
