Vivian, the youngest of the Sinclair sisters comes to Cripple Creek to join her three sisters and to flee her past. But what starts out so innocently turns into a bigger mess than Vivian could have imagined. Each step making it harder to make the right choice. There is also the sheriff, Carter Alwyn, what will he think when he finds out about her secrets? Third in the Brides of Cripple Creek series, fans of the series will be happy to finally read about the youngest Sinclair sister. While it is not absolutely necessary that you read the first two books first, I believe that it would be extremely helpful. I read the first book, so I knew about two of the sisters, but I haven't read the second book yet, so I had some catching up to do!There were times that I will honestly say that this book was difficult to read, when Vivian kept making more and more bad choices. I just wanted to be able to tell her, \"No, please don't do that!\" But this story had a surprisingly powerful message, that no matter how many mistakes she made, and the harder it got to get out, she still had a choice, and she could always turn to the Lord. One of the side stories that I really appreciated was the one of Nell (one of the sisters from the first book) and her husband, who wanted children, but it just wasn't happening for them. But of course, if you want to know what happens you'll have to read and find out :)Overall this was a terrific read! I loved how it updated me on the former characters, yet introduced new ones. This was a pretty riveting read considering how I read this book in less than one day, in a 4 hour sitting, to be more exact! And I will most certainly be picking up the second book as soon as can. The Bride Wore Blue is a book I would happily recommend, it is definitely a book that sticks with you long after the last page is turned down.I received this book from the publisher in return for and honest review."}, {"userName": "Paula-O", "userReviewDate": "Apr 07, 2012", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/3327000-paula-o", "userReview": "The Sinclair Sisters of Cripple Creek Series by Mona Hodgson book #3\"The Bride Wore Blue\"This is the story of the \"Baby\" of the family Vivian, a young woman with a will of her own and tired of being referred to as the youngest.Vivian has made some mistakes in her life and feels she is unworthy and not \"up-to\" standards of her older sisters. The sisters had came from Maine to Cripple Creek in Colorado and now there will be a reunion as sister #3 arrives to join them. In books 1&2 we saw the sisters find worthy mates and marry and settle into their lives as good upstanding citizens.This unworthy feeling gets her into a lot of trouble as you will see when you read the book. Vivian seems to go from bad to worse as she tries to find a job to support herself in Cripple Creek. She did not want to come to this small town-she wanted to be with her dad in France and pursue a career of fashion designer- from a young age she had liked to sketch and was very good at it. When she meets the sheriff's deputy Carter Alwyn she is determined she will not get close to this man. Men are not to be trusted in her estimation.Carter a deputy sheriff feels his job lets him bring justice when there is a wrong and he remembers his dad saving a young woman who had been kidnapped that no one else wanted to help because she came from the seedier side of life-namely a prostitute. He feels he has to stay single to protect a woman from living married to a man taking chances and possibly getting killed leaving her alone. He first meets and sees Vivian as a sweet young innocent woman and is so dissappointed when he finds out how she has lied and has so many secrets about her life in Cripple Creek...Can he forgive her and get back that \"good feeling\" he had when he met her.Mona has her job cut out for her in this book. Read and learn how by the Grace of God these two young people make amends and learn to live again -there is forgivness and Grace if you take the time to notice as the family is reunited at the end of story.I was given this book by WaterBrook Multinoman Publishing Grp for an honest review and I loved reading and doing so..."}, {"userName": "Romancing the Book", "userReviewDate": "Feb 22, 2014", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/5328566-romancing-the-book", "userReview": "Reviewed by AngieBook provided by a GoodReads contest winReview originally posted at Romancing the BookThe Bride Wore Blue is an inspirational story of an 18 year old girl named Vivian who\u2019s made some mistakes and is desperate for a new start. Unwanted by her father in Paris, Vivian sets off for Cripple Creek, Colorado with her Aunt to reunite with her sisters.First and foremost, I NEED to get my hands on the first two books in this series. I didn\u2019t check when I asked to read this book so I\u2019m unfamiliar with the family. While you could read this on it\u2019s own, I think it\u2019s probably best to read the whole series.This is such a heartwarming novel about forgiveness \u2013 forgiving yourself, having others forgive you, and accepting God\u2019s forgiveness. It\u2019s also about love {sisterly love, friendly love, and God\u2019s unconditional and ever abiding love} and acceptance. The messages are unmistakable; told in a gentle way.Vivian is stronger than she thinks and is probably my favorite of the sisters; yes, I know, I\u2019ve only read this one, but you somewhat get to know the personalities of the other sisters and I have to say that I identify with her wholeheartedly.Even the secondary characters come alive and worm their way into your hearts. You don\u2019t learn everything about Carter\u2019s past, but enough to know the demons he\u2019s fighting.I love how understated the love between all couples was, but you knew just how very, very much everyone genuinely loved each other.

The youngest Sinclair, the family\u201c baby\u201d, is moving from Maine to Cripple Creek, Colorado and joining Kat, Nell, and Ida. But Vivian is a young woman with a will of her own, and made some decisions back in Portland that have begun to haunt her.

The youngest Sinclair sister is determined to make her own way, so when she\u2019s offered a job as a hostess in a sporting house, she takes it, thinking the position is appropriate for a tainted, unlovable woman like herself. Although she\u2019s convinced she\u2019ll never be asked to entertain privately, Vivian keeps her employment a secret from her sisters, knowing they\u2019d be mortified\u2014as will Carter Alwyn, the kind and godly sheriff \u2019s deputy who\u2019s sweet on her.Vivian is descending into a life of secrets, lying to the very people who love her and could help her heal from her mistakes. Will an outpouring of grace remind her that she is still God\u2019s beloved and that her past can be washed as clean as Rocky Mountain snow?My thoughts: This is a very enjoyable read of the American West in 1867. Cripple Creek is a small western town with limited prospects for employment and yet Vivian wants to be able to stand on her own two feet and begin working as a designer of ladies clothing. But prospects are dim.Vivian has secrets in her young life that no one is aware of - least of all her sisters. She has tried to put them behind her and live her life according to God's leading, but she continually finds herself being deceptive and not choosing wisely. She does not seek the assistance and counsel of those who love her. So she makes mistakes. Big mistakes.This is a story of the American West and the book brings good christian fiction, sweet romance, wild west outlaws, soiled doves, and a train robbery all lending color and adventure. But you won't find inappropriate scenes or language to spoil it for you. Being a Western style story, we have a hero, too - Deputy Carter Alwyn. So watch out for tender sparks between Vivian and the Deputy Carter.Character development is good and each personality shows through. You will fall in love with Hattie. (I'll not tell who she is so you can read the book and find out!) And the sub-sub-plot of Nell and her husband desiring a child and being unable to have one resolves itself in a beautiful way. (Again, I'm not going to give this sweet morsel away!)But this is a story of forgiveness. God's grace and forgiveness and that of those we love. No matter how big or terrible our mistakes, God is gracious and God is forgiving. You will find an inspirational read in The Bride Wore Blue by Mona Hodgson that will be an encouragement to you if you need forgiveness and a source of helping others whom you know who need to realize the forgiveness of God and that of friends and loved ones.You will also find family loyalty and acceptance toward Vivian even after her mistakes and secrets are discovered.The Bride Wore Blue can easily be read as a stand alone book although it would be fun to read the entire series in the order in which they were written. I look forward to reading Mona Hodgson's new release in October 2012 of Twice a Bride.DISCLOSURE: I was provided a copy of The Bride Wore Blue by Blogging for Books on behalf of Waterbrook Press and the author in exchange for my honest review.

The Bride Wore Blue is the third book in the Sinclair Sisters of Cripple Creek series. While I did not read the first two books in the series, the novel was written so that I was able to quickly connect with the characters and enjoy the story. The plot line was well written and had a couple surprising occurrences that added to the suspense and excitement of the story. The tone of the novel varied, and the author clearly showed the thoughts and feelings of the two main characters, Vivian and Carter. The characters of the story were fairly well developed and engaging. I liked Carter Alwyn. At times I thought he was too perfect, but I enjoyed seeing his growth and his confessions of hypocrisy and making some sins worse than others. Vivian was an interesting young woman. I liked her independence and boldness, but I was saddened to see her choices in life. I was pleased to see her growth as well and her realization of God's love and forgiveness. As Vivian realized, \"when faith should have sustained her and sent her into God's arms, she's wallowed in self-pity and turned to Gregory. Now she knew the difference between a superficial man and a man of deep faith and integrity. Her transgressions and the wrenching heartache that followed had readied her heart to receive God's grace.\" [The Bride Wore Blue, Kindle location 3240]. Overall, I enjoyed The Bride Wore Blue, I cannot wait to read the first two novels and the fourth novel in the The Sinclair Sisters of Cripple Creek series.

Her three older sisters lived there and had found success in the boom town. The problem standing in the way of her dreams was her past. She was sure she didn't deserve to be happy because of a mistake she made back in Maine.When job after job didn't work out, Vivian found herself submerged in a role that blurred the lines of the truth and lies. Vivian was turning farther and farther away from God. Every decision she made put her one more step out of His will.Cripple Creek's Deputy, Carter Alwyn, also had trouble letting go of the past. His father was killed while doing his job as a sheriff. Carter couldn't step out of his father's shadow. Still, Carter was growing closer to God. He was seeking God's will for his life.The growing town of Cripple Creek and it's townspeople are described in such a way that you know you're reading about the late 1800's. The dress of the people and the sights and surroundings of the area are shown well through words. The author doesn't let the reader know everything up front. Slowly the story unfolds and more and more is discovered about the characters. The subplot of bandits in the area that seems to be minor changes into a bigger story that involves death and kidnapping by the end.Vivian and Carter always had the past on their minds. Some people may find it unrealistic how they were so obsessed with it. Vivian could come off as a little snobby. She critiqued everyone's style of dress and wanted to change it. Vivian and Carter had an instant attraction to one another. But they let their pasts kept them apart. There is very little romance in this story because of this.Vivian's three sisters, Ida, Kat and Nell's stories from the previous books in the series continue but take a back seat to Vivian's story. I enjoyed the subplot with Nell and her husband's struggle to have children. Hattie owns the boardinghouse where Vivian is staying. She is like a mother to all the Sinclair Sisters.The Bride Wore Blue is story of forgiveness - giving it and receiving it. God's grace is bigger than our mistakes.

How about feeling unworthy of God\u2019s love? Can anyone love me when I\u2019ve\u2026? If you\u2019ve ever had those thoughts or feelings, you\u2019re not alone. The author does a wonderful job of exploring these questions through the eyes of her main character, Vivian Sinclair, and a supporting cast of her three sisters, a boardinghouse owner, and the deputy sheriff. The story is set in the late 1800s in Colorado. Vivian and her sisters have grown up as Christians. She is the fourth of four sisters and has never liked being the baby of the family. She longs for independence to show she can take care of herself. She makes some poor choices in her home town in Maine, and thinks that she can start a brand new life in Cripple Creek with her sisters. When she arrives in Cripple Creek, she meets the deputy sheriff, Carter Alwyn. They both are attracted to each other, but both are not wanting more than friendship. Vivian doesn\u2019t think she is worthy of anything more, and Carter doesn\u2019t want to drag a woman into the life of a lawman.Vivian tries to find a job, but is rejected time and time again. She is desperate for a paying job, and makes another poor choice. This job leads her to encounter some criminals who have been robbing banks and trains in the area. What happens to make Vivian a murder suspect? Can anyone ever forgive her? Her desperate situation causes her to turn back to God for help, and makes her realize her true feelings for Carter run much deeper than friendship. Carter is trying to catch the thieves and bring them to justice. He also realizes how much he wants a wife to share his life. Does Vivian feel the same?Once Carter learns the truth about her past, will he still have feelings for her? Will he be disgusted with her? The story shows the path of forgiveness, mercy, and compassion of God. It also shows the love that is shared by fellow Christians, and their mercy and willingness not to pass judgment.

I didn't know what to expect and went into reading this book with good intentions and wanting to really like this story. Maybe I was just looking for more heat so I was kind of disappointed when I came to the end and it just didn't have as much romance as I thought it would. The story however does well on the historical fiction front and I liked that aspect of it. I was even surprised to learn that a few of the characters in the novel were actually real people who existed in the late 1800's. So this was very interesting as well as the plot itself.The books main character is Vivian Sinclair and she has just arrived in Cripple Creek where her other three sisters now reside. The character of Vivian reminds me of a lady who is high maintenance, always completely dressed up even if she really has no where to go. I just could not relate to her character. Vivian is an artist who does sketching and designing and has designed numerous outfits and accessories for friends and family and she has her mind set on a job as a designer when when she arrives in Cripple Creek. However when Vivian cannot find a job designing or keep any job for that matter she ends up settling for anything she can get her hands on that will help her pay her rent. Not wanting to be dependent on her sisters Vivian weaves a web of lies to keep a job she is not to proud of. Carter Alwyn a bachelor and the sheriff of Cripple Creek met Vivian the first day she arrived in town and he immediately became attracted to her spunky nature. But Carter has some insecurities of his own that leave him having second thought about pursuing a relationship with Vivian.I found the characters lacked better deceptions of their past involvement with Vivian. It could be because the author wanted to keep the emphasis on Vivian. However I found to be a mistake for those of us like me who are coming into the series at an angle and don't really know any of the other characters well enough. I felt that if Hodgson would place a little more attention to giving a little more information on the other characters and just a little more feisty romance it could be a series I would look forward to."}, {"userName": "Meagan Myhren-bennett", "userReviewDate": "Jul 08, 2012", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/5477348-meagan-myhren-bennett", "userReview": "The Bride Wore BlueBy Mona HodgsonThe Bride Wore Blue is the third book in the Sinclair Sisters of Cripple Creek series.

I hope to read Twice a Bride, the fourth book in this series, very soon.Vivian may be the baby of the family, but after making a grievous mistake the previous year, she has done a lot of growing up. I thought she was such a believable character, and I felt an immediate connection with her.Shortly after Vivian arrives in Cripple Creek she begins to look for employment. However the town has recently suffered a fire and most of the local businesses have just rebuilt, so there are very few jobs available. She is told about a job as a hostess and thinks that is something she could do...that is until she learns it is in one of the sporting houses. However, when she loses one job, has to leave another and can't find work anywhere no matter how hard she tries, she decides to see what would be involved in that hostess job. When she is told that she wouldn't have to work upstairs, she decides to take it - thinking that it isn't that big of a deal to work there after what she did last year. Knowing that her family would never understand or condone her decision, she keeps her place of employment a secret from them...even going to great lengths to deceive one of her sisters when she comes across her on her way to her job.The Bride Wore Blue is a wonderful story. I think this book could be read be itself and you wouldn't feel that you are missing out on anything.

I also felt the the book just dragged on and on and was very slow in the beginning. Then when the \u201caction\u201d finally took place, it was rushed through. I also found it really hard to believe that none of her sisters would have helped her more in finding a job or even offer her a job, especially when they are supposedly so close. The story was predictable and I feel that the relationship between Vivian and Carter was rushed and the chemistry just lacking between them. It just didn\u2019t seem that their romance was well developed. Overall, I think Mona Hodgson writes well, but this book just didn\u2019t work for me. I really wanted to like The Bride Wore Blue, but for me it fell flat.NOTICE:Disclosure of Material Connection: I received this item free from the creator.

Vivian Sinclair is the baby sister of the bunch and she has finally made her way to Cripple Creek, Colorado, to join her other three sisters. She has missed her sisters terribly and can\u2019t wait to be near them again but that is not her only objective in moving. She is trying to make a new start for herself after suffering a broken heart and she is ready to try her wings at becoming a clothing designer. But nothing goes as she has planned and she finds herself making one poor choice after another in a desperate attempt to keep her head above water.I connected with this story from the get-go and was completely wrapped up in Vivian\u2019s adventures and mistakes along the way. I found all of the characters to be believable and the story to be well thought out. Not only was it an enjoyable read but it had a very strong message about the consequences of a choice. Even though Vivian should have known better in some areas, I found her to be portrayed as a woman who just allowed herself to be drawn into the wrong choices without intending to do the wrong thing. Any of us can have that happen if we are not careful, so I was pleased to see this depicted in a novel that could not only tell a captivating tale but could also encourage young and old alike to make the right choices. That is what I look for in Christian Fiction\u2014a good story with a good moral\u2014and this book delivered.

But when I was offered a chance to review this book from the publisher I jumped at the chance! And I am glad I did! I so enjoyed getting to know these characters, although I did have a bit of trouble keeping them all straight in the beginning, but I think this was probably because I haven't read the previous books, yet. The four sisters were all very unique and charming and their relationships with each other were very realistic. I am blessed to have a wonderful family that bands together through the good and the bad, so I will always love to read about families that do the same, this is one of those books! I loved the message of this book, learning that God still loves you unconditionally, even after you have sinned and although you feel unworthy, you have His forgiveness. Basically this story was awesome and I loved reading it! The only thing that kept me from giving it five stars was that it moved slowly and the plot line progressed slower than I would have liked. Because of this it could be kind of hard to get into the swing of things, but persevere, it is totally worth it! I very much enjoyed this book, honestly I usually stay away from series like this because I feel like most of them are all the same but this series has something unique and special about it. I know fans of this series will love this book and as a new fan of this author I am here to say that you do not need to read the previous books in order for this one to make sense. I love series like that. However I look forward to going back and reading the previous books. I absolutely recommend this book.

This time, \"baby sister\" Vivian is leaving Maine and heading to Cripple Creek, Colorado to join her contentedly-settled older siblings. Vivian has always marched to the beat of her own drummer, following her impulsive heart instead of her head, often meeting with disaster. Determined to make a fresh start and pursue her dream of becoming a successful fashion designer, she forges ahead by train, encountering a band of robbers and providing Deputy Sheriff Carter Alwyn with a sketch of the bandits. A search for work eventually lands Vivian a job as a hostess in a house of ill-repute. She hides her work from her sisters and also from Carter, who is quite taken with the youngest Sinclair sister. Due to poor decisions in her past, Vivian thinks that she is not worthy of Carter. He thinks the danger of his line of work in law enforcement makes him an unsuitable candidate for marriage. When a dangerous twist of fate brings Vivian's secrets to light, can those she loves forgive her? Author Mona Hodgson writes with appealing historical detail and creates compelling characters whom we want to find their happy ending. Forgiveness and self-acceptance are strong themes in \"The Bride Wore Blue\". Learning to truly forgive oneself and learn from our mistakes is a huge step toward growth of character and also enables us to be more tolerant of others. If you are a person of true faith, then forgiveness is already yours for the asking. It is what you do in your life with the blessing of benevolence that you receive that makes all the difference. A recommended series for lovers of inspirational historical romance."}, {"userName": "Judy", "userReviewDate": "Jul 07, 2012", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/1871221-judy", "userReview": "The Bride Wore Blue by Mona HodgsonThe Sinclair Sisters of Cripple Creek Book 3Vivian Sinclair is the youngest sister and the last to make the trip to Cripple Creek, Colorado.

She made a huge error in judgment that she knew cost her the love of a good man. And unfortunately even after the move her poor judgment continued in her choice of work. Decisions of her past kept her from any future, especially with the handsome deputy.Carter Alwyn liked the spunky newcomer the minute she stood up to him on the train when he came to ask questions about the robbery. Too bad he would never take a wife as long as he was a lawman. A beauty like Vivian Sinclair had him second guessing his career choice. Could two people let go of their pasts and have a new future?I really enjoyed this book. The author wrote a moving story on how God can forgive our sins and give us freedom from the past\u2026.even if others don\u2019t. The story also shows how Vivian\u2019s pride leads her down an even darker road than what she was on. How when we compare ourselves to others, we most likely won\u2019t live up to it. A well rounded story of love, forgiveness, adventure and prayers answered in unexpected ways.

I loved the storyline, and the main character made so many poor choices it was easy for me to identify with her! All of Mona's main characters have a a strong desire to achieve their goals and aren't afraid to take chances. I love the adventurous spirit reflected throughout the entire book.The storyline revolved around Vivian, the youngest Sinclair sister, who moves to Cripple Creek with dreams of being a fashion designer. When those dreams are squashed, followed by the failure of two successive jobs, she resorts to working in a brothel as a hostess for Pearl DeVere. One day she shockingly finds Pearl dead. Unfortunately, Pearl's boyfriend assumes that Vivian is the killer and sets out on revenge. The story only gets better when Vivian's love interest, the deputy of Cripple Creek, rescues her and discovers -- upon his dismay -- where she has been working. What a beautiful story of redemption and joy! Mona keeps it light and fun the entire way through. My favorite quote of the book came from Miss Hattie when she said, \"It's what we do in our future, dear, that decides how important our past truly was.\"Currently, this novel retails on Amazon for $11.40, or you can purchase the Kindle edition for only $9.99.

I thought this was a really interesting Christian fiction story that is the latest in the series from the author. This series is called The Sinclair Sisters of Cripple creek and This one is book 3. I have not read the other 2 in this series but now I really want to because I was really able to identify with the characters in This story. This is the story of Vivian who moves to Cripple creak to be with her sisters who have all gotten married and found love in this town. Vivian wants to be a fashion designer but in this smaller town of Cripple Creak finding a job is not easy. Vivian is also hiding a terrible secret about her past in Portland. This secret leads her to believe that she could not possibly be forgiven for the sin she committed and her damaged self esteem leads her to make some really bad choices. I Liked this story it touches on how sometimes we dwell so much on our failure's and sins we forget that God Knows us and forgives us. We get caught in the trap of being so ashamed about our behavior that we end up making even worst choices because we can't forgive ourselves. We forget that through Christ our sins are covered and should be put behind us. We forget to move forward and not dwell on the mistakes we made before. Dwelling on past sins only breads feelings of worthlessness and despair. We need to keep running the race, not wallowing in our failures. Christ forgives, he never asked us to wallow in despair."}, {"userName": "Patricia Kemp Blackmon", "userReviewDate": "Feb 22, 2012", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/5314062-patricia-kemp-blackmon", "userReview": "Vivian Sinclair is the youngest of the Sinclair sisters to arrive in Cripple Creek.

We are next to meet the youngest of the sisters, Vivian - who holds both surprises and secrets from her past. She comes to the township fully intending to make her own way in life and to put her love of design and fashion to good use. Sadly her best efforts to earn an honest living for herself as a single woman are sorely tested.Then there's the story of the sheriff's deputy - Carter Alywn is a man who knowns his town and is determined to keep it safe from bank and train robbers. When Vivian's train to Cripple Creek is robbed by said gang - their paths cross for the first time. Initially antagnositic and avoiding of one another - soon they both begin to realise that they can be friends and mayb more. I loved revisiting many well loved characters and catching up with their stories. Ultimately the story would still make sense even without reading the first two books it ceretainly adds a true serial nature to the stories to have the complete history at hand. The book also took some surprising turns and kept you guessing how the eventual ending would finally happened. Vivian's story is definetly one of making multple mistakes before realising that God's grace can indeed cover a multiude of sin and bring about a true transformation - blotting out all that went before.

This third book in the series gives the reader an in-depth look at the \"baby\" of the family, Vivian. I felt like Vivian had been a typical spoiled baby sister, wanting her own way before she went to join her older sisters in Cripple Creek, and had learned some hard life lessons in a very difficult way. Though she seemed to be more mature and to have learned from the mistakes in her past, she seemed to continue to resent her older sister's influence in her life at times, and I think it led to her making more mistakes that could possibly been avoided if she would have just taken the time to talk with one or more of them.This realistic sibling dynamic made the story much more enjoyable for me, as well as the estranged romance between Vivian and Deputy Alwyn. The overwhelming lesson of forgiveness, faith and acceptance is an integral part of the story from beginning to end. This heartwarming story is one that shows how forgiveness, love, and family loyalty can help overcome difficult circumstances. I also enjoyed the mystery and danger involved that gave the wild west type feel to this story that I really like. This is a good christian fiction romance, with some wild west outlaws, soiled doves, train robbery and so much more excitement thrown in the mix.

On the train ride over, bandits break onto the train and steal the cash box, but not before Vivian accidentally trips one of them. Her accidental heroics lead her to meet charming young Sheriff, Carter, who is immediately impressed with her sass and charm. Although she begins to develop feelings for him, she tries to avoid him by working hard at finding a job designing gowns. She \"soiled\" herself in Maine and doesn't think that she will ever find joy in family life like her sisters because no man will take a tainted woman (a secret that haunts her).

How far would you go to maintain your independence? That's Vivian Sinclair's dilemma in The Bride Wore Blue. The Sinclair sisters are a lot of fun. This is the first book in the \"Sisters of Cripple Creek\" series that I've read, but I thoroughly enjoyed it. Hodgson took a very serious problem - how to achieve financial independence - and a spiritual one - how to forgive yourself - and addressed them with historical accuracy, emotional depth, and enough lightheartedness to keep the story fun. Vivian's antics were often comical and her run-ins with Carter, a deputy, had enough zaniness to make you blush for her. Trying to untangle the mess she's made of her life, though, has a depth that is belied by the simplicity and beauty of the cover. The message is far deeper than what is normally contained in your typical 'romance' - and could prompt serious soul searching to those in need of personal forgiveness.Previews are included for Hodgson's next two books at the end of this one (as well as a reader's guide).
