It covers not only the major religions, but also some of the smaller religions throughout the world (e.g. Native American beliefs), providing a nice overview that also discussed more than just the religions with a single deity. Each religion was briefly introduced by the authors providing just enough information to get a grasp on the important points that would be encountered in the scriptures. By far, the best part of the book was the fact that the majority is made up from excerpts of actual religious texts (with a brief introduction to orient the reader). In this way, while you get a context from the authors through the introduction, the majority of information you encounter comes from the religious texts themselves!"}, {"userName": "Rapha Gabriel Benjamin", "userReviewDate": "Nov 03, 2013", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/25184016-rapha-gabriel-benjamin", "userReview": "I was quite disappointed actually I think it gives a narrow view of true religion and their scriptures, not giving an accurate historical account and not really expressing the true connection or commonality found within all world scripture. It really seems to miss the point and without it is only a second rate intellectual indulgence into academic understanding of the divine."}, {"userName": "Vince Brown", "userReviewDate": "Jul 31, 2014", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/5763065-vince-brown", "userReview": "Awesome collection of religious writings.

This text includes chapters on the twelve major religious traditions today, plus two chapters on indigenous religious practices.
