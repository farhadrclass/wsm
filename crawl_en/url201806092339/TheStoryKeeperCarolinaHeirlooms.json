So Jen is quite surprised when she finds a manuscript on her desk from it one morning. She has no idea who put it there and, at first, all she can think of is putting it back. That is until she starts to read it and get engrossed in the story about Sarra, a young woman in the Appalachia at the turn of the twentieth century, and Rand a young man that tries to save her from some brutal men. Now she just has to find the rest of the manuscript, but that means traveling to the Blue Ridge Mountains to chase a reclusive author. And, that also means that she is going home for the first time in ten years...The story keeper is book two in the Carolina series and as I already have read book three gave this book some insights to events and mentions in The Sea keeper's Daughters. Part of me wish that I had read the books in order because that would have made me appreciate part of The Sea keeper's Daughters much more, but I can always reread The Sea keeper's Daughters anytime in the future. Do you need to read the books in order? No, but there are some threads that go through the books that make the reading experience perhaps more enjoyable if you read the books in order. But, I started with book 3, The Sea keeper's Daughters, and despite the fact that I hadn't read the previous books in the series did I enjoy that books very much. Actually, I came to love the book very much.This book is good but in my opinion not quite as good as the previous book The Prayer Box or the book that comes after; The Sea keeper's Daughters. For instance, I had a much harder time really warming up the past story that is told in this book parallel to the present story. I for some reason just couldn't bond with Sarra and Rand. I much preferred to read about the present story with Jen trying to meet the author and at the same time confronting her own past when she goes home to meet her sisters and father. There were times I had to put the book down because I got so frustrated with her over religious family where the man's rule is the law. If there is something that makes me angry is men using religion to subdue women.But despite that, I didn't find the past story as enchanting as Jen did has Lisa Wingate manages once again to write a truly wonderful book and the ending almost made me cry."}, {"userName": "Natalie Vellacott", "userReviewDate": "Mar 18, 2016", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/34178791-natalie-vellacott", "userReview": "I received this book free as it was damaged. It contains a story within a story which can attract a wider audience as if you don't like one of the stories you may like the other. I read on the back cover that the author writes for the Christian market but I wouldn't describe this as a Christian book, more contemporary fiction.The main story is about an editor in New York who is sent to the mountain area in which she was raised to investigate a mysterious part manuscript that was left on her desk. The manuscript contains the second story. I did enjoy reading this and it kept my interest but it wasn't a \"stand out\" book. It was a bit slow in places. I was a bit disappointed that more detail wasn't given about the end of the second story which was the more interesting of the two....about a mixed race woman that is rescued from abuse by a man who takes pity on her. The book is clean and free of bad language, violence and sexual content.

Unless you love a book to keep calling to you when you aren't reading. Unless you love characters who are broken but fighting for their place. Unless you love a setting so rich you could see every word. Unless you love a story that resonates. Lisa Wingate is a masterful author and this book is probably my favorite yet. Jen is an editor trying to make it in NYC when a manuscript shows up on her desk. She is entranced by the words and story and must acquire it. The only problem is she has no idea who the author is and going after the book could cost her career. Even more it forces her to return home and confront how broken her family is. This is a rich story within a story, one that flows seemlessly back and forth. It is perfect for readers who love a contemporary with a mystery and almost hidden romance. This is a rich story of family and coming home."}, {"userName": "Ann", "userReviewDate": "Jun 09, 2014", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/2562832-ann", "userReview": "Pick up this book and savor it. Jen has just started her her job as a book rep for a small publisher in New York. She finds an old manuscript submission in her office and wants to publish the book. She identifies with the rural North Carolina setting and sets out to find the author. She goes back to her home town and finds things haven't changed much from when she left years before. While in the area she visits her sister and family who are dirt poor and \"controlled\" by her father, the preacher at the church. She has been sending money every month but it's never enough to help feed all the children. She becomes involved with the family of the writer and learns so valuable insight to her past and future life. A great read and a fantastic story. I like the attention to detail and the historic view of the hills of the south."}, {"userName": "Beth", "userReviewDate": "May 29, 2014", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/4075354-beth", "userReview": "4.5 starsJen Gibbs is a successful non-fiction editor in New York just beginning what could be her dream job at a new publishing house. When a mysterious manuscript shows up on her desk from the infamous, off-limits \u201cslush-pile,\u201d she is weary, but inexplicable drawn to the story therein. A child of Appalachia herself, Jen is compelled by the story of mixed race Sarra, a young Appalachian woman in the early 1900s and travels back to her home to search for the rest of the manuscript. With suspicions of the manuscripts author\u2019s propelling her forward and the past pushing her away, Jen must confront not only the manuscript\u2019s mystery, but her own family troubles that she once thought were behind her forever.It\u2019s not often with a dual storyline that I don\u2019t find myself wishing for the historical aspect to last longer and rush through the contemporary storyline, but that wasn\u2019t the case with The Story Keeper. I loved both sets of characters and both stories. I found Rand\u2019s spiritual questions to be enlightening, and his interactions with Sarra to be both entertaining and poignant. I wanted more of their story, and think that the end of the book could have brought some resolution there. Though there is little left of the manuscript by the time its origin is revealed, I think an epilogue featuring Sarra and Rand would have been a lovely way to end the book. That I was looking for me speaks to how much I enjoyed the historical elements.Jen\u2019s personal journey rang true for me. She comes from a very backward-thinking family, who were oppressive in their belief system and hostile toward anyone who seeks life elsewhere. Her frustrations with her father and sisters and hopes for her youngest sister felt genuine; there was no magic button to make everything better. She had to continuously grow and change in spite of her circumstances. Jen has no control over the decisions that her family has made, or how they respond to her decisions, and she ultimately realizes that their actions aren\u2019t her responsibility. She can keep working through the issues within her power, all the while knowing the ultimate control doesn\u2019t lie in her handsI think one of my favorite themes touched on in the story is how one person can alter another person\u2019s life, and in essence, their story. We are all characters in each other\u2019s stories, whether a passerby or a major player, we all affect each other. Jen\u2019s past and the people there helped mold her into the person she became, even the difficult members of her family and most trying times that she experienced. Wingate\u2019s writing reflects these themes well, and I appreciate that the spiritual aspects were subtly woven throughout the story. I think some points could have been a little more clear-cut, a little more evident, but overall, Jen\u2019s realizations were beautiful There were several elements to this story \u2013 the historical and contemporary storylines, family drama, as well as the mystery of the manuscript. I found myself glad that Wingate didn\u2019t try to sweeten the story by adding an unrealistic romance. While a future relationship was certainly hinted at, in no way did it take over the story. It was nice to read a contemporary story that didn\u2019t fall into that typical pattern. The setting is vivid; Wingate does a great job in using dialogue, tone and word choice as a way of drawing the reader into the Appalachian setting. The descriptions establish a great sense of place, without detracting from the plot. I also loved the details about her job in publishing, I think this behind the scenes look would be fascinating for any bookworm.The Story Keeper manages to delve into both contemporary and historical without one story line taking away from the other. Its themes are universal, yet unique to the story. I will be recommending this one to friends and can see myself buying a copy for my personal library. It is one of those stories that I can see revealing even more value and insight on a second reading. This review first appeared on The Christian Manifesto. I received an advanced copy of this novel for review purposes; the opinions expressed here are my own."}, {"userName": "Andrea Cox", "userReviewDate": "Feb 27, 2015", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/16407549-andrea-cox", "userReview": "by Andrea Renee CoxSometimes a story woos you, dropping a few teasing hints at just the right moments to ensure it captures your heart before wrapping you in a whirlwind or emotion and hope. Novels like these tend to hold on to you long after you\u2019ve placed them back on the shelf.The Story Keeper by Lisa Wingate is one such novel. But it\u2019s also so much more. It squirrels away secrets you desperately want to learn, and as the story unfolds, you find that each piece of the treasure you were searching for might come in different vessels than you originally imagined, which might be the best discovery of all.When a partial manuscript lands mysteriously on Jen Gibbs\u2019s desk, she faces a tough decision: read it and risk her new boss\u2019s wrath or sneak it back onto the legendary Slush Mountain. Either choice could get her fired, but the pull of the story might just be a journey worth the possible loss of employment \u2026 if she can handle the murky shadows of her past. That could prove even more daunting than \u2019fessing up to her boss.The line that stood out the most to me came early on. \u201cIt\u2019s strange how one person and a handful of stories can alter a life.\u201d It\u2019s true of The Story Keeper, but it resonated deeper with me because of another Storyteller.Jesus Christ told \u201ca handful of stories\u201d called parables. Each one shared a piece of His heart and a large dose of the Truth. They aren\u2019t always easily understood, but they impact the lives of those who try to discern the hidden meanings. With these incredible stories, Jesus paved the way for His sacrifice to settle into our hearts. With these stories, He illuminated the way to cross the bridge and be reunited with the Author of our lives.

This is a very well written, interesting book that I would recommend for all readers. Lisa's storyline is actually two books in one. Her characters are strong. I was fortunate to be picked to preview the book. As with all her books, faith is a thread that quietly runs throughout the storyline. The first storyline of Jen and her life runs in the present time and the storyline of Sarra and Rand is from the past, around the turn of the century. She amazes me with her research into the past time period and the history of the peoples of the Appalachian Mountains. I feel as if I have just visited the area from reading her book.

The author definitely did her homework as far as research on the Melungeon people. The story itself is actually two stories, one the tale of main character Jen's life at a publishing house, a career she chose after bravely breaking free of the cult-like Brethren Saints, a religious group her family belongs to in Appalachia. The other story, titled The Story Keeper, is a partial manuscript that mysteriously appears on her desk one day. She is immediately drawn in by it, believing she knows who the mystery author is, and she convinces her boss to let her visit Appalachia to seek him out. From there the story branches into numerous sub-plots: Jen's search for the reclusive author, her apprehension at returning home after many years away, the bizarre family dynamic that she hates. As thing progress a few other more minor sub-plots pop up: a young girl who reminds Jen of herself, the mystery writer's family dynamics \u2013 including his alcoholic brother who neglects his young daughter, and so on. As I was reading I found it all a little overwhelming at times, and I wondered as the end neared how on Earth it was all going to come together to a logical conclusion. The story seemed to end abruptly, leaving many things unanswered, and I was disappointed, wanting more. I went into reading the epilogue with serious doubts that it would satisfy me. It did, and it didn't \u2013 but that's a good thing, and here's why: All the loose ends that had so bothered me were tied up quickly and cleanly, but in such a way that was completely believable. Questions were answered, conclusions alluded to, ideas presented about what things might be happening under the surface too. The ending both satisfied me, in an okay-I-can-see-that kind of way, and left me longing for more. A future was alluded to that I wanted to know more about.All in all another great story from a talented storyteller"}, {"userName": "Staci", "userReviewDate": "Sep 03, 2014", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/11909124-staci", "userReview": "The Story Keeper was primarily about current day characters Jennia Beth and Evan. Jennia Beth was born and raised in Appalachia and was thankful to have escaped when she was 18 years old. Evan is a reclusive successful author.A secondary story is about Rand and Sarra that lived in Appalachia many years ago.It was an enjoyable story and one I'd recommend to those that enjoy contemporary fiction with a bit of history woven in.In this same series is The Prayer Box. The two novels are similar in some ways as they share geography (Carolinas) and parallel story lines with both past and present. In other ways, the two novels are very different. The main character in The Prayer Box most definitely doesn't have her life together while Jennia Beth has a successful career. That particular distinguishing factor made the two novels pretty different. Survival (The Prayer Box) vs. Peace of Mind (The Story Keeper).

Turning the pages, Jen finds herself drawn into the life of Sarra, a mixed-race Melungeon girl trapped by dangerous men in the turn of the century Appalachia.

This series too involves looking back in the past to explain things of the present and I enjoyed this first book in this series very much. The storyline is intricate and involves several parallel threads which are all very interesting: First, Jen's attempts to connect with Evan to determine if he is the author of the mysterious story that appeared unfinished on her publishing desk. Second, the story itself of Sarra and Rand. Finally, the story of Jen's family that is difficult and painful. Wingate did an excellent job of intertwining these three storylines without making it hard for me to follow each one. I found the information about the Melungeons very interesting as this was something I had never heard of previously. The author's research on this subject was obviously done well. I also enjoyed learning more about the setting of Appalachia knowing that in some areas it is quite different from the rest of the United States with its isolated families, poverty, and sometimes backwardness. The story is captivating and this is definitely a read I would highly recommend. Although it is part of a series, I did not have any trouble reading it as a stand alone.FAVORITE QUOTES: \"A man who doesn't stand for what is right dies his own death well before it happens.\"\"Remember that no matter how many wrong choices we've made in the past, we can always decide to make the right ones today.\"\"..the truth came upon him quite clearly. Indeed, faith was not a matter of routines and external trappings.

I love Lisa Wingate's books for the most part and there was no doubt this story kept me engaged. I liked Jen and the mystery that the slush pile manuscript pushed her into was great. I liked the story of Rand and Sarra intermixed with Jen's story. But I thought that the ending was rushed and not fully completed. You only get a vague idea of what happens to Rand and Sarra and you don't get a lot of romance development between Jen and Evan. And I like romance! :DAnd then there was Jen's (Jennia Beth) family. Wow! That kind of cult religion is so very, very sad! That is NOT what Christianity is all about. It just hurts your heart to think people are treated and live that way. Definitely a sad note to the book. All in all though, this was a good story with a delightful mystery and some family drama that will bring tears to your eyes.This is the 2nd book in the Carolina series but it can be read as a stand alone.

I absolutely LOVE LOVE LOVE this wise and wonderful novel that toggles between the Big Apple and Appalachia, contemporary and historical, drama and mystery, and everything wonderful that makes a story great. All saturated with rich elements of family dynamics, friendship, love, loss, self-introspection, cultural reflections, the world of publishing, obsessions, passions, and life lessons. \"Our stories are powerful. They teach, they speak, they inspire. They bring about change. But they are also fragile. Their threads are so easily broken by time, by lack of interest, by failure to understand the value that comes of knowing where we have been and who we have been. In this speed of light culture our histories are fading more quickly than ever . . . when we lose our stories, we lose ourselves . . . .\" Once again, as with The Prayer Box, but in different ways, Lisa Wingate has touched my heart, soul, and mind with her beautifully-rich gift of storytelling. For indeed, it is a treasured gift to be able to read a story that moves me to sit long and ponder, to discover new cultures or ideas or treasures. And to look at my life and the lives of others through a more passionate light, a softer light, a far more forgiving light. \"It's so easy to make assumptions, passing by other people's homes at a distance. To be certain that the goings-on inside mirrors the exteriors - that glittering facades and squeaky-clean windows equate to perfect families, yet the reality is that containers often tell nothing of the contents.\" Wingate truly has a surreal sense of what it means to be human; the good, the bad, the ugly, and the downright absurdity of what it means to be an imperfect person living in an imperfect world. However, \"The Story Keeper\" is as much about place as it is people, for it's place and sense of belonging that helps shape and mold each of us.Paired with Wingate's compassionate revelations regarding humanity, and her gifted storytelling in which people, places, and things come alive, are brilliant snatches of random humor:\"These silly wireless phones. I can't hear worth a flip on them . . . That's what happens when you get old. Can't heart, can't see, and your boobs sag. It's not for the faint of heart.\" I will mention, for grammar sticklers, Wingate often invokes creative-liberty when it comes to writing formalities and rules. And within the historical portions of this story, Wingate's fairly heavy-handed with Appalachian-speak. For me, it wasn't a problem. I was born and raised in Oklahoma, and lived in the Blue Ridge Mountains of WNC for fourteen years. Southern drawl and mountain-speak warms my soul like old home-week. But for those unfamiliar with southern-fried dialect, just take it nice and easy through the historical story within the contemporary story. It's too beautiful to miss a single word.All the way around (contemporary and historical, drama and mystery, Christian and secular) FIVE TOP-PICK STARS."}, {"userName": "Judy Collins", "userReviewDate": "Jul 08, 2014", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/11063006-judy-collins", "userReview": "Master storyteller, Lisa Wingate returns with the continuation of her inspiring series with THE STORY KEEPER,  (#2 Carolinas), as New York editor, Jen Gibbs uncovers a mysterious manuscript over twenty years old written by an unknown author, leading her back to the heart of the Blue Ridge Mountains of NC, a place she thought she would never return. Having read all the books  in the series, set in North Carolina, from east to west, Wingate crafts a compelling read\u2014a spellbinding story of generations, combining the past and present of two different stories, for questions answered with comfort and hope, a journey, an experience, the glory hours! Jen Gibbs is getting on  with her life, with her nice job as an editor for a New York publishing house, after overcoming her dysfunctional family. When a manuscript over twenty years old turns up with no author, she is intrigued. She becomes immersed in the story of Sarra, a mixed-race Melungeon girl trapped in the dangerous turn-of-the-century Appalachia. From time travel to undeniable pain, despair, prejudice and bigotry, love, sisters, family, and acceptance. (Melungeon is a term traditionally applied to one of numerous \"tri-racial isolate\" groups of the Southeastern US. Historically, Melungeons were associated with the Cumberland Gap area of central Appalachia, which includes portions of East Tennessee, Southwest Virginia, and eastern Kentucky).There are two stories,  both which will grab you from Sarra\u2019s story and Jen\u2019s. What makes it very dramatic is Jen\u2019s history as for how she relates to the past.

The Story Keeper can be read as a standalone; however, I would recommend reading the entire series, beautiful and powerful! \"The thing which underlines the best stories \u2013 HOPE!\"  JDCMustReadBooks"}, {"userName": "Laura", "userReviewDate": "Aug 25, 2014", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/2521894-laura", "userReview": "Title: THE STORY KEEPERAuthor: Lisa WingatePublisher: TyndaleAugust 2014ISBN: 978-1414386898Genre: Women\u2019s fiction\u201cShe\u2019d noticed immediately that I understood the lure of a good story. Sometimes a world that doesn\u2019t exist is the only escape from one that does.\u201d Successful New York editor, Jen Gibbs, is at the top of her game with her new position at Vida House Publishing -- until a mysterious manuscript from an old slush pile appears on her desk. Turning the pages, Jen finds herself drawn into the life of Sarra, a mixed-race Melungeon girl trapped by dangerous men in the turn of the century Appalachia. A risky hunch may lead to The Story Keeper's hidden origins and its unknown author, but when the trail turns toward the heart of the Blue Ridge Mountains, a place Jen thought she'd left behind forever, the price of a blockbuster next book deal may be higher than she's willing to pay. THE STORY KEEPER is pure Lisa Wingate. Within pages of starting the book I was fully connected with Jen\u2014and then when she started reading the old slush pile manuscript, I couldn\u2019t help but feel for Sarra. My daughter, reading over my shoulder while I waited in line somewhere, commented, there\u2019s a lot of bad grammar in this book. I told her that Ms. Wingate writes the way the character talks, thinks. Pure point of view. Both storylines are written in first person, which doesn\u2019t bother me but may detour some readers. If you like women\u2019s fiction, you will absolutely love THE STORY KEEPER. Highly recommended. 449 pages.

I was mesmerized by the setting, the story, and the characters. The characters in the contemporary setting are Jen Gibbs and Evan Hall. Jen has just landed her dream job working for Vida Publishing in New York City. Evan is a successful author. Both Jen and Evan are from Appalachian mountain communities in North Carolina. Jen is captivated by a manuscript that mysteriously shows up on her desk during her first week of work at Vida Publishing. Within the manuscript is the fascinating story of Rand and Sarra near the turn of the 20th century in the Blue Ridge Mountains. Rand is spending time away from Charleston studying in the Appalachians and Sarra is an intriguing young girl of mixed ethnicity. She is the victim of an abusive father but has a rich history of being loved and taught by her grandparents at a younger age. She keeps this heritage in her heart through unpleasant and trying times.Both story lines are captivating and the entire book is such a beautiful pleasure to read. I\u2019m just amazed at the excellence of the storytelling and had difficulty putting the book down. I\u2019m certain this book will remain a lifetime favorite for me.I received a copy of this book from the publisher, through The Book Club Network (bookfun.org) in exchange for my honest review."}, {"userName": "Judy", "userReviewDate": "Aug 21, 2014", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/1871221-judy", "userReview": "The Story Keeper by Lisa WingateJennia Beth Gibbs left her home in the North Carolina mountains to the streets of New York City without looking back.

She finds herself heading back to the one place she never wanted to go.

But her new job depends on his cooperation.The story includes a secondary story, Rand and Sarra\u2019s. I love the way this author writes. It\u2019s more than a story, it\u2019s a tale of the way people live in the mountains. Their knowledge of nature, roots, herbs, etc. Kin helping kin. And in Sarra\u2019s story...prejudice.

Lisa then takes the story character and the reader on a journey to establish a practical application of that redemptive quality. Towards the end of the story, I was silently telling the sisters, \"No! Don't do it!\", however, their decisions brought freedom and breakthrough on multiple levels. Most of Lisa Wingate's books point the way for women who have experienced tough life issues. For those who haven't gone through tough times, the story is still a very interesting read. At times I literally found myself sitting on the edge of the chair in anticipation. Family, career, love, mystery, the Appalachian Mountains; a well woven tapestry. On one hand I wanted to speed through the book to find out what would happen next, on the other hand I didn't want it to end, so tried to force myself to slow down. I will definitely re-read this book."}, {"userName": "Karen", "userReviewDate": "Apr 19, 2014", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/5085676-karen", "userReview": "I was so excited to be selected to read a pre-publication of Lisa Windgate's book the Story Keeper with the Sisterhood of the Traveling Book.

As I read page after page I could visualize each scene. I would love to dig into that slush-pile and read till my heart's content! Right after Jen begins a new job with a top publisher in New York City an old manuscript appears on her desk. Knowing this came from the slush-pile that everyone is warned not to touch she isn't sure what to do at first but curiosity overcomes and she reads it which leads her into an exciting but sometimes frustrating search for the author and right back to the place she never wanted to return. Difficult subjects are handled, we meet Jen's annoying (sometimes maddening) family and of course the author of the manuscript. Amazing story, superbly written.
