It was, once again, intense, thrilling, and each even was completely unexpected. I love that I couldn't predict how the plot would twist and that I had fun trying to figure out when the IMA would strike again.Michael was amazing. Obviously. In this book, we get to see a more vulnerable side to him and how fiercely protective he is of Christina. The author did a fantastic job of bringing his character to life.As for Christina... I bet you're wondering if my opinion of her has improved...Sorry to disappoint, but my opinion of her took a nosedive. Any positive ground she may have gained with me was lost in this book. She was honestly borderline TSTL, judgmental, rude, selfish, inconsiderate, and I wasn't impressed. At all.So now I'm off to continue the story in book 3 for more action, thrills, suspense, and Michael.XO"}, {"userName": "Daiane", "userReviewDate": "Jun 28, 2015", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/32806732-daiane", "userReview": "He was a bad man, and I knew that, but a part of me was starting not to care. And the part of me that did care was quickly becoming a liar.This book...It was addictive. it's mean and good and bad. Although the book started slow (and seriously, I couldn't care less about the beginning), I really liked how it was focused more on espionage and, of course, feelings. Such a strange woman, to see beauty in a deathtrap and goodness in a killer. Christina is still whining like hell, but she is getting better. She made some huge bad choices and screw up a lot. However, I can't even imagine how I would feel if I was in her situation so I should judge less.Michael is still the same asshole. And I don't think he will change. And I like it.\u201cI'm not going to force you into anything you don't want. But I'm also not going to take a vow of chastity and pine away for you, or whatever the hell it is that men do in romance novels these days.\u201d As always, he is not the usual \"romance guy\" who changes for her. Okay that he is tiring sometimes. His presence is so strong that can be too much. But it also makes the book different. And he grew on me. I also have to say that Nenia's head is awesome to write this. The way she alternates between Christine and Michael is amazing!

This series is kick-ass, seriously. I never imagined I'd love it so much. The second time around is even sweeter than the first!Christina is moving on with her life and trying to forget about the IMA and Michael. She's confused about her feelings and can't seem to stop thinking about him. A year later.But her past won't stay in the past and she soon finds out that her independence and security is only an illusion.Michael thought he was doing the right thing by walking away from Christina and the IMA. He thought he was protecting her. Boy, was he ever wrong. A rat has sold him out and he finds himself on Christina's doorstep. Unconscious.This book didn't have as much action and running from the bad guys as the first one. It had a lot more intrigue, more espionage, more meat. It also had a bigger emphasis on the relationship between Christina and Michael. WHICH I LOVED.It had me on the edge of my seat once again and I literally couldn't put it down. Read it in one day. The best thing about our main characters is their genuity. They are so believable. Each one trying to protect their heart at the risk of letting the other in.More so for Christina, because she has had quite the experience at the hands of the IMA and Michael. She fights her feelings till the last third when even I as a reader had melted into a puddle at Michael's feet. He was very mercurial. One minute being an asshole, the next saying things that brought happy tears to my eyes.His problem is this is so new to him. He's never felt that way or had his vulnerability come to the forefront. He feels helpless, alone, at the mercy of his heart to a young woman who could easily hate him. He knows he's not good enough, he knows his limits on what he could offer. But he also loves her with a ferocity that can't be ignored.I FELL IN LOVE WITH MICHAEL.This story is also quite intricate and suspenseful. It keeps you guessing till the end where I was shocked! But the best thing came at the last few pages. I've been dreaming of that and it made me thirst for more for Michael and Christina. The man says things and proves them so disarmingly, I was speechless.LOVE, LOVE THIS SERIES! Absolutely cannot wait for LOCKED AND LOADED.

The ending was such a tease! It was a tiny taste of what's to come. All the anticipation and sexual tension almost drove me insane. It was building, bubbling and boiling!!! And I just got a tiny taste of it... GAHHHH I really loved how the characters stayed true to themselves in this book. Yes they have changed, but definitely for the better! The biggest change I saw was definitely in Christina. I found her frustrating and childish at times, but I always forget how young she really is. She's mature in a lot of ways, but there's still a part of her that was childish. As the book progresses though, you can definitely see Christina maturing. She's becoming a strong woman. She's sticking up for herself and finally accepting her feelings for Michael.Now, Now...Michael...He's so hard to hate. Yes he's a dangerous man...Yes he's an assassin...Yes he's done a lot of bad things...BUT he's changing for Christina... He truly deserves a second chance. I really loved how he did not become the sappy romantic guy. He's still got his edge, sarcasm and ruggedness. That's what makes him Michael and not anybody else.Favorite quotes\"I was going to assume you liked eating babies and sacrificing virgins, but I might as well ask, what do you do for fun?\"\"I languish in sin,\" I replied in the same tone. \"I take my babies rare, and my virgins over easy.\"\"I fucking love you, you know,\" he said. \"You made my life complicated as fuck, and I could care less.\"I can't wait for the 3rd book Locked and Loaded!

Starts pretty much where it left off in Cloak and Dagger, Christine back at home with her narcissistic mother. Her parents have divorced and she is working to move on from her kiddnapping and confused feeling for Michael. Talking with Doctors are a waste.... How can you talk about being captured, almost killed and the organization that tired to make it all happen?Nope, Christine feels isolated. She decides to go to a collage with a low profile and try to move forward some how.While Christine is working to find some new kind of normal, Michael, our assassin, hitman turn lovesick for Christine, is held to the promise he made to IMA. He has promise to \"work\" with them in order to keep Christine safe from the \"evils\" out there.There are chases, escapes from tight situations, bombs and international intrigue. All kinds of action. What struck me most with this book was more of the personal and interpersonal revelations of the characters. Christine discovers her own voice and capabilitiies. Michael continues to discover he has a heart and what real feelings are. All of this is done with the Nenia's vision of how she sees things through the character's thoughts. Those who know me on GR know I am not shy in my love of writing that moves me. It was the suprising nuggets of phrasing and concepts of real questions that hit me as I read this book. Is it a heavy handed book, no. But it does present a lot of questions with answers which made me think.There is, of course, the budding romance between Christine and Michael. What will be interesting is the next part of this series and where it takes them.

Then I came the realization that there are two more books (I believe) in the series, and I could breathe easy, HALLELUJAH.This was a speedy read for me, I zipped right through it, and I was into the story, like full on engrossed, from start to finish. I don't know if anyone else does this, but while reading I'm continuously checking the table of contents to work out how many more chapters I have left; I did not do this once for Armed and Dangerous (nor did I do this while reading Cloak and Dagger). Perhaps my favourite thing about these books (thus far) is that they are very fast-paced: Something is always happening. OK, wait a minute. I lied. My favourite thing is Christina. Wait. Maybe it's Michael. Shit. Everything about this book is my favourite ok. Anyway. Back to Christina. Throughout the course of this story we were able to see her mature, and I've mentioned this so many times I'm probably sounding like a broken record, but my favourite part about reading is following characters and being able to watch them grow.

I really liked this book more than the first one. There is everything- action (lots of it), passion (not enough of it), conspiracy, danger and most importantly a sexy guy who will do everything to protect the woman he loves. The book starts a little bit slow. Christina still deals with her awful mother, goes to college, and tries to forget the man who almost destroyed her a year ago. She tries to live a normal life. But soon she realises that you can\u2019t escape the IMA. They are everywhere and her chances for survival are really low. That\u2019s it before she got a special delivery- a hot unconscious assassin. Michael does everything in his power to protect Christina. He goes back to work for the IMA only because of her- so she can be safe. \n\u201cI\u2019m making you a promise. Touch her and die.\u201d\nBut then he wakes up in her apartment and the action begins. Michael and Christina are together against two organisations that want to kill them! To survive would be quite hard!!!Their relationship is much different from the first book.

Another follow up that is full of suspense, humorous banter, heart felt moments and satisfying ending. After the event that unfold at the end of Cloak and Dagger, Christina and Michael have both went on their own merry way. Christina is now heading to college in Arizona, somewhere as remotely as she can find to hide herself away from any imminent danger. She tried to lead a normal student life, but she's a change person after her ordeal with the IMA.If one more person told me how lucky I was to be alive and unharmed, how lucky I was to be safe, I thought I might punch them.Her hopeless parent aren't much help either. Once again, her mum sprout some twisted wisdom that kind of make sense sometimes. I guess I will miss her presence.\"In today's economy, people do not want to buy fashion. They want to buy sob stories that will make them feel better about their own miserable lives.\"Meanwhile, Michael had been engaging with a cat and mouse game with the sadistic Adrian Callaghan. Poor Michael. He had all my sympathy this time around. The miserable life that he is leading currently is kind of pathetic. He reminds me so much of Michael Westen in Burn Notice. The guy who got cornered by the pseudo-government agency, but was not killed due to his valuable skill set. Michael Westen got threaten with his family safety. Michael Boutilier got threaten with Christina safety. Yeah, it sucks when you got attached to something. It took a pretty long time for Christina and Michael to finally be reunited. But I was not bored with the things that took place prior to that moment. I was mostly anxious and keep wondering how will they end up together again. I had a fucking standing ovation going on in my goddamn pants, and it was demanding an encore. But the leading lady, she was nowhere in sight.When they finally did, things was not lovey dovey as I hope. There is definitely no lost love there. Christina hated his guts, wondering why is he showing up to ruin her life again. On Michael's part, he hates the fact that she hates him. Despite the animosity, they both agree to stick together and make things work against the IMA and BN (another rival group to IMA). Adrian has been taking a backseat here and killing Michael is not in his immediate plan. He just live to make his life miserable. Right now, Michael had a threat from another source instead. Who is this weasel that sold him out and left him to the wolves?Christina had changed so much from the naive girl from Book 1. Now her world is no longer black and white as she would prefer. She had to wrestle with her conscience to survive. I wonder how she would turn out at the end. Will her beautiful soul still remain intact? And what about her feelings for Michael. She hates him. But yet she don't. Is freaking complicated. She just can't seem to trust him 100%. There were many times that I literally wanted to shout at her 'just give in to the poor guy already'!\"Sometimes they realize the grass really is greener on the other side.\"\"Is that what happened to you?\"\"Me, I found out both sides were nothing but shit - \"Michael POV never fail to entertain me. His view of life is always jaded and cynical. He hates the world at large. I don't blame him for the shit he had went through. Is a wonder he isn't dead yet for the countless time he was hunted and sold out over and over again.Forcing an old house to service the grade of technology we use is a bit like hiring a seventy-year-old hooker for trying out new sex positions.Michael appear wild and volatile or at times like a kid on sugar high. No wonder Christina is afraid of him. His only motivation now is to keep her alive. Woah! He is pining for her real bad. Only to find that, if looks could kill, she had kill him many times over. Well, he did try to charm his way back to her good grace, but when you are trained professionally to lie, is hard to make people believe in you. \"I can keep you safe. You won't come to any harm under my protection.\"\"You and safe don't belong in the same sentence.\"As opposed to the confrontational scene that took place in Book 1, this time they took a more passive stance and mostly on the run. The turn of event that happen near the end kind of threw me off balance. Wow! I can't wait to see what can Christina do, and will she be as badass as Michael? The ending itself finally sweetened the pot for me, all I can say is 'its about damn time'! \"You made my life complicated as fuck, and I could care less.\""}, {"userName": "Fani *loves angst*", "userReviewDate": "Oct 28, 2013", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/1133802-fani-loves-angst", "userReview": "Could be even better than the first, if only they'd met sooner.

What a way to end a book. Holy fuck...Okay pre-warnings, this is a second to a series if you stumbled upon this and thought it looked interesting, this review will have spoilers from the first book most likely, but not from this one. So with that all said and done i will start my review....Song choice: \"I Can't Make You Love Me\" (cover) by Bon Iver, and \"Speechless\" by Lady Gaga (yeah that is right i like Lady Gaga get over it, she has an amazing voice, and this is an amazing song. Both dealing with the relationship between Michael and Christina. First thoughts: When i read the summary i thought that honestly Michael would still be the same, and Christina would have turned out into this total like i am going to kill everybody...now that might be a good theme song for Michael the song is by skrillex...hehe anyways...i will talk more about that in characters. Though this book wasn't emotionally taxing in the same way as the first one this one still had very raw emotions. Had moments that i felt hopeless, but not completely as i did in the first one. Plot: I thought that Michael and Christina would be reunited almost within the first few chapters, but when that didn't happen i start to grow comfortable in their routines which i thought worked well for the story, it gave you the same sense as the characters were going through. Though i will admit Adrian annoyed me in this one only because i felt like all of his threats were ideal, he threatened Michael with Christina a lot but never did anything about it. I didn't really feel that sense of urgency. There were two scenes that i was slightly confused on the positioning, and actions of the characters, i wasn't sure how they were tied up, not sexually of course ;). anyways there was someone, or many someones out to get these two, so continuing their partnership from the last book these two will fight to the point you want to slap them both, and get along to the point that will make you swoon. Characters:First off i love these characters. so much. they were amazingly written and totally just awesome. i will explain why individually in a moment. Christina: Now like i mentioned in my first thoughts that i thought that when i start this she might have turned into the feminine version of Chuck Norris, or James Bond, or i don't know Jet Lee. I thought that she would have gone crazy with learning how to protect herself, and using guns and all that but the thing is that wouldn't have been her. She was always a sweet, Christian girl who doesn't believe in violence so honestly i am glad that she wasn't. Not only that but she managed to keep her head above water as well as react like i would expect someone in her situation would. She is scared, she is paranoid but thank god she finally stands up to her mother, who is a crazy bitch by the way. I really like how she was in the book she because she does grow, she does start becoming her own individual person. She is brave, caring, and she is trying her best. In the last book she annoyed me sometimes because she stated the obvious a lot and asked really in my opinion stupid questions only because i knew she wouldn't get an answer, and that was downsized in this. And i could see her giving Michael a chance.Michael: Wow. Well in the first book i was super on the fence about him. He was an asshole, and he was hard to care about. And he promised not to be that \"bad boy\" that will automatically change just because he found a girl that he is in love with. And though when he is with Christina in this book i can see subtle changes within him he doesn't change who he is really. He still makes crude remarks, he still loves the swearing, which i don't mind so don't think i am complaining cause i am not. But i can see that he REALLY, in his own strange twisted way cares about her. AND OH GOD he is like...wow. he said the most...wow things ever. like oh my goodness. But before i do quotes and i have to because they are amazing! he is still BA and he still willing to kill to protect Christina. so quotes! \u201cSoft, warm, alive. Beautiful. Brave.\u201d His head shifted, tilting so he could look at me. \u201cWhen I think about it I'd do almost anything to keep you breathing. So I try not to. You are my beating heart, Christina Parker. I wasn't truly living until I met you, and if you were to slit my throat right now I wouldn't lift a finger to stop you, and I'd die a better man because of it.\u201d \u201cNo. And I made that choice. I let all that anger and pain get twisted up in my thoughts for you.\u201d He leaned in. \u201cIt fucking kills me. Every night. I relive what I did to you every night.\u201d His forehead rested against mine. \u201cUntil you,\u201d he said softly, \u201cI never felt truly helpless.\u201d\"I wanted her to be safe. I wanted her to be mine. I wanted to have my cake and eat it, too.\"one more cause i cannot resist\u201cI need you alive.

We are watching you. And if we want to, we can hurt you.\"At the beginning of this book we see Christina starting on a new page, trying to move on with her life. There's no IMA or Michael to distract or bother her. She enrolls in College and her life seems to be moving along like a regular teenage girl until she is abruptly thrust back into the world of danger, hiding, fearing for her life, and of course Michael B. These two have the most complicated relationship I have ever read about. One minute they on, the next they're off. One minute they hot, then they're cold. Most of this relationship back and forth is due to Christina's inability to trust Michael and I do agree with her reluctance, he certainly has alot to make up for. Its refreshing to read of a heroine who's not happy to forgive, forget, and live happily ever after and act like crazy shit didn't happen. \"He had his fingers on the trigger of my heart.\" So once again this Bonnie and Clyde duo are on the run not only from the IMA but another organization who is not to be messed with. Somehow they just keep making enemies. Its quite adorable that Michael freely admitted his feelings to Christina and he did not try to help them. \"You are my beating heart Christina Parker.\" Christina is less annoying and whiny this book. I've witnessed the growth thats taken place with her character, and I'm happy that she's finally coming into her own.I love Nenia Campbell's writing. Her one liners and certain phrases were laugh out loud funny. \"Isn't it beautful?\" she whisphered. My cock bobbed in agreement. Yes, she was.\" Even though there was not as much blood shed and action like the first book, I like the fact that this book focusses alot more on the dynamic between Christina and Michael, and how they basically just have each other to rely on. Love this series! Love this author! I can't wait for book three.\"Emotions get people killed.

Better because Cristina is no longer a hostage, she suddenly has a say on many things. An improvement because the author doesn't sugar coat her relationship with Michael or make her romanticize him in ridiculous ways. I still don't know how I feel about them being together, I'm really torn up about it, about just as much as Cristina is herself. I sort of liked Michael this time around but its those kind of likes that make you shake your head at yourself and think there is something fundamentally wrong with your head. XDD But this entire series is written to fuck with your brain while at the same time trying to keep us moderately sane through Cristina. Shit is going to go down and bad things are going to happen. So remember, Michael is a bad man, except when he is not. Killing is wrong, except when its not. And feelings are fucked up all the time."}, {"userName": "Huniya", "userReviewDate": "Jan 17, 2015", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/10117674-huniya", "userReview": "Actual rating - 3.5 Not without its flaws.

LOVE HER!!! I also love her characters. they are not cliche. they are refreshing and strong. and i love her heroines. it's really nice to see that the main girl just doesn't just sread her legs because the guy is just too damn hot. i was getting TIRED of pathetic and desperate heroines. LOVE YOU nenia for that. anyway, Armed and Dangerous. it starts of two years after the event of Cloak and Dagger. after the love confession and whole IMA disaster. Michael disappeared from Christina's life. left her a note and just whoosh...nothing after that. Christina is moving on although she tries her best not to remember Michael. but he is there...always. she came to realize that a part of her will always remember Michael. Her mother is still a bitch...as usual. she moves to Arizona, started going to college and try to blend in. well it ain't gonna be that easy, now will it? IMA gets a hold of her and threatens her and that's back to square one but this time she alone and Michael isn't there to help her. despite all that she still deals with it and goes on.Michael on the other hand is busy playing double agent. The IMA sends him to england to another organization just as dangerous to be a spy. he is expected to give IMA information. but MIchael also has his own dilemma. he can't seem to forget the girl that was once his captive, that broke down his walls and showed him light. he craves her, wants her and want to make it right. that can't happen. he is not fit for that. his life can't include love and a girl. too complicated. but that doesn't stop him from fantasizing about the feisty girl who stole his heart. michael gets in trouble. one of the people from BN figures out he is a spy and that person also knows about Christina. so Michael gets a severe whack and gets send to one person he never in a million years thought would see...Christina. they just dumps Michael right into Christina's lap. Christina is completely flabbergasted and shocked. she sees the man that doesn't leave her thoughts and the man she didn't see for two years. despite the things that went down between him and christina, she decides to help the half beaten to death, drugged Michael. the Story starts...Michael is also shocked to see Christina but as we all know, he recovers pretty quickly. he goes back to the old Michael. he teases her, makes her uncomfortable and not to mention, the whole love confession that never was discussed properly. things are tensed and complicated between them. the sexual tension all time high. but danger lurks. they know that IMA will get a hold of them pretty quickly so they go on a run. she hates it, her emotions and feelings for this man is all over the place. i loved her in this book. she transformed into this strong and independent woman. she knew she felt things for michael but she held her grounds. she didn't just fall on her back and spread her legs. she made him work for it. i understood her conflict. she couldn't understand if it was right or wrong to have feelings for someone who did horrible things to you once. I also loved glimpse of her jealously a little. she was scared that Michael wasn't gonna wait for her forever. she wanted him to. she denied her attraction and feelings for him but even she knew it was there and it wasn't gonna go away.Christina \"On the same token, I didn't want him to follow through on what he said before, about not wantingto wait around forever for me to make a decision. I didn't want him to find another girl. Just thethought of him with another woman made me feel queasy.\" Michael was trying to be the better man and make it right but he was still the same man, not towards her bu the still could kill without thinking twice. he gave Christina choice. he wanted her to willingly come to him and be with him. he really did changed a lot in this book. the softer,gentler and caring side was just as sexy as his dark, cruel and merciless side. he tried so hard not to give into taking Christina. he wanted her to know that it was her choice. he protected her and put her before his own life. Michael they were also stubborn as hell. jesus lord you two, just get it on. michael WANTED Christina. getting into his head and learn how much he wanted her was just a turn on (he can have me any day. no complaints) his feelings grew in the process. he showed her that he was a better man and he'd protect her no matter what. their journey was amazing, bitter, sweet, sexy and a lot of discovery. they were entwined with each other without them knowing. I LOVED IT. Michael and Christina all the way. their sexual chemistry was off the chart and i loved the stolen moments. i loved the when they finally had sex. it was a complete 360 from the from the first book and it was HOT!!!I CAN'T WAIT FOR \"LOCKED AND LOADED\" SO EXCITED!!! thank you Nenia for writing such an amazing series.release the third book SOON. I AM EAGER.MORE MICHAEL AND CHRISTINA"}, {"userName": "Rashika (is tired)", "userReviewDate": "Dec 15, 2013", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/8492956-rashika-is-tired", "userReview": "Actual Rating 3.5(I've actually had this review written up for a while and kept on forgetting to post it.. oops)This sequel fell short of the first book. I wouldn\u2019t say it suffered from the second book syndrome but it just didn\u2019t hit the same mark as the first book. It was entertaining but it could have been more. I think one of my biggest problems with this book was Christina. It\u2019s almost as if the last book never happened. They are back to square one where she refuses to trust Michael. I know that getting over what happened is hard, I\u2019d be pissed if she got over it so quickly, but there needs to be some room to maneuver. She doesn\u2019t leave much room. It\u2019s hard with this book because sometimes she\u2019d say something that makes you hope that some character development has occurred but then she\u2019d be back to questioning Michael. She realizes that you don\u2019t always have a choice but then she goes ahead and decides to question Michael. He does know what he\u2019s doing. He is an assassin who worked for the agency that is hunting them down. He knows his shit. Maybe she should listen to him for once. The problem here is that there hasn\u2019t been much character development on Christina\u2019s end. She is almost exactly like what she was in the previous book and it bothers me. My biggest issue with Michael was actually minor. I didn\u2019t like his his reason for falling in love with Christina. A little too cliched for my liking. And perhaps I expected slightly more from him since he is rather badass. Aside from that, I really admire his patience with Christina, I would NOT have been able to keep my cool around her.One of my other issues with this book were the bad parents. They stuck out a lot more to me this time around. Perhaps because in the first book I still held on to the hope that there would be some sort of redemption for them. Bad parents always bother me in books. Perhaps because it is such an overused cliche. Yes not all parents are perfect but for the most part they won\u2019t go out of their way to ruin their child\u2019s life. Even when they are controlling. The plot was well paced and I had loads of fun watching Michael mess around with everyone. Of course, I also liked how he could be outsmarted. The plot and Michael were ultimately the saving grace of this book because if nothing else, you can always count on Nenia to present you with a highly entertaining story which will keep you on the edge. Even with all my issues with this book, I cannot wait to read the (no longer the last!! :D) 3rd book in the series. I am counting on it for being the best out of the 3. With Christina finally opening up and the two of them combining brain power to kick some IMA ass."}, {"userName": "Sam", "userReviewDate": "Mar 17, 2014", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/9111390-sam", "userReview": "Okay, as soon as I finished reading Cloak and Dagger, I contemplated taking a break to start Fearscape (really wanna read Fearscape, lol) but I just had to find out what happened next in the IMA series! The blurb of this one had me eager to keep going! Okay, so this one starts with Christina trying to move on with her life, and Michael (separately) doing the same.This book was quite a bit different than the first. There was a little less action to start, but that picked up toward the end. Some things made me mad (Christina's mom), some things made me sad (spoiler, can't say, but you'll see), some things made me annoyed (often Christina, lol), and some things totally surprised me (the end)! I enjoyed the way Michael was reintroduced into her life--let's face it, she was totally bored without him. ;) I felt like the time when Christina was just starting college and the desert trek went on for quite a while. I'm also curious as to what happened with her mother's book. Christina still annoyed me sometimes, like being a ninny about Michael killing someone who was planning to kill her. COME ON, Christina. Times like these I wanted to give her survival-instinct-steroids.Often, I didn\u2019t really get the feeling she even liked Michael. She spent so much time hating him and thinking of him as a bastard, and even on the odd moment that she liked him instead, I didn\u2019t fully believe her. I guess we'll see how this develops in the next book!The ending had me excited! I'm tempted to start the next one again, but...I refuse to do it this time!

I like it when the psychology of a character is consistent, and despite a couple of spots, this book did a pretty good job of keeping Michael and Christina true to themselves. The first book, I couldn't even finish it. I read about halfway in, and I couldn't take the abusive relationship between Michael and a captive Christina. I skimmed the rest, so I got the gist of the plot, and then read the very end. But then something surprising happened. I couldnt stop thinking about the characters, and I was waiting desperately for this book to come out. Strange. I know. I guess I just really love transformative/redemptive love stories. In this book I could start to see that Michael didn't just lust after Christina. He really was changed by his feelings for her. Love? Right? In turn, Christina is becoming an adult and coming into her own. (I suppose this will really play out in the third book.)
