Since I've read one of the author's books before, I decided to read this one as well. It was such a delight to find in the first place there. It was one of the very few better choices. And I liked the reading experience.A twelve-year-old girl, Nicky, and her widowed dad, Robert, finds a baby in the snow. The Dillon's secluded life out in the New Hampshire's woods are suddenly not so simple anymore. They saved the baby's life; they were responsible; and brave, but suddenly their lives changed without them being in the driver's seat of their destiny. The follow-up events opens up their hidden feelings which they were unable to share with each other, or the outside world, without them turning the key in the lock of their unspoken private worlds themselves.  It is a book for young adults, I would say, and a really gentle,fast, enjoyable read, but with a deep enough base to have me staying riveted to the story from the beginning to end. The book addresses the different forms of honesty, grief, happiness, love and choices. The young girl observes the events and is introduced into the world of serious issues, bigger than herself, very fast. A relaxing and feel-good read. The book is also very well written with all the plots coming together perfectly in the end. I would love to read more of the author's books."}, {"userName": "Claire", "userReviewDate": "Aug 17, 2012", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/10460749-claire", "userReview": "Finishing either the 4th or 5th Anita Shreve book and I'm just wrecked, as usual. It happens the same way every time so far. I begin reading, the story is set on the East Coast, Vermont, New Hampshire, by the ocean, and I think to myself,  hmm, I don't think I can relate to this. The character seems cold, or strange, alien.  Then a few page turns and I'm enraptured. Shreve has a talent that I wish I had, the talent of describing something that is indescribable to most people. Daily moments or feelings that sweep by and are forgotten just as fast, taken for granted, missed in the swirl of stronger emotions. She tells a story from the inside out, examining the bones and interiors, describing the mundane from a different perspective, revealing emotions that are so often pressed deep and hidden inside, even to ourselves. She does it in the most loving, accepting way. I always feel incredibly human when I read her stories, and that feels like the most beautiful thing to be in all our flawed, silly glory. There are always moments where I'm reading along, a person is walking or cooking or cleaning, putting on a shirt or taking one off, and then BOOM, Shreve makes an observation so incisive that it makes my chest feel like it's caving in. It often happens at the end of a chapter, as if she instinctively knew to give the reader some time to process that little exquisite bomb. Her stories are not incredible or lurid or even very complex usually, but the gift is all in the writing and the emotions of the characters. She expresses what they are feeling, what they are experiencing, how their lives find meaning in the tiny, everyday things. How they love and make love, how love ends and begins, how a tiny little detail can make your heart explode with longing for someone gone. Her characters have a past, and a present that we share, and then they always, ALWAYS have a future. You can tell that she loves them as if they are real people. She cannot bear to leave them hanging, and neither can we."}, {"userName": "Valerie", "userReviewDate": "Jul 13, 2012", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/9865241-valerie", "userReview": "I am glad I didn't base whether to read this book on the reviews here because I think a lot of people didn't \"get it,\" and maybe that's Shreve's failing, but I've observed that, by and large, people don't really understand grief until they experience it first hand, unfortunately. I know that I did not. So I think that people who have experienced the kind of grief that keeps you from getting out of bed will really appreciate this book, and those who have had blissfully uneventful lives will miss a lot of the subtlety in it.On the second page of the story, the narrator, Nicky, tells us she's 30 but the events she's relating occur when she is 12. Telling the story in the present tense rather than the past affirms that the Nicky is, at core, the same person she was back when, and yet the events brought on momentous change in her life.The cover copy tells us the main kernel of the story---Nicky and her dad, who live on the outskirts of a small New Hampshire town, find an abandoned baby in the woods. They rescue her and a couple of weeks later the mother shows up at their house to deal with what happened. We read that Nicky wonders what makes a family. What the cover copy doesn't go into is that the Nicky and her father are walking wounded, like the mother of the abandoned baby. They had lost half their family---Nicky's mother and her baby sister---two years prior to finding the abandoned baby. She and her father are coexisting in an emotionally frozen state, but she is just beginning her life and cannot stay frozen. Finding the baby awakens a fire within both of them because they have control over making something right, after having experienced the total chaos of unexpectedly losing half their family and being hurled into the unknown.The title of the book is an apt symbol of the main characters' situations. Light causes snow to melt or evaporate, eventually. The light is refracted and the energy spreads through the snow, warming and melting it. Light on snow can also blind you. You can be blinded by grief, too. But it's the snow, not the light, that's blinding. Our own frozen emotional states can cause us to see things harshly and keep us isolated from life-affirming experiences. But the light of truth makes everything right, eventually. Light on snow signals that the bad weather will eventually end. You need to persevere; things work out as they should, and though sometimes the process is more painful than you think you can stand, the spring and summer will come.Nicky, although grieving the loss of her mother and baby sister, is clearly ready to move on with her twelve-year-old life. We don't know where the father is at; we can only guess from the Nicky's observations, wherein she herself acknowledges there's a lot about her father she doesn't know. Connecting with the baby and the mother stirs a sense of family within her. She becomes an antagonist to her father and challenges his frozen way of seeing the world.I love how Shreve captured the mysteriousness of womanhood and childbirth to a prepubescent girl. How many of us women remember that state before our hormones took over and we were blissfully ignorant of the power within our bodies? Right at the threshold of her own womanhood, Nicky is imprinted with this woman's story of an unplanned pregnancy. At 12 years old, we are very morally black-and-white (often Nicky has fits about what's right or wrong), and yet Nicky was more ready than her father to consider the idea the mother might not have been at fault for the baby's abandonment, and to show the mother compassion as she tries to face her bad choices. Nicky's need to love and understand her world brings the mother's story to light where the wounds of injustice can begin to heal.Although I could see where the story was going, it didn't stop me from reading, or dull my pleasure, because Shreve went beyond the story line and captured the moment when grief changes, along with a girl's coming of age in an imperfect world. If I had a daughter, I'd make this required reading for her. It's a book I wish I could have read when I was a teenager."}, {"userName": "Diane Chamberlain", "userReviewDate": "Jul 21, 2008", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/1295401-diane-chamberlain", "userReview": "One of my favorite Shreve titles.

The target audience appeared to be young adult women, so this book was not really my thing. That being said, it took only about four hours to read, which was a plus (and is why the book is worthy of two stars). Many of the characters seemed like caricatures, and many of their actions were not very believable. The narrator was supposedly 30 at the time the narration was occurring, but sounds like she is 12. Young adult women who like coming of age stories about young adult women may like this book."}, {"userName": "Joy Barnes", "userReviewDate": "Aug 25, 2007", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/145973-joy-barnes", "userReview": "I\u2019ve never read Anita Shreve before, but I picked up this book at the Tokyo airport\u2026 it was a name I recognized and there were not a lot of English books to chose from. It turned out be a good choice. I enjoyed the book because the story and the characters seemed real. It was if this situation of finding a baby in the snow and plot that follows, could happen to anyone. I found that I was putting myself in the characters\u2019 shoes asking what I would do in the same situation. I don\u2019t want to simplify the characters\u2026 there were layers to their struggles that were both heartbreaking and heartwarming. It was a short book- I read it in one day of traveling\u2026 it almost felt like a long, \u201cshort story\u201d which was kind of refreshing. Overall, a good, entertaining book, with a twisted, yet realistic plot."}, {"userName": "Erin", "userReviewDate": "Feb 25, 2008", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/447067-erin", "userReview": "This book was a quick read, which I was in dire need of. The plot was interesting enough to keep my attention, although there were points where the author merely mentioned what would come of a certain seemingly insignificant event (i.e. When Nicky and her dad help shovel out the woman's car at the end of the novel and the author merely states: \"In the spring, my father will stop at the cottage with the wash outside and find a kind of love there with a woman and her there sons that in years to come will cause all sorts of joy and complications in my life...\") It's these sorts of comments that frustrate me and make me wish there was a sequel."}, {"userName": "Lucy Qhuay", "userReviewDate": "Jun 30, 2016", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/7115693-lucy-qhuay", "userReview": "Is that it? Really? I've read better pieces of news about the same subject and that provoked in me deeper emotions than this book.Talk about disappointment. Plus, the writing was bland and so were the characters.Nicky was okay. She was really mature and her thoughts were surprisingly insightful for her age.However, her father was a selfish, cowardly man, too lost in his own grief to support a young daughter going through the same process. And Charlotte? Her story could have been so much more than it was.Simply shameful."}, {"userName": "Pamela", "userReviewDate": "Dec 06, 2014", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/20048096-pamela", "userReview": "In general, I don\u2019t abide well with clutter. It\u2019s not that I\u2019m an OCD clean freak; life\u2019s too short to fret over a few dust bunnies. I simply function better in a reasonably neat and structured environment. However, when it comes to my TBR list, it\u2019s about as pell-mell as one can get. My reading tastes are hither-and-yon, and numerical TBR sequencing is simply a formality. So I think of my TBR as a literary menagerie for leisure enjoyment; No pressures. No deadlines. Reading whatever, whenever, in no certain order. Of course, there are logical times for reading specific books or genres: holidays, book clubs, vacations, seasons, current events, library due dates, etc. Typically though, it\u2019s more like matching a book to my mood. A few days ago I was in the mood for something simple yet complex, and wintry: \u201cLight on Snow.\u201dLast spring I found this delightful gem in a thrift store - seemingly brand new, stiff-spine, never been opened; the lavender sheen paper and stark winter scene called to me: \u201cPlease, take me home with you.\u201d Which I did, lovingly tucking it into my bookshelf, waiting for the perfect mood, the perfect moment to read it. Off and on as the months went past I wondered if that beautifully jacketed book would be as wonderful to read as it was to look at. Absolutely, it was. The quietly powerful coming of age story was everything I hoped it would be: Realistic, embraceable, unpretentious, contemplative, fluid, adeptly written, intriguing, flawed characters and believable circumstances, no hyperbole, no saccharine drivel, no conveniently contrived fairy-tale ending where poor choices have no consequences. Truly, I loved everything about this harrowing/hopeful story, including Nicky Dillion\u2019s twelve-year-old narrative, reliving the time when everything changed on a rain-slick night, and again two years later in winter. \u201cWhat makes a family? I wonder. My father and I are technically a family, but it\u2019s a word neither one of us would ever use. Yes, we are father and daughter, but because we were once members of a family that was torn apart, we think of ourselves now as half a family or a shadow family.\u201dThe thought of being lost in a blustery, snow-packed New England forest can traumatize the hardiest of souls. Having moved from the city to the country, Nicky Dillon was a far cry from nature savvy. But on this particular day, it was a matter of what was found, taking trauma to a totally incomprehensible level. Who could do such an unspeakable thing? Then when trauma came knocking at their door, Nicky began questioning everything. What is family? Why does right feel wrong? What is forgiveness? What is justice? Why is life sometimes so unfair? But rhetorical questions don\u2019t have concise answers. They do however open doors to conversations \u2013 conversations long overdue for letting go the past and learning to live again. Four \u2013 simply profound, unpretentious, genre specific Chick-Lit stars."}, {"userName": "Dale Harcombe", "userReviewDate": "Jul 09, 2013", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/4800708-dale-harcombe", "userReview": "Light on Snow reminded me why I like Anita Shreve\u2019s writing. The story of Nicky and Robert Dillon, her father, who find a new born baby in the snow while walking in the woods is simply told and caught me from the beginning. It is an easy read yet manages to uncover layers of how people make the decisions they do, as well as how they handle. Nicky and her father have suffered tragedy in their lives with the death of his wife and baby Clara. Nicky grieves for her mother and baby Clara, but in a very different way to Robert Dillon does. His solution is to isolate himself and Nicky but he doesn\u2019t realise how this isolation affects his daughter. She is desperately lonely. I liked the way it flashed back from the present situation to the past as it helps the reader understand more of Nicky and feel for her. Robert and Nicky rush the baby to hospital, saving the child\u2019s life. Where are the baby\u2019s parents? How they could do such a thing and how Robert and Nicky respond to this situation is the crux of the story. Anita Shreve is very good at including the small details that make the story come alive. She made me care about the characters and what happens to them. I\u2019m now looking forward to reading another Anita Shreve book I have here but needed a little change of pace first. If you like an emotional read where you care about the characters and wonder how you would react, you will enjoy this one."}, {"userName": "Eileen", "userReviewDate": "May 04, 2018", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/5749945-eileen", "userReview": "Recently, in the library I noticed an \u2018In Memorium\u2019 display for Anita Shreve. How sad that this talented author is no longer with us! Some of her novels have been long standing favorites. She writes so well, and in her stories the hook is usually set early! Light on Snow, written in 2004 was a rewarding discovery! The unique tale unfolded as told by an endearing twelve-year-old girl. I find I generally enjoy child narrators. Perhaps it takes a special talent to carry that off. The story involved a newborn baby girl found in the woods in the dead of winter. It was certainly an intriguing story line and kept me turning the pages!"}, {"userName": "Jennifer", "userReviewDate": "Sep 04, 2008", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/1351878-jennifer", "userReview": "If you enjoy a quick delve into the nature of grief, love, and family, but don't want to be overwhelmed with vicarious pain, then this is a good pick for you.The story is told in the first person by a woman looking back after many years on herself as an adolescent, but she uses the present tense for the current events of the story, and the past tense for longer-ago flashback events. I thought this made it feel less like a memoir and gave it more urgency. The author underlines the emotional elements of the story with frequent descriptions of the weather conditions and the landscape, but she doesn't indulge in ridiculous metaphors that might induce the gag reflex in the reader.Overall, I was pleasantly surprised by this novel. Though the plot was predictable in many ways, the predictable moments seemed to confirm the realism in the characters and situations rather than feeling like plot devices."}, {"userName": "Saman

"http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/1974534-diane", "userReview": "I enjoyed this book. While I have been disappointed with the latest installments of Shreve's books, this one came through. It's a character driven book, told by Nicky, the daughter of Robert Dillon. These are two people who have experienced much pain and tragedy in their lives. Nicky has lost her mother and her baby sister earlier in an accident. Her dad is all she has left. With the discovery in the woods of an abandoned baby, their lives unravel revealing layers that may never have been uncovered or hurts that would have remained buried. I thought it was great that this book, for once, wasn't about adultery. Her themes usually run with broken marriages. I loved Nicky and found myself thinking of her and her story long after I closed the book. The book is well written even though it is from Nicky's point of view. Her fondness for Charlotte, the baby's mother, made me realize how lonely she was for her own mother...the fact that she needed some nurturing from another female, albeit that Charlotte was only a few years older than her. I loved her father and his isolation and mourning made me feel so sad. He must have been so in love with his wife and of course Clara to not be able to get on with his life after their untimely death. He was paralyzed by his grief. His love for his oldest daughter shone through I think on every page. I felt that the ending was also realistic and I hoped that Nicky's dad would maybe get a glimpse of the possibility at a \"second chance\". It's funny how a book gets to you.

Os dois mudaram-se para l\u00e1 depois de a m\u00e3e e a irm\u00e3 beb\u00e9 de Nicky terem falecido num acidente de autom\u00f3vel, porque Robert desejava isolar-se do mundo e come\u00e7ar, de certo modo, uma vida nova. Numa das caminhadas pela neve que os dois costumam fazer, encontram um rec\u00e9m-nascido abandonado \u00e0 sua sorte, e este acontecimento ir\u00e1 mudar v\u00e1rias coisas na vida dos dois.O livro \u00e9 contado na primeira pessoa por Nicky, cerca de 20 anos depois dos acontecimentos centrais do livro, o que facilitou a voz da narradora, no sentido em que a narrativa podia ser adulta e n\u00e3o adequada \u00e0 idade que ela tinha na altura. Achei que tanto Nicky como o pai foram duas personagens bem constru\u00eddas; percebe-se bem quem s\u00e3o estas duas pessoas, quais os seus problemas interiores, a maioria deles marcados pelo acontecimento tr\u00e1gico da perda de metade da fam\u00edlia.O caso do rec\u00e9m-nascido abandonado no meio da neve \u00e9 intrigante e deixa o leitor curioso para saber o que aconteceu, mas a verdade \u00e9 que, apesar de influenciar a vida de Nicky e Robert, n\u00e3o \u00e9 explorado a fundo. A autora opta por centrar a narrativa nos dois, na rela\u00e7\u00e3o atual e na marca deixada pela perda que sofreram. N\u00e3o \u00e9 que n\u00e3o tenha sido bem feito, mas desiludiu-me que a premissa da hist\u00f3ria, o acontecimento que marca o seu in\u00edcio, se tenha tornado t\u00e3o secund\u00e1rio.Assim, e tendo sido um livro que gostei de ler e que considerei uma leitura interessante, parece que est\u00e1 de certo modo incompleto. Penso que a autora tinha aqui uma boa hist\u00f3ria, mas que precisaria de ser mais desenvolvida. Ainda assim, valeu a pena ler."}, {"userName": "Margi", "userReviewDate": "Jul 30, 2013", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/4972392-margi", "userReview": "I could not put this book down. I was totally engrossed in the storyline, plot and characters. This was a compelling, touching yet easy read. It tugged at my hearstrings as I shared the pain, grief, loss and loneliness that jumped out at me. I am not giving away much here other than it is told from a 12 year old's perspective as she reflects back on a time in her life when she is an adult. As she is telling the story it shifts backwards and forwards which helped me gain a better understanding of why Nicky and her father were suffering the grief, loss and loneliness that they were.

I loved how we are hearing about Nicky's past and how her and her father found a baby. I loved everything about her and her father. I liked how finding this baby made them feel alive and kind of like they had a purpose to live again. It's like the baby gave them life again. I feel like I might be saying everything wrong - but trust me, it was such a good book! The baby comes at a difficult time for Nicky and her dad. They lost the other half of their family and they are kind of living like zombies at the moment. Plus, the way that Nicky connects with this baby brought little tears to my eyes.

The premise is sad: a 12 year old girl and her father who have moved to an isolated house in New Hampshire after the mother and baby sister die in a car crash in New York are walking through the woods between their house and a small nearby motel and find (and save) a just-born baby that has been left in a sleeping bag to die on a winter night. But the story that follows is a beautiful, well-written compelling story of healing, hope, and forgiveness.One passage really spoke to me because I, too, have often wondered about the twists and turns of our lives that intersect with others' lives, and what would have happened if we'd taken a different path at all of the millions of forks in the road -- big and small.\"And then I begin to think about how my father and I drove north from New York and settled in a town called Shepherd. Charlotte and James drove south from Burlington and found a random motel in Shepherd. Our paths crossed on a single spot in the woods. But what if, I wonder, on the second day of our trip, my father and I had figured out the complicated interchange at White River Junction and gone north as we were supposed to do? What if my father had decided to make a go of it in New York after all? What if my mother had dropped a quarter at the register when she wasy buying a present for her parents at the mall and knelt to retrieve it, thus delaying her two seconds to her car? What if my father had not, as my morther had once told me, walked into the university library one spring morning to read about the Yankees-Orioles game the night before and seen my mother at the circulation desk, studying for a chemistry exam while putting in her work-study hourse, and asked her, on the spur of the moment, how he might get permission to look at a series of rare Jefferson drawings kept in the vault?I would not exist. My father and mother would not have married. There would have been no Clara.I want to believe that my father and I were meant to stumble across Baby Doris and give her a chance at life. But now I'm not so sure.

The daughter starts to really like Charolette the 19 year old, she see's her as a an older sister or mother. And doesnt want her to leave. But the father is upset about her leaving her baby in the snow to die. But he soon finds out that she never wanted her chuild to die. So the book is about how she is living with them and the troubles they go through. And what they go through with the law.I really enjoy'd this book because it's suspensful. And it has a lot of different emotions in it. Your sad about the girls mom and baby sister dying. But it's really cute how she bonds with Charolette. The writer has a lot of descriptive words and you can visual everything thats happening. It's a great book it keeps you hooked. I really enjoy'd it. It made me feel like I was in the book with them.The writer Anita Shreve wrote this book so good. It keeps you so hooked you dont wanna stop reading it. it's also a fast read. And I like how it tottally made you feel like you were in the book sitting their with ana and her father drinking hot chocolate by a warm fire. You can visualize everything in the book. It's great.

Don't expect a blockbuster plot, don't expect something momentous. Just take it for what it is and you won't be disappointed. It's more of a snapshot of the life of a father and daughter who live in an isolated cabin during a snowstorm and the finding of a baby in the snow which adds some drama and excitement into their lives - something that it sounds like the daughter really needs.Shreve did an EXCELLENT portrayal of a teenage daughter here. The dialogue is short, sweet, and encompasses the awkwardness between father and daughter perfectly. The daughter's yearning for something else in her life - a female presence, perhaps, is heartbreaking and so sweet. You'll want to adopt her.The only problem with this novel is that it's too short. There is so much more to this story you want to know. You will be up at night, after you read this, wondering what happened to the characters. It's a tantalizing bite that leaves you hungering for more. This was the first Shreve novel, I have read. I had two other books by her and I've read them all within the last week (I've had the flu and have had lots of time on my hands). The ones I've read so far all seem to be more about character development and developing believable characters rather than plot.

One day close to Christmas, Nicky and her father are taking a snowshoe walk in the winter snow, and respond to a baby cry. They are stunned to find a newborn baby girl abandoned in the snow.

I read this book in two sittings--it's easy and quick to read. The premise was very good and I thought the plot would be very interesting. It did hold my interest, as I wanted to see how the story finally resolved itself. But it ended up not to be as interesting as I anticipated. The bulk of the text was extremely redundant. Over and over again it snows, we are told the precise posture of Robert as he sits, it is cold, things get a little tense and Robert goes outside to shovel snow. And these things are repeated too many times to add value. But curiously, there are other details worth delving into that are left either untouched or merely skimmed over--details which could have lent some \"meat\" to this novel. That much was a disappointment.The writing was good, very accessible and very straightforward. Not a literary work of art, but a good plot and one that I wanted to see through to the end.

They rush the baby to the emergency room and save its life, but the events that happen after end up changing both of THEIR lives, as they go through different trying times to deal with the discovery of this young baby.This book was a pretty quick read, but very absorbing as each of the characters are dealing with their own inner demons.

I really liked this book but I couldn't give it four stars because other four star books were much better. This is \"a modest work\" according to a review on the back of the book. There are very few characters, a single plot line with references to something that took place in the past and essentially one setting. It hardly qualifies as a novel. As I read it in two sittings it seems like an extended short story. I'm not worried about the definition, I just want to point out that it doesn't pretend to be a major work. I can picture it as a Hallmark TV presentation or an independent film. At times I thought it might be meant for young adults as the main character is a girl twelve years old. In any case it is well written and very touching.Notice that I give no summary at all. I even recommend that you do not read the blurb on the back of the book that gives away a small part of the story. It's much better to follow the story as it unfolds.

The book is written in the present tense but is retold by Nicky, who is now 18. She tells her story of when she was 12 and had recently lost both her mother and baby sister in a car accident. Her widowed father desperately tries to move forward in his life and care for his young daughter. They move to a secluded home in the woods of NH, each struggling in their grief.
