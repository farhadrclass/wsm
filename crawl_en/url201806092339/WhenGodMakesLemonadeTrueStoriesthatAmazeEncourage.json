Sometimes it provides wisdom when the answers we seek fail to come; sometimes it's a shoulder to cry on when grief and loss are too much for one pair of shoulders to bare the burden alone; other times it's to provide hope when the situation in front of us is simply too much for us to deal with. In the latest inspirational book that is slated to be part of an ongoing series, author Don Jacobson, is compiling those stories that show what happens When God Makes Lemonade from the lemons life deals us. These short stories written by real people teach us all and encourage us that even though we can't always see the good in our storms, God brings about life changing experiences so we might encourage and help others out along the way. Don Jacobson begins the book with his own personal story of just how God walked with him when his life literally hung in the balance. Picking up his shotgun and taking a spare moment to venture off into the woods to try it out, Don was more than amazed when his gun malfunctioned and he ended up shooting himself. Failing to leave word behind to his wife of his intentions, his only companion was his dog, Big Boy. Not knowing how bad things really were, he heard the voice of God guiding him along the way. What happens next is something you'll have to pick up the book and read for yourself. \"The stories in When God Makes Lemonade are from everyday people who are surprised by unexpected sweetness in the midst of sour life circumstances. Why true stories? Because they give us hope, and in these difficult times, most of us don't need to be told to work harder - we're already working as hard as we can! What we need most is to be reminded that God is here working all things together for good. So if you're struggling beneath the weight of unemployment, depression, broken relationships, an unexpected death, or any of life's other difficulties, don't give up!Though the settings, names and outcomes are unique in each lemonade story, they all say the same thing - you're not alone!Yes, stuff happens in life, but so does lemonade, and when it does, it's as refreshing as a cold drink on a hot August day. May you find that kind of refreshment in the stories you read in this heartwarming book, and may God bless you with the courage you need to hold on.\" (Pg 18.)I received When God Makes Lemonade by Don Jacobson compliments of B and B Media Group and Thomas Nelson Publishers for my honest review. I did not receive any monetary compensation for a favorable review. The best part about this book is that each story is unique and each one provides the reader an opportunity to walk in the shoes of each author and see what the long term result was. Too often we think that no one understands just what we're going through, but this book provides friendship in knowing we are not alone in our personal struggles. Sometimes it gives us perspective that others have it worse than what we are dealing with. The best part is the opportunity to share your own story on When God Makes Lemonade's website. Who knows maybe you're story will be published in the next book and the struggles you deal with now, will be used to help someone else who reads them find the light at the end of their own dark tunnel again. I rate this one a 5 out of 5 stars!"}, {"userName": "Jenny Sulpizio", "userReviewDate": "Apr 06, 2013", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/5700824-jenny-sulpizio", "userReview": "I love THIS book. I love the premise behind this book...and most importantly, one can't help but love all of the inspiration to be gleaned just by delving in to this great read.

Some are funny, others are sobering, and more than a few will bring tears of amazement. But these true stories all have one thing in common: hope. There's no question that life gives us \"lemons,\" like issues with health, employment, and relationships. But when those lemons become lemonade, it's as refreshing as a cold drink on a hot summer day. It's true that in life \"stuff\" happens, but as you'll see in these stories, lemonade happens too!About The Author: Living Lemonade Story(in his own words).Don and Brenda\"Hi, I\u2019m Don Jacobson, and I\u2019m a walking, talking lemonade story. Back in 1980, I was a happily married twenty-four-year-old who enjoyed a physically demanding job in commercial construction. I knew my future was bright, and I knew what it would take to get there: hard work, planning, and dedication. Then, one winter night, a shooting accident changed everything. I nearly died as I lay for hours beneath a tree, but miracle after miracle happened to keep me alive\u2014a story you can read in full in God Makes Lemonade. I spent nine agonizing days in critical condition, and nearly a month in the hospital. When I left, things looked bleak, and I could no longer physically provide for my family. It took a while for God to turn that lemon into lemonade, but in the end it was wonderfully sweet. I began to work in Christian publishing, and the shape of my life changed forever. Now, 25 years later, I see that not being able to work with my hands forced me to work with my head and heart, and both my family and my career became better than I could ever have imagined. My wife, Brenda, and I know that the hardships of life have molded our characters and turned us into people we would never have been apart from the pain. Looking back, I wouldn\u2019t trade the hardest times of my life for anything, because they led me toward something better . . . something God had planned all along. When I share my lemonade story with friends, two amazing things happen. My story inspires others and gives them hope. Then, almost without fail, my friends excitedly tell me their lemonade story, and I\u2019m filled with inspiration and hope in return. Recently it hit me: we all have lemonade stories\u2014so what would happen if we could share them with the people around the world who need them most? That\u2019s the dream of the God Makes Lemonade series: to publish true stories to encourage people in sour circumstances that God is at work making lemonade. What\u2019s your story?\"My Thoughts On The Book: We all have a lemonade story or two tucked back in our memories. I am no exception. This book touched every fiber of my being. Each story was different and although they may not have all touched me directly, as a paster's wife they all provided some nugget I could keep with me for future reference. Each dramatic story is woven together in this tight night book and very encouraging. It is the kind of book you can read in one sitting (if you have enough kleenex on hand), or read a few at each sitting. We all need hope in our lives and this book is exactly what the doctor ordered. Each story is filled with hope and grace....and love. It was a blessing to read this book and I hope my readers will want to read it too. It is captivating and filled with gifts just for the reader. Life does give us lemons sometimes but God can take those hardships and make them into something better....Lemonade.Disclosure of Material Connection: I received this book free from Book Sneeze.

But when those lemons become lemonade, it's as refreshing as an ice-cold drink on a hot summer day.About Don JacobsonDon JacobsonDon Jacobson's twenty-five years in publishing included serving as the president and owner of Multnomah Publishers, where he oversaw the production of more than 1000 titles, including the five-million-plus-selling series Stories for the Heart. He's had the pleasure of working with such best-selling authors as Randy Alcorn, Joni Eareckson Tada, Henry Blackaby, Robin Jones Gunn, Karen Kingsbury, Andy Stanley, and Bruce Wilkinson. Don's wife, Brenda, has been mentoring mothers for more than a decade.Jacobson and his wife are passionate about helping single mothers and their children, so the royalties from God Makes Lemonade will benefit these unsung heroes through the LemonAid Foundation.My Review:Being a huge lover of Chicken Soup for the Soul books when they first came out, I've loved sharing peoples stories of love, compassion, joy, happiness and even the occasional sad story. I think its what unites us with one another as humans. We can empathize with what someone had to endure and we can place ourselves in that situation and share in that emotional connection.In the book, God Makes Lemonade by Don Jacobson, you will once more gain a beautiful collection of stories that will make you laugh, smile and yes, grab that box of tissues for some sweet tears of both sadness and joy! There is virtually a story in here for everyone from parents to singles; to strangers and families, you are guaranteed to find something in here to connect to. I loved this collection and have been sharing them with my family over dinner as a way to create a dinner topic conversation, to see where our thoughts are and how we would handle a situation. This one rates a perfect 5 out of 5 stars.

The premise of the book is that despite the difficulty, the person or persons involved in the different stories were able to get something good out of the bad situation\u2013that God made a sweet drink of lemonade out of the sour circumstances they lived through.Some of these stories are like that. Individuals survived a difficult time period, but ultimately when looking back through the perspective of time, a really good thing came out of the trying circumstances. The people involved had a nice sweet drink of lemonade in the end, or at least, eventually. But to be honest, some of these stories are really hard to read, and the supposed \u201cgood outcome\u201d is a stretch. In other words, sometimes that drink of lemonade is pretty sour in the end.I understand that real life isn\u2019t always neat and pretty. But the author states on the front cover of the book that the stories inside will \u201camaze and encourage.\u201d To be honest, I did not feel encouraged by many of these stories. Instead I felt pretty glum and downcast by some of them. I commend the men and women in the more difficult stories for still seeing lemonade in the end. I do admire the people for holding onto their faith in God despite some heart rendering situations.At the end, Don Jacobson states he wants to write more of these type of books. He also gives his contact information for anyone who would like to contribute a true story.The author promises the accounts in this book will be encouraging. Although he tells many incredible stories, the bottom line is many of these narratives leave you feeling sad and frustrated. Given the book fails on its promise to encourage, I can only give it 3 stars.The publisher has provided me with a complimentary copy of this book through Thomas Nelson Publishing for the purpose of review.

In this collection, Don (who is the former president and owner of a major publishing company, Multnomah) has given us several true, short stories written in the words of the people who experienced them. Each story is unique, though they all share the quality of reminding us how God truly does turn some very sour life situations into a sweet, refreshing drink of Living Water when we need it most.Some stories will make you laugh, many will make you cry (or at least get a little moisture in your eyes)...but all do remind you that you are not alone in the trials you face in life. From a story of a father who learned to show love and grace to his son after initially belittling him for his uncontrollable bedwetting problem, to stories of dire financial straights and the strength that came through enduring those times and learning of God's loving provision first-hand, to stories of unexpected and unwanted health issues, to a story of twins who share a unique bond that is miraculously enhanced through a life-threatening tragedy...so many true life events and lessons...straight from those who have lived them.

God knows what is best for us even though we may not understand. He sees the big picture of our life, as we maintain a limited view. Some events can be extremely bad when we put all of our focus on them, but then we step back and look at how it could have been far worse.

There were so many touching stories combined that this book is not meant to be devoured, but savored. This is the perfect read for a long car ride or to put by the bedside table. This book is recommended for teens/young adults/adults."}, {"userName": "Marjorie", "userReviewDate": "Jun 28, 2013", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/10137053-marjorie", "userReview": "Amazing stories of heartache turned into beauty and joy. Miracles happen every day, but sometimes those miracles go unnoticed because of lack of perspective. These stories will truly \"Amaze and Encourage\" just as it says in the subtitle. One of my mom's best friends, Amy von Borstel, wrote a story of her own that's included in this book. I love this book and I read a story in it almost every day! It shows how God works in different peoples' lives, and how everyone's story is a little different and inspirational!
