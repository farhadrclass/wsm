Some people - white people - didn't, or couldn't, understand what she meant. They should probably read this book, for while it is a dense, incredibly detailed chronicle of Lyndon Johnson's Senate years, it is also the story of civil rights in America. It's a disgusting story. There were times I was so infuriated reading this book I had to put it down and have a drink. I wanted to go find Strom Thurmond's grave, and piss on it. Voltaire once wrote that \"history is nothing more than a tableau of crimes and misfortunes.\" That just about sums of the United States Senate and its obstruction, for almost 100 years, of any meaningful civil rights legislation. Master of the Senate continues Robert Caro's hot streak. So far, it is the longest of the three. While I still consider Path to Power the best (I really loved the chapter on Rayburn), Master is a close second. Caro has done a superb, almost lawyerly job of maintaining his thesis on Johnson: a crass, brown-nosing, devious, sneaky, weaselly power grabber who, once he had accumulated great power, decided to wield it for what amounted to an absolute good. I've previously noted that the first two volumes of The Years of Lyndon Johnson were extraordinary for the disdain with which Caro treated his subject. Johnson came off as a small man of amorphous ideals, willing to lie and cheat to get what he desired most: power (Johnson's story reminds me of Napoleon's dictum that accumulation of power requires absolute pettiness, while exercise of power requires true greatness). Caro starts to soften on Johnson is this book, noting that whatever shenanigans he took part in to get power, in the end, he used that power for righteousness. He was, as Caro notes, the greatest champion of civil rights to ever hold high office. Indeed, he takes his place with Abraham Lincoln and Martin Luther King as the most effective civil rights leaders in history. Whatever else you say about Johnson, he has the Great Society as his legacy, and that ain't nothing. Master of the Senate is a long book; at times, the amount of information is overwhelming. It begins with a long discourse on the history of the US Senate. While it sometimes felt that this history, while interesting, was just Caro showing off as an historian, his point becomes clear. The way the Senate is set up, with its arcane parliamentary rules, makes it a bulwark - what Caro calls a \"dam\" - against change. By design, the Senate is meant to maintain the status quo by giving the minority - in the case of civil rights, the South - an inordinate amount of power to keep things from getting done. Part of the reason this book is so long is Caro's constant rehashing of previously-told events. This is why I called the book lawyerly. For even though it is brilliantly, at times beautifully written, it also is making a point. Caro has a thesis, and he uses and reuses events from Johnson's life to make this point. This is both good and bad: bad because you keep going over the same stories, the same quotes; good because it sticks in your head. It's what they teach you in legal writing: start by telling the audience what you are going to say; say it; then remind your audience what they've just been told. Like his other Johnson books, Caro spends a lot of time fleshing out the peripheral characters, though oddly enough, Lady Bird and Johnson's children are seldom mentioned. Unlike the previous two books, there is no \"hero\" to stand in contrast to Johnson, as Sam Rayburn did in Path to Power and Coke Stevenson did in Means of Ascent. Instead, we are treated to a lengthy biography of one of humanity's great and unknown villains: Richard Brevard Russell, \"a Russell of the Russells of Georgia.\" Russell, like Robert E. Lee, was a courtly, well-spoken gentleman who stood on the side of evil and yet, because of his patrician nature, somehow gets a pass from history. Not from Caro. Though he is an excellent historian, this is not a purely objective book, and some passages on Russell drip with contempt and scorn. Of course, scorn is the least that Russell deserves. There is also a chapter devoted to Minnesota's finest, the liberal lion Hubert Horatio Humphrey, whom Senator Paul Douglas called \"the orator of the dawn.\" Oddly, though Humphrey is given a big rollout, we don't really learn a lot about him, and though he hovers in the background, his roll is secondary. I'm assuming that Johnson's eventual vice-president will get a lot more print in the next volume. A lot is packed into this mammoth book: a history of the Senate; Humphrey's 1948 convention speech; Johnson's sub-committee work during the Korean War (where he shamelessly self-aggrandized); Johnson's maneuvering to become a powerful Majority Leader; the Senate investigation into the removal of Douglas MacArthur; the communist witch hunts of Joe McCarthy; Johnson's near-fatal heart attack; and much more. Of course, the great event, the singular event around which all other events orbited, the aptly named Great Cause, was the passage of the 1957 Civil Rights Bill. The Bill was weak and near meaningless. Indeed, Johnson was assailed at the time for helping to gut it. Yet it was the first civil rights bill passed in the Senate since 1875; all other attempts had been filibustered by the South. Caro goes into incredible, at times excruciating detail, as to how Johnson, in order to become a presidential contender (Caro notes that when Johnson's ambition coincided with the chance to do good, America benefited) cut this Gordian knot. There is no way to summarize the labyrinthine maneuvers required to get even a weak civil rights bill through the Senate, yet Caro manages to make even the Byzantine rules of the Senate understandable. The book's sharp focus on the Senate years means that you lose out a lot on Johnson's personal life, though Caro does spend some time dwelling on his affair with Helen Gahagan Douglas. Also, interestingly, Jack Kennedy has almost no role whatsoever. This leads to my final thought: there is no way on God's green Earth that Caro manages to fit LBJ's vice presidency, presidency, and post-presidential life into one volume. I know The Years of Lyndon Johnson was initially conceived as a trilogy and has been adjusted to a quadrilogy; now, I think Caro should admit that he's going to need two more books. There's just two many characters (MLK, JFK, Bobby Kennedy, Westmoreland, McNamara) and too many events (LBJ's sad vice-presidency, the assassination, the Great Society, Vietnam, Humphrey's loss in '68) for just one more book, unless that book is 2000 pages long."}, {"userName": "Darwin8u", "userReviewDate": "Oct 03, 2017", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/2294090-darwin8u", "userReview": "\u201cPower concedes nothing without a demand. It never did and never will\u201d\u2015 Robert A. Caro, Master of the Senate The first thing one must discuss when talking about this book is its size. Its umpf. Its heft. It doesn't come to you, you go to it. Weighing in at almost 2lbs, this book is 3x the size of premature babies that survive now. It is a beast: 1167 pages including notes and index. But man, there was a gem on every page. And not just a historical detail, but Caro's prose makes this book easier consume than a ice tea on a hot August day. Every book I finish in this series, makes me even more certain that this may be one of the greatest biographies of the last 100 years.Master of the Senate, is the third book in Caro's (eventually there should be five volumes; four have been published so far about 1 per decade) 'Years of Lyndon Johnson', and focuses primarily on Johnson's tenure in the Senate. The book examines, in detail, LBJ's RISE to power in the Senate, his revolutionary GENIUS in extracting new powers, and his USE of those powers both to aid his quest for the White House and in passing the 1957 Civil Rights law. One can think of this book as almost three distinct works. There is so much to think about with just THIS volume, it helps to break it into smaller bites:PARTS I&II (Pgs 1 - 350) -The first 1/3 examines the history of the Senate and the rise of the seniority system and the South's dominance in the Senate leadership. It examines LBJ's entrance into the Senate and his struggles to fit in and find his place. It then examines Richard Russell (the guy they named the Russell Senate building after) and his family's history and his history and rise to power in the US Senate. Why? Because Senator Russell was to become the key to LBJ's success in the Senate. The first 1/3 of the book examines how LBJ used many of the same techniques to develop a relationship with Russell that in his House years he used with Sam Rayburn (LBJ had a way with older men with power: Rayburn, Russell, LBJ). The first 1/3 ends with LBJ destroying the career and reputation of Leland Olds when he was re-appointed to head the FPC (Federal Power Commission) in 1949. In doing so, LBJ was able to gain some more cred with Texas' oil industry and with his Southern fellow senators. The last bit of the first section also details Johnson's use of his \"Preparedness Investigating\" subcommittee (similar to the one used by Truman during WWII) in order to raise his name recognition during the beginning of the Korean War. Caro contrasts the way that LBJ ran the committee with the way that Truman ran his.PARTS III&IV (Pgs 351 - 682) - The second 1/3 examines the role of the Senate Majority leader and how past senators who controlled the gavel failed to control the US Senate. Part of the issue was most of the power in the Senate was controlled by committee chairmen and those seats were based on seniority. Caro describes how the Senate fit LBJ and how he quickly adapted to the Senate's formalities and unique customs. And he watched. He gathered information on senators, their needs, wants and weaknesses. He also maintained access to Texas oil, which meant he had access to money. Before LBJ, the Senate Majority leader job was considered a \"nothing job\". It didn't give you power, and it created huge risks. But that was before LBJ. LBJ discovered that knowledge and coordination is power. This section also develops a chapter about Senator Humphrey. Humphrey's relationship with Johnson is important because he is an interesting contrast to Johnson AND because their friendship and relationship is important to both later. So LBJ, through his relationship with Russell gets named as the youngest Majority Leader. Using his unique skills, his work-ethic, his ability to understand people's needs and weaknesses Johnson starts to consolidate power. He begins to use power. Johnson also understand that with a weak Republican party, and a pragmatic president, the Democrats can gain power by helping President Eisenhower to accomplish many of his goals. This period also involved dealing with Senator McCarthy. Not directly, Johnson NEVER moves early. But he patiently waited, perhaps too long, to do anything. As Johnson gains more power, his quietness fades and the old lapel-grabbing, power using Johnson returns. You don't cross Senator Johnson now. If you do, you won't get the committee assignment you want, or your bill won't be heard, or you will be shunned. With his exercise of power Johnson starts to make the Senate work. The senate, a place where bills went to die, now begins to operate. With Johnson at the controls, things begin to get done. Johnson's name starts to rise.

Now we are getting to the drama and corruption at an interesting scale - the US Senate. And the portrait we have of Johnson is fascinating. Lyndon Johnson was just simply power hungry. He had no principles of note, no things he was on a mission to do - except to hold as much power as he could. But he was brilliant at reading people, knowing what they wanted, and finding ways to horse-trade in his huge and growing network - and help them get it. A genius at being a politician. But lacking principles - I hope there are politicians that can do both.But this is not just a book about LBJ and his time in the senate - it is a history of the senate, and of 1960's America. I didn't appreciate the power the Senate has in US politics - small numbers of senators can block legislation for a long time. The book hints that WWII can be blamed on the senate - because the president wanted to act against Hitler much earlier but the senate didn't let him - a crazy allegation if true. And the filibusters! I didn't appreciate what those really were and how powerful they were. It was also very impressive reading how quickly LBJ took over leadership of the Senate - most senators had to wait until they were old to have the seniority to do much - LBJ within two years of being a senator had become elected leader and then did away with the seniority rule - both unprecedented changes. And of course, much of the book is about the fact that the southern senators collaborated to prevent any civil rights legislation for 100 years. It was well into the 20th century before African Americans got the right to vote, and we removed segregation - and this delay is all due to the senate. LBJ is known for being the president who passed civil rights - but the story of how he was a \"southern senator\" (from Texas) who had the southern senators as his base, but had to pass civil rights bills through the senate in order to make the liberals believe he was on their side so he could have a presidential bid - was fascinating. He did it not caring a single bit about the actual cause - it was simply the only path to be president, as the country had hit a point where the northerners were no longer going to let segregation go on, and the southerners were only going to give it up over their dead bodies. LBJ worked both sides, found compromises, made each side believe he was really on their side, and got the first ever civil rights bill of the 1900's passed to give African Americans the right to vote."}, {"userName": "HBalikov", "userReviewDate": "Apr 18, 2011", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/929238-hbalikov", "userReview": "Caro makes history as compelling as fiction.

It's sad that he's only turned out 4 books in the last 35 years, but each one is so exceptionally researched and well-written. Master of the Senate is another chapter in Caro's multi-volume study of Lyndon Johnson, focusing on his time in the Senate, specifically his efforts to pass the first Civil Rights bill since Reconstruction. His study of the political dynamics of the Senate in the 1950s, including the entrenched fecklessness of the Republicans and the deep divisions between the conservative (southern & western) democrats and the northeastrern liberal democrats is amazingly informative and insightful. So much of the modern political landscape we are so familiar with today stems from the moments recounted in this book, including the black vote being 90% democrat and the 30+ year republican lock on the (white) southern states.A great book if you're interested in American politics and the dynamics of power in the federal government. Also, the book is stand alone. You don't have to read the previous two volumes of the Lyndon Johnson series to appreciate it."}, {"userName": "Frank Stein", "userReviewDate": "Sep 18, 2009", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/1398873-frank-stein", "userReview": "Yes, this, the third volume in the Johnson biography, is also one of the best books ever written, like the other ones. And yes, I can't wait until the next volume comes out.Caro is such a great writer because he is so honestly interested in the minutiae of process, and he treats all his great works as procedural thrillers. He doesn't just want to know that Johnson was able to win a vote in the Senate, he wants to know exactly how he did it, what horse-trades he had to make, what motions he would use to speed up or slow down the vote, how he would organize the investigative committees to proselytize for his cause. Caro discovers how Johnson hired his staff from executive departments, how he acquired extra office space, how he was able to threaten or cajole other members into supporting him. And all this doesn't come across as irrelevant detail because Caro is able to show how important it all is, not just for Johnson but for the country, and to simultaneously show the kind of intelligence and drive it took to pull it all off.Surprisingly, with a book of this heft, it is not exactly comprehensive. Out of the ten years covering four or five are treated in no more than a few pages. It is really a series of case studies that focus on particular aspects of the Senate in the 1950s: the subcommittee investigative hearings on Korean war preparedness, the vote on the confirmation of Federal Power Commissioner Leland Olds, and the passage of the 1957 Civil Rights Act. Each of these dramatizes a different part of the Senate's operation, and makes the reader understand exactly what the Senate does and how it does it like no other book can.I have to say that Caro could be a little repetitive when emphasizing a dramatic point (yes, by the third volume I know Johnson was very ambitious), but its worth it."}, {"userName": "Max", "userReviewDate": "Oct 13, 2014", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/8079403-max", "userReview": "Like the second, the third volume of The Years of Lyndon Johnson progresses from a slow start to a riveting finish. In the first 100 pages Caro recounts the exercise of power in the Senate from its inception to the time Lyndon Johnson entered in 1948. At that time, the firmly entrenched seniority system vested unmitigated power in the committee chairmen who were old, conservative and southern. This instructive history lesson gives us the context we need to assess Johnson\u2019s significant accomplishments to follow. Johnson as a freshman senator quickly sizes up the situation, lays out his plan and executes it with precision in spite of seemingly overwhelming obstacles. He uses his magic with older men, sucking up to the existing Senate leaders, Richard Russell most prominently, winning their trust and support. He brings national attention to himself taking control of a minor subcommittee and blowing out of all proportion its minor findings. He ascends to power as he has in the past, by taking a thankless job, in this case assistant leader or whip, and transforming it into one of importance. Along the way he pleases his Texas financial backers by lambasting a hapless Leander Olds as a communist. As chairman of the Federal Power Commission, Olds tightly regulated oil and gas prices. Johnson took him out ensuring continued generous financial support from Texas oilmen. As a telling example of LBJ\u2019s ethics, after completely destroying Olds in front of the nation, he walked up to him after the hearing to shake his hand saying he didn\u2019t mean anything personal, it was just politics and he hoped they were still friends. Even though Johnson didn\u2019t really believe or probably even care whether Olds was a communist, neither did he believe that he had done anything wrong in ruining him.Much of volume three documents the slipping and sliding Johnson does between liberals and conservatives first as whip and then as majority leader. He always bends just enough to keep each side in his debt yet never goes so far as to alienate the other. He is the Senate dance master. And he gets things done, settling issues without extended fights. Bills get passed as conflicts are resolved in a way we could never envision in today\u2019s Congress. In the Johnson style, each step of the way he accumulates power as he rewards those who help and ostracizes those who don\u2019t. You are either a member of his team or forget ever getting anything for yourself or your constituents. Who else could have the support at the same time of both Hubert Humphrey and Richard Russell?Civil Rights was an issue Johnson had decided not to take on, letting the Southern Democrats empowered by the filibuster prevent any serious effort at a bill. Two things changed that. First was the nationwide clamor for action that developed in the wake of the Emmett Till murder case and the Montgomery busing segregation chaos with widespread violence and bombings. Buttressed by TV images and widespread popular magazine coverage, Civil Rights would no longer be dispatched to the background. Second was Johnson\u2019s presidential bid debacle at the 1956 Democratic convention. His delusions of grandeur shattered, he realized his perception by the nation as a sectional leader of the now even further diminished South stood in the way of his presidential ambitions.The Civil Rights bill of 1957, a weak attempt at protecting minority voting rights, was LBJ\u2019s answer to his dilemma. In describing how this bill was engineered and became law Caro is at his best. Despite the bill\u2019s shortcomings it took unbelievable dedication and skill to get it passed. Caro encapsulates clearly why Johnson was truly the \u201cMaster of the Senate\u201d. Regardless of what one thinks of the final bill or Johnson\u2019s character, one has to recognize a remarkable individual who better than anybody understood how to gain and use power. Having read the first two volumes serves the reader well here. They show how everything in Johnson\u2019s life culminated in the person that could accomplish the extraordinary. It is almost impossible to imagine anyone else getting this legislation passed.I am left with a fundamental question. Today\u2019s Congress is hopelessly deadlocked. This is normal. As Caro\u2019s history lesson of the Senate illustrates so well, only under unusual circumstances (civil war, depression) did the Senate get anything done, except of course what financial interests paid for. Could Lyndon Johnson control the Senate today? Would we want him too? Is self-aggrandizement, deceit, intimidation and the rawest of power politics necessary for progress? Is it worth it?"}, {"userName": "Leslie", "userReviewDate": "Jan 19, 2009", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/1928279-leslie", "userReview": "This is an excellent book on two levels: it sheds light on the character of Lyndon Johnson and it reveals the intricate workings of the US Senate. I was appalled by the side of LBJ that Caro uncovers. He was an ego-maniacal bully who used physical intimidation and lies to manipulate those around him. He was the youngest Senator to hold the position of Senate majority leader and he was truly masterful at claiming and wielding the power that came with that position. The book uses the famous Civil Rights legislation as the main example of how Johnson used his power to accomplish his goal, which ultimately, was purely personal and power-based.I loved getting a behind-the-scenes look at how the Senate is run. It's amazing how these people find a way to work together or get anything accomplished given their egos and personal goals and constituency expectations. The Economist ran an article recently about how dynastic the Senate has been historically and it truly seems that nothing has changed in that regard.

His accomplishments, maneuvering, and overall dominance as a tactician are all the more remarkable when you consider the regular, alternating fits of paralysis and tantruming that have unfortunately come to characterize the modern day, pitiful excuse for the United States Senate we've inherited. Caro's knowledge, both of the institution and of the man himself, is clearly comprehensive, but what I loved about \"Master of the Senate\" was the fact that the depth of the research propelled the historical drama forward rather than reducing it to an endless, mindless recitation of people, places, things and dates. Highly recommended. Think of me towering over you LBJ-style, threatening YOUR chairmanship of some important committee and bullying you into reading it...even though it is long."}, {"userName": "Steve", "userReviewDate": "Nov 25, 2017", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/20093073-steve", "userReview": "https://bestpresidentialbios.com/2017...\u201cMaster of the Senate: The Years of Lyndon Johnson\u201d is the Pulitzer Prize-winning third volume in Robert Caro\u2019s series covering the life of Lyndon B. Johnson. Caro is a former investigative reporter and the author of another Pulitzer Prize-winning biography: \u201cThe Power Broker\u201d reviewing the life of Robert Moses. He is currently working on the fifth (and presumably final) volume in his LBJ series.Published in 2002, \u201cMaster of the Senate\u201d covers Johnson\u2019s life from 1949 through 1960 \u2013 the dozen years he spent in the U.S. Senate. With 1,040 pages, this is the longest of the four volumes which have been published to date. And while books in this series are designed to stand on their own (for anyone interested in just one part of LBJ\u2019s life) this volume is most compelling for readers tackling the entire series.Fans of Caro\u2019s series will quickly recognize his writing style: it is articulate but often long-winded. Sentences are frequently complex but incorporate profound observations. And like preceding volumes, \u201cMaster of the Senate\u201d is supported by painstaking research and an ability to dive deeply and thoughtfully into a topic. But while the primary story line itself is inherently fascinating, protracted digressions and diversions are common.This third volume begins with a lengthy but often engrossing history of the United States Senate. The first half of this introductory section is so stirring and descriptive that I read it twice to ensure I didn\u2019t miss anything. But as informative as this 100+ page preamble proves, it eventually overstays its welcome and needlessly delays LBJ\u2019s appearance in the narrative.Once the biography turns to Johnson, it rarely lets go. The narrative focuses almost exclusively on LBJ\u2019s political life and the public world in which he operated. This volume chronicles his crusade to accumulate and exert power \u2013 from his earliest days in the Senate up to his nomination as his party\u2019s 1960 vice presidential nominee. Not covered here (reserved for the next volume) is LBJ\u2019s attempt to obtain the 1960 presidential nomination which was ultimately secured by John F. Kennedy.Caro is at its best while revealing LBJ\u2019s shrewd efforts to quickly gain credibility, power and influence in the Senate. Nearly one-third of the book is devoted to the Civil Rights Act of 1957 and the political maneuvering which ensured its passage. And where the narrative in previous volumes is often hostile toward LBJ, Caro employs a noticeably softer touch here in light of Johnson\u2019s extraordinary \u201cpivot\u201d on civil rights.Like earlier volumes, Caro provides mini-biographies of important supporting characters of the era. Chapters on Richard Russell and Leland Olds are excellent\u2026though Caro could have been far more efficient with his review of LBJ\u2019s political evisceration of Olds. Surprisingly absorbing is the later chapter describing how Johnson spent the weeks following his 1955 heart attack.But some of the very best chapters in this biography are those devoted to the difficulties faced by African-Americans in the early-to-mid 20th century South and LBJ\u2019s public and private attitudes toward minority rights. \u201cThe Compassion of Lyndon Johnson\u201d is undoubtedly one of the best chapters from any book I\u2019ve read recently.Almost as captivating is Caro\u2019s examination of Johnson\u2019s effort to gain the 1956 Democratic presidential nomination. This canny review includes a lengthy and detailed chapter on the Chicago convention which will appeal to almost any reader. Not surprisingly, however, the chapter would have been equally effective (and more accessible) at half its length.Typical of Caro\u2019s volumes is that much of LBJ\u2019s personal life is sacrificed in order to focus more fully on his political life. Readers interested in understanding LBJ\u2019s marriage to Lady Bird, his relationship with his children, or the disposition of his alleged dalliances will not come away significantly enlightened.More irksome for many readers, however, is Caro\u2019s penchant for literary loquacity. Nearly every topic he reviews \u2013 from those aimed squarely at LBJ\u2019s life to the numerous tangents he incorporates to supply context and supporting detail \u2013 could have been covered with far more efficiency while proving no less revealing. As good as this book is, its unnecessary heft undoubtedly intimidates many potential readers.Overall, Robert Caro\u2019s \u201cMaster of the Senate\u201d proves to be far more than a biography focusing on LBJ\u2019s years in the Senate: it is essentially a political history of the United States during the 1950s and a fascinating primer on the acquisition and use of political power. At its worst it is insightful but tediously turgid; at its best it is good \u2013 astoundingly good.Overall rating: 4\u00bc stars"}, {"userName": "Mh", "userReviewDate": "Sep 24, 2011", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/6435711-mh", "userReview": "After 3 volumes and 3000+ pages (probably 4000+ counting all the notes, which are well worth reading), I can't think of a better term to describe this bio of LBJ than \"page-turner.\" Actually, I can think of lots of better terms: compelling, gripping, exhaustively detailed, amazingly well researched and documented, vivid, compassionate, fair, unblinking, dogged, and probably the greatest analysis of political power in 20th century America that will ever be written. Quite simply, I love this book, with a love that I normally feel only for fiction. I initially picked up the first volume 3 years ago because I wanted to understand how LBJ could have been responsible for some of the greatest good things that happened in my lifetime, but also some of the greatest bad things. For the first 2500 pages, all I found was awfulness. It's a real tribute to Robert Caro's gifts as a writer that he made me want to keep reading about someone who, with every page, seemed more and more loathsome. It's only towards the end of the 3rd volume (around about 1956) that I began to see a glimmer, not of goodness exactly, but of compassion, empathy, and standing up for what was right.I checked the first three volumes out of the library, and was going to do the same with the fourth. But then I read Caro's acknowledgements at the end of \"Master of the Senate,\" in which he praised his publisher and editor and book designer and any number of other people at Knopf. And I realized that I wanted to acknowledge all the people responsible for this fantastic work myself, by paying them for their work.

After recently reading volumes one and two, I had come to know the man from Texas, and now in volume three I\u2019ve seen LBJ truly in his element, trading favors and exploiting arcane rules to turn the Senate on its complacent ear. Yet even as I call LBJ \u201cthe man from Texas,\u201d I know where he preferred to be. Not on the sleepy Pedernales, as much as he could wax eloquent about it, but in the heart of Washington, exercising power.Master of the Senate covers Johnson\u2019s rise from raw new Senator to dominance of that body, taking us through many side roads, including Johnson\u2019s first heart attack and his ill-conceived run for the Democratic nomination for the Presidency in 1956. Caro\u2019s central thesis: LBJ was a ruthless man who would do anything to gain power. He also cared about the poor and minorities, but when there was conflict between these two motivations, the rush to power would win every time. HOW HE ACQUIRED POWER...When he arrived in the Senate in early 1949, Johnson adopted a tactic which had served him well in the past. He chose a mentor who could open doors for him, and \u2013 as in his relationship with Sam Rayburn in the House \u2013 he chose well. Georgia\u2019s Richard Russell dominated the Southern caucus, whose conservative members exercised exceptional control in the Democratic Party through committee chairmanships, other benefits of seniority, and the filibuster. Russell was determined to maintain the status quo in the South, to preserve a way of life characterized above all by separation of the races.For his entire Senate career, Johnson was beholden to the Southern caucus and to the support of Russell. Johnson repeatedly had to demonstrate his solidarity with the Southern caucus, but there was another group to whom he was beholden: the moneyed oil and energy moguls of Texas. To show them he was loyal, he took on a subcommittee chairmanship to look into the renomination of Leland Olds as chairman of the Federal Power Commission. Olds was a particularly effective bureaucrat who drew the enmity of the energy entrepreneurs because the FPC was a New Deal program to reduce private control over natural resources. Olds was a genius at figuring out the tangled financial arrangements of the giant companies, and they wanted him out. Johnson accomplished just that by falsely tying Olds to Communism, manipulating the hearings to effectively destroy the man. Thus Johnson had his conservative bona fides. [Olds was devastated. Johnson assured him it was \u201cjust politics.\u201d Personally, I just felt sick.]HOW HE USED IT...In the next few years, Johnson became the man whom Russell believed could be the first Southern President, and he worked to position him, helping him to become first Minority Leader, then Majority Leader. Johnson proved masterly at moving legislation through a body which had become known for its torpor. But then Johnson recognized that he would have to become more acceptable to increasingly restive liberal Democrats.Every year, Senators like Paul Douglas and Herbert Lehman attempted civil rights legislation to address terrible inequities of the Jim Crow states \u2013 and they could never overcome the Southern filibuster. In 1957, Johnson maneuvered a severely compromised version of the bill that Russell and his compatriots would not filibuster. It was a watered-down voting rights bill that lacked teeth (and, perhaps more seriously, was not enforced by the Eisenhower Justice Department). But it was the first civil rights legislation in modern times, and it was Johnson\u2019s \u201cmasterpiece,\u201d as the headlines trumpeted. It was the break-through, and Caro turns the story of its passing into a near thriller \u2013 150 pages of twists, turns, dead ends, opportunities, and finally triumph. LBJ was now newsmagazine fodder.Caro makes a strong case that Johnson really had a compassionate heart, that his old connections to poor Mexicans touched him. And until he had real power, he couldn\u2019t exercise compassion.I am astonished at how much I have written in this review \u2013 and how much I have omitted. If you\u2019re thinking of reading this in hard copy, it weighs 4 \u00bd pounds.

Caro provides extended passages of background about a quarter of the book on the history of the Senate, from the great days of Webster, Clay and Calhoun to current times. He also went into detail about the architecture and seats in the Senate both before and after the War of 1812. Approximately half of the book covers in detail the epic battle over the 1957 Civil Rights Bill. Johnson\u2019s magic is the main subject of the book: how he made things happen in the U.S. Senate. Johnson\u2019s wheeling, threatening, stroking large egos, explaining why his goal was essential for the Country\u2018s good, he ran an institution that had never before been run by anyone.\u201cMaster of the Senate\u201d is the third volume of Caro\u2019s biography of Lyndon Johnson. I seem to be reading this series backwards as I started with Volume four. Caro presents a Johnson that is well rounded. We get to see him with all his warts and all, but also are given admiring recognition of all his accomplishments. Race was the great test for Johnson and the country during his years as Senate Majority leader 1955-61. Caro reveals the obstructed federal action on the cruel mistreatment of blacks in the South; no civil rights legislation had been enacted since 1875, at the end of the Reconstruction. For years after Johnson entered the Senate in 1949, he mostly voted with the Southerners. He chose as his mentor senator Richard Russell of Georgia, one of the most powerful men in the Senate. Johnson\u2019s friend Philip Graham, publisher of The Washington Post, kept telling Johnson he had to do something for civil rights. In 1957 President Eisenhower proposed Civil Rights Legislation. It appeared impossible to pass the legislation, but Johnson made it happen. Caro\u2019s description of how he did it is masterly. His strategy was to persuade the Southerners that is was in their best interest to let something labeled civil rights go through. The Eisenhower bill was focused on the right to vote, which the South denied the blacks by force and trickery. Johnson weakened the bill but if he didn\u2019t it would not pass. Johnson thought of it as a beginning as opening to further more meaningful legislation.Caro shows how Johnson learned the rules of the Senate and then used them. He then learned about the men in the Senate, their vanities, frailties and their weakness. He then sold himself to each as their friend, political adviser, their sounding board their Mr.-Fix-it. He also found a way to bridge the chasm between the Southern Democrats and the Northern liberals. The author goes into detail about the Olds Hearing. I will never again watch a Senate hearing without remembering what Johnson did to this man. Olds was up for re-confirmation of the Utilities commission and Johnson destroyed the man accusing him of being a communist just so he could obtain the favor and backing of the Texas gas and oil companies. Johnson organized a sneak attack and controlled the whole hearing so the man could not have the opportunity to refute the charges.Caro concludes that with the single exception of Lincoln, Johnson was the greatest white champion of blacks in American History. Grover Gardner does an excellent job narrating the book."}, {"userName": "Donna", "userReviewDate": "Dec 06, 2016", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/301807-donna", "userReview": "This is THE book of 2016.

Caro's research is detailed and embraces every aspect of the high points of Johnson's Senate career.

It was just as beautifully written as the first two volumes, but much larger in scope. Not necessarily in the time period covered, but in the background detail needed to truly understand Johnson\u2019s role in the Senate and how he transformed it. It is not an overstatement to say that Johnson became a \u201cmaster of the Senate.\u201dThroughout Caro's series on The Years of Lyndon Johnson, he presents a man with conflicting motivations, specifically, his desire to be powerful and reach the Presidency of the US and his compassion for the poor and downtrodden. Make no mistake, when the two are in conflict Johnson's ambition wins out, but the other is never far from the surface. This is abundantly clear in Johnson's civil rights record.I knew that during Johnson's presidency civil rights bills were passed in 1964 and 1965, but there was so much I didn't know. I didn't know that numerous bills had passed the House in the years leading up to the 60s, but they had all died in the Senate, largely due to the strong Southern leadership there. I also didn't know that there was a 1957 civil rights bill that came up in the Senate after Johnson had consolidated his power. But, this was a time when he was hoping to run for President in 1960 and had to somehow shed his reputation as being just another Southerner and at the same time retain the support of the South. Will he or won't he support the bill? How will he manage it? Will he let it come to the floor? Will it die in committee? This is where Caro's reputation for writing page-turners is seen clearly. If you have to know, I imagine you can find the answer in Wikipedia, but I'm not giving it away. I didn't know the answers and it made reading this part of the book really exciting. In order to understand the nuances of this fight, Caro gives a lot of background in this book - the workings of the Senate (which were so much more complicated than I realized), a history of civil rights in the US (a very thorough and well-written summary), and Johnson's relationships with the immensely powerful Southern bloc in the Senate. I found his mini-bio of Richard B Russell Jr. to be just as well done as his bio of Sam Rayburn in and earlier volume. He was the third \u201cR\u201d of Johnson\u2019s \u201cthree R\u2019s\u201d who helped him get to the Presidency \u2013 Roosevelt, Rayburn, and Russell.It is so hard to believe, as he says in the Acknowledgements, that his only help in researching this book came from his wife, Ina Caro.

The longest book (thus far) in the series, this covers Johnson's years in the Senate (1949-1961). Mainly, Caro focuses on the period from 1949 up to the passage of the Civil Rights Bill of 1957. During this time, Caro shows how Johnson rapidly accumulated power, becoming Minority Leader in 1953 while still a freshman Senator and only 44 years old. Johnson then bullied his way into being chosen as the Democrats' Majority Leader when they retook control of the Senate in 1955. One trademark of Caro's books is that he does not just focus on the main subject. So, the first 10% of this book is a retracing of the history of the Senate. Caro describes what the Founders wanted the Senate to be and how they specifically decided that its members would not be popularly elected. He goes on to describe a few of the famous battles between Henry Clay, John Calhoun, and Daniel Webster in the first half of the 19th century, a time when the Senate was sometimes the dominant part of the government. He also talks about the torpedoing of the League of Nations treaty by Henry Cabot Lodge in 1919 and 1920 and how the Senate destroyed Woodrow Wilson's dream of a global organization for peace. Caro goes in-depth in describing the culture of the Senate and how its members often think of themselves in a superior light; how Southerners accumulated power by grasping committee chairmanships and not letting go until forced to due to illness or death; and how the seniority system played into the hands of the Southerners in helping them obtain and horde these committee chairmanships. Caro goes into this level of detail to properly set the stage for when Johnson arrives as the junior Senator from Texas in January 1949. Johnson's ruthlessness is on display just like it was throughout the first two volumes. Caro continually writes of examples showing that Johnson would play people off against each other (in this volume, it was mainly Northerners vs Southerners in the Senate - Johnson would pretend with each group that he was on its side, telling its members what they wanted to hear; he would then say the exact opposite to the other group). \"The Johnson Treatment\" assumed full force during this period. Caro puts the reader inside the Democratic cloakroom as Johnson pins a Senator against a wall or in a plush couch and physically prevents the Senator from moving away from him as Johnson tries to persuade, cajole, or bully the Senator into voting the way that Johnson wanted him to. He also examines Johnson's decision to appease his wealthy Texas supporters like the Brown brothers by humiliating Leland Olds when Olds was up for renomination as Director of the Federal Power Commission. Olds had been appointed by FDR in 1939, and successfully renominated in 1944, so Olds was not expecting to have any issues. But Johnson's supporters did not like Olds's philosophy on electricity rate reforms. Johnson orchestrated what would now be called a smear campaign against Olds, falsely showcasing him as a Communist by unearthing bits and pieces of old writings that Olds had made in the 1920s. Johnson basically ruined him and his career as Olds struggled the rest of his life after leaving the FPC. Caro views Johnson as an opportunist and an ego-maniac. He lusts after power wherever he goes. He wanted to control the Senate and bend Senators to his will. Johnson was obsessed also with running for the presidency, and he saw the Senate as a stepping-stone to achieving that goal. Caro has unearthed such a large amount first-hand knowledge of Johnson through all of the interviews that he has conducted over the past forty years. Reading this, you are transported back to Johnson's world of the 1950s - his chain-smoking that helped result in a massive heart attack in 1955, his ambivalence and waffling on civil rights (until he judged that the time was right for him to try to obtain credit for passing a bill, watered-down as it was), his continued cruel disregard of Lady Bird, and his life being totally consumed by the Senate to the detriment of his daughters. In Volume I, Caro spotlighted Sam Rayburn and made him a major part of that book. In this volume, it is Georgia Senator Richard Russell. Once again, Caro digs deep into Russell's background to help provide context to the reader. Johnson would not have been able to amass the power that he did without Russell's constant backing. Caro does treat Russell fairly: scouring him for his bigotry and racism, while also pointing out how he was crucial in slowing down the euphoria over General Douglas MacArthur's return in 1951 after being fired by President Truman. Russell was concerned about the functioning of the federal government in this case as he did not like the vitriol that Truman was subjected to, and he thought it could potentially get out of hand. So he effectively put the brakes on this boom during drawn-out Armed Services Committee hearings. A large section of the book deals with passage of the 1957 Civil Rights Act. As noted above, Johnson really tried to play both sides here - convincing Southerners that he was anti-civil rights, while telling the Northerners that the time had come to help blacks be able to register to vote in the South. Caro does give Johnson credit for being able to get any kind of bill to pass, based on how racist the Southern Senators were, and how most of them controlled key committees, including the Judiciary Committee. It was fascinating to read through all of the various twists and turns that the legislation took, and how hard Johnson worked to ultimately get the bill passed. Unfortunately, the bill really did not help alleviate the awful discrimination that most blacks faced in the South. Caro ends by talking about Johnson's pathetic attempt to hold onto power (and office space) in the Senate after he was elected Vice President. Johnson was quickly chagrined to discover that the Senators no longer eagerly sought his advice and approval before they did anything, and that as Vice President, he was no longer privy to being involved in behind-the-scenes matters in the Senate. As Johnson so often did, he deluded himself into thinking that he would still have total control over people that he had dominated for most of the prior decade."}, {"userName": "Jared Gaby-Biegel", "userReviewDate": "Aug 08, 2017", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/68862347-jared-gaby-biegel", "userReview": "Really, really good.

I began reading it in mid-November, 2017, mostly at the rate of 10 pages a day. I renewed it at the library as many times as allowed and finished it in a blaze of power reading 120 pages in two days. It is dense and sometimes repetitive. I feel like I have done a semester of Ivy League college level political science with Robert Caro as the professor. I am not however going to write a term paper!Yet it was so worth reading. I am a wiser person for it. The whole experience of the three volumes I have now read has given me an understanding of a subject I never thought I even wanted to learn: American politics. Caro grabbed my lazy fiction reading mind by the lobes and dragged me kicking and screaming into an awareness of how democracy plays out in the United States federal government. I have always thought it was a dirty game and I still do, but when my country supposedly elected Donald Trump as POTUS, I knew I needed more knowledge if I was not going to become an anxiety-ridden old woman. Thank you Mr Caro.Master of the Senate covers Johnson's 12 years in the Senate. Caro opens the book with a full 100 pages on the history of the Senate, another chunk of knowledge I had never considered. Seriously, our education system would do well to figure out a way to teach kids about all this while making it interesting and comprehensible.After LBJ literally stole the election to become senator from Texas, he went on to learn hard lessons himself about how that body operated. At first, his old tricks were not working for him in such a hidebound, staid institution. Though Caro does not see the man as particularly ethical or principled, he does portray him as a political genius. That being the kind of genius needed to be a chess champion, with an ability to see the game many moves ahead and to read your opponent. Similar skills are also helpful in certain games of gambling. Finally, a good dose of ruthless determination to win, an understanding of publicity and the press, and very little moral compunction are required.LBJ had and did all that. In the process he single handedly changed the way the Senate worked, from a lethargic men's club into a wheeling dealing den of influence and trade offs. The man wanted to be President of the United States. Since he was essentially a Southern Democrat, he had a big problem to solve in those days and you can read all about how he solved it in this book.All along in the earlier volumes and through most of this one, Caro had painted an unflattering picture of his subject but curiously, near the end of Master of the Senate, he seems to be changing his tune. He seeks to explain how this fairly despicable character actually gained a reputation for being a champion of Civil Rights. I was not wholly convinced.At the end of the book, LBJ is about to enter the 1960 Democratic convention for the second time as a presidential candidate. The fourth volume, The Passage of Power, will tell how he came out of that as Vice President to John F Kennedy, thereby losing nearly all of the power he had built up as Majority Leader of the Senate and then, by a simple twist of fate, became President after the assassination.I am eager to read all that and to learn how he went on to create the Great Society. Perhaps I too will come to admire the man. But not yet. I have been inside the mastermind of this tragic figure off and on for almost a year. I am taking a break.

Johnson and the one which won a second Pulitzer Prize for Caro. It deals with Johnson's time in the Senate from 1949 until the election of 1960. Worth the price of admission alone, are the first few chapters which give a succinct but comprehensive history of the United States Senate from its inception until Johnson's elevation to Majority Leader. Caro describes the Founders' original intent in creating this Body to be one that took its time in deciding issues to give a \"cooling off\" period over laws that may have been passed in haste in the House. He discusses the power of committee chairmen, the filibuster and the South's virtual lock on the Senate post-Civil War due to the seniority system. He also discusses how they were unable to have a southerner elected President and their strong desire to do so which so affected Johnson's later career. This careful preparation in the beginning chapters gives the reader a much greater understanding of how Lyndon Johnson came to wield such enormous power so quickly.This volume also enlarges the picture of Johnson begun in the first two books. He is still the same personally, self-involved, arrogant, rude, boorish, and sometimes cruel beyond understanding. He has also by this time reached the apex of political understanding and ability that allowed him to reap enormous power from his position as Majority Leader and to rule the Senate as no one before him ever had. I can't emphasize enough how well Robert Caro tells this story. This is political history that reads like a novel. Factual, informative, and well written, Mr. Caro writes the story of these clashes from the 50's with real tension. Even when you know the outcomes, you find yourself keeping the vote count as eagerly as Johnson himself did. Caro spends another few chapters towards the last giving the same kind of mini history lesson on the history of civil rights from the Civil War Amendments up to the passage in 1957 of the first civil rights legislation since 1875. The way that this law was brought to be by Johnson's manipulations is remarkable and fascinating as is this entire volume."}, {"userName": "Judy", "userReviewDate": "Jun 28, 2012", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/854592-judy", "userReview": "I really liked the first two volumes in Caro's life of Lyndon Baines Johnson, Means of Ascent and The Path to Power, but this third volume was definitely the best of the three. Here, Caro focuses on Lyndon Johnson during the Senate years from 1949, when he first entered the Senate, until 1960 when he was elected Vice President. Caro continues to portray Johnson as an extremely complex individual. One side of the man was a Machiavellian bully intent on furthering his own interests through the trading of political favors, the use of charm, arm-twisting, deal-making, deal-breaking, blustering, and even some physical intimidation. The other side of the man was a study in the use of power in the Senate and how Johnson, the youngest Majority Leader in U.S. history, was able to guide the Civil Rights Act of 1957 through the chamber. That legislation was the first Civil Rights bill to pass through the Congress since Reconstruction and Johnson used his grasp of the complex parliamentary hurdles that exist within the Senate to secure enough votes to finally pass this historic piece of legislation. In great detail, Caro describes the committe and subcommittee structures and the powers that exist for each as well as the parlimentary procedures that Johnson used to his advantage.

This book is super long. To me, that's a good thing, but there are parts which are slightly repetitive (and in a way, that's to be expected in such a complex minutely researched behemoth of a book). Another minor quibble (and Caro has done this in his other works) is that he can be a little judgmental, bashing you over the head time and time again about such and such character's flaws, personal shortcomings, etc. Sometimes I'm not sure if he's exaggerating things, demonizing or lionizing people unfairly or not.

Once the most august and revered body in politics, by the time Johnson arrived the Senate had become a parody of itself and an obstacle that for decades had blocked desperately needed liberal legislation. Caro shows how Johnson\u2019s brilliance, charm, and ruthlessness enabled him to become the youngest and most powerful Majority Leader in history and how he used his incomparable legislative genius--seducing both Northern liberals and Southern conservatives--to pass the first Civil Rights legislation since Reconstruction. Brilliantly weaving rich detail into a gripping narrative, Caro gives us both a galvanizing portrait of Johnson himself and a definitive and revelatory study of the workings of legislative power.", "title": "Master of the Senate\n      \n          (The Years of Lyndon Johnson #3)", "url": "http://www.goodreads.com/book/show/86525.Master_of_the_Senate", "average": 4.42, "cover": "https://images.gr-assets.com/books/1388189118l/86525.jpg", "reviews": 644, "authors": [{"url": "https://www.goodreads.com/author/show/722.Robert_A_Caro", "name": "Robert A.
