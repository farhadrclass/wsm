You may not agree. This book is awful! If it were a movie, I should have walked out hours ago. Instead, I just wanted to know what happens. And when I actually got to the end of the book about 3 minutes ago, it wasn't even a very good ending!! It took 350 pages to build up to an anti-climactic ending.Why is it awful? The author uses every opportunity to throw in a foul word or sexual comment. It's like he's a 14-year-old boy who thinks it's fun to talk about being naked or private parts, etc. I got so tired of reading cuss words and the nakedness was such a ridiculous element of the story - so forced! Also, it had, in my estimation, sexually explicit scenes that I don't need to be reading.I won't be reading anything by Orson Scott Card again."}, {"userName": "Melissa", "userReviewDate": "Apr 09, 2008", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/391444-melissa", "userReview": "I almost really loved this book. However, for me it suffers from the same problem that other Orson Scott Card books do...the characters (not the Ender's series but his other books). The plot of this book is truly brilliant. It is very creative and fun and imaginative. It is a great story but the characters...oh, help us. They just aren't all that great. I mean they say the things they should say and do the things they should do but I think the author is lacking in his ability to tap into the subtle and amazing things that make us human. He is especially bad with the characterization of women. This book is no different. I just never really liked Ivan or Katerina and had a hard time believing they could be in love or even real people for that matter because they lack depth. Also, this book had a few less dignified moments. They are just dumb. It's like those Disney movies that add in burps or the letting of gas to appeal to the nine year old boys. Really, I don't even think grown-up men find that stuff funny unless they are talking about when they were young and did it to someone else."}, {"userName": "Steph", "userReviewDate": "Jan 05, 2008", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/679287-steph", "userReview": "Days before young Ivan's family moved out of Russia, he stumbled upon something terrifying and magical during a walk in the forest. Frightened, he ran. Years later, while visiting his childhood home, he finds himself drawn to the same clearing, only this time, he stumbles unwillingly into the midst of an unfolding drama for events that happened--are happening--hundreds of years earlier.Readers of fairy tales and Russian mythology will appreciate how Card carefully yet effortlessly works familiar names and creatures into the story, tying the medieval world to the present day, and imbuing both with magic.However, the tropes common to the fairy tales we're familiar with don't exactly apply here. The fair princess awakens, not to love at first sight of her hero, but to disappointment and disdain. The hero does not charge into danger out of a sense of duty, but rather falls into another world, flailing to recover his sense of self and find his way home. Flawed and interesting characters, echoes of familiar stories, and a strong sense of the fantastical make this a book worth picking up."}, {"userName": "Alysia", "userReviewDate": "Jan 18, 2008", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/799632-alysia", "userReview": "This is one book that my husband and I both enjoy and love to read together over and over. One of our favorites. It is a modern day Sleeping Beauty story, but it doesn't end when he wakes her up. Instead, the couple goes through the struggles of getting to know and understand eachother, including trying understand eachother's cultures, which are hundreds of years apart. They must learn how to love eachother and support eachother in trials and danger (which includes being chased through time and space by the witch that put the spell on her), finding their place in their new families, and learning how to make marriage work. Please note: I would not give this book to teens or kids, because of a brief scene and references to married sexuality, but those were not offensive to us as a married couple as they are tastefully done and important to the story."}, {"userName": "Lindsy", "userReviewDate": "Jan 18, 2008", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/564359-lindsy", "userReview": "On the surface this book sounds great. Fairytales, fantasy, basis in actual folklore type stuff; it's even decently written.However I found the characters so unlikable that the story was ruined for me. The main character abandons a fiancee that he was very happy with...*until* he met the princess. How..quaint and realistic. I hope you can detect the sarcasm. The mother is bordering on cruel to the previous fiancee. I do think the personalities and relationship, for the most part, were interpreted well and resembled realism. I just didn't care.The early events in the book made it nearly impossible for me to appreciate any of the remaining story, because the characters were so reprehensible to me, I didn't really care what happened to them.As most other reviewers have said it is a wonderful fantasy/fairytale romance and I would not have even minded the less appealing qualities of the characters if they had been used to show dynamics and growth. Instead I was asked to accept those faults as traits to be admired.In the end, despite the sweet, though simple narrative and the broad range of topics explored, the story just fell flat."}, {"userName": "Julie", "userReviewDate": "Jul 19, 2010", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/1432709-julie", "userReview": "As we outgrow our childhood, we say goodbye to many fun traditions. No longer do we believe in the Easter Bunny or hope that the Tooth Fairy will bring us gifts in the night (although some financial assistance for crowns and wisdom teeth extractions would be nice). With adulthood, we stop reading books that begin with \u201cOnce upon a time\u2026 \u201d. But, some days, when work is, well work, and newspapers are filled with stories about the bad economy, a fairy tale seems like the perfect escape from the real world. And better than anything that Calgon has to offer, listening to the audio version of Orson Scott Card\u2019s Enchantment, can really take your mind away.Running through the forest in Russia, 10-year old Ivan finds a beautiful sleeping woman who is magically frozen in time. Not fully believing what he sees, but still sensing danger, Ivan flees the clearing. Soon after, his family moves to the United States. Over a decade later, Ivan, now fully Westernized, returns to Russia to complete his research of Russian folklore for his graduate thesis. Although he has never mentioned it to anyone, the scene in the forest has haunted him and he returns to banish this hopefully imaginary event from his mind. Instead, he discovers the beautiful Princess Katerina, who has been asleep under a spell for hundreds of years. Ivan breaks the spell and awakens the princess with a kiss. Now all of us recognize this as the end of that classic, Sleeping Beauty, but where Disney\u2019s story ends, Enchantment is just beginning to take off. This magical fairy tale transports Ivan to 9th century Russia where Ivan must save Katerina and her kingdom from the evil Russian witch, Baba Yaga. In Enchantment, Orson Scott Card has created an unusual meld of fairy tale and Russian mythology with modern day action and suspense. Part of the humor and fun in the story is the combination of medieval culture with present day society. Ivan\u2019s advanced education, intelligence and lean physique might be a magnet for women in the 20th century, but do not impress Princess Katerina, who expects men to be brawny and able to wield a broad sword, not a quill and parchment. Unlike the traditional fairy tale, the princess does not wake from her thousand year slumber in love with the man who has broken the spell. Her disdain for Ivan and the tension and sparring between the two heroes of this story add romance and humor to this charming fairy tale. Throw in some exciting and clever plot twists and you have a performance that appeals to both romance lovers and adventure addicts \u2013 the perfect audio book for a long car trip with someone special..Although the book originally published in print in 1999, the audio version was recently released in 2010 by Blackstone. The combination of magical fantasy and fast paced suspense make this a superb story to enjoy in audio. Orson Scott Card shifts the point of view several times during the book, giving the reader the opportunity to hear the story from eight different people including Ivan, the princess, and even the wicked Baba Yaga. This Blackstone production features two award winning narrators, Stefan Rudnicki and Gabrielle de Cuir, who make the transition between the various points of view seamless. Both narrators give stellar performances, switching often between American, Russian and Yiddish accents. The audio book is lengthy \u2013 over 17 hours \u2013 but Rudnicki\u2019s soothing bass voice and de Cuir\u2019s incredible performance as both the young heroine Katerina and the old crone Baba Yaga will have you savoring every moment. So, if life gets too hectic and you need to escape in a fairy tale, or if you are just in the mood for a well told story filled with magic, romance, and adventure, pamper yourself with this beautiful story \u2013 you\u2019ll be enchanted!"}, {"userName": "Julie", "userReviewDate": "Oct 29, 2007", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/585566-julie", "userReview": "This book was unbelievably clever, A professional runner studying dead languages - happens to take an internship... being about the only person in the entire world who could survive what happens to him.The thought of reading ancient stories and having them be about your mom, or dad, or something that's happening to you right now...The politics and religion of the ancient world were genius - and critical to suck a reader in to believe the situation is plausible.

Another quality effort by Orson Scott Card.

The stuff in old Rus was far more interesting. This could just be a personal thing, but I don't really like deconstructions of legends. This veers a bit close to that by offering some \"cute\" explanations for the some of the staples of Russian fairy tales like the hut on chicken feet and Ivan the Idiot.

Imagine my surprise when this book picked up more or less where the last had left off \u2013 in the Soviet Union (albeit the 1970\u2019s, not post-war). I got to the enchanted forest eventually, but it took a couple of chapters.The book is a fusion of the fairy tales of Sleeping Beauty and Baba Yaga, the baby-eating witch of Russian folklore. Our handsome prince is Ivan, a Jewish boy born in the Soviet Union who defects to America with his family at age ten and returns to the Ukraine as a grad student after the fall of communism. The sleeping beauty he awakens from her millennium-long dream is Princess Katerina, but before they can live happily ever after, they have to go back to the 9th century and defeat Baba Yaga. The book is action-packed, romantic, and thoroughly addictive, but from the point of view of a religious Jew, it\u2019s absolutely worth skipping.The main problem with the book \u2013 surprise, surprise \u2013 are it\u2019s inaccuracies in its portrayal of Jews. Princess Katerina lives in the period when Christianity was first gaining a foothold in Europe, and I have no trouble believing that she and her subjects pray and confess like Christians yet still dabble in witchcraft and occasionally invoke the names of pagan gods. Old habits die hard. But Jews were never pagans. Tanach is full of warnings to the Jews to stop their idol worship, but that was in the ancient period. When Prince Casmir invited the Jews to Poland, he allowed them religious freedom, and thus grew the very insular communities of Eastern European Jewry. The pagan beliefs of their neighbors were no temptation for Jews, so all plot twists with Ivan and his family simply did not ring true. Orson Scott Card, himself a Mormon, probably doesn\u2019t know the difference, but any religious Jew would, and most would find the Jewish characters offensive.I think I\u2019m going to create a new shelf called \u201cRegrettable Reads.\u201d The addictively good writing of this book deserves at least a 4, but for the portrayal of the Jews, it loses one, and even that may be too little.

I love anything that has to do with Russia so that was an added bonus! When I was learning Russian my teacher told me about Baba Yaga (this scary witch woman from old Russian folk tales) and she is in this book as a character so that was pretty interesting.Also, there are a lot of times I was pissed at Katarina for the shit she put Ivan through. If I were him I would've just kicked her in the shin and freaking booked it back to the future. Nevertheless, I still liked the book and would recommend it to most people. There's a lot of crude jokes in it (which I though was funny considering I assumed(wrongly) that this was an Ender's Game-type young adult book of Card's) but you can overlook most of them.Audiobook caveats: I dozed off a couple times during the Baba Yaga sections of the book-->The woman reading her sections was good at the narrative voice and the witch but her voice as the bear was ridiculous.

Unlike most other OSC books, I had not reread it . . . until now.The problem is, that even though it is a marvelously written book, and I usually enjoy retellings/retoolings of old fairy tales, I find Enchantment very disturbing.I know perfectly well why Ivan is Jewish: in 1970s Russia, it was certainly the easiest way to end up a refusenik! And what other non-Christian would make any sense in pre-1000 Russia? I get all of that. It makes perfect sense in the book's context.But it means that I am meant to root for Ivan's marriage to Katerina, and against poor Ruthie. To root for a marriage that makes all his children non-Jews, completely lost to the Jewish people. (Not to mention be ok with his conversion to Christianity.)Somehow, I can't imagine OSC ever making a character Mormon as a plot point.So on the one hand, I would give this book 4 stars; and on the other point, I would give it 1.

There were elements I loved - the slight skewing of fairy tale, and the contrast between the modern world and the ancient world makes for unlimited writing fodder. As always, Card's use of enchantment and sorcery is charming. The anthropologist in me loved the discovery of ancient language and early writing. The story was definitely good.What I didn't like is that in many areas it read like a romance novel. The are sections of the book where the constant inner dialog of the angst of love was quite wearisome. She despises me... Can I ever love him... blah, blah, blah. It got old fast. It's why I don't read romances. Again, perhaps the editor should have been more involved. The novel would be better with some judicious cuts.

A mediocre retelling of fairy and folk tales (mostly from Russia) this book was cliche, drawn out, and often boring.

Complete with crashing a jetplane in the past (explaining Baba Yaga folk tale with her flying chicken legged house.)While the retelling of folk tales in this book are interesting and arguably well woven, the overall book just didn't work.

A nice end AND start to the years :D And I was hooked in straight away, there was no gradual warming up - I loved it from the start. The writing is just so delicious, and the tale itself so rich and wonderful... the perfect mix of fairy-tale fantasy and darkness. I LOVED the language geekery so much as well, that was utter brilliance. And the snappy banter between Bear and Baba Yaga often made me laugh out loud... such enjoyable villains! Although you really can't help but like Bear, he's just been suckered into one of her spells. Baba Yaga is bloody terrifying. But so awesome. Dude, she HIJACKED A PLANE AND FLEW IT BACK TO THE NINTH CENTURY. I mean, who even DOES that?! And Katerina freaking rocked as well. She was so much better than Ruth... there was just no contest. You can't even really feel sorry for Ruth, losing Ivan so abruptly. She's got nothing on Katerina. I adored her - she's a princess, the sleeping beauty whom Ivan awakens... but she's not a simpering, fragile little thing. Oh hell no! She's feisty and strong and stubborn and a little bit snarky and arrogant. So much fun :D I loved the romance between her and Ivan. You know it's going to happen eventually, but it's all done so nicely and at such a gentle pace that it doesn't feel forced or sudden or anything. Just natural.I loved both times in this book equally - Katerina in the 20th century, Ivan in the 9th. Usually I much favour one over the other, but these were both done so brilliantly. The gorgeous historicalness of the 9th and the language geekery, contrasted so nicely to that fun culture-clash which happens when someone is shifted forward in time. And it was fun to have all of the recent day Russian politics in the background as well, an interesting touch.Uncle Marek's true identity came as a huge surprise. I love how everything wove together like that. :) I loved how Ivan managed to beat Bear to get to the princess. I loved the humour that was always there. I loved the author snarking about JFK airport twice within the space of like five pages:\"...and the six-mile walk down tubes and ramps before they got to the airplanes, which apparently parked in Sag Harbour.\"\"Some of the same clerks were on duty, watching Ivan and Katerina very carefully, but treating them with more politeness than usual, which, at Kennedy, isn't a hard standard to surpass.\"LOL BURN.Totally can't fault this in any way... only that it had to finish at all :)"}, {"userName": "Amy", "userReviewDate": "Feb 13, 2017", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/2329228-amy", "userReview": "This book came highly recommended, but for the life of me I can't remember who recommended it. Based on my friends' reviews, not someone on Goodreads. Enchantment certainly had potential. I was bored by the beginning but intrigued by the idea of the plot, so I kept reading. I enjoyed the middle but grew bored again and tired of the characters. Finally I reached the end where I conclude...it wasn't bad. But it wasn't a book I needed to read. This isn't one of those classics you force yourself through and then feel like a better person for reading. It was a creative fairy-tale that blends history and culture but never quite rises to the level of being really interesting. The switching POVs helped but the hero and heroine remain rather bland and perfect. I liked Esther and I appreciate that the story doesn't reveal all of its secrets...but in not revealing them, it also leaves a lot of conveniently timed things unexplained. At 415 pages, I think this book is too long and not interesting enough to even be worth recommending.

It was fun to delve again into the minds of Katarina and Ivan and recognize the beautiful difference between men and woman. I found myself thinking of my marriage and how I use words to heal or hurt those I care about. I love this story. Not only is it a fabulous retelling of Sleeping Beauty, but it is beautiful commentary on the power and magic that can exist in marriage between a man and a woman. So I love returning to some of my favorite stories, and just like the first time, this story did not disappoint. I haven't read a lot of Card's stories, but the ones that I have, I love. Like I said in my earlier review, this is a modern/fantasy/in the past mix of Sleeping Beauty. Card's writing is beautiful and unique from beginnig to end. I loved all the funny details about the differences of men and women, and especially loved the process of falling in love. It doesn't just begin with waking up from a kiss. Loved it!This is a retelling of Sleeping Beauty, but so originally told that the story stands alone by itself. It is influenced by Jewish and Russian folktales.

Loved both the book & the audio.NOTE ABOUT AUTHOR-MY PERSONAL BELIEFSI'd also like to add that I realize OSC has made some homophobic public statements and certainly doesn't come across as very tolerant.#1 - while the author is LDS (Mormon), his harsh words do not reflect what our church leaders teach us about kindness and love towards others. Pointed council has been given to members about treatment of LGBT, so OSC is not an example to look to for acceptable Mormon behavior. #2 - read this book, despite the fact that OSC said mean things. Borrow it from the library if you don't feel good about supporting the author, but reading it doesn't = agreeing with him. It makes no sense to deprive yourself of the supreme pleasure of this story just because a cranky guy created it - if OSC offered me a twenty dollar bill, I'd like take it in a heartbeat.

Unfortunately these tend to be overlooked as readers are so enamored of the Ender series. Consequently Enchantment is unjustly less than famous.As the title suggest, this is a fantasy novel. The story is based on the original Russian version of Sleeping Beauty, folk tales, and some Slavic history. Card's writing is always crystal clear and elegant, none of the chopped up sentences so beloved by William Gibson fans. The characterization, the pace, the use of magic and spells is first rate. Most of the book takes place in our world, but is no less magical for that. I love it when the magical world intrudes upon our world, the sort of thing you get in urban fantasy.While the story is less than epic in scope I still had an absolute blast with this book.

Ivan Smetski returns to his childhood home of Ukraine for some research and relaxation. While on a run, he seeks out a meadow in a forest he once came upon as a child. To his surprise, the woman he saw lying asleep on a pedestal all those years ago was not a figment of his imagination. After defeating a bear that guards \"sleeping beauty,\" Ivan kisses her and she awakens. From there on out, the looming threat of a wicked witch forces Ivan and Princess Katerina to cross between the 1990s and the 9th Century. Their hope is to defeat the witch and bring safety to Katerina\u2019s village, but stating that their task is difficult is an understatement -- let's just say that Ivan and Katerina don\u2019t exactly hit it off when she awakens from his kiss.I can\u2019t say that all fantasy fiction is for me, but this book can be credited with my newfound appreciation for the genre. What drew me to the novel was Card\u2019s ability to merge modern, non-fantastical elements with fantasy themes. He presents both a scholarly dialogue on Russian fairytales from Ivan\u2019s perspective as a graduate student, and seamlessly blends this into the storyline taking place within Katerina\u2019s world. This balance between \"real\" and \"fantasy\" keeps the novel from being too much for my taste. Clever and sarcastic dialogue also adds to the appeal making the book a pretty funny read."}, {"userName": "Abeer Hoque", "userReviewDate": "Aug 23, 2012", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/82829-abeer-hoque", "userReview": "I listened to Enchantment by Orson Scott Card (of Ender's Game fame - still one of my favourite books) on audiobook, because I had some long trips coming up. It wasn't a book I had been wanting to read (random pick from the library), but it filled the time quite easily, and I found out that I like to listen to audiobooks while running - yay for multitasking! Enchantment had a promising premise - a modern retelling of the Sleeping Beauty saga. However, it quickly becomes an ordinary but well researched, structured, and paced story about magic and witches in an otherwise muggle world. I will never forget the deep forest with its leaf-filled chasm in the Ukraine where our runner scholar hero, Ivan, finds his 9th century princess Katerina. For that gorgeous magical place alone, I'm grateful. Otherwise, the characters were flat and often stereotypical, and the story not as inventive as I had hoped."}, {"userName": "Rachel", "userReviewDate": "Nov 21, 2013", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/1722964-rachel", "userReview": "I started this book on the recommendation of a friend, who commented that the author's biases were rather restrained here. I cannot agree with this statement.I gave up on this book on a plane when my next book was out of reach. I couldn't take any more of the Madonna/whore view of women or the unlikeable characters (hero, heroine, minor characters...). When I gave up, frustrated with all of them, it was because I realized that the character I empathized with most and the one I wanted to succeed was the villain.You know, the one committing bestiality. The author set her up as a survivor early on, and... somehow all the other major characters were less empathetic and less interesting. Esther may get to be a stronger character in the second half, but I am not sticking around to find out."}, {"userName": "Jennifer Lawrence", "userReviewDate": "Dec 04, 2009", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/2183976-jennifer-lawrence", "userReview": "I only got through a third of this book before I quit (which is really hard for me because even if a book is bad I usually finish it). I just realized that I was wasting my time. The story started out cool but as I got into the book I found myself caring less and less about all the one dimensional characters which in turn made the book meaningless. Some of the characters and dialogue was offensive so when I added it all up together I decided to move on."}, {"userName": "Karin", "userReviewDate": "Apr 25, 2008", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/953867-karin", "userReview": "I was waiting to add this to my books until I read it again, but I saw it, so I'm adding it now. I would say that this is one of my favorite novels. I love Card's story-telling and this has a wonderful yarn to spin. :-) The story of Sleeping Beauty with a modern day twist. I adored how he weaved in all of the religious aspects (and there were several). I've read it several times and plan to read it several more."}, {"userName": "Megan", "userReviewDate": "Oct 01, 2008", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/962802-megan", "userReview": "At first I was confused by the story of a Ukranian boy converting to Judaism and how it would deal with fairy tales. As soon as the real story started to take place, I was hooked. It was so interesting to read a fairy tale written by Scott Card. It's very nitty-gritty, not so glossed over as most fairy tales, and very compelling. It was such a disfuntional love story that it was so much more true and all the better in the end."}], "description": "In Enchantment, Card works his magic as never before, transforming the timeless story of Sleeping Beauty into an original fantasy brimming with romance and adventure.The moment Ivan stumbled upon a clearing in the dense Carpathian forest, his life was forever changed. Atop a pedestal encircled by fallen leaves, the beautiful princess Katerina lay still as death. But beneath the foliage a malevolent presence stirred and sent the ten-year-old Ivan scrambling for the safety of Cousin Marek's farm.Now, years later, Ivan is an American graduate student, engaged to be married. Yet he cannot forget that long-ago day in the forest--or convince himself it was merely a frightened boy's fantasy. Compelled to return to his native land, Ivan finds the clearing just as he left it.This time he does not run. This time he awakens the beauty with a kiss . . . and steps into a world that vanished a thousand years ago.A rich tapestry of clashing worlds and cultures, Enchantment is a powerfully original novel of a love and destiny that transcend centuries . . . and the dark force that stalks them across the ages.From the Hardcover edition.", "title": "Enchantment", "url": "http://www.goodreads.com/book/show/7973.Enchantment", "average": 3.89, "cover": "https://images.gr-assets.com/books/1388707953l/7973.jpg", "reviews": 2286, "authors": [{"url": "https://www.goodreads.com/author/show/589.Orson_Scott_Card", "name": "Orson Scott Card"}], "type": ["Fantasy", "Fiction", "Fantasy", "Romance", "Science Fiction Fantasy"], "outlinks": ["http://www.goodreads.com/book/show/7973.Enchantment", "http://www.goodreads.com/book/show/8529657-enchantment", "http://www.goodreads.com/book/show/16638647-enchantment", "http://www.goodreads.com/book/show/761235.Enchantment", "http://www.goodreads.com/book/show/17607441-zaklet", "http://www.goodreads.com/book/show/160966.Enchantment", "http://www.goodreads.com/book/show/375802.Ender_s_Game", "http://www.goodreads.com/book/show/7967.Speaker_for_the_Dead", "http://www.goodreads.com/book/show/9532.Ender_s_Shadow", "http://www.goodreads.com/book/show/8648.Xenocide", "http://www.goodreads.com/book/show/31360.Children_of_the_Mind", "http://www.goodreads.com/book/show/19755140-embassytown", "http://www.goodreads.com/book/show/32858845-off-to-be-the-wizard", "http://www.goodreads.com/book/show/33616599-beneath-the-shine", "http://www.goodreads.com/book/show/10931746-the-stepford-wives", "http://www.goodreads.com/book/show/22583196-time-s-divide", "http://www.goodreads.com/book/show/13604418-the-long-earth", "http://www.goodreads.com/book/show/20526820-gilded", "http://www.goodreads.com/book/show/26580636-infinity-lost", "http://www.goodreads.com/book/show/34111309-the-man-of-legends", "http://www.goodreads.com/book/show/31139576-all-the-breaking-waves", "http://www.goodreads.com/book/show/40193375-fellside", "http://www.goodreads.com/book/show/18108877-timebound", "http://www.goodreads.com/book/show/25071002-the-banished-of-muirwood", "http://www.goodreads.com/book/show/40204943-muirwood", "http://www.goodreads.com/book/show/18806963-prayers-to-broken-stones", "http://www.goodreads.com/book/show/18126623-2061", "http://www.goodreads.com/book/show/29425329-alas-babylon", "http://www.goodreads.com/book/show/40193696-3001", "http://www.goodreads.com/book/show/40205002-fractured", "http://www.goodreads.com/book/show/29103028-the-queen-s-poisoner", "http://www.goodreads.com/book/show/40269681-zeroes", "http://www.goodreads.com/book/show/9409759-powers", "http://www.goodreads.com/book/show/38213061-leviathan-wakes", "http://www.goodreads.com/book/show/18162904-dreams-and-shadows", "http://www.goodreads.com/book/show/36316055-touch-of-eternity", "http://www.goodreads.com/book/show/35106805-touch", "http://www.goodreads.com/book/show/40192858-dragon-rider", "http://www.goodreads.com/book/show/23249416-an-unwelcome-quest"]}
