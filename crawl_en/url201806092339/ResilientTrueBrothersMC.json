I took a chance with the first book in the series, Ruthless, as it was a new MC series and we all know how those can go sometimes. I am so glad I did as I ended up truly enjoying Zeb and Jessica\u2019s story. I also enjoyed the second installment in the series. Now, with this book, we get Tank\u2019s story. Yay!This was a sweet romance with an alpha-male biker going after the sweet, yet feisty, heroine. I loved the fact that this hard-edged biker managed to show a softer side and allowed his resilient walls to be penetrated. Also, Nicole was the sweetness that Tank craved as she manages to push past his defenses. They were both what the other needed. Told in dual POVs, the premise for this book was definitely well thought out and I did enjoy the elements to the storyline. Similar to book one in the series, I felt like this is not a dark, gritty and raw MC book and I was truly ok with that. There is a lot going on plot wise which kept my attention. The focus of the story was definitely the sweet romance between Tank and Nicole. I did enjoy the secondary aspects to the overall story arc and loved getting to know the True Brothers a little more. You definitely get the sense that these biker men truly are a family who may have some scrupulous morals but are there for their brethren. Ms. Archer continues to do a wonderful job setting the back drop to this MC world and giving us more on all the characters. Resilient is most definitely a recommended read!***An advance reading copy of Resilient by Gillian Archer was generously provided to me in exchange for an honest review."}, {"userName": "Eve Recinella (Between The Bookends)", "userReviewDate": "Apr 07, 2017", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/921083-eve-recinella-between-the-bookends", "userReview": "I really like this cover. How guy that is a good representation of the hero. Interesting title work and good compostition.I enjoyed the previous book in the series so I was looking forward to digging into this one. Alas, it just wasn't all that great for me.The writing was excellent. This author has a very readable way of writing. The pace was good as well and kept me turning the pages. Nicole and Tank had some funny moments. There wasn't any OW/OM drama. I wouldn't even say there was a lot of angst. I LOVED Tank and his badass alpha ways, and it was nice (mostly) seeing the couples from the previous books.So what didn't work? Practically EVERYONE in this book was either mean or acted like a bitch. I didn't like Nicole AT ALL. Yes, I get she had issues with bikers, but seriously she was just WAY too judgy twat considering her best friends were in love with bikers. And let's talk about those friends shall we? Jessica was AWFUL in this book. I get she was supposed to be a bridezilla, but people needed to tell her to shut the f@ck up!I also wasn't a fan of the direction the author chose to go in concerning a particular pair.

Nothing against the main characters, but it still made me cry. Besides that the only thing I didn't care for was the couples need to keep things from going serious at first. They stayed loyal to each other, but was in complete denial for the first half of the book. Once they got over that bull, I truly enjoyed this couple together.

He had his issues, but just had a really big heart. I loved in the story how he just would say it like it is, but then just get all flustered with Nicole after. He was hot sexy and sweet, but still the king of the castle. My heart went out to him with his PTSD flashbacks. I really didn't like Nicole at first, she based her view of people too much on her past and not just assume about the people in her present.

There were some pretty hilarious scenes. That scene in the car? When Tank and Nicole were taunting and teasing each other was like, the cutest thing ever. I'd say the book started off at the light side and then started becoming a little intense. I loved the bad boy attitude with Tank. He's a biker, could he be more badass than that? What I didn't find satisfying enough is the characters' backgrounds. We didn't get to actually meet Austin, for example. And I think there are things that were left unsettled at the end. We didn't get closure with Tank's sister, and I'm a closure-obsessed person here. I loved the club, but it felt like when Nicole was there, especially at the end, the atmosphere was a little forced and awkward. I honestly didn't find something extra special in Nicole and Tank's relationship. It was all physical at first, and that was okay; it was great. Then it was your typical, wait, did I see something shift in his eyes? or, ah the feels are hitting me, am I falling for him? BUT I WANTED MOREEEE. And it wasn't satisfying enough. There was something missing, and I couldn't put my finger on it. He treated her well...Woah that's it. Like, seriously, I don't think there was anything beyond that. When Nicole's mother would ask her \"Does he treat you right?\" like it's the most important thing, like it's the only thing that matters. And I know why she'd think it's important, I do. But there are many other factors. I honestly didn't see, like, actual chemistry. Beyond the physical attraction and all that. I don't know. I really wanted this book to become my next favorite. I'm certainly not giving up on bad-boy-bikers books just yet, though."}, {"userName": "Christina", "userReviewDate": "Jun 26, 2017", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/20680926-christina", "userReview": "4 Stars - 3 Flames OMG you guys!!!

Yes, THE Jessica from the first installment. Jessica is getting married to Zeb and guess who's by her side helping her? Yep, Nicole. But there seems to be someone else too. A shadow. A bodyguard. A protector. And he's had his eye on Nicole for over a year now.Tank is the playa. Yep, that guy. The one that doesn't do relationships and is oh too happy to \"do 'em and leave 'em\". He absolutely has his past issues, but don't we all? It's not until Nicole boldly makes the first move that Tank can let his guard down. And what an amazing moment that becomes.Look.

When the attraction gets to be to much to ignore they agree to one and done but it's not enough so they agree to two and shoo and even that's not enough.

However, I found little plot points within the story that didn't quite add up, so I lost the motivation to finish about 60% of the way through. I managed to stay with it though, and finished it off.

Book 3 in the True Brothers MC.Nicole hasn't got thing one good to say about bikers despite the fact her best friends are either married to them or are going to be. Nicole is a piece of work, I liked her snark especially with the men. There's a reason for Nicole's often times brash behavior, which comes to light later in the book.Getting ready for Jessica's wedding, she and Nicole are being driven by the over the top Tank as he's known. He's been a Marine, has a sister who has a crap marriage and a divorce that put him through hell. We don't get the details here, but you can surmise. He sees his driver duty that day as punishment, having to put up with the two women, Nicole who isn't exactly pleasant to him and Jess has turned into Bridezilla. Nicole is no slouch, she's got a masters degree and works designing new computer gaming for the casinos. Her mother lives in town, they moved to Reno after her father went to jail. Nicole has some terrifying memories of her young life. She and Tank get friendly the night of the rehearsal dinner and Nicole insists it's a one and done deal.She just can't resist Tank. Tank is down for that, he's not interested in anything that resembles a relationship. So one and done become's two and shoo and on they go. Carefully but it's obvious they care about each other. Meanwhile someone has torched the MC's cycle shop the night of the wedding. This on the heels of several other incidents and they're leaning toward blaming a rival group of not so nice bikers. They even look at their new recruits. As things evolve on several fronts the story comes to a major pivot point that just made my jaw drop. It ties up most of the questions in this story. I loved Tank and Nicole together. Stella his dog was a keeper. I'll go back and read the first two books, I liked this well enough to do that. Great book.

Anyway, that is not the story, so Tank and Nicole are attracted to each, but Nicole, detests, biker gangs, since she has had bad experience with them, however she is attracted to Tank, so propositions him to a one and done. Tank agrees, since he is not the type for a relationship, been there and done that, and failed at it. Of course, they did not stay with the arrangement. Now I have to say, I was not crazy about her so called friends, not too friendly, I only liked Brittany.

Pretty sure someone getting choked would fall under physical abuse. As enjoyable as Nicole and Tank were though, they are not the reason I will remember this book.

Having read and liked the first two books in the series, I was looking forward to reading this one. I highly recommend the entire series but each book could be read as a standalone.Tank and Nicole initially met in the previous books. Tank thinks she's the good girl with a smart mouth but classy. He has noticed she looks down on bikers and even though he would love a one nighter with her, he doesn't think it will happen. Tank comes with his own baggage, an abused childhood and PTSD from the war he fought in Afghanistan as well as a bad previous marriage. He has vowed he'll never enter into a relationship and never have children. Nicole has hidden secrets that she takes forever to reveal. She's brash, smart mouthed but deep down she's drawn to Tank.What starts out as a \"one and done\", then a \"two and shoo\" , turns into a standing booty call between the two. But their feelings begin to get to deep and both end up breaking the vows they've made to themselves, never fall in love with a biker and never fall in love and commit to a woman. I truly enjoyed Tank and Nicole's journey even though at times I did get a little tired of her snarky attitude and wanted her to just go ahead and let her secret out. Overall, it was a very good read and again I recommend this one and the previous two in the series. I hope Brittany and Axle get a story in the near future. I could read between the lines that these two have a history that needs to be told. Yes, there's some heartbreak and some tears in the story. Nothing to do with the main characters but it's still a sad incident. Nicole and Tank's relationship developed at a good pace and Tank was one of the hottest heroes I've read about lately.

Nicole has made no secret of the fact that she doesn't like bikers, even though Jessica is the second of her friends to marry one of the True Brothers. Tank has kept his instant attraction to Nicole to himself--it started from the moment he first saw her. She's snarky (I love snarky women), smart, sassy, feisty and sexy, but what Nicole has kept to herself is her reason for disliking bikers--her abusive father, who has been incarcerated for manslaughter for the last 15 years, and who was also MC member. Although he never hit her, he certainly battered her her mother, and verbally abused and threatened Nicole. There'a another problem, Tank doesn't do relationships. He's already been married and divorced once. He's now a one-and-done kind of guy for another reason he's kept to himself--his four tours in Afghanistan which resulted a severe case of PTSD, and fearing that one of his violent nightmares might result in his actually and inadvertently injuring a bed partner, he doesn't spend the night either. But all of that changes when he and Nicole agree to act on their mutual attraction and have a one-nighter that begins to change everything for both of them, and it quickly becomes a two-nighter, and then...well, I guess you'll have to read this novel to find out.Of course, there's more to this novel than just the romance, there are rival MCs, vandalism, arson, verbal abuse, and physical violence ending in murder, as well as some seriously hot sex, so if any of the aforementioned are triggers for you, this might not be the novel for you. What this novel doesn't have, thankfully, are descriptions of the skanky women who'll hang around the clubhouse and do anything any of the club members want at any time and in public. What sets Ms. Archer's series apart from many of the less well-written MC romances out there is that she gives her characters believable backstories letting us see what motivates their behavior, and she doesn't dwell on the wild parties, heavy drinking and drug use many less talented novelists include as part of their stories. What also sets this series apart is that the True Brothers really are a brotherhood--the members aren't just angry, disgruntled misfits, they actually care abut one another. The True Brothers MC has a number of businesses, but they aren't whoremongers, pimps, gun runners or drug dealers. Each member of the MC I've encountered in these three novels can certainly curse up a storm, as can their women, but they also have such qualities as kindness, fairness, and an admirable love of family, both their own and also of the other club members. These novels are filled with secondary characters you want to know more about, they are fast-paced and emotional reads, and these are some of the reasons why I eagerly anticipate each and every the upcoming novel in this series.I voluntarily read an advance reader copy of this novel.

We don\u2019t discover until much later in the book why she feels this way. She is the Queen of one and done. I didn\u2019t like Nicole at the beginning, but as her character grows, we learn so much more about her and see her make positive changes. Tank is a member of True Brothers MC. He is an ex-marine, protective, tall, muscled, alpha, with mild PTSD and a big heart. His ex-wife was a total nut job and he\u2019s become the King of one and done. Nicole\u2019s two best friends are happily coupled with bikers. She doesn\u2019t hesitate to let them know she thinks they\u2019ve made poor choices or to show her disdain to any of the MC members. When she discovers how drawn she is to Tank, she decides one night shouldn\u2019t be a problem. She\u2019ll get it out of her system, right?

Can\u2019t wait for the next installment!I voluntarily reviewed an ARC provided by the publisher and NetGalley."}, {"userName": "P.e. lolo", "userReviewDate": "Sep 11, 2017", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/7345595-p-e-lolo", "userReview": "This is the third book in the series and it is dealing with Nicole. While they are getting ready for the wedding from the characters in the first book. Nichole is dealing with issues that she has with the biker club, because her dad was or still is a 1% and is doing time for manslaughter. Because of that the family had to move.

After his fourth tour he came back broken and is still having problems. Along with his mother, and his sister and her no good husband he does not see any good. After spending a day with Nicole with errands for the wedding he sees her much differently. After a night of partying they decide to do a one night stand. Of course after that first time there is a second time and then they begin to get to know each other and he wants to get to know her but does not know why she is holding back. When business associated with the club start being attacked the club starts to search for a reason and then Nicole\u2019s mother has her come over and in walks the one person she never thought she would see again her father. This does not go well. Now Tank can\u2019t get a hold of her and with the problems with the club she starts to think that the club thinks that they are blaming her. Read this book to see what happens. The bedroom scenes between these two are intense. Each also have their own PTSD issues as well. The characters are good as well as the story. I got this book from Netgalley.com I gave it 5 stars.

Good solid start but followed by a muddled middle, interrupted with a crazysauce twist, then fizzled to a weak ending. I'm new to the series, and was intrigued by Tank and Nicole's sexually charged connection from the start. Both Tank and Nicole claimed they were just going to be \"one and done\" with each other because they weren't relationship type people, and, well, we just know how that ends in Romancelandia. Tank is the kind of biker whose story I enjoy the most; the kind that falls hard. Almost against his will, Tank goes straight from wedding hookup to claiming Nicole with a caveman \"Mine!\". The problem was that Nicole was so wrapped up in her own issues that she didn't really connect well with Tank or anyone else in the True Brothers-verse. Once Nicole's mysterious history catches up to the brotherhood, I expected her to reveal some inner strength to Tank, her friends, and the brotherhood. Instead, Nicole dissolved into some kind of self-absorbed, juvenile catatonic funk that required just about every character in the book bending over backwards to convince Nicole that it wasn't her fault. It was exasperating. From this book, the True Brothers and their women seem to be a strongly connected group, a la Kristen Ashley's alphas. Too bad that Nicole just didn't seem to deserve to be part of it. I strongly suspected that the other brothers' stories were a far better way to dive into this world.Note: I received an ARC in exchange for a honest review."}, {"userName": "Danielle Gypsy Soul", "userReviewDate": "Jul 17, 2017", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/35114142-danielle-gypsy-soul", "userReview": "True Brothers is a MC series that I have been enjoying and I enjoyed this one probably even a bit more than the last one. I loved Tank and in fact he is one of my all time favorite MC characters. My problem was that I thought Nicole was just a bit too judgmental and it lasted far too long. I get that she had a background that didn't show bikers in the best of light but her two best friends are in love with bikers and she has been around them enough to know you can't judge everyone based off of one person you had a bad experience with. I also hated the way Jessica acted in this book. It was way OTT (I've never actually seen a bride act that mean and irritable) and so I didn't enjoy the Bridezilla aspect of a character I had previously liked. However, I did enjoy a lot of other parts of the book and I liked Tank and Nicole together. I loved the way he handled her - he accepted her but didn't put up with her crap. This book had a few unexpected moments that made me tear up that I didn't see coming. Overall, another really good addition to this series - I'm looking forward to more from this author. A copy of this book was provided to me by NetGalley and the publisher with no requirements for a review.

I really struggled with rating it. I knew from almost the beginning, I just KNEW, what the author was setting up. But I didn't want to believe it. The last 10% of the book just went to shit for me. I don't think it was necessary, I hated it, and I didn't want to read it. It utterly pissed me off. It left me so soured on the book and the series that I want to call it quits. I am struggling not to give this a one star rating.So here's the reason for the two and a half stars I decided on. I really enjoyed the first 90% of the book and, before the end, had thought it was my favorite of the series. I LOVED Tank. I loved that the author seemed to move away from thinking the H's had to be assholes because they were in an MC. Zag (1st book) was a total asshole, Reb (2nd book) not quite as bad, and here in the third book we have Tank. Who was ALL man. But a man with HEART. He didn't take crap but oh he was so sweet!! That's what I want in an H. I even liked Nicole who had been, in the previous books, prickly and bitchy. The author did a great job of really making me see where she was coming from. Looking back I can see now where her issues took over her thinking when it came to bikers and why she acted the way she did. She and Tank were great for each other and I loved that they each seemed to \"get\" each other. And of course I loved the heat.SO... I'm just sad. What was cracking up to be my favorite book of the series just took a down turn that, in my eyes, it couldn't recover from. I couldn't recover from.I received this book from Netgalley in exchange for an honest review"}, {"userName": "LeeAnne", "userReviewDate": "Jul 10, 2017", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/23233270-leeanne", "userReview": "I really enjoyed this MC romance - I'd definitely consider it in the more \"tame\" side as far as MC books go so if you're looking for a lighter Motorcycle read this one is for you!Nicole comes from a past that she's tired to keep hidden from everyone. She's very judgemental when it comes to her friends relationships with their \"MC men\" as she absolutely hates motorcycle clubs and wants nothing to do with them. One of her friends is marrying a biker though and Nicole is having trouble sticking to her disdain when the gorgeous Tank is assigned to be the girls \"detail.\" Neither Tank nor Nicole is interested in anything long term and decide a one night stand would be perfect... except it's not enough. My absolute least favorite part of this book were Nicole's \"friends.\" They were absolute A holes and I am still upset with how mean/nasty they are to Nicole throughout this book, like I really was waiting for Nicole to fire back and kick them to the curb but it doesn't happen. It's the sole reason I'm giving a 4 instead of 5 star rating.

While she hasn't told anyone about growing up with a father that was a biker who was sent to prison for murder, Nicole doesn't want to end up like her mother did by giving in to a biker for even one night.Tank is the one biker not looking for more than one night. After his tours in the Marines, his own marriage that didn't last and watching his sister put up with a deadbeat husband, Tank knows that he is not relationship material.So Tank and Nicole give in to one night because the chemistry between them is just too strong to ignore. And since Tank is easy on the eyes, one night turns into two and they can't seem to stay away from each other. What happens when the club has trouble and they think it might be a rival club or mafia? Will Tank and Nicole keep things going and make a relationship work? What happens when Nicole's father shows back up? I love this series and I hope there will be more. It is filled with love, laughter, heartache, heartbreak and suspense. If you are looking for a great MC series that will have you wanting more, then give this one a read, you will love it too."}, {"userName": "Julie", "userReviewDate": "Apr 24, 2017", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/21679238-julie", "userReview": "I'm loving this series and it's characters. Tank has especially been a favourite and I've been looking forward to his story. He's not ready to settle down and he wants to stay clear of Nicole, she seems like a girl you go steady with and she doesn't seem too happy with his brothers and how they live their lives. But that doesn't seem to stop him from thinking about her, and the more he see's her the better she is looking. Nicole finally comes on to him and suggest they hook up, Tank agrees whole heartedly. Which is the start of them regularly getting together until they are meeting so often that they finally have to realize they are in a relationship. I liked the way the characters change and grew in the beginning and developed for their relationship. There's thrills, suspense and steamy loving in this enjoyable story.
