More than a manual, Verbalize is a brilliant, fun, funny treatise on genre fiction and how to write it and think about it, using scores of great examples. I read the book in one sitting but then went back in subsequent days and did the exercises. I will never think of verbs in the same way again! Additionally, Suede will help you clarify character and action and will make your work cook. A great addition for any reference library."}, {"userName": "RaeLatte", "userReviewDate": "Mar 10, 2018", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/4866517-raelatte", "userReview": "If you are a writer than you need to read Verbalize by Damon Suede.
