The author grew up in Fort Worth, as did I, and knew this stretch of the Brazos, as did I, though his knowledge is much more intimate; I never, in my memory, set foot in the river. My paternal grandparents and a couple of my father's siblings lived in Granbury, as do some of my cousins still. My maternal grandmother was born in Dennis, a bit upstream from Granbury. I've lived at both ends of the Brazos, and for a quarter of a century on a tributary to the Brazos, not far from Granbury. Mr. Graves's narrative of his three-week canoe trip down the river from Possum Kingdom dam to Barnard's Trading Post, with his 6-month-old dachshund as company, is filled with river lore and frontier stories, as well as with the people who lived there when he made his trip, before the De Cordova Bend Dam was built to impound Lake Granbury. (The plans to build dams on the river was his rationale for the trip, his means of saying goodbye to the river he knew as a boy.) The book speaks to me, deep in my core, and I thoroughly enjoyed reading it. I just don't know why it took me so long to pick it up."}, {"userName": "Jamie", "userReviewDate": "Jun 19, 2015", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/7394473-jamie", "userReview": "This book has been sitting on my shelf for 15 years, unread. For reasons that escape me, I thought it would be boring and poorly written. And perhaps, at the time I bought it, that would have been true. I attended and worked at the Worth Ranch Boy Scout camp (mentioned in one 2 sentence segment in the book), which is what piqued interest in the book. The curious terrain and copious amount of legend and mythology that area are enough to make anyone become obsessed.It was thoughtfully written, enjoyable, and informative. It reminds me of Steinbeck's \"Travels with Charlie\". Not surprising, I guess: man travels remote, infrequently travled path with dog, recounting his interactions with locals, throwing in some history and lore, and reflecting on the larger flaws of society. It was written during the same period, too, so the language and tone is surprisingly similar.If the reader did not have experience with Texas, I don't think they would enjoy it quite as much as I did. It should still be on the list of those who like travel books with a relaxed, country feel, before the days that travelogues morphed into whole new beast. A lot of travelogues now have reality show syndrome, trying to one up each other on extremes. This one feels genuine and relaxed. The author seems to be someone who sits in both worlds, with sentimentalities for the old ways of using the land as a resource to be exploited and a conservationist. He expresses his naturist ideals in a way that would appeal to the traditionalist, not in a forceful fashion.A quote on the cover compares the author to Thoreau, and I think it has some merit. Of course, it's been a long time since I read Thoreau. \"Walden\" is probably one of those books I need to re-read. Overall, it's an enjoyable book, much more so for someone who knows the area he travels through. But it's a great book overall for those who like travelogues and think about the world around them."}, {"userName": "Matthew", "userReviewDate": "Oct 23, 2008", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/1648411-matthew", "userReview": "To this day, the Brazos is unpredictable, mesmerizing, frustrating and beautiful. It is this work by John Graves that once saved the Brazos from being dammed into nonexistence.In Waco, one sees the hoboes that still fish down by the riverwalk, and the fireworks on the 4th of July reflecting in its waters. I remember swinging into the brown water from a rope with my friends in my teenage summers, I even got my first kiss along the bank of the Brazos. Floating down the river in a canoe, one has to wonder about all the history. One can still feel the centuries of human experience, even if you're just staring at an old rusty car sitting on the riverbed when the Brazos has slowed down to a trickle. If you feel this history, and you want to know more about it and the characters made by the river, this book is the place to start.Graves knew the Brazos, and he knew its personal secrets like an old friend. A lot of what he knew he went looking for, walking up to homes and talking and staying with old timers, eating breakfast with them and sleeping in their beds. He even knew the names of most of the bends in the river - in this instance from about Possum Kingdom to Mineral Wells. This is where Graves grew up, and his recollections of the 'cedar people' and his boyhood friends are just wonderful! Some of those 'make you laugh and cry' type deals.Layered into this memoir are tales of astonishing family feuds, the adventures of Comanches, the life of Charles Goodnight, and even a little bassett hound, and more!If you've ever so much as glanced at the Brazos, I beg of you to read this book some day. It is a book that has and will continue to change the world."}, {"userName": "Drew", "userReviewDate": "Nov 05, 2017", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/2074452-drew", "userReview": "I would give it 4.5 stars if permitted.

It is about a trip down the Brazos river, yes, but it treats the folks that have dotted the plains and hills of Central Texas much as it treats the river itself.John Graves writes beautifully, in a prose influenced but never overwhelmed by Ernest Hemingway. He also hankers to tell stories about the extinct Comanche tribe - \"The People\" - that raided much of the land round the Brazos, for a century.Though at times the story is tedious, in the end you wouldn't want the book any shorter than it is.Highly recommended reading for any Texan or anyone wishing to visit Lone Star State or someday become a Texan himself."}, {"userName": "DavidB", "userReviewDate": "Jan 25, 2009", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/793027-davidb", "userReview": "John Graves journalistic piece is now regarded as a seminal work of American Conservationism.

I'm new to Graves' work but I can see why he has had a following, and as a new migrant to the Fort Worth area, I'm glad to have the opportunity to experience some of the wild terrain that still exists along some sections of the Brazos. He writes with real humanity about hunting and wilderness, and the utility of those activities in a society that has become so commodified as to render them useless pastimes. He writes with a passionate curiosity about old legends of historical note, battles between natives and ranchers, or drunken family disputes. But above all he writes in appreciation of each yard of the river that he rambles down in his canoe.

Mr. Grave's lyric genius carries the reader like a rolling river. I found myself googling the names he mentions in relaying his tales, learning as I traveled through history with him.

The tone is beautifully rich, and the descriptions almost timeless. Here is a man who, like Cornelius Suttree, has overriding wish: freedom, to do what he wants, and explore the world on his terms.

Most of us in one way or another count on them as strongly as other ages counted on the green shoots rising in the spring.\u201d\"We shall shortly be privileged to carry our inadequacies with us to the stars\"\"I ate about dusk and sat staring at a little stick fire that needed constant refueling. The pup had dry dogfood with squirrel gravy, and sought the tent. Aloneness is most striking at evening, however it may happen to be striking you at the moment. Day\u2019s absorbent busy-ness is past, and the dishes are stacked dirty, and you are confronted with yourself and confronted too with whether or not you like being where you are, by yourself.\"\"Some days load themselves with questions whose answers have died, and maybe never mattered hugely\"\"Nothing that happened in [Texas history], then or later, made any notable dent in human history. From one very possible point of view, the stories tell of a partly unnecessary, drawn-out squabble between savages and half-illiterate louts constituting the fringes of a culture ... They tell too--the stories--of the subsequent squabbles among the louts themselves: of cattle thievery, corn whisky, Reconstruction, blood feuds, lynchings, splinter sectarianism, and further illiteracy.Can they then have any bearing on mankind's adventure?Maybe, a little. They don't all tell of louts. There was something of a showing-through; meanings floated near the surface which have relevance to the murkier thing Americans have become. It didn't happen just on the Brazos, certainly, but all along the line of that moving brush fire. There's nothing new in the idea that the frontier had continuing impact on our character or that one slice of that frontier, examined, may to some degree explain the whole.But in truth such gravities were not what salted the tales I could read, looking off over the low country from the point atop the bluffs. Mankind is one thing; a man's self is another. What that self is tangles itself knottily with what his people were, and what they came out of. Mine came out of Texas, as did I. If those were louts, they were my own louts.\"\"If a man couldn\u2019t escape what he came from, we would most of us still be peasants in Old World hovels. But if, having escaped or not, he wants in some way to know himself, define himself, and tries to do it without taking into account the thing he came from, he is writing without any ink in his pen. The provincial who cultivates only his roots is in peril, potato-like, of becoming more root than plant. The man who cuts his roots away and denies that they were ever connected with him withers into half a man.. it\u2019s not necessary to like being a Texan, or a Midwesterner, or a Jew, or an Andalusian, or a Negro, or a hybrid child of the international rich. It is, I think, necessary to know in that crystal chamber of the mind where one speaks straight to oneself that one is or was that thing, and for any understanding of the human condition its probably necessary to know a little about what the thing consists of.And Mrs Sherman and Bigfoot Wallace and Charlie Goodnight and Old Lady Rippy and the rest of them, haunting the country they\u2019d known below the Point, were a part of my thing. They weren\u2019t all of it, but they were a part. In mere fact, they were. Much of the good and bad and beside-the-point of what they\u2019d been was stuck in me as certainly as the canyon wren;s song, as surely as were the memories, looking down toward Brazos town, of the times we\u2019d misread the wild zigzagging channel in those sandy stretches and had ended on bars and had had to get out to tug the loaded boat over, up to knees in shaking, sucking quicksand. That is all meant much was doubtful, and that I\u2019d ever understand a half of what it did mean was more doubtful still, but the effort seemed worthwhile.\"\"The rosy preindustrial time is past when the humanism of a man like Thoreau (was it humanism?) could still theorize in terms of natural harmony. Humanism has to speak in teh term of extant human beings. The terms of today\u2019s human beings are air conditioners and suburbs and water impoundments overlaying whole countrysides and the hell with nature except maybe in a cross-sectional park here and there. In our time quietness and sun and leaves and bird song and all the multitudinous lore of the natural world have to come second or third, because whether we wanted to be born there or not, we were all born into the prickly machine humming place that man has hung for himself above that natural world.\""}, {"userName": "Sharmyn (Lumsden) Lilly", "userReviewDate": "Oct 14, 2016", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/28599044-sharmyn-lumsden-lilly", "userReview": "A gorgeous book and a must for all who love the Earth and language; especially for those who love Texas"}, {"userName": "Jeff", "userReviewDate": "Feb 16, 2016", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/51895153-jeff", "userReview": "Traveling alone by canoe, one has an opportunity to do a lot of thinking. And that\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s what John Graves did in the mid-1950s. A series of dams were being proposed along his beloved Brazos River in the hill country of Texas. As a final goodbye to the free flowing river, Graves and a puppy spent most of a November floating the river. Passing familiar bends, he stops to recalls the history of the area. Other times, he reminisces about a favorite fishing hole or the site of a hunt he\u00e2\u20ac\u2122d enjoyed. He tells the stories of old settlers and in some places encounters folks whose roots to the river go back into the nineteenth century, at a time when the river was really wild.The book flows as slow as deep water, allowing the reader to savor the stories. Graves recalls \u00e2\u20ac\u0153the People,\u00e2\u20ac\u009d or the Comanche, who\u00e2\u20ac\u2122d controlled the area before Anglo-migration in the 19th Century. He tells the stories of settlers who died at the hands of \u00e2\u20ac\u0153The People,\u00e2\u20ac\u009d as well as those who helped \u00e2\u20ac\u0153stabilize\u00e2\u20ac\u009d the area. But it wasn\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t really settled. Rough times preceded and followed the Civil War. Lynchings were common, feuds fierce and revenge a way of life. Lynching wasn\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t just reserved for African-Americans. Caucasians, Mexicans and even in one case, a mother and several of her daughters found themselves with a rope around their neck and dangling as a \u00e2\u20ac\u0153pendant from a limb.\u00e2\u20ac\u009d \u00e2\u20ac\u0153Vengeance is mine, says the Lord,\u00e2\u20ac\u2122 but the good citizens of Springtown, Parker County, Texas, appear to have honed themselves on His cutting tools.\u00e2\u20ac\u009d Because of the feuds and desire for revenge, he admits that many stories were lost for they were not told because \u00e2\u20ac\u0153like a broken-back rattler, [they] still had a bite left in them.\u00e2\u20ac\u009d Graves also spends time pondering how stories have changed over time.Life was as harsh in this country in the 19th Century, not just with the lack of law and order, but also with the limits of the soil as farmers and cattlemen strove to eke out a living. Graves tells about the various settlers and styles of cabins they\u00e2\u20ac\u2122d built and about how, in time, pecans had became big business. But it\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s an investment for the planter\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s children, as the trees slowly reach maturity. Graves also ponders the blending of faith along the river. \u00e2\u20ac\u0153Calvinistic fundamentalism and its joined opposite, violent wallowing in sin settled that part of the world and have flourished there since like bacteria in the yolk of an egg.\u00e2\u20ac\u009d A little later he notes that it\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s a good thing there are a \u00e2\u20ac\u0153few Mexican Catholics around\u00e2\u20ac\u009d for they \u00e2\u20ac\u0153dull the spines of the Baptist prickly pear.\u00e2\u20ac\u009d Even the pious were not above the feuds as he tells the story of a Methodist Episcopal Church-South preacher named Jim Truitt, whose testimony helping convict a man. In the end, the man\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s son took care of the preacher.Throughout his journey, Graves notes the calls and the habits of certain birds. He also is reminded of his time during the war, on islands in the South Pacific, a theme that seems to haunt him. Although he hunts and even shot a duck on the water for his Thanksgiving diner, he reflects on how he changed from his childhood. As a kid, he\u00e2\u20ac\u2122d shoot any animal that moved, but now only shoots for meat. He also fishes, using a trotline when he needs meat. But he confesses his love for the fly rod, although he wouldn\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t argue it with \u00e2\u20ac\u0153a man who finds his joy in hurling treble-hooked bullets through the air, and winching his fish to boat or shore with an apparatus that practically thinks for him.\u00e2\u20ac\u009dAs the end of the trip approaches, he finds himself pondering life off the river, noting, \u00e2\u20ac\u0153It didn\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t go on forever, the river.\u00e2\u20ac\u009d In a like manner, I remember the last week of my trip on the Appalachian Trail, when I wished the trail didn\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t end on that mountain ahead. But his trip came to an end and returned home to write this book.This isn\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t a fast book. It\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s slow, but the stories are rich and the pace forces us to slow down.

Then a young man still aiming to slake his literary ambition, Graves had returned from abroad to take care of his ailing father in Texas, and then, some months later, packed a canoe with comestibles and a 6-month-old dachsund to paddle the Brazos River, recollecting, among many other experiences, the lost campfires of his youth spent with a childhood chum and a Robesonian family manservant who'd mastered the art of the outdoor cookout. It was Graves' goal to experience the river once more before a series of five planned water-control projects would dam up the memories forever (owing to Graves' eloquence and the efforts of other Brazos defenders, there would ultimately be just one dam built on this nearly 200-mile stretch of Texas's longest interior river).A deeply intimate portrayal of one man's bond with a riparian habitat and its human history, Graves delves into years of his own reading on Brazos occupation by Native Americans, encroachment from immigrants to the East, and the often-chilling clashes that ensued. He's neither apologetic nor boastful about his colorful ribbon of land. But he's boundlessly curious, weaving his own philosophical musings as a man of letters and medals (degrees from Rice and Columbia, decorations as a wounded World War II veteran in the Pacific, and expatriate ramblings for several years in Europe).What emerges is an uncanny, uncommon voice, with an equally accurate ear for the voice of the contemporary central Texas characters he meets along the Brazos. Recently retired Texas columnist Leon Hale (who himself was unsurpassed as a newspaper columnist in the past 65 years) played a small role in \"Goodbye to a River\" and was a close friend of Graves. Hale turned his blog over to his wife Babette for a formal eulogy the day after Graves' death, and it was Babette's piece that pulled me into tracking down \"Goodbye to a River\" from a Texas friend at work, who loaned me his signed copy:http://blog.chron.com/leonhale/2013/08/goodbye-to-a-voice/Here's an excellent obit story on Graves from the Fort-Worth Star-Telegram. \"Goodbye to a River\" remains in print and is worth tracking down by any means necessary.http://www.star-telegram.com/2013/07/31/5044584/john-graves-author-of-goodbye.html?rh=1A sample of \"Goodbye to a River,\" wherein Graves pulls ashore to meet McKee, an old farmer acquaintance, only to find him missing and to greet the man's wife:\"... I hadn't met her before. Standing at the top of the back steps, she said she remembered his speaking of me. She was around fifty, in gingham, with her black hair pulled back on the sides of her head and sun-narrowed eyes \u2014 the big-framed, gaunt breed of woman that farmers and ranchers so often pick to mother their sons after they've finished with the pinch-faced pretties of the honkytonks. Sometimes at town gatherings of people I have looked around and wondered what happened to that physical type in the process of urbanization, and then have seen them maybe along the wall, standing round-backed, dressed to deprecate their bulk among the slim-waisted twinkling blondes with Empire hairdos. In the country, they still stand straight, and are prized.\""}, {"userName": "Charlotte", "userReviewDate": "Feb 16, 2015", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/2333403-charlotte", "userReview": "I'm glad this book was written. Graves grew up paddling/hunting/camping along the Brazos River in Texas. He then went on to travel the world, receive a formal education, and fight in a war before returning home. He was an adult by the 1950s when there were plans in place to dam the river he loved as a child. He decided to take a canoe trip along the river to say goodbye to the places he knew. He was alone except for a dog he simply referred to as \"the passenger\". The writing style matches the journey. It flows along evenly, then meanders off onto a tributary, stalls out at places. By the end, admittedly, you are feeling a bit tired and gritty and ready to return to city life. His musings are a combination of direct naturalist observations with some insights about environmentalism way ahead of his time, remembrances from his childhood exploring the river, and historical accounts of people who had lived in these places before him. I found it amusing that whenever he told stories of the '60s, for instance, he meant the 1860s. There were stories passed down to him and presumably researched about the Comanches, the original Anglo settlers, etc. What I appreciated was that he shared some personal opinions without being judgmental and without ever being nostalgic to the point of sappiness. Obviously the river is important to him, but he held a realistic acceptance about change and about human nature. There was not necessarily a sentimentality about the \"good old days\" which in most cases were about violence and deprivation. I appreciated that when he spoke about hunting, especially for sport, he could question the ethics of it and amend his actions but also forgive himself and others. I imagine he was in a rare position to have such intimate, first-hand knowledge of this particular place in time but also the intelligence and expanded world view to put it in context. His voice reminded me of my Great Uncle Beloit who lived on Lake Barkley in Kentucky and was always self-reliant, resourceful, and insightful despite some emotional distance.

Never-the-less, this is a book I loved and will reread at some point. Written by one of Texas's great authors, this book is the tale of John Graves writing about a three week canoe trip down the Brazos River before its possibly imminent demise from damns proposed in the 1950's. It's set in the area of his childhood home before it's about to be flooded, when most of the surrounding riverbanks will be submerged forever. As he floats along, alone except for his passenger- a young dachshund, he tells of memories of his youth and recollections of others that were passed along to him about the country through which he travels. The stories cover early pioneer days where Anglo-Ams lived with fierce Comanches, to the later period of poor farmers working over over-worked land, and the Ser Sta Gro's where he stops to shop a time or two. There are inspiring passages describing the beauty of the nature around him, and vignettes of meeting those along the river, some of whom admire and some of whom scorn his voyage on a soon-to-be lost river.

Within a few pages, I already understood what all the fuss is about. It's so beautifully written. To quote my dad (who I loaned the book to immediately upon finishing it), \"There are passages which stretch the limits of art.\"I started this book at the beginning of an extremely stressful 5-month period (not by coincidence, the same length of a school semester). The time I carved out to read was usually about 10-15 minutes before I passed out in bed each night. It was a great book to pick up and put down and read in small snippets like that, but I also regret that I was not always as mentally acute as I would have liked when I was reading it. Those passages my dad references above sometimes circle back around on top of themselves, or meander from a point, or use terminology I'd like to research, and so I'm certain I've missed things. Hell, I'd like to take a whole college course on this book (and I don't doubt that exists somewhere).I'm already looking forward to re-reading it and attempting to savor it again properly (this time during an extended stretch of days in a hammock, or in a chair before a fireplace). But even with my rather poor reading of it, this book was immediately placed into my top echelon of favorite books I've read. The hype and praise is well-deserved. Hats off to you, Mr. Graves."}, {"userName": "Dave Gaston", "userReviewDate": "Apr 19, 2010", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/1269880-dave-gaston", "userReview": "I stumbled into Grave\u2019s writing by first reading \u201cMyself and Strangers,\u201d which is the last book he published. It was a youthful memoir reflecting on his old diary notes from his youthful day\u2019s abroad. Captured within those pages was his depiction of a young Graves; a struggling artist, naturalist and spirited intellectual. Within the timeline of his old diary, he had yet write his first novel. That first breakthrough novel, turned out to be, \u201cThe River.\u201d So, in a strange, not-so-linear life line, reading \u201cThe River\u201d second makes sense. And I liked it very much. His writing was as clear and crisp at the beginning of his career as well as the end. A little long in the tooth maybe, perhaps young Graves had much to prove with his first book. Still, the man captures the essence of the Brazo\u2019s River in Texas; the people and place, nature and life, history and tall-tale, all in beautiful micro-dots. Cameo after cameo of colorful stories and observations from his endless ruminative mind. The book dawdles and surges, just like the river. I can\u2019t help but think that Graves would grin at the thought of a Chicagoan listening to his river book (full of Indians and hard scrabble) on an slick gizmo like an ipod while walking an urban grid. But of course, that is why he took the trip and wrote the book.

Leave politics, the economy, the weather, your aching back behind and be at peace with yourself and the author as he moseys down the Brazos River in Texas in the fall of the year, by himself, looking to say goodbye to a river he has known since his youth. The river is about to be dammed and WWII vet John Graves wants to be on it one last time before it becomes a series of lakes. He invites the reader to understand the history of the river and the people who lived on and around it, as he recounts battles, atrocities by both Indians and whites, Mexicans and Americans. He also introduces the reader to people living on it then (1960's)and discloses a lot about his inner self and the dog he calls \"the passenger\". I've read it three times, and like the Bible which I've read 15 times, I get a little more from it each time I read it. The pages are stippled with yellow sticky sheets so I can quickly refer to John's lyric voice which reminds me how a truly great author puts words together that move the reader. John is almost 93 now and living in Texas with his wife Jane on the limestone ledge he calls home."}, {"userName": "Kathy Kattenburg", "userReviewDate": "Jun 18, 2012", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/10268238-kathy-kattenburg", "userReview": "Thoreau with a Texas twang. In the mid-1950s, the author, John Graves, set out on a canoe trip on the Brazos River near where he was born and raised. He set out to see the river and the surrounding countryside and the people who lived there before a series of proposed dams changed the landscape forever. Other than the people he encountered on his shore stops, Graves's only companion was his six-month-old dachshund puppy, whom he refers to as \"the passenger,\" and sometimes as \"the pup.\"Graves's writing is at once lyrical and down to earth, and filled with a dry humor about the unique and unforgettable characters, both present-day (his present-day) and historical, who shaped the land and were shaped by it. It's a delightful narrative, both travelogue and hymn to the natural world. It's also poignant when you remember that the river Graves knew no longer exists. Don Henley of Eagles fame, who is also from Texas and lives there with his wife and kids, was inspired to write his bittersweet and quite beautiful song \"Goodbye To a River\" after reading Graves's book."}, {"userName": "Lawrence", "userReviewDate": "Aug 05, 2012", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/11593786-lawrence", "userReview": "I grew up in Ft. Worth, and I read this book for an English course when I was a student at Texas Christian University. My grandparents had a peach farm a few miles west of Weatherford, and in the summers I spent lots of time helping my grandfather pick fruit. He also was a welder, and he did occasional welding jobs for the sand and gravel works on the Brazos River by the highway bridge just outside of Mineral Wells. He would take me along, and while he was working I would wander along the Brazos River and do some target practicing with my 0.22 rifle. Once I stepped into some quicksand, but I managed to pull myself out. With this background I read \"Goodbye To A River\" with keen interest, savoring every page. I am a folk singer and singer-songwriter, and every time I sing \"The Rivers of Texas\" I think of Graves' book. It is one of my all time favorites, and a must for any son or daughter of Texas."}, {"userName": "John Geary", "userReviewDate": "Feb 05, 2015", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/2325371-john-geary", "userReview": "Excellent book. Like all good journeys, it had spots where you wanted to get past quickly; other spots where you wanted to linger - and in this case, could do so by re-reading the passage. It's a very poetic piece of writing, this tale of a trip down the Brazos River in Texas, with much of the poetry spent on descriptions of nature and natural processes. If you've ever paddled on a canoe trip for more than a few days, you'll really be able to relate to this story. If you haven't, there are many passages that relate the history of the area, mixed with tales of the author's personal history.It also could be considered an environmental essay, as the author laments the passing of the old ways and with that passing, the gradual but inexorable degradation of the natural world, a fact that prompted his need to take this trip down a river scheduled to be dammed. Surprising thoughts for the time, as he took this trip in 1959. It's a book I will most likely read again, some day."}, {"userName": "Matthew Fuller", "userReviewDate": "May 19, 2011", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/5035036-matthew-fuller", "userReview": "My father used to take me canoeing on the Brazos and Colorado Rivers and when I read this book it took me back to those great trips and fun times. It really is a culture...river life...and Graves takes you there and shows you some vivid images of how the river and its people are. I suspect if you're not an avid outdoorsman or if you have not spent time in a canoe, this book will be long, slow rolling, and tedious...just like the river itself. That impatience in the world is something graves writes about and he gives us some good life lessons on combating this impatience. Though I think it will be most meaningful to those that grew up enjoying the river, I think it will have a message for many. My only other complaint is that sometimes his colloquialism and sayings are a little unclear and perhaps even misused in comparison to the way I grew up knowing them...but then again his use of metaphor really makes up for that."}, {"userName": "Mathew Carruthers", "userReviewDate": "May 11, 2012", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/5928892-mathew-carruthers", "userReview": "I read this book as a young student at University of Dallas - part of the curriculum in one of the history classes taught by Dr. June Welch. Prof. Welch had met the author on several occasions and told my class a story of one early meeting during one of his lectures. Apparently, the two of them bumped into one another at some charity function or other. Dr. Welch, an attorney and judge prior to becoming a professor of history, loved this book. While Graves told Welch that he wished he could be a fancy attorney and a judge, Welch told him, \"I wish I could write Goodbye to a River, John.\" I really don't think there's a much higher compliment one can pay an author, especially when the one paying the compliment is an esteemed historian/writer/professor in his own right.It was this book that sparked my interest in travel narratives and journals, as well as books that present local history in an accessible style (so I don't feel like I'm reading a history book)."}], "description": "In the 1950s, a series of dams was proposed along the Brazos River in north-central Texas. For John Graves, this project meant that if the stream\u2019s regimen was thus changed, the beautiful and sometimes brutal surrounding countryside would also change, as would the lives of the people whose rugged ancestors had eked out an existence there. Graves therefore decided to visit that stretch of the river, which he had known intimately as a youth.Goodbye to a River is his account of that farewell canoe voyage. As he braves rapids and fatigue and the fickle autumn weather, he muses upon old blood feuds of the region and violent skirmishes with native tribes, and retells wild stories of courage and cowardice and deceit that shaped both the river\u2019s people and the land during frontier times and later. Nearly half a century after its initial publication, Goodbye to a River is a true American classic, a vivid narrative about an exciting journey and a powerful tribute to a vanishing way of life and its ever-changing natural environment.", "title": "Goodbye to a River: A Narrative", "url": "http://www.goodreads.com/book/show/107202.Goodbye_to_a_River", "average": 4.23, "cover": "https://images.gr-assets.com/books/1320395594l/107202.jpg", "reviews": 124, "authors": [{"url": "https://www.goodreads.com/author/show/23205.John_Graves", "name": "John Graves"}, {"url": "https://www.goodreads.com/author/show/3893539.Russell_Waterhouse", "name": "Russell Waterhouse"}], "type": ["Nonfiction", "History", "Travel", "Environment", "Autobiography"], "outlinks": ["http://www.goodreads.com/book/show/107202.Goodbye_to_a_River", "http://www.goodreads.com/book/show/1255280.Goodbye_to_a_River", "http://www.goodreads.com/book/show/18077730-goodbye-to-a-river", "http://www.goodreads.com/book/show/18633873-goodbye-to-a-river", "http://www.goodreads.com/book/show/1255279.Goodbye_to_a_River", "http://www.goodreads.com/book/show/708324.Hard_Scrabble", "http://www.goodreads.com/book/show/41217.From_a_Limestone_Ledge", "http://www.goodreads.com/book/show/899442.Texas_Rivers", "http://www.goodreads.com/book/show/1231852.Myself_and_Strangers", "http://www.goodreads.com/book/show/1381728.My_Dogs_and_Guns"]}
