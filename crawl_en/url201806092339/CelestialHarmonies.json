Absolutely", "userReviewDate": "Apr 22, 2010", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/2156200-k-d-absolutely", "userReview": "Celestial Harmonies: (1990) All the world\u2019s a stage art and pageantry in the Renaissance and baroque.Especially in its first part, reading Celestial Harmonies is like reading snippets from the life of demi-gods up there in Mount Olympus. The first person fragmented narrative goes anywhere you don\u2019t know what the narrator will tell you next. It could be the chandelier, the contents of the treasure drawer, how much does the king-father loves his mother or his mistress, how the king father searches for his God, how does the father compare to God, etc. There are some bright and shining, amusing and amazing portions but there are also those that a mortal reader like me does not know anything about and just made me feel clueless or even bored. Wiki helped once in a while but there are just some parts that only maybe Hungarian readers know or can appreciate. The book is thick, 880 pages and heavy, first class glossy paper with hardbound cover. Reading it for straight two whole days last weekend should have been an agony for my rheumatic hands but I persisted. Reason? I could not help but read because the life of this former Austro-Hungarian monarchy, the Ezterhazys was just amazingly interesting. It is like being there and watching how a royal, popular and respected European family fell down from their Mt. Olympus with even a member dying along the way because they were so poor. However, this book is not a tearjerker. The narration is strange. I think Peter Esterhazy (born 1950), a scion of the family who is now a mathematician, novelist and a freelance writer, did not write this novel to solicit sympathy. For me, this book just wants to show us how anybody who are rich and famous now could one day, find themselves as poor as rats in the gutters. But Esterhazy, did not, at least in this book, compare his father with the biblical character Job, although his father has deep faith in God and that this faith permeates as the underlying theme of this book. Esterhazy also did not put blame on anybody or anything in particular that led to his family\u2019s downfall. He just tells the story just how it happened but he did not write it like a history book but metaphorically in a magical realism kind of way. If a book has a gender, this is definitely a very manly book. It centers on fathers. Esterhazy used the word father not only in reference to God (the father) and his biological king-father but also his grandfather, or the father\u2019s grandfather, uncles, older brothers, or any father for that matter. Particularly in the first part of the book, readers must decipher whose the father being referred to in some of the portions. It did not put me off, because of Esterhazy\u2019s brilliant play of words; you just interpret his words for yourself. Suit it in any way you want, the outcome is still fascinating if not outright amazing especially when in the end the fragmented narrations fall into their right pieces of the Esterhazy\u2019s long and arduous history as a family.The second part provides a more focused approach as it details the occupation of Hungary by communist, followed by World War II and the eventual takeover of the Soviet Union. So, when you finally close the book, the anchored and definitive second half seems to be enhanced by the fragments of the first part. It like when you clean your leather shoes. If you just brush it without applying shoe polish, it feels like that when you are reading the second part. But as afterthought, if you apply some shoe polish, the shoes shine brighter. But Esterhazy\u2019s style makes it unbelievably interesting because of the sequence: the shine comes first before the shoes. For me, this speaks well of how bright a novelist Esterhazy is."}, {"userName": "Joselito Honestly and Brilliantly", "userReviewDate": "Mar 24, 2010", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/2190636-joselito-honestly-and-brilliantly", "userReview": "When my brother's knee was injured while into competitive sports (naks!) he was operated on at the St. Luke's Medical Center in Quezon City. On the day of his discharge from the hospital he requested me to pick him up as he couldn't then drive by himself.I was able to immediately free myself from my other commitments that day so I drove to the hospital about an hour early. Not wanting to wait too long, I decided to drop by the Booksale store nearby. As I entered the store the first book I saw was this. Hardbound, pages as smooth as a baby's skin, with a borrower's card from the Floral Park Public Library, but without any indication at all that somebody has borrowed, used or read it before.At that time, I was grappling with Donald Barthelme's The Dead Father. It would turn out later that the very last footnote in this book by Peter Esterhazy is his (Esterhazy's) special thanks to the estate of Donald Barthelme for giving him permission to quote extensively from The Dead Father and his expression of admiration for Barthelme's writing.After reading The Dead Father I didn't get to immediately read this book, though. I think I was sort of intimidated by its length and thickness, 846 pages in fine, small print. Somebody smacks you in the head with this and you may get a brain concussion. I thought it would be a tiring read. It was not. What is this book all about? Hungary has a thousand-year history and among the greatest and most powerful aristocrats in this country's past were those of the Esterhazy family, counting among them several princes, military commanders, diplomats, bishops, counts and patrons of the arts. By the mid-20th century, however, the power, prestige and wealth of this family were gone. There was a brief communist takeover in 1919, then the second world war and the eventual Soviet rule. The Esterhazys became enemies of the people and succumbed to dispossession, resettlement and impoverishment.The author's father was born into great wealth and privilege in 1919. But by the time the author himself was born in 1950 the family was already forced to share a house with another family and the author's father was earning very little doing one menial work after another. One of his four children even died while still a baby for lack of good nutrition and proper medical care.A harrowing riches-to-rags theme, supposedly. But it was no tear-jerker. This is a novel of great MELANCHOLIC GAIETY.Divided into two parts, Book 1 has 371 paragraphs of different lengths (from the very, very short to the very, very long). These paragraphs are all about fathers (or almost all, if I missed some which have nothing to do with fathers): the author's father, his father's father, all the other Esterhazy fathers past and present, some non-Esterhazy fathers (paragraph 139 is even about fathers in Philippines--so Pinoy fathers!). And these are fathers of all kinds: good fathers, bad fathers, heroic fathers, fathers who abuse their children, intelligent fathers, stupid fathers, weird fathers, Barthelme's Dead Father, etc.).Book 2 is also numbered (from 1 to 201) but each of the numbers often have two or more paragraphs constituting a mini story. Here we find the story of the downfall of the Esterhazy family who had lost everything (their vast tracks of land, their servants, their palaces and money) except their values, dignity, love of life and--in the case of the author at least--their sense of humor.Why \"Celestial Harmonies\"? Let me hazard a guess. The term \"celestial harmonies\" was used tongue-in-cheek around at least 3 times in the book (as far as I remember). But the real reason could be this: there is a collage of many different \"fathers\" here, and a ton of literary allusions, heavy borrowings of phrases and indirect quotes from works of authors like Barthelme, Samuel Beckett, Saul Bellow, Yasunari Kawabata, John Updike, Nabokov, James Joyce, Frank McCourt (!), Henry Miller, Kenzaburo Oe, George Orwell, Franz Kafka, etc. Great works and voices towering above us all. Celestial. Esterhazy found harmonies in all of them. So, Celestial Harmonies.But that's just my opinion.I have several favorite \"paragraphs\" (Esterhazy, I dunno, call them \"sentences\") here. But let me quote here paragraph 189 from Book 1. Notice the biblical allusion (Moses' land flowing with milk and honey). Notice the sad theme of a father quarelling with the mother. Then notice the humor:\"My father was about to strike my mother, something that--need we add--was nothing out of the ordinary, but then he just shook her head instead (presumably like Christ the shoemaker), and stormed out to the kitchen. He paced up and down, huffing and puffing, abusing my mother under his breath, who (my mother) had just made a general comment regarding the sadness she felt with respect to her life. (Not a reproach or accusation, just the realization of complete failure, which is a reproach and accusation.) My father ripped open the refrigerator door: three milks, one in a bottle, two in plastic bags. He slammed the bottle to the floor, the milk squirting all over the place. In the meantime he was already tearing at the plastic bag with his teeth, forcing the milk out, which squirted in his face, fuck! He fucked it down and trampled it underfoot along with the third bag. The kitchen was awash in the squeaking milk. He took the honey from the cupboard, one tube and one bottle. The bottle--as a matter of custom, we might say--bang!, to the floor, and meanwhile he was forcing the liquid gold from the tube. Drip and stick everywhere. It'd have been good, had my mother sneaked quietly, cautiously out to the kitchen, and watched him rage for a while, whirling round, shirttail hanging out of his pants, everything about him tentative, his gestures, his grimaces, his sentiments, and then she, too, could have joined him, trampling into the new, sweet terrain that was the kitchen, into the guck, and she could have embraced him, whispering, you, you...you land of milk and honey! Instead, my father stormed into the living room, pulled my mother off the sofa--she was huddled there, torn between tears and dry eyes--and as he shoved her toward the kitchen, he shouted, You are going off to the land flowing with milk and honey, but I will not go up in the midst of thee, for thou art a stiff-necked people, lest I consume thee in the way!\"Peter Esterhazy wrote this book in his native language and it was translated to English by Judith Sollosy who wrote a short introduction to it in April 2003 for its publication in the United States ending with this statement:\"I can't help thinking that when the Good Lord created the world in six days and took off for the Bahamas on the seventh, he made a bad mistake. And he knows it. And once in a while, in His infinite boredom, He looks down on us, feels sorry for our plight, and He sends us a Shakespeare, or a Mozart--or a book like 'Celestial Harmonies'.\"And to think I bought this treasure at the Booksale for only Php145.00!"}, {"userName": "\u039f\u03b4\u03c5\u03c3\u03c3\u03ad\u03b1\u03c2 \u039c\u03bf\u03c5\u03b6\u03af\u03bb\u03b7\u03c2", "userReviewDate": "Jul 08, 2017", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/58815268", "userReview": "\u0398\u03b5\u03ca\u03ba\u03cc \u03b2\u03b9\u03b2\u03bb\u03af\u03bf! https://pepperlines.blogspot.gr/2017/..."}, {"userName": "Alana", "userReviewDate": "Aug 21, 2007", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/227903-alana", "userReview": "Hungarians are sexy motherfuckers.

P\u00e9ter Esterh\u00e1zy was born in 1950 in Budapest to one of the most notable noble families of former Austro-Hungarian monarchy. This novel is divided in two parts: the first one is a collection of sentences about Esterh\u00e1zy men since the formal foundation of the family around the end of the 16th century, while the second part has a structure more similar to that of a novel and tells the story of P\u00e9ter himself, his father and his grandfather. I chose this book because I love reading about large families, but I was somewhat disappointed with Celestial Harmonies. If you are like me and don't know a thing about Hungarian history, Wikipedia'll come in handy. It has also an article about the Esterh\u00e1zy family that'll prove useful to have a clear family tree. This didn't make it an easy read. The writing didn't help either. While the style is flowing, precise, intelligent and a little demanding of the reader, it is too experimental for my taste. Sorry, but I can't bear reading page after page of descriptions of family heirlooms. I thought it would pay back somehow, but it didn't. The author talks about some of them all around the book, but that infamous list doesn't enhance the reader's experience in any way. This book was way too long, so long that I was weary before I had finished it.However, I liked some things about the book. I liked the rythm created by the repetition of 'my father' or 'my dear father' in the first part and reading about how the most recent Hungarian history affected the Esterh\u00e1zys, especially about Hungary supporting nazis and then the Soviet republic. I would recommend to anyone who wants to read this book to think of it as a colossal monument to the Esterh\u00e1zy family, instead of a novel. I don't mean this is necessarily a bad book, I would say it is beautiful as a sculpture is. I guess this wasn't the right book for me, since this isn't what I expect of novels."}, {"userName": "Jonfaith", "userReviewDate": "Jun 17, 2010", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/2327886-jonfaith", "userReview": "An astonishing torque of history, memory and language."}, {"userName": "Becky", "userReviewDate": "Jul 14, 2012", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/2341546-becky", "userReview": "My word, that was a chore. 841 pages of literary fanciness, jumpy storytelling, and unsympathetic family issues. I have no idea why this book was written the way it was. I'm not a fan of innovative methods and zany structures. I like a good story I can get my teeth into, and that never happens throughout the length of this book. The first section consists of numbered paragraphs, mostly short but sometimes 3-4 pages in length, all about \"my father.\" But \"My Father\" may be an Esterhazy of any generation from the dark ages to the modern day, he's probably being messed around by some wanton woman, and he may or may not be a nobleman, depending on the era. Just occasionally I hit a hypnotic kind of rhythm with this section, but generally it was arduous and unforgiving. I almost gave up multiple times.The second half follows a more linear story, focussing in on the more modern day history of the family, their fall from grace as communism takes over, and their potential hand in it's downfall. Thankfully this half is a lot more accessible, but the Esterhazy's are never particularly likeable. I'm not sure how much of the story is true and how much is literary invention, I know very little about the nobility of Hungary but man...surely there is an amazing story to be told about a family with such endurance. But this book felt like the band, The Dirty Projectors. If you consider yourself a fan of a certain kind of music, you're supposed to love them.

This novel packs more historical events than any other book I have seen, all written from the point of view of the lastest descendant of the Esterh\u00e1zy family. However, finishing this book left me dissatisfied, and wished I didn't pick up this book in the first place. Let me tell you why.But first, a little attempt at a synopsis. The House of Esterh\u00e1zy is one of the most prominent aristocratic families in Hungary and in Europe. Several generations exist, and the collective histories of these people are told through the eyes of the author, who himself is a descendant of the Esterh\u00e1zy family. Hence, it has the potential to be a historical novel. We see princes, diplomats, aristocrats, and many other political figures come and go. Several hundred years of Hungarian history are covered in this book. However, there is one complication. In an attempt to be artistic and metaphorical, the narrator (presumably the author) portrays all of these as activities done by his Father (with a capital F). Yes, all the previous men belonging to the Esterh\u00e1zy family are portrayed as his collective Father. This makes it sort of cute, in an artistic sense, but as a narrative, this was an utter failure, I believe.For one, it makes it really hard to form a mental representation of the sequence of events. I tried so hard to see how events related to each other, figuring out which one happened first, followed by which one, and so forth. But since every episode is about a Father that may not be exactly the same in real life, then it reaches a point when the reader just gives up all attempts in trying to read this book in a coherent fashion. One suspends all expectations of cohesion. So, once the reader suspends an expectation of cohesion, what happens? The novel suddenly becomes boring. Yes, it is just pages and pages of vignettes, that is just tied together by a loose theme, that is, these are all vignettes about episodes from various members of the Esterh\u00e1zy family. It seems like this is just 840-something pages of text, all written in a stream of consciousness.The thing is, I have nothing against stream of consciousness. In fact, I liked James Joyce's Ulysses. Similar to Ulysses, this book also has plenty of material. Both books are tough books to read. Contrary to Ulysses however, this book covers material from several hundred years, while all the events that Ulysses covered happened in one day. Hence, this results in a bipolar book. One the one hand, it uses artistic devices indicating that this is a literary work of art, but on the other hand, there are just plenty of events covered that it makes it very hard for the reader not to treat it as a historical novel. This divide is particularly evident in the division the author imposed on the text: Book 1 is more a collection of numbered sentences describing events several hundred years ago; while Book 2 covers more the Soviet period as seen by the House of Esterh\u00e1zy. So overall, I came out of this book disappointed, and with a headache, wishing that I never picked this book up in the first place. The literary devices were overused, and the form of narration was incompatible with the material. Instead of appearing as a spectacular piece of literature, it feels more like a transcript of a monologue by a senile individual, someone suffering from Alzheimer's disease, recalling events in his past, in random order. He recalls and retells whatever event he remembers, in no particular order, in no particular causal relation, with no attention whatsoever to whether his stories were coherent or not.

This was a fascinating book about Hungary, fathers, history, and everything else, but I'd be lying if I said I wasn't relieved when Count Esterhazy ran out of pages.I'd read a couple of other Esterh\u00e1zy works, and it's clear he's a much better aphorist than a novelist. His way with words is incredible; there's no writer I can think of apart from Nietzsche who has a better ear for irony and paradox. He's often laugh out loud funny. However, his skill works much better in the context of the brief passages like the ones that make up She Loves Me. Even in his anarchic travelogue The Gaze of Countess Hahn-Hahn (Down the Danube), he struggled to make the work anything more than a collection of hilarious observations and philosophical wordplay.This book is divided evenly into two parts. Book One is a bunch of routines that involve folkloric anecdotes, and it indicates the limitations of Esterh\u00e1zy's style in a novel format. Though thought-provoking and frequently hilarious, it rarely rises above farce. Book Two is the much more personal and linear chronicle of the Esterh\u00e1zy family's diminishing fortunes during the 20th century, and the stories Esterh\u00e1zy tells about his grandfather and parents are brilliantly conceived. While many of the set-pieces (particularly the final episode, a chaotic family outing to a restaurant in Budapest) are wonderful, this time Esterh\u00e1zy manages to weave them into a strange and wonderful whole.Considering how much he included in this gargantuan book, Esterh\u00e1zy unfortunately seems to have left out a lot of relevant material. Conspicuous in its absence is the upheaval of '56 revolution, which one would think would feature prominently in any 20th century Hungarian's family history. And the book only deals with Esterh\u00e1zy himself up to his youth; shouldn't there be more about his later family life that involves his changing relationship with his parents?All in all, a roaring, maddening, delirious success."}, {"userName": "Giselle", "userReviewDate": "Oct 24, 2017", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/3591801-giselle", "userReview": "\"En el curso de la mencionada discusi\u00f3n que apenas era una discusi\u00f3n le esboc\u00e9 a papi -que no me hac\u00eda ni caso- las l\u00edneas esenciales de mi proyecto, especialmente la idea de rescatar la memoria com\u00fan, desde el coro de los \u00e1ngeles hasta el estofado, desde el cardenal P\u00e9ter P\u00e1zmany hasta mi pito, desde mi querida madre hasta mi querido padre, y subray\u00e9 el hecho de que -\u00a1qu\u00e9 pensamiento m\u00e1s bonito!- la memoria de todos es tambi\u00e9n la m\u00eda y la suya, la de mis hermanos, la de los vecinos, la m\u00eda y la del polic\u00eda voluntario, la de todos... y as\u00ed segu\u00ed, soltando todo lo que se me ocurr\u00eda.\" \"132.

I bought my copy from the now defunct playtrade.com.During the past two weeks I have 1) Slept very badly, usually waking up at 2 in the morning and 2) been without a computer. As a result I was able to finish off this weighty tome in a couple of weeks. Saying that I really wasn\u2019t in the mood for reading 900 pages about Hungarian history at this point in time!For those who don\u2019t know the Esterhazy\u2019s are one of Hungary\u2019s most prominent families. Boasting of a lineage which can be traced back to Hungary\u2019s beginnings, Esterhzays have played their part in European history. They have helped cultural icons like Hayden and Bartok with their compositions, been by the side of most of the Hungarian monarchs and even helped out Winston Churchill during the second world war. There\u2019s even a place in Canada called Esterhazy due to one of Peter Esterhazy\u2019s great great uncles moving there in the late 1800\u2019s.All of this is chronicled in Celestial Harmonies (the surname Esterhazy means \u2018of the stars\u2019 so the title has a sort of double meaning)The book itself is divided into two halves. The first section deals with random paragraphs about the beginnings of the Esterhazy clan and as a consequence we get a snapshot of Hungarian history \u2013 time jumps a lot but the majority of this part takes place around the Ottoman war period \u2013 the 1500\u2019s. The second section is a more autobiographical and is more cohesive.Celestial Harmonies is a unique novel. I personally doubt if something like this will ever crop up again. It is, however a very tiring novel and sometimes the scattershot paragraphs in the first section can be a bit irritating. Although I don\u2019t regret reading it (at least know my knowledge on Hungary has improved!), but I cannot say that I loved it. Like I mentioned earlier I wasn\u2019t in the mood for a thick novel and this probably why i\u2019m not too enthusiastic about it. saying that Celestial Harmonies\u2019 importance cannot be overlooked."}, {"userName": "Amerynth", "userReviewDate": "Jul 25, 2012", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/2993355-amerynth", "userReview": "Peter Esterhazy's \"Celestial Harmonies\" is a difficult book for me to rate. I went into it knowing little to nothing about Hungarian history and nothing at all of the Esterhazy family, which apparently was full of filthy rich landowners until the Communists arrived, eager to take the ostentatious Esterhazys down a peg.The novel tells its story in two very separate parts -- the first half in short vignettes telling tales about decades of Esterhazy men, which appears to be a mixture of fact and fable. In the second (and for me, more successful) half, the author focuses on his grandfather, his father and himself, telling stories that again appear to be a blend of true and untrue.I frankly struggled through the book, despite feeling that Esterhazy had a wonderful way with language... there were sentences I just had to read again and a again because they were magical. But also, I felt like the vignettes dragged on -- how many times can you read that the Esterhazy men were womanizers? I came away thinking that I hoped most of the stories were fictional, because they seemed like horrible people.All that said, I did find the portion of the book that focused on the family's downfall -- and forced move from a castle to a peasant's shack -- and their resulting strength and disintegration interesting. Overall, I give the book a sort of middling rating.... it was okay but not something I'd really heartily recommend reading."}, {"userName": "Ian", "userReviewDate": "May 01, 2014", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/4599651-ian", "userReview": "I don't like giving a respected work only one star. It leaves me feelings of guilt and inadequacy: if this book is so well liked, it must be that I am an intellectual pygmy for not appreciating it. It can't be the author's fault - it must be me. But shelving my inferiority complex and my damaging ignorance of Hungarian history, I'm really not convinced this is any good. The first section, 371 numbered sentences, jump-cutting random moments from the history of the author's own illustrious noble family is really heavy going. As he refers to each of the male ancestors as simply \"my father\", it is a real struggle to recognise which century the narrative is centring on. Because it is so fragmented, each time you pick up the book it is as if it is for the very first time: there is no building on the past, which in the tale of a dynastic family, is exactly the opposite effect to what you would have expected. The second half follows a more orthodox narrative, with Esterhazy's own childhood, the Communists having dispossessed the family. But there is a light, whimsical touch to the description of their privations. It does not ring true or strike home. Writing about your own family is a temptation to self-indulgence. Like one of his dissipated ancestors, Esterhazy gives in to this temptation at great length."}, {"userName": "Riet", "userReviewDate": "Feb 21, 2013", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/5691739-riet", "userReview": "Ik lees dit boek nu voor de 2de keer.

De schrijver is een telg uit het beroemde Esterhazy geslacht, die onder de communisten uiteraard alles kwijt geraakt zijn. In de eerste elft van het boek beschtijft hij zijn voorvaderen en noemt daarbij iedere man, van welke generatie dan ook, \"mijn vader\". Het tweede deel gaat echt over zijn ouders en de grote veranderingen voor de hele familie onder het communisme.

If Helping Verbs of the Heart was an homage to his mother, then this is a memorial to his father. It is actually two works in one. Book 1, \"Numbered Sentences from the Life of the Esterh\u00e1zy Family\", comprises 371 paragraphs, some elusively succinct, others pages long, that amount to a gloriously kaleidoscopic romp through the centuries that lie behind this European dynasty. Not that the name Esterh\u00e1zy is ever uttered: the main protagonist of each episode is invariably identified as \"my father\", whether he is an anti-Habsburg Kuruc insurrectionist or a Habsburg-loyal Labanc, a hammer of the Ottomans, a dying old man, a prisoner of war, a lord charming enough to enchant Goethe himself, or a childless man, to mention but a few of \"my fathers\", all evoked through the language and literature proper to each persona. This strategy of anonymity allows Esterh\u00e1zy to extend his typically vast net of quotations to sources that originally have no family connotations whatsoever, thereby lending broader significance to the particulars of this one family, however grand, and, vice versa, appropriating the general (European) experience to the family's specific circumstances. The baroquely exuberant proliferation of anecdotal gleanings and fragments of real and fictional history, drawing on a gamut of written genres, from maxims to parables, from confessional autobiography to the account books and chronicles, is ultimately threaded together by an unobtrusive, profoundly witty and wise philosophical vein.Book 2, subtitled \"Confessions of an Esterh\u00e1zy family\", is ostensibly a more conventional family novel. Its very subtitle alludes to an earlier Hungarian masterpiece of the genre, Confessions of a Bourgeois, 1934-35 by S\u00e1ndor M\u00e1rai. It consists of a series of snapshots of key events in the lives of the author's great-grandfather, grandfather, father and the young Esterh\u00e1zy himself. These are built up, over two hundred numbered passages, into a more or less chronological portrait of a century-and-a-half of steady decline of the family's fortunes. After 1945 the Esterh\u00e1zys suffered an almost catastrophic repeat of the confiscations and curtailment of liberties that befell them during the short-lived Commune of 1919 one that not only stripped them of their former rank and privileges but threatened their very subsistence. Largely anecdotal and often absurd in tone, much of this is recounted with great gusto from the author's personal perspective, not least the stories of his own childhood, such as being accidentally dropped into the baptismal font; the trek to a godforsaken village in July 1950 when an official deportation order resulted in the family being dumped in one of two rooms in a peasant couple's house; schooldays and trips to matches with his football-mad father. For all the vicissitudes and uncertainties it describes, the tone of the writing throughout is one of blithely upbeat humour and harmony, without a hint of reproach, regret or complaint.\"A captivatingly rich novel in terms of both its form and its stance. Certainly it is the most striking work of the fifty-year-old author's career to date, and I would evenventure to call it an epitome of the Esterh\u00e1zy oeuvre.
