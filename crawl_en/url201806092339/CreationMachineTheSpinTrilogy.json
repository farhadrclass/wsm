Transworld publishers.It's definitely not my genre. In for a penny in for a pound, I thought, OK I'll read this as they have sent it.I started to read the first couple of chapters and went on through to the end. I never review a book unless I've read it throughout. That's my personal rule.So I am rating this fairly on genre, quality, believability and from a reading perspective NOT judgement in \" this isn't my cup of tea\" it wasn't. But based on the role slot this book holds genre wise it's a really good read.It does read like an opera, but spacey ( is that a word!) I understood it completely and enjoyed it, but I certainly wouldn't want to read the following books due to it not being my taste.It's like enjoying a cake, it's edible, it's pleasing but....it's not your favourite. I hope that makes sense.For those that love this type of read, it's very good ( I'm a novice in this field) but it took my interest."}, {"userName": "Liviu", "userReviewDate": "Jan 24, 2016", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/1229019-liviu", "userReview": "read a few pages so far and I really like it - strong vibes from Against a Dark Background which is by far my favorite non-Culture novel of IMB - if it keeps like that, it should be a top 10 novel of the yearfinished the novel and it was excellent though a little short of mind-blowing for two reasons:- it is really short as space opera goes (~300 pages) and it is a complete book with a definite ending as the Spin Trilogy moves 10k years in the future in the next installment, so this is it with these characters, story-line etc- the bad guys are really over the top caricatures to a large extent - there is some subtlety towards the end, but main bad guy Alameche (a sort of Beria in space but considerably more brutal as his death count is in billions being in sf and all) becomes a bit of a bore soon enough, though again things turn somewhat more interesting with him later onhowever, the good points - narrative power so the novel cannot be put down and I essentially finished it in one setting after reading the first few pages several days ago, lots of cool stuff (tech, names, back story)), inventiveness etc - overwhelm the negatives above and I thoroughly enjoyed it though for a space opera debut with great potential i still rate last year's Promise of the Child by T. Toner betterstill highly recommended and I am definitely in for the next book in the trilogy (Iron Gods or so) after reading the novel (or before but I think one gets much more after) the interview with the author from sffworld is excellent and illuminatinghttp://www.sffworld.com/2016/05/inter..."}, {"userName": "Stephen", "userReviewDate": "Jun 16, 2017", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/8201780-stephen", "userReview": "Creation Machine reads like and amalgam of the best space opera: Iain Banks expansive world building (comparisons to him in the cover blurbs are spot on), Alastair Reynolds for the spacey bits, even the simulated worlds of Hannu Rajaniemi. Fast paced, fun. A great debut with only a few misses. The villains--The Fortunate--are rather cartoony; Alameche in particular too evil to feel real. Some unnecessary and distractingly crude sex references. And I'm not sure I fully understand the ending. Even so, loved it! As reader Livui notes strong vibes of Iain Banks Against a Dark Background.

We discover that she becomes part of a military programme to become enhanced and then the obliteration of Soc O and the declaring illegal of enhanced people like Fleare.But most of all we read of Fleare\u2019s present \u2013 her escape from her imprisonment, and her fugitive run from Odel\u2019s Moon to Thale and the Catastrophe Curve, which leads to her meeting up with her ex-comrades (Kelk, Muz and Jez) and enemies.To broaden the picture a little, at the same time we also get a wider view of the artificial galaxy known as The Spin through Alameche, a character whose role as viceroy to the Emperor \u2013 sorry, the Patriarch \u2013 in the empire of The Fortunate, is one best suited to his rather extreme tastes. He is the sort of character who makes Darth Vader seem like a novice, the sort of person who will kill people for fun, with no reason other than to kill them. There\u2019s clearly something afoot and the ambitious Alameche is given charge to make sure that the Patriarch knows what\u2019s going on. This involves schemes and counter-schemes amongst the social hierarchy, and ultimately the mysterious and pretty unknown creators of The Spin, the artificial galaxy where all this happens. For one of their ancient machines has been found \u2013 and it is coming back to life\u2026It\u2019s been a long time since I read a novel in nearly one sitting, and even longer since it was a debut. I started reading this one on its arrival and couldn\u2019t put it down, finishing the book in a weekend. Andrew\u2019s book delivers in spades everything I\u2019m looking for in a Space Opera \u2013 imaginative settings, strange aliens, an arsenal of unusual weapons, and, most of all, characters I like and who I want to know what happens to them. This is a book that is fast-paced and stylish, but not one where its literary merits outweigh its sheer enthusiasm and sense of enjoyment.It reminded me of the first Peter F. Hamilton I read in its sense of epic-ness, or the first Iain (M.) Banks I read in its intelligent plotting and its sense of humour. I particularly liked the fact that I recognised lots of old-school touches \u2013 the huge alien devices (BDO\u2019s), the various alien species, the different environments the characters travel through \u2013 but this is undoubtedly something new \u2013 21st century Space Opera, with knowing nods and winks to the past and a few contemporary expletives thrown in for good measure.Whilst the book has a tight focus, it does have the feel of being part of a bigger picture. There\u2019s strange flora and fauna (including a very memorable and deliberately unpleasant type of mega-eel), and journeys from rainforest to desert, from iceworlds to lava fields which give you a feel of the multitude of potential locations within the Spin.I was a bit put off initially by the title, which gave me the impression that the novel was going to be yet another philosophical debate on gods and AI. But I was very, very wrong. In the end it\u2019s more like Jack McDevitt\u2019s Engines of God, where the BIG alien objects do not outweigh the quality of the characterisation. The characters made me think of Dan Simmons\u2019s Endymion, as they became people I cared for as I read. Fleare became as memorable to me as Anaea did in Simmons\u2019 Endymion novels, and her relationship with Muz is a joy (though not always easy).The latter part of the book leads to things going all Neuromancer, and whilst there is an ending, like Endymion it is clear that there\u2019s more to tell in the next book.In short, I can\u2019t recommend this one highly enough. There\u2019s the odd slight misstep \u2013 it loses a point from me for a badly made and ill-timed dildo joke in the first few pages \u2013 but otherwise it does everything I expect, and admirably. In short, Creation Machine is the best Space Opera I\u2019ve read in ages.A surprisingly good debut \u2013 this one should be a monster."}, {"userName": "Tyler", "userReviewDate": "Oct 21, 2016", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/3938670-tyler", "userReview": "Andrew Bannister's Creation Machine is a debut space opera first-in-a-trilogy.Some great ideas and passages of the novel, very (Iain) Banksian in feel (which many others have commented), but I wasn't greatly impressed overall.

Aber so gar nicht. Es hat sich so sch\u00f6n angelesen, sich dann aber in R\u00fcckblenden in R\u00fcckblenden in R\u00fcckblenden verloren \u2026 Und nun bin ich komplett verwirrt. Auf \u00fcber 400 Seiten habe ich versucht zu verstehen, was der Spin ist (eine Illustration w\u00e4re sehr hilfreich gewesen), was die zahlreichen technischen Ger\u00e4te und Gef\u00e4hrte nun sein k\u00f6nnen (sie erhalten keine Beschreibung, nur einen neuen Namen) und die H\u00e4lfte der Zeit war mir nicht klar, warum die beiden Protagonisten tun, was sie taten. Am Ende war mir nicht klar, was eigentlich passiert war und warum die allm\u00e4chtige Hegemonie auf einmal zerst\u00f6rt war.Auch die Kapitel, die in dieser simulierten Welt spielten, haben meinen Kopf nur rauchen lassen. Ich m\u00f6chte anf\u00fcgen, dass ich durchaus technisch versiert bin und schon viel Erfahrung im Science-Fiction-Genre habe. Aber dieses Buch glich von der Anstrengung her, es zu lesen, eher einem meiner Fachb\u00fccher \u00fcber die mittel\u00e4gyptische Grammatik. Ja, die habe ich besser verstanden.Also was ist da jetzt eigentlich passiert und was war die mysteri\u00f6se Maschine?Jetzt habe ich noch kein Wort \u00fcber die Charaktere verloren. Recht sp\u00e4t kriegt man doch raus, was ihre Motivation ist. Aber dabei bleiben sie f\u00fcr mich oberfl\u00e4chlich, ein wenig wie Statisten, um dieses seltsame Universum zu f\u00fcllen und weniger, um ihre Geschichte zu erz\u00e4hlenDer Klappentext klingt deutlich spannender, als der Inhalt des Buches, wenn er auch meiner Meinung nach diesen etwas falsch wiedergibt.

Here the tone of the book became clear: it is eccentric, unapologetically soft sci fi (which is good). But also a bit facile - mainly in the character interactions.Then I started to get into it. An austere space opera it is not. In fact it is a very British book (which is fine for me because I'm British!), it's just the tone doesn't present itself from the blurb or art at all. In many ways it reminds me, within the limits of my experience of the following authors, of Ian Banks and Philip Palmer. Whether that is a good or bad thing is up to you. In the case of Palmer I found his books unsatisfactory but the writing excellent. I haven't got terribly far with Ian Banks for some reason. But that's no reflection on his work. So the story: rebellious heiress escapes from prison while nasty space aristocrat discovers a powerful artifact. All set in an artificial galaxy of improbable quality. The environments change quite spectacularly, however the story did lose me toward the end.To be honest I think the book is the right length (300-450 pages is my sweet spot), but the pacing was odd. It resolves and I'm not entirely sure how. There is an obvious betrayal and then...the bad guys get their comeuppance with no real action from the rebellious heiress. I feel like I missed something. Perhaps that was my fault. I sometimes struggle to pay attention due to having rubbish eye sight. The writing style is breezy, efficient. It is witty and dutiful, but not overbearing. I do think that the book could have done with a broader tone. This problem is reflected in the characters' dialogue. The main characters quip a bit too much, and it feels almost a touch self referential as if the author is trying to convince you that the story has a particular tone. The bad guy is somewhat over the top. In fact that is a quality of the entire setting - which is fine, but tiring.I'm undecided if I want to continue. A little distance from the book will help make up my mind."}, {"userName": "Paul Trembling", "userReviewDate": "Mar 24, 2018", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/52003710-paul-trembling", "userReview": "Comparisons with Ian M Banks 'Culture' series are inevitable. 'Creation Machine' has the same huge vision of time and space, encompassing vast time spans and huge interstellar vistas. It also has the same wide range of brilliantly imagined and vividly described cultures, technologies and ecologies as its backdrop.However, this is not a slavish imitation of Banks. Bannister's 'Spin Worlds' are a unique and distinctive creation, a fascinating concept which is also, as it turns out, integral to the plot. Said plot is a complex one, and sprawls over the immense background, taking full advantage of the inherent possibilities of such a big picture. (Again, reminiscent of Banks). It involves multiple characters, many of them unpleasant but all of them fascinating and well developed and if I sometimes found it hard to keep track of everything that was going on (it's probably not best to read this in short snippets - give yourself time to read large chunks of it at a sitting, that's my advice) the entire reading experience was far too absorbing to backtrack, and the wordflow was too smooth to encourage that anyway.The conclusion was both climatic and satisfying. There were a few loose ends that I would have liked tied up, but that's my personal preference: unresolved issues may be more true to life, but I like things neatly cut and dried! Apart from that any criticism would be nit-picking: this is an excellent piece of SF, full of colour and life and big ideas. I'm certainly hoping to read the next book in the series ASAP."}, {"userName": "Nigel Owen", "userReviewDate": "May 11, 2018", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/25514520-nigel-owen", "userReview": "I liked the start the setting felt original and the characters were interesting.We then have flash backs to explain why the books main character Fleare Haas, the stereotypical rich girl, is rebelling against her father and the society she was bought up in.The society is a \"super capitalist\" nightmare controlled by the rich elite who abuse there positions of power. I thought the main characters motivation was pretty childish she has almost zero experience of how bad the society is and joins up with the rebels to fight against this society.She then manages to traverse across this society simply looking for her \"friends\" while being public enemy no, throw in a bit of narrative POV from other characters to show how bad the society is and finally no real conclusion which I assume this is in the later books in the series.While this book is obviously science fiction, I found any world building pretty lame the story slow and the plot and characters ridiculous.3 stars as the idea of the spin was original, the book blurb sounded good and does resemble the actual book."}, {"userName": "James", "userReviewDate": "Dec 15, 2017", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/3133482-james", "userReview": "An extremely competent debut novel.

Genocide, simulated realities, nano-tech, space travel \u2013 all the staples of the sci-fi genre are present. Creation Machine isn't anything particularly new, but what it does, it does well or at least competently.The story alternates perspectives with each chapter, usually switching between the action heavy sections of the main character, Fleare and the more sedate, political intrigue sections of the central antagonist, Alameche. Chapters are often short which not only helps to maintain the pace established by Fleare's story but also means the slower paced scenes don't outstay their welcome. Bannister does a great job at maintaining this balance throughout the novel.While there isn't a great deal of depth to the characters, there is enough to engage the reader and enough in Bannister's descriptions of their mannerisms and behaviour in any given scene to make them realistic and easily relatable. In this regard, even the minor characters have a good level of believability.While the characterisation is generally strong enough to carry the story, Fleare, as the protagonist, isn't quite as active as I would have hoped for. The initial chapters gave me hope that she would be a strong, engaging lead, but as things progress, she seems to fall into the background and is carried along by the events and characters around her. However, her relationship with Muz is nicely handled; it isn't as black and white as other aspects of the story and seems genuinely heart-felt the more we learn more about it.Alameche, while effective enough as a central antagonist was largely one dimensional, defined entirely by his extreme sadism and egocentricity and acting essentially as a typical Bond villain, i.e. someone the reader can dislike unreservedly. Like the other characters, there isn't too much depth to Alameche, but his actions and idiosyncrasies are still believable and he serves his purpose of providing a counter balance to Fleare's character while adding a more suspenseful aspect to the story and driving the plot forward.The world-building is very effective throughout, and is probably one of my favourite aspects of Creation Machine. There's a lot of variety in the settings from a city built from the remnants of ancient war machines to salt caverns and a space ship maintaining its own jungle ecosystem. The Spin itself is well developed throughout the book as the characters visit the various locations and worlds. Bannister doles out the information carefully, introducing new areas with a brief description and history before carrying on with the story, doing well to avoid info-dumps. While the story does have its darker moments, namely Alameche's chapters, the story generally maintains a light-hearted tone throughout with jokes shared between characters and some colourful descriptions of the worlds and locations within the Spin. The humour might not be for some as it is generally quite base, though it isn't too obtrusive.Overall, an enjoyable, easy read. Creation Machine will probably work for most fans of space opera."}, {"userName": "reherrma", "userReviewDate": "Jan 23, 2017", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/40861724-reherrma", "userReview": "Im ersten Teil der Spin-Trilogie beschreibt Bannister eine Geschichte in ferner Zukunft, welche in einem Gebiet aus 21 Sonnen besteht, um die 89 bewohnbare Planeten kreisten.

And yet they\u2019re all very believable backdrops. Indeed, author Andrew Bannister\u2019s exemplary world building brings a sense of awe to The Creation Machine \u2013 you can\u2019t help but marvel at his descriptive prowess, something we hope continues in the two planned sequels.If the interstellar locations weren\u2019t enough to convince you of how intricate a space opera Bannister\u2019s debut novel is, then the characters, which include a sentient cloud, a multitude of intriguing lifeforms and modified humans, will surely charm.With so much unique detail spanning the residents of the Spin it\u2019s easy to be enthralled. But there\u2019s always a seemingly dissimilar event happening one after another, and it\u2019s difficult trying to tie them together, if at all. It\u2019s clear that this is due to the swift and unapologetic action. You are dropped in medias res at every interval, and it certainly takes some getting used to.It seems like Bannister is trying to make up for this, often by providing either too much narrative information or by shoeing in the characters\u2019 dialogue for a cheap and cheerful explanation. It comes across as fragmented, with the structure only starting to take shape around two thirds into the book.Still, if you stick with The Creation Machine, you will find a beautiful space opera trilogy that\u2019s just waiting to explode in a well-crafted first attempt, ready for future stories."}, {"userName": "Ian", "userReviewDate": "Apr 17, 2016", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/1231281-ian", "userReview": "This one seems to be getting quite a push from Bantam (they were giving away free ARCs at Eastercon). First impression\u2026 well, it\u2019s very Banksian. And that can\u2019t be bad. The action takes place in the Spin, an \u201cartificial galaxy\u201d, although no real sense of the size or scale of this galaxy is apparent in the book. The heroine, Fleare Haas, who struck me as very much in a smiliar vein to Banks\u2019s Lady Sharrow, is the daughter of the plutocrat who pretty much runs the Hegemony, the Spin\u2019s most powerful government. She tried fighting against him in a breakaway army, but that ended badly. As the book opens, she\u2019s a prisoner of an enigmatic ruin on one of the Spin\u2019s worlds. She\u2019s then rescued by an ex-colleague who is a cloud of nanobots (one of the novel\u2019s more inventive elements), because she\u2019s needed to prevent the Hegemony from doing something stupid with a powerful artefact that may be left over from the machine that built the Spin. That artefact is currently in the hands of a brutal regime which occupies a handful of worlds in the centre of the artificial galaxy. It\u2019s all very twenty-first century space opera, very readable, quite inventive, with a slight twist of Banks and a mordant, albeit far more sweary, wit\u2026 But it\u2019s also a space opera universe in which capitalism runs everything, and slavery, torture and brutality seem the default setting\u2026 In fact, there are no redeeming features to the societies depicted in the Spin. And I have to wonder, why would someone write a book like this? It feels like an attempt to writer a grimdark space opera \u2013 but since I think grimdark is a horrible thing, I can think of no good reason why anyone would want to do the same in space opera. I suspect this book will do quite well, but I\u2019ll not be bothering with the sequels."}, {"userName": "yangsta", "userReviewDate": "May 28, 2016", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/24654447-yangsta", "userReview": "What a major disappointment! I was really psyched up by the Guardian sci fi book review about this epic space opera. But NO! It's about a rich spoilt girl turned \"rebel\" cos CEO Daddy wanted to move on from mummy's death and have a new wife. Enough of the selfishness and get over your sulkiness! She has no skill, no personality, and gets muscle aches and stuff. Nothing interesting about her other than being an annoying brat! Then a coup that took the ENTIRE book to not happen until the last 10 pages or so! All the characters are pretty much one-dimensional, yep, a sulky heiress that gets carried along the plot, rather than creating any, and she is the main character solely because... she's got a rich Daddy and she does't like him, and don't worry, she'll keep reminding you and everyone she talks to!! And she still calls her hateful rich father \"Daddy\" in the book after all that. What kind of grown woman who hates her father still.... Anyways, and a hitler style wiz kid turned cruel viceroy and his equally useless boss... Jumping story-lines, back and forth, here and there. Don't care. Where's the rest of the artificial galaxy? It's a galaxy for fk sake, surely there's gotta be something better to tell. And they still have cab drivers in this galaxy?! Errrrrgh..... If you have intelligent autonomous space ships, and cloud/shape-changing existence mode, you can have driverless flying cars. Then maybe that whiny heiress can finally make herself useful by giving some cool birds eye view description of the place!"}, {"userName": "Merrytoad", "userReviewDate": "Aug 03, 2016", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/18819332-merrytoad", "userReview": "Fantastic thank you Mr Bannister for giving me a really good classic SF story to read, lots of good characters not all goodies, lots of locations and SF tech to keep the story flowing, I very very much look forward to reading so sequels.After having read a number of so so stories over the last couple of months it was nice to have a \"I can't put this down story.\"Received for free from publisher via netgalley in exchange for an honest review"}, {"userName": "Xavi", "userReviewDate": "Feb 27, 2016", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/20932562-xavi", "userReview": "The author has a great imagination and has created a fantastic universe, but he opens many fronts and adds many layers to the story and finally it has escaped from his hands and has failed to convincingly connect everything.Full review in english: http://dreamsofelvex.blogspot.com/201...Full review in spanish: http://dreamsofelvex.blogspot.com/201..."}, {"userName": "Phil Bird", "userReviewDate": "Oct 01, 2016", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/22538728-phil-bird", "userReview": "I enjoyed this book, it has good depth and variety.
