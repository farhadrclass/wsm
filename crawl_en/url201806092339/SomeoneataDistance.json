She's selfish, manipulating and heartless and right from the beginning you can't help but feel great distaste for her. As an opponent to Louise we have Ellen who is the wife of Avery and has two lovely children. How the story of Louise and Ellen is mingled, I won't give away, but this novel turns out to become a novel of love, despair and everything in between."}, {"userName": "Emer ", "userReviewDate": "Sep 26, 2016", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/4629647-emer", "userReview": "Fantastic!!! Just fantastic. This is EXACTLY the kind of book I love to read. \nIntelligent writing that is poignant yet witty. \nThe perfect combination. Someone at a Distance is one of those novels that overtime was forgotten and lay languishing in some dusty corner of the literary world until those wise people at Persephone Books reissued it as one of the books in their Classics series. And how delighted I am that they did! I had never heard of the author Dorothy Whipple until I stumbled across this book in my library and she has fast tracked her way to my must-read authors list. The story is a classic one. It's all about relationships; be it those within marriage and family or those within the community and the workplace. It's about how they impact on who we are and on the decisions we make. It's about their formation and their breakdown. It's about how someone at a distance can affect the lives of people they never even meet. Cause and effect. \n\"They stood in the morning sunlight, looking at each other, and from her mother's face she learned that the grown-up world was not what she had thought it was, not a place of power and fulfilment, but a place of helplessness, pain and ugliness. Until now, she had run joyfully forward, but now she was halted. She shrank back. She had learnt suspicion and distrust and most of all the fear of life that sickens the youthful heart and from which it takes so long to recover.\"\nThis novel was first published in the early 1950s and has a lovely old world charm to it. However it still feels relevant today because of the realistic characters and genuine emotion contained within its pages. The feelings that people experienced and shaped their view of the world in the 1950s are still those same feelings that we feel today and impact on our lives in 2016. Human emotion is timeless. And this book is laden with human emotion and complex characters. I couldn't recommend this book more highly to you if you are looking for a quiet yet truly captivating read. This book is almost unassuming in its execution. It is stealthy how it hooks you and then reels you into the storyline and suddenly you are feeling everything with these beautifully written characters; their highs and their lows. You begin to question the motives of every character. You question complacency versus desire and the sometimes catastrophic fallout from both. What I love most about this book is how no one is truly guilty come the end but yet no one is blameless either. And isn't that humanity in a nut shell? No one is perfect. Every one is fatally flawed and none so much as the characters herein. I found myself getting so completely and utterly involved and fully invested in these characters that there were points when reading that I punched my book in an effort to fist-bump what was happening in the storyline! Fist-bumping a modern classic??? What a great way to spend a Sunday afternoon! Highly recommendedfour and a half stars rounded up to five \n\"She had learnt something from those last lonely weeks. She had learnt to wait for the changes and the help that life brings. Life is like the sea, sometimes you are in the trough of the wave, sometimes on the crest. When you are in the trough, you wait for the crest, and always, trough or crest, a mysterious tide bears you forward to an unseen, but certain shore.\""}, {"userName": "Susan", "userReviewDate": "Jun 07, 2018", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/5837456-susan", "userReview": "I have never read Dorothy Whipple before, although I have come across her name many times; especially on the podcast, \u201cTea or Books?\u201d When this title was suggested on a book group I belong to, I read it with interest.Published in 1953, this is not my typical read, but I was immediately drawn in. It is the story of the North family \u2013 wife Ellen, publisher husband, Avery, their son Hugh, who is doing National Service and horse obsessed daughter, Anne, who is still at school. Avery\u2019s demanding mother lives nearby and, bored and resentful, she decides to invite a young Frenchwoman to stay.Louise Lanier is the beloved daughter of a bookseller and his wife. She is spoiled, vicious and utterly self-obsessed. Although she is beautiful, she is rejected by the richest young man of her provincial town, who, having enjoyed an affair with her, marries a woman more of his social class and Louise is keen to get away. So, she goes to stay with Mrs North in England and ingratiates herself with the old woman, while upsetting everyone else.Ellen, who loves her garden, her family and her quiet, comfortable life, fails to see the danger that Louise represents. When she catches Avery embracing her, the situation quickly gets out of hand. Avery, humiliated, feels that he has no choice but to leave. Ellen, who having spent her life being a wife, and a mother, is left bereft and abandoned and has to make a new life.I am a wife and a mother, and have been so for many years, so I must admit my sympathies were all with Ellen.

Their self sufficiency causes resentment in Avery's mom and she starts complaining they (especially Ellen) doesn't pay attention to her. She advertises for a companion and the ad is answered by a French woman named Louise.Then follow an interesting set of events, that question the marriage, trust and family bonds.

It had a luscious painting on the cover, and was otherwise gray. I found myself holding a beautifully constructed paperback, with wallpaper from the era of the original printing of the book on endpages. It was just what I was looking for.It was a copy of Dorothy Whipple\u2019s Someone at a Distance, originally published in 1953, reprinted by Persephone Books in London.I am relatively late in discovering Persephone, as is evidenced by a couple of Bookslut posts here and here. And this Stuck in a Book blog post.Now I feel as if I have stumbled upon a huge treat, and I can\u2019t wait to get my hands on more of Persephone\u2019s dovegray reprints. Persephone Books is dedicated to reprinting \u201cforgotten twentieth century novels, short stories, cookery books and memoirs by (mostly) women writers.\u201d Persephone Books\u2019 reprints are for \u201cthe discerning reader who prefers books that are neither too literary nor too commerical, and are guaranteed to be readable, thought-provoking and impossible to forget.\u201dThat, my dears, is quite the mission statement. Persephone Books is the brainchild of publisher Nicola Beauman. Her book, A Very Great Profession: The Woman\u2019s Novel 1914-39, originally published by Virago Press, explores the writings of many of the authors Persephone Books now republishes.What makes me so smitten? These are authors who deserve to be rediscovered, celebrated and discussed. Dorothy Whipple\u2019s Someone at a Distance blew me away. Its simple premise, the dissolution of a marriage, is drawn in a subtle, skillful way. Whipple draws you into post-War rural England with an artist\u2019s hand, taking you into the lives of the North family with deft, compassionate insight. The principal characters are Avery and Ellen North. Avery works in London at a publishing house, and his wife, Ellen, a woman happily consumed with the daily tasks of keeping house. Ellen has little interest in entertaining or attending the literary events at Avery\u2019s work. Even though it might be her duty as a publisher\u2019s wife, she soon realized that \u201cshe didn\u2019t look important and nobody wondered who she was,\u201d and decided she was not missed.Avery and Ellen and their two children lead an idyllic life. It is to all eyes a charmed family. But everything changes when Old Mrs. North, Avery\u2019s demanding mother, hires a French girl, Louise, as a companion and language coach. Louise is a fine piece of work, a girl smarting from an affair to a man in a higher social class in her hometown, who is hellbent on exacting her revenge\u2013success. One Louise sets her sights on Avery, things get complicated.Whipple explores family relationships, human motives and happiness with the kind of compassion and finesse that you don\u2019t see nearly as readily in contemporary fiction.I should mention that Persephone Books may not be easy to find. Some of them are available in America, but others you will have to order. If your book group is looking for some forgotten classics, it is well worth the hunt.

Their happiness is the envy of everyone. They seem to be in a world of their own, so happy they hardly need anyone else. Yet, the flaws in this overt happiness become visible as Louise, a French girl, enters their lives as Avery\u2019s mother\u2019s companion, with an objective to disrupt their relationships. As Avery gets attracted to Louise and makes mistake after mistake, his true selfishness in regards to his family is revealed along with Louise\u2019s callousness.Truthfully, at first I found Someone at a Distance very difficult to get into \u2013 the \u2018domestic\u2019 details seemed tiresome to me. However, as the \u2018big event\u2019 happened \u2013 the turning point in the book where Ellen and Avery\u2019s marriage breaks down - that is when I truly started to get into it because this is such a deeply insightful albeit a painful exploration of a family breaking down and a realistic character portrait of those involved.I loved the powerful exploration of gender roles in a marriage. I was very pleasantly surprised, given that this was written more than fifty years ago \u2013 while there are no clear indications of the author\u2019s feminist stand point, the reader is very clear of where the author\u2019s sympathies lie simply through her portrayals of Ellen and Louise. I found Ellen pitiable and frustrating at the same time - her disregard of herself, her utter devotion to her family, her blindness to her husband\u2019s laziness in regards to domestic duties and to his immaturity. Unfortunately, this still happens to be a current reality in many cases. At the same time, I found her strength and perseverance very empowering. So, when the marriage of twenty years which had defined her absolutely, collapses, the effect on her is devastating and author\u2019s depiction of it is often too real to read at a go. She questions everything about her identity \u2013 Who am I without my family? What am I to do? It\u2019s like she is left without a foundation, her identity torn from her. As she slowly starts to rebuild her life along with that of her children, it\u2019s a sense of hope that permeates into the reader as you champion her on.I have confused feelings about Louise. At some points, the author depicts her with so much sympathy \u2013 making her seem more gray than purely evil by showing the context to her sense of vengefulness against everyone; at other points, she is too one dimensionally (in this otherwise complex novel) portrayed as the \u2018home wrecker\u2019 without any sympathies. However, I did end up somewhat understanding her. Louise, in an era where nothing lay for women other than the promise of \u2018blissful domesticity\u2019, is an ambitious young woman who wants more and demands more from her life \u2013 yet, the only way she finds to do that is by wrecking people\u2019s lives and breaking her parents\u2019 hearts. You sometimes understand her anger and her feeling of suffocation. She has delusions of grandeur in regards to herself and her future \u2013 in the end, her illusions are the only things that she has to hold to on as she faces the reality.In some ways, both Ellen and Louise are in prisons. Ellen is blissfully unaware of the prison that surrounds her, while Louise is aware and actively fights against it through often unacceptable ways. Both women are essentially prisoners of misogynistic norms and expectations.The book also makes you question \u2013 in a marriage or a family in general, whose role is to maintain the relationships? Just the women\u2019s? Why? You see Avery\u2019s sense of freedom as he takes his family and Ellen for granted, you see him carelessly play the victim after his infidelity is discovered, and you feel outraged at him.The depiction of a once happy and bustling home silenced is so beautiful, as evident in this paragraph:\u201cAll incoming and outgoing tide of movement had ceased. The tradesmen\u2019s vans stood no longer at the gate. No cheerful cry of \u2018fish\u2019 or \u2018baker\u2019 sounded at the back door. One bottle of milk stood solitary at the step where there had been whole companies. The telephone never rang. Nobody came to the door; even charity-collectors passed her by; perhaps because they were too embarrassed to face her\u2026\u201d In the end, the central plot is very simple, but that is what makes the novel so easy to empathize with , as you keep thinking about your own seemingly strong familial relationships. You ask \u2013 Are relationships really this fragile? Can something that seems so strong and sacred break up in a span of a few minutes?A complex novel written by an unfairly forgotten author, Someone at a Distance is something I would definitely recommend.

I adore the books which they publish, and for me, they are one of the most important publishing houses which exists today. Dorothy Whipple is an author who seems to be one of the most adored on the Persephone list, and I was eager to begin another of her novels. Someone at a Distance was first published in 1953.Someone at a Distance is introduced by Nina Bawden, an author whose work I very much enjoy. She writes of how much she admires Whipple\u2019s work, and says this about the novel: \u2018[it] is, on the face of it, a fairly ordinary tale of a deceived wife and a foolish husband in rural suburbia not far from London and, perhaps because the author was nearing sixty when she wrote it, there is a slight pre-war flavour about the domestic expectations of the characters\u2019. Bawden goes on to say that \u2018Whipple is a storyteller in the straightforward tradition of J.B. Priestley and Arnold Bennett rather than Virginia Woolf or Elizabeth Bowen\u2019.I was beguiled from the novel\u2019s very beginning. The opening chapter sets the tone of the whole wonderfully: \u2018Widowed, in the house her husband had built with day and night nurseries and a music-room, as if the children would stay there for ever, instead of marrying and going off at the earliest possible moment, old Mrs. North yielded one day to a long-felt desire to provide herself with company. She answered an advertisement in the personal column of The Times'. A young Frenchwoman, Louise Lanier, determined to spend the summer in England, is its author. Of her newest venture, Mrs North says the following: \u2018\"At my age, I don\u2019t expect fun\u2026 But I hope it will be interesting. I\u2019m too old to go in search of change, so I\u2019ll try to bring change into the house. It\u2019s too quiet as it is.\u201d'As with a lot of the books on the Persephone list, Someone at a Distance is a familial novel. Avery North, son of the formidable matriarch, is a publisher. Ellen, his wife, is focused upon, and she is one of the most realistic constructs whom I have come across in fiction in such a long time: \u2018Guiltily, pleasurably, she avoided the parties Bennett and North gave for authors, agents and the like\u2026 everybody talked vociferously, and though here and there people moved aside, smiling, to let her pass, nobody interrupted conversation for her. Slight, fair, with no idea at all of trying to make an impression, she didn\u2019t look important and nobody wondered who she was\u2019.Whipple exemplifies the changing times within society marvellously: \u2018Maids had disappeared from the domestic scene long ago\u2026 Ellen now did as her neighbours did and employed day, or, more properly, half-day, women\u2019. We learn both about the North family, and headstrong Louise Lanier, as she finds her feet. Whipple\u2019s description of her is vivid from the very first: \u2018Her lips were made up, even for breakfast, in a magenta colour, which nevertheless matched the varnish on the nails of her narrow hands\u2026 What was remarkable about her, the offspring of two large, baggy parents, was her clear-cut, almost exquisite finish\u2026 Yes, she could look after herself. She was far from ordinary\u2019.\u2018Straightforward\u2019 Whipple\u2019s prose may be, but one is drawn in immediately. Some of the turns of phrase which she crafts are beautiful: \u2018Wisteria toppled over a high garden wall in dusty mauve cascades\u2019. Someone at a Distance is, quite honestly, a stunning novel, and one of the best books which I have read in a long while. As an author, Whipple has an incredible amount to offer; her books provide a marvellously restful solace in our hectic world."}, {"userName": "Amanda Brookfield", "userReviewDate": "Mar 14, 2014", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/25327464-amanda-brookfield", "userReview": "This is a wonderful book - intelligent, at times very funny, but also deeply poignant. It tells the story of a marriage that is gradually destroyed thanks to the arrival of a 'viper' into its happy nest. What touched me most was the deft and gentle revelation of how deeply fragile even the most secure human relationships are, built as they are on that invisible cornerstone we call trust.Dorothy Whipple was extremely successful for a period in her own writing life - the 1930s and 1940s - but fell out of fashion (a terrifying concept for all authors!) because, as her agent put it, 'Editors have gone mad about action and passion instead.' In my view 'Someone At A Distance' abounds with both action and passion. The everyday joys and suffering of her characters are utterly credible, so painfully so, that by the end I was rooting for them to find a way out of the mess. (And no, I am not going to say whether they manage it or not).In my experience it is rare to find an author who can offer such depth and substance with so light a touch. The skill in achieving this is considerable and yet the reader is so swept along by the story that it feels effortless. So add this, or indeed any Dorothy Whipple novel, to your must-read lists.

Their plain grey covers and their shape and size give them a distinctive air. However, until now, I had never taken the plunge and borrowed or bought one. But the informal book group that I belong to reached a consensus recently that we should read 'Someone at a Distance' by Dorothy Whipple. I am so pleased that we did (and I am very grateful to the friend who suggested the book). It's a wonderful story. I suspect that Dorothy Whipple, who wrote several other novels (also published by Persephone), will turn out to be a joyously unexpected discovery for many readers. First published in 1953, 'Someone at a Distance' is a 400-page novel. Set primarily in London and its suburbs (with interludes in a small French town), it's essentially the story of a man's mid-life crisis. Wealthy, middle class publisher Avery North has an affair with Louise, a young French woman who has come into contact with the North family as a paid companion to Avery's widowed mother. The latter half of the story depicts the impact of Avery's infidelity on his wife, Ellen, his two children, Hugh and Anne, and his friend and publishing partner, John Bennett. The first half of the story recounts Louise's relationship with her parents, her impact on Avery's mother and the build-up to the affair itself. It would spoil things if I said any more than that about the plot. The story, then, is hardly original. But Whipple's writing makes up for that. It is beautifully poised, her characterisation is superb and her psychological insight is spot on. As a result, a novel that could so easily have been run-of-the-mill is an exceptional one that will live long in the memory. 'Someone at a Distance' is a tale about the fragility of our emotional lives and how easily and rapidly apparent happiness can turn on its head. It's an examination of a marriage that is deeply flawed despite superficial appearances to the contrary. It reminds me a great deal of another superb novel that deals with much the same issue and which was published at around the same time: 'The Tortoise and the Hare' by Elizabeth Jenkins. 'Someone at a Distance' is a well-constructed, beautifully-paced story. Several of the characters are unlikeable - in particular the cold, calculating Louise; the somewhat weak and emotionally insipid Avery; and Avery's cantankerous and demanding mother. But they are all portrayed vividly and are very believable. Whipple's prose is just the sort that I like. She writes in a style that is simple and unfussy and which has you turning the pages rapidly, eager to know what happens next. Bravo to Persephone Books for rescuing such a great novel from neglect and obscurity. They have an extensive list of current publications. I think I'll explore it further. I certainly intend to try some of Dorothy Whipple's other work.

This imprint appears to be ploughing a similar furrow to many of the original Virago Modern Classics: rescuing from obscurity interesting and well-written novels by or about women that have been unjustly forgotten. This novel fits into that category well, describing as it does an at first idyllically happy marriage and home in 1950s England. Unfortunately, neither Ellen North, the novel's heroine, nor her foolish husband Avery, are a match for the scheming Louise, a young French woman who comes to England as a companion to Avery's mother after a romantic disappointment. After Louise is left a substantial legacy following the mother's death she comes to stay with the Norths, and resolves to stay until she has her hands on the money. Both envious and scornful of Ellen she begins to flirt with Avery...First published in 1953, it would probably be very difficult for this novel to find a publisher today. It was probably a little old-fashioned even in 1953, and its scrupulous avoidance of sex-scenes would be the despair of a modern editor. All the characters are well-drawn. Only Ellen's naivety prevents her being thoroughly admirable, and Louise is a superb villain, and there are several interesting secondary characters.

Old Mrs. North, the widow of a highly successful industrialist, brings 27-year-old \"French girl\" Louise Lanier, into her home for companionship and light domestic duties. Louise, seething with resentment at being thrown over by her former lover, rich-boy Paul Devoisy--who has recently made a very bourgeois marriage to a plain and pious town girl with a good dowry--recognizes the new opportunities available to her. After Louise is left a significant amount of money by Mrs. North, she returns to England to collect it, finagling an extended stay at the home of the deceased woman's handsome and happily married middle-aged son, Avery, a partner in a successful London publishing firm. Motivated by her rage at Paul, Louise seduces Avery, whose family life is destroyed. The novel is an account of the ruination of a marriage by infidelity, but also an investigation into a female sociopathic mind. There is considerable melodrama, yes, and some moralizing, but the writing is generally smart and the characterization--with the exception of the limp and rather weak-willed Avery--convincing. A page-turner."}, {"userName": "Mary wilhelm", "userReviewDate": "Mar 27, 2009", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/1553619-mary-wilhelm", "userReview": "What was truly insightful about this books was the \"expectation of women\". After WWII in England, many in the upper classes found it difficult to find domestic help. Many of the jobs that were once live-in were almost impossible to find. That meant that many of these wealthy women would have to take care of a huge house by herself. The way in which Dorothy Whipple describes this is extremely sympathetic. And of course the men would NEVER help out. The series of events is devastating - really. There is a certain amount of discomfort when you are reading it as well. But Whipple's writing is so beautiful that you know in the end the protagonist will overcome these horrific events. The protagonist is at times too self-less - as liberated women of the 21st century you want to smack her on the head. But Whipple does explain that there were things you could not do. The protagonist becomes stubborn when it comes to financial help and at first you become infuriated with her, but then you begin to understand and admire her. I think this book should be read by anyone who has any interest in women's issues."}, {"userName": "Dileri", "userReviewDate": "Jun 18, 2012", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/1063268-dileri", "userReview": "This was really a 3.5 star book for me, but I liked it overall. Well-written, carefully observed, and generally an engrossing story. I did have serious misgivings about the ending, though, which is possibly why I didn't rate it higher. I felt that after the journey the characters take in the book, I didn't want it to go there. It did masterfully paint a picture of what happens to Ellen, the main character, as the world as she knows it comes crashing down around her. Just as enjoyable was seeing how she starts to put things back together in the harrowing months after her marriage crumbles. The \"other woman\" is deliciously evil, but written with enough depth that she doesn't come off as cartoonish."}, {"userName": "Claude", "userReviewDate": "May 08, 2015", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/4490527-claude", "userReview": "Another great book by Dorothy Whipple.

This might be due to a somewhat slower reading process than usual, or perhaps due to the book's slow unfolding plot. I do, however, completely understand why this poignant novel on a happy marriage suddenly falling apart has been put in the Persephone Classics category.It is typical Louise, the self-absorbed French girl who tears apart the fabric of domesticity, would have Madame Bovary as her favourite novel (see also my review of Madame Bovary and my scathing opinion on Emma Bovary). She is thoroughly unsympathetic, bitter, hateful and utterly uncaring about anything or anyone except herself. It is, therefore, still somewhat uncomprehesible to me that Avery would give in to her avances and commit adultery with a girl he so clearly dislikes. Pure carnal desire? Maybe.Avery is a good man, it is repeatedly claimed. Yet this good man does not see his wife tirelessly working at home to make everyone comfortable, missing quite some fun because she is always organising and arranging things behind the scenes. It never occurs to him to help her, that's for certain. Still, he loves his children and is the perfect dad - until he deserts them, that is. Avery's pride is essentially what keeps him from returning, not wanting to \"eat the humble pie\". This leads to a drinking problem causes by a deep unhappiness, and of course his wife's predicament. Interesting to see how pride, stubbornness and desperation all come together so fatally.Then there is Ellen, the dutiful wife, the housewife, the mother, the one taking care of her family in every possible way except financially. I felt a deep, deep regret for Ellen - first, she spends all her time and energy in the service of her husband and children, then he runs off with a pretty yet unpleasant girl, leaving Ellen to pick up the pieces and attempt to placate the children. Ellen is a saint, sometimes, too good to be true in her kindness and never ending support, which is also what makes her a somewhat boring character until she has to fend for herself.Someone at a Distance dissects the dynamics of a happy marriage in the middle of the 20th century and shows how one person's selfinterestedness can overthrow all this."}, {"userName": "Jessica", "userReviewDate": "Jan 17, 2011", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/3064329-jessica", "userReview": "In my plan to eventually read all the Persephone books in order, Someone at a Distance is number three. I was kind of dreading it because it is a book about a woman who gets left by her husband for another woman. In other words, a real downer. It's a testament to Dorothy Whipple's eminently readable writing style and her deft use of the omniscient narrator that I had difficulty putting this book down despite its gloomy subject matter.Whipple has a gift for creating character psychologies. And it's not just the protagonist whose inner workings we are privy to, but every character in the story, down to the family cat.The most fascinating character is the other woman, Louise. She is so very close to being downright evil and could be easily dismissed as such if I didn't wince at her every selfish act and recognize a part of myself in it. In that regard, it was a rather disturbing book for me. Ironically, I found the story of Ellen, the happy, loving wife and mother who is left, seemingly on a whim, by her longtime husband, to be ultimately reassurring. I won't say any more except that Someone at a Distance reminds us that the winners in life are not always who you think they are."}, {"userName": "Elena Sala", "userReviewDate": "Dec 18, 2016", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/58119141-elena-sala", "userReview": "This is the story of the destruction of a happy marriage, a deceptively simple plot which, nevertheless, offers entertainment as well as social commentary. The novel is set in post war rural England and tells the tale of a naive, good woman and her foolish, proud husband. The family is torn apart by a flirtatious, vain young French woman who, very aptly, identifies herself with Emma Bovary. While it is true that the couple derived their unity from their two children, especially the young daughter, it is also true that no one saw the serpent coming until it was too late. Both, husband and wife, were unwillingly responsible for their domestic drama.The ending is a bit too neat, in my opinion, but I believe the novel offers a brilliant examination of human frailty, happiness and family life. It is a very well written novel, a compelling read with lots of emotional tension."}, {"userName": "Dianna", "userReviewDate": "Mar 12, 2010", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/1859681-dianna", "userReview": "I love domestic novels about family life and housekeeping and happiness and the first half of this novel was right up my alley. The second half veered off into more depressing territory: adultery and its consequences. I hate it when happy books go all wrong like that, but it was still a good, beautifully written book, and I'm glad I've read it and had my horizons expanded. Dorothy Whipple describes Ellen's pain in such detail I almost felt as if I were there. Although I haven't gone through infidelity or divorce myself, I have friends who have and although this isn't obviously isn't the same as their stories, I feel that it will help me relate and sympathize better."}, {"userName": "Evelyn Foss", "userReviewDate": "Sep 07, 2015", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/1889531-evelyn-foss", "userReview": "I didn't want this book to end. I had the good fortune to visit the Persephone Book Store this past August and picked this book to bring home with me, so it has been savored and mixed with trip after-glow. If you are in London, drop by Persephone- it's a lovely place set in a quiet spot on Lamb's Conduit Street.I wish my mother was still alive because this is the sort of book she would have enjoyed and we would have discussed the characters. I loved Ellen's grit and ability to make the best of her situation. She is a hero that can still be admired in the twenty first century."}], "description": "'A very good novel indeed about the fragility and also the tenacity of love' commented the Spectator recently about this 1953 novel by Dorothy Whipple, which was ignored fifty years ago because 'editors are going mad for action and passion' (as she was told by her publisher). Apparently 'a fairly ordinary tale about the destruction of a happy marriage' (Nina Bawden) yet 'it makes compulsive reading' in its description of an ordinary family struck by disaster when the husband, in a moment of weak, mid-life vanity, runs off with a French girl.
