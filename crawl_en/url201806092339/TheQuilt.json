I've read several T. Davis Bunn books. My Mom participates in a Prayer Shawl ministry. The ladies knit a shawl for a shut-in and while they knit they pray for that person. Well, this book's storyline is similar except the ladies in the book are helping a very elderly lady, Mary, make a quilt. Mary teaches the ladies the importance of prayer especially the giving of thanks. The following story is told by Mary after one of the ladies find a poem written on a sheet of paper stuck in one of Mary's old Bibles (George Matheson was the author of the poem):\"George Matheson was a man of the Lord, born and raised in Scotland. I forgot when he lived, but I know it wasn't in this century. He fell in love with a beautiful young lady, and they planned to marry. Not long before his wedding day, George Matheson discovered he was going blind.\" Mary waited until the room quietened, then continued, \"He did what he had to do, went to his young lady and told her the news. Told her she could break off the engagement if she wanted, but that he still loved her and wanted to marry if she would have him. The woman thought about it for several days, then came back and said that though she loved him, she did not want to spend the rest of her life with a blind man. And the wedding was off. Soon after this, George Matheson wrote a hymn.\" Mary turned back from the window. She lifted the brittle page with trembling hands, looked at it for a long moment, then handed it over to Lou Ann. Her voice was as shaky as her hands when she said, \"Read that first verse for me, honey, my eyes aren't what they used to be.\"Lou Ann studied the ancient script, read in a halting voice.O Love that wilt not let me go,I rest my weary soul in Thee;I give Thee back the life I owe,That in Thine ocean depths its flowMay richer, fuller be.\"The Lord holds me always in His love, Dr Caswell [this was her preacher who had given her this poem/hymn shortly after her baby had died) told me,\" Mary said to the silent room.\" Always there, always loving, always giving, always healing. At my weakest, the Lord is strongest.\"Mary paused a moment, kneading one hand with the other, then said, \"George Matheson went blind, and he didn't marry the girl. He lived a full life for his Lord, and toward the end of his time on earth he wrote a prayer. I think more than anything these words were what saw me through my own dark times.\" She looked at Lou Ann, said, \"Just read that section there at the bottom that starts, 'My God,' please child.\"Lou Ann cleared her throat, wiped her eyes, read,My God,I have never thanked thee for my thorn.I have thanked thee a thousand times for my roses,But never once for my thorn.Teach me the glory of my cross,Teach me the value of my thorn.Show me that I have climbed to thee by the path of my pain.Show me that my tears have made my rainbows.\"There's lessons right along to the end of the road,\" Mary said, her eyes back on the window. She sighed, shook her head, said softly to the world outside, \"What strength that man must have had.\"If you enjoyed this story you will enjoy the book!"}, {"userName": "Brigette", "userReviewDate": "Nov 30, 2015", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/6152862-brigette", "userReview": "A sweet little book."}, {"userName": "Mary Partridge", "userReviewDate": "Aug 30, 2014", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/5865524-mary-partridge", "userReview": "This is one of the most wonderful books I have ever read. While we are all so caught up in our lives and worries that those of us who do pray are most always prayers of requesting things, asking for forgiveness. This little gem of a book teaches one simple lesson, to remember to say prayers of Thanksgiving, not only for the good things in our lives, but also the bad, unhappy things.It is in the suffering of the bad things that we are made stronger. It is so easy to celebrate the good things in life, but to not only accept the bad things, but to be thankful for them, for the strength they have given us and the lessons that they have taught us is truly a lesson well learned and a life well-lived.

They represent so many skills, so many memories, so many stories to be told. . .\"\"And yet in the twilight of her days, Mary felt a gentle yearning in her heart, the whisper of a melody she strained to hear . . . There was something left undone.\"And so reads the back cover of this charming story of Mary, a widow, mother, grandmother and friend to many. Mary could be the mother or grandmother of any of us. But Mary's story is special. The \"something left undone\" even more so.T. Davis Bunn writes lyrical prose as he unfolds this story of not only family but community as Mary brings together the women in her life, her community, her church, and even her sons, all of whom must come to accept Mary's burning desire: To make one last quilt.What no one understands is that hidden in Mary's wish to make one more quilt is what else Mary asks of them. Mary's need to make this quilt goes deeper than the quilt frame that her son assembles, the backing and the batting gathered up, the pieces stitched together, and the tiny quilting stitches for the finishing touch.T. Davis Bunn weaves the threads of the story of this elderly grandmother and her wish to make \"one more quilt\" in such a way that the reader feels as if he or she is sitting with Mary and these women deep and earnest concentration while assisting in the quilt making that goes on in Mary's front room.Bunn is magical in telling this story. He never once loses the path he has chosen to follow in his theme, and the story is woven with each tiny stitch of the quilt into a masterpiece. The result of the book, and the quilt, is that it changes the not only everyone in Mary's world but also the reader.A short book, only 125 pages, The Quilt spreads a powerful message for all to consider."}, {"userName": "Loraine", "userReviewDate": "Sep 02, 2013", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/1922494-loraine", "userReview": "SUMMARY: A Truly Beautiful Story That Transcends Time and PlaceThe Quilt is the story of Mary, an elderly grandmother whose gnarled, arthritic hands have a beauty all their own. They represent so many skills, so many memories, so many stories to be told. Anyone who had met Mary described her as beautiful--she had always been there to listen and comfort and encourage those who were in pain, those who had lost their way. And yet in the twilight of her days, Mary felt a gentle yearning in her heart, the whisper of a melody she strained to hear.... There was something left undone.When Mary becomes convinced that the task still unfinished is to make one more very special quilt, with every stitch sewn in prayer and thankfulness, the impact on her family and the surrounding community cannot be contained. No one who gets involved with this quilting project will ever be quite the same again!REVIEW: This was a story that truly touched my heart. An easy-to-read, one sitting novella that is a lesson in gratitude. The main character, Mary, is an elderly lady and she teaches those around her to be thankful at all times. This simple story is full of tiny gems of writing that will stay in your mind for a long time. I have read many books by Davis Bunn, most of them historical. This is a totally different type of writing from him and it was excellent.FAVORITE QUOTES: Really too many to list but here are a few:\"The Lord holds me always in His love...Always there, always loveing, always giving, always healing. At my weakest, the Lord is strongest.\"\"And I saw how all the things that I worried about were shadows that kept me from seeing what I really needed to do, which was be thankful.\"\"Son, let me tell you a little secret I've learned in these long years of mine. Tomorrow never comes. You either have it today, or you don't.\""}, {"userName": "Nora St Laurent", "userReviewDate": "Jul 13, 2015", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/1100689-nora-st-laurent", "userReview": "This the story of Mary, an elderly grandmother whose gnarled, arthritic hands have a beauty all their own.

This book has a sweet, calm tone that is very relaxing, which was very welcome during the busy holidays. Here's the quilt's description: \"The quilt was a picture and a story. It was a testimony to a time when pressures did not cry out for urgent things to be constantly tended to, when the world had not created a thousand different temptations pulling free time into a myriad of mindless activities.... It drew the person in. It spoke of comfort and rest. It soothed with the gentleness of a mother's kiss.\" I hope to someday create something that evokes a message like that!And the simple, important message: to be thankful! I especially liked one of the scriptures quoted in the book. It is Philippians 4:4-7 -- \"Rejoice in the Lord always...The Lord is near. Do not be anxious about anything, but in everything, by prayer and petition, with thanksgiving, present your requests to God.
