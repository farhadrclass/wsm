You all know how it is. You start off tidying up but then you find something you forgot you had like a Katie Morag book or a recorder and you spend like a half an hour just fucking around with it and by the time you get back down to business, you can't be bothered cleaning any more and it all gets kicked right back under the bed because fuck it - no one's going to look under there. Who cares if it's tidy or not?So I was cleaning up and I found this chocolate Santa still in his foil clothing. I sniffed it to see if it was foosty because let's face it, he'd been languishing in that box all year. But he smelled alright, so I held on to him and started to look through the other stuff.I kind of needed my hands then, so as I was standing over the box, I tucked him between my knees just to avoid placing him on the floor (because it's covered in dog hair). I pressed him too hard and crushed one of his arms. So to the ER/kitchen I rushed him, for repair. When I got there, I realized it was too late and decided just to eat him instead of faffing around with the tin foil.So I start to peel off the foil - and what the fuck did I find? I found out that underneath his nice, shiny PC clothing, he was in fact a chocolate Pope.A chocolate POPE.Pope's hat, robes, all the bells and whistles. I'm not fucking kidding you. He was a POPE. I screamed and stamped my feet on the floor. Consumerist brainwashing, I declared! Santa is a neutral entity accessible to all, like Switzerland or Dairy Queen! The Pope is not!I was going to eat him just to spite all that, but he didn't taste good. He tasted a year old.He tasted like deceit.You're probably wondering what the hell this has to do with Legend. Well, I'll tell you!This book is the EXACT OPPOSITE of a chocolate Pope.This book was like buying a foil Pope, and then opening it up to find a chocolate Santa. Who isn't a Santa at all, but just a casing in which three tickets to Rome are hidden along with a fat lump of gold and an Indigo gift card!I wasn't expecting much from this book. I won't lie. I've read my fair share of shitty YA dystopians. In fact, I've given up on my fair share of shitty YA dystopias. But this! This book made the little crying feminist inside me sob with joy while the little crying writer inside me burned with jealousy that someone else could write something so fabulous!I can't really be bothered to keep on typing, but I'll tell you this: you cannot go wrong here. This book has so many logic farts, but they don't even MATTER. The characters are absolutely incredible, the plot is a freaking rollercoaster ride of excitement and doom, and the writing!Oh, the writing!Marie Lu, you are fucking amazing. Maybe it's just personal preference, but the writing in Legend is just perfect. It's straight-talking, no fluffy crap but just enough emotion to make me care. And it's present tense! Hurrah, old chaps!Yeah, a shit ton of people really hate present tense, but I love it. Past tense is decent, nothing really wrong with it, but it's more poetic; doesn't have the same immediacy required for a fast-paced action-punch novel like this one. Which is to say: past and present tense each have their respective places. And this book got it right.Ugh! This book! It's just wonderful. Oh, so wonderful. And it made my post-New Year weekus horribilis a hell of a lot better. Ku-dos.Edit: I've read a lot of reviews for this book, and I'm struck by something. Am I the only person who noticed the Tiananmen Square reference in this book? I was waiting to see if anybody else would comment on it, but nobody has. Is it just that nobody noticed it, or does nobody know what I'm talking about?BONUS TIME!Back by popular demand!This BT really has nothing to do with anything, but it's too awesome not to share.

I love the energy, the rush I get from them. When I got my copy of Legend I was thrilled. Now I know I had a good reason to be. This is one of the good ones. A dystopian well worth reading!We've got two narrators: the notorious criminal, Day, and the noble citizen, though a little rebellious, June. Day has escaped death before, and he's only trying to survive while taking care of his family, especially his sick brother. June got a perfect score on her Trial and she's trying to get revenge for her brother's death. Their paths cross and the story takes hold in the most unprecedented way. I truly enjoyed both of these narrators equally - which rarely happens. They both have great characteristics that make each POV really interesting and addicting. I couldn't wait to find out how their situations would play out. It was brilliant. We go through the story on both sides, night and day, and we're persuaded to root for each of them the all the same. It was original and well thought out.The plot was typical dystopian; the world is completely changed and a new government has taken over, and they may or may not have everyone's best interest at heart *cough*. The reason for the present peril and what happened to the world wasn't explained as much as I would have liked. I hope the next installments discloses more details. We did get enough to still make sense of it and enjoy the story, though. It was fast paced, which is always welcome in this type of book. There were no slow or boring parts, and it also didn't go in the direction I imagined it would. Which is great because it took me off guard and kept me really glued to the story. This is another one not to miss, folks!

What just happened?!? This book is ABSOLUTELY UNPUTDOWNABLE!! Yes, I realize that\u2019s not a word, but I have to admit I\u2019m a bit sleep deprived seeing as I stayed up all night reading this FRICKEN AMAZING book!! Okay let me just tell you now, this review is going to be an absolute, incoherent gush-fest. I haven\u2019t felt this pumped about a YA dystopic novel since the The Hunger Games came to town. Mind you, I\u2019ve read some pretty awesome stories since, such as Divergent, Blood Red Road, and Burn Bright. But when I\u2019m taking this book with me to run errands so I can read in between red lights, I know something fantastical is going on, and there\u2019s no way in HALE I\u2019m stopping! GIVE.ME.MORE.NOW.P.L.E.A.S.E!\tMarie Lu has created a book where the voices are powerful, the narrative is commanding, and the plot is explosive\u2026 all the way to the absolute end. Legend has shot up to my top spot in highly addictive series. This book was nothing short of riveting making it worthy of applause, standing ovations and literary accolades. I\u2019m giving it everything I\u2019ve got! I anticipate this novel getting some well deserved buzz, and I can\u2019t wait to see how it all plays out. E.X.C.I.T.E.M.E.N.T.!~okay breathe~With Lu\u2019s debut novel, she\u2019s created this moment in time, over 100 years into the future, where the United States has split between the Colonies and the Republic and natural disasters have drastically changed the landscape of California and its surrounding states. Plagues are diminishing the population; and two sides of what was once one country are fighting each other using biological warfare, lies and anything and everything in their arsenal for land and power. This story is told in alternating POVs between Day (Daniel Altan Wing) who is a criminal on the run from the Republic authorities, and June Iparis a recent graduate of the Republic academy who is placed on a mission to hunt down Day. When these two characters collide, secrets and conspiracies force them to take a closer look around them to find their true enemy and an all out manhunt explodes.Being from Southern California, it was interesting to experience the setting of the book from an insider\u2019s perspective. I\u2019m very much familiar with Los Angeles and our beloved Public Library. So, to read how the state has changed was pretty captivating. The characters in this book, including Day, June, Tess and Kaede are definitely qualified to pull this series through to the end and I\u2019m curious how the relationships between these four will play out. Lastly, I\u2019ll admit now, that the downfall to reading advanced reader copies well before the release date is that we have to wait even longer for the next installment, but with incredible books such as Legend\u2026 it\u2019s worth the wait. Congrats to Marie Lu for exploding the YA writing scene with a story that\u2019s finally, FINALLY going to give The Hunger Games fans what they\u2019ve been craving. Something amazing!Huge thanks to Flannery from thereadventurer for letting me read her ARC. ~tackle hug~ Thank you!"}, {"userName": "Wendy Darling", "userReviewDate": "Jun 24, 2011", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/2745288-wendy-darling", "userReview": "I like an action-packed adventure, don't you? Legend is a lot of fun to read, and follows two teens who are born into opposite sides of a war in a futuristic Los Angeles in the Republic of America. 15-year-old June is an exceptionally gifted prodigy who is being groomed to become a military star. But when her brother is senselessly murdered, she embarks upon a mission to find his killer--and discovers that all signs point towards Day, a notorious criminal who is already wanted by the Republic.This is a cocktail of utopian YA, Romeo and Juliet, and various wronged imprisonment stories all blended together with liberal dashes of adventure and intrigue. I liked both June and Day, and I was eager to learn more about the big mystery behind why the government is so interested in Day's brother. The best thing about Legend, however, is the terrific action sequences that the author writes into the story: there are great chases, exciting escape scenes, girl on girl sparring, and lots more. As with so many of these books that are stretched out to accommodate sequels, there really aren't enough answers unearthed in this first installment, so presumably we'll have to wait until book two to find out the details of government's involvement in biological experimentation. What prevents this from being a truly excellent book, however, is that the book overall feels very slight. At 300 pages, it is surprisingly short and there isn't a great deal of complexity in the characters, the world-building, or the plot. It's also extremely predictable. While the story is certainly well-written, most readers will be able to anticipate pretty much every plot development and thought that crosses the characters' minds...and really, what's the fun in that?Still, I liked this book and I think it's among the better dystopian YA books that have been released lately. It's definitely an entertaining read and I'm interested in seeing where the story goes next. I do wish, however, that it contained more depth and more originality and more...everything, really, in order to make it a truly outstanding and truly memorable book.This review also appears in The Midnight Garden."}, {"userName": "Etnik", "userReviewDate": "Aug 27, 2014", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/34369915-etnik", "userReview": "____________________________________________\n\n\u201cEach day means a new twenty-four hours.

He doesn't blush, and his eyes don't dart away. Instead I find myself staring into a pair of oceans - one perfect, the other blemished by that tiny ripple. \"You're very attractive.\"I've been complimented on my appearance before. But never in his tone of voice. Of all the things he's said, I don't know why this catches me off guard.

You live in the moment, you die in the moment, you take it all one day at a time.\u201d\nSo I finally decided to pick this up after sifting through all the reviews and reading positive after negative after positive after negative, sometimes I guess you just have to see for yourself. And Legend was all right, pretty good when compared to some of the crap I've read recently, it just wasn't anything particularly spectacular either. That being said, I'm still probably going to read the sequel because I seem to have come down with that annoying disease known as \"caringaboutthecharactersitis\".In my opinion, this book was significantly better than Delirium, Matched, Shatter Me, Dark Inside, Pure and Article 5. It stood out amongst other members of the overcrowded dystopian genre, but that was mostly because a lot of the others are so atrociously bad, rather than this being overly mind-blowing. It was fun, though, easy to read, quite entertaining, I don't have any regrets about reading it.The main characters are far less annoying than some I've had the displeasure of encountering in this genre. They're not that original or inspiring but they're the kind of carbon copies I don't mind seeing so much. She is self-reliant and can kick ass without the sexy love interest's assistance. He's kind, considerate and brave. The chemistry between them never seems forced, despite it being yet another \"they felt drawn to one another\" scenario. Somehow it doesn't matter that much here.The world building is the weakest part of the novel, something that seems to apply to most new releases in the dystopian genre. A fact which is strange when surely the whole point of a \"dystopia\" is the world the characters interact in. But whatever, I will begin to sound like a broken record. It does get better towards the end of Legend with clues being introduced about the time before the Republic existed. This gives me hope that Marie Lu is simply withholding her world building to prolong the reader's interest, but I just hope that I'm not left hanging on this matter at the end of the second book too.Another thing I didn't like - because I couldn't believe in it - was all the huge leaping to conveniently accurate conclusions. The protagonists would look at an unbelievably small piece of evidence and manage to solve an entire mystery out of it. I wasn't convinced, I don't care how smart you are, you would not have gone from A to B like that. You just wouldn't.Though this isn't going to make it onto any of my \"favourites\" lists, I'd recommend this book to a lot of people. Those who keep loving trashy dystopias with a forbidden romance story, those who liked any of those books I listed in the second paragraph. Those who look for light entertainment rather than deep meaning or fantastic writing in their books. I conclude that Legend is not that bad, it'll probably be a hit with anyone who isn't getting tired of reading poorly constructed dystopia after poorly constructed dystopia.UPDATE 09/2014: This review is not very positive, but the books get better and better!Blog | Leafmarks | Facebook | Twitter | Instagram | Tumblr"}, {"userName": "Rachel E.

I pretty much feel the same way I did back in 2015. I enjoyed the book and the characters. I love Day so much and I love Tess and June. I love that even though Day and June were enemies at first because of what June thought happened to her brother, they came together and found out the truth. It seems like there are some jerks running around lying. BUT, they always are right? The Republic and The Colonies are at war, they are always at war. Can't anyone just get along? And there is a plague that is killing people. Supposedly they are giving people a cure and if you make it you do and if you don't you don't. June and Day find out some revelations behind that too and ewwww. Anyway, I really hope to love the next two books!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!! I better love the next two books because I'm losing the battle of trilogies lately. Damn it! MY BLOG: Melissa Martin's Reading List*****Old Review From 2015*****I can't believe I waited this long to read this book! I didn't think I would like it but I was so wrong. I loved it! The characters of June, Day and Tess were awesome! I'm going to try to write this without any spoilers! So, there are the rich people and the poor people and there is a plague going around, but it seems to only be in the poor parts of town. Go figure right? Day is a sort of Robin Hood, steal from the rich and give to the poor. He's awesome and I love him! He took Tess on as a sort of sister when he found her some time ago all alone on the streets. He's a really good guy. When he finds out his families house is marked for the plague he feels he has to break into the hospital and steal the cure. They only let the rich people in, the jerks. He is almost caught and in his escape he injures a soldier named Metia in the shoulder. This turns out to be the brother of June, who is automatically brought in as a soldier of sorts to hunt down and bring Day to justice. They end up meeting in a weird way and when she finds out he is Day, she has him caught. So, all of these things happen that are not what they seem forcing Day and June to come together as a team. This does not bother them at all as they have fallen for each other. It is a very good storyline with some messed up people doing some messed up things, but isn't that always the cause with people in government :) I look forward to the rest of the trilogy!"}, {"userName": "Kate \u2661", "userReviewDate": "Feb 21, 2014", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/15154637-kate", "userReview": "Legend by Marie LuHolyyyyy, omg, where do i start..This book was absolutely incredible!From the time i read the first page, i knew it was going to be great, but never as amazing as it truly was.

Yes.Do I want to see an Asian getting a head start with her first novel? Yes.Do I want to see *finally* there's a well written dystopian novel gracing the realm of YA? Yes.Still I can't pretend Legend is a good book, I just can't. The following gif shows my feeling toward this book:Okay, I can handle teenagers being stupid and clueless about how the world works, but I can't handle 15 years old teenagers who are supposed to be geniuses to act like a pair of hopeless idiots for an entire book.I am not a huge fan of dystopian novels but I especially dislike authors coming up with dystopian worlds which make no sense at all with governments doing evil things and killing off children for no good reason other than to show off how evil and fucked up said government is. After finished reading the whole story, I read from the Acknowledgement at the back of the book that the author, Marie Lu started writing the story of Legend when she was 14 years old. Ah, now I can understand why as a whole this book feels so very damn juvenile even for a Young Adult novel. I am so done with all this eye-rolling stupidity, I am not going to read any more book by Marie Lu.Should I make a list to note down all the problems we have to face when encountering this piece of works?(1)The main characters:Day: At the ripe old age of 15, this boy has survived alone on the streets for five long years and he is the most wanted criminal in the country.Oh, so in this futuristic America, you become the most wanted criminal not by being a terrorist, a bank robber with firearm, a hacker or a serial killer, but by stealing, pushing pranks at the government and 'making them look bad'.Give me a break.And I don't believe for a second that Day can be a super smart tough kid who had endured the hardship of surviving on the mean streets for five long years, his actions and choices have never showed me enough wit and wisdom for him to survive that long. Plus he never mentions anything about going hungry, having to beg for food and money, being beat up or running into street gang in his past experience, how realistic.June: A 15 years old star student of the military and also the one and only teen in the entire country to get a perfect 1500 score at her Trail when she was 10 years old. Not only June is supposed to be super smart, she also has as much emotion as a robot, who can stay perfectly calm and showing barely any grief when she was informed, out of the blue, her older brother is dead and his corpse is on display right in front of her.Okay, it's nice to have a YA heroine who doesn't cry and moan at the slightest of things, but how can a girl act so emotionless at the wake of her brother's death? And she is also cool when seeing a spy gets tortured half to death?Not to mention, these two super smart teenagers fail to see through the villains' wicked plan when I can see it coming from a mile away.(2)The world building:What world building? I only know the country is at war with another enemy country and every kid has to go through a Trail when they reach 10 years old and those who fail the Trail would be (secretly) sentenced to death; plus the existence of the good-old United States is hidden by the evil government, it's mentioned that there were a series of natural disasters in the past, these are more or less all the world building I've ever gotten.Curious why the evil government would waste all those healthy-but-not-smart-enough kids by NOT training them up to be soldiers or labors when said government is at war with another nation, which means they would have needed all the manpower they can get their hands on instead of killing healthy and able 10 years old.Not to mention, in this futuristic world, police can randomly beat children up for disobedience and they can take money and food from the poor people; but why would the citizens allow it? How does the government justify such things? How does said government remain in power when they are treating the poor people like dirt? Nothing is explained.(3) The messed up little details:Ah yes, in this futuristic world, they can't afford to put CCTVs around hospitals and police stations, but somehow they manage to have the freaking Internet.The point is, when Day breaks into a hospital, there is no CCTV to record his break-in, but by the end of the story, all of a sudden there are CCTVs around for the bad guys to check upon? Why are CCTVs suddenly there? Just because the author said so?Not only that, after the soldiers shot an plague-infected woman, they never bother to pick up the body, they just leave the corpse by the doorstep, and no one cares about an infected corpse being left out in the open neither.Are these people for real? Are they Too Stupid To Live or something? I am shocked that none of them has ever thought about burning the infected woman's body, or even burning the entire house down!(4) Tell, not show and lazy writing:We are told Day and June are smart but their actions and choices have always showed me otherwise, we are told Day is supposed to be a cult hero among the poor citizens but the author never bothers to show me any affection toward Day from any of the citizen I had encountered in the book, no one seems to adore Day aside from Tess and Day's own family. I am told there's a war going on but I see no evidence of how the war may affect the daily life of the general public. I feel like the author is taking us all for fools.To me, Legend is one of the perfect examples of why authors should not be allowed to publish a dystopian novel before they pass some tests on science, sociology, psychology and history.Review for book 2:https://www.goodreads.com/review/show..."}, {"userName": "Ariana", "userReviewDate": "May 31, 2011", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/3564852-ariana", "userReview": "I am always afraid to read a book when I\u2019ve been holding my breath for it to come out. Legend is one of those.I had high hopes and I am glad to say that my expectations have been met.I was really eager to meet Day.I\u2019ve heard a lot of good things about him and I was pretty much intrigued, for lack of a better word.Even though in the last half of the book he was more or less absent, I got to care more for him and to understand him better (compared to June).He was an interesting character \u2013 he was smart; he had some great physical abilities that kept him alive in the past 5 years; he had a great family he cared about and his love for them was heartbreaking, his desperation so strong.He was the victim of so many turnarounds and I felt a need so raw to protect him, I wanted to take his pain away, feeling a deep sympathy and sorrow for him.Also, I liked his friendship with Tess and how he cared about her, how they needed and helped each other.At the opposite side there is June \u2013 as it seemed that she had it all too easily \u2013 she was the Republic\u2019s favorite, her brother\u2019s little angel; she thought she could catch Day and she did it in a too easy way. Also her tragedy belonged mostly to the past. I felt like I didn\u2019t witness any of her tragedies and compassion never came.She lost her parents but I didn\u2019t see a strong connection between them so I didn\u2019t feel her pain.She lost her brother (and I felt sorry about it because I really liked Metias, as little as I got to know him. I knew he was suppose to die but still I hoped for this to change somehow through the story) but it was all so quick, again I didn\u2019t feel her pain.What I liked about her is that she kept true to her beliefs until the moment she had some good reasons to not trust any longer the world she was living in. She had her priorities straight \u2013 she wanted to catch her brother\u2019s killer and she never let her feelings change what she knew she had to do.More than that I appreciated her devotion \u2013 when she has something in her mind there was nothing in this world that could stop her. She always has a plan and, no matter what, she finds a way to achieve it.What I liked about this book is the action and turnarounds. I liked how I thought I had it all figured out one moment and then something went terribly wrong. It made me hold my breath through the story and I couldn\u2019t put the book down until the very last page.Still, I felt there was something missing.The book is quite short so at the end there was this need for me to find more about the world they lived in. The book didn\u2019t deliver much information regarding the world building mostly because the characters were a bit clueless about everything that was happening around/behind them. This might change in the next installment so I am not complaining too much.Also the relation between Day and June felt a bit rushed and underdeveloped. I expected a bit more chemistry. The days spent together were not enough for them to grow some strong feeling for each other (even though June didn\u2019t seem like the usual silly girl falling head over heels in love at first sight and then leaving all behind for those feelings \u2013 June was definitely better than that and I really appreciated it for a change.)Now I can\u2019t wait for the next installment. I want to know more about Day, his past, his brother and his dad, I want to know more about June\u2019s family and the biological weapons. I want to see Day and June together, fighting this world\u2026 What can I say, my expectations are high again!\nThis review can also be found at ReadingAfterMidnight.com - Legend____________________________________________Blog (EN) | Facebook | Twitter | Tumblr | Bloglovin' | Blog (RO)____________________________________________Pre-reading Thoughts:I came across Marie Lu's\u00a0DeviantArt\u00a0page\u00a0and I found this cute illustration: 'The making of Legend'Well, I don't know about you, but I can't wait to see Day (the protagonist) in all those scenes and even more.

Having a familiar taste in her writing, I knew I wouldn't be disappointed. And I wasn't! The only problem is, since this is Marie's first actual novel, I noticed changes made in her writing. But that's a good thing, meaning her writing has improved and I was able to see how. So overall, there really wasn't disappointment. Instead, I tried my best to start this novel and finish it in one sitting but sadly, I didn't since I had to go someplace. But besides that, getting back to reading it, I didn't and couldn't stop. Since the first sentence \"My mother thinks I'm dead.\" I was easily attached to this book. Really. That easily. I found it quite surprising since I wasn't a big fan of Marie's novel, The Young Elites, I thought I wouldn't be thrilled by this one, being the first book for the series. Getting on with the review, the book follows two 15 year-olds and again, I read another book with alternating point of views - Day and June. Let me be honest, I've really never liked alternating povs. I didn't mind the shifting ones in Shiver by Maggie Stiefvater and An Ember in the Ashes by Sabaa Tahir. Maybe because all 3 novels are fast-paced and easy to get intrigued by them. I mean, with all 3, I took my time reading them, being not only attached to them but actually being interested in finding out what would happen next.In Shiver I wanted to find out what would happen if Sam really did turn into a wolf again and what would happen to Grace and their relationship.In An Ember in the Ashes I wanted to find out how Laia would save her brother and how Elias would escape.In Legend I wanted to find out how June would find out the truth about her brother's death and discover everything hidden behind other secrets, and how Day would make and save up money for his little brother's illness.Our main character, June, is a prodigy who got a perfect score of her Trial, only ending up getting a better shot for wealth, education and success with whatever path her life is leading her to. Having a brother who is a soldier for the Republic, only being murdered at a hospital, June promises herself and her brother that she will find this murderer, track him down, and kill him. But as she finds out this murderer is Day, LA's most wanted but not most dangerous criminal, she ends up finding the actual truth behind both, her brother's death and her parents. And as both talk to each other like they've known each other longer than 1 week, they discover the truth behind the Republic and the reason for the plague, the illness spreading around children.Set in a dystopian genre, Legend is definitely a recommendation for fans of action-packed books. By action-packed I mean involving brutality, lies only being discovered towards the end, pretending like nothing is known, kidnapping, street fights, bombs suddenly appearing at a stadium filled with people waiting for a young boy to be executed, sacrifices and some romance added to it.Admittedly, I loved both characters since the beginning. June, she's a young woman that all she wanted was to seek revenge for her brother's death. All she wanted was to find out the truth and who was behind everything. Even carrying so much on and with her, she was someone that did not get on my nerves any time, really, not caring about her decisions. Being honest, she didn't make poor decisions. She made them for a reason: to find out the truth, discover secrets, only leading to the path she had been looking for since her vow.Day, our other protagonist, is actually someone who may sound like he has a cold heart or soul, but in reality, he's someone that is trying to find a cure for his little brother. He's someone who cares for his family and friends, trying to keep his identity away from everyone so he won't be caught, even from his own mother who thinks he is dead. He's actually someone who cries for what he feels inside, for what he sees with his beautiful, blue-ocean and bright eyes, and is someone who never ever kills, even if it means his life.Finding out about more characters, this is where the hate for some come. There were 2 in particulate I really hated and got on my nerves: Commander Jamison and Thomas.The Commander was just a hellbitch that gave less of a shit for June and her brother's death, only making it seem real to only feel bad for the girl. Thomas now, was a betraying ass to both, June and his best friend, Metias. The thing is, the characters here are fifteen years old. That's how old I am. Yes, I am young. Yes, I'm still a small teenage child. So maybe that's why I'm enjoying these books set with teenage point of views while I'm still a teen.There were a lot of things happening in Legend at once, being a fast-paced book with battled in it and betrayals. See, there were times where I was left shocked because of what I just read and found out. There were other times where I would cry because of what was happening, only imagining it happening to me. Other times where I was mad because of the shocking thing that had just happened, wanting to close the book and end it. But I was, like I said, easily attached to the book, only wanting to find out what would happen next. I didn't know who was the bad guy at first. I didn't know who was the real killer. I didn't know the reason for it. I didn't know the reason for the violence. I didn't know the reason for the realizations.Now here I am, questioning myself why hadn't I read this earlier? but that's no surprise. I always ask myself there after reading some mind-blowing debut with a different writing. Not only the alternating point of views, or the yellow-colored words for Day's POV, but for the captivating way of the writing. The way Marie is able to write something only to make you keep your eyes on every page, not letting a word slip and be forgotten. Finishing it up, I told myself I would immediately start Prodigy after. The ending in Legend isn't really a cliffhanger, there's no question in what would happen next and no \"jaw-dropping\" where I'm wondering \"what will happen with June and Day? Instead, the ending actually left us with more of a \"stand alone\" book. Or well, it feels like it. I know it's a trilogy, but the ending ended like if no other book would be written. Maybe before the trilogy actually became a thing, maybe that's the reason for it. Maybe it was supposed to be a stand alone. Obviously I don't know since I haven't been in Lu's fanbase for a long quite and I just read her first novel so I can't say much. With all that being said, Marie did not disappoint with this one and I'm excited to see what Prodigy and Champion have for what's next."}, {"userName": "Ninoska Goris", "userReviewDate": "Nov 24, 2016", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/52598215-ninoska-goris", "userReview": "Espa\u00f1ol - English \"En el espejo parezco la de siempre; por dentro soy una persona completamente distinta.

And romance scenes between 17 or 18 years old wouldn't freak me out as opposed to a 15 year old romance scenes >.<"}, {"userName": "\u039caria Vrisanaki ", "userReviewDate": "Aug 05, 2017", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/33193128-aria-vrisanaki", "userReview": "*4,5*\u0393\u03b9\u03b1\u03c4\u03af \u03b5\u03af\u03bd\u03b1\u03b9 \u03b4\u03c5\u03c3\u03c4\u03bf\u03c0\u03b9\u03ba\u03cc.\u0393\u03b9\u03b1\u03c4\u03af \u03b5\u03af\u03bd\u03b1\u03b9 \u03b1\u03bd\u03b8\u03c1\u03ce\u03c0\u03b9\u03bd\u03bf.\u0393\u03b9\u03b1\u03c4\u03af \u03bc\u03b5 \u03c4\u03c1\u03ac\u03b2\u03b7\u03be\u03b5 \u03b1\u03c0\u03cc \u03c4\u03b7\u03bd \u03b1\u03c1\u03c7\u03ae.\u0393\u03b9\u03b1\u03c4\u03af \u03ae\u03b8\u03b5\u03bb\u03b1 \u03c3\u03c5\u03bd\u03ad\u03c7\u03b5\u03b9\u03b1 \u03bd\u03b1 \u03c0\u03b7\u03b3\u03b1\u03af\u03bd\u03c9 \u03c0\u03b1\u03c1\u03b1\u03ba\u03ac\u03c4\u03c9.\u0393\u03b9\u03b1\u03c4\u03af \u03bc\u03ad\u03c7\u03c1\u03b9 \u03c4\u03b7 \u03bc\u03ad\u03c3\u03b7 \u03b4\u03b5\u03bd \u03bc\u03c0\u03bf\u03c1\u03bf\u03cd\u03c3\u03b1 \u03bd\u03b1 \u03c4\u03bf \u03b1\u03c6\u03ae\u03c3\u03c9 \u03ba\u03ac\u03c4\u03c9.\u0393\u03b9\u03b1\u03c4\u03af \u03bf \u039d\u03c4\u03ad\u03c5 \u03b5\u03af\u03bd\u03b1\u03b9 \u03ad\u03bd\u03b1\u03c2 \u03b1\u03c0\u03cc \u03c4\u03bf\u03c5\u03c2 \u03ba\u03b1\u03bb\u03cd\u03c4\u03b5\u03c1\u03bf\u03c5\u03c2 \u0391\u039d\u03a4\u03a1\u0395\u03a3 (15\u03c7\u03c1\u03bf\u03bd\u03bf\u03c5\u03c2) \u03c0\u03bf\u03c5 \u03ad\u03c7\u03c9 \u03b4\u03b9\u03b1\u03b2\u03ac\u03c3\u03b5\u03b9.\u0393\u03b9\u03b1\u03c4\u03af \u03ad\u03c7\u03c9 \u03c4\u03bf\u03bd \u039c\u03b9\u03c4\u03af\u03b1\u03c2 \u03ba\u03b1\u03b9 \u03c4\u03bf\u03bd \u03a4\u03b6\u03bf\u03bd \u03bc\u03ad\u03c3\u03b1 \u03c3\u03c4\u03b7\u03bd \u03ba\u03b1\u03c1\u03b4\u03b9\u03ac \u03bc\u03bf\u03c5.\u0393\u03b9\u03b1\u03c4\u03af \u03bc\u03b5 \u03ad\u03ba\u03b1\u03bd\u03b5 \u03bd\u03b1 \u03ba\u03bb\u03ac\u03c8\u03c9.\u0393\u03b9\u03b1\u03c4\u03af \u03ba\u03b1\u03b9 \u03c4\u03ce\u03c1\u03b1 \u03ba\u03bb\u03b1\u03af\u03c9."}, {"userName": "Bibi", "userReviewDate": "Aug 20, 2017", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/33411728-bibi", "userReview": "Pardon me for raining on the dystopian parade but I'm 5 chapters in and- already the plot development and progression seem patently obvious.

I'm also guessing the two will fall in love, fight the bad guys aka \"The Republic\", then become the symbolic heads of the resistance.

The world building is OK, the general plot is fine. I think what really drew me in was just how precious the characters are - in particular, Day himself...I've only listened to the audio version of this series so far vs reading the actual books. The narration is great- so I'm not sure how much that is affecting my opinion. That being said (and like I mentioned above...) the characters are definitely what made the series for me. Day and June are so sweet and I loved their chemistry. My biggest complaint though is that they definitely act way older than 15. I'm not sure why Marie Lu didn't just make them 17 or 18- which would be much more believable. Sooo I pretty much just changed their ages in my head and I recommend everyone else do the same. I know they age a big during the series but regardless, that age range just doesn't fit. So all in all, don't go into this expecting some super elaborate world or crazy in depth plot - but it is super fun nonetheless. As long as you find yourself connecting to Day and June- you'll definitely enjoy the series just based on them and their interactions - and get plenty of feels out of it.
