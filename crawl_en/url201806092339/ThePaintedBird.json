What kind of a shitstorm do we have here?  For some reason I thought this was the story of a kid caught up in the Holocaust, i.e. a ghetto and concentration camp story. But it isn\u2019t. It\u2019s the story of 7 year old kid (not named) who is sent to the remote Polish countryside by his parents in an attempt to keep him safe. Fat chance of that. The parents appear to have been a little over-optimistic. The kid avoids the Germans, mostly, but he can\u2019t avoid the Poles. For the next five years he hops from one ghastly peasant village to another, being taken in by a series of grotesque caricatures - psychopaths, sadists, rapists the lot of them. Every Polish peasant immediately takes him for a Gypsy and from then on thinks it\u2019s okay \u2013 almost compulsory - to inflict the maximum torment their tiny Polish peasant brains can imagine. Did I say Polish peasant? Yes, very specifically : this book is a hymn of hate to the Polish peasant. There\u2019s only a handful of Germans in the whole 285 pages and one of those is quite kindly . What this novel is saying in a SCREECHINGLY LOUD voice is that you couldn\u2019t have found a better place for your Holocaust than Poland \u2013 everyone truly madly deeply hated the Jews \u2013 and the Gypsies. They really did. They sat around and gleefully told each other that at last the Jews were getting their comeuppance. Historical note : of the 5.8 to 6 million Jews murdered in the Holocaust, 75% came from either Poland or Russia. 90% of all Polish Jews were murdered. ALL of the six extermination camps (as opposed to concentration camps) were in Poland.Cinematic note : Claude Lanzmann says the same thing as Jerzy in his epic documentary \u201cShoah\u201d.Back to the book. There\u2019s a big problem with it. Actually, there are about ten big problems, but the biggest is credibility. Is all this stuff to be believed? I mean, come on, Jerzy! This phantasmagoria of bestiality, rape, murder, torture, more rape, incest, beating, this unceasing onslaught directed against this small boy? Here\u2019s a few quotes :Without saying a word Garbos used to beat me unexpectedly (p154)I did as I was told but he continued the beatings. (p155)As soon as the priest had left, Garbos took me inside, stripped me and flogged me with a willow switch (p156)Garbos would practice at first casually and then more eagerly new ways of flogging me with a willow cane (p159)\u2026he beat me and kicked me until he was out of breath (p160)I went round in a daze and was beaten for neglecting my work (p160)He thought I was mocking him on purpose and I got an even worse beating (p161)He started to beat me more often (p165)he was beating me harder than usual (p166)Okay, this chapter has more beats per minute than most, but there\u2019s at least one gross outrage inflicted on this kid once every five pages or so, either by adults or by every other kid he encounters. You get the idea that this must have been one aggravating revolting brat of a kid. No one even smiles at him until page 213. You get so you aren\u2019t taking this stuff as seriously as you really know you should be. You catch yourself wincing and saying \u201cEwwww, that was a good one!\u201d like when Linda Blair's head goes round in The Exorcist.Credibility : I kind of think that fiction should tell the truth, but I also know it\u2019s made up. Hmmm. Serious fiction should tell the truth about humans, because unserious fiction just peddles the lies, myths and distortions we\u2019re all too familiar with. So if you\u2019re writing about Holocaust racism, as Kosinski is, you should make your story credible. I don\u2019t want to be saying hey, ten pages without a rape-murder, I bet there\u2019s one coming up soon \u2013 oh, here it is. In this way The painted Bird resembles something like Justine by de Sade \u2013 no plot, no characters, just lots of gruesome vignettes strung together. The reader is stultified.  Such a sensational novel brought Kosinski a lot of attention, and when you take a look at this guy, he turns out to be very interesting. He was like one of those 19th century \u201cadventurers\u201d, guys with dubious backgrounds who suddenly explode through the social firmament, charming and wowing the glitterati, then being revealed as frauds and charlatans. By subterfuge JK got himself out of communist Poland and within five minutes he\u2019d created this best-seller in his second language. I say \"created\" because there\u2019s some doubt about whether he actually wrote it. JK let it be understood that TPB might be autobiographical, and most of its first readers and reviewers accepted it as such \u2013 right now Amazon quotes the Merriam-Webster Encyclopaedia of Literature : \u201cThe ordeals of the central character parallel Kosinski's own experiences during World War II.\u201d But this was exposed in 1996 as a big fat lie when a biographer discovered that Jewish Jerzy and his family lived in Poland together throughout the war protected by all their Polish friends. No brutality, no ghettos for JK. So the best guess might be that JK took most of the stuff in his novel from unidentified Polish-language accounts of survival during the war, then paid translators to help him render the material into English. This isn\u2019t a bad thing, but it isn\u2019t the last word in scrupulousness either. Critics have noted that all of JK\u2019s novels are in different styles because he always worked with different translators and editors. (or, it has been whispered, different ghost-writers.) Back in Poland the communists banned it, which is nicely ironic as the adult who rescues the boy, finally, and becomes a father to him, briefly, is a communist and teaches the kid all about the workers\u2019 struggle. But you can see their point \u2013 this is an anti-Polish novel \u2013 no, an anti-Polish-peasant novel \u2013 no, an anti-Polish-peasant-during-WW2 novel \u2013 well, definitely one of those. In the end, this novel is a failure. But it's a brave, reckless, dangerous, blazing failure. Cinematic PS : I was watching Reds the other week and was mightily impressed by the actor playing Zinoviev. He had a hell of a face, hell of a haircut and a delivery that made his few scenes the most memorable of the 3 hour movie. And yes, that actor was Jerzy Kosinski. What a geezer!"}, {"userName": "Glenn Russell", "userReviewDate": "Nov 28, 2013", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/23385697-glenn-russell", "userReview": "The cover of the Mass Market Paperback edition from the 1970s of The Painted Bird features a small section of Hieronymus Bosch hell-landscape -- dressed in sickly green and wearing a white hood, a creature with a man's body and head of a long-beaked bird walks on crutches carrying a large wicker basket on its back, and in the basket a small black devil with spiky fingers touches the shoulder of a wary young boy as he whispers into the boy's ear. This is an apt cover for Jerzy Kosinski's fictionalized autobiographical novel set in Poland during the reign of Nazi terror in World War 11.I first read this harrowing tale thirty-five years ago. I have read many dark, disturbing novels filled with brutality of every stripe, including such works as Malamud's The Fixer, Dostoyevsky's The House of the Dead, and Solzhenitsyn's Gulag Archipelago, but, in my view, perhaps because the narrator is a ten year old boy, no novel has its main character live through a more painful hell than in The Painted Bird.Several months after reading this novel, the author himself made a visit to a large bookstore in Philadelphia for a book-signing, so I had an opportunity to actually meet him - a small man with a thin, high pitched voice and sharp, chiseled fine features, a man who struck me as being both sensitive and friendly. He appreciated my words of thanks and told me, when asked, that he was heading to New Orleans and expected to have some exciting times.Anyway, that was then. Several days ago I saw my local library had a copy of The Painted Bird audio book and immediately checked it out. I started also rereading the printed book as I listened to the audio. The reader, Fred Berman, did his homework - his accent and inflection and manner of speaking is spot-on Jerzy Kosinski.If you are unfamiliar, this story is of an orphan boy with black eyes and sharp nose, labeled gypsy-Jew, forced to wander from village to village, subjected physically to beatings, rape, tortures, as well as murder attempts, while subjected psychologically to being treated as a messenger of the devil and an evil spirit who casts spells with a glance from his black eyes.The boy is so traumatized from unrelenting abuse, he completely losses his capacity to speak for many months. The abuse reaches such a pitch, at one point he reflects on the nature of evil: \"I tried to visualize the manner in which the evil spirits operated. The minds and souls of people were as open to these forces as a plowed field, and it was on this field that the Evil Ones incessantly scattered their malignant seed. If their seed sprouted to life, if they felt welcomed, they offered all the help which might be needed, on the condition that it would be used for selfish purposes and only to the detriment of others. From the moment of signing a pact with the Devil, the more harm, misery, injury, and bitterness a man could inflict on those around him, the more help he could expect.\" Quite the musings from a ten year old! Just goes to show how extreme was his direct experience of the forces of evil.If you are up for an unforgettable experience of terror expressed in the clear, vivid literary language of a fine writer, then you are ready for The Painted Bird.\u201cThere's a place beyond words where experience first occurs to which I always want to return. I suspect that whenever I articulate my thoughts or translate my impulses into words, I am betraying the real thoughts and impulses which remain hidden.\u201d\u2015 Jerzy Kosinski, The Painted Bird"}, {"userName": "Emily May", "userReviewDate": "Sep 18, 2012", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/4622890-emily-may", "userReview": "Warning: I talk about a really gross and disturbing scene from the book in this review, please do not read if you're going to be upset and/or offended by talk of graphic sexual violence.This book is one of my dad's favourite books of all time, I don't know how many years he's been telling me to read it now and we've always had similar opinions on books before. But The Painted Bird did not live up to my expectations and the whole idea of it just left a very bad taste in my mouth.Pretty much anyone who's ever had some level of history education will have heard of some of the atrocities committed during the Holocaust, no matter how many times you read about human beings burning the children of other human beings and watching people slowly starve to death because of their race, religion or other factors, it is still just as shocking and horrifying. One of the areas sometimes neglected in these accounts of wartime cruelty is the suffering of non-German Jews and it may come as a shock to some to learn that more than 70% of those Jews murdered during Hitler's reign were actually from Poland and Russia. Also, all six extermination camps - as opposed to concentration camps - were located in Poland. [ * ]So when Jerzy Kosinski came stumbling out of communist Poland with a story about a young boy who was sent to the Polish countryside by his parents to hopefully protect him from the horrors going on in that area of Europe during this time, a young boy who moved from remote village to remote village, finding and enduring the worst kind of horrors imaginable along the way, most of Kosinski's readers wrongly assumed that this book was autobiographical. Rather than correcting his audience, Mr Kosinski rode the wave of popularity and did nothing to change these misconceptions. I suppose if someone wanted to give me a million for something I hadn't done I'd probably take the money and run too, so I don't really care that the author wasn't more vocal with the truth of this book. But... what I do think is that the knowledge that this novel is complete fiction - even if this stuff did happen somewhere - turns a potentially moving tale into a gratuitous torturefest.Just to compare this with S. - another fictional book about atrocities committed during war - I'm not saying that people cannot write successful fictional stories set during the holocaust or that it needs to be a memoir to be effective. But, where S. is a deeply moving tale that focuses on the internal effect had by the abuse which the captors inflicted upon their victims, The Painted Bird tells of a series of gruesome acts that vary from extreme beatings, to brutal rape scenes, to a man gouging out another man's eye with a spoon... and you have to ask yourself what he achieved other than making you feel physically ill at times. Pointless, mindless, disgusting scenes of violence that seem to me to be nothing but shock tactics. After a while of reading all these disturbing scenes, you start to feel like you're in a Saw movie, like the author is trying to create scenarios that are each more repulsive than the last just to play with the characters a bit more, make their lives a bit worse. Like raping a woman with a glass bottle and then kicking her abdomen until the glass shatters and she bleeds to death. And I do not mind reading gross scenes of violence as long as I feel it contributes something and isn't just there to keep me wide-eyed long enough that I forget the book isn't very well written and there's been no character development. I find it somewhat insulting to all those people who genuinely suffered during the holocaust that Kosinski would use it in a such an awful, emotionally-manipulative way.I feel like if I'd really wanted to experience violence, torture and rape without being moved in any way, then I could have just watched Game of Thrones. At least that has hot men for me to look at."}, {"userName": "BlackOxford", "userReviewDate": "Oct 25, 2017", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/17744555-blackoxford", "userReview": "[The unnamed protagonist loses contact with his parents at age six, and isn\u2019t reunited with them until after he turns twelve. During their separation, the boy is subject to the cruelty of the peasant society of rural Poland with its superstitious explanations of all natural phenomena, including the boy\u2019s dark hair which makes him anathema as either a Gypsy or a Jew. He is also from time to time subject to equivalent cruelty by the invading German Army, not because he is either a Gypsy or a Jew but because he is an orphan with no obvious productive contribution to military efficiency.After a period of understandable confusion, the boy tries desperately to make sense of his new reality. His first attempts involve treating his situation in terms of some rational standard: if he works hard, keeps his mouth shut, and obeys, he reckons he should be safe. Of course, he isn\u2019t. Cruelty increases without apparent cause or reason.Running away, the boy learns how to survive alone in a forest wilderness. But his isolation makes him vulnerable to capture by either the peasants or the Germans. Without communal protection he becomes doomed to a life of excruciating slavery. He then discovers what he thinks is both community and an explanation of his plight in the Christian religion. Prayer, he believes, is the answer to his suffering. If he can build enough credit with God, he will be delivered from injustice.But pray as he might nothing improves. In fact he is subject to extreme sexual abuse. He concludes not only that there is inherent, possibly irresistible evil in the world but that the odds apparently favour those who side decisively with the Demon who embodies evil. This Manichaean turn may be distasteful but it appears the only way to achieve justice for his tormentors. Captured by evil, he becomes mute.His next epiphany occurs with the defeat of the Germans by the Soviets. He is taken in, cared for, and politically indoctrinated by soldiers of the Red Army. He sees what Power is meant to be: protection of the weaker by the stronger. The fact that the reader may know of a dissonance between theory and practice in Soviet society is irrelevant to the boy\u2019s experience. He perceives this new form of power as salvation.But salvation is only temporary. Placed in an orphanage with all the other mutilated and mentally damaged children of war, new skills of survival are required. Justice, in particular, cannot be left to social institutions, but must be seen to personally and proportionately to the offences involved. He becomes a street kid, a child of the night, a friend to low lifes and misfits. And he is comfortable.Until his parents appear. Suffering a kind of Stockholm Syndrome, the boy considers his estranged parents as an inconvenient constraint on his freedom and potential. His fantasies and grandiose dreams of success are threatened by parental supervision. His peace is shattered by the existence of an annoying younger step-brother. He is fundamentally unfit for family life.The rediscovery of his voice on the ski slopes of Switzerland is a rather ambiguous conclusion that the boy doesn\u2019t comment upon. It\u2019s unclear whether Kosinski is suggesting some sort of post-traumatic recovery or merely an explanation for how the first-person story is told at all. It is nevertheless clear that his life will never be normal in any sense of the word.

Comparisons to the Saw films, torture porn, and complaints that the violence was simply all too gratuitous are the backbone of reviews that completely miss the point and should be dismissed out of hand. \"The purpose of a picaresque narrative is to present to the reader a picture of society and societal involvement that one would otherwise rather ignore, not all truths being pleasant ones.\" - Jerzy Kosinski's The Painted Bird and the Picaresque Tradition, Joseph V. Ricapito, in Neohelicon (1977) I strongly recommend reading the book from the very beginning; Start by reading Jerzy Kosinski's foreword. He discusses its reception, some of his motives for writing it, and the background to the story. He explains that this is fiction, he also explains, as he does in the pages of the novel, the phenomenon/tradition of a painted bird. This is the key motif to the story. Missing the significance here is missing the point entirely. As I mentioned above, most reviewers of this novel read it without even understanding it. He also says it was not an autobiographical account, so again, I don't see why reviewers on here have to bring up the controversy surrounding 'facts' in his fictional novel. That being said, Kosinski also mentions that, amidst the overwhelming criticism from his native Poland, where it was banned, some of the book's supporters were critical of his 'watered down' depiction of events, given that many occurrences that took place in Europe during the war were much more dramatic and cruel than those described in The Painted Bird. I tend to believe this; art imitates life, not the other way around. The novel follows a young city boy who is sent out to the countryside to stay away from the war. Unfortunately his parents didn't realize that the countryside is rife with primitive, illiterate peasants. Or maybe they did, but figured they are a better alternative to the invading Nazis. The trouble with this little boy is that he's got a darker complexion than the fair skinned, blond haired natives of the villages. Wherever he goes, he is immediately branded as the worst thing to be; a gypsy, or Jew (or both). In either case, the superstitious villagers despise and fear him (for his supposed evil powers). And then bad things happen to him.At one time in that part of the world, probably for entertainment, people would sometimes capture a bird and paint vivid colours over its feathers. They would then release the bird who flew straight back to its own. The flock, confused by the stranger's appearance, would begin to attack the painted bird and eventually kill it, not recognizing it as one of their own. The painted bird, in turn, would likely not understand why its feathery friends were trying to kill it. The allegory Kosinski makes is very simple in my eyes. The boy, a living, breathing human being, is not recognized as one of their own by confused and uneducated peasants. Each beating and humiliating act that he endures is a violent peck against his outward appearance. Simple. The novel is called The Painted Bird. Does anyone really believe it's just a quirky title related to the tradition of painting a bird's feathers?Then there were some things that just somehow made it difficult to take seriously. It often reads like a grocery list of superstitions and neo-pagan beliefs. Recipes for simple ailments that involve ground bones, horse teeth, and various secretions. I found the description of these potions more disgusting than the violence for the most part. The superstitions were everywhere though:- The belief that gypsies have the power to kill by looking in one's eyes. - The need to spit three time in any gypsies' direction to counter the 'death-look'. - Hiding/covering one's teeth when smiling in case a gypsy might count them (and take that amount of years off your life). - The myriad of demons and spirits who roam the forests and the fields. - The rope of a suicidee that's meant to bring good luck. These, and many many more, became fact by the end of book. They certainly became fact for our anti-hero who himself came to believe the very same things. Kosinsky also describes some situations that read as if straight out of Borat. The Polish peasant is made to look stupider and more ignorant than any other being on the planet. From this point of view, I'm not surprised it was banned in commie Poland. Finally, I'm going to add a personal note. I grew up in a place where corporal punishment was still doled out at school. I had strangers who were very mean to me as kid, when I was the same age as Kosinsky's 'painted bird'. I had my hair and ears pulled undeservedly by adults. I went to school with kids who'd clearly been badly beaten at home. I had the back of my hands smacked by the teacher's ruler. I was slapped by a doctor once for crying. In my eyes, adults were large creatures to be feared. They loved to scare and hurt kids. They were mean, cruel people. And this was in the 80s, in a city, and I didn't look different from anybody else. Yes it\u2019s unbelievable that one child could suffer so much to our coddled Western minds, but to think that a child at the mercy of a bunch of uneducated, backwater type, Eastern European rednecks, during the blood orgy that was the Second World War, would not have to endure much much worse is naive. I too believe that given the setting and circumstances, Kosinski offers a watered-down narrative. I can't give this five stars because I think Kosinski could've gone further with the material and subject matter at hand. Both from the perspective of the narrative and from a literary point of view. It was, at times, too two-dimensional, and I breezed right through it. Although that's the point of the picaresque novel it's hard not to ask for more. I enjoyed it for the historical context very much, and for an accurate reflection of our human condition. Maybe I just wish he'd shown it as a painting instead of a caricature."}, {"userName": "Nickolas the Kid", "userReviewDate": "Nov 05, 2016", "userURL":

The author originally said it was autobiographical. It is now classified as fiction. IF it were autobiographical it would be easier to swallow; you'd think that is just plain what happened. The book is incredibly difficult to read. It is surreal in tone, filled with graphic sexuality and violence. What is delivered is man at his worst told in such a way as to make the reader cringe. To what purpose? Published in 1965, was there then a need to exalt in the horrors of the war?The author was also accused of plagiarism. If you want more information, search at Wiki by the title of the book and the author's name. I listened to the audiobook narrated by Fred Berman. The narration was fine.

He states that there was a certain peasant custom he witnessed as a child before in which he describes it as follows:\n\"One of the villagers' favorite entertainment was trapping birds, painting their feathers, and then releasing them in the air to rejoin their flock. As these brightly colored creatures sought the safety of their fellows, the other birds, seeing them as threatening aliens, attacked and tore at the outcasts until they killed them.\"\n Due to the controversial nature and content of this book, I was surprised that I even stumbled upon a copy about a year ago while once again casually flipping through the general section of a bookstore. I've only known about the book months prior to acquiring it, and I was so excited to start reading it on a scheduled time. Some months later, I did just that and for two days I was immersed in witnessing the ugliest and most vile horrors I have ever read in fiction that were loosely based from real-life accounts of people who lived through the second World War. There was nothing about this book I enjoyed, to be honest. It was psychologically painful and slightly numbing to peruse through, especially with each chapter dealing with deprived deviant acts of the social and sexual kind. That being said, this is a spectacular novel that examines the darker and sickening aspects of human nature, and it was successful in its depiction because I don't think any decent person would enjoy the varying degrees of cruelty and degradation that Kosinski have shared in The Painted Bird.The Painted Bird follows the travels of a six-year-old Jewish boy in Central Europe, and whose parents have sent him away in beliefs that he would fare better away from the heart of the warfare and Nazism at the time. What happens mainly instead over the course of the book is that the boy was forced to grow up very quickly, robbed of another option, as he stays in one village after another, more often discriminated against, beaten up and rarely cared for. As a book that deals with the Holocaust, Kosinski managed to stay away from events surrounding the actual prison or labor camps where the Jews were gassed or incinerated. We all know that's where the real horror lies but Kosinski challenged this idea and revealed to us that in times of warfare, even the most modest of places such as rural villages can be sources of the most potent evil human beings are capable of. This book delved deeply on the shocking ways that antisemitic sentiment, religious persecution and barbaric superstitions could turn people into hateful creatures; that even the simple folk back then can and will ruefully participate in terrible acts, often justifying their malicious intentions as divine interventions, against the boy himself, and any Jewish or Gypsy person of the same ilk who would pass their way. I don't think it's worth specifying these truly disgusting and abhorrent events here in my review, mostly because I'm still sick to my stomach just thinking about them. Even the subtlest ways of these people when it comes to their maltreatment of the boy just because he has black hair and dark eyes (and therefore an abomination to God) were chilling in retrospect. So, yes, I did not enjoy reading this book but I was fully hypnotized into trudging along each chapter anyway.I could then claim that this was a great exercise on moral conscience and inherent human compassion on the end of the readers such as myself who have developed a certain keen sense of cynicism over the years regarding the world at large. I am not shocked easily by gory details but I have to admit that this book made me feel bad every time I try to insert some humor in my initial thoughts in Goodreads for the reading updates while reading. It doesn't feel like a subject to be made light of, personally, but it was also the only way I can endure reading the chapters--I had to find some sort of morbid amusement and detachment just so I don't get thoroughly disheartened. What was so moving about this novel, however, was the main character of the boy who remains unnamed throughout, but whose iron will and resilient youth had made it possible for him to come out on the other side alive, though fragmented and forever changed. Children are tougher than we give them credit for, and I was comforted with the fact that he was resourceful in adapting to multiple situations where his own life and innocence are fully at stake. This book features tons of examples of mob mentality (the likes of which are awfully symbolized by the painted-birds analogy Kosinski has utilized), as well as separate incidents of incest and bestiality, and a rather disconcerting abundance of gang rapes at the later part of the book where a whole chapter is devoted describing the entire thing in painstakingly gross detail. This is not a book meant for enjoyment so if you happen to decide you want to read it, please remember what I just said in this review.The Painted Bird also operates on the wisdom that there are no happy lives, just happy moments, and about fifty pages near the end, the readers are allowed to view snapshots of the boy's life in the aftermath of the fall of the Third Reich and though there was nothing immediately uplifting about it, it's the best happy ending he could make out of from the traumatic experiences that have shaped him, and malformed him somehow. Personally, I didn't expect that there's going to be a healing message by the end of this tragic tale anyway. I think the ambiguity of the resolution for The Painted Bird accomplishes what it was set out to do in the first place: to remind readers that the darkness hovering in our lives is real and it could seep through the cracks, whether or not we allow it. But the real test of courage and spiritual enlightenment is on how we cope and deal with the poison that corrodes our systems, and I would like to believe against hope that we can rise above our own base impulses towards hatred, ignorance and persecution. There is corruption and sickness in the world, yes, but we all should strive to be the balm on its infected pores. The Painted Bird, after showing me so much inhumane and malicious acts that people do to each other, has also reminded me of my humanity and the blessings and burdens of ensuring I don't give in to the call of moral decay and disintegration of values, no matter how easy (and even remotely tempting) it is to act like lesser beings.RECOMMENDED: 9/10DO READ MY REVIEWS AT"}, {"userName": "Carmo", "userReviewDate": "Apr 04, 2015", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/15850971-carmo", "userReview": "Quando Hitler invade a Pol\u00f3nia e come\u00e7a a selecionar popula\u00e7\u00e3o para os campos de concentra\u00e7\u00e3o, um casal tenta salvar o filho deixando-o com uma idosa numa aldeia miser\u00e1vel no meio da floresta.A porta de fuga tornou-se a porta de entrada num mundo de horror t\u00e3o cruel quanto os guetos nazis.Quando a mulher morre num inc\u00eandio, ele parte sozinho e aqui come\u00e7a a saga de persegui\u00e7\u00e3o e fuga, deambulando de aldeia em aldeia por entre a floresta, procurando abrigo e, sobretudo, aceita\u00e7\u00e3o e algum carinho.Em todas \u00e9 apontado como cigano ou judeu.

"userReview": "This review is serving as a spiritual tug of war. The Battle of the Conscious. I really don\u2019t know what to think. I hesitate between 2 and 3 stars and Yeah, I know\u2026 I\u2019m a heartless bitch. The guilt tells me to rate it higher because of all the persecution and just plain ol\u2019 Horrors that this kid dealt with. As if I\u2019ve lost some humanity if I don\u2019t appreciate this more. But\u2026 another part of me is just not feeling it. It sort of feels like rubbernecking. Like, it starts off right away with exploding pet squirrels and just gets more and more unbelievable as you go. I\u2019m not saying that this stuff couldn\u2019t have happened (well, maybe I am, but not to ONE person...)and I am well aware that as a French Canadian child born in 1970\u2019s New England I would have NO BASIS on which to judge the monstrosities that this un-named child endured. But, it\u2019s not really real, you know? No? Okay, then I\u2019m colder than I thought. I can\u2019t get past the fact that this kid really isn\u2019t ever given a break\u2026 We go through about 200 pages of beatings and rapes and mutilations and near deaths and you (me) start to roll your eyes and think that Charlie Brown could take some life lessons from this little gypsy boy. I felt guilty! I shouldn\u2019t be exasperated by this! I should be appalled! I should be weeping and thanking unknown deities that my lame childhood was all about having to walk to McDonalds and clean the pool. But, what did I do? I started skimming. Blah-Blah-beating-Blah-Blah-hanging from a hook to avoid certain death from vicious dog-blah blah-skinning a live rabbit-blah blah-thrown in a dung heap---Blah Blah---you get the picture. The only thread of compassion that I hold onto is that I didn\u2019t feel this way when I read Anne Frank The Diary of a Young Girl or Night. I\u2019m not a monster. (Right?) Maybe it was the writing style, the dispassionate, removed, telling of these events. Then interspersed with these flowing images of painted birds and sexual awakenings (rape or not.) It was difficult to juxtapose between these styles and stay in the moment. My breath would catch at a particularly moving passage like:I had seen the end of terror that shakes one until it squeezes the stomach empty of vomit, like a punctured poppy pod blown open by the wind.Then move a few paragraphs to:I began to practice walking. My legs did not obey me and I tired easily. One night I heard noises outside. I peered through a slot between the boards. You lose the rhythm, the fantasy, and hit the mundane again. My addled brain couldn\u2019t handle it. I read that Kosinski may have gone all James Frey with this and \u2018embellished\u2019 the tale but from what I\u2019ve read, he never really said it wasn\u2019t fiction, right? I mean, others fought to find meaning and truth behind the tale. Then there\u2019s the controversy surrounding plagiarism and then all those health issues he had\u2026 Poor guy, no wonder he committed suicide. (See? Compassion!)So, I\u2019m glad that I read this. I have Being There and I\u2019ve been wanting to read that for awhile\u2026 not realizing it was the same author. Only now, I\u2019m not so excited.

I\u2019ve read many, many holocaust era books and I\u2019d already read quite a few when I read this one. And this says a lot, but this one might be the most horrifying one of them all. This was one of the most disturbing books I\u2019ve ever read and yet I loved the book. I read it thinking it was non-fiction; years after I read it, I read that it was fiction, but that doesn\u2019t diminish at all the impact I feel from reading it. It\u2019s truly amazing what people can do to each other and also what people will go through in order to survive.

His supreme ability to tell a child's horrific coming-of-age story in rural Nazi-controlled Poland, where the peasants are just as gruesomely sadistic, with adult credibility and moral authority without overreaching or sentimentality, is a dark and bittersweet triumph of humanity and then also of literature. IMHO, the book was not written as an invective against Polish peasants or Nazis alone, any more than it is solely an indictment of human nature in wartime. Kosi\u0144ski's scalpel cut too deep to the marrow to stop at Mitka-style revenge. His truth lies deeper than in paranoia and suspicion of man; it exposes the harrowing duality of man's nature, sharpened to extremes in wartime - by turns cruel and tender, superstitious and rational, vengeful and forgiving, brutal and sophisticated. The Painted Bird is the strongest, most harrowing novel I've ever read and it will stay with me for life, both as a Jew, human being and as a writer.

The horror of that past that is in the memory of so many who lived it cannot serve as background to a symbolic and imaginary horror constantly outside the [realm] of the probable.\u201dI think the same problem applies to the Painted Bird. This book isn't technically an adaptation of Sade, but clearly belongs to the subgenre of Sadean pornography. The protagonist is basically Justine as a prepubescent boy, able to endure endless cruelty and mutilation with no apparent alteration to his physical or psychological integrity. For years the book's authenticity was a matter of debate, but it's hard to believe anyone ever took this seriously as a literal description of wartime Poland. (For the record: Kosinski survived the war in relative comfort, sheltered by brave and compassionate Polish peasants who would have all been shot if the Nazis discovered what they were doing.) What purpose could it possibly serve to take a historical situation that was so terrible it can't be exaggerated and then make it the scene of cartoonish, implausible horrors?Luckily, the Painted Bird is a book, not a movie, and a book written in a fairly bland style, so unlike Salo its horrors are pretty easily forgotten."}, {"userName": "Leigh", "userReviewDate": "Jun 14, 2007", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/122484-leigh", "userReview": "One of the most difficult books I've ever read.

In no way an enjoyable read, and surprising only in the creativity of its cruelty.(Note of interest: reputedly, Kosinski was supposed to be at Roman Polanski's house on the night in 1969 when the Manson Family murdered five people there. He missed it thanks to a baggage delay at the airport.)"}, {"userName": "Perihan", "userReviewDate": "Jul 17, 2017", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/47956300-perihan", "userReview": "\"Ma\u011flup edilemeyen bir i\u00e7g\u00fcd\u00fcyle benzerlerine ko\u015fan Lekh'in boyal\u0131 ku\u015fu gibiydim.\" (Sayfa 233, e Yay\u0131nlar\u0131)Kitap ger\u00e7ekten de \u00e7ok sars\u0131c\u0131yd\u0131!Sava\u015f d\u00f6neminde ya\u015fanan insanl\u0131k d\u0131\u015f\u0131 haller, birbiri ard\u0131na ya\u015fanan, a\u015f\u0131r\u0131 \u015fiddet i\u00e7eren ve uygunsuz i\u00e7erik ta\u015f\u0131yan olaylar...Bence bu kitap i\u00e7eri\u011fi sebebiyle okunmas\u0131 ruha ve y\u00fcre\u011fe a\u011f\u0131rl\u0131k veren en a\u011f\u0131r kitaplardan...Anlat\u0131m dili \u00e7ok ak\u0131c\u0131 ama anlat\u0131lanlar i\u00e7 a\u00e7\u0131c\u0131 de\u011fil:(Kitab\u0131n ad\u0131 olan boyal\u0131 ku\u015fun \u00f6yk\u00fcs\u00fc ise bence olduk\u00e7a vurucuydu!\u015e\u00f6yle ki,kitab\u0131n ana karakteri olan Yahudi k\u00fc\u00e7\u00fck \u00e7ocuk, sava\u015f zaman\u0131 \u00f6ld\u00fcr\u00fcl\u00fcr korkusuyla , annesi ve babas\u0131 taraf\u0131ndan bir adama emanet edilir.
