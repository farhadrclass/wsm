I kept thinking I'd never finish the book if I had to read it, and was almost gleeful when there were only 2 cds (of 17) left and the end was in sight! That ending is not only depressing, but there is no satisfying resolution. Whistling Season is much better, and you'll like the ending, but this not one. I read it first and consider it one of the best books I read this year, so I read this hoping for more of the same but was hugely disappointed. The story drags; I wanted to slap the 2 main characters upside the head; and there is precious little humor in it.

There were many elements that make this a five star book for me. First, the writing is poetic and delicately stated. Second, the history of the setting places the story in a very nostalgic period of American homesteading. I love the setting. For some reason I feel particularly connected to the late 1800's and early 1900's. The wild Montana frontier life during this period fascinates me and completely captured my imagination in this novel. Next, the story of friendship and family connections was compelling and sober. While many may disagree that this is Doig's weakest part of the writing, I think that the relationships remind me faintly of the classical Don Quixote and Sancho Panza duo. I realize that I see Quixote and Sancho in literature like a Guadelupan sees the Virgin in fabric. However, Angus the romantic seem as impractical as Quixote. Further, I found beauty in the consequences of fanciful sentimentalism in a Montana homesteader. You simply can't afford wasting anything in Montana, most of all your heart. Its a truly frontier response to the Quixote question of whether its noble to be delusional. Additionally, Rob's pragmatism parallels Sancho. Rob's pragmatism like Angus's romantacism, leads to disaster. His pragmatism leads him to believe too much in manifest destiny. He believed too strongly that the world was his to bend to his will. Montana proved too powerful for even someone as stubborn as a Barclay. Thus, Doig rewrites the pragmatist as every bit as delusional as a romantic. He made the classic Quixote model his own and interpreted it beautifully and convincingly through the lens of a frontiersman. The novel is a masterpiece. There are some obvious issues other reviewers address. Many complain that Angus couldn't have been so manly and mature in so many ways but remained emotionally immature with his lifelong infatuation of his first love. I agree that this is almost unbelievable. However, realistic characters can't be average and like everyone in every category, otherwise, they are simply characters compiled of statistics. A character written to statistical probabilities can be no more believable than one possessing abnormalities of the heart. I find an additional concern more persuasive. Angus and Rob's eventual falling out led to a life ending in years of enmity towards one another. The book concluded beautifully as a result of this enmity. However, the premise that the enmity was naturally related to Angus's misplaced love might be too much for even me (a man always seeing Quixote in every novel). Thus, perhaps the enmity should have been more developed so not to strain the imagination as much as was required. Yet, I find myself inspired by the story driven by the enmity and resist dwelling upon the underdeveloped justification for it because in the end the enmity climaxed with beautiful symbolism. I was utterly moved when at the conclusion a Sancho (Rob) rides Quixote's heart (Angus's horse) into ice cold water, drowning both Sancho and the heart of Quixote. I can only feel grateful the enmity existed so I could witness the beautifully rendered conclusion to a thoroughly enjoyable novel."}, {"userName": "Steven Walle", "userReviewDate": "Mar 21, 2015", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/37850168-steven-walle", "userReview": "In the book \"Dancing at The Rascal Fair\" Ivan Doig describes a wonderful story of perceverience, adventure, exploration and love.

But it also is very sad, showing the hardships the pioneers had to endure in the terrible Montana winters, the loss of animals, the difficulties of sheepherding, and an additional story of unrequited love.

I figured I'd dip into it dutifully, find it mind-numbing, and then sit respectfully by as the more dedicated members of our bookclub dissected it. What I did not expect is that the writing would suck me in from the earliest pages, and that the page-turner plotting would keep me interested until the end.The trick is, that despite the incredible amount of archival research that must have gone into creating this tale of Scottish immigrants to the upper northwest of Montana in the 1890s, the book is really good ole' soap opera. It starts on the Glasgow docks with two teenage friends watching in horror as a horse slips into the water and drowns. They then embark on a fearsome trans-Atlantic crossing, and make their way to Montana, where one of them has a prosperous uncle who immigrated years before. What follows are the next 25-30 years of trials and tribulations as the two friends homestead and become sheep ranchers in the vicinity of what is now Glacier National Park. Key to the story are the romantic lives of the two men, and how various triumphs and disappointments feed and starve their own friendship.I won't get into all the twists and turns of the plot, but there's plenty there to keep one reading on. Woven in are how the larger forces of the world (weather, war, viruses) kick aside the best-laid plans of even honest, hard-working people. Doig's dialogue is chock full of keen turns of phrase, and his descriptions of physical landscape are striking without feeling overwrought. Definitely recommended to anyone from Montana, and anyone who's at all interested in what the life of a homesteading American would have been at the time."}, {"userName": "Della O'Shea", "userReviewDate": "Oct 08, 2012", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/9536424-della-o-shea", "userReview": "When I was a child, I had a wooden puzzle map of the United States. I was especially drawn to the \"Montana\" piece and remember telling my older sister I wanted to live there when I was grown up. I am now 63 and had never been to Montana, until I went there with Ivan Doig in this novel, which opens in 1889. Doig's words paint a beautiful description of the prairies and mountains, so vivid that they easily matched the photos of the Badger-Two Medicine portion of the Lewis and Clark National Forest that I found on-line while immersed in the story. The central characters of Scottish immigrants, Angus and Rob, were well defined and their story of traversing the land and their decades-long brotherly friendship was continually captivating. Their connection to each other and to the women in their lives reflect the jagged highs and lows of the surrounding Rockies. Their courage, strength and determination is shared with their fellow homesteaders and I frequently found myself admiring the lives they built on the frontier, on \"land available for the taking\", while just over the horizon, I was painfully aware of the cost to Native American lives and culture. This book, however, barely touches on that historical conflict, and instead kept me focused on the characters; their struggles to live lives of value amid the harsh and unpredictable emotional territory and physical environment they encountered. I loved reading this book, so although I have 20+ books waiting on my \"to read\" shelf, I am currently at the library, checking out the second in Doig's Two-Medicine trilogy, \"English Creek\". This next book continues the story of Angus's son, Varick, beginning in 1939.

It's got so much going for it and it covers so much good ground. The book begins with a pair of young Scots immigrating to Montana in the 1880s. Filled with the boundless energy of youth and full of possibility they arrived in a virtually unpopulated land of incredible beauty. It follows their lives as they claim prime homestead land and sees them through the hardships, of which there are many, and the triumphs of which there are also quite a few. Sheep ranchers are what they become. First as bachelors, then as men with wives and children, and then as men and women feeling the toll of years of hard work, but satisfied at what they've created and of having put the next generation into the world. They endure the vagaries of changing climate and uncertain economy, the influenza epidemic of 1918 and World War I. They live to see their beloved Montana filling up with a population and civilizing influences. By the end of the book some have suffered fatally bad luck. Some have given up and quit the country, others have just gotten by and others have done better than that.Ivan Doig's research to prepare for this book was painstaking and extensive and it shows.

Angus' love interest is not developed sufficiently to enable us to grasp the basis for his passion. When others describe it as a schoolboy infatuation, it seems apt. The character Adair is less remote but her level of self abnegation is a puzzlement, largely because the author seemed to portray it as a strength. I was less enchanted with the writing than many of the reviewers and generally found the book to be bloated. I became weary of his lengthy descriptions of the mountains. I recognize that sense of place is crucial for this novel, in the same way it is for a Hardy novel. For me, though, the landscape description became a thing in its own right. Still, the novel does have its charms. Doig provides male characters that are much more intricately developed than his female characters and his exploration of the relationship between Rob and Angus is compelling (even though in the culminating scene, I had greater sadness for the demise of the horse--I'll bet others did, too).

It prompted me to do a little investigating as to how my own ancestors got to this country. It's also been 15 years since I read the other books in the trilogy - English Creek and Ride with me Mariah Montana, but I remember enjoying them as well."}], "description": "The central volume in Ivan Doig's acclaimed Montana trilogy, \"Dancing at the Rascal Fair\" is an authentic saga of the American experience at the turn of this century and a passionate, portrayal of the immigrants who dared to try new lives in the imposing Rocky Mountains.Ivan Doig's supple tale of landseekers unfolds into a fateful contest of the heart between Anna Ramsay and Angus McCaskill, walled apart by their obligations as they and their stormy kith and kin vie to tame the brutal, beautiful Two Medicine country.", "title": "Dancing at the Rascal Fair\n      \n          (Two Medicine Trilogy #2)", "url": "http://www.goodreads.com/book/show/18995283-dancing-at-the-rascal-fair", "average": 4.22, "cover": "https://images.gr-assets.com/books/1385527162l/18995283.jpg", "reviews": 521, "authors": [{"url": "https://www.goodreads.com/author/show/70540.Ivan_Doig", "name": "Ivan Doig"}], "type": ["Fiction", "Historical", "Westerns", "Literature"], "outlinks": ["http://www.goodreads.com/book/show/18995283-dancing-at-the-rascal-fair", "http://www.goodreads.com/book/show/10327242-dancing-at-the-rascal-fair", "http://www.goodreads.com/book/show/2809939-dancing-at-the-rascal-fair", "http://www.goodreads.com/book/show/122311.Dancing_at_the_Rascal_Fair", "http://www.goodreads.com/book/show/1862083.Dancing_at_the_Rascal_Fair", "http://www.goodreads.com/book/show/16372464-dancing-at-the-rascal-fair", "http://www.goodreads.com/book/show/262545.The_Whistling_Season", "http://www.goodreads.com/book/show/24611732-last-bus-to-wisdom", "http://www.goodreads.com/book/show/13593541-the-bartender-s-tale", "http://www.goodreads.com/book/show/576379.This_House_of_Sky", "http://www.goodreads.com/book/show/165422.English_Creek"]}
