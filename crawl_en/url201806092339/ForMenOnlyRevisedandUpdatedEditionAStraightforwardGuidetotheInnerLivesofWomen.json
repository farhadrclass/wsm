Most of my confidantes have always been from the female gender. I love their friendship. I know them. But this book has often made me feel that women are a bunch of simple-minded, confused, all too emotional creatures. Well, not \"my women\"! Don't get me wrong. The book has some good points to make and they are good for men to keep in mind, but still women are not as shallow as he makes them to be in that book, and neither are they a bunch of creatures who don't know what they want. My best advisors have always been women. When I can be emotionally unstable, it is women who are more solid than I can ever be!"}, {"userName": "Seth", "userReviewDate": "Feb 03, 2009", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/759164-seth", "userReview": "This book is helpful to understanding women. There are two clear ideas that I earned from this book that I haven't gained elsewhere.1. Women's preoccupations can't just be laid to rest by arguing out their merit. They are like programs open on a computer. You can minimize them but they can't just go away until the anxiety is directly resolved. The little \"x\" can be closed only when resolved.2. Women have just as strong a need to be \"pursued romantically\" as men have being \"sexually desired\". I started looking for ways to make my wife remain in a constant state of romance and it has made a huge difference on her quality of life. That is why I am giving it so many stars. The quality of the writing and the insight of the author's were not close to impressive. They were kind of goofy and simplistic. Its a short book and doesn't address any particular deficiency. It is a very brief overview of what women need from men to feel love. The ideas that I gained were sufficient to recommend the book. Don't look for brilliant marriage guidance here, however, you might find a few ideas that could improve your marriage."}, {"userName": "Brandon", "userReviewDate": "Mar 12, 2009", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/1253293-brandon", "userReview": "It's Ok (ish). Has a few interesting insights, and the statistics seem useful. You have to get over the writing though, it feels like it's written to the lowest common denominator among men. As if their working assumption is men are not capable of reading beyond the 3rd grade level. Meanwhile, the author keeps trying to convince us of his new found authority on the subject via his immersion into the world of women, and, well, it gets old. His authority is the research/statistics, which get don't as much attention or analysis as I would have liked. The book has a really annoying feature of \"highlighting\" sentences pulled from the text but putting them in a large font. The problem is, the text will read something like (see p142): \"That's an easy chip shot if I ever saw one.\" Then immediatly below, in a larger font with a geometric bullet \"That's an easy chip shot if I ever saw one.\" Why? Reading through it is painful. Every couple of pages this strange quoting mechanism is used. I found it really annoying. I walked away with a few discussion points I'll bring up with my wife, but overall was somewhat insulted by it's presentation and disappointed by its lack of depth."}, {"userName": "Robin DeJarnett", "userReviewDate": "Apr 28, 2010", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/1238181-robin-dejarnett", "userReview": "If you read my review on Ms. Feldhahn's other book, 'For Women Only,' I think you won't be surprised that the same criticism applies here.This book states up front that the authors' intent is to grossly generalize their findings, and they do. I was hoping for more than just a flip of what was in 'For Women Only' but there wasn't really any new information here - in fact it seemed to lack the depth of the first book.The first book highlighted more specifics, like how men enjoyed it when their women 'played with them' - enjoyed the same diversions, like golf or even just watching sports together. I didn't see the opposite in FMO - what is it that women enjoy for their man to do with them?There seemed (to me) to be an inordinate amount of time spent on a women's appearance (in each of the chapters), which I found shallow. Obviously, as a woman, I understand how important appearance is, but there's so much more to me than that. Men may be visual, but wasn't the point of this book to show them what they CAN'T see? Both books also imply that any infidelity in a marriage will always involve the man and his lustful, wandering eye. Whether women are visual or not (and I know for a fact many are), they have their own escapes, be it through soap operas, romance novels or some other source. Neither book addresses the feminine side of lust or a man's reaction/interpretation of it.There are tidbits to be gleaned, both for men and women, but as before, I recommend that couples look at this book together, and consider the lens used to write it."}, {"userName": "Chip Rodgers", "userReviewDate": "May 04, 2012", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/3710872-chip-rodgers", "userReview": "It's not that this book was bad per se.

This book helped a lot to understand my woman. I have never though about women this way before, i guess I should have considered reading such book before. Though, I would not think other books would put it the same way this one did. I am just glad I had the chance to read it.Chapter 1. Interesting! I got hooked. Chapter 2. If you get together, the deal is never close. Insecurity follows women even after settling down. Unlike men who want to show their love by their actions, women need reassuring every time they have a conflict. As a man I need to increase her emotional bank account by continue doing the small stuff that made me win her heart at the beginning. When she is upset, I should not leave her to think alone, I should hug her and assure her all is going to be okay.Chapter 3.I can see it. Its too hard for a woman to just let go of hear fears and worries, because they are attached to her emotions. Worries will go away when the bad feelings are gone, as men we need to help our women by resolving these emotional issues not by telling them \"just don't worry or forget about it\". Telling my women such thing, will either make the problem stick or circulate. Listen to your woman's concerns, give her all your ears, hug her, suggest an action for her worries, or take one. Chapter 4.When you see or feel something is wrong between you and your women, ask her what's wrong? Don't accept \" I am fine\" as an answer, but be persistent and assume she is upset b/c of something you did or you did not do. Speak to her, tell her that you might did something wrong and ask her to help you to understand her. If the issue is not your actions, assume its an emotional issues, give her your ears and listen carefully. The third reason she could be upset about is her circumstances, take your time to understand her. Lastly, it could be just hormones, be there for her. An important note to remember is that women don't speak about their issues from the first time b/c we \"men\" trained them not to. We usually get angry or defensive when they answer our question the first time we ask.Chapter 5. Financial security is not more important than emotional one. Most women prefer low income job and more time with their husbands more than high income and low parent and husband time. She wants to feel 1) You are close to her; do small silly stuff like the stuff you used to do before marrying her, ex. Sending text message in the middle of the day and buying her flowers or surprise her with what she loves. 2) She wants to feel that she is a priority, spend more time with her, let her feel she is before everything. 3) She wants to see more commitment to her, ex. help her around the house. 4) She wants to see you making effort to provide financial stability for the family. Chapter 6.The power of effective listening. Your women speaks about an emotional difficulty, she just wants to share her feelings with her partner. She is not sharing to look for solutions. When she speaks, drop the 'I must fix it' attitude and and listen carefully to her feelings through her words, facial expressions, and body gestures. Try to understand her, repeat those feeling to her to assure her that you gave her your attention. Sharing her feelings with you, and you understanding those feelings is more important to her than the problem itself.Chapter 7. This chapter is on the sexual relationship between you and her, and how her \"NO\" to sex does not mean it is because of you. Understand that she could be tired from all day long, and her sexual drive is less than you. She may not want to have sex with you, but she will enjoy it as much as you when she is in the action. Her sexual desire rise not as sharply as yours, so take your time with her. Your appearance and look does not make her hot, she needs to feel the closeness between you two beyond the bedroom. Be close to her at all time. Try to start talking about sex early before jumping into it, to prepare her emotionally, like whisper to her that you want to have sweets when you get home while having dinner at the restaurant. Tell her you are excited and cannot wait. Chapter 8. The little girl still lives inside her. She needs constant complements on how beautiful and stunning she is. As in chapter 2, she needs to hear from you that she is beautiful, never assume she knows and does not need to hear it. Tell her how magnificent she looks, be specific when complementing her. If she asks about how beautiful she looks, don't answer just fine. Notice her dress when she spends time in front of the mirror, tell her what you like about her style.Chapter 9. (The conclusion)I should always remember that I am her HERO."}, {"userName": "J.

(\"Weirdly poorly written\": it was clearly within the authors' power to write more impressively/ smoothly, but they decided that it was better to take a totally unsophisticated stance-- there was the textual equivalent of a lot of winking and elbow-nudging going on in here, and it comes off as too 'familiar' in the old sense, or 'chummy' in the new.)However, the end of the book was well done, and brave, as well (\"we simply need a zero-tolerance policy on porn\"). Some parts, too, did in fact help me understand the beautiful mystery that is my wife a little bit better. So it accomplished its purpose, and for that I am grateful (though I think it may have been better served to be edited and reissued as a twenty-page pamphlet)."}, {"userName": "Chelsea Rivas", "userReviewDate": "Feb 20, 2018", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/49477197-chelsea-rivas", "userReview": "There is some decent advice in this book, but you'll have to mine for it through the insultingly chummy delivery, Old Sport. As part of his \"good ol' boys\" delivery, more than once co-author Jeff Feldhahn used dehumanizing language when referring to both men and women, which was off-putting and unnecessary. My husband is a human being, not a \"cromagnon\". I am a human being, not an \"alien\". Furthermore, throughout the book Feldhahn insists that each husband needs to reassure his wife that she is beautiful. I disagree. It is MUCH more important that each husband reassure his wife that she is loved and valued for her brain and her heart...not what her face looks like or what size jeans she wears. Of course it is lovely to be complimented, but it is so much more important to be valued for who I am, not what I look like. My main concern with this book, however, is Feldhahn's discomfort in discussing women's bodies. He is clearly uncomfortable using words such as \"menstrual cycle\", \"menstruation\", or even \"cycle\" or \"period.\" He instead refers to it as \"her circumstances\" and \"er...um...her situation\" (in the audiobook version he literally says, \"er...um...her situation\" with the intonation that you're \"in\" on his private little joke). He writes that sometimes one of his male friends asks his wife, \"Am I talking to my sweet wife Lori, or Helga the crazed mutant?\" 'Helga the crazed mutant'? Seriously? I don't think Lori truly finds this funny (as he claims in the book). I think it's more likely that Lori does a courtesy laugh to avoid having a difficult conversation with her husband because either 1) She knows she doesn't appreciate what he said but isn't sure herself WHY it doesn't sit well with her, or 2) She knows he won't understand why she can't just \"take a joke\". It does a tremendous disservice to men and women for this stereotype of \"crazed mutant\" to be perpetuated. Yes, a woman's menstrual cycle can cause hormonal changes that translate to behavior changes. But she does not transform into a 'crazed mutant'. She is still the 'sweet wife' she has always been. If my husband was experiencing a hormonal imbalance (or a recurring cycle of hormonal imbalances), I would never refer to him as a 'crazed mutant'. It's insulting and dehumanizing, and is therefore devoid of empathy...the exact opposite of what he could and should reasonably expect from a loving spouse. For someone in a position of authority, whose goal is for men to follow his advice and/or example, it's tragic that Feldhahn--claiming 'delicacy'--squandered the opportunity to set a better example in this regard. With just a few differences in wording, he could've shown men that it is right and proper to use correct terminology instead of euphemisms. He could've challenged men to be respectful and continue to grant humanity where it is due. He could've helped men understand that the uterine functions are not to be feared, tip-toed around, or insulted under the guise of joking.Later in the book he does the same thing when addressing orgasm. Again, for someone who claims to be an authority, he missed a tremendous opportunity to educate, demystify, and call upon men to grant their wives even the most basic dignity. \"For Women Only\" was written under the assumption that its audience is intelligent and thoughtful women. \"For Men Only\" was written under the assumption that its audience is 'dudes' and 'bros', not intelligent or thoughtful men."}, {"userName": "Christel", "userReviewDate": "Apr 17, 2012", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/3276808-christel", "userReview": "I received some teasing from male friends when they found out I was reading this book, but I make no apologies!

Here's what I shared with one friend while reading \"For Men Only\":As I'm reading, since it's written from a male perspective to men, I'm gaining insight even though the book is about women.

And, I thought to myself that I totally fall into that category my husband can make me angry as hell (frankly, I'm angry with him right now...and, he's in the other room playing the guitar...probably, um, angry at me too!), but I love him, I also like him and I like him to know all of that. I do think that marriage is work, though, and I think that those who don't make it look like work are working at that, but it doesn't mean the work can't be fun!The StoryI wanted us to have something for Valentine's Day that we both could benefit from...don't get me wrong I wanted flowers and dinner too, but I wanted our presents to have meaning. I remembered a girl from work reading these books with her fiance and thought they would be a good idea for us.Some plusses*If your husband is like mine...you can still read this book all the way and he can use the Quick Start Guide which is included in the book and has 6 key components (Reassurance, Emotions, Security, Listening, Sex and Beauty) and where to find them throughout the book.*This book talks about the fact that the biggest problem with marriage is communication and then it shares ideas about how to fix this. I like that those ideas aren't incredibly secular, nor are they dirty.*If you buy the two books together (For Couples Only) they also come with this handy-dandy guide, which includes \"12 Tips to Get Great Results from For Couples Only\" my favorite being the one where you switch books (which is what we did, if you're wondering why I read this book clearly labeled for men) and answer the questions and mark it up et cetera and then you get to read your book with your partners comments.*It works for either marrieds or seriously thinking about getting marrieds.Some not so plusses*I'm just going to say this and hope that no one gets offended, because it is steeped in good Christian living, it can be a bit old-fashioned...ok, it can be a lot old fashioned. For instance, Chapter 7 is titled The Girl in the Mirror and is sub-titled \"What the little girl inside your woman is dying to hear from you--and how to guard your answer well.\" What does she want to hear? That her spouse finds her 'beautiful' and that her husband 'only has eyes for her'. Barf. And, while the chapter does end with some wonderful advice about the words 'fine' and 'no'...all I could keep thinking was I am not a pet.*I hear the For Women Only book is hokier...I wouldn't know because, well, my husband hasn't finished it yet!I really liked reading this book and marking it up. I liked learning what I feel makes a relationship and what I think makes it work and I like that my husband not gets to see what I think...that's so much easier than trying to talk about feelings. I'm not sure I'll feel the same way reading the next book with marks that aren't mine, but I will work at making that work.

The first time I read it, I had just started dating the woman who is now my wife, almost four years ago. At the time, I had also read \"For Women Only,\" the counterpart to this book, in an effort to offer notes and comments on it for my then-girlfriend's benefit.Now, I am somewhat distanced from that companion reading, and I can see some flaws in this book as a stand-alone product.Let me start off with the positives: It is an excellent book. It addresses an important need, and it offers research and statistics to do it. (Not being a researcher, I can't speak to the reliability of their research, but from what I do know, it's not so weak as to be discounted out of hand.) There are few other books in this same vein, although there are many which attempt to show men how women think; I have read even fewer which succeed even remotely.This book manages to accomplish that, because it's not afraid to quote from the horse's mouth, as they say. Instead of philosophizing, psychologizing, or otherwise intellectualizing, the Feldhahns work with real women with real opinions saying things that - for some reason - they can't just say to their husbands/boyfriends.That being the case, though, this book has some shortcomings. Almost all of these shortcomings fade, however, when this book is read in conjunction with its counterpart. When read alone, \"For Men Only\" is a pretty harsh condemnation of male behavior. Granted, some male behavior needs to change, but not all of it can be.For example, when discussing the female multi-tasking, multi-thinking mind, the Feldhahns spend a great deal of time discussing feminine emotions. At several points, male emotions come into play - but these are discarded as ignorant, irrelevant, or unimportant. In short, from the perspective of this book alone, men must cater to and coddle the emotions of their wives, but if they ever have an emotional response to something, it should be dropped like a hot potato.This sort of heavy-handed blame-game lurks throughout the book, and makes it upsetting, offensive, even unbearable to man forced to read it by itself. Only when you read both this book and its counterpart (which is pretty heavy-handed against women for their flaws) does everything fall into place as a mutual effort to improve the marriage and each other.So, a note to any women who want their man to read this book: don't take the titles literally, and make sure he reads the one for you, too.

It helped me identify a few areas I really need to work on and reinforce others where I had been able to improve over the recent past. Regardless of where one is at in a relationship, it is definitely a must read!"}, {"userName": "Will Lightfoot", "userReviewDate": "Mar 15, 2016", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/53423090-will-lightfoot", "userReview": "Really good book, I learned a lot. It's written a lot more towards married couples or couples in a committed relationship rather than for a single guy. But there are certainly tidbits that I picked up that I will be attempting to put into practice when the time comes. Highly recommend for all guys. You'll learn stuff.

Very interesting to hear about women from a man's perspective. Not a psychologist's perspective, but just a guy who's wife writes books. It was eye opening for me, and helped me understand myself better. It's a quick read, and definitely worth it."}, {"userName": "Cary Hatteberg", "userReviewDate": "Jul 07, 2011", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/3837306-cary-hatteberg", "userReview": "great explanation of the other genders perspective"}, {"userName": "Erin Bartos", "userReviewDate": "Mar 16, 2008", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/971383-erin-bartos", "userReview": "husbands: read this outloud with your wives if at all possible, so you can talk it out."}, {"userName": "Katie", "userReviewDate": "May 09, 2013", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/3812896-katie", "userReview": "Meh.

Read it!\" -Dennis Rainey, President, FamilyLife Story Behind the Book \"As I was writing For Women Only to help women understand the inner lives of men, over and over I heard that men wished there was a way to understand their wives, but they felt it was probably impossible. I heard from them, 'You are writing this little slim volume about men, but if it was about understanding women, it would have to be the size of an encyclopedia! Women are random and complicated!' These men were surprised and encouraged when I assured them that women are neither random nor complicated,", "title": "For Men Only, Revised and Updated Edition: A Straightforward Guide to the Inner Lives of Women", "url": "http://www.goodreads.com/book/show/15797972-for-men-only-revised-and-updated-edition", "average": 4.12, "cover": "https://images.gr-assets.com/books/1364250838l/15797972.jpg", "reviews": 338, "authors": [{"url": "https://www.goodreads.com/author/show/27604.Shaunti_Feldhahn", "name": "Shaunti Feldhahn"}], "type": ["Marriage", "Nonfiction", "Christian", "Relationships", "Self Help"], "outlinks": ["http://www.goodreads.com/book/show/15797972-for-men-only-revised-and-updated-edition", "http://www.goodreads.com/book/show/49149.For_Men_Only", "http://www.goodreads.com/book/show/6650634-for-men-only-revised-and-updated-edition", "http://www.goodreads.com/book/show/17414602-for-men-only-revised-and-updated-edition", "http://www.goodreads.com/book/show/15797975-for-women-only", "http://www.goodreads.com/book/show/344492.The_Veritas_Conflict", "http://www.goodreads.com/book/show/49160.For_Young_Women_Only", "http://www.goodreads.com/book/show/344493.The_Lights_of_Tenth_Street", "http://www.goodreads.com/book/show/1301037.For_Parents_Only", "http://www.goodreads.com/book/show/16498123-a-guide-to-the-present-moment", "http://www.goodreads.com/book/show/40198297-hunting-eichmann", "http://www.goodreads.com/book/show/40193094-the-breaks-of-the-game", "http://www.goodreads.com/book/show/5312677-celebration-of-discipline", "http://www.goodreads.com/book/show/40243434-soul-keeping", "http://www.goodreads.com/book/show/22561514-the-autobiography-of-eleanor-roosevelt", "http://www.goodreads.com/book/show/31391295-how-to-be-a-bawse", "http://www.goodreads.com/book/show/8143199-how-remarkable-women-lead", "http://www.goodreads.com/book/show/5440602-how-soccer-explains-the-world", "http://www.goodreads.com/book/show/40193421-dry", "http://www.goodreads.com/book/show/40204948-a-truck-full-of-money", "http://www.goodreads.com/book/show/40229444-animal-liberation", "http://www.goodreads.com/book/show/19485478-a-woman-in-charge", "http://www.goodreads.com/book/show/38272015-the-measure-of-a-man", "http://www.goodreads.com/book/show/40203910-32-yolks", "http://www.goodreads.com/book/show/40193675-recovery", "http://www.goodreads.com/book/show/18880380-enemies", "http://www.goodreads.com/book/show/36693639-victoria", "http://www.goodreads.com/book/show/40203983-being-nixon", "http://www.goodreads.com/book/show/20960501-100-days-of-real-food", "http://www.goodreads.com/book/show/40268935-barbarians-at-the-gate", "http://www.goodreads.com/book/show/26064021-things-no-one-will-tell-fat-girls", "http://www.goodreads.com/book/show/29465033-whipping-girl", "http://www.goodreads.com/book/show/19730030-a-history-of-warfare", "http://www.goodreads.com/book/show/22844509-best-friends", "http://www.goodreads.com/book/show/18939110-let-it-go", "http://www.goodreads.com/book/show/40192801-future-crimes", "http://www.goodreads.com/book/show/13576617-still", "http://www.goodreads.com/book/show/35525893-sick-in-the-head", "http://www.goodreads.com/book/show/40205119-paris-1919"]}
