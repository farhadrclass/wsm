In fact, the choices Roger Gale\u2019s three daughters make drive him quite crazy in this, the first ever Pulitzer Prize winner. He finds himself widowed and trying to understand and really get to know his three grown daughters. They are very different people, one a dedicated homemaker, one a passionate career woman/reformer, and the third a vacuous party girl who thinks more of money and position than anything else. During the course of the novel, he does forge an understanding of his family, and also a knowledge that their lives are their own and not his to manage anymore.One of the major themes addressed is whether we live on after death in another realm, or whether our living on is something we do through our children and their children. To live on solely through our progeny is a bit of a depressing idea for me. In truth, our memory only survives, on average, two generations. There is not a single person on the face of this earth who ever knew my great-grandmother, and while she lives on in me genetically, I do not find that that is enough. And what of those who die young or have no children? In the end, I think Roger Gale discovers that it isn\u2019t an either/or proposition, and I agree with that.While this book is a bit dated, it does open a door into the attitudes and thoughts of the middle class of the early 1900s. I found myself confronting a few stereotypes and misconceptions I have had about how men might have viewed their daughters in this time period. In the upper class, they were still items to be traded to keep money concentrated; in the poorer classes, they were drudges perhaps, enslaved to trying to keep families fed and afloat, but I found Roger\u2019s attitudes toward his daughters were very much in line with what someone of the 1950s middle class might have felt.I felt there was a bit of unnecessary repetition toward the end and that the novel could, in fact, have been wound up sooner than it was. However, that did not detract appreciably from the experience of reading it and I exited with something significant gained from the read. In my quest to read all the Pulitzer prize winners, I have discovered that this first winner was far from the least worthy."}, {"userName": "Richard", "userReviewDate": "Mar 01, 2015", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/7260883-richard", "userReview": "Given the history and prestige of the Pulitzer Prize, it bears remembering that the award for fiction got off to a somewhat shaky start. Established in 1917, the Pulitzer committee failed to award a prize for fiction/novel that year (a bad habit it can't seem to break even as recently as 2012), and the first true winner in this category, snagging the prize in 1918, was a work entitled His Family by Ernest Poole, a nice enough book but lacking in anything particularly outstanding or memorable to recommend it. Just whose family are we talking about here? That would be one Roger Gale, an early 20th century resident of NYC and a relatively well-to-do widower and father of three grown daughters. His Family follows the last few years of Roger's life and the changes that take place within \"his family\" as well as changes in the world at large that touch the lives of Roger and his daughters. At the outset, Poole makes little effort to develop the daughters beyond flat, almost-cliched character types. The oldest daughter, Edith, is the traditional mother raising 5 kids. The middle daughter Deborah is the do-gooder who is too busy saving the world (or in this case NYC's early 20th century immigrant caste) to be bothered with the mundane affairs of marriage or family. Laura, Roger's youngest daughter, is the self-absorbed social climber who increasingly flaunts her liberal (for her day) ideas. Roger, the dependable hub of the family wheel, watches with dismay as his daughters are flung further and further apart from him and from each other, tossed about by the inexorable and disquieting changes of the age. As crises of varying degrees present themselves, Roger attempts to reassure himself with the mantra of his late wife, \"you will live on in the lives of your children\". On the contrary, Roger gradually realizes (although he has probably suspected all along) that in the big picture, he exerts about as much influence over the affairs of his daughters as he does over the turbulent world outside the four walls of his home. He comes to terms with this at about the same time he learns that his physical life is surely ebbing away. Ironically, as his life draws to an end, he wields the most influence over his family when he happily relinquishes responsibility for their well-being.At the risk of reading something into the work that might not be there, I wonder if Poole unintentionally sheds light on an aspect of the sexism of that time, through one of the minor characters. If Roger finds any solace in the midst of the turmoil in his home, he finds it in a young man who is not part of \"his family\", the cripple Johnny Geer. In spite of his physical limitations, Johnny is everything that Roger's daughters are not: content with his life, devoid of drama, and just plain helpful to Roger. Johnny was like the son that Roger never had, and in the writing of his character, I thought Poole was making this subtle point: daughters and their affairs will drain you in a way that sons won't. This message is also reinforced, to a lesser degree, through Roger's interactions with his grandson George. Again, I may be unfairly assigning this particular intent to Poole's writing, but I find it curious that Roger's family is made up entirely of three very different daughters, each of whom manage to consume their father with more than their fair share of angst.From the perspective of nearly 100 years later, it's easy to dismiss the first Pulitzer fiction winner as mostly forgettable. Enduring or not, the selection of any title for the Pulitzer is a history lesson in itself and therefore valuable beyond simply being an entry in the Pulitzer ledger. I suspect that the selection of Poole's book was a reflection of some of the anxieties of the age, if not Poole's own. Women's Suffrage would finally be realized in a few years, and women were no longer resigned to merely fill Edith's role, as noble and important as it was. Men, especially fathers, weren't quite so sure what to make of it all, and we've been losing sleep over our daughters ever since."}, {"userName": "Elizabeth A.G.", "userReviewDate": "May 10, 2018", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/67736000-elizabeth-a-g", "userReview": "As the 1918 Pulitzer Prize for the Novel winner, \"His Family\" by Ernest Poole is a wonderful, quiet, engaging story of the Gayle family in early 20th century New York involving a widower father, Roger Gayle, and his three grown daughters, Edith, Deborah, and Laura. Family relationships; how unalike siblings can be; participation or lack thereof in the development and care of one's children; the experience of family members leaving the nest & creating their own lives; concerns with death and the legacy we leave our children -- (\"You will live on in our childrens' lives\" is a statement the deceased wife used to repeat and which Roger Gayle quotes several time in the story.) -- the rapid changes in society with the rapid growth of New York, the suffering of the poor living in the tenements, the effects of WWI on lives and the economy; and the expanding roles and careers of women outside of the family are all themes touched upon and make this story seem very relevant today. The book is beautifully written with good characterization. I found myself drawn into and caring about how their lives will turn out.

Roger, aging patriarch, is looking back on his life after the death of his wife. Only then does he get to know his adult daughters. Major themes which cross all generations are the uniqueness of each of his children, the tendency of parents to meddle in their lives and decisions (all for their own good, of course!), the idea (hope) that we parents will 'live on in them' even after we are gone, that our role may be to teach and model behavior for them but that they also teach US, that parents may have 'favorites' but that can change with the wind, that parents sometimes have feelings that are not acceptable...they don't really like their children all the time. Ordinary prose interspersed with exceptional passages often enough to keep interest...especially the descriptive and poignant ending.I find it interesting that only upon the death of his wife was he, the father, awakened to the lives of his children....it had been 'forced upon him' and it ultimately renewed his soul. Still true today, though I believe less so, is the distant father when it comes to interactions with the children."}, {"userName": "Molly", "userReviewDate": "Jul 21, 2017", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/16285686-molly", "userReview": "This is a gentle tale.

There are some recurring themes that make the reader think about his own vision, philosophy of life or just manner of behavior.The three daughters of \u201cHis Family\u201d have not just very different, but opposing mentalities and in the end-ways of life.-\tThe oldest is Edith who has as many children as possible \u2013 I guess they are about five, in any case too many from my perspective and even experience- I also have too many, even if covered with fur and feathers.-\tNext in line would be Laura, who does not want any babies and espouses the hedonic understanding of life- we are to enjoy the moment and not care about the rest-\tThe last is the prototype of the unselfish, saint like woman, who acts like Mother Theresa and instead of a smaller family of her own opts for a large one made of thousands of children The last but not least daughter is named Deborah and although she is the role model and her attitude is the most enviable and commendable one, I would say that I understand or empathize with her the least.That is because as a selfish person I do not see myself as giving away all the time that I read for others.It is also true that I had my own deceptions, when I got involved in the gated community that I live in, using my car, neglecting my family in the name of a higher, more important good of more people, only to get kicked and abused by the very guys I was planting trees, cleaning the streets, cutting the costs for.There is a misunderstanding that I share with those around Deborah though and that has to do with doing good things for others.Tal Ben Shahar who lectured at Harvard used to say that doing good to others is one of the most selfish things you can do- not in those words though.Doing good for others returns, sometimes manifold, and you increase your level of happiness after that.So the issue in the book is misplaced- Deborah\u2019s family feels that she sacrifices her happiness by caring for all those children- thousands of them.In fact, her happiness could very well be increased all in a virtuous circle whereby what she gives comes back and forth, with an always increasing wellbeing.Edith comes across as too involved with her own children to care for anything and anybody else, throwing out of the house a nice boy with a challenge is the word we use today, for what then called a handicap or crippling condition.Laura marries twice to the outrage of the conservative entourage, who had very different views on divorce and women\u2019s rights in 1914.That being said, it must be noted that Deborah is a woman of very advanced convictions, pleading and fighting for women\u2019s rights, to vote, to progress in what was called the feminist movement.There are some sad events, deaths and illnesses, but this is a book with an optimistic message I guess, for it feels like it encourages a variety of views, without really condemning one way of thinking and letting all flourish in the end, even if to various degrees.The hedonic philosophy has setbacks, but pulls through, as does the mother lioness, who takes her cubs to the country.The most prominent figure, Deborah has some tough choices of her own- would she marry and have children of her own, or dedicate her life, like a nun, to serving others and a higher cause for the good of humanity?This is a very good book."}, {"userName": "Spencer", "userReviewDate": "Feb 04, 2016", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/2706803-spencer", "userReview": "If you're looking for a good \"book group book\", His Family is a good choice. Set in 1913-1916 New York City, it tells the tale of Roger Gale, a 16 year widower, and his three daughters. Edith, 36, married with 4 children, and soon to be 5, has an insular view of her family. She focuses all her attention on maximizing the health, comfort and security of her family, at the expense of not experiencing the outside world. Deborah, 29, is single and a highly motivated principal of a large public school in NYC. Her students are largely from the burgeoning tenement class. She is a progressive suffragette, and a subscriber to modern educational theories. Her devotion to her vocation makes the possibility of a family very troublesome. Youngest daughter Laura, 26, is artistic, likes the theater, and is a modern, free and open-minded spirit. Unlike her deceased mother, father, and sisters, she is more aware and open about female sexuality. She marries into a relationship that her father can only call a m\u00e9nage.Roger swore on his wife Judith's deathbed to \"stay close to his family\", but he has not kept his promise. He is spiritually bankrupt, and no longer believes in a life after death. A severe financial jolt awakens him and he starts to see a spiritual re-growth. His spirits are uplifted by his youngest daughter, and his grandchildren. We see how his concept of family evolves with time and shifting circumstances. Not only the depth of familial relations are explored but also their breadth. He is troubled by the changes he sees taking place in the city because of the \"huddled masses\", the rise of tenements, and creeping socialism. He has been able to provide a comfortable upper middle class environment for his family through his self-created newspaper \"clipping service\". The start of the World War creates some sudden changes to the status quo that have some far-reaching consequences for his family.An on again, off again courtship relationship involving his daughter Deborah, consumes much of his waking moments. Dramatic changes in Edith's family status trouble Roger even more. Laura is not without marriage problems as well. Health concerns throw a monkey wrench into family functioning. Changing family financial status brings the family to the point of social and psychological collapse.The family explores hidden resources in order to survive. Roger's ring collection figures prominently and we learn its significance in his life. Assets that they had taken for granted for years are suddenly discovered and grant the family new hope. We see an evolution of the role of the family for Roger as he deals with maintaining the peace amongst the various family members, which becomes very challenging and body weakening. Roger is constantly reminded how Judith always said, \"We live through our children.\" Looking forward to my next book group discussion, I am optimistic that this will be one of our best discussions over the last 12 years."}, {"userName": "Johan Patrick Sy", "userReviewDate": "Jan 01, 2014", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/9809557-johan-patrick-sy", "userReview": "[ Okay!

Set in New York in 1914, Roger Gale is widower with three grown daughters, who each possess traits he sees in himself. As he emerges from the grief and depression of losing his wife, he turns to his daughters, remembering his wife\u2019s advice that \u201cyou will live on in our children\u2019s lives.\u201d He comes to learn that this not merely as a legacy once he himself is gone, but a way for him to flourish in his remaining days.Each of his daughters have families of their own, which symbolize the transitional era in which they live. Edith has a traditional family and can\u2019t look beyond her own children\u2019s well being. Deborah\u2019s \u201cfamily\u201d numbers in the thousands, as she is a school principal in the impoverished tenement neighborhoods and champions social reform. In this way she is the \u201cmodern woman\u201d, the opposite of Edith\u2019s old fashioned ways. And young Laura, who cares about nothing but her own pleasure, embraces the family she\u2019s found in the elite social circles of New York. Roger\u2019s changing opinion of his daughters through the course of the book is fascinating. The basic themes of evolving generations, the role of women in society, the moral responsibility of humans to one another and the transition of old fashioned living to the complexity of modern urban life are explored. Most of the drama plays out in Roger\u2019s home, where he raised his family, and where his daughters now occasionally live to cultivate their own. I would have liked more descriptions of urban New York and life in the 1910s, but having the home as the nucleus of the story is really the main point.

Forget about using the words \"stereotyping\" and \"misogyny\" and \"sexism\" and \"racism.\" Why? Because this isn't a 2017 author trying to write a 1917 book. This is a 1917 author writing a 1917 book. So you're not allowed to pretend you know how Poole should have written it, because you're not a 1917 author writing a 1917 book, or even a 1917 reader reading a 1917 book.2) Don't read the book. LISTEN TO THE FREE LIBRIVOX RECORDING BY JAMES CARSON. (https://librivox.org/his-family-by-er...) Carson isn't super animated, but I mean- neither is Roger (the book's main character). Carson's voice will have you saying \"Who is it that he sounds like??\" until you figure out that he has a timbre rather like Martin Sheen. Listening to Carson, you're enveloped in the story because it's so startlingly as if Roger himself were telling it to you.Now. The review.My favorite part of the writing was definitely Poole's character development. I recently read Grisham's penultimate offering, The Whistler, and just now I had to think hard about the title because the book was so desperately forgettable, and one of the maddening things was that halfway through Grisham would mention a main character and I still couldn't remember who the person was. Not in His Family. Almost instantly Poole could drop the name of anyone in Roger's family and I knew exactly who it was and felt the personality of the person, that's how good the character development was. I'm not sure when is the last time I read a book that helped me know the characters by name and personality so very, very quickly.Another feature that stunned me: I often think our world has gone mad, with infighting on every side over issues like women's rights, immigration, country vs. city, senseless war across the sea, economic changes, poverty and education, motherhood vs. career woman, marriage, children vs. childless \"freedom,\" etc. This book encouraged me, in a way, that this new age isn't the end of all things, it's not the only time we've ever struggled with these issues. Truly, I often felt like I was reading a 2017 blog post written in 1917 prose. And the most amazing thing is that it's a 1917 author doing it. He couldn't see suffrage 3 years ahead. He couldn't even see the U.S. entrance into WW1 much less the carnage that would follow in Round 2. (The publication date is 1 month after the U.S. entrance into the war, so his writing must have been finished.)I'll be thinking about this book for a long time, especially the perspective on death, how at the end, everyone feels their life isn't quite finished, and how our influence lives on in those we live behind. The description of Roger's death at the end was encompassing.Go. Listen to it now."}, {"userName": "Elizabeth", "userReviewDate": "Feb 07, 2018", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/25997042-elizabeth", "userReview": "Where do I begin? As expected, this book starts off slowly. I\u2019m grateful I kept reading though. About a quarter of the way in, His Family really took off as I became invested in the characters. I\u2019m glad I did not stop reading and took the time to adjust to the writing style and some of the early 20th century mindsets that affected the narration. First published in 1917, His Family was the first winner of the Pulitzer Prize for Fiction. It tells the story of widower Roger Gale as he goes about his family life while also maintaining a business to ensure family finances are in order. Each of his three daughters has a unique personality and their lifestyles are conflicting. The introspective Mr. Gale tries to remain an engaged father as his wife would have wanted while balancing the distinct relationships he has with each of his daughters. In the end, His Family is a remarkable tale of an aging man looking back on his life, welcoming the expansion of his family, and grappling with the reality of what it means to depart from his children\u2019s lives.At first, the interactions in this book came across as unemotional to me. However, the deeper I got into the book and more familiar I became with Poole\u2019s writing style, the interactions began to read as deeply emotional. I also found the numerous social commentaries (e.g. schools vs jails) fascinating and still relevant. I mean, look at this quote: \u201c\u2026to run a school where every child shall sit with a rat in its lap or a goat, and do just what he pleases, follows his natural bent, she says.\u201d Additionally, the running commentary on bustling New York City and how it parallels each person\u2019s ever-changing and turbulent life was fascinating.His Family is an introspective novel. One that made me contemplate life and appreciate family.\u201cAnd drowsily he told himself he must make a real effort, and make it soon, to know his family.\u201d"}, {"userName": "Kelly ...", "userReviewDate": "Apr 23, 2018", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/1330063-kelly", "userReview": "His Family is a quiet and nuanced novel about the life of one man and his family living in the early 1900s in New York. In many ways it is similar to Edith Wharton's The Age of Innocence which will win the prize a couple of years later. But while the latter book explores the elite of society, this one is much more about the interactions of family members. It looks closely at the ways siblings treat one another and how differently they each can see the world. It is, most of all, a book about a father's love. Roger is always finding himself between his three daughters. They each confide in, and complain to, him. He is constantly hearing the daughters whinge about one another. At times I am sure he must feel like telling them all to go away and stop whining, but he doesn't do so. He acts always as a sounding board and more. He is steadfast. As a mother I found myself admiring him.If you want to read a book that is heavy on plot, intricate and complex, you should skip this one. But if you enjoy a simple story of family dynamics and love, then you will like this one. I found it quite good."}, {"userName": "Kathy Mccuddy washburn", "userReviewDate": "May 04, 2017", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/14454371-kathy-mccuddy-washburn", "userReview": "Oldest daughter Edith, mother of 5, her children attend the best schools in New York City, has \"old fashioned\" standards and views of the world.
