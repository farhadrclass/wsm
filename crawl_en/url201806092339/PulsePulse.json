Knapp from beginning to end in one sitting. There is something about Eloise\u2019s writing that just sucks you in. I had stuff to do, which I should have done, but I didn\u2019t because I got so wrapped up in the story. It\u2019s addicting. It\u2019s an apocalypse story, which is what she specializes in, that starts with bad fish. I had a similar story in my own life with bad crabs (not those kind of crabs, you pervert, blue crabs from Maryland). My wife and I were on a dock trying to catch them and suddenly all these dead crabs began to float to the surface. We abandoned our catch and fled the dock. No way was I eating any crab that we caught when hundreds of others were going belly up to the surface. Anyway, in PULSE, bad fish starts the whole shebang. I was reminded of this story in my own life. But back to the novel. The bad fish starts it, with a parasitic worm. The characters Dom and Chelsea are on the run, trying to find a way to survive. My favorite thing about this novel is that there are chapters related to the people that don\u2019t survive, usually titled \u201cThe Infected\u201d. You meet the character, realize they are infected, and then sit back and watch what happens to them. Sometimes it\u2019s sad. These are interspersed between the main characters, who are watching the world fall apart around them.Knapp has a way of capturing the small things that happen in apocalyptic scenarios, and I love that. The people that know what\u2019s happening and ignore it, thinking it will work itself out. The people that are violent in regular life that basically have a free pass to do what they want because laws are suspended. The people in charge, who are trying to solve it before apocalypse scenario, or working to their own advantage. Seems these people are always late to the party, scrambling to figure it all out after it happens. She seems to capture all the aspects of human nature in crisis.I don\u2019t want to say too much more and be a spoiler. What I will say is that if you like apocalypse stories, but are tired of the same old same old, then give PULSE a try. It\u2019s a fresh take on the whole scene. Eloise Knapp is slowly but surely becoming the Master of zombie stories and end game scenarios. If you have read her Undead Situation and Undead Haze novels, you know what I am talking about (and if you haven\u2019t, you should). Give PULSE a try. You will be hooked till the end and won\u2019t be disappointed. I highly recommend this book. 5 Stars."}, {"userName": "AudioBookReviewer", "userReviewDate": "Jun 03, 2014", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/7365795-audiobookreviewer", "userReview": "ABR's full Pulse audiobook review can be found at Audiobook Reviewer.First thoughts about the cover of Pulse? A contamination symbol over a city? Hmm\u2026 Outbreak story! YES! What sort of cataclysmic event will unfold in this story..? I felt chills chase up and down my arms at the prospect of delving into such a story.This story starts with bad sickly fish. Yes, fish. Makes me afraid of sea food. I love the idea of this. It brings the idea of something this horrible being possible. The main character is Dom. Dom is your typical male. Silly, sweet, funny, heels over head in love with his girlfriend\u2026 There are several stories going on at once, but they all tie in together eventually. One of the other characters to watch/listen is Adam. Adam is a CDC scientist trying to figure out a cure for this infection.She stunk of sour milk and dumpsters. That line made my nose snarl up and my stomach clinch. I like that the \u2018zombies\u2019 could do rambling crazy talking. This gave the story just that much more horror to it. The end of chapter six was both horrible and awesome. I loved how the crazy zombie lady filleted someone alive.These \u2018zombies\u2019 are infected with a parasite rather than a virus. The parasite they have affects the brain. More or less making them completely base instinct, no moral compass bonkers. It reminds me of the movie The Crazies.What makes this a good book to read/listen to is the fact that it makes this seem simi-plausible. The \u2018What if\u2019 lingers. With strange things happening in the world today, the \u2018What if\u2019s\u2019 are all to real. It brings to mind of outbreaks like Ebola, the Flu, Encephalitis. Ironically it mentions a general link to Ebola in chapter seventeen or eighteen.There seems to be one error about a smart phone and gun in chapters thirty-six and thirty-seven. This is an author error and not a narrator error. It says in chapter thirty-six that the military took Dom\u2019s cell and gun. In chapter thirty-seven he has his cell again. Also, in chapter thirty-six they took Dom\u2019s gun, but in thirty-seven Chelsie has a gun. Why would the military take Dom\u2019s gun and leave Chelsie with her\u2019s?Over all I enjoyed this story. It had a new twist to the \u2018zombie\u2019 vibe. I liked that. The narrator is Michael Bower. He has a nice voice. Sharp, crisp, and edgy at the right times. Perfect for a story like this. The book is 4 hours, 55 minutes, and 38 seconds long. The author is Eloise J. Knapp.Warning - If you have a weak stomach, this book is not for you. There are lots of blood, guts, and horror, exploding stomachs, torture, and creepy parasites that will haunt your dreams.This book left me with the feeling that things can change quickly. Sometimes things are completely out of our control. The best we can do is to keep ourselves safe. Try to keep those we love safe. And try to avoid those that would drag us down into their madness.Audiobook provided for review by the narrator."}, {"userName": "Kenny Soward", "userReviewDate": "Mar 02, 2015", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/6532142-kenny-soward", "userReview": "This one started out pretty cool. The premise was nifty even though the characters weren't too deep. Honestly, I believe the author intended it that way; she wanted to write a fast-paced, violent, and disturbing narrative, and there might not have been as much room for character development as some people would have liked. At around 70%, the plot really came together and burst (quite literally) to the end. I like where this is going and will be starting Pulse II as soon as I can."}, {"userName": "Erin", "userReviewDate": "Feb 15, 2014", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/10901649-erin", "userReview": "Thanks for the nightmares...Thanks for the nightmares...Well written and seriously disturbing.

YES, PLEASE! This is exactly what Ms. Eloise J Knapp has provided her readers with in her latest release entitled Pulse. In Pulse, we read about a new threat to the world by seeing the point of view from a few various characters in different sections of the country. A parasitic infection comes out of nowhere and causing mass upheaval, yes because it strikes fast and strikes hard, but also because it's not easy to tell who is infected and who is not...until it's too late. As I mentioned, we learn about the infection and the happenings of the world from a few different groups of people. Dom and his girlfriend grab some supplies and hole up in their apartment building in Seattle and watch the happenings from their cell/computer screens and out their windows. We, also, see what is happening from the eyes of Dr Adam Baker and his staff who are on hand trying to figure out what is causing this outbreak and how to stop it. Along the way we meet a few others and learn of their struggles with this disaster and ultimately what happens to them. The infected in Pulse are quite unlike any I have read before. They begin by acting a bit off, then \"off\" turns to crazy and cannibalistic in some cases while others seem to have a bit of rational thinking where they attempt to maintain their appearance of humanity so that they can spread the infection from within. I am a bit unclear as to if the infection kills it's hosts and they are walking, talking corpses or if they are still alive and just being manipulated by the parasites. This question may have been answered in the book and I just may have missed it. Pulse is a great story that is definitely worthy of a read. It is very gruesome, disgusting and quite violent. I will warn that if you absolutely cannot abide even a remote hint of rape, do look elsewhere as, while there is no great detailed rape scene, there are definitely situations that happen and discussions had that may cause upset in a reader who is sensitive to this type of situation. Otherwise, you absolutely must give Eloise J Knapp's Pulse a read!"}, {"userName": "Sarah", "userReviewDate": "Mar 15, 2014", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/7932728-sarah", "userReview": "This is the first book I have read by the author but it won't be the last. As a huge post-apocalyptic fan I have read many books in the 'undead/zombie' genre. This was different, a parasite causing violent insanity as opposed to zombies. The originality of the worms spreading infection by bursting from their host was great, and the added danger of shooting the infected meaning an increased risk of infection meant the situation seems more dire than a run of the mill undead novel. It wasn't perfect, more character depth, especially for Dom and Chelsea wouldn't have gone amiss, but on the whole I really enjoyed it! And it was actually edited well, unlike a lot of self published authors, I didn't feel like I was reading a college essay full of grammatical and spelling mistakes which was a refreshing change!"}, {"userName": "Shawn Camp", "userReviewDate": "Feb 15, 2014", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/4958504-shawn-camp", "userReview": "A little disappointed in the latest novel from Eloise J Knapp. Her undead novel's have one of my favorite characters in them (Sinclair) and I look forward to anything she's got in the works. The problem with this is that there's a lack of creativity in the plot and it just rattles off as a disturbing dream, which upon the authors note that's exactly what it was. The characters are basically uninteresting and the it seems the violence and gore take over as the main focus of the story.Still it reads quickly and the first quarter of the book was interesting enough to push forward and finish it."}, {"userName": "Passion1kiss", "userReviewDate": "Apr 09, 2014", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/30404546-passion1kiss", "userReview": "The book talks about an unidentified illness (virus?) that begins spreading in North Dakota sending people in a panic. Those infected show flu like symptoms while losing their minds, and massacring each other in disturbing/sadistic ways. Though you would think it was a zombie apocalypse outbreak, it is something else. A unique twist in the story. The book reminds me of the movie The Faculty with a zombie edge. This story is relatively short, but overall a good read."}, {"userName": "Andy Parkes", "userReviewDate": "Mar 24, 2015", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/4930400-andy-parkes", "userReview": "I'll think twice before eating fish again...Gripping and disturbing in equal measure! The books follows several characters as the world is over run by \"zombie like\" infected people. I don't think it's \"spoilery\" to say there is no happy ending and some parts are pretty graphic.If you're into zombie/end of world, horror/thrillers then you'll enjoy this.

In this work the zombies are a bit different and remind me a bit of the Strain with worms infecting people. They also seem to be intelligent.
