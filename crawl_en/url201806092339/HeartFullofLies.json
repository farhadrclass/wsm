As the story of Liysa Northon, currently in prison for killing her husband Chris, is widely available, I'm not going to spend any time summarizing it. I have read some reviews that state that the language and context in this book is repetitive. While in one sense that is true, the list of people involved in this story is massive -- there are several pages in the beginning of this book listing the names of all of the people involved in this tragic tale.When I saw the long list, I wondered I might have trouble following the story, but I did not. I found it to be an easy and quick read, though naturally, disturbing. I think Rule was intentionally a bit repetitive at times just to keep the reader from getting lost. Maybe it's because she is so skilled as a true crime writer that she repeated names/situations more than necessary. It didn't bother me but I can see why some people would make mention of it.At any rate, I have great respect for this author. I will definitely read more of her work in the future."}, {"userName": "\u2665 Marlene\u2665 ", "userReviewDate": "Jun 01, 2013", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/1041370-marlene", "userReview": "While I was looking for this book on my shelf because this was the one where I noticed how biased Ann Rule started to write and I use it a lot as an example,I discovered I had forgotten to register it on Goodreads.Checked bookcrossing where I am not active anymore and bingo.Here is what I wrote about this book back then.Journal Entry 4 by CrazyDutchwoman from Heemstede, Noord-Holland Netherlands on Wednesday, January 12, 2005Hi,I am at around page 80. It was a nice surprise for me to see it weren't a lot of stories but just one story.I prefer those. I agree that her stories are very good, although I read A Rage to kill (short stories) and did not like that one at all.Anyway this one seems like a good one. Curious what is going to happen.I will update this journal while reading.take careUpdate January 18 2005Finished reading this morning. In between I had to read another book so it took me longer then I,d normally would)I do not know what it is Ann Rule is one of the authors, that got me hooked to the True Crime genre but I think her older books are much better written or it is me?Her writing in this book started to annoy me. Every thing Chris did was good . I do not understand stuff. Lyisa told everybody he hit her. I do not believe he did not know that. He was once confronted about it, well if it was me and I would constantly hear my wife told everybody I hit her, I would definitely take action.Plus I think I had trouble reading this book because I hated that she got away with so many stuff. She always got her way, the houses ,the kids with Nick. It made me so angry.I am glad she is in jail.Still have questions after reading it. I think it is a depressing book. It is good do not get me wrong but maybe I was not in the right mood while reading?"}, {"userName": "Jackie", "userReviewDate": "Jan 02, 2009", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/885351-jackie", "userReview": "This is Ann Rule's account of Liysa Northon's murder of her airline pilot husband. I became interested in her story after reading that Liysa sued Ann Rule for defamation over the book. According to the article I read, the court basically decided that the reputation of an inmate convicted of murder is so bad that it is impossible to damage it (I haven't read the opinion myself). After finishing the book, I was pretty convinced that Liysa was a nut, but I became absolutely convinced after reading the web page on which she describes how Rule has ruined her life. A taste: \"Although presented as a true story, the novel in fact is half truth and more creative fantasy to make it a 'better' story. The semi-fictional character in the book has hijacked Liysa's life, and this website is an effort to set the story straight.\""}, {"userName": "Sheri", "userReviewDate": "Oct 23, 2010", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/1909602-sheri", "userReview": "Heart Full Of Lies (Ann Rule)True crime.

I have to say, however, that this is not one of her best and I don't know if it is because the story doesn't have a lot of substance or that the author was having a bad day. It just doesn't quite measure up to some of her other best sellers.A popular commercial pilot is found dead while on a camping trip.....shot through the head while in his sleeping bag. He was accompanied by his wife Liysa and their son but they are no where to be found. Eventually, Liysa turns up 200 miles away at the home of one of her best friends, soaking wet and distraught. Thus begins an investigation, not only into the murder but also into the mind of a very disturbed young woman. It tends to get very repetitive as friends of Liysa sing her praises while others reveal rather unsettling facts about her. Maybe if the book was shorter, I might have given it a higher rating but it still was a fairly interesting read."}, {"userName": " PuMbA's MoMmy*\u2022.\u2665.\u2022* ", "userReviewDate": "Mar 14, 2014", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/4756353-pumba-s-mommy", "userReview": "Very sad.....This is the very first time that Ann Rule came across as judgmental to me.

Before she commit this crime she spent a couple of years setting the scene claiming he was a drug addict, an alcoholic and a brutal abuser.

Talk about whiplash! Although this is my first Ann Rule book, I did know that I was embarking on something completely different than Cormac McCarthy. Like Cormac, Ann Rule took me into the lives of a strange assortment of people but with Ann it was like a voyeuristic vacation whereas Cormac\u2019s scenery and characters were more like Apocalypse Now. I needed a break from books that require brain power to something more obvious. And Heart Full of Lies filled that need. When GR BookSwap announced it was going out of business, I went on a book orgy and requested dozens of books, many by authors I had never read. Ann Rule\u2019s true crime was one of those experiments. I also have Rule\u2019s Dead by Sunset on my shelf (another BookSwap roulette title) so I will wait to read that before I jump to any firm conclusions about her writing. I have watched snippets of reality police shows on cable TV. This book reminded me of those except the faces were not blurred out. I want to be a snob and say I am above that kind of entertainment but I think that, given the opportunity, I might be watching Law and Order more often. Now I am embarrassed!I will say a few things about \u201ctrue crime\u201d stories in this review. If you know much about them yourself, you may see that I know only a very little about soap opera drama, Law and Order TV shows or even \u201ctrue crime\u201d stories. So it may seem inappropriate for me to speak of any of these things. But I do know that this story begins with the crime and investigation and then concludes with the court trial. That seems familiar. It has what might seem like some wildly improbable characters in highly unlikely situations. And I will have to think about how truth and artistic license cohabit the same territory. A book can be like a TV dramatic presentation or soap opera in its use of what is called artistic license. Artistic license is when a creator presents inaccurate information intentionally to assist in the presentation of a story or experience. What is the appropriate role of this technique in \u201ctrue crime\u201d books?Two of the top ten stories on the GR true crime stories poll are by Ann Rule so we can stipulate that the author of this book is good at what she does according to GR people. She feeds us information tidbits by the bushel with so many characters that there is a line-up of several pages at the beginning of the book with all of their names and roles. There is some repetition for those of us with short memories or less than diligent editors. It is complete with conclusions about how the details add up. Knowing the conclusion does not eliminate suspense.The information tidbits include detailed character development facets spread throughout the book so we can imagine that we can get inside the minds of the main characters. Heart Full of Lies is an opportunity to educate readers about domestic violence. The defense attorneys decide that our villain does not meet the test for that syndrome, leaving us uncertain what aspects of her character succeed or fail to meet that standard. We hear lots of opinions about Liysa\u2019s bruises and behavior without factual confirmation. We did not hear much about Chris Northon\u2019s previous girlfriends to see if they had had any abusive relationship experience with him. Feelings sometimes substituted for facts: They both had a gut feeling that something wasn\u2019t right in Liysa Northon\u2019s statements about spousal abuse. It didn\u2019t matter how many women stood behind Liysa Northon, something was \u2013 in police parlance \u2013 \u201chinky.\u201d We are told that a defense attorney did significant research about spousal abuse: Birmingham consulted with a dozen experts on the \u201cbattered woman syndrome,\u201d and read as many research papers on the problem that has become so pervasive in America. He found that few women had actually been acquitted with this defense, although some had their murder charges reduced to manslaughter.  But the reader was never told \u201cHere are the facts\u201d and in the end I was dissatisfied with the effort to teach about this form of abuse.I give this, my first true crime book, two stars. That means \u201cIt was OK.\u201d I am doubtful that this genre and Rule\u2019s style of writing will capture my brains or my emotions satisfactorily. At some point I will try another \u201ctrue crime\u201d book to see if I can confirm my doubt. This book served me fairly well as an escape from serious reading but I think it turns out that I wanted more than just escape."}, {"userName": "Lisa", "userReviewDate": "Oct 12, 2017", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/5937779-lisa", "userReview": "Where do I begin? This is the tragic story of what could happen when you marry a crazy woman. This woman was so guilty it wasn't even funny.

If you choose to write about a complex case, then have enough respect for the intelligence and analytical thinking skills of your readers to represent it as such. We are savvy enough to understand that even if both individuals are terrible people, it's not ok to kill someone, even if they have been cruel to you. Your message to the reader should have been more in line with that message and less in line with leading the reader in a predictable, sensational, and forcible manner. I much prefer authors who understand I have a working brain and do not constantly try to tell me what to think. Half the time I wanted to yell, \"Shut up!,\" but the other half, I was so addicted to the story, I wanted to yell, \"Tell me more!\"Ann Rule reminds me of Jerry Bledsoe. They both add page after page of completely unnecessary judgement and commentary aimed at constructing an angel- devil dichotomy. Bledsoe: \"She is such a harlot, she actually wanted a new washer and dryer!\" Predicted reader response: \"Wow, so selfish of her to want a new washer and dryer, she must really be a murderer!\" Ann Rule: \"She refused to do housework but her husband tolerated it.\" Predicted reader response: \"Wow, she is a terrible person and took advantage of him!\" (Because I am sure he doesn't know how to clean up after himself or his child). There are better crime writers out there. I know because I have read them. Yet, Ann Rule is one of the most popular crime writers. What does that say about what the public wants? She, and I guess her readers, seem more interested in right and wrong dichotomies than analyzing the complexities of human nature. It's almost as if this need for punishment or the need for simplicity is so strong, it turns off skeptical parts of the brain. I wish Josh Greene would study why this might be. He loves studying the parts of the brain that compete with each other in order to come up with one single moral decision. I wish he could isolate the parts of the brain that want to simplify and construct dichotomies and the parts that are more comfortable with ambiguity and want to analyze the intricacies of those ambiguities."}, {"userName": "Beverly Meehan", "userReviewDate": "Nov 30, 2008", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/1392836-beverly-meehan", "userReview": "I usually find Ann's books a bit haunting as I live here in the northwest and most are set nearby.

However, most juries, defense attorneys, media, even personal friends and family are never able to piece together such a complete picture of the murderer. People like Liysa interact or intersect w/ us and we never know their real intent.

It was a book I read in about two days, as the writing style and the horrific story of Dianne Downs totally sucked me in. I went on an on and off Ann Rule journey after that, reading a number of her books. THE STRANGER BESIDE ME is still probably my favorite true crime book out there. But I took a break for a long while, until I just had a hankering to read her again. I decided to go with HEART FULL OF LIES, one of her later books about a woman who shot her husband while on a camping trip. She said that it was in self defense, that he had been violent and abusive towards her for years. But of course, if Ann Rule is writing about it, it's probably not as simple as all that.Liysa and Christ Northon and her husband Chris seemed to have the perfect life. Well liked by their friends and splitting their time between Hawaii and Oregon, they were well liked by everyone around them. But then Chris is found dead in a sleeping bag, shot in the head, and Liysa says that he was trying to kill her in a drunken rage, and had been abusing her for years. But as inconsistencies in her story and some glaring evidence comes to light, Liysa ends up on trial for his death. Was it an abused spouse fighting back and protecting herself and her children? Or was it a woman who had grown tired of her husband and wanted him gone?This is a very touchy subject, of course, though Rule was never one to shy away from controversies. This one didn't take me in like SMALL SACRIFICES or THE STRANGER BESIDE ME, but it was still an interesting read about a case I knew nothing about. Rule seems to be pretty sure that Liysa wasn't a battered wife, and finds evidence of past relationships that went sour more on her end than the partners. I think it's hard to know. There is enough doubt on both sides that left me kind of feeling more sad than anything else. Because it's either that a battered wife was put away for protecting herself, or a perfectly okay guy was killed because his wife was sick of him, as she'd grown sick of her other lovers before, and she got a comparatively meager sentence. Both scenarios are pretty crappy. There are so many things in this book (and even beyond it's publication) that make me feel like Liysa IS a manipulative person, but that doesn't mean that she wasn't abused by Chris. So yeah, I don't know what I believe. Maybe I just like my Ann Rule books more clear cut. WE KNOW TED BUNDY DID IT, Y'ALL. HEART FULL OF LIES was a pretty standard true crime book, but for whatever reason it didn't connect with me as much as some of the others by Rule that I've read."}, {"userName": "Robear Bottomtooth", "userReviewDate": "Aug 19, 2017", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/23296919-robear-bottomtooth", "userReview": "***Audiobook Review*** True rating: 3.75/5 Narrator rating: 5/5This was a very interesting listen. From the start I was drawn in by the lies, fabrications and grandiose tales this woman created in her life told to those closest to her. It is scary to think that we share the world with people like Liysa Northon, she is probably much more dangerous than a \"typical\" serial killer even though to date she has only killed one person (that we know of). She uses her looks, intelligence and cunning to manipulate others to her will and get them to totally believe without question, any lie she utters from her mouth. It is even more disturbing that she plays the victim of domestic abuse when she is in fact the abuser. There are so many women who are true victims but have had doubt cast upon their claims of abuse due to people like Liysa who play as victims to gain sympathy and attention and also to lay the ground work to commit murder disguised as self-defense. This was an abridged version of the audio book, I can only imagine what was left out or should I say how many more of Liysa's lies were cut.

After reading this book, I am so appreciative that my friend made it out alive!I think there is a tendency these days to say that any woman who alleges abuse is a victim, and actions she takes are justifiable. The book does an excellent job of showing a woman who probably went to great trouble to set up her husband as an abuser, regardless of the facts. So much of her life was about manipulative lies that she was an expert at that. Still, the facts are clearly against her.

But few, including Chris, had seen Liysa's other side -- her controlling behavior and dark moods, her insatiable hunger for money and property. And no one anticipated the fatal outcome of a family camping trip in an Oregon forest. Liysa soon revealed herself as a victim of domestic abuse that culminated at the campsite, where she shot Chris in self-defense. But crime scene evidence led detectives to wonder if Liysa was a killer, not a victim. Her controversial trial stunned all who thought they knew her.
