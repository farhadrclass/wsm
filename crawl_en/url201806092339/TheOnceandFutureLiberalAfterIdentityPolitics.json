And it is easy to critique Lilla's glibly summarized history of the past 80 years of American politics. Still, this book is a fascinating read with some critical content to engage with, particularly for those with a liberal bent.--Lilla posits two great American \"dispensations\": one liberal \"Roosevelt Dispensation\" covering the New Deal up until the late 60s and declining into the 70s, and one conservative \"Reagan Dispensation\" that continues to mark the American moment. The former has the hallmarks of engaged citizenship -- Lilla harkens often back to the \"we\" of FDR and JFK -- while the latter pronounced a new orthodoxy focused on hyperindividualism, capitalism, and a dismantling of the state. While critics (notably Beverly Gage at NYT, who likely took a hatchet to this book) can easily point out the missed nuances in summarizing these two movements, Lilla effectively draws the contrast in a way that can be discussed over the dinner table. --The book deftly contrasts 60s era protest with today's \"Facebook slactivism.\" Essentially, Lilla argues that the 60s era was focused outside the self (\"Young people who were incensed by the denial of voting rights out there, the Vietnam War out there, nuclear proliferation out there, capitalism out there, colonialism out there\"), while today's generation is far more focused on self-discovery of the inner self, and trying to make the outside world reflect a self-referential orthodoxy of identity. Lilla also traces some of this shift in part due to the political education of liberal America moving from factory shop floors to America's (elite) universities. Lilla goes for style over substance here at times -- claiming liberals need more mayors and fewer marchers, for instance. I would have preferred a much more in-depth treatment of the topic of activism of past and present, but the topic hangs together with Lilla's overall theme: that liberals today have become too focused on narrow identity politics to be effective as a national party (to say nothing of state and local elections.)[An interesting aside: Lilla actually opens an interesting line of argument about Marxism, which he admires (at least narrowly) for lifting laborers, farmers, and the like out of their narrow concerns and into the \"we\" of class consciousness. He later posits that it may be progressives such as Bernie Sanders who are more likely to move liberals beyond the narrow concerns of identity groups. I wish he had developed this more, given there are fascinating implications for a new strong-left-of-center politics.]--Lilla is at his best when critiquing political romanticism, purity testing and \"atonement\", fractional in-fighting, and \"evangelism\" of the Left and reminding the reader of the only true goal: getting officials elected at all levels of government. The most forceful line of the entire book can be summarized thus: \"Identity liberalism has ceased being a political project and has morphed into an evangelical one. The difference is this: evangelism is about speaking truth to power. Politics is about seizing power to defend the truth.\" He goes further, even suggesting that in being in thrall to identity politics is merely the Left's version of Reaganism (I can surely imagine many liberal-leaning heads exploding at the thought.) It's a persuasive line of argument, albeit one that leaves Lilla open to criticism for not engaging the Right's own identity politics whatsoever. I'll take it that was not his aim for the book.--Lilla makes some pithy claims that, by nature of his position, needed more support than he granted in \"The Once and Future Liberal.\" Most seriously, he outright dismisses BLM as a productive social movement. I would think that a liberal scholar would at least critically analyze BLM, if not outright sympathize with its aims. While supportive of 60s era progressive causes (Civil Rights Movement, first/second wave feminism), he finds no identity-based causes useful today. Why? Is that really the case? I expected more here.--Lilla continues to seek the answer to identity based politics (and its failures) in common purposes, citizenship, and institutions (and perhaps more \"big tent\" politics.) This argument is persuasive and evocative, but Lilla is long on style and short on tactical solutions. How should Democratic candidates respond to identity-based social movements like BLM? How do liberals balance the needs of the vulnerable minority groups (e.g. transgender people) against the common \"we\" -- particularly when the conservative Right is actively legislating against those minority groups? How far should liberals go to not alienate white moderates when research is demonstrating more white Americans are seeing racial equality politics as a \"zero sum game?\" Again, Lilla is silent. If you are seeking a book that parenthetically explains how we got to the current political moment of Trump and fractional identity politics, particularly on the Left -- and are willing to objectively seek content amid writing that often comes off as a jeremiad against the Left -- this book accomplishes that. If you're a young liberal looking to get motivated to a bigger purpose, this book may either incense you or inspire you (or both). If you're a conservative worried about what Trump's America presages for America -- this book is also an interesting (if unintentional) orthogonal read about the Right. All in all, I came away from this book deep in thought and ready to seek political action outside myself -- which I think was Lilla's goal."}, {"userName": "Brad Lyerla", "userReviewDate": "Oct 18, 2017", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/4384303-brad-lyerla", "userReview": "THE ONCE AND FUTURE LIBERAL is a short polemic written for a politically liberal audience with the goal of reinvigorating the electoral prospects of the Democratic Party in the United States. ONCE AND FUTURE was written in response to Hillary Clinton's surprising loss last November. It is most decidedly not a book directed to a conservative audience. Yet, many of the reviews that one finds in GoodReads are from conservatives. Perhaps, even most of the reviews come from conservatives. This caused me to wonder that Lilla might be on to something to have stirred them up so. Now, after reading THE ONCE AND FUTURE LIBERAL, I conclude that, yes, he is on to something.ONCE AND FUTURE is very short. It is less of a book and more of a pamphlet, truth be told. I read it on an e-reader and it is less than 70 pages formatted for that medium. There is a limit to how much can be accomplished in such a short document, of course. Don\u2019t expect the erudition of Lilla\u2019s scholarly works. Don\u2019t expect exhaustive research or comprehensive treatment of what ails liberalism in America currently. Instead, Lilla offers an argument sketched so broadly that there is little point in examining it closely. His thoughts on what went wrong with the Democratic Party in the last 50 years are not the interesting part anyway. Plus, if you have read the dust cover of the book, you already know that Lilla blames identity politics for the current fortunes of the Democrats. He equates the Democrat\u2019s identity politics to the Republican\u2019s anti-government politics and concludes that they both have proven to be self-destructively individualistic and have left voters angry and grasping.In the last 15 pages of his book, Lilla gets down to business. He calls this a time for Democrats to \u201cReset\u201d. He exhorts Democrats to revive and re-commit to the concept of citizenship as a way of re-invigorating Democratic politics. He wants to persuade us that a re-examination of what citizenship means offers great potential for a new vision of what our future as a nation can be. Lilla offers four lessons for the resetting of the Democratic Party. First, he urges Democrats to give priority to institutional politics over movement politics. That is, work inside government to achieve liberal goals. The obvious corollary to this is to do what it takes to win more elections at every level of government.Second, he wants Democrats to give priority to democratic persuasion over self-expression. This seems a swipe at the latt\u00e8 elitism that infects liberal thinking from time to time. (In Chicago, where I live, we refer to this as the \u201clake front liberal\u201d problem.) The ancient Greeks referred to it as demophobia. But I could be misstating it. It\u2019s a concern that must be refined further.Third, Lilla urges that Democrats give priority to citizenship over group or personal identity. Lilla demonstrates that identity politics has done much to undermine the Democratic Party with swing voters and centrists. I am not qualified to speak for Democrats, but Lilla has persuaded me that identity politics (group or personal) must be minimized for the Democrats to reverse their fortunes. However, Lilla understands that some liberals correctly will see this as a challenge to their pet projects. So, he warns us to expect some howling.Finally, Lilla urges that we emphasize civic education. First create citizens, then convince them to be Democrats, he reasons.It is this final thought that appeals most strongly to someone like me. \u2018Let\u2019s make citizens\u2019 goes off in my head like the proverbial light bulb. Of course! Let's take Lilla at his word. Making citizens is not empty sloganeering. Lilla has me convinced that citizenship is the place to start. Let\u2019s have a national conversation about citizenship. Extremists and disruptors on both sides, with their reflexive negativity for our \u201cgoddam\u201d government and simpletons' rhetoric \u201cwho needs it?\u201d, will be at a disadvantage in that conversation. They might try to squash it. But that is all the more reason to make it happen. And we should thank Mark Lilla for starting us off."}, {"userName": "Jim Coughenour", "userReviewDate": "Aug 26, 2017", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/180643-jim-coughenour", "userReview": "My tepid rating has as much to do with my own weariness as with anything Lilla writes. At the most general level \u2013 and there's not much specific in this short book \u2013 I agree with Lilla's argument.What's extraordinary \u2013 and appalling \u2013 about the past four decades of our history is that our politics have been dominated by two ideologies that encourage and even celebrate the unmaking of citizens. On the right, an ideology that questions the existence of a common good and denies our obligation to help fellow citizens, through government action if necessary. On the left, an ideology institutionalized in colleges and universities that fetishizes our individual and group attachments, applauds self-absorption, and casts a shadow of suspicion over any invocation of a universal democratic we.In short: greedy bigots vs. sanctimonious idiots.I don\u2019t think either the right or the left has a monopoly on intolerance or self-absorption. I grew up in the conservative evangelical Midwest; I\u2019ve lived in San Francisco for the past 25 years. Lilla is a liberal, and as Christians used to say, \u201clet judgment begin in the house of God.\u201d His harshest words are for his own kind, although his criticism will only the wound the intentionally thin-skinned. Given the spirit of the moment, his focus is identity politics. Here\u2019s another capsule summary, with an echo of Ren\u00e9 Girard:What replaces argument, then, is taboo. At times our more privileged campuses can seem stuck in the world of archaic religion. Only those with an approved identity status are, like shamans, allowed to speak on certain matters. Particular groups \u2013 today the transgendered \u2013 are given temporary totemic significance. Scapegoats \u2013 today conservative political speakers \u2013 are duly designated and run off campus in a purging ritual. Propositions become pure or impure, not true or false.Shamans made me laugh out loud. I came out a few years before AIDS hit the gay community. Identity politics were more celebration than protest, and even protestors (often drag queens etc.) were alive to the sense of comedy inherent to all identities. I remember an ancient argument with my father, who was ranting about the Gay Agenda. You're right, I said, there is one \u2013 and it can be summed up in two words: \"equal rights.\" In the right contexts identity politics opens the door to everyone, celebrates diversity and inclusion. But it's not enough: the practical politics that guarantee protection for everyone require hard work, organizing at local and state levels, which admittedly isn't as much fun as cavorting around statues or pronouns. As Oscar observed, the problem with socialism is that it takes up too many evenings.As I write, a merry band of anti-white-supremacists are making their way down Market Street with all the carnival capers and mockery the supremacists deserve. But already these right vs left symbolic battles have exhausted their potency. Like Lilla, I'm still \"liberal\" enough to believe that everyone, on the coasts and in the heartland, religious and atheist, of all racial and gender blends, have more in common than not \u2013 and that we have a common enemy in the plutocracy that is dispossessing us all."}, {"userName": "Charles", "userReviewDate": "Aug 18, 2017", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/9628169-charles", "userReview": "Mark Lilla has been a bad, bad boy. He has dared to point out the feet of clay upon which stand King Liberal, and he, like Cassandra, will not be thanked. Still, this short book is an excellent political analysis, and it points the way, if only loosely, to a wholly new order of things, thus starting to answer my perennial question, \u201cWhat is next?\u201dLilla\u2019s project is to rescue modern liberalism from the dead-end sewer of identity politics. His purpose in doing so is, in part, simple intellectual coherency, but mostly it is an exercise in demanding that liberals focus on regaining actual power. The book\u2019s main flaw is that it is half a loaf\u2014it shows what is wrong with the Left\u2019s current program, but other than vague, aspirational calls for focusing on an undefined \u201ccitizenship,\u201d it does not explain what the new liberal program leading to real power should be, only what it shouldn\u2019t be. This is not nothing, but the argument needs its other half.Lilla begins by arguing that liberalism has lost America. He doesn\u2019t sugarcoat this conclusion. In fact, it\u2019s more like he shoves it down the throat of his readers, yelling \u201cTake your medicine!\u201d His analysis of where liberalism is today revolves around Lincoln\u2019s well-known mantra, \u201cPublic sentiment is everything.\u201d American public sentiment has moved rightward for decades, and thus \u201c[L]iberals have become America\u2019s ideological third party, lagging behind self-declared independents and conservatives, even among young voters and certain minority groups. We have been repudiated in no uncertain terms.\u201d Why this is, why the response of liberals so far has been exactly wrong, and what that response should instead be, are the subjects of \u201cThe Once and Future Liberal.\u201dNowhere does Lilla explain the derivation of his title. This would have been an informative exercise, because very few members of his target audience probably realize where it comes from. The title deliberately echoes T.H. White\u2019s 1958 novel, once famous, and now forgotten except by superannuated liberals, \u201cThe Once and Future King,\u201d which reimagined the King Arthur legend as political didacticism. To liberals of a certain age, I think (not being of that age, or liberal, I cannot be sure), White\u2019s book is wrapped up with the mendacious Camelot legend spun around John Kennedy after his assassination. It conjures up, for them, a golden time when the future was brilliant, they were young, and liberals were in control\u2014as it happens, also the time when their political redoubt, the \u201cRoosevelt Dispensation\u201d identified by Lilla, began crumbling. The end point of the Arthurian legend, of course, is that Arthur sleeps, in Avalon, whence he shall return. Lilla presumably means to evoke that liberalism will, or can, similarly return, having reclaimed Excalibur from the Lady of the Lake. (Given that Arthur\u2019s purpose in returning is to save Britain from the ravages of foreign conquerors, we can hope that across the water the actual Arthur will return any day now to kick the savages out of Londinium, and Rotherham.)Lilla\u2019s historical frame is that of two past dispensations, the liberal Roosevelt Dispensation (from the 1930s to the 1970s), and the conservative Reagan Dispensation, from 1980 until today, which is \u201cbeing brought to a close by an opportunistic, unprincipled populist\u201d (i.e., Trump). \u201cEach dispensation brought with it an inspiring image of America\u2019s destiny and a distinctive catechism of doctrines that set the terms of political debate.\u201d The Roosevelt Dispensation was focused on collective action with a positive gloss on government; the Reagan Dispensation on individualism, with a negative gloss on government. Each reflected the public sentiment of the time. And at the dawning of the Reagan Dispensation, instead of regrouping \u201cto develop a fresh political vision of the country\u2019s shared destiny,\u201d liberals lost themselves in the swamp of \u201cthe politics of identity, losing a sense of what we share a citizens and what binds us a nation.\u201dWhy, on an intellectual level, is focusing on individual identities a \u201cswamp\u201d? Because it feeds atomistic individualism, which is corrosive of community, which undercuts political power. Although Lilla seems to think that conservatives are all, and are all necessarily, cut-rate versions of Robert Nozick\u2019s pristine libertarianism, this is not true, and in many ways Lilla\u2019s core intellectual points are identical to those made in recent years by many conservatives. While he doesn\u2019t use precisely the same concepts or vocabulary, in this analysis Lilla sounds much the same notes as Robert Nisbet did in 1953\u2019s \u201cThe Quest for Community,\u201d or Ryszard Legutko did in last year\u2019s \u201cThe Demon in Democracy.\u201d Those books attack excessive individualism and its necessary result, the substitution of the state for community (and consequent state coercion to suppress any private denial of those rights). Lilla, very similarly, complains that liberals focus far too much on individual rights. \u201cAlmost all the ideas or beliefs or feelings that once muted the perennial American demand for individual autonomy have evaporated. Personal choice. Individual rights. Self-definition. We speak these words as if a wedding vow.\u201d In part, Lilla blames Reagan, but mostly he blames society and liberals for a turning away from communitarianism. But philosophically, this is a much deeper strand in Western thought than Lilla thinks. It did not begin in 1980; it is plausible that the spiral into atomistic individuality is the necessary, inevitable consequence of the Enlightenment itself. However, Lilla is not wrong about where liberalism is today.Whatever the intellectual origins of excessive individualism, which he also attributes to romanticism and New Left community organizers, Lilla is unsparing in his acidic treatment of modern Democrat idols and their focus. \u201cHope . . . in what? Yes we can! . . . do what?\u201d \u201c[Liberals] began to speak instead [of citizenship] of their personal identities in terms of the inner homunculus, a unique little thing composed of parts tinted by race, sex, and gender.\u201d Lilla attacks elevation of supposedly oppressed groups as treating them \u201clike shamans . . . . Particular groups\u2014today the transgendered\u2014are given temporary totemic significance.\u201d Excoriating argumentation that begins \u201cSpeaking as an X . . .\u201d, Lilla notes, \u201cOne never says, \u2018Speaking as a gay Asian, I feel incompetent to judge this matter.\u2019\u201d He viciously attacks Black Lives Matters as a group that only know how to \u201cuse Mau-Mau tactics to put down dissent\u201d (again, referring to the Mau-Mau dates him, but more importantly, in most circles this metaphor would be viewed as overtly racist, since the Mau-Mau were black Kenyan terrorists who killed mostly other black Kenyans). This is fun stuff for a conservative to read while imagining the reaction among liberals reading all this (pass the popcorn!). The reader (with pleasure, in my case) pictures Lilla grinding his teeth in rage and frustration, knowing that most of his audience is going to recoil, point an accusing finger at him, and shriek \u201cUnclean! Unclean!,\u201d just before the stones start to fly through the air\u2014but he still grimly forges on with his exposition, a secular Man of Sorrows.The author is spot on in his analysis of specifically how liberals got to the political box canyon they now find themselves in. Beginning in the 1970s, as the country turned away from the Roosevelt Dispensation, liberalism started to rely on a form of social individualism (different from Reaganite economic individualism), in part because it seemed politically powerful, and in part because of ideology\u2014because it was a form of religion, or what Lilla calls \u201cevangelicalism.\u201d This religious impulse, not practicality, is what Lilla defines as a key American characteristic. When they lacked the political power to accomplish these goals of liberation, instead of building that power, liberals instead turned to the courts to \u201ccircumvent the legislative process.\u201d Consensus was ignored in favor of judicial fiat, which reinforced (or more accurately, proved) \u201cthe right\u2019s claim that the judiciary was an imperial preserve of [liberal] educated elites.\u201d As a result, \u201cEven the slogans changed, from \u2018We shall overcome\u2019 \u2013 a call to action \u2013 to \u2018I\u2019m here, I\u2019m queer\u2019 \u2013 a call to nothing in particular.\u201d Liberals captured the universities\u2014but Lilla claims that avenue has been a dead end for liberals, since universities have become a massive navel-gazing enterprise alienated from public sentiment\u2014\u201ca pseudo-political theater for the staging of operas and melodramas.\u201dOf course, a necessary part of this basket of premises is that liberals don\u2019t have power, that they lost it in their descent to idiotarian identity politics. But that\u2019s at least partially false. Lilla says that the electorate has moved rightward, which is true, but he never acknowledges that during the Reagan Dispensation, on social and cultural matters, liberals have had an unbroken record of success in achieving their goals (except for gun control). Mostly, this has been done by controlling the courts (which Lilla bizarrely implies are controlled by conservatives), and which he elsewhere criticizes as inadequate to build real power. Maybe it is inadequate, but there certainly appears to be no chance of a rollback of liberal cultural victories, so democratic politics or not, nothing succeeds like success. Yes, electorally liberalism has \u201cbeen repudiated in no uncertain terms.\u201d Yes, public sentiment has moved rightward. But in terms of power, at least social and cultural power, liberalism has seized total control, imposing its will upon the electorate and an opposed public, and continues to hold its citadel against all comers.None of this undercuts Lilla\u2019s intellectual point\u2014that identity politics is a \u201cme too\u201d political philosophy, \u201cmesmerized by symbols,\u201d with both nothing to offer and a shattering effect on creating the political coalitions mostly necessary to actually gain power and achieve political ends. The result is a mass of individuals who are too hung up on the momentous importance of their own (mostly stupid and false) identitarian thoughts to even consider lasting coalitions with others to achieve broader political goals. Such a person \u201ccan hardly be expected to have an enduring political attachment to others, and certainly cannot be expected to hear the call of duty toward them.\u201d At some point, whether that point has arrived or not, this must erode liberal political power.One problem for Lilla\u2019s recommendations, though, with their pivot around recapturing \u201cpublic sentiment\u201d for liberalism, is that in Lincoln\u2019s time public sentiment was educated. Men and women stood all day in the blazing sun to wait for, and then to listen for hours to, the Lincoln-Douglas debates. Their \u201csentiment\u201d was well-informed and closely reasoned; anyone purporting to advocate public policy based on his feelings or his identity, or without being able to defend his position would have been laughed at and ignored. Yes, identity politics is irrational and the antithesis of reasoning, but it\u2019s only one example of the wholesale degradation of political thought in the modern world, and the our inability to demand coherent, precise thought from our leaders. And, as well, to recognize that there are leaders, and there are followers, and distinguishing the two is important. No doubt Lilla would be an excellent leader, and his thought is closely reasoned and coherent. But on the Left, he is very close to a minority of one, and the Right is not exactly outstripping the Left by much on this score. Thus, while \u201crecapturing public sentiment\u201d sounds noble and fine, the simple phrase elides that recapturing it requires the remaking of our entire system of political thought, a much less easy task.Some \u201cfactual\u201d portions of the book are just delusional. For example, Lilla claims the right dominates the approval of judicial nominations. That may be true during Republican presidencies; the opposite was true under Obama. And no matter who dominates judicial nominations, it\u2019s only Democrats who get the results they want from the judges they appoint\u2014as Lilla himself notes, in the context of pointing out liberal over-reliance on this as a method of achieving political goals. (Lilla also bizarrely implies that Republicans are to blame for making judicial nominations a partisan process; the name \u201cBork\u201d appears nowhere.) Other claims are less central but equally delusional. For example, Lilla relies heavily as an object lesson on the legend that Republicans, starting in the 1980s, developed a massive infrastructure to train conservative young people, \u201ca vast library of popular books and academic policy studies. They set up summer camps where college students could read Alexander Hamilton and Friedrich von Hayek, and learn to connect them.\u201d And so on, positing a massively funded enormous campaign with its tentacles everywhere. This is nearly totally mythical. I was myself heavily involved in this world in the mid- to late-1980s, and it was tiny (especially compared to the unbelievable resources and programs the Left had (and has), supported and buttressed by the universities, the press, and innumerable \u201cpublic interest\u201d groups). Such conservative activities (i.e., those not focused on retail politics) involved maybe a few hundred young people, nationwide, at a time, most of whom I knew personally. Yes, the Heritage Foundation was a useful source for conservative policy ideas, before it became a hack group, and yes, the Federalist Society has been extremely successful. But beyond those, I hate to break it to Lilla, this conservative ecosystem of the Reagan Dispensation that he holds up to liberals as an ideal is a chimera.In the end, though, the biggest flaw in the book is that the reader is never told what, exactly, is the political program of the \u201cfuture liberal\u201d? We are told that America needs to work to elect more liberals, with a new (liberal) political vision\u2014but then that we cannot \u201cshop for\u201d one, because, \u201cPolitical vision emerges of its own accord out of the timely encounter of a new social reality, ideas that capture this reality, and leaders capable of linking idea and reality in the public mind so that people feel the connection. . . . The advent of leaders blessed with that gift, like Roosevelt and JFK and Reagan, is as impossible to predict as the return of the Messiah. All we can do is prepare.\u201d Leaving aside the poker-game tell of the aging liberal, the ludicrous yet reflexive assertion that JFK was a visionary leader in the mold of Roosevelt or Reagan, I agree with this, and I have been pushing the need to prepare until the Man of Destiny arrives for some time now\u2014although the program I hope he pushes is pretty much the direct opposite of what Lilla hopes for. But regardless, this vague, aspirational, waiting-focused prescription isn\u2019t likely to tear away today\u2019s American liberals, caught in the pleasurable virtual reality of their own supreme self-importance, from their golden opium dream of Emancipatory Xanadu, into the cold light of compromise and building political bridges and power.This is a short book, so maybe Lilla is merely trying to stay focused, but the reader suspects the lack of specifics is because Lilla, like Wile E. Coyote, has taken his idea, sped off with it, and when he looked down, realized that he had nowhere to go, or nowhere good to go. My guess is that Lilla suffers from much the same problem as Joan Williams in \u201cWhite Working Class\u201d\u2014he doesn\u2019t actually believe in political compromise, but rather in projecting the appearance of it in order to gain power from rubes. Thus, the sole example he gives of actual political compromise, or says he gives, is abortion. He admits, apparently without shame, \u201cI am an absolutist on abortion. It is the social issue I most care about, and I believe it should be safe and legal virtually without condition on every square inch of American soil.\u201d But he recognizes that \u201cI should find a civil way to agree to disagree and make a few compromises in order to keep the liberal [voters] in my own party and voting with me on other issues.\u201d What compromises does he identify? Perhaps making partial-birth abortion illegal? Limiting abortions in the second trimester? Parental notification? Waiting periods? No. Rather, merely that Robert Casey should have been allowed to speak at the 1992 Democratic National Convention (a quarter century ago), to \u201cpresent a pro-life plank to the platform, even though he knew it would be defeated.\u201d The plank\u2019s certain defeat is something not to be challenged, of course\u2014rather, Lilla\u2019s only wish is that the lapdog should be allowed to jump up and down a few times, or even whimper a little, before being stuck in the corner. And pro-life women who were excluded from the 2017 anti-Trump march in Washington should have been allowed to march\u2014not, of course, to push being pro-life, but to be anti-Trump. These are not real compromises. It is obvious that Lilla would deny both Casey and pro-life women any platform if there was any chance their views would actually be listened to and implemented.What is more, Lilla never identifies any area, any area at all, where the radical individualism that stokes identity politics should be cut back\u2014either by government mandate, or by the choice of individuals to be more communitarian. Elsewhere, Lilla has said \u201cPolitics . . . is not about getting recognition for certain groups who have problems; it is about acquiring power to help them.\u201d But help them how? Modern liberals, as is the core of Lilla\u2019s complaint, universally describe that help as emancipating them from all limits, which implies that recognition of those groups as groups is the necessary precondition, and power\u2019s end is to remove any limits that exist for that group. Nowhere in any of this program is any reduction in individualism. Similarly, \u201cDemocratic citizenship implies reciprocal rights and duties. We have duties because we have rights; we enjoy rights because we do our duty.\u201d (This, of course, is a core belief of conservatives from Aristotle to Reagan, totally rejected for decades by the Left, so hearing it here is a bit jarring.) But what are those rights and duties? Again, Lilla never says. His only talk of duty conflates \u201cdoing something for your country\u201d with \u201cdoing something for your government,\u201d thus making the basic error of conflating country and government.

Most lefties will disagree with some of it-- a lot of us will disagree with a lot of it. Many of us will write it off based on a single poorly chosen word or phrase, like a fucking parody of the sort of easily offended Puritan liberal college-educated New Yorker Lilla criticizes all book long (I've already seen several people take umbrage with Lilla's use of the term \"mau-mauing\"... which might not have been a wise choice, on his part, but STILL, who cares... it's one phrase, gang). I have problems with Lilla's view, too. But the point of Lilla's book is that our problems with each other, as liberals, should not get in the way of crafting a vision for society that incorporates as many folks as possible under the umbrella of citizenship. Somewhere along the way, we alienated a lot of people in a lot of places. In Lilla's eyes, this doesn't mean Democratic ideals-- equality, racial justice, etc-- have lost their luster. It means that we've forgotten how to talk to people-- how to actually persuade people that our side is the one that cares, that our side is about bringing us all up, together.Most of the issues Lilla has with the modern left are rhetorical. We don't say \"we.\" We emphasize the labels of race and gender and sexuality and play down our commonalties as Americans. We insist on our moral superiority and look at other views not as political opinions, but as evidence of irredeemable barbarity. But Lilla also addresses-- and attacks-- the persistent interest of liberals in protest and \"movements\" at the expense of campaigning, forming alliances, voting, etc-- i.e. the hard work of politics that pays off in winning elections. As Lilla says, it's not that marches and parades and energy and making signs aren't important. It's that, minus liberal governments, those things can never really attend to people's needs. Until liberals have real political power, they can never inspire real social gains. Obtaining that power is gonna require changes from all of us. It does not mean running away from our beautiful multicultural coalition... And it definitely doesn't mean going outside and shooting a deer in the fucking head, or whatever hillbilly field trip you wanna go on.

He does capture what John Rawls was getting at with his Concept of an Overlapping Consensus.Trump is the apotheosis of Baby Boomer rule. Our consensus has always been that we would have great benefits (Social Security and Medicare) or ourselves and the elderly (protected by the Left), maintain a strong defense (bipartisan consensus), and not pay for it (tax increased blocked by the Right). The concomitant squeeze on discretionary spending has prevented any investment in the future (infrastructure, research, training, education, etc. -- after all, how would it benefit us during our entitled lives?) or any succoring to those left behind by (mostly) technology and (somewhat) globalization.Trump's ascendance is a direct consequence of that: he listened to those we ignored.

Mark Lilla argues that activist liberalism's obsession with identity (women, black, LGBTQ, etc...) has handicapped and hindered the Democrats' ability to offer a broad-range vision of the common good for Americans. Lilla uses religious vocabulary, speaking of the \"Roosevelt Dispensation\" that stretched from the 1930s-1960s and that focused on New Deal initiatives that bound Americans together, followed by the \"Reagan Dispensation\" that promoted rugged self-reliance and a libertarian attitude that has now exhausted itself. America is awaiting a new dispensation and with the Trump \"administration\" flailing wildly amidst faux-pas after tweeted faux-pas, the political left seem in a prime position to offer it, as long as they can transcend tribal identities and be more open to dialogue and compromise with those who differ from them on hot-button issues. Though I would not consider myself a liberal, I do share Lilla's belief that government is often necessary to provide programs like health care and I think Lilla writes fairly (he admits that if identity is largely about social construction, then Rachel Dolezal and her supporters have a point in claiming that she is black).

But he warns us away from identity politics. It is not a winning strategy, we are told. We can be as woke as we like, but a predicate assumption to supporting any political position is the power to implement it, and on this front the Left in this country has been woefully, if not irretrievably outflanked.I'm not sure I join Lilla in his mocking denunciation of \"social justice warriors,\" and I wonder how he proposes that black people bring light to their brutalization by the state without saying something akin to \"Black Lives Matter,\" which Lilla derides as hopelessly counterproductive. But I do think the American Left needs to seriously rethink its rhetoric and strategy if it ever wants to regain power in this country. Sadly, Lilla doesn't really provide us with any answers--even the class-based call for unity he derides.

The core issue with Lilla\u2019s book is that he has a muddled and inconsistent understanding of relationship between individualism and Liberalism. This, for an author who is an intellectual historian and is a self-proclaimed Liberal, is extremely embarrassing.Lilla critiques at length the individualism of Reagan\u2019s politics, claiming that it destroyed the concept of \u2018citizenship\u2019, which entailed both rights and duties for every American. Instead, he says that Reagan ushered in the era of atomized suburban families, who would reach their apogee in the Tea Party. The maxim of Reagan and his libertarian descendants was \u2018government is good for nothing, so leave us alone!\u2019 He then paints identity politics as the Left\u2019s counter-punch to Reagan\u2019s bleak and self-interested system. However, Lilla claims that identity politics lost its way: it started out as mass group politics to correct injustices, (the Civil Rights movement, the Women\u2019s suffrage movement), but devolved into college students discussing the oppression of their own racial or gender categories. Therefore, he claims that identity politics is only a surface-level response, keeping the individualistic core of Reaganism while substituting its top-level values.Lilla\u2019s solution is to return to \u2018citizenship\u2019 as the basis for American political life. He believes that the problems identity politics calls out in American society \u2014 systemic racism, sexual violence and patriarchy, homophobia \u2014 can all be solved through pragmatic politics and the idea of \u2018equal protection under the law\u2019. This, for me, is where Lilla\u2019s intellectual dishonesty begins to seep in. He understands enough about the claims of the identity politics movements to know that nothing short of a fundamental restructuring of American society can solve their demands. For example, \t* To protect black people, both casual and systemic racism will have to be purged from American society. \t* To protect women and queer people, the basis of private life (the heterosexual nuclear family) will have to be replaced, or at least supplemented. \t* Reparations to Native Americans may require giving back the land. Not everything can be corrected through legislation, civil rights enforcement, and a civic ethos. If Mark Lilla expects there to be social justice, then he cannot comfortably live in his Brooklyn brownstone while his homeownership gentrifies his neighborhood and he steps over homeless people on the street.Further, Lilla thinks that there is no vision of communal life being put forward to challenge Reaganist individualism. But he does not understand that identity politics, except in their most vapid format, are visions of communal life. He claims dishonestly that intellectual politics are all about the specialness of the individual \u2014 invoking the stupid cajoles of alt-right commentators about \u2018snowflakes\u2019 on college campuses. Yet he is either unaware of the intellectual legacy of afro-futurism, ecofeminism, and queer liberationism (to name only a few), or has intentionally chosen to overlook them. These are all visions of how we should live together in society, how we would define citizenship, and what is expected of each member of our community. I have some other unorganized thoughts on Lilla\u2019s book, which I will leave below:\t* He has a silly reverence for \u2018pragmatic\u2019 politics, while forgetting that mass movements are what push politicians to do things for the people. For example, his description of LBJ is hagiographic when discussing the Voting Rights Act. Lilla says that MLK\u2019s movement would have died without any achievements had LBJ not been willing to make deals and compromise with Congress to pass legislation restoring rights to black Americans. But this is silly: to think that LBJ would have done anything for blacks had the South not been foaming with riots and mass demonstrations is nonsense. \t* Lilla seems confused about whether he believes individualism is a recent phenomenon in America (introduced by Reagan) or is the long-running core of American political thought, (introduced by the Calvinist settlers of the continent). Or, if he is making a more nuanced argument about the origins of individualism, it was lost on me.\t* His critique of identity politics is one-sided and hollow: Lilla presents the best arguments for Liberalism against an ill-formed presentation of identity politics. (He talks about college freshmen\u2019s arguments about race, instead of the arguments of intellectuals like bell hooks or Ta-Nehisi Coates. Lilla never presents a substantial critique of Liberalism, which he would have discovered after five minutes of research in any branch of an identity politics movement.)\t* If you want to read about the value of citizenship and overlapping consensus in politics, just go read Rawls. At least then you will have an intelligent mind to grapple with."}, {"userName": "Mars Cheung", "userReviewDate": "Sep 05, 2017", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/49788249-mars-cheung", "userReview": "The general message was well-worth hearing although some of the points regarding the Roosevelt/Reagan dispositions were difficult to understand.

Lilla, whose earlier work \"The Shipwrecked Mind: On Political Reaction,\" deftly navigates the historical and psychological forces which animate the conservative mind, urgently writes that unless liberals make a strong course correction away from identity, they will continue to suffer defeat at the polling booth. His case fits generally into the literary consensus emerging in other popular works like \"Hillbilly Elegy,\" \"White Trash,\" and \"Strangers in Their Own Land\": rural, working-class Americans have been abandoned by urban liberals who are more focused on winning rights for narrowly-defined identity groups than the well-being of vast stretches of white, impoverished America. That these regions of the country cast their ballots for Trump should therefore come as no surprise, given what Lilla terms \"The Abidication\" of progressives.As with Arthur M. Schlesinger, Jr's 1991 publication \"The Disuniting of America: Reflections on a Multicultural Society,\" Lilla seems to suggest this embrace of identity on the left was purely elective. Faced with the overwhelming evidence of, say, police brutality toward African-American motorists documented over the past several years, what would he have people do? Forget organizing movements like Black Lives Matter and focus instead on running for the local water board? Faced with the massive pay disparities between male and female wage earners, should we ratchet-down the invective and instead try to convince our neighbor over the fence that women should receive the same pay as men? Of course, mass protests and shouted slogans alone cannot affect political change. In the end, people must participate in the government they seek to alter. But Lilla presents this as a zero-sum game: either protest, or get serious. One can do both.Take his argument that the radical change in public attitudes toward gays occurred not because of gay marches and slogans, but because family members began coming out to each other. Once people realized someone they knew or loved was gay, their attitude changed. This ignores the role the gay identity movement played in helping many gays and lesbians develop the self-confidence to come out in the first place. I witnessed this first-hand in one of my college friends. Without his prior involvement in gay pride parades and identity activities, he would never have come out to his parents.Sometimes, the identity movement can trigger the heartfelt conversations which change attitudes.Lilla also ignores the fact that reactionary forces today are largely impervious to reasonable argument. There is a deep sense among progressives that any effort spent trying to change a conservative's mind is wasted. Indeed, in a so-called post-truth era, people simply choose whatever \"facts\" appeal to their already-held biases. Lilla's picture of America is a Norman Rockwell painting when it more closely resembles a photo of Charlottesville.Yet, for all this, I worry he may be correct. That if Democrats want to win large reaches of the country, they will have to tone-down their support for blacks, women, gays, and other ostracized groups. In the end, it will have less to do with de-emphasizing some nebulous concept of \"identity,\" and everything to do with appeasing white conservative prejudice. And one needn't go very far back to see a similar capitulation-- just look at Bill Clinton's shift to the right in 1996. We can thank Democrats for the prison-industrial complex, Government Sachs, and the characterization of black men as \"superpredators.\"Faced with this possibility, is it not fortunate that groups like BLM exist to continue holding liberals' feet to the fire, forcing them to declare what they stand for?\"The Once and Future Liberal\" is required reading for anyone concerned about our country today and how to take it back."}, {"userName": "Mort", "userReviewDate": "Mar 03, 2018", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/20230-mort", "userReview": "Equal parts inane and infuriating.

The focus here is on what it means to participate in the governing of a country as one of its citizens, a membership we all share as Americans. That being, maintaining your awareness of fundamental flaws in our system based on varying identities but functioning as a unified political citizenry to make the case for the development of political solutions that work to benefit as many communities as possible, all the while not allowing the fetishizing of every bit of individuality to divide what could otherwise be an effective coalition working towards a shared objective.

As a proud gay man, I feel the importance of identity politics but also worry about forces that differentiate us rather than bring us together - and that bringing together is ever more important if we are to go forward after this presidency. Lilla's firm diagnosis of the error in focusing almost wholly on identity politics (while still acknowledging their importance and effect) is firm and no-nonsense. Having seen many queer folk not willing to get to know conservative heteros but demanding full acknowledgement and rights from them left me feeling like something was off despite wanting those same rights. While I think Lilla is potentially too harsh at times, I'm convinced that the work the left needs to do should be messaging that resonates with all Americans and pushes legislative progress because of our shared bond as American citizens rather than pushing for special interests. However, I'm afraid this book won't be well received by many due to its, in my opinion unfair, consideration of social justice movements, Black Lives Matter, etc. In this regard, Lilla seems a little insensitive and out of touch.

I compare this to a book like Audacity by Jonathan Chait, which struck me as very well sourced as well as polemically argued, and this book falls far short -- especially when considering that it is written by a historian, who must have a bit of contempt for the ability of his audience to take in facts along with opinions.***Having finished the audio-book, my opinion of the work is if possible even lower. The diatribe against \"identity\" is never shored up with documentation, other than the idea that this type of thinking has somehow been originated at, fomented at, and fostered at universities and has corrupted the youth of America. I'm a lot more concerned about the macro-aggressions and outright violence aimed against differently colored minorities, women, and LGTs, than I am about micro-aggressions, though I can accept the argument that micro-aggressions might at least sometimes provoke macro-aggressions. By and large though, I think the macro-aggressions are straight out power plays, and calling resistance against violence narcissistic is just the old conservative b.s. warmed over.

There are especially cringe-worthy, offhand references to the Mau Mau revolt and \"shamans,\" where Lilla's rhetorical frequent framing around metaphors of religiosity presents itself with historical assumptions that have not been relevant since before the Civil Rights movement."}, {"userName": "Stephen Wong", "userReviewDate": "Feb 14, 2018", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/6006061-stephen-wong", "userReview": "Book review of The Once and Future Liberal: After Identity Politics, by Mark Lilla (2017)Certainly a work of polemics, the book is a \"manifesto for the (re-)discovery of a manifesto\". Mark Lilla makes an argument about a need to ceaselessly niggle and annoy the so-called New Left (which has been around for perhaps 50 years or the span of three generations) to return to a kind of \"Roosevelt dispensation\" and leave behind the \"Reagan dispensation\" (obviously in an American context, in the time of Donald Trump). And in doing so, then perhaps to retrieve a politics of citizenship and solidarity, to reverse the sentimentality of identity politics, to obsolesce the university's obsessions with this liberal sentimentality (the retreat of the New Left and its bastion), and to enhance the action potential of, for lack of a better word, the \"cosmological axis\" of citizenship to world-at-large (against the pejorative of solipsisms of political identity). Thus in the book's title, \"The Once and Future\": the work is one of retrieval for when a certain tomorrow were to take place. And that it should. As far as manifestos go, it is a call for cadres, or rather for the creation of cadres, to take power in the various subsidiarities of institutional politics, and to move away from movement politics outside of power and the blandishments towards and, in extremis, the hostilities against institutional power that have pursued and now inevitably turn against it. This latter of course is the stock in trade of a demagoguery (\"drain the swamp\") which ironically also represents the fascist conniption (or complex) of the Carl Schmittian executive speaking in parlance of friend-enemy. Lilla castigates the Left for ceding institutional power to the Right since Ronald Reagan, and in his casting blame fingers identity politics as the be-all-and-through-all, its own means towards its own ends. It is however a book that might create in its vacuum a countervailing apologetics for identity politics. Well, actually not. For by definition the concern of identity politics, which Lilla attacks in the book, is so far removed from the language or survey of an apologia. Lilla does not dwell on the question, \"Why should identity politics even exist?\" except to suggest that the 1960s marked a turning point towards the disjunctive presidency of Jimmy Carter of the late-70s-early-80s, before Reagan. Perhaps the answer to that question is to be found in the sloganeering behind \"the personal is political\"; Lilla in some way goes a little distance in subverting it but he isn't sure if he should. He does not negate it in the copula, that \"the personal is not political\"; he claims instead that the predicate is negated in its terms, or if not negated, then withheld: \"the personal is apolitical\". On this thesis, he may be correct in his phenomenological investigation of identity politics, at least were the New Left's understanding of the political still had anything to do with acquiring power. Above I deployed Marshall McLuhan's tetrad of media effects: that a new medium will enhance, make obsolete, retrieve, and revert any effects by its coming to exist in a background media ecology. This method of analysis is suggestive for \"identity politics\" as medium in an infinite tetrad loop unto itself. By this method, we could characterize Lilla's polemics as a specie of identity politics of the traditional Left upon the newfangled New Left. There are prescriptives as well as ekphrasis (description of the landscape) and figuring from ground as well as grounding and re-grounding and re-figuring in Lilla's investigation. The attempt separates itself from other forms of polemics against the \"Trump dispensation\", which could very well be a disjunctive presidency such as Jimmy Carter's, which does spell an opportunity for the New Left to be rid, if momentarily, of its albatross of self-absorptions, and become opportunists about taking power in all subsidiarities of government. There seems to be some awakening thereto, by way of rudeness, but its quality is still one of nightmarish feeling for the walls in a blindness or pitch darkness rather than of enlightened dreaming or fantasy for the clarity of what taking and holding power can accomplish. Lilla does not go on to suggest anything about this \"New Day in America\", to borrow a Reagan campaign phrase, except to turn the dwellers from the shadows on the walls inside Plato's cave. Or to try anyway.In other words, Lilla would like to give the American New Left a chance at a mulligan, to swing at it again, if only they would get off the golf cart. They are on the links (literally nicht rechts), but have been refusing to play. Or perhaps there is that inherent idiocy of clubbing a dimpled ball only to then chase after it. For the New Left, just thinking about it is way too bothersome."}, {"userName": "Tucker", "userReviewDate": "Jan 24, 2018", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/308912-tucker", "userReview": "One can easily get on board with Lilla\u2019s idea that Americans should support each other\u2019s basic rights \u2014 whether for the \u201cpositive\u201d reason of our shared American identity or for the \u201cnegative\u201d reason that our more specific identities should not matter \u2014 but, as I see it, there is no reason why this vision should be limited to the Democratic Party. The Republican Party also needs to embrace it and get real about what it implies for the policies they endorse and the rhetoric they use. When both parties are vigorously defending human rights and dignity, each can get down to the more productive labor of hammering out specific policies to serve that greater shared purpose, and then the electorate can cast their votes in favor of the tax laws or healthcare policy they would prefer to see rather than out of existential fear that one party is out to destroy them. I don't know why that wasn't an obvious point to make, as long as the book was going to be idealistic anyway.Lilla criticizes the way that marginalized groups use \"identity politics\" to secure their rights. This criticism is so imprecise that it is difficult to understand what he means. He says \u201cBlack Lives Matter is a textbook example of how not to build solidarity,\u201d a criticism he supports with one sentence mentioning some generalities about this enormous grassroots movement. He also says that transgender people have been \u201cgiven temporary totemic significance\u201d in the political arena, something he does not explain at all. This statement is (a) confusing because transgender people need to care about the significance of their own existence all the time (not just for one election cycle, and definitely not never), all the more so if political leaders don't do some of the caring for them, and (b) not persuasive because, if \u201ctotemic\u201d is here synonymous with \u201cconceptual\u201d or \"emblematic,\" it sails past the obvious fact that transgender people see themselves existing in reality and not just in the realm of what other people believe about them. The book's only other reference to transgender people is that they \"suffer far worse\" injuries and indignities than being threatened on the street, a statement that at least acknowledges that they have material existence and face actual problems and thus are not merely totems in other people's imaginations, but remains extremely vague and does not justify anyone in drawing any particular conclusion about them. As a result, Lilla's truism that, when discussing any important principle with a political opponent, \u201cthere are usually other, equally important principles that might have to be sacrificed to preserve this one,\u201d rings ominously. It isn\u2019t just principles that are being sacrificed. After all, he said that the overarching principle of liberalism is (or should be) a version of no citizen left behind. If we begin compromising away sub-principles, we have to ask: What citizen is to be sacrificed?I wrote a longer review on Disruptive Dissertation."}, {"userName": "Keith Davis", "userReviewDate": "Feb 13, 2018", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/2439329-keith-davis", "userReview": "Lilla argues that the Democratic Party went down a blind alley after Ronald Reagan's victory in 1980. American liberals enjoyed about 40 years of success following a political vision articulated by Franklin Roosevelt. The idea of America presented by FDR and his successors, such as Kennedy and Johnson, was one of all American citizens working together to overcome adversity. This vision perfectly suited the Great Depression and World War II, and complemented the Civil Rights Movement. That vision was supplanted by Reagan's libertarian view of an America made up of independent individuals achieving success without help from anyone else. That vision of America better suited a time of economic prosperity and America's brief status as the world's only super power after the collapse of the Soviet Union.Rather than articulate a new vision of collective action, American liberals perused identity politics. In identity politics the crucial factor is not what unifies people as Americans, it is the uncontrollable factors of birth that make people different from each other. Lilla describes this as the opposite of politics. Identity politics is about marches and rallies that make people feel proud of their unique group. Real politics is about doing the no-fun work of running for county commission seats and school boards and convincing people who are different than you that it is in both your interests to work together for the common good.One the most appealing ideas of liberalism is the fact that it is about expanding the circle. Through out history liberals have worked to bring more groups into the circle while conservatives work to make the circle smaller. The United States began as a democracy where only land owning adult white males could vote. Over time that circle was expanded to include all white men, then men regardless of race, then all women. The conservative impulse is to exclude, to shrink the circle back down to just white people, just Christians, just men, just my family, and then the ultimate nadir of Trumpism: just me. Identity politics is about creating new circles within the big circle. The Democratic Party seems like less of a unified party and more like the Women's Party, the African American Party, the Immigrant Party, and the LGBT Party which occasionally caucus together but do not have the same agenda. The obvious counter-argument to this is to argue that the Civil Rights and the Women's Rights movements were identity movements, but they were also about securing equal rights as American citizens.Many pro-identity politics critics have dismissed Liila's argument because he is a white male and therefore unqualified to speak to issues affecting women and minorities. While that is a correct analysis of Lilla's identity, it assumes the truth of identity politics in order to defend identity politics. I do not believe Lilla is actually saying anything about any group within the world of identity politics, he is saying that all the groups need to get past self absorption and return to collective action for the good of all citizens.The most optimistic development to come out of the Trump catastrophe is that more liberals are realizing they have to do the hard work of local and state politics to push back against the Republican machine that has allowed unqualified extremist candidates to get elected to local and national office. It is a lot easier to take a day off from work, make a clever sign, and march in a parade, but parades do not win local elections."}, {"userName": "Tristan", "userReviewDate": "Mar 02, 2018", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/20262189-tristan", "userReview": "This book is great and mercifully short. Basically, Lilla argues that identity politics is \"Reaganism for lefties\" because it encourages atomization and instils a disregard for traditional politics. That is, identity politics fractures the left-wing solidarity that's needed to win elections. And, as Lilla states, only by winning elections can progressives hope to maintain the gains of the past 50 years while striving for new ones. Lilla is a man who despises Donald Trump (he explicitly says that Trump supporters \"have no excuse for voting for him\"), and offers a solid diagnosis of problems with the left that played a part in Trump's election. Therefore, it's unfortunate that Lilla's book has been pilloried in left-wing publications (eg. https://www.nytimes.com/2017/08/15/bo...). Lilla says it well, so I'll throw in a few quotes for potential readers. (And as I said, this book is short - it is maybe a 3 hour read, so you really have no excuse for skipping it.)\"If the steady advance of a radicalized Republican Party ... should teach liberals anything, it is the absolute priority of winning elections today. Given the Republicans' rage for destruction, it is the only way to guarantee that newly won protections for African-Americans, other minorities, women, and gay Americans remain in place. Workshops and university seminars will not do it. Online mobilizing and flash mobs will not do it. Protesting, acting up, and acting out will not do it.\"\"What's extraordinary - and appalling - about the past four decades of our history is that our politics has been dominated by two ideologies that encourage and even celebrate the unmaking of citizens. On the right, an ideology that questions the existence of a common good and denies our obligations to help fellow citizens, through government action if necessary. On the left, an ideology institutionalized in colleges and universities that fetishizes our individual and group attachments, applauds self-absorption, and casts a shadow of suspicion over any invocation of a universal democratic we.\"\"Equal protection under the law is not a hard principle to convince Americans of. The difficulty comes in persuading them that it has been violated in particular cases, and of the need to redress the wrong. Prejudice and indifference run deep. Education, social reform, and political action can persuade some. But most people will not feel the sufferings of others unless they feel, even in an abstract way, that it could have been me or someone close to me.\""}, {"userName": "CarolynKost", "userReviewDate": "Sep 14, 2017", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/23556685-carolynkost", "userReview": "Lilla's thesis is that rather than developing a \"fresh political vision of the country's shared destiny....liberals threw themselves into the movement politics of...racial, gender and sexual identity...losing a sense of what we share as citizens and what binds us as a nation.\" The \"increasingly narrow and exclusionary self-definition...turns young people back onto themselves, rather than...outward toward the wider world.\" Add to this the thought police and political correctness and we have \"a new, and very revealing, locution [that] has drifted from our universities into the media mainstream: Speaking as an X \u2026 This is not an anodyne phrase. It tells the listener that I am speaking from a privileged position on this matter. It sets up a wall against questions, which by definition come from a non-X perspective. And it turns the encounter into a power relation: The winner of the argument will be whoever has invoked the morally superior identity and expressed the most outrage at being questioned.\"So classroom conversations that once might have begun, I think A, and here is my argument, now take the form, Speaking as an X, I am offended that you claim B. This makes perfect sense if you believe that identity determines everything. It means that there is no impartial space for dialogue. What replaces argument, then, is taboo.\" Moreover, with continual demands to attend to movement and group identity history in curricula, it's important to note that \"Neither Elizabeth Cady Stanton (who studied Greek) nor Martin Luther King Jr. (who studied Christian theology) nor Angela Davis (who studied Western philosophy) received an identity-based education. And it is difficult to imagine them becoming who they became had they been cursed with one. The fervor of their rebellion demonstrated the degree to which their education had widened their horizons and developed in them a feeling of democratic solidarity rare in America today.\"As it would stray from his thesis, Lilla may be forgiven for not including a mention of the erosion of civil liberties by these same illiberal factions. Pew and Gallup surveys indicate that young people favor curtailing freedom of speech and freedom of religion, among others. Coupled with the other phenomena, there is justifiable cause for concern about the future of our nation. We need some serious civics education about the founding principles of the USA. If you have read Lilla's articles on identity politics in The New York Times, The Wall Street Journal, and The Chronicle of Higher Education, you need not read this book, as complete passages are shared and no new ideas are introduced.

It does a good job at describing the loss of a sense of civic duty and collective interest that took place on the right under Reagan, and does a good job at describing how identity politics on the left is making coordinated political action quite difficult and puts the left at a significant disadvantage against the right. The right is extremely guilty of identity politics, but it's only one identity, while the left has a diversity.The book's major shortcoming is that, well, it's so short. It only passingly acknowledges how the traditional sense of collective interest didn't make much room for women and minorities, and seems to mostly blame egocentric pedagogy for the rise of identity politics. He does not really address the concept of privilege, which seems like a glaring oversight. Pedagogy may be an issue, but identity politics would not be so effective if it weren't for structural unfairness in society. It seems to me that the rise of identity politics is, while a problem in some very significant ways, also good in the sense that the media and the general public have never before given so much credence to non-white-male points view.A subject like identity politics requires a lot of nuance if one wants to be totally fair, and this book is simply too short to address all the nuances of the issue properly. That said, it is still a very good read, and does a solid job of communicating what is to be gained by framing things in terms of collective interest rather than narrow group interest. If progressives want to make change, they need to win elections, and to do that they need to make everyone feel like whatever our differences are, we're in this thing together."}, {"userName": "John Boyne", "userReviewDate": "Mar 24, 2018", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/75414900-john-boyne", "userReview": "To begin a full disclosure. I am a conservative Republican who probably spent more time disagreeing with what Mark says here than agreeing with him. However, I would confidently say that Mark is my favorite liberal writer, which is saying a lot. I was first introduced to Mark when he wrote on the topic of identity politics for the Wall Street Journal. This books is a completion to that article. Mark correctly points out how the education system has created a generation of Democrats who no longer care for their country but instead focus to much on caring for their supposed identities. This inward turn has made individuals unable to fully engage in civic society and has caused great weakness in the Democratic Party. While I agree with him on that we go in opposite directions when he presents his solution. He believes the Left needs to return to a civic liberalism similar in scope to the Roosevelt era. Where the citizen needs to be propped up more than anything else. I don\u2019t see that happening because on top of the identity oriented education liberals receive today, they are also taught to hate this county. Their history classes focuses almost exclusively on slavery, Native American oppression and civil rights. Most kids leave school thinking nothing really good came from this country. It\u2019s a love for this country that needs to be instilled in these kids. And that is what conservatism does right. Mark continues to spread the falsehoods of conservatives, believing them to be inherently bigoted and thinking that if you don\u2019t want government to run everything to supposedly solves societies ills then you must be a rugged individualist who doesn\u2019t care about other people.

Although there have been Democrats in the White House, and some notable policy achievements, for nearly 40 years the vision that Ronald Reagan offered\u2014small government, lower taxes, and self-reliant individualism\u2014has remained the country\u2019s dominant political ideology. And the Democratic Party has offered no convincing competing vision in response.Instead, as Lilla argues, American liberalism fell under the spell of identity politics, with disastrous consequences. Driven originally by a sincere desire to protect the most vulnerable Americans, the left has now unwittingly balkanized the electorate, encouraged self-absorption rather than solidarity, and invested its energies in social movements rather than in party politics.\u00a0With dire consequences. Lilla goes on to show how the left\u2019s identity-focused individualism insidiously conspired with the amoral economic individualism of the Reaganite right to shape an electorate with little sense of a shared future and near-contempt for the idea of the common good. In the contest for the American imagination, liberals have abdicated.Now they have an opportunity to reset. The left is motivated, and the Republican Party, led by an unpredictable demagogue, is in ideological disarray. To seize this opportunity, Lilla insists, liberals must concentrate their efforts on recapturing our institutions by winning elections. The time for hectoring is over.
