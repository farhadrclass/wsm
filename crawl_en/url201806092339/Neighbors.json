Momentum shifts throughout. For me, this book represents a new discovery of a writer who also wrote Little Big Man, which was made into a well-regarded film starring Dustin Hoffman. Neighbors was also made into a film -- a bad one starring John Belushi and Dan Aykroyd. Funny, I can't see them in this role. I picture Jason Alexander for Keese and Dennis Quaid for Harry.This is a black comedy so you have to prepare yourself properly. I didn't. The events that happen in this novel are so outrageous that I put the book away thinking it was crap. I came to this conclusion (premature, I admit) because I was reading mostly realistic novels and stories, so to suddenly find myself in the land of the strange, I couldn't cope. After a week, I picked it up again and decided to really teach myself how to read this author -- his unique style, content, and vision. This is important because things will happen in the novel that will not be in synch with your (or anyone else's) reality. The end result? This was probably the most entertaining book I've read all summer (and I've read quite a bit, thank you very much).It's very dialogue-heavy, which was the first major obstacle for me. (I don't like characters who talk too much) The decision-making of the characters was the second major obstacle. Frankly, I couldn't believe people with such judgments existed in real life! But these two obstacles turned out to be non-issues as soon as I learned to enter Berger's world of misfits."}, {"userName": "Mike McPadden", "userReviewDate": "Apr 16, 2013", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/8078114-mike-mcpadden", "userReview": "NEIGHBORS made me hyperventilate. No other book conjures such a \"trapped in the funhouse\" feeling, wherein every page makes you feel like you just turned and slammed your face into yet another glass wall or distorted mirror. The book, in and of itself, is NOT unfilmable, but the botched Belushi-Aykroyd attempt pretty well iced any chance of a proper version ever existing. Berger is one of my favorite authors, and I'd recommend NEIGHBORS to anyone\u2014but THE FEUD, I'd say, is really the best place to start."}, {"userName": "Cecily", "userReviewDate": "Dec 02, 2010", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/1199525-cecily", "userReview": "This is like no other book I have read. Twenty four hours in nearly 300 pages reads almost like real-time, which works well in this story of strange neighbours. Each individual incident is plausible, but in combination, it creates an acutely observed surreal nightmare of escalating paranoia.Earl and Enid are are in their late 40s (but seem older) and long time residents of a quiet road. Their predicable life is overturned by the arrival of new neighbours. Harry and Ramona's unabashed presumptiousness and mind games make Earl lose touch with reality and doubt his sanity: trespass, pointless lies, vandalism and worse.It's bad enough when strangers are weird and unpleasant, but it is far worse when they are in your own home and when your own family, friends and even random strangers seem to be against you for no reason. And it is relentless, \"He believed that she and Harry worked by attrition\" so that \"Every time he believed he had got things in hand at last, another threat appeared\".At one point, Ramona says \"ownership means everything to you\" and also asks \"how far would you go to avoid humiliation?\", which are the crux of the mental assault. This makes Earl behave increasingly out of character, \"His persistent conviction that he had been mocked... relieved him of the claims of decency\".No matter how he tries to play it, Earl finds himself wrong-footed by bizarre behaviour and strange non sequiturs. At one point, Ramona has taken over his bed and when challenged, says \"It's your house, your bedroom, your bed. What's fair? Do we get any kind of vote?\" One quirk is the overuse of the word \"chagrin\", even as a verb, \"chagrining though it might be\"! Nevertheless, it is a painfully realised and expertly written book.Near the beginning, it mentions that Earl is prone to hallucinations (\"he was at odds with humanity as to one of its incontestable truths: seeing is believing\"), but it is not mentioned again. So how much of the story is real?"}, {"userName": "Mark Desrosiers", "userReviewDate": "Aug 03, 2014", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/88991-mark-desrosiers", "userReview": "The key to this relentless nightmare is right there on page one: \"Were Keese to accept the literal witness of his eyes, his life would have been of quite another character, perhaps catastrophic, for outlandish illusions were, if not habitual with him, then at least none too rare for that sort of thing.\" And so as we read on, always from Keese's point of view, you're led to doubt whether depictions of his neighbors Harry and Ramona are accurate -- that they may be the ramping up of his own peculiar malady. Another novel can be written of the same weekend's events, from Ramona's perspective (for example) depicting Keese as a twitchy paranoid psychotic in deep need of help and restraint. As a narrative, there are broad themes kicked around in here about \"country\" versus \"city\" and the monstrous violence that is barely suppressed in quiet civil towns. But on the whole I think Berger is hoodwinking us into believing the new neighbors are nutzoid, when in fact it's our central character whose brain has created this nightmare -- let's not forget the sudden ending (no spoilers here) which seems to join hands with the page-one statement above as some sort of anatomical inevitability.

It was difficult not too see the actors as I read but still I found a lot to like about it. Riding through the story, now directly inside the mind of Earl Keese was enlightening.

Berger makes it readable and fascinating even though the characters are extremely annoying, especially the middle aged drone Earl. Berger works a brutal satire on how most middle aged Americans choose to live: with zero passion or spontaneity. The neighbors Harry and Ramona remain ambiguous all the way to the end, are they angels or demons? Their anarchic lifestyle is either to be applauded or condemned. Berger knew the emptiness of the American soul and this novel is a look at just how banal it is."}, {"userName": "ginny", "userReviewDate": "Jul 05, 2011", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/21012-ginny", "userReview": "Weird and funny and disorienting. As someone who is frequently the new family on the street, it was an engaging read. The plot centers around a middle aged man (and his wife) who leads a pretty banal existence in a quiet neighborhood with only one other house on his street.

And I am not kidding about it. By saying this I am probably going against a majority, who seem to love this book. When I purchased this book I purely went by reader reviews and said to myself, man I have to read this book. The book starts off really well by introducing us to Keese the protoganist if I may say so. Keese is seemingly a laid back guy, happy with his house and life on a dead end street with the only daughter in college. Everything is laid out for him including the with whom he is going to have the weekend dinner every weekend. Now enter the neighbors (from hell?) Harry and Ramona. The way these characters enter Reese's life is extremely interesting and this definitely gets the reader going. Then things start to become strange, then weirder and weirder. What seems to start off as childish pranks with neighbors turns into something inexplicable and unreal overnight.I chugged on, respecting many reviews, waiting for the jaw dropping ending that will make it all worthwhile, but it never comes. The whole premise and some situations seem outrageously unreal. Again the story ends on a weirdest note. Through the reading,the earlier part that is, I started empathizing with Reese as we are made to feel that everybody is against him and doesn't understand him at all. But halfway through the book I am ready to slap every character silly starting with Reese. I wish I could or hoped that it was just a bad dream Reese is having. Alas!I hope this sums my feelings for this book and may be deter a reader or two from taking this mind numbing, outlandish, bizarre book called Neighbors. But so called dark comedy is your cup of tea, I wish you a very happy reading!"}, {"userName": "Clarinda Dodson", "userReviewDate": "Dec 29, 2011", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/7008981-clarinda-dodson", "userReview": "This review was originally written on my blog back in 2006If you can avoid this book, I definitely would not read it again! Maybe the cover should've been a clue to me. The entire time I was reading this book, I kept thinking that the ending would redeem it for me...make it worth my time.Unfortunately, this was not the case.The story is about a family who lives on a dead end street. New neighbors move into the only other house on the street, and all sorts of trouble ensues. The husband and wife want to have the new couple over for dinner, but before they can even extend the invitation, the new couple, Harry and Ramona, stops by and sort of invites themselves. The entire book chronicles the rest of the evening and the next day. It is full of misunderstandings and complete and total misbehavior on the part of the new neighbors.I felt that I didn't really understand the motivation of any of the characters. The situations that the characters got into were difficult for me to read--not because they were crude or inappropriate, but simply because they made me uncomfortable.I kept thinking (hoping) that it would end with the main character, Earl, awaking from a dream. These situations were just too absurd for me to believe that they would be a reality. Instead the book ends (here's the spoiler), with Earl having a heart attack and dying. It turns out that it was all real and that the stress of the entire situation kills him.It was such a disappointment!"}, {"userName": "Mark R.", "userReviewDate": "Mar 06, 2013", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/47081-mark-r", "userReview": "Thomas Berger's strange bit of absurd comedy is about a man at war with his neighbors (and his wife and his daughter, and his other neighbors, and most definitely himself...). Gerald Keese invites in his neighbors Harry and Ramona, and over the course of the next twenty-four hours, he alternately fends them off, fights with Harry, spurns Ramona's sexual advances, is accused of harassment, invites them back in, tries to hurt them, tries to help them, etc.At some points the reader wonders whether there is not some elaborate hoax being put upon poor Mr. Keese, particularly when he phones his friends for help and is rebuffed, or when he calls an auto service company is thrown into the same kind of fire in which Harry tossed him earlier.After a while, Keese begins to doubt himself. As seemingly conniving and at the same time helpful as Harry and Ramona appear to be, Keese can't seem to get away from them, and he starts to really lose his head. This is an odd book, and we don't get many answers concerning elements which in a more straight-forward story would seem important. The book could probably be cut down a little shorter, though it isn't exactly long to begin with. The back and forth between Harry and his neighbors does tire a bit after a while, but otherwise, \"Neighbors\" is a strange and intriguing story of civilized middle-class combat."}, {"userName": "Doug", "userReviewDate": "Apr 13, 2013", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/12253960-doug", "userReview": "I picked this up out of curiosity because I have fond memories of a Ackroyd / Belushi movie called neighbors. It was marketed as a comedy, and it was, but it was a dark comedy, like one of the funnier episodes of the twilight zone. The actors were cast against type - Ackroyd was in a Belushi-type role, and vice versa.So anyway, the book. It was often jarring. I read theories on the internet after were people sought to explain why this was the case. Guy has a wife and daughter, and obnoxious neighbors move next door. Sometimes his wife and daughter seem really to like them, and to disbelieve things that the guy witnessed the neighbors doing. Sometimes they seem afraid of the neighbors. But it's really just -- shifting. And are the neighbors just annoying, or malevolent, or good people? The novel takes place in the course of one long night. And I don't want to spoil the end.I thought this was a real page turner. And some would think it was a dark comedy. I found it kind of sad. Maybe because of where I'm at.

A fantasia on middle-class paranoia. And, perhaps above all, a lesson in how a comic master can make the same joke over and over (here, the explosions of aggression) and get a big laugh every time.

However, this theme is rather a thin frame upon which to hang an entire novel. In fact, Berger's plot drags for nearly 100 pages in the last half of the novel, as if the author himself is searching for a way to bring the novel's plot to the end. He eventually succeeds, unconvincingly, by a sudden twist in the last 5 paragraphs, but the entire book by then has become more like an experimental exercise than a true novel (in fact, it seemed to me that Berger had, perhaps, been immersing himself in Ioncesco's plays; many of the situations, and much of the dialogue, could have come directly from any number of the Rumanian-French author's works).
