As in other volumes, he is quite hard of the commanders on both sides. He makes a good case for Barbarossa being unwinnable. As in other volumes, the maps are first rate."}], "description": "Osprey's third and final volume in the Barbarossa trilogy, this title completes the account of the strategic intricacies of the German campaign against Russia. Detailing the final Nazi push for Moscow, Robert Kirchubel examines the causes behind the German failure, including the inability to re-supply troops or provide reserves, and the lack of decent German winter uniforms and transport.Full-color artwork, maps and bird's-eye views illustrate the campaign in detail, revealing how the Red Army capitalized on every German weakness in spite of its own flaws.", "title": "Operation Barbarossa 1941 (3): Army Group Center\n      \n          (Osprey Campaign #186)", "url": "http://www.goodreads.com/book/show/748529.Operation_Barbarossa_1941_3_", "average": 3.6, "cover": "https://images.gr-assets.com/books/1320554341l/748529.jpg", "reviews": 1, "authors": [{"url": "https://www.goodreads.com/author/show/396322.Robert_Kirchubel", "name": "Robert Kirchubel"}], "type": ["History", "War", "Military", "Literature"], "outlinks": ["http://www.goodreads.com/book/show/748529.Operation_Barbarossa_1941_3_", "http://www.goodreads.com/book/show/748531.Operation_Barbarossa_1941_1_", "http://www.goodreads.com/book/show/17262781-operation-barbarossa", "http://www.goodreads.com/book/show/748527.Operation_Barbarossa_1941_2_", "http://www.goodreads.com/book/show/25241835-atlas-of-the-eastern-front", "http://www.goodreads.com/book/show/19269943-operation-barbarossa---the-german-invasion-of-soviet-russia"]}
