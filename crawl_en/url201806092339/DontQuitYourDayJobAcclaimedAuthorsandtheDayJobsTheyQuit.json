With essays by some of my favorite writers, as well as work by many other authors I now want to read, every single one was a treasure. The essays were funny, touching, sweet, poignant, and beautiful, and each one was filled with such wonderful voice and lyrical language. I'm reading it aloud to my husband, and I see myself reading the individual essays again and again. If you love any of these writers, or you just love well-told stories, get this collection as quickly as you can."}, {"userName": "Scotchneat", "userReviewDate": "Aug 28, 2011", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/1076961-scotchneat", "userReview": "A collection of stories/confessions from \"Southern\" writers about the moment they \"quit their day job\", though some haven't quite yet.The different ways they tackled the challenge are probably a good reflection of writing style. Some gave humorous accounts, some purple prose, and some more or less engaging.I haven't read many of these authors. Most famous contributor is probably John Grisham. But I got a sense of how or why they feel compelled to write."}, {"userName": "Stacy", "userReviewDate": "Dec 25, 2010", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/3828779-stacy", "userReview": "This was an unexpectedly delightful read. I received this book a few years ago as a Christmas gift and while I was interested in the topic, just never picked up the book until now. So very sorry that I didn't read this sooner. Great stories from a variety of Southern authors regarding some of their non-writing jobs. I had only heard of a couple of these authors before (John Grisham, Pat Conroy, Winston Groom), but now I intend to read something by all the other authors."}, {"userName": "Ian Butler", "userReviewDate": "May 05, 2012", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/9103174-ian-butler", "userReview": "This is a great collection of stories by writers at the peak of their powers. The fact that Grisham holds a record for the number of rejections for a novel, tells you a lot about the perspiration and commitment needed for success. It certainly inspired me to finish my book 'Burger Bar Dad' which is coming out as an ebook at the end of May."}, {"userName": "Tiffany", "userReviewDate": "Feb 07, 2011", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/2192727-tiffany", "userReview": "A diverse collection of short stories from acclaimed Southern authors exploring the themes of first jobs, crappy jobs, and how these jobs have enhanced their work as writers."}, {"userName": "Jim Krotzman", "userReviewDate": "Aug 06, 2017", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/8919972-jim-krotzman", "userReview": "Don't Quit Your Day Job, edited by Sonny Brewer, narrated by selected authors, explains the first jobs they had and the effects those jobs had on their writing careers.

I especially loved the pieces by Connie May Fowler (\"Connie May Is Going to Win the Lottery This Week\"), Tom Franklin (\"Delivering\"), and Silas House (\"Why I Worked at the P.O\"). There is some unevenness in the collection, but overall I found it hilarious and insightful into what it takes to be a writer. Leave it to southerners to be unashamed about their shit jobs. We all should be, and, as Silas House notes, \"It was pure hell, but it was also the best thing I ever did for my writing.\""}, {"userName": "Mark Hainds", "userReviewDate": "May 12, 2013", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/4942985-mark-hainds", "userReview": "Having read this book at a critical juncture in my life, it may be argued that that this book exercised an undue influence upon my judgment and life\u2019s direction. Was it causative? Or simply correlative? Either way, Don\u2019t Quit Your Day Job deploys some fantastic stories, especially with the opening narratives. I believe my next book will utilize content from this book for more than one epigraph."}, {"userName": "Tom Long", "userReviewDate": "May 25, 2011", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/4069432-tom-long", "userReview": "When I taught at Behrend College, the faculty had a book club where we shared the children's books that had most influenced who we were becoming. It was fascinating. In this book, several authors share what they did before they \"quit their day job\" and how that has impacted their lives as writers. Grisham's entry seemed to be a bit of a throw away but most of the stories were compelling and provided a unique insight into each author's psyche."}, {"userName": "Virginia", "userReviewDate": "Mar 14, 2012", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/6493342-virginia", "userReview": "Some of the chapters are better than others. It seems too long to me: too much repetition, really. I guess this is a story that just is what it is: writers write, and they work at other jobs until their writing supports them. The details . . . eh. Mostly not that fascinating to me. I am also a writer, so perhaps this is why it seems ordinary to me?"}, {"userName": "Joanne Chantelau", "userReviewDate": "Aug 18, 2011", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/2384962-joanne-chantelau", "userReview": "Enjoyed almost all of these stories, written by writers...many of them fiction writers.

They\u2019ve worked on the railroad, busted rocks with a sledgehammer, fought fires, wiped tables, soldiered and carpentered and spied, delivered pizzas, lacquered boat paddles, counted heads for the church, sold underwear, delivered mail, and driven garbage trucks. And like William Faulkner before them, they have quit those day jobs. These authors tell good tales \u2014 this is the book for those who wonder what work preceded the literary efforts of their favorite authors. This collection allows writers to build a bridge between themselves and their readers, connecting with those who love to read and those who dream about writing while on the job during the day.",
