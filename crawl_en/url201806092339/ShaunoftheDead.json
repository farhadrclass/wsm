I really like the artwork, and it retains the humour and style of the film. My only problem is that I know the film SO well that I noticed the changes in some of the dialogue, especially some of my favourite interactions between Shaun and Pete which I know word for word and was therefore disappointed when some was cut out or cut short. Inevitable for a graphic novel adaptation of a movie, I know, and I appreciate that you can only cram so much in. In fairness it did that very well. It's just the double edged sword of it being one of my favourite movies and knowing it TOO well."}, {"userName": "Robert Gibbs", "userReviewDate": "Oct 21, 2014", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/32717813-robert-gibbs", "userReview": "Firstly, to start off as a bad note, 'How's that for a slice of fried gold?' didn't appear in this novel. That genuinely hurt my feelings. Anyway...This graphic novel is good for a collectible, for fans on the original film. However, for it to stand alone, I think it's a bit weak.The artwork itself is very nice, and I can admire it, but the book misses some of the dialogue that makes Shaun and Ed's friendship what it is. The humour, wit and sarcasm of conversation doesn't transfer nicely to paper either, it was a story written for screen and should be kept as that medium.This is not to say I didn't enjoy reading it, though I feel if you're not really a fan of the film, or haven't seen the film, it's maybe not worth the read. But I may be biased due to my love of the film.To conclude, I did enjoy reading this one, just not as much as I had hoped. But, if you're as much as a Simon Pegg fan as I am, this is definitely something to add to your collection."}, {"userName": "Jax Holt", "userReviewDate": "Dec 26, 2014", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/21764471-jax-holt", "userReview": "Shaun of the Dead the Graphic Novel is based on hit-film of the same name.The graphic novel follows the story of the life of Shaun. He works at an electric shop and has a normal life. He's messing everything up with his girlfriend Liz. We see his life change throughout the story. One day, something doesn't feel right... Which is that they are in a zombie apocalypse, which they don't know at first. After that we follow the story of Shaun, his best friend, Ed. His ex-girlfriend, Liz and her friends Diane and David. Shaun's mum and step-dad (only for a bit) as they head to The Winchester. The main character, Shaun is a brilliant character. The thing about his character is that he isn't anything special. He's an ordinary person, who messes up from time to time and we really see him develop from a man who doesn't really care about his responsibilities into someone loving, caring and responsible. Ed is a brilliant main character also and he makes me laugh, although he drifts nearer the end and he's still funny when he's a zombie...Liz, I do like her character but I got really bored of her character as she was repetitive and just kept on saying the same garbage. Diane and David where the secondary characters and where both very different characters. Diane at first was a decent character and turned into a very likeable character who wanted everyone to hear what she had to say! On the other hand, I'm happy about David's fate! Finally, Barbra and Phillip were brilliant additions and where faithful to the movie counterparts. Now, Yvonne was under utilised in the graphic novel as she wasn't used at the end!Overall, before the zombie apocalypse actually started I found the story to be boring but when it started to get into that aspect I was loving the story. It was fast paced and easy to keep up with the story. The illustrations in some parts are okay and others weren't brilliant. Some of it looks kid-like. The dialogue from the movie was featured but some funny and key parts where missing. The attack on The Winchester was shortened down and would have liked it to be longer...All in all, a good read and a must read for any zombie fan! It's filled with humour and emotional! It knows it's boundaries and tells a hell of a story.The rating may not be high but it wasn't brilliant, just good!"}, {"userName": "Chris Yarrow", "userReviewDate": "Jan 26, 2015", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/5050953-chris-yarrow", "userReview": "I got back int comic books last year so when I saw this on sale I picked up a copy for me and one for a friend. If you've watched the film then you know everything there is to know about this book. A lot of the scenes from the film are condensed into just a couple of panes and obviously most of the dialogue has been stripped out, though there are enough of your favourite lines for this to feel completely familiar. If you know the film then all of the characters in the book take on the voices of the actors as you read along - unless that's just me!I wasn't disappointed, but I probably expected too much from a comic that tries to condense one of my favourite films into a three-part story. Most of the artwork and direction comes straight from the film and there are a few panes that do a great job of illustrating some of the more complex action sequences. The dialogue is stripped down but *most* of the best lines from the film make it into the book. There's a lot missing, but if you were to cast your mind back to the film, everything you would probably remember is in this book.My main criticism is that the book doesn't take enough chances. There are plenty of opportunities to flesh out some of the scenes from the film and the only one the book attempts is when Shaun tries to give the zombies (are we using that word?) the slip at the Winchester after David smashes the pub window. Even if they didn't fill in some of the plot holes it might have been nice to see some more scenes from the film in the book - they could have easily turned this three book run into a four book run.Quicker than watching the film again, but not as enjoyable."}, {"userName": "Gabby", "userReviewDate": "Aug 13, 2016", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/11270515-gabby", "userReview": "Rating: 2.5 starsBeing a lover of zombies, graphic novels, and the movie this was based on; you can expect that I had quite high expectations.Shaun has a boring life, and the movie & book reflects that quite well. Wake up, work, video games, bed; repeat. But when you throw some zombies in the mix- that's where it gets a bit interesting...To be honest, this book was quite boring. I don't know if the reason I found this so boring is because I've already seen the movie, or whether that's just how it's meant to come across.I feel like this book is meant to be okay. You're meant to snicker at the jokes, not laugh. Meant to be moderately scared, but not terrified. And upset, but not brought to tears. It's just the way the illustrator / author has designed this graphic novel. I feel like if that is how this was designed to be, a light, humorous (zom-rom-com), easy-to read book; then it was done very successfully.Overall, an okay book and I was happy to have read this in 2016. Another zombie novel to be added to my \"read\" collection."}, {"userName": "David Gallagher", "userReviewDate": "Apr 17, 2011", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/3456763-david-gallagher", "userReview": "Usually films are based on comic books and not the other way around - mainly, I don't see the point why someone would create a comic book based on a movie. And of course, it's a faithful carbon of the movie, a very accurate translation. When I saw Shaun of the Dead some 6 odd years ago, I found it to be the best zombie movie ever. No, scratch that. Best British comedy ever. I've seen it a bunch of times ever since and it's just as great every other time. The comic book didn't deliver enough in terms of humor. I didn't laugh reading the comic, and the characters weren't half as interesting as they were in the movie. And even though it was the exact same screenplay, the comic book felt hastened and incomplete. But I hope Ryall knew that his comic book would be compared to the movie, and I hope he recognized the former was no match for the latter."}, {"userName": "Harry Brake", "userReviewDate": "Oct 11, 2015", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/14064432-harry-brake", "userReview": "I dig graphic novels, I get the zombie fascination, and understand this actually is a close following of the film with the same name.

Your girlfriend - she is HOT - spend time with her!\" and Ed I can only take so much, so the illustrations work, it is just the plot, pace, predictable and hard to hold my attention.

This adaptation is horrid. Firstly, the drawing is shit. Secondly, they add and omit things randomly when the script is a piece of art the way it is self-referential and mirrors itself and to mess with perfection is something an idiot would do. Plus, without Edgar Wright's directing, it loses something, this is distinctly a movie and should remain as such.
