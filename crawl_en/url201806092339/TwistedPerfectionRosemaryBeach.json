I can\u2019t walk away from her, I tried. I\u2019m hooked.\u201d    Each book from Abbi Glines is more addictive than the last! I read Twisted Perfection in one sitting and was glued to the page, unable to put it down. It was hot, steamy and sometimes a little dirty *winks*, with a fast-paced plot and lovable characters. It\u2019s a little darker than the Too Far books, but I\u2019d still actually consider it a relatively light read.Having lived her whole life with a mentally ill mother who, out of her personal fears, kept her inside all the time, Della finds her life unexpectedly changed when her mother dies. Three years later, she is still struggling to find herself and decides a road trip is the best answer. So she throws all caution and inhibitions to the wind and heads out. At her first rest stop, she meets Woods.. And ohhhh my do they have chemistry. She isn\u2019t looking to stick around, but she can\u2019t help but take up his offer of dinner\u2026 and more.Woods has enough going on in his life. Too much. He\u2019s being pressured from his family to marry a woman he dislikes for the \u2018good of the family business\u2019. It\u2019s either that, or he loses his part of the business and everything he\u2019s worked towards his whole life. The thought makes him miserable but, he wants the job desperately and so is just trying to delay the inevitable marriage.So when he sees Della at the gas station, he sees perfection. She is exactly what he needs right now. A fun time that would drive away afterwards \u2013 no strings.What neither of them counted on was their hearts getting attached and despite the fact that they both drive off after their night together, fate soon crosses their paths again and this time, they\u2019re not leaving each other.   \u201cMy future was about to be thrown off track because Della Sloane was under my skin and I had to have her.\u201d   Woods. Was. Delicious. Purely delicious!! And yummy. Very yummy. Ohhh and a bit of a dirty talker but he still called her sweetheart right from the start which was super sweet. He was protective and I loved that being around Della brought out his hothead caveman side. It was seriously swoony!I really liked Della. She was broken in many ways but at the same time was really quite free. She may not have been experienced at relationships but she certainly wasn\u2019t shy at going after what she wanted with Woods and I have to say it was refreshing to read her kind of character who on the one hand was like that while at the same time, really messed up inside. It was a cool mix. She had issues, but they didn\u2019t take over every part of her life.I don\u2019t know a better way to describe Abbi\u2019s books than by saying that reading them feels like watching a very well-written, addictive TV show. The scenes, they way their cut together, everything about them just makes me feel like I\u2019m watching it happen right in front of me.This book certainly brings on the angst in certain scenes!! Serious, serious angst. BUT! And here\u2019s what I loved about it: the main angst (at least to me) is resolved in the first half of the book, leaving the second half to be focused quite a bit on Woods and Della sorting their relationship out, which I really enjoyed. That isn\u2019t to say there isn\u2019t angst in the second half, \u2018cuz there is, but it\u2019s a different kind (less nerve wracking, more focused on sorting issues out) and I appreciated the switch up.   \u201cYou are mine. Do you hear me? You are mine, Della Sloane. I will take care of you. Nothing is taking you away from me. Nothing.\u201d   There is a bit of a love \u201csquare\u201d going on for part of the book, but it was clear that Woods was never in love with the girl he was supposed to marry, it was more a question of him falling in love for the first time in his life and being put in position of having to choose \u201chead or heart\u201d? And while Della also connected with another guy she met on her road trip, her heart really always belonged to Woods.That being said, their road to getting together was a fair bit bumpy, but, honestly, it wouldn\u2019t have been nearly as much fun if the ride had been smooth, lol.Della goes through some pretty hard issues in the book and I loved how supportive Woods was of everything. They were just a wonderful couple together.And speaking them as a couple, this book was full of panty-ripping hotness. For real. As I mentioned, Woods has a bit of a dirty mouth and Della just loses it around so they\u2019re a pretty explosive together. Hot, hot, HOT! Lol, sometimes, I\u2019ll admit, it was borderline awkward in places to me, but most just plain freaking hot!And I really have to give a bit of a shout-out to some of the awesome supporting men in this book. First to Tripp, who had better be getting his own damn book cuz that man has SWOON. I want more of him! And then also to Kent, who made my heart melt even though he was only in like two small scenes. Holy heart warming protectiveness!For those of you wondering about cameos, Blaire does have a brief cameo but neither she nor Rush play a central part in the book. As much as I love their characters though, I didn\u2019t miss them here. I was happy to see the book focused on Woods and Della.The ending had me flipping pages like crazy. I knew it would all work out but that didn\u2019t stop me from being worried, lol. You know how it is To soothe your hearts, you should know that there is no relationship cliffhanger! The book ends in a good place relationship-wise. However, this is NOT a stand alone and there will be a sequel out in the fall, so there is a bit of a plot-related cliffy in that something happened at the end to make me want more of the story, but at the same time, it left them in a place where my heart could be happy to wait till the fall. At the end of the book, they are very much together as a couple. So, you will not want to throw your kindle at the wall. It\u2019s all safe!! \u2665See?   \u201cIs she forever for you then? She\u2019s worth throwing it all away?\u201d\u2026\u201cShe\u2019s it. No one else. She\u2019s all I\u2019m ever gonna want.\u201d   I loved the book and totally enjoyed spending my evening wrapped up in this world. Definitely recommended if you are looking for something quick, hot, swoony, slightly angsty, fast-paced and addictive :) 4.5 stars*******************  TOO FAR & PERFECTION SERIES READING ORDER!!!  I know there's been a bit of confusion over these series' reading orders so hopefully this'll answer your questions:Ok, so originally, Twisted Perfection was supposed to be the 3rd book in the TOO FAR series. The first two books were Fallen Too Far and Never Too Far. Those two books followed Rush and Blaire's story and then the original third book (Twisted Perfection) was supposed to be Woods', followed next by Grant's. This all changed when, by popular demand, a third book \"Forever Too Far\" about Rush and Blaire was added to the TOO FAR series. After this change, Abbi Glines then separated the two series. Now, the original series is the TOO FAR series, which now has a spin-off series that Twisted Perfection starts called the PERFECTION series. There will be a sequel to Twisted Perfection coming out this fall called Simple Perfection.I'll list them all here in order so you can see:TOO FAR SERIES - about Rush and Blaire\u2665 #1 Fallen Too Far - out now\u2665 #2 Never Too Far - out now\u2665 #3 Forever Too Far - to be released late Summer 2013PERFECTION SERIES (spin-off of TOO FAR) - about Woods and Della\u2665 #1 Twisted Perfection --> to be released today\u2665 #2 Simple Perfection --> to be released Fall 2013You do not *have* to read the TOO FAR series to understand Twisted Perfection, but the whole world is the same so I'd recommend it if you can. I loved both Fallen Too Far and Never Too Far, so I'd say it would be good to read them, but not necessary.Okay, hopefully that helps clear everything up :)***************************BLURB -->  Life outside of her house was a new experience for Della Sloane. The dark secrets of her past weren\u2019t something she ever intended to share with anyone. They would never understand. No one would ever get close enough to find out. Besides there was always a chance she\u2019d go crazy sooner than they expected\u2026Woods Kerrington had never been one to be attracted to fragile females. They seemed like too much work. He wasn\u2019t in it for the work just the pleasure. A night full of naughty fun had been exactly what was on his mind when he\u2019d laid eyes on the hot little number that didn\u2019t know how to pump gas and needed some help.What he didn\u2019t know was she was as fragile as they came.The carefree girl who spoke her mind and didn\u2019t care what the world thought of her was more breakable than he could ever imagine\u2026 For more of my reviews, visit Aestas Book BlogAnd come join the Aestas Book Blog  Facebook Page"}, {"userName": "Debra", "userReviewDate": "Feb 23, 2013", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/13247178-debra", "userReview": "\"I'll be whatever she needs me to be. I can't walk away from her; I tried. I'm hooked.\"\n ~ WoodsTwisted Perfection was again, an Abbi Glines story that I was unable to put down. It was a fun, sexy and light story that I VERY much enjoyed reading. I'd even go so far as to say that I loved it more than Rush and Blaire's story; mainly because I loved the main characters much, much more...Woods --Della --Della Sloane hasn't always had an easy life. Growing up with a mother who barely led her leave the house and have a social life has made her into a girl who's never had a lot of experience with real life. Now, at the age of nineteen, she's finally decided to let go of her fears and start exploring the world. She decides to take a road trip and discover new things she's never tried out before.\"The only thing we have to fear is fear itself.\"Della tries to be independent but when she has to make a stop to pump gas, she already encounters her first problem: she doesn't know how to pump gas. Luckily, a very helpful guy named Woods shows up and he teaches her how to do it. The two of them feel an instant spark light up between them and since Della has decided to try new things, she agrees to have dinner with him. A few hours later they end up in Woods's truck and have a night of passionate, steaming hot sex.\"I'd wanted to know what good sex was. Now, I knew what earth shattering sex was. Mission accomplished.\" ~ DellaBut they both knew it was just a one-night-stand and the next morning Della moves on with her trip. A while later, she ends up working as a waitress at a bar in Dallas with a guy named Tripp. He becomes her friend and when Della has a some problems with their boss and decides she can't keep working their any longer, Tripp offers to let her stay in his empty condo in the coastal town he grew up in and he even fixes her a job with an old friend of his. Turns out this old friend is no one other than Woods Kerrington...So, four months after their first encounter, Della ends up working at the Kerrington's Golf Club where Woods is the manager and her newfound boss. It's immediately obvious that there's still an attraction between the two of them and their one night stand might have meant much more than either of them is willing to admit. But, Woods is about to be engaged to a girl his father sat up for him and in order to get a more responsible job at the golf club he has to obey his father's commands. Except, he doesn't have any feelings for this girl. Soon, Woods finds himself torn between having to chose between his family and the job he's always dreamed of; and the girl who came rushing into his life and that he hasn't been able to get out of his head ever since.\"My future was about to be completely thrown off track because Della Sloane was under my skin and I had to have her. I couldn't ignore it anymore.\" ~ Woods~*~*~*~*~*~*~*~*~*~*~*~*~*~*~*~*~*~*~*~*~*~*~*~*~I really liked Della. She's a girl who's been through so much in her life already, yet she doesn't come over as weak or dependent at all. She's strong and doesn't complain easily and I really admired that about her. She tries to fight her fears and deal with them rather than to run away and hide. No one has ever really cared about her and with Woods she seems to have finally found someone who gave her affection and made all of her problems fade away. Dark secrets from her past still haunt her to this day but Woods is determined to help her get move past them.\"You are mine. Do you hear me? You are mine, Della Sloane. I will take care of you. Nothing is taking you away from me. Nothing.\"And Woods, although he certainly isn't perfect and did some things that infuriated me a little, it's kind of hard not to swoon over him. I already loved him in the previous books about Rush and Blaire, but now I LOVE him even more! He's always sweet, responsible, protective and trying to take care of everyone. And well, let's face it, he's HOT. I wouldn't have expected it from him based on what we got to know about him from Rush and Blaire's story but damn, the man has a dirty mouth. And I loved it!!\"I want to be inside you again, Della. I want to pull this sexy ass excuse of a skirt up and bury myself in the tightest pussy I've ever been in.\"\n\"Every time I'm inside of you is making love, baby. Every damn time.\"At first their relationship is purely based on a physical attraction but after a while, it becomes about much more than that. Once Woods gets to know the real Della, he sees that she's special and worth fighting for. He's never felt that way about anyone before and although Della isn't perfect, neither is he, and it's exactly those imperfections that make them perfect for each other... \"Not everyone sees you the way you do. Sometimes our imperfections are what makes us special.\"\"Woods made me whole. He healed everything that was wrong with me. Having him this close to me was all I would ever need.\" ~ Della\"She's it. No one else. She's all I'm ever gonna want.\" ~ Woods\nAlthough the ending did surprise me a little, I wouldn't exactly call it a cliffhanger. It did end in a way I think will have some major consequences for the rest of the story and that made me very curious what will happen next, but I certainly wouldn't let the ending keep you from giving this first part of the series a try.I already know I'll be looking forward to reading much more about Della and Woods in the next part of this enticing series!!!\"I don't want to destroy you,\" she whispered. \"Losing you would be the only thing that could destroy me.\"\n\n\"I had a life with Woods to look forward to I knew I could fight whatever darkness that tried to take me. Before Woods I didn't know what I was living for. In my search to find myself, I'd found so much more. I knew now why I wanted to live. I understood love. I had found it.\"\n4.5 STARS."}, {"userName": "xrysa", "userReviewDate": "Feb 16, 2013", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/9016476-xrysa", "userReview": "[Should I be happy that he died??

I am an Abbi Glines fan girl. She is one of my favorite YA/NA authors. Everything of hers is amazing, so I wasn\u2019t surprised with how much I loved this... It was by far her hottest book to date! And Woods is just too hot to handle!!!!\n\nWe all know and love Woods from the \u2018Too Far\u2019 series, now lets meet Della...\nDella had a very strange and difficult childhood. Her mother had a lot of mental issues, and she was kept indoors a lot. She lived a very sheltered life, and still has flashbacks and nightmares from her childhood. Della is 19 now. She has her freedom. She recently got her license, and is on the road to find her self, travel, live life. \nShe doesn\u2019t get very far before she has a problem. She doesn\u2019t know how to pump gas, and her car is out. Thankfully, she meets Woods at the gas station. He is more than happy to help her out. Della and Woods go out to dinner that night. After dinner, Della decides to take a chance. Woods is hot, he seems nice, and he wants her. She is not very experienced, but thats what this trip is about. New experiences. No time is wasted... within the first 8% of this book, you will get some smoking hot sex in Woods\u2019 truck. \nI\u2019d wanted to know what good sex was. Now, I knew what earth shattering sex was. Mission accomplished.\nAfter one earth shattering night, Della is on her way. She lands in Dallas. There, she meets a bartender named Tripp that she becomes friends with. After some problems with her boss, Della leaves Dallas. Tripp offers her to stay at his condo for a while. He knows a guy that can give her a job. Mr. Kerrington. Della accepts, and to her surprise- Mr. Kerrington is Woods.Woods is more than a little shocked to see Della several months after their encounter. She has been on his mind. He wants her, but he knows he should stay away. He is getting ready to become an engaged man. He doesn\u2019t want to be, but his father is forcing him if he wants his part of the family business. Woods is pretty torn up about it, but he\u2019s doing what he has to do.\nI wasn\u2019t sure if I\u2019d ever be able to forgive him for this. Or maybe it was me I would never be able to forgive. What man let another man control his life? His future?\nDella isn\u2019t happy about the situation, but she tries to just work for Woods and be his friend. Then, Tripp comes home for a bit. He has feelings for Della and Woods kind of loses it. He wants her no matter what the consequences are. He wants to be there for her, protect her, take care of her. Della is freaked by this. She isn\u2019t the most stable person, she has terrible nightmares, she doesn\u2019t feel good enough for Woods. Woods doesn\u2019t care about any of that. He knows the real Della. He has never felt this way about anyone before. She is it for him.\n\n\u2018You are mine. Do you hear me? You are mine, Della Sloane. I will take care of you. Nothing is taking you away from me. Nothing.\u2019\n\n\nLOVED this book! Della is a strong female lead. Even though she has some issues, she is doing the best she can. She is very likable. And oh dear god Woods... In the \u2018too far\u2019 books, I had a Rush Crush. This book had me saying Rush who? Woods- loved his kind, sweet, protective, and understanding nature. Staying the night for Della\u2019s nightmares had me seriously swooning. And Woods was so freaking hot... \nPoison's \u2018Talk Dirty to Me\u2019 was going through my head for a lot of this book. I loved Wood\u2019s and his dirty mouth. \n\u201cI want to be inside you again, Della. I want to pull this sexy ass excuse for a skirt up and bury myself in the tightest pussy I\u2019ve ever been in.\u201d\nDella and Woods were great together. Loved them as a couple. \nI\u2019ve heard a lot of people say that this book ended in a cliffhanger- I really didn\u2019t think so... Yes, something big happened at the end, and its something that will effect the next book- but its nothing compared to the Blaire/Rush cliffhanger so don\u2019t let it stop you from reading!I really loved this book. I was happy to see a lot of the old crew- and I really liked Tripp... wouldn\u2019t mind if he got a book of his own! Strongly disliked Woods' parents... no surprise there. It was nice to get a Blaire cameo as well. If you liked the \u2018Too Far\u2019 series, or if you are an Abbi fan like me, you will LOVE THIS! And if you haven\u2019t read anything by her, what the hell are you waiting for?!?! Her books are awesome. The fall can\u2019t come soon enough... I NEED MORE WOODS!!!\n\nIf I had a life with Woods to look forward to I knew I could fight whatever darkeness that tried to take me. Before Woods I didn\u2019t know what I was living for.

And thank goodness it did not take the whole book for this realization to take place.*wipes sweat from forehead in relief* I felt and knew exactly why Woods wanted the V.P. job; not only was it his birth right but he bust his butt to get it. And his father had the audacity to basically blackmail him. WTF? I wanted to BITCH SLAP his dad. He was a callous prick. And his mother was no better. *sighs sadly* Poor Woods :(Della.Della Della Della, this girl has experienced a lot of pain. We get small doses of her sorrow in flashback memories and it is a scary picture that was revealed. I have no idea how one copes with such tragedy or how one deals with a mother so unstable.

She looked like a great one-night stand.He looked like an amazing few hours of freedom.Tomorrow, he\u2019d leave and go and become the person he was supposed to be.She\u2019d wake up and continue being the person she was determined not to be.And then they weren\u2019t ever supposed to see each other again.But Woods was never far from Della\u2019s thoughts. For the next couple of months when she was off experiencing life and experiencing sunburned smiles and doorslam heartbreaks\u2026 that one night of uninhibited freedom meant more to her than he\u2019d ever know.But she was about to find out that she was as unforgettable as he was.Because now she\u2019s back at Rosemary Beach and is walking in for a job interview with Mr. Kerrington, where she runs right smack into Woods\u2026 Kerrington.Her new boss.  \u2666 I needed to put her sexy ass on another continent. But I was about to give her a job. Here at my club. So I could be tortured with the memory of our night amazing, mind-blowing sex.Ah, hell. \u2666 \nDella needed the job, and Woods needed the help. But what he didn\u2019t need was the distraction and the constant reminder of what he couldn\u2019t have. And he couldn\u2019t have Della Sloane. No matter how hard he wanted her, he also knew that he had a life to live up to in his father\u2019s cold and hard-driven eyes. His father would only accept the best of life and luxury and soft-hearted Della didn\u2019t fit into the life that had always been blue-printed for Woods.But no matter how hard he fought it, he couldn\u2019t fight the attraction.They couldn\u2019t fight it.\n\n \u2666 \u201cWoods, please,\u201d I begged.He lifted his head, and the look in his hooded eyes told me he was as turned on as I was. I loved that tasting me did this to him.\u201cAre you gonna come in my mouth?\u201d he asked, sticking out his tongue and running it from my opening to my swollen clit.\u201cI need to,\u201d I panted.\u201cThis pretty little pussy needs to come?\u201d he asked, taking another long, leisurely lap with his tongue. I squirmed and whimpered.He reached up and covered my mouth with his hand before pulling my clit into his mouth and shoving two fingers into my soaking entrance. His fingers pumped into me as his tongue flicked my clit and sucked on it. My scream was smothered by his hand. \u2666 \n\nAnd soon that ignited passion turns into something neither of them could have ever saw coming.;Something life-altering;Something wishful and starless:Love.\n\n \u2666 I love him. I can\u2019t love him,\u201d I said quietly. \u2666 \n\nBut the thing is\u2026\u2666 Della\u2019s storming memories are catching up to them.\n\n \u2666 \u201cWere you outside, Della? How could you? What do I have to do to get it throught your head that you can\u2019t go outside? It\u2019s dangerous out there.\u201d The shrill screech of my mother\u2019s voice was nothing like the searing pain from the leather belt that she slashed across my legs. I new not to cry out in pain. She\u2019d only get angrier.My knees buckled as the tender skin behind them tore open from the continuous hit of the leather. \u2666 \n\n\nAnd Wood\u2019s future is right behind them.\u2666\n\n \u2666 Della Sloane would cause me to lose it all. \u2666 \n\nAnd though they couldn\u2019t fight their attraction for the other\u2026Choices will have to be made.\n\n \u2666 \u201cIf you love my son, and I believe in that unstable brain of yours that you think you do, you will leave him alone. Let him go. He doesn\u2019t need this or you. He needs someone who can give him healthy children. Someone he doesn\u2019t have to take care of. Don\u2019t you want that for him?\u201dI did. I wanted all of that for him. \u2666"}, {"userName": "BookHeroin ", "userReviewDate": "Mar 09, 2013", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/11352319-bookheroin", "userReview": "[he dies so YAAAAY.

I've loved all of Abbi's books, and all my expectations were once again fulfilled with Twisted Perfection It's such a wonderful story. I was so excited to read about Woods and Della, two very different people, from different worlds, who meet, fall in love and change each other for the better. As always with Abbi I simply get sucked in from page one, this wasn't any different. I couldn't put this book down and I just kept needing more and more. The story was perfectly paced for what needed to be told. The chemistry between Woods and Della is palpable, and you just feel it. This is the thing that I've found with Abbi's books Twisted Perfection included you FEEL everything! You do, you just feel it. Abbi has a way of telling her stories, and it comes out in her writing and it's just wonderful. (This is a gushing review, I'm sorry).There were just so many great moments to be had, and I'm so in love with Woods that I honestly didn't know I could love him more than I thought I already did. He's pretty much an Alpha male like more of Abbi's boys are, and he's so fiercely protective of Della, but not in the sadistic way. His and Della's relationship was pretty well thought out, starting from a one night stand, to eventually a chance meeting 4 months on and then eventually falling deeper and deeper in love. It wasn't a slow progression but it wasn't instant either which is great because it totally worked.Just going to touch on the ending a little. It was actually pretty perfect, it wasn't an ending I was expecting so it came as a little bit of 'whoa' moment for me; but it was a good ending, most may think it's a cliffhanger, I thought it was to begin with, but on a re-think and having met Abbi personally it's not a cliffhanger it's a nice pause to introduce the 2nd part of their story coming in late Autumn. It'll take you back, but it's worth it.I can't really fault anything in Twisted Perfection, I honestly can't, and I don't know if that's because I'm biased because I'm in love with Abbi (such a girl crush) or because there just because I get so enthralled in the story that I completely miss anything off key, I don't know. What I do know is, that Twisted Perfection was a fabulous read, one that I will re-read over and again. I can never get enough of Abbi and her books filled with bad boys and intense passion with hot monkey sex, that I plan to read everything she writes. So if you basically haven't read her Too Far series yet, you should I think pick that up and it's sequel and then read Twisted Perfection. I promise you won't regret it. I anxiously (impatiently) await Woods and Della's sequel Simple Perfection. I. Can't. Wait!\u201cI loved her. I loved her with a something so fierce I couldn't even name it.\u201d -Woods\u201cYou are mine. Do you hear me? You are mine, Della Sloane. I will take care of you. Nothing is taking you away from me. Nothing.\u201d-Woods\u201cIf I had a life with Woods to look forward to I knew I could fight whatever darkness that tried to take me. Before Woods, I didn\u2019t know what I was living for. In my search to find myself, Id found so much more. I knew now why I wanted to live. I understood love.

She has lived through horrors and she lives with the fear that she has inherited her mother's mental illness. She is giving, caring, beautiful and strong. She is on a road trip to learn how to live.

And I didn\u2019t even know his last name.\nHe made me tingle, blush and swoon. But he has a father who is a royal asshat. The only way Woods can get his promotion is to marry Angelina who is a heiress of the Graystone empire. I loved that we got Wood's perspective in every other chapter!

I LOVE this cover! Woods is smokin'!!2. Woods' protectiveness/possessiveness/caring ways for Della3. Della and Woods' drama doesn't last long4. This book flows fast5. Tripp. How can you NOT love this guy?? 6. Woods is a naughty boy in this one ;)7. Grant-I still have a soft spot for him. Jace is still a good guy. Thad is still an idiot. lol8. Della- she may have some demons that still haunt her, but she's not a whiny, typical floozy that cares only about Woods money and what he can do for her. Woods, Woods, Woods... he is stuck with a controlling father in a loveless parent/child relationship with his parents. He is more like a business transaction for his father and does his bidding. His parents, but more actively his father, want him to marry Angelina Greystone so they can link their family business names together. Woods just wants to find happiness, real love and not be forced in to a loveless marriage just for employment gain. He meets Della one night at a gas station when he sees that she's clueless on how to pump gas. They hit it off and eventually he can't get her off his mind. He's got this intense pull to have her, claim her, possess her and keep her safe. This starts the push and need for Woods to change his life around and stop being someone else's puppet. \n\"I'll be whatever she needs me to be. I can't walk away from her, I tried. I'm hooked...\"\nDella, Della, Della... she is emotionally damaged by the life of her crazy mother. She's just barely beginning to figure out who she is and how to live life outside of her home. She has demons that haunt her dreams and words that can trigger things. She seems carefree and unbreakable but in reality, she's fragile deep down. She meets Woods one night before heading to Dallas for a bit. She gets mixed up in a relationship that goes South and her co-worker sends her off to a small coastal town to regroup. Little does she know shes about to meet Woods' BFF and hope for a job at his country club. She is very attracted to Woods and has this intense need to be with him. He's her safe harbor. If she can feel him, hear him and take in his smell it calms her and brings her back to reality.These two go through some bumps together: his parents, her demons, Angelina, and his need to do what he feels is right. Woods was a man POSSESSED and  DESPERATE to have Della. I wouldn't say this book ends on a cliffhanger per se... however, I do think the way it ends can wreck havoc on the couple in the next book. Can they weather that storm when faced to deal with it?Examples of Woods needing to claim/possess Della and his desperation:\"She was curled up on the bed in a small ball. Like she was protecting herself. My hoodie swallowed her but she held it tightly against her just like Tripp had said. Seeing her in my sweatshirt like that had the caveman in me pounding his chest. She was mine.\"\"Don't leave me, Della.\"\"You are mine. Do you hear me? You are mine, Della Sloane. I will take care of you. Nothing is taking you away from me. Nothing.\" \"I love you, Della.

Why? The short answer ~ No book butterflies this time. I've gushed about Abbi Glines before in previous reviews, and YES I'm about to do it again. This author is all about her characters, storyline and her books are like Pringles (once you pop, you just cant stop)! How she grabs me so completely with her story lines - is a mystery.This book was a real treat, Abbi one of my BEZZIE authors has created yet again a story of HUGE, likeable proportions. Her writing style is so easy peasy before you know it you've read a whole book and waiting for more ...So my thoughts on twisted perfection ...I think we all anticipated we would be ga- ga over Woods, since he stole our hearts in the 'Fallen too Far' series. So it came to no surprise to me that I Loved this character, that's not to say he was delivered without fault - OH NO, there were times I wanted to jump right in my kindle to have a few choice words! With that being said I was sold on his character from the start. Hello, Hot hot HAAAAWT dirty talker. Yes this book delivered hot to the touch STEAM curtesy of our book hero. Our leading heroine is a beautiful package, a young independent woman, dealing with the ghosts of her past and Moving forward with her future. I liked her a lot. I thought there was a Fabulous connection between these two loveables.This book was a little more gritty and saddening than Glines usual style but I liked it. I felt engaged and connected with the story from page one. As with most of Abbi Glines books she delivers great sub characters, I'm desperado for a book about Tripp and I love how the authors includes friends and family making her stories more complete.All in all a big thumbs up from this reader, I'd never let an Abbi Glines book pass me by and I'm more than eager for the follow up to this story, not quite left on a cliff hanger, but close enough to have reader chomping at the bit ...

I have to say that this book also was a disappointment, with a few shiny ups. But sadly, it bored me more often then not. I ended up DNF it sadly.Woods has always been the character that stood out for me, bright and shiny, so I really had high hopes for this book. I\u00b4m sad to say I was let down. Especially Della was a dull and boring character, she just seemed flat to me. I felt no connection to her at all. Her story was, I\u00b4m sure, supposed to be heartbreaking but it didn\u00b4t move me at all. The second half of the book was good, but nothing to write home about. And Woods deeply disappponted me. He was the star in the two first books of the Too Far series. I instantly loved him in book one. Turned out in this he was just another horn dog and a daddy's doormat :(Abbi Glines\u00b4s books are the kinds you read one afternoon in the sun, or in between really great books. I was very impressed with the first book by her, I read, Never Too Far. It has gone downhill from there. It is just something missing from her books.

This giveaway is INTERNATIONAL 4 STARS I was really looking forward to Twisted Perfection by Abbi Glines. I loved Woods in the Too Far Series and was ecstatic that he was getting his own book, giving me the chance to indulge in his story. Let me tell you that Woods is HOT. I was stunned by how dirty and pervy he was. As I started reading one of my first thoughts was \u201cHOLY CRAP!! Is this an Abbi Glines book?\u201d!! It\u2019s sizzling and steamy right from the start and really doesn't slow down much. Woods is possessive and extremely alpha. He has a dirty mouth that made me at times blush. I\u2019m not sure what I was expecting going in but I was definitely surprised by the sexual explosiveness and intensity it had. Abbi writes books that are absolutely addicting. Once you\u2019ve read an Abbi Glines book you\u2019ll be hooked for life. There\u2019s absolutely no turning back. Her books are like crack and her characters always hit very close to home. They\u2019re always relatable and lovable. She has a knack with pulling the readers in and in Twisted Perfection it was no different. You can expect a quick read with hot, intense and swoony characters. Della is so broken. She\u2019s a shattered girl trying to find herself in a world she has no idea how to live in. After a torturous childhood Della is given the opportunity by her best friend to go out into the world and \u201cfind herself.\u201d She needs to learn to be independent and to find some sort of freedom from a childhood that haunts her every moment. Della just wants to have fun and experience all the ups and downs that go with a normal life. She wants to learn how to LIVE!Woods is working hard to take over the family business. He want the top job and feels he\u2019s owed it. In order to get where he wants to go he has to make sacrifices. His father has a plan and Woods has to stick with it in order to get what he wants. Woods is tired of someone always controlling his life but being successful is the most important thing to him until he meets Della.When Della and Woods lay eyes on each other it\u2019s LUST at first sight. Della is passing through town and needs to stop and get gas. She meets Woods and a scorching one night stand happens that leaves a long lasting impression on them both. A couple month\u2019s later when Della has to return to town after an unfortunate situation occurred she meets Woods again and sparks fly. The attraction is UNDENIABLE and the chemistry is ADDICTIVE. They can\u2019t stay or keep their hands off each other. But Della has a mountain of issues and Woods has some problems of his own. These two have a lot to work through before anything long lasting could ever truly happen. It\u2019s an angsty hot mess but one that works brilliantly.Overall I really liked the book. The only thing I wished was that the pacing was slowed down a tad and that the characters were a little more developed. Other than that I still felt that Abbi kept us on the edge of our seats waiting to find out what Woods was going to do and what Della\u2019s secrets were. The ending is......well another cliffhanger but in my honest opinion it\u2019s NOTHING that should hold you back from reading the book. I can\u2019t wait to see what happens in the next book Simple Perfection. Woods and Della are amazing together.\nMY WOODS\n\nFollow Me On --->>\nMY BLOG LINK -->> Angie's Dreamy ReadsBLOG FACEBOOK LINK --->> Facebook - Angie's Dreamy Reads"}, {"userName": "Sharon \u221e\u2765 is an emotional book junkie \u2765\u221e ", "userReviewDate": "Feb 15, 2013", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/3275325-sharon-is-an-emotional-book-junkie", "userReview": "I'm not sure about Twisted but Woods sure was Perfection....on a stick! I was looking forward to Woods' story because you just knew it would be good especially with the way Woods takes care of people and he's just so intense! AG did not disappoint. Della was innocent and sweet...I even wanted to help her. It really was quite hard to hear everything that she went through and is still working out. I loved how much Woods took care of her. They both really fill that spot that the other needs so well. And Woods' Dad? I wanted to smack him up the head after he left her the first time (and what he did after)! What a Class A Jerk!! Okay...back to Woods...did I mention he was hot? Holy Cow & Sweet Mother of all that is holy HOT. After the first night with him, I don't know how Della actually left but I'm glad she came back. I loved her complete abandonment when it came to Woods and I LOVED Woods' dirty mouth! But he also said some of the sweetest, most romantic things! And I loved when he was trying to get to know her and asking her all the questions! Woods and Della have some extremely steamy scenes. I seriously didn't think he could top Rush but I just think he might have. WOW...and I think this book was much more sexual than Rush's or maybe it was just the Woodsgasm I kept having! And OMG....let's talk Tripp shall we? Can AG possibly put anymore hot, yummy guys into these books? I want a Tripp book...or two or three. Seriously, she can't just tease us with him and leave us hanging! Let me just say one thing....I KNEW it about Grant!! But please, please, please let that be the end of it. I know that AG said she doesn't like Nan either but I just couldn't handle that. I was happy with the Blaire scene but no Rush?? What was up with that?? It was a bit disappointing and I would have liked some interaction between Blaire and Woods...that would have been really good.I really enjoyed Braden and Della's relationship. It's so complex and interesting that I really wanted more but hopefully that will come in the next book. And I loved how Kent was so accepting and protective!

Just appreciate that he is NOT the widespread kind, he cares about money, and he work his breath out to make it by himself.He doesn\u2019t rely on any person in command that is so important to the story.\u266b\u2665\u266b\u2665\u266b\u2665\u266b\u2665\u266b\u2665\u266b\u2665\u266b\u2665\u266b\u2665\u266b\u2665\u266b\u2665\u266b\u2665\u266b\u2665\u266b\u2665\u266b\u2665\u266b\u2665\u266b\u2665\u266b\u2665\u266b\u2665\u266b\u2665\u266b\u2665\u266b\u2665Woods wants Della, but because he has his intellectual set on taking through the family business,\n\nHe can't have her.\n\nWoods & Della story starts in reverse. They approached together at a gas stattion, had a very tepid one night time stand and not ever glimpsed each other afresh until Della comes back in settlement and commences engaged in work for Woods. That's when sizzle, sparks and love happened.They had numerous sombre chemistry. Della yearns intimacy. It earns her seem nice towards be hugged to be cuddled and touched. And when it comes to Woods she her urge for having more of him intensified. And I would be lying is I say that it wasn't as HOT as it sounds ;)There lives are so oddly rotated and strong. Woods really appear hard for Della and it brandished with his actions.\n\u201cYou're it for me, baby. Just you. You're not going to be your mother. You're special and unique and we're going to get you help. But I will be right by your side the entire time. I'll never leave you.

I want to pull this sexy ass excuse of a skirt up and bury myself in the tightest pussy I've ever been in.\"We'll have a glimpse of his possessive ccaveman perimeter which I wasn't looking ahead to but denounce, he can play-act caveman anytime he wants!\"Every time I'm inside of you is making love, baby.

Twisted Perfection isn't a hearts and flowers kind of romance. This book deals with some serious issues.\"I don't want to destroy you,\" she whispered. \"Losing you would be the only thing that could destroy me.\"your heart drubbing a bit much quicker, tears gnawing your eyes, and you'll find yourself swooning and squeeing..I\u2019m delighted with where Woods and Della are at the end of this book and it districts higher for what is definite to be another many written material for them.It had a many behind written material which adjoined so much extent down to it.

I was actually surprised when I learned that Abbi did not really plan on writing a story for Woods had fans not requested.Woods is the MAN! No matter how little 'screentime' he got from FTF and NTF he always manages to shine.I'd be honest, at some point in time in FtF I actually wanted Blaire to end up with Woods.LOLGlad at how things worked out in NTF and Woods safe from a broken heart.The rest is now in Ms. Glines hand, I know she'd do right by Woods."}, {"userName": "Anna", "userReviewDate": "Feb 15, 2013", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/6744426-anna", "userReview": "4 Get Wooed by Woods ~ stars !!!

I cant believe it!!!!! I am so happy right now!!!!!! I was so happy when I found out that there is going to be a book about Woods. I loved him in Never Too Far and Fallen Too Far. I liked him so much better than Rush already then. Now after reading his story I can only state yet again that I love him. He was a great guy who put Della first, and his protectiveness and possessiveness was definitely a turn on. Well I have to admit that I have HUGE crush on him now ;DThe story was hot and intense, their connection felt almost palpable. However, at the same time, Dellas struggle with the memories of her past and Woods struggle with his own inner conflicts made the story heartbreaking and inspirational. I loved every damn part of this book. Abbi Glines did not disappoint me and the story was exactly like I expected it to be I cannot wait for the next part, and I know I am gonna be rereading this a lot ;D"}], "description": "Life outside of her house was a new experience for Della Sloane.
