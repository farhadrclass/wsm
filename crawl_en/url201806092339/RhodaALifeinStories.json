Her characters are all sexy, funny, and generally unrealistic in a number of ways, but so fun to read about. I adore Rhoda; she is witty, promiscuous, and downright hilarious. Nothing too deep her, but a lot of fun to read."}, {"userName": "Nicole", "userReviewDate": "Jun 25, 2008", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/1019242-nicole", "userReview": "I dont even want to give this book a star. If half a star was a option I would select that. I was ready to meet a exciting redhead southern firecracker bad girl with personality and sass and someone you want to be. Disappointing is not the correct word. First I didnt like that this is pieces of the \"Rhoda\" character from youth to old age so the story doesnt flow. Then the actual character is someone I simply do not care for, at all. I remember repeatly saying I dont like this woman, I still dont like this person, I would not want to be around this one. The character was self centered, immature, and Ill stop right there. It took me twice as long to finish this book because I was not engaged. Toward the end there was some small parts that were borderline OK but Im surprised I didnt give up in the beginning like I wanted to. She wasnt even so bad that she fell into the \"love to hate\" category. If you ask me, dont waste your time with this one. Good thing I got it from a free swap of I would get a refund."}, {"userName": "Pat", "userReviewDate": "May 27, 2014", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/14015862-pat", "userReview": "An all-time favorite character."}, {"userName": "Nf", "userReviewDate": "May 27, 2017", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/11732664-nf", "userReview": "It was a good book, short stories, my favorite. I was about to donate until I came to \"The Uninsured\" at the end of the book. These letters were way before Obamacare and health care reformation(1993). I'm not keeping the entire book, but I am taking these pages out for some noble purpose, not sure what yet. She kind of said FU to the insurance companies until Medicare kicks in. Kind of brave until you realize, she has some money and is very healthy. Of course, her pre-existing condition of psychotherapy does give her insurance companies cause to ponder. That is one thing we no longer have to fear, at leats until 2018."}, {"userName": "Deb (Readerbuzz) Nance", "userReviewDate": "Jul 25, 2009", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/1654645-deb-readerbuzz-nance", "userReview": "I zipped through Rhoda yesterday and  today and ended up liking Rhoda even  more than Dreamy Dreams. Linked stories,  with the same main character, almost a novel  but not quite, is a fun idea. Even the little  discrepancies between the stories  (Just how old was Rhoda when she first got  married, anyway? She is said to be twenty  and nineteen and seventeen in various stories)  add a feeling of authenticity to the book  (Do you always remember just how old you  were when you got married? I sometimes tell  different people different ages.)  Gilchrist's writing has a Hemingwayish feel  to it, especially when she has Rhoda begin to  write and when she has Rhoda fall in love.  I loved Rhoda when she was a fearless child,  was saddened by her in her twenties as she  seemed to let life carry her along, but  fell back in love with this character when  she hit her fifties and began to be courageous  again (I really really wanted her to meet up  with the bullfighter...oh well.) Wonderful book."}, {"userName": "Kristy Engel", "userReviewDate": "Feb 07, 2017", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/7889496-kristy-engel", "userReview": "How in God's name do so many people find Rhoda to be such a wonderful character?! How have so many people rated this book so high? I hated Rhoda. I kept trying to like her, but with each story I just hated her more and more. I wanted to slap her...or for SOMEONE to slap her. I didn't like the writing style either. It was choppy and not just because of the format of the book. This was given to me by a friend who loved it and I had high expectations, but it sure was a hard one to get to the end of."}, {"userName": "Megan", "userReviewDate": "May 13, 2010", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/135858-megan", "userReview": "This was a letdown for me. The first story was one of the best things I have read ever. Rhoda is a totally hilarious, spunky, and unapologetic 8 year old with a serious ax to grind. I had such high hopes. But this collection of short stories goes quickly downhill from there. As an adult Rhoda is whiny, irritating, and crass, with believable but thoroughly unentertaining arrested development issues. With all of the ridiculous talk about her sex life (and accompanying crass vocabulary) I would expect this book to have been written by a man. I just have a few stories left but I'm struggling to finish it. My one hope is that she dies some kind of hilarious and wittily narrated death, which would be the only way Rhoda could redeem herself to me."}, {"userName": "Pat", "userReviewDate": "Apr 20, 2014", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/2111767-pat", "userReview": "Ellen Gilchrist has skillfully interwoven stories that chronicle the life of Rhoda Manning from early adolescence to late middle age. Rhoda is the very definition of a narcissistic personality thrroughout her self-absorbed life, leaving in her wake bewilderment and harm to her husbands and children in her quest for immediate gratification. This book is very well written with a main character who is memorable for her lack of any redeeming qualities."}, {"userName": "Aime", "userReviewDate": "Jul 30, 2014", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/10825911-aime", "userReview": "I liked this book much more in the 2nd half than I did the first. While Rhoda is pretty crazy, I like the message that she finally gets to...which is to be happy with yourself.3 stars because I wasn't in love with the format.

Rhoda was truly a cantankerous, almost hateful little girl. She grew into adolescence as someone who needed to be the center of things. Everything was all about her. In her adulthood, Rhoda became a tamed, yet accomplished, woman who managed to tie together all the past-life episodes into one person.
