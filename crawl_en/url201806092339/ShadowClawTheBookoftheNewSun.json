Keely", "userReviewDate": "Sep 24, 2007", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/84023-j-g-keely", "userReview": "Wolfe has an almost legendary status amongst fellow authors; Gaiman called him 'a ferocious intellect', Swanwick said he's \"the greatest writer in the English language alive today\", and Disch called this series \"a tetralogy of couth, intelligence, and suavity\".You can rarely trust the popular market to single out good authors, but you'd think it might be safe to listen to the opinions of other writers (especially an assemblage of Nebula and Hugo winners in their own right). I will give his fans one concession: Wolfe is an author who defies expectations. Unfortunately, I was expecting him to be remarkable and interesting.This book had been sitting on my shelf for months, along with other highly-praised works I've been looking forward to, but I bade my time, waiting for the mood to strike. Few live up to their reputation, but most at least deliver part of the promise.I would expect any author mentioned in the same breath as Peake to have an original and vibrant style, but I found Wolfe's writing to be simple without being elegant. His language and structure serves its purpose, only occasionally rising above mere utilitarianism, and then he rushes to florid flourishes that fall flat as often as they succeed. Sometimes, it is downright dull. The prose of the second book is stronger than the first, but its plot and characters are more linear and predictable.I appreciated his 'created language' more than most fantasy authors, but I didn't find it particularly mysterious or difficult, because all of his words are based on recognizable Germanic or Romantic roots. Then again, after three years of writing stories about Roman whores in Latin, I had little problem with 'meretriculous'. Even those words I wasn't familiar with seemed clear by their use.The terms are scattered throughout the book, but rarely contribute to a more pervasive linguistic style, as might be seen in The Worm Ouroboros, The Lord of the Rings, Gormenghast, or The King of Elfland's Daughter. Wolfe's terms pepper otherwise and unremarkable modern style, which hardly helps to throw us into a strange world.He is better than the average fantasy author, but he resembles them more than he differs from them. His protagonist started off interestingly enough: an apparently weak and intelligent man, which made it all the more disappointing when he suddenly transformed into a laconic, wench-loving buttkicker who masters sword-fighting, finds the Super Magic Thing and follows the path of his Awesome Foretold Fate. Again, I must agree with Nick Lowe: Wolfe's plot owes more to magic and convenience than good storytelling.It relies on the same tricks over and over: any time a character is about to give important information to us, there will be a sudden attack or other interruption, as convenient and annoying as the moment when the dying man says \"I was killed by . . . aargh\". We also get problems solved by divine intervention whenever things start to slow, which doesn't leave the characters much room to be active.He also seems to suffer from the same sexual discomfort that plagues so many fantasy authors. There is an undercurrent of obsession with women and their sexuality, complete with the sexualization of rape and murder. It's not so much a case of misogyny as it is an inequality in how characters behave.The women always seem to end up as playtoys for the narrator, running around naked, desiring him, sparring with him coyly, but ultimately, conquered; and the camera pans away. They always approach him, desire him, pretending they don't want him, then give themselves up to him. It's the same old story of an awkward, emotionless male protagonist who is inexplicably followed and harangued by women who fall in love with him for no given reason, familiar to anyone who's seen a harem anime.I will grant that the women have more character than the average fantasy heroine, but it still doesn't leave them with much. Instead of giving into love at first sight, they fight it as long as they can, making it that much sweeter when the narrator finally 'wins'. The sexuality was not new, interesting, arousing, or mutual, it was merely the old game of 'overcoming the strong woman' that is familiar to readers of the Gor books. The sense of 'love' in The New Sun is even more unsettling. It descends on the characters suddenly and nonsensically, springing to life without build or motivation. The word never comes up in connection with any psychological development, nor does it ever seem to match the relationships as they are depicted. More often than not, it seems love is only mentioned so the narrator can coldly break his lover's trust in the next chapter.Several times, the narrator tries to excuse himself for objectifying women by mentioning that he also objectifies ugly women. What this convolution of misogyny is supposed to represent, I couldn't say. The narrator seems very interested in this fact, and is convinced that it makes him a unique person. It made it very clear to me why the most interesting antiheroes tend to be gruff and laconic, because listening to a chauvinistic sociopath talk about himself is insufferable.Then there is the fact that every character you meet in the story turns up again, hundreds of miles away, to reveal that they are someone else and have been secretly controlling the action of the plot. It feels like the entire world is populated by about fifteen people who follow the narrator around wherever he goes. If the next two books continue along the same lines, then the big reveal will be that the world is entirely populated by no more than three superpowered shapeshifters.Everyone in the book has secret identities, secret connections to grand conspiracies, and important plot elements that they conveniently hide until the last minute, only doling out clues here and there. There are no normal people in this world, only double agents and kings in disguise. Every analysis I've read of this book mentions that even the narrator is unreliable.This can be an effective technique, but in combination with a world of infinite, unpredictable intrigue, Wolfe's story begins to evoke something between a soap opera and a convoluted mystery novel, relying on impossible and contradictory scenarios to mislead the audience. Apparently, this is the thing his fans most appreciate about him--I find it to be an insulting and artificial game.I agree with this reviewer that there is simply not enough structure to the story to make the narrator's unreliability meaningful. In order for unreliable narration to be effective, there must be some clear and evident counter-story that undermines it. Without that, it is not possible to determine meaning, because there's nowhere to start: everything is equally shaky.At that point, it's just a trick--adding complexity to the surface of the story without actually producing any new meaning. I know most sci fi and fantasy authors seem to love complexity for its own sake, but it's a cardinal sin of storytelling: don't add something into your story unless it needs to be there. Covering the story with a lot of vagaries and noise may impress some, but won't stand up to careful reading.Fantasy novels are often centered on masculinity, violence, and power struggles, and so by making the narrator an emotionally distant manipulator with sociopathic tendencies, Wolfe's story is certainly going to resemble other genre outings. If Severian is meant to be a subversion of the grim antihero, I would expect a lot of clever contradiction which revealed him. His unreliability would have to leave gaping holes that point to another, more likely conclusion. If the protagonist's mendacious chauvinism is not soundly contradicted, then there is really nothing separating him from what he is supposed to be mocking.Poe's Law states that it can be difficult to tell whether something is an act of mockery or an example of genuine extremism, and perhaps that's what's going on here: Wolfe's mockery is so on-the-nose that it is indistinguishable from other cliche genre fantasy. But even if that were true, then the only thing separating Wolfe from the average author is the fact that he's doing it on purpose, which is hardly much of a distinction. If a guy punches himself in the nose and then insists \"I meant to do that\", I don't think that makes him any less of a dumbass.Human psychology and politics are fraught enough without deliberately obfuscating them. Unfortunately, Wolfe does not have the mastery of psychology to make a realistically complicated text, only a cliched text that is meta-complicated.After finishing the book, I tried to figure out why it had garnered so much praise. I stumbled across a number of articles, including this one by Gaiman and this one by an author who wrote a book of literary analysis about the New Sun series. Both stressed that Wolfe was playing a deliberate meta-fictional game with his readers, creating mysteries and clues in his book for them to follow, so that they must reread the text over and over to try to discern what is actually happening. I won't claim this isn't a technical feat, but I would suggest that if Wolfe wanted us to read his book over and over, he might have written it with verve, style, character, and originality. As the above critic says:\n\"On a first, superficial reading, there is little to distinguish Wolfe\u2019s tetralogy from many other sf and fantasy novels . . . The plot itself is apparently unremarkable.\"\nPerhaps I'm alone in this, but I have no interest in reading your average sword-wielding badass gender-challenged fantasy book over and over in the hopes that it will get better. If Wolfe is capable of writing an original and interesting story, why cover it with a dull and occasionally insulting one?I have enjoyed complex books before, books with hidden messages and allusions, but they were interesting both in their depths and on the surface. I didn't find the New Sun books particularly complex or difficult. His followers have said that he isn't 'concerned with being conspicuously witty', but I'd suggest he's merely incapable of being vibrant or intriguing.There were interesting ideas and moments in the book, and I did appreciate what originality Wolfe did have, but I found it strange that such a different mind would produce such hidebound prose, tired descriptions, convenient plots, and unappealing characters. It has usually been my experience that someone who is capable of thinking remarkable things is capable of writing remarkable things.Sure, there were some interesting Vancian moments, where you realize that some apparently magical effect is actual a piece of sci fi detritus: this character is a robot, that tower is actually a rocket, a painting of a mythical figure clearly depicts an astronaut--but this doesn't actually add anything to the story, they weren't important facts, they were just details thrown in.It didn't matter that any of those things were revealed to be something else than they appeared, because it didn't change anything about the story, or the characters, or the themes or ideas. These weren't vital and strange ideas to be explored, like the mix of sci fi and fantasy in Vance, Le Guin, or Lovecraft, but inconsequential 'easter eggs' for obsessing fans to dig up.As Clarke's Third Law says: any sufficiently advanced technology is indistinguishable from magic. Therefore, switching back and forth between magical explanations and super-technological ones doesn't mean much, on its own. They're indistinguishable. Star Wars may use the trappings of sci fi, but it's just a fantasy story about wizards and knights in space. In order to make the distinction meaningful, you've got to put some kind of spin on it.Overall, I found nothing unique in Wolfe. Perhaps it's because I've read quite a bit of odd fantasy; if all I read was mainstream stuff, then I'd surely find Wolfe unpredictable, since he is a step above them. But compared to Leiber, Howard, Lovecraft, Dunsany, Eddison, Kipling, Haggard, Peake, Mieville, or Moorcock, Wolfe is nothing special.Perhaps I just got my hopes up too high. I imagined something that might evoke Peake or Leiber (at his best), perhaps with a complexity and depth gesturing toward Milton or Ariosto. I could hardly imagine a better book than that, but even a book half that good would be a delight--or a book that was nothing like that, but was unpredictable and seductive in some other way.I kept waiting for something to happen, but it never really did. It all plods along without much rise or fall, just the constant moving action to make us think something interesting is happening. I did find some promise, some moments that I would have loved to see the author explore, particularly those odd moments where Silver Age Sci Fi crept in, but each time he touched upon these, he would return immediately to the smallness of his plot and his annoying prick of a narrator. I never found the book to be difficult or complex, merely tiring. the unusual parts were evasive and vague, and the dull parts constant and repetitive.The whole structure (or lack of it) does leave things up to interpretation, and perhaps that's what some readers find appealing: that they can superimpose their own thoughts and values onto the narrator, and onto the plot itself. But at that point, they don't like the book Wolfe wrote, they like the book they are writing between his lines.I'll lend the book out to some fantasy-loving friends and they'll buy the next one, which I'll then have to borrow from them so I can see if there's ever a real payoff. Then again, if Sevarian's adolescent sexuality is any evidence, the climax will be as underwhelming as the self-assured, fumbling foreplay. If I don't learn to stop giving my heart away, it's just going to get broken again.Ah well, once more unto the breach.My Fantasy Book Suggestions"}, {"userName": "Bess", "userReviewDate": "Apr 17, 2008", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/229445-bess", "userReview": "Update 5/26: finally finished. Man, this is an intense book. I was tempted to give up on it at various points because it's so thoroughly dick lit -- I mean, the hero carries around a sword that he unsheathes, oils, and re-sheaths routinely throughout his travels, and he sleeps with nearly every woman he encounters, but usually in the most patronizing way imaginable (there's actually an extremely painful, cringeworthy attempt at some sort of epiphanic look into the male psyche, wherein it is brought to the reader's attention that men don't only want the hot chicks! They don't discriminate! They want the not-so-hot chicks, too! Preferably simultaneously!) ...all of which would be fine, if the whole thing weren't trying desperately to be something much less transparent than that.

Certainly not less.----- original review -----My first pass through Gene Wolfe's Shadow of the Torturer/Claw of the Conciliator was summed up with a status update I made about two-thirds of the way through:Flashes of brilliance between swaths of tedium.I did not dislike the book, and I expect to re-read it and enjoy it even more some day; but it did not strike me thus. Not on this first reading.Aerin said it well:Reading these books is like trying to watch a foreign movie without subtitles - from two miles away with a crappy set of binoculars, and the audio coming over a fuzzy radio frequency, mixed with three other simultaneous broadcasts. [...] most of the time you're just watching incomprehensible things happening, thinking if you could only see things a little more clearly and understand what the hell people were saying, this might be a really interesting story.And (and Aerin hints at this, as well) -- there is this tendency to wink-and-nudge your way through a book like this. There's some High Vocabulary, and there is an Intricate Plot, and recognizably Epic Characters. And you know for a fact that Gene Wolfe is no dummy; he is a talented storyteller and a gifted author. And who wants to be left behind? Wolfe is gifted and talented and this is a great and convoluted-and-complex-but-epic story and so... it must be brilliant. Who wants to admit that they're left behind? that they didn't get it? that they were frustrated by it, even as they enjoyed it? (Or at least wanted to enjoy it?)And that's where I landed with this one. I wanted to enjoy it, and I believe that there is an enjoyable novel in there--but unless you're going to give it the extra effort on the first pass (or unless you're a preternaturally brilliant ascetic), expect to be a little frustrated on that first pass."}, {"userName": "Jessica \u2741 \u27b3 Silverbow \u27b3 \u2741 Rabid Reads-no-more", "userReviewDate": "Feb 08, 2016", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/10336538-jessica-silverbow-rabid-reads-no-more", "userReview": "MUST read at first available opportunity, b/c Servo is an ode to one of Pierce Brown's favorite characters in literature,  Severian the Torturer ."}, {"userName": "Agnieszka", "userReviewDate": "Dec 21, 2007", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/704067-agnieszka", "userReview": "My three favorite novels in the world are Dune by Frank Herbert, The Name of the Rose by Umberto Eco, and The Book of the New Sun by Gene Wolfe. I bet that many of you have read, and many more have heard of, the first two, but I wonder how many have read the last. The Book of the New Sun is less accessible than The Name of the Rose and weirder than Dune. The mind-bending future world, where the sun is so close to dead that you can see the stars in the daytime, is on par with Dune in its richness and complexity. The (mostly religious) philosophy, which the characters often discuss in casual conversation without it seeming contrived, is on par with The Name of the Rose or better. But the characterization is better than either. Although the main character is male, the female characters are far more real, vivid, and varied than almost anything I've encountered in fiction, and particularly science fiction.The book is full of hints and allusions and puzzles. Despite what some readers may say, all the pieces are there and it's quite possible to put them together, though it might take a second read-through and some thought. I think many readers come away frustrated because they read the first volume alone and find that they have more questions than answers. There's also Gene Wolfe's love of obscure vocabulary--he doesn't make up words, he just resurrects them. I liked learning that an epopt is the opposite of a neophyte and that a carnifex is another word for executioner. You can get by with context, but if you're a word nerd the OED will beckon you. Every now and again the narrative pauses while the characters read a story from a book of tales or have a story-telling contest. The narrator-main character tries to fool you into thinking that it's just an interlude included for his sense of completeness, but like many of things he says, it's just a subtle lie or perhaps self-deception.It's one of those books that I wish fervently my friends would all read, because it's such a pleasure to discuss. I'm not sure I've done a good job of convincing anyone, but if you're a fan of difficult pleasures, this is a book for you."}, {"userName": "Lepton", "userReviewDate": "May 28, 2011", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/3407905-lepton", "userReview": "Gene Wolfe is not a misgynist??!!Before all the sensitive types start in on Gene Wolfe's treatment of women in Shadow and Claw, I thought I would head off such criticisms by exploring women's freedom in Wolfe's Urth.On Urth, women are:1. Permitted to learn to read. There are actually a number of women in the narrative that not only can read but also can read and understand something akin to Latin. But, don't you dare call it Latin, because it's not. Gene Wolfe said so.2. Free to wear clothes or not as they see fit. Much care is taken that women should be offered to wear clothes and even clean clothes when their pathetic nature raises our empathy and pity. Yet, a woman is also apparently free to disrobe and thrown herself naked and pleading to exchange sex for the life of a loved one.3. Free to sell her body for money legally. Money? Good. Sex? Very good. Sex for money? Men have money; a woman, her sex. How can that be wrong?4. Free to be beaten. That a woman should be suffered to live for giving offense to a man is a blessing onto her. She may be beaten and pushed down and she is not hurt much.5. Free to be imprisoned unjustly. In this enlightened age of the far future Urth, women are suffered to live despite they give offense to men and the law of Men. The expense and time to imprison and persecute...err...prosecute a woman in light of her actual value to society is a charity granted to her and her sex.6. Free to be tortured. That the Order of the Seekers for Truth and Penitence should seek to imprison and torture women clearly indicates that women are thought to be capable of speaking truth or even knowing truth. Similarly, this would also suppose that a woman has a soul capable of penitence or that a woman possesses a soul at all.7. Free to be publicly maimed and executed. The branding and public execution of a woman suggests the physical vessel of the woman's body contains a space for moral instruction through ritualized excruciation and killing. A woman is no mere animal that can be killed or beaten without conscience. Her body and her life are valued enough to bring forth a physical and moral revulsion to a public branding and execution that is not only a moment of moral teaching but also Thanatonic catharsis.8. Free to be raped in prison. Make no mistake. In past ages a woman in captivity was the rape toy of every guard and low level official in the prison system. Under the care of the Order, a woman may only be raped as a form of torture by the head inquisitor or his designee. She may be bartered amongst the inquisitor and his inferiors, but she shall not be abused by any other men.These are only some of the many freedoms that women enjoy in the world of Urth so lovingly and intellectually crafted by Gene Wolfe. I for one salute his feminist spirit and his magnanimity to grant women a dignified and full existence in the world of his own creation. And in case my sarcasm isn't clear, F*** you, Gene Wolfe!"}, {"userName": "Lindsay", "userReviewDate": "Mar 26, 2016", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/10326608-lindsay", "userReview": "I stopped after The Shadow of the Torturer.It was ok, and I fully grasp the idea that a reader should be doing a lot of the work when reading a book.

The conceit of the The Book of the New Sun is fairly unique, presenting itself as Gene Wolfe\u2019s translation (also the case with Wolfe\u2019s Latro in the Mist) of a memoir from the far future, forming a sort of bildungsroman of a torturer\u2019s apprentice named Severian (which sounds so much like Severin from Leopold von Sacher-Masoch\u2019s Venus in Furs that I can\u2019t help but wonder if the latter inspired Wolfe\u2019s naming of the former), following his journey from youth to manhood (and beyond) over the course of a single summer. Wolfe\u2019s literary language is sublime, choosing archaisms over neologisms to present a universe that, on the one hand, fits nicely into the \u201cdying earth\u201d subgenre of science fiction pioneered by Jack Vance, yet, on the other, is wholly original (though I did detect a nod to Walter M. Miller, Jr.\u2019s A Canticle for Leibowitz in Severian\u2019s descriptions of the monastic lives lived by those in his Guild of Torturers. Set pieces, including a to-the-death duel with giant (and deadly) flowers, a surprising mystery play performed by primary and secondary characters, and the against-genre-expectations (but character correct) use to which Severian first puts his sword, are satisfying, startling, and occasionally shocking. Great stuff. Come for the banquet, stay for the alzabo\u2026 and dessert."}, {"userName": "Erik", "userReviewDate": "Jan 17, 2015", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/1639329-erik", "userReview": "The book\u2019s cover offers a blurb from Neil Gaiman: \"The best SF novel of the last century.\"Yeah, okay Neil, I thought to myself. I bet you say that to all the pretty books.Then I read the book. And he was right. At least, right if you define \"best\" as \"none better\" rather than \"better than all.\" Book of the New Sun belongs in a class of its own. If there's anything to compare it with, I haven't read it.With this quartet, Gene Wolfe did for speculative literature what Raymond Chandler did to detective fiction back in the 50s: He raised it above its humble genre trappings. Chandler opened my eyes to a new type of writing. Prior to cracking open the pages of The Long Goodbye, I perceived literature as a dichotomy: entertaining genre \u201ctrash\u201d and high-falutin\u2019 Literary tomes. The former focuses on the \u2018what\u2019 while the latter focuses on the \u2018how\u2019 but both possess merit. Chandler's fiction blurs that line. His plots are as entertaining as they come, yet much of a reader's delight arises from the sharp style and tremendous wit with which he wrote.So it is with The Book of the New Sun, though Wolfe\u2019s style could not be more different than Chandler\u2019s. While Chandler\u2019s Marlowe narrates with sharp, forceful prose, Wolfe\u2019s Severian - an apprentice torturer - narrates this old earth science fantasy blend with meandering complexity and guile, unreliable even in his claim that he\u2019s a liar. Does he lie? Yes \u2013 but not in the manner you might think. He lies not by shape, but by weight, giving you the facts plainly enough but hiding their import.Such subversion exists throughout the quartet. It is entirely readable as a straight-forward hero\u2019s journey of the Campbellian variety. It\u2019s an adventure in the same way Chandler\u2019s novels are mysteries. They entertain at the surface level. But they are also so much more than that. In Chandler\u2019s case, his novels are a how-to manual for dealing with a world (that is, our world) so reliant on manipulation that we take for granted the deception we encounter, and might even feel lost without our daily dosage of bullshit advertising, politicking, journalism, and TV drama. In the Book of the New Sun, the adventure masks an allusive labyrinthe, a riddle of time and meaning, that must be traversed by careful reading.Which, if we\u2019re being honest, is problematic these days. Most people are not careful readers and don\u2019t want to be. That is their prerogative, though as a writer myself, I find it frustrating. The defining trait of modern entertainment is its ease of consumption. Book of the New Sun is not easily consumed. With long, tortured sentences, complex diction, discursive asides, and more than a few instances of elision, even a superficial reading requires work. To attain any sort of depth requires even more.But this work does not go unrewarded. The complexity doesn't exist for the sake of complexity, but rather to ambush the reader with a delightfully refreshing subversion and to present a complete picture of a character's mind and life. I even found the book rewarding on a sentence-by-sentence level. It is peppered throughout with insight and interesting prose.In short, Book of the New Sun is very much like a trek through a hilly country. More difficult than taking a car to be sure, but not all that challenging, and I never knew what new beauty I'd find over the next hill.To be shorter still, I loved this book. I absolutely loved it.

I\u2019m not done with the series yet, so I\u2019m not sure how it\u2019s going to end, but so far, I\u2019ve found the story dark and mysterious and enthralling.

Neil Gaiman, Ursula Le Guin, GRRM and goodness knows what other celebs swear by them, not to mention armies of fans among sf readers everywhere. With this kind of adulation writing a review for the books is a risky undertaking. I mean you are fine if you love the books unconditionally and happy to declare yourself a convert, but what if you don't?Fortunately for me I like the book (part 1 & 2) well enough to be able to show some appreciation of its merit, less fortunate is the fact that I don't actually love it.\"Shadow & Claw\" is an omnibus volume comprised of the first two books of the 'The Book of the New Sun': Volume 1: The Shadow of the Torturer and Volume 2: The Claw of the Conciliator. The series is often described as \u201ca novel in four parts\u201d so having read just parts 1 & 2 so far I can not claim to have read the entire book. In fact my attempt to review The Shadow of the Torturer after I finished it was a miserable failure because 25% of a book is too little to write about. Worse still, I first read \u201cThe Shadow of the Torturer\u201d on audiobook and in that format most of it was incomprehensible for me, these books need to be read attentively and I can not do that while jogging. I always find printed books to be more intimate and easier to follow any way. The first thing I noticed about Wolfe\u2019s writing is the prose, it is florid, literate and complex, I often had to read sentences or whole passages twice to decipher their meaning. His writing is also often highly evocative, for example this particular sentence is till rattling around in my head:\n\u201cThe hope in her voice now made me think of a flower growing in shadow.\u201d\nI have never seen a flower growing in shadow but the sentence conjured up a feeling of hopelessness very clearly for me.Many reviews of this book mention that it demands multiple reading for full comprehension. Personally there is at least 15% of the book that I do not quite understand, perhaps after a few days of digesting it more details will fall into place. The author has a habit of suddenly going off on tangents that leave me floundering. There is a whole chapter describing a play put on by the characters that at the time of writing makes no sense to me.The protagonist and narrator of the story Severian is not exactly likable as he seldom shows any emotion, even though his actions are often driven by his feelings. The female characters are all very well developed and I really feel for their plights, including the more villainous ones.OK, that is the best I can do at this point (pathetic, I know), once I finish the remaining volumes I will try to add more substance to this review. This brings me to this passage from the end of the first and second volumes:\n\u201cHere I pause. If you wish to walk no farther with me, reader, I cannot blame you. It is no easy road.\u201d\nDefinitely no easy road, but I\u2019m game!"}, {"userName": "Wanda", "userReviewDate": "Jun 25, 2014", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/9246169-wanda", "userReview": "I started into this series with trepidation\u2014I wasn\u2019t sure exactly how I would feel about a torturer as a main character. But Severian (get it, severe, sever) turns out to be charming in his own way\u2014he is intelligent, empathetic, and friendly. Most of all, torture is just a job. He does it because it is he is a member of the guild, not because he has some psychopathic joy in the process. He does what needs to be done, follows the rules of his guild (except that one time that gets him into trouble), and generally just tries to do a good job. His one characteristic that annoys me is his tendency to \u201clove\u201d which ever woman is closest to him\u2014and they change over fairly regularly and then change back. So far (end of book 2), he hasn\u2019t found a woman that he isn\u2019t interested in nor has he found one who rivets his attention.In some ways he reminds me of the Knight, Sir Percival. There are repeated mentions of his \u201cnoble looks,\u201d suggesting that he may be the illegitimate son of someone of importance. Just as Percival spent his childhood in the forests, \u201cignorant of the ways of men,\u201d so Severian spends his youth confined to a small part of the Citadel, learning his trade as torturer and very little else. Around the age of 15, when Sir Percival had his life-changing encounter with King Arthur\u2019s knights in the forest, Severian has his life-changing evening in the necropolis where he encounters and assists the outlaw Vodalus. Like Percival, his ignorance of the ways of the world outside the Citadel often place him in perilous situations, which he comes through due to his basic honesty and ability to make friends who have the needed skills.Urth is an interesting world too\u2014a very old Earth, apparently formerly space-faring and technological, very much reduced to the rather Medieval state that Severian inhabits. There are occasional bits of technology that still work, continuously reminding the reader that this is in the far future, when the sun has dimmed just as the civilization has.Wolfe\u2019s conceit in these novels is that they are translations from a future language, hence the plethora of words that sound like we ought to know the meanings, but it takes a little bit of thought to figure out exactly where they come from. I\u2019m always interested in linguistics and I like it when an author is too. I\u2019ll definitely be reading the third book in the very near future.Since this volume is actually two books, it counts as 159 & 160 for me from the NPR list of classic science fiction and fantasy."}, {"userName": "Nick T.

Gene Wolfe is an author who has written one of those for me. The Shadow of the Torturer may very well be my favorite fantasy book of all-time if you pinned me down and forced me to give you an answer. I first read it in my early twenties, and recently picked it up again because I wanted to visit the world of Urth again. In many ways, The Shadow of the Torturer has everything that I look for in a great read: awesome world-building, post-apocalyptic setting, mysterious and complicated characters, an engaging and interesting plot, and just a really cool protagonist. The story takes place in what can only be considered a ravaged Earth (called Urth) which is now suffering under a dying sun. The world has been thrown backward into an almost medieval setting and the people both dress and behave in the same manner. However, it is obvious that something is wrong and that underneath everything, the secret to what has occurred will slowly be revealed, whether it be by the end of this book or in subsequent books to follow. This fact alone made me devour the book when I first picked it up all of those years ago. I have always been drawn to a mysterious underlying history in the books that I read. Shadow of the Torturer has that in spades. Severian is a young man who is an apprentice to the Guild of Torturers in a sinister place called the citidel. We get an early impression that Severian does not necessarily relish the opportunity to join the torturers guild, it is just something that he sees as a natural progression of his studies. Severian feels a sense of loyalty to the guild since they raised him after he was left at their doorstep as a child. When a young woman named Thecla is brought to the citidel to be tortured, Severian soon forms a friendship with her. Needless to say, it is frowned upon for any torturer to form any kind of bond with their subjects as their grisly work mandates that no emotion be felt. When it comes time for Thecla to be tortured, Severian commits the ultimate sin of showing mercy to his victim and assists her in committing suicide to end her suffering. At this point, Severian is cast out of the citidel and left to wander the shattered land alone with only his cloak and sword Terminus Est. It is here where the true brilliance of the story takes hold and we get to experience the horrifically beautiful world that Gene Wolfe has created. I will warn most readers that this isn't a light and easy to read fantasy. It requires that you pay attention to every word and every sentence. Things happen that are foreshadows of events that occur later in the book and also the series. But if you feel like reading one of the more impressive monuments of dark fantasy ever imagined, then give Shadow of the Torturer your time. You will not be disappointed. This is an omnibus version which also includes the second Book of the New Sun - Claw of the Conciliator. Claw is also a tremendous continuation of the series. Just pick up all four books, whether they be the single-volume editions or the omnibus versions. You'll see what true fantasy writing can be when in the hands of a master like Gene Wolfe."}, {"userName": "Tadiana \u2729Night Owl\u263d", "userReviewDate": "Jan 30, 2014", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/8734459-tadiana-night-owl", "userReview": "Brilliant but also crazy difficult to unpack, and truly tedious for me for long stretches. *sigh* Maybe I'll give it another shot one of these times, now that I'm (definitely) older and (hopefully) wiser."}, {"userName": "Szplug", "userReviewDate": "Nov 13, 2009", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/1843184-szplug", "userReview": "Gene Wolfe, the poetically accented writer of intricate fantasy/science-fiction hybrids like this exquisite tetralogy, was inspired by that other pen-wielding magician Jack Vance's \nTales of the Dying Earth\n: Wolfe's series also takes place on a radically altered Earth in the far, far future when the Sun's fuel is running dangerously low. Amidst the wreckage of past civilizations lies the sprawling, endless city of Wolfe's protagonist torturer-apprentice Severian. Beginning as a gauzy, haunting bildungsroman, influenced subtly throughout by the Roman Catholic faith of the author and homages to other great works, Severian, cursed and blessed with a flawless memory that may or may not be allergic to the truth, makes a moral choice that leads to his flight from the vast metropolis, a journey requiring literally days of travel. As the story progresses while the fuligin-clad youth ventures forth past the city walls into unknown lands - and companions attach themselves to Severian in pursuit of unknown ends - the itinerant torturer becomes aware of troubles at the court of the Autarch, the all-powerful, myth-shrouded monarch of the torturer's world, who faces scheming rebel courtiers and consults with the enigmatic Hierodules. Severian will also hear rumors of a fierce war with strange-speaking foreigners from the alien culture of the north.Each of the four books that comprise the tetralogy unfold with a subtle shift in tone and tincture. In my opinion, the opening book possesses itself of an atmospheric wonder rarely achieved in the field of fantasy fiction. Whereas Tolkien's The Fellowship of the Ring begins with a localized and bucolic expedition that little hints at the historic importance of the quest vaguely discernible upon the horizon, and Stephen Donaldson's Lord Foul's Bane initiates the reader into the grim, isolated and self-loathing existence of an embittered leper whose first overwhelming experience with The Land inspires him to an act of rape that jars the reader out of the moment, Wolfe's The Shadow of the Torturer is, in many ways, the strongest book in the series. From the opening sentences the reader is immersed in the portentous but ineffable shimmering of a mysterious civilization aged in its incantatory urban flavor like an oaken whiskey; the entirety a smoothly flowing, warming, and immensely enjoyable unfolding as the words daub every action, puzzle, and rumination with the purplish shadows of myth-in-itself. Severian's story is a narrative dream hatched from the timbered depths of moral perturbability and painted in the hues of enigmatic unbinding. The aura of lush decay that permeates the first book provides an ambiance Wolfe can never quite attain to, let alone transcend, in the following three pieces; but the route each of the three provides for the journey towards self-realization for the Torturer Apprentice are, nonetheless, worthy companions to the opening act.This is neither a Tolkien clone nor a genre-checklist fantasy-lite: Wolfe is a gifted writer who excels at painting sombre moods and shifting scenery, at casting mysterious strangers to beset the torturer and scattering hints that Severian's story is not all what it seems; and he expects the reader to make the effort to puzzle through his mysteries and render his veils. A thoroughly enjoyable and sublime series that only gets better with further readings."}, {"userName": "BlackOxford", "userReviewDate": "Jan 06, 2017", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/17744555-blackoxford", "userReview": "Fantastic ConjunctivitisWolfe is most often compared to Tolkien and Lewis. However this is regurgitation of marketing hype. There is little in terms of style or symbology to link Wolfe with either. Aside from the genre of fantasy and a clear talent for creative world-building, Wolfe dwells in a very different universe, a universe not all that dissimilar from Mervyn Peake's Gormenghast trilogy. The physical environment of Wolfe's city of Nessus could easily fit into Peake's Gormenghast Castle and vice-versa: A vast, half-ruined, place, unknown except locally to its inhabitants. A gothic labyrinth that harbours all manner of surprises and threats.Both sets of works play off a background of ancient but incomprehensible tradition that establishes the rigid conditions from which the protagonist must escape. Unlike Severian, Titus knows his forebears, but this difference makes no difference to the comprehensive social discipline and constraint applied to both of them.Both Titus in Peake and Severian in Wolfe are sympathetic characters who struggle against the bonds of convention to capture some sort of independent identity. Both have only a vague notion of what lies outside the boundaries of the city/castle but they yearn toward it with a clearly erotic drive.Many of the other characters also are inter-changeable. The Chief Archivist and his assistant in Wolfe could be copies of Peake's Barquentine and the villainous Steerpike. Bellgrove in Peake could be one of Wolfe's Masters. Peake wrote Gormenghast between 1946 and 1959. It inspired several other works, most notably China Mieville's 2000 steampunk fantasy Perdido Street Station. Wolfe's three (or four) books were written between 1980 and 1983. I have been unable to find any mention of Peake (who died in 1968) by Wolfe or in critical analyses of his work. In a 2014 interview with Wolfe specifically about writers who had influenced him, he makes no mention of Peake (https://www.technologyreview.com/s/52...). So an interesting case of parallel inspiration or a demonstration of the anxiety of influence?

SHADOW AND CLAW is an omnibus consisting of the first half, the volumes THE SHADOW OF THE TORTURER and THE CLAW OF THE CONCILIATOR.The Book of the New Sun is shelved among science-fiction, but it is much more. Wolfe draws on Christianity, the works of J.L. Borges, medieval morality plays, and a thousand elements of \"Spritus Mundi.\" It is essentially a Christian allegory, as \"Sun\" is clearly the homophone of \"Son.\" However, this element doesn't intrude on the unbelieving reader. The BotNS is written with a colourful array of obscure English words, for example: odalisque, fulgurator, carnifex, cenobite, peltast. Nonetheless, Wolfe gives such context that reaching for the Oxford English Dictionary is hardly necessary. A saint's dictionary helps, however, as most characters are named for nearly-forgotten saints.SHADOW AND CLAW introduces us to Severian, an apprentice to a guild of torturers in a far-future Earth, when the sun is dying. As he confesses early on, Severian's narration is essentially the story of how he has \"backed into the throne.\" He begins by telling the reader of his exile for showing a condemned woman mercy and his going forth into a world both alien and wispily recognizable.THE CLAW OF THE CONCILIATOR continues Severian's wanderings, and his unwitting involement in the mysterious politics of his day. Most striking is a play transcribed in the second half. \"Dr. Talos' Play: Eschatology and Genesis\" seems at first a poorly written morality play, but the careful reader will notice myriad hidden references to the book's plot, Greek and middle-eastern myth, and the renewing salvation of Christ as seen by Christianity.Severian is among of one the most complex and believable narrators I've ever read. Wolfe uses Severian to see Urth through his eyes, and much of the information we gather about his world comes from what he doesn't understand. For example, he lives in a world where one no longer distinguishes between ocean and space-going craft, and his confusion gives us important clues about the character Jonas. Furthermore, this book, although only four volumes and a coda, spawns whole years of exegesis, as denizens of the 'net mailing-list \"Urth-l\" can attest. Mystery has always been a continual element in Wolfe's works, but answers do lurk in every paragraph.I admit that the Book of the New Sun is not for everyone; its million allusions and complex language require a fair degree of classical education and may bore many people. Nonetheless, for me it was \"The Book of Gold,\" as I discovered it at an age when it sped me on to the glories of world literature. It shows the way to Borges, Robert Graves, Roman and Greek history and myth, the splendour of exegesis and, for at least me personally, the Church. If this review makes the work sound appealing, I would recommend buying SHADOW AND CLAW and experiencing this wonderful work."}, {"userName": "Adam", "userReviewDate": "Jul 25, 2007", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/214053-adam", "userReview": "If Peake's Titus Alone(after being rewritten by Lovecraft and Borges) was narrated by the crazy guy from Nabokov's Pale Fire it would only hint at the joys of this book..."}, {"userName": "Jonathan Terrington", "userReviewDate": "Jan 04, 2012", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/6313408-jonathan-terrington", "userReview": "I've been reading bits and pieces of this book for month and it was only in the last couple of days that I gathered the energy to finish it all. Let me state the positives of this book succinctly: it starts off excellently, the language is just hard enough but not too hard and the worldbuilding is fascinating. However, considering this is rated just below The Lord of the Rings and The Hobbit as one of the greatest fantasy-sci/fi works of all, I cannot quite see why. I believe that, perhaps, the language is more deceptive than it may appear - because precious little actually takes place within the work in terms of plot narrative. When the narrative can be summed down to: assassin is kicked out of guild and sets off to explore the earth, then you have a narrative which isn't overly complex. Sure, things happen to our torturer, Severian, but at the same time very little also happens to him. Everything becomes a cycle of: kill new people, find new wonders of the world, sleep with a new girlfriend, rinse, lather, repeat. It's inane in its repetition and the repetition almost made me give this three stars.But that said, the language is beautifully deceptive, and it was for this reason that I kept that extra star. The language is beautiful enough to distract from the fact that very little actually happens within the novel - very little of any kind of moral or significant depth, that is. Also, the worldbuilding was magnificently set in an Earth that was now Urth - a million odd years into the future, where technology and magic have become almost one and the same. I appreciated that aspect of creating another world setting for the book.Yet, my overall summary is: only read this if you have a desire to complete a list of must-read fantasy books. The language can prove to be a stumbling block to some and aside from the language I could not find any real thematic or moral lessons within the book, which make it a shallow read and not so much of a deep philosophical read for once. But then again, as I said recently, not being able to find such things could also mean that I am not reading the book deeply. Or else, that I felt it was a novel in which I did not need to look overly deeply - being distracted by the language and world as I was."}, {"userName": "John Wiswell", "userReviewDate": "Jun 25, 2007", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/147818-john-wiswell", "userReview": "This is a handy volume, with the first two books of the series together. That's especially useful to someone new to Gene Wolfe since the first book (Shadow of the Torturer) does very little to establish a plotline and ends extremely abruptly. Your curiousity for what happened after the end is sated by flipping over to the second book (Claw of the Conciliator), which does more with plotlines, though it is still a wildly tangential book. This is not a plot-hound's series. It's not even a particularly good character-hound's series, at least in the first two books. It's studded with interesting characters, but they scarcely develop and are mostly interesting for what they are in a moment. But if you can get over your obsession with plotlines and simply follow the characters as they go out and do things (and more often, have things befall them), this is an interesting series. It's thick with religious symbolism, and its first person narrator is preachy as all get-out; worse, as the first person narrator is also the main character, his reflections leave little emotional feeling for how he develops on his journey, and where he does develop it's so blatantly exposed as to have little emotional impact. Mind you, his situation changes (drastically, though not nearly as dangerously as we'd imagine for someone who has to carry a sword for the majority of two books). His world is very interesting, one of the best post-apocalyptic worlds you'll find, particularly as it's not merely a few days \"after,\" but a few billion years \"after.\" The first book is almost all about setup and introduction (and some extremely convenient happenings, which would have been more forgivable if we'd seen more payoff to those setups in either of these two books); the second starts poking the dominos, yet despite the allusions to grand designs behind the Claw and certain characters, we don't see many of the dominos fall either. Instead, what awaits you at the end of the second book is another abrupt ending, which is particularly disappointing since it happens in the middle of the most interesting scene in the series up until that point."}, {"userName": "Tt", "userReviewDate": "Feb 11, 2008", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/895675-tt", "userReview": "This is the book that I saved the five stars for.

At the same time, its baroque language, ambiguous plot, unreliable narrator, and depth of symbolism are likely to discourage most casual readers. Therefore, new readers need to dedicate themselves to unraveling the many layers of plot, religious symbolism, literary references, and narrative sleight-of-hand. They also need to understand that it is essentially a single integrated work, so reading individual volumes is not enough to render judgement. You need to read all four volumes to appreciate what Gene Wolfe has painstakingly crafted. If you do so, you will be rewarded richly indeed.I\u2019ve actually read the entire series twice in the past two decades, and decided that I would listen to the audiobook editions narrated by the excellent Jonathan Davis to give me a new perspective on the whole creation. He is the ideal narrator for a work this ambitious, as he tackles the baroque story with gravitas, confidence, and enthusiasm. I can\u2019t imagine a narrator better suited to the task.THE BOOK OF THE NEW SUN is that type of work, one that rewards multiple readings and reflection and still retains many of its mysteries tantalizingly out of reach. If you are someone comfortable with complexity, mysteries, and a lack of explanations, you should be able to enjoy Wolfe\u2019s elusive style.This time I also prepared myself by reading Marc Aramini\u2019s Between Light and Shadow: An Exploration of the Fiction of Gene Wolfe, 1951 to 1986, an 826-page analysis covering Wolfe\u2019s output through 1986, including all of his short stories and his novels The Fifth Head of Cerberus, Peace, Free Live Free, and THE BOOK OF THE NEW SUN. Aramini\u2019s analysis sheds much light on the key underlying themes of the story, namely the death and resurrection of the Urth via the coming of the New Sun, the ambiguous messianic nature of the protagonist Severian, the healing power of the Claw of the Conciliator, and Severian\u2019s duty to undergo testing by alien powers to determine if humanity is indeed worthy of this rebirth.There are so many themes and ideas in Wolfe\u2019s epic that it has spawned an informal school of analysis, including books such as Michael Andre-Druissi\u2019s Lexicon Urthus, Robert Borki\u2019s Solar Labyrinth: Exploring Gene Wolfe\u2019s \u201cBook of the New Sun\u201d and Peter Wright\u2019s Attending Daedalus: Gene Wolfe, Artifice and the Reader. Therefore, it would be presumptuous of me to try to analyze his magnum opus in a brief review such as this. Rather, I will just touch on the most important themes of the book and dispense with a discussion of plot details, which you can discover on your own.To drastically simplify things, THE BOOK OF THE NEW SUN is the story of the young apprentice Severian raised in the guild of torturers called the Seekers for Truth and Penitence. He recalls to the reader his complex path from lowly apprentice to the Autarch of the Commonwealth, the most powerful ruler on far-future Urth. This world lies millions of years in the future, to the point that our own world is no longer even a memory. It is a baroque fantasy world filled with mysterious terms such as archon, carnifex, cataphract, chalcedony, fuligin, hipparch, lazaret, monomachy, optimate, pelerine, psychopomp, quaesitor, thaumaturge, and uhlan. None of these terms are coined by Wolfe, but rather reflect his erudite love of obscure and archaic terms. They lend an air of incredible antiquity to the world of Urth, and the story takes direct inspiration from Jack Vance's THE DYING EARTH.Severian encounters all manner of friends & foes, allies and enemies, lovers, thieves, soldiers, actors, priests, witches, commoners, malevolent creatures, inscrutable aliens, and other powerful beings whose intentions are unclear. What they all share is an interest in the fate of Severian, for though he does understand this himself for much of his journey, he is destined to not only become Autarch but to serve as the representative to the stars to determine if the dying red sun of Urth is worthy of being renewed in both a symbolic and literal sense, ushering in a New Sun and renewed era of humanity. It is an outcome that is constantly alluded to but never fully explained, though Wolfe later explored this is more detail (while still retaining much mystery) in a companion coda called The Urth of the New Sun (1987).The religious symbolism of the story is both explicit and complicated. Severian is positioned as the obvious messiah, the living embodiment of the New Sun, and as he wields the cross-shaped executioners\u2019 sword Terminus Est, the Christ-like imagery is plain for any reader to see. And yet throughout the story, Severian himself is a naive and conflicted character, one who struggles first to set aside his training as a torturer and executioner, and later as a man fighting to understand his role as a possible bringer of redemption and resurrection to a corrupt and dying world. This goes far beyond a Christian allegory such as C.S. Lewis\u2019 CHRONICLES OF NARNIA, for instance. Of equal importance is the religious talisman that comes into Severian\u2019s hands by accent, the Claw of the Conciliator. This object seems capable of bringing the dead back to life and healing fatal wounds when Severian wields it, and is associated with the Conciliator, a figure of the ancient past who is both Christ-like and may also have extra-terrestrial origins.THE BOOK OF THE NEW SUN also incorporates a number of stories-within-stories, told by various characters and also in the form of stage plays performed by the characters (echoing the story itself from the author\u2019s perspective) during key moments in the narrative. One could write a dissertation on interpreting the meanings of these stories as they relate to the overall themes of the book, and this effort is far beyond me, but Marc Aramini does discuss the implications of a number these stories in his book Marc Aramini\u2019s Between Light and Shadow: An Exploration of the Fiction of Gene Wolfe, 1951 to 1986, including Dr. Talos\u2019 play \u201cEschatology and Genesis\u201d, \u201cThe Tale of the Student and His Son\u201d, \u201cThe Tale of the Boy Called Frog\u201d, \u201cThe Cock, the Angel, and the Eagle\u201d, \u201cThe Armiger\u2019s Daughter\u201d, as well as some extremely vivid dreams of Severian. This literary device is equally vital to understanding the layers of meaning in his book Peace.The story is further complicated by the roles of Abaia, Erebus, and their servants the undines, underwater beings of great power that seem intent on conquering humanity, but at the same time provide aid to Severian at times and may even benefit from the inundation of Urth if Severian is to succeed in bringing the New Sun. They are constantly observing Severians\u2019 progress, but it is unclear whether they seek to aid or prevent his quest.We also have the even more inscrutable role of the Hierodules, alien beings from other worlds that reside on Urth and also take a keen interest in Severian and his path to becoming the Autarch. Despite their implied powers, they sometimes seem to indicate that they serve him, but this in never made entirely clear. They appear to have a connection with the current Autarch, but it is not apparent whether they favor Severian over his rule.Finally, there is the ambiguous role of the reigning Autarch himself, and his mysterious advisor Father Inire. They obviously wield great power, and if they were to decide Severian were a threat to them they could easily have him killed. Yet they instead appear in various guises in his adventures, never clearly his ally or enemy, always with opaque intentions and tantalizing comments. Father Inire in particular seems to control the power to travel between the stars via the sinister power of mirrors and labyrinths (an obvious nod to Jorge Luis Borges), but does not demonstrate to what end he might use them.In the end, THE BOOK OF THE NEW SUN does not easily yield up its secrets to interpretation or analysis, but this is most certainly the source of its lasting appeal to discerning literary SFF readers over the last 35 years. There are layers of meaning that remain obscure even after multiple readings, but it is clear that Wolfe has crafted a masterpiece that is worth the attempts to conquer it, a literary Mt. Everest that every serious reader in the genre will be drawn to again and again, and there is much to be gained in each attempt, whether the peak is attained or not."}, {"userName": "Patrick", "userReviewDate": "Feb 26, 2018", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/44737540-patrick", "userReview": "If you like the Wizard of Earthsea books you might like these. I enjoyed both novels (The Book of the New Sun #1-2) for what they are but I didn't love them. I felt they lacked adventure because the pace was slow and monotonous. I don't mean to say \"if you love boring stuff--this is for you!\" Personally, I just need some action. The \"let's develop a philosophical psyche monologue of a torturer's life and then learn from it internally while walking\" isn't my cup of soda. Don't get me wrong, I love to see character growth, but growth with some action, please! Maybe a part of me has been ruined by society's fast paced--dramas/adventures.As a character I thought Severian was interesting. He is trained to be a torturer but eventually commits the heinous act of mercy. God forbid the boy has a heart! He has no choice but to leave his \"home\". There were some parts I enjoyed but overall I had to free space on my book shelf by trading it in for something better."}, {"userName": "Bryan", "userReviewDate": "Nov 03, 2013", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/16468510-bryan", "userReview": "It has been suggested that The Book Of The New Sun series is too complex a work to evaluate on one reading. First of all, I don't necessarily believe that and secondly, I have a two kids, a full-time job and a band, and I'm also not the quickest reader. As it seems that I'll probably never get to read all the books I'd like to in my lifetime, one read-through is going to have to suffice, at least for now. I'd love to re-read it someday, though, and if any series deserves a re-read, it's this one.For the sake of clarity (if such a thing is truly achievable with a work like this one) I'm going to separate my review of this book into its two component novels.The Shadow Of The Torturer: Having read an article written by Neil Gaiman about Gene Wolfe, I went into this book knowing that Wolfe often employs unreliable narrators in his fiction and that readers must be wary in order to more fully catch Wolfe's gist, and yet I was still caught off-guard. The main character in this series is Severian, an apprentice torturer who becomes a disgraced journeyman early on in this first part of the series, and who is blessed/cursed with an eidetic (photographic) memory. It is his eidetic memory which serves to alert the reader to the first layer of unreliability in Severian, as a moderately attentive reader can catch Severian lying. Once/if the reader allows themselves to read this story more cautiously and critically, the reader begins to question whether anything Severian says can truly be trusted, and this, I believe, is what Wolfe was truly aiming for. Although it does make reading the story a more exhausting experience than that of reading other more conventional novels, I personally found this quality in particular to be one which gave me a high degree of satisfaction and which also increased my interest in and enjoyment of The Book. Anyway, in Shadow there really isn't a lot of plot (if you were to ignore the interpretive aspects of the story). Severian, a Christ-figure, gets sent out on the road by his guild and by the end of Shadow, is only just making it to the outskirts of the city Nessus. However, he has by this time already met most of the key players in what will be his epic adventure, as well as found the legendary Claw Of The Conciliator, an artifact with reputedly magical properties (whether it actually has said properties is an entirely other matter).The Claw Of The Conciliator: Inexplicably glossing over events which were about to occur at the end of Shadow, Severian picks up the story in a town outside of the city of Nessus. Claw is a lot more eventful than Shadow, in my opinion, and also gives the reader many more puzzles to speculate upon, such as the identity and true nature of the green man, the powers (or lack thereof) of the titular Claw, the presence of cyborgs/androids and aliens on Urth, the metafictional aspects of Dr. Talos' play, the true motives of the Autarch, and so on, and so on. Wolfe also really steps up his use of archaisms, which I, as a word-nerd, love (one of my favourites from this book is apotropaic). Severian, in this book, also moves beyond being a typical testosterone-laden young lad (although he still retains that trait as a part of his dominant Severian-self) with his absorbtion of Thecla's personality and memories. This, while on the surface giving Severian more insight into certain aspects of his world, in actuality further calls into question not only Severian's reliability as a source of factual information but also objectivity itself (namely, whether such a thing is even possible).In closing, I thought this book was fantastic and challenging, although I would most certainly not recommend it to most people. Sadly, the majority of people I know would have absolutely no interest in tackling such a tricksy and multifaceted piece of fiction as this one, or if they did would most likely not be willing to engage it on the level that it requires and truly deserves."}, {"userName": "Brittany", "userReviewDate": "Jun 17, 2010", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/92397-brittany", "userReview": "I can understand why people rave about this book, and I can see why people hate it, too. I thoroughly enjoyed most of it, though there were a few factors that churned my stomach a bit.First the positive: This was a dense, intense, vividly written and imagined universe. It's Earth, a long time in the future, as we're approaching the death of the sun. A mythology has grown up around the dying sun, in fact, complete with prophecies of a New Sun that will herald the dawn of a newer and brighter era, hence the name of the tetrology. The world is rich and well-rendered. Wolfe has managed to capture the atmosphere just right, using lovely archaic words and hinting at aspects he never fully fleshes out. However, the reader is able to glean (from geography, some of the legends, and a glorious glimpse of a maned wolf (Chrysocyon brachyurus, the first I've ever encountered in a novel) that the story takes place (or at least begins) somewhere in South America, near the Amazon River. The story follows an apprentice torturer, Severian, as he makes a series of decisions that drastically change his life. In the process, he has a series of remarkable adventures, but he's certainly no assistant pig keeper. This book is much darker than your average hero quest. Of course, given Severian's vocation, this isn't a surprise. All the sex and the blatant sexism was a bit of a surprise (though it's hardly the first overtly sexist SF classic). Here is a list of all the females, above the age of puberty, that Severian met on his travels and did not immediately fall in love with/lust after: . There you go. That says a lot. All the women are beautiful, though of course in different ways, and Severian spends a lot of time ruminating over how their beauty differs and what different feelings each woman engenders in him. I get the feeling these are meant to be deep, insightful inner monologues, but they're shockingly sexist, shallow, and they really alienated me from Severian, who I otherwise pretty much liked. He has sex (sometimes quite upsetting, only questionably-consensual sex) with as many women as possible, as quickly after meeting them as plausible. All this coupling got in the way of the otherwise engaging story and plot.People have complained about the vocabulary and, while I understand their complaint, I don't agree with it. I loved all the old words, looking them up was fun, and they went along way to creating the haunting, alien, dissonant atmosphere that made the book so intense. Occasionally, the plot would take an inexplicable turn that seemed to make sense to Severian, but never really did to me. However, I'm fine being a little lost at points in a book. I rather enjoy it. Someone said this wasn't a good beach book; I completely disagree. The perfect beach book is one that is dense, absorbing, intense, and fully transports you to a completely alien world where you have to puzzle out everything that's going on around you. I will certainly read the next two books, though I hope Severian maybe begins to interact with women as if they are actual human beings at some point."}, {"userName": "Simon", "userReviewDate": "Jun 04, 2009", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/1071724-simon", "userReview": "This is a difficult book to review, partly due to the fact that the story is far from concluded at the end of this volume, but mainly because this is one of the most unusual fantasy books I have ever read.This volume contains the first two parts of a quartet. At the end of each part, the author pauses, reminding the reader that they may wish to stop reading on at this point and that it is no easy road. Wolfe is right, it is no easy road but somehow I feel it is worth reading on.The prose is poetic with a dream like quality. The story unwinds in a most unpredictable fashion, seeming to digress in often confusing and seemingly senseless ways that appear to have no relevence to the story but under the surface allude to an undercurrent of themes that the reader only barely glimses. As such, I imagine that this book would benefit from one or more re-reads in order to absorb and understand the story a little better. In time, I might well increase my rating.It can get quite confusing and disorienting but never too much or for too long before the author reigns it in again and stops the reader from getting disenfranchised with the story. As I said, it is no easy road but it seems a road worth treading and I look forward to the last two parts of this story."}, {"userName": "Carl", "userReviewDate": "Sep 30, 2007", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/49620-carl", "userReview": "Have now finished this first volume (two novels) in the New Sun series of Wolfe's-- great stuff! Well, you have to be someone who doesn't need to be catered to. I notice that with a lot of Wolfes' books those who don't like them complain about them being hard to get into, dragging, not going anywhere, that sort of thing-- but I think we can attribute this to different kinds of reading, the sort of which CS Lewis talks about in his Experiment in Criticism, if I remember correctly-- I believe it comes down to reading for a basic sort of escape, for a more passive experience in which you are given want you want and expect and don't have to work for it (ie, don't have to work to keep your eyes on it), versus reading to be transformed, reading in a way which admits that the book is worthwhile in its own right and has a right to be engaged with, rather than you having the right to be engaged by it. I think this is one reason the classics stay classics (other than the power canon gives to the upper/middle classes or others who master it and so mark themselves as the cultural elite)-- if we engage with them at all, we do so because they have rights over us and so we grant them those rights and are able to experience them in a \"literary\" way, rather than what I'm for the moment calling \"escapist\". This isn't to say that the way we perceive the work is all there is to it-- things can be written to facilitate escapism, and to facilitate transformation (another term I'm using loosely, sorry!), and the latter are signaled in their own ways, for example, by other respected authors calling Gene W. \"dangerous\", etc, or by the very obviously overwrought riddle of a fiction that the Fifth Head of Cerberus is. It also isn't to say that \"literary\" books need to be anti-narrative, or unenjoyable apart from intellectual candy-- in fact, I think the more vulgar branch of escapist literature, which tells us that the only strength in story-telling is keeping the action rolling, is what makes it difficult to appreciate the fuller aesthetic (not purely intellectual) beauties of \"literary\" narrative-- the muscles responsible for processing narrative atrophy, or never get built up (I'm more inclined to say they atrophy). Take Tolkien, who in many ways is accurately called an escapist author and who may be perceived as more popular-- some would defend the \"escapist\" stuff I've been talking about by mentioning him as both escapist and literary, but I would point out that nearly every one I know has parts of Tolkien they get hung up on, whether the descriptions, the long start, or Tom Bombadil, things which cater to the needs of the \"work\" rather than the desire of the reader for a smooth ride. Also, despite being criticized for a naive portrayal of evil, it is now more accepted that Tolkien was one of the \"war\" authors, traumatized by one of the world wars and writing a much more nuanced view of heroism, evil, violence, etc, than one would expect in \"escapist fantasy\"-- Tolkien may still be called \"escapist\", but escapist in a productive way (what that is would be another essay, though you can read his take on it in \"On Fairy Stories\"). OK, I'm going on a bit long, but my point being that \"naive\", or vulgarly \"escapist\" reception of Tolkien which is only concerned with whether or not he is entertaining you is less likely to contribute to your ability to navigate the real world, morally/ethically/intellectually, whatever, whereas engaging with the work on its own terms, finding sympathy for Tom Bombadil, for scenes which may not immediately seem connected to the action, etc,-- well, I think healthy engagement like that is good for us in the same way that talking with someone in a way which allows you to sympathize with them, understand them better, see through their eyes, etc, is good for us, and similarly is always healthier for us than talking/listening to someone just to get through the conversation or get some special bit of information from them or get compliments, etc. Yes, I admit, I think there it is possible to differentiate between good and bad reading ethically speaking... but I do have to admit that Lewis also said that both kinds of reading are acceptable, and I certainly read to escape to, so I think my condemnation of the one is motivated more by all the poor reviews I see of the sort of book that demands the other sort of reading. And I should probably admit that the \"ways of reading\" take on literature also has the potential to be as elitist as the enforcement of a canon, but \"escapist\" lit. is itself a mind-numbing tool of the state, or at least potentially so-- so nothing is inherently innocent! But good writing/reading is a healthy antidote to that, I think.All that to say-- loved this book, but it is demanding! Also, as I start through the next book, there are plenty of anti-hero elements to the main character, but I think learning to sympathize with a character's faults while not necessarily endorsing them is in itself a good exercise. Original Review:I've read the first half of this volume now, which is the first book of the four in the series. Got hung up for a while, unfortunately after a friend complained about it-- I didn't think my enthusiasm could be dampened so easily-- but I've really enjoyed it. Wolfe's work has such an interesting, surreal quality to it, at the same time that things still cohere, and you trust that even when they don't, they must actually work together. And his prose is so beautiful-- a bit \"off\" in a way, but he does a good job of making language and story beautiful by making it strange enough that it is called to our attention (what was the term for that again? Coined by the Russian formalists, I think). I think I'll need to reread the series several times to \"get\" it, but that seems to be the way it is with all of Wolfe's work, and it doesn't stop me from enjoying it. Creative and insightful. And in one of the last chapters I read there was a reference to the moons Verthandi which circle a dead star-- Verthandi being the present participle of the verb \"to become, to happen\" and one of the names of the three norns in Norse Mythology who are apparently adaptations of the Greek fates adapted to the Norse belief in Norns who accompany childbirth, set a child's fate, etc-- the one named \"Verthandi\" is interpreted as representing the present. Wolfe borrows from other bits of our past to translate the past of the far future (as he mentions in a dry little appendix on the problems of translating an as-yet unwritten document from the far future), which makes me wonder how many connections I'm missing. That Wolfe is a fan of Norse lit is not a surprise to me, after reading his Wizard-Knight duology, but I hadn't realized that he referenced \"my\" mythology as far back as this series. I suppose it could also be a random mistake, but considering that the three Norns are likely covered even in basic introductions to Norse myth, it seems reasonable enough that a well-read man like Wolfe would have come across this tidbit."}], "description": "The Book of the New Sun is unanimously acclaimed as Gene Wolfe's most remarkable work, hailed as \"a masterpiece of science fantasy comparable in importance to the major works of Tolkien and Lewis\" by Publishers Weekly, and \"one of the most ambitious works of speculative fiction in the twentieth century\" by The Magazine of Fantasy and Science Fiction.
