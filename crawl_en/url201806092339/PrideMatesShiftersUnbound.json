Pride Mates is a strange concoction of 3 parts instaloving alpha male, 2 parts nonsensical female MC and half a part of shaky world-building. Put them all together and they just kind of distill into a boring muckwater that you neither want to drink - or pour out into the sink in the fear that it leech into the wild and cause untold destruction.It's not like Jennifer Ashley can't write, because I'm rather fond of her Stormwalker UF series by her other nom de plume, Allyson James. However, I'm also infinitely suspicious of writers with multiple names in pretty much the same genres. After all, the only real difference between PNR and UF is the ratio of sex to world building/storyline. Why all the pseudonyms then, huh?! It's not like people are going to be like, \"Ewwwww, she writes books of the exact same caliber but containing marginally more sex! I HAVE NO INTEREST IN THAT AND AS AN ASIDE, WHAT IS THE COLOUR BLUE AND WHAT DOES IT MEAN TO YOU!?!?!?!?!\"But I'm off-track. Liam is hot and Irish, because to be otherwise would violate the laws of the romance industry.Ladies, the line forms to the left!Kim is a lawyer trying to prove a Shifter, in a segregated and speciest version of today's society, didn't kill his girlfriend. The Shifters aren't being helpful, and within 24 hours Kim is \"mated\" to Liam who has fallen desperately in love with her.Blah, blah, blah. Look, I don't necessarily dislike the over-protective alpha male stuff - but, for me, it has to be balanced by the female protagonist. That's why Mac and Barrons is so awesome, or Kate and Currans. Because the dude does his over protective spiel and the female MC goes, \"That's a nice little mantanty you had there, but I think I'll do what I like, thanks!\"And it's not like Kim didn't put up a fight every now and again - but it's that she is supposed to be a kickass lawyer and there was really no indication of that in the novel. \"Oh, you're kidnapping me and holding me hostage? Look, I'll make out with you on the bed, stay the night then insist on being released in the morning, okay?\" YOU'RE A LAWYER, WOMAN! The segregation aspects, at first, proved to be the most interesting aspect of the novel. But, well, that didn't stick. You're not really dealing with inequality and themes of a segregationist society if the people being oppressed don't really give a shit, are you?So my eternal search for good PNR smut continues. Alas, I shall have to leave this series on the wayside.

The introduction into the Shiftertown world and hierarchy was interesting and never boring, which is no small feat for the first book in a series. The way the characters were developed and introduced into the story made me feel like I was meeting new friends, and not reading a who\u2019s who of the Shifter world. I loved Liam! I loved him so much that I want an I LOVE LIAM bumper sticker. He was such an awesome alpha, but also a wonderful man. Dylan, Sean and Connor will be excellent heroes in upcoming books, there\u2019s no doubt about it.My biggest problem with this book is that, as I said, it\u2019s the first book in the series, and the only book of the series currently published.

I still thoroughly enjoyed Jennifer Ashley's shifters, especially their all consuming love they develop for their mates! This seems to be the biggest factor I am missing in the current reads today...You know...that love that is possessive, and forever?? I love that in my romance books, and the way the hero will love his heroine through everything. Some may say this isn't realistic; but the fact is that I read to get away from realism most of the time! I enjoy reading about the couple being together, and having hot and wild sex!!! LOL So, I am sticking to this series for now, and seeing what else comes up from it. The second book will be another re-read for me, and then I will be refreshed so that I can start book three! This has been fun to go back and see why I fell in love with Romance in the first place!I am a firm believer that you can never go wrong with a book written by Jennifer Ashley...She is the best of the best in my opinion!!"}, {"userName": "Elizabeth", "userReviewDate": "Jun 06, 2015", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/27276528-elizabeth", "userReview": "3.5 Lovin' Liam Stars\"A girl walks into a bar...No. A human girl walks into a Shifter bar.\"Pride Mates is my first read by Jennifer Ashley. I strive to read a variety of genres and authors. Although my preference seems to be a modern romance (with a hint of dark), I occasionally dabble in the paranormal sector of the book world. Pride Mates was quite an intriguing read.Jennifer Ashley has created a world where Shifters (animals that can shift into humans and visa versa) are forced to wear a collar in order to curb their urges to live like animals. The Shifters are organized into prides and clans where they live separate from the humans. Shifters are not allowed to eat in the same places as humans. Shifters are not allowed to fly in planes. This element paired with the fact that this book happens to be set in non other then one of my favorite cities- Austin Texas. The irony is Austin is known for it's weirdness!Liam is a powerful shifter. He and his family are from Ireland. Kim is a lawyer who has been hired to defend a shifter named Brian. Brian has been accused of killing his human girlfriend. Due to the requirements of her case, Kim ventures to Liam's Shiftertown in order to interview family and friends of her client. \u201cHe looked like a man who'd invite you to rest your head on his shoulder while he made everything bad go away.\u201dWhen Liam meets Kim, there is an immediate attraction between the two. The Shifters are very physical with each other. The feeling of touch is critical for them to comfort one another. As Liam and Kim travel through Shiftertown, they form a friendship that is sure to bloom into more.\u201cYou all sound like you don\u2019t take this seriously, like you don\u2019t want me to get Brian free. Brian\u2019s mother is barely holding it together. You and Sean had to do the comforting sandwich with her, remember?\u201dJust like every great story with a hero there must be a dark nemesis. in Pride Mates there is an evil shifter named Fergus. He wants Kim to stay silent. In order to protect her, Liam claims Kim as his mate. What works really well in this book is the family connections. I was completely enamored with Liam, his father, his brother, and his nephew. These men care so deeply for each other. Additionally, the passion between Liam and Kim was off the charts hot. I recognize that this was a definite love/lust at first sight and yet, the paranormal element allowed me to dismiss any qualms about these two connecting so fast. Therefore, Ms. Ashley was quite successful with this aspect of the plot. I wanted to join the fun with these characters. They were so likable and driven to protect each other. Additionally, Ms. Ashley does an excellent job of bringing forth a truly relevant issue through this PRN story. Because the Shifters are discriminated against so violently, it reminds us of the importance of accepting and loving one another. The only problematic element in this read was Kim's inability to clearly identify her relationship with Liam. At first, she wants him and then she seems confused by what the mating process means. Finally, she decides she wants to be with him and then HE turns her away. I am all for a little cat and mouse play (what we call in the theatre world advance/retreat) action. However, this part of the story was a bit jarring for me and definitely distracted me from the core of the story.Overall, I recommend Pride Mates to anyone who enjoys a good PRN romance. The plot was well developed and as I stated earlier I absolutely adored the characters. The action was intense and well distributed throughout the read. It is because of my love for these Irish Shifters that I have already started reading the next book in the series."}, {"userName": "Shannon", "userReviewDate": "Jan 08, 2010", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/2016128-shannon", "userReview": "Before you get discouraged by my two star rating I just want to say that I will be reading the next installment when it comes out. There were just enough unique ideas that the author came up with that I want to continue reading. This series has a good premise but it's literally oozing with the cheesy trappings of the paranormal romance genre.District Attorney Kim Fraser has a Shifter murder case dumped in her lap. The Shifter had a human girlfriend who got killed and he's blamed for it even though the evidence against him is lacking. Kim thinks he's innocent so she tries everything she can to try to insert herself into the Shifter community to learn its secrets. She meets up with tall, dark, sexy AND Irish, Liam Morrissey to get information that will help Brian go free. Needless to say, Kim and Liam get along quickly and become entangled in each other's lives. Liam is a Fae cat, an amalgamation of all the best traits of all the big cats. Having met Curran in Magic Bites I have to say that Liam just isn't as menacing as he could have been. These shifters just don't come to life as they could, especially if you've read Patricia Briggs' Mercy Thompson series; she has the best werewolves out there that I've ever read about. It might be unfair to compare this light and fluffy paranormal romance with the grittier story-driven urban fantasies I mentioned above, but it's hard not to wish for something more engaging and real.One thing I did like was the way the author approached the idea of shifters in this world. The shifters are controlled with collars, thin necklaces fused into their skin that were forged by the Fae to keep the shifters from harming anyone. If they show any aggression their body is wracked with pain and they become basically immobile. So really, it's a fancy shock collar. The shifters are discriminated against and segregated from the general population, and they're not allowed to have new technology or attend universities. I appreciate that she's trying something different and not just writing another cookie cutter shifter romance. There was also touches of humor here and there that I wish she would have inserted more often. I especially liked how Liam was going around Kim's office saying \"Top 'o the mornin' to you,\" because he says that's what Americans expect him to sound like. It was funny but I just wish she had inserted similar moments like this, it really could have made the book better and less cliched. Here's some other problems I had with this book. First, there's little to no sexual tension. The characters hook up within the first 24 hours that they know each other. Ok, so he has his whole animal instinct going for him and he is gorgeous so they can sort of be forgiven. One night stands do happen after all. But then, within the next 72 hours they're bound together as mates (this is on the back of the book and also part of the title, so don't worry, no spoiler here.) Liam falls head over heals for Kim in less than half a week and wants to have babies and grow old together. Strange for real life but unfortunately common in paranormal romances. Another problem I had was all the emotions running rampant with, surprisingly, the men. I understand that shifters crave the touch of others* and are normally considered more affectionate, than say, vampires or zombies. But come on, do we have to hug it out every time someone argues, or after any sort of mis-communication, or before, during, and after any kind of celebration? And then cry as well? Honestly with all the mood swings and misty eyes you'd think it was the men's time of the month - and not even in a moon-called sort of way.So I think if you can't stomach the caveman mentality of \"mate, protect, procreate\" then you should probably pick up a different book. Every now and then I don't mind reading something like this because it's normally got a hot man and even hotter sex and it's mindless fun. With a few changes this book could have easily been better, but it unfortunately fell short. I will read the next book though to see where she takes things. The first book I read by her, Mortal Temptations, was ok but not the greatest. She had some good ideas though so I picked up the sequel, Mortal Seductions, and I'm glad I did because I liked it a lot more. I'm hoping the same thing will happen with the sequel to Pride Mates and I do look forward to checking it out.*in reference to Anita Blake's \"puppy piles\""}, {"userName": "Catherine", "userReviewDate": "Dec 07, 2010", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/3282244-catherine", "userReview": "*Originally Read 12/5/10*After accidentally leaving a book I was reading at work I was restlessly prowling my shelves when I came upon this. I'd heard some pretty good things about the book and I enjoyed some of this author's other books, so I figured I'd finally give it a go. I enjoyed it for the most part, but it unfortunately didn't thrill me as much as it did some of my friends.The premise of the book was one of the most interesting parts for me. I really liked the society the author described and how she didn't skim over the unattractive prejudicial parts of it. It was nice to read a book where that issue isn't neatly brushed aside in order for the hero and heroine to have a happily ever after. Sacrifices had to be made on Kim's part if she really wanted to be together. Liam also had to sacrifice, but that seemed pretty small when compared to Kim's potentially life altering choice.I really liked the glimpse of the shifter politics we saw--although they were also pretty frustrating at times. It really made the shifter hierarchy seem constrictive and prone to misuse. The reasons that were eventually given for Brian's defense (or lack thereof) were quite interesting. I didn't really see that coming, but I liked it!I liked getting to know the secondary characters. Sean's real struggle to reconcile his role in the pack with the impact it has on his family tugged at my heartstrings. I also really loved Connor--he was adorable. I think my favorite secondary characters have to be Liam's dad, Dylan, and their neighbor, Glory. I feel sort of bad for Glory as things currently stand and hope that their storyline continues to develop in the next book.Liam was a fun character for the most part. I liked the way he would lay his Irish on thick occasionally. It amused me that it irked Kim so much. I liked how laid back and matter of fact about his circumstances he was. Especially when I learned how his family ended up being collared. It would have made no sense to portray him any other way. Having said that, I still liked the hidden anguish over it that he showed at the end. His decision there made him seem extremely strong, although I fear for the future of the shifters.Kim was a little more irritating than Liam, although I still ended up mostly liking her. She started out feeling real with her fear and determination but quickly fit herself to the standard PNR heroine mold. It's not necessarily a bad mold, but it makes them pretty interchangeable. I thought I'd see more of Kim's drive and passion for her work, but it really just felt like a plot device to me.That leads into some of my issues with the book. For one thing, when exactly was Kim going to actually be a lawyer? It seemed awfully easy for her to live in a vacuum other than a token visit or two to her office. That's another thing--what company allows their employees to have random companions while they work? I'm not talking about just shifters, I'm talking about anyone hanging out in your workplace all day long for no reason and with no prior approval. That seemed pretty fantastical to me. I really wish that the author would have set the relationship over a longer timeline. It didn't really make me think much of Kim when she compromised her case by screwing with a lead. Maybe that could have happened a bit further down the road than a day or two after their first meeting? Another turn off was Kim's incessant comparison of Liam to Abel--it jarred me out of the narrative each time I read about it.The end was an incredible disappointment for me. That's the reason everything magically fixed itself in their relationship??? I don't know whether to be repelled by Kim who thought that that would fix everything or to be appalled by Liam who proved her right."}, {"userName": "Laura the Highland Hussy", "userReviewDate": "Jan 18, 2010", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/2043222-laura-the-highland-hussy", "userReview": "Re-posted on http://www.gotfiction.com/book-review...I loved this book!

Legally shifters aren't able to get high paid jobs or buy luxury items. Proprietors are allowed to ban shifters from their premises and racism against them is tolerated because they're \"animals\". They're an oppressed people forced to wear collars that suppress their more aggressive animal personality traits and when they think about or are about to act out violence, are shocked by debilitating pain. Humans can hurt them but they can't defend themselves. It's disgusting. I abhor that kind of behaviour.But then you read to the closing pages and you begin to understand why most shifters accepted the collars in the first place, after their existence was discovered 20 years ago. They were truly animals: killing cubs because they wanted to f*** their mother, murdering their rivals for food, territory or just because they felt threatened. Now, they're forced to live in communities (by law and for protection), their fertility rate has gone up (though their birth rate is still fairly low), they co-operate with one another and their race is no longer on the brink of extinction, after previously being hunted down \"like the animals they are\".The cultural differences between the human and shifter communities are highlighted by Kim's and Liam's growing relationship. There was much they became confused over or misunderstood about each other's races. I enjoyed seeing those differences but the physical ones made me laugh. Kim asked Liam if he had a belly button, of course he had one but then Glory mentioned extra-large condoms... and then we found out why - 11 inches! OMFG!Erm... What was I going to say next? Oh, yes... yes, Yes, YES! Sorry.I wasn't particularly fond of the main couple. Okay, I really like Liam. Physically speaking, yum! Personality, a very kind and charming man. It was Kim, I think. She was... I don't know, she wasn't a horrible person but I doubt we'd be good friends, more like acquaintances. I'm not sure about the chemistry between them, sometimes it was great and others, not so much.The secondary characters were brilliant. Connor is sooooo cute! I just wanted to reassure him by squeezing the air out of his lungs with plenty of hugs and protect him from anyone who wanted to cause him harm, though I wasn't sure if I wanted to mother him or.... you know. ;)Glory - major Buffy flashback. They may not be the same person but they both shove their sexuality in people's faces and say whatever comes to mind, no matter who it hurts. And that's where their similarities end, despite my worry that she'd become the predictable villain, betraying her neighbours, alpha & lover. I never believed Glory hurt people just to hurt them, she didn't \"glory\" in it. It felt more like a defence to keep everyone except Dylan at arm's length. Liam's father, Dylan, that poor man. He'd lost his mate, his son, and his daughter-in-law. He was about to lose his alpha position in his community, was guilt-ridden over his affair with Glory and the way he treated her, and he was constantly goaded and humiliated by Fergas, the top Alpha, and was being pressured into challenging him to ensure the safety of his community. He had a big secret and it was so sad when it was revealed. Liam was crushed but he handled it with grace and respect. Thankfully, their father-son relationship managed to survive.So to sum up: great world-building and secondary characters. Clich\u00e9d writing, in places, got in the way of my enjoyment. The plot was interesting and tied into the world building and character development perfectly. I was completely surprised by the big reveal. Liam was one tough cookie to overcome his instincts and return to his former life. I will definitely be reading the the sequel Primal Bonds for the stoically quiet and tortured story of Sean (Liam's brother) although I'm not a fan of the fae but his woman's only half-fae, hopefully that'll make a difference."}, {"userName": "Sophia Triad", "userReviewDate": "Apr 04, 2016", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/44642860-sophia-triad", "userReview": "Once upon a time, there was a little girl called Kim and a big bad shifter called Liam - only the girl was a strong minded lawyer and the shifter was not really that bad.And he used to have a castle in Ireland but now he lived in a very small, poor home somewhere in US and loved drinking Guinness.

Years! But I finally cracked it this weekend and I'm kicking myself for not getting on board earlier.First an admission. I love shifters. I'm more a shifter girl than a vampire girl. Vampires -- usually -- are dead. That kind of bothers me. Oh, I can get over it for Bones, Spade, Vlad and Mencheres, but mostly ... ew. That said, not every shifter story is good. I've read a lot of stinkers, which has made me leery of starting anything new when I have my favorites I can trust. So I was nervous to start this book written by one of my favorite historical romance authors. Silly me. She's good at this too! It's Austin, Texas and the shifters of the world have come out. Rather than trying to integrate them in society, they were hunted in some countries and then herded into their own towns in the US. Liam Morrisey, his brother, his nephew, and his father, all live in the \"Shiftertown\" on the outskirts of Austin. Kim (last name irrelevant and I forgot it anyway) is an attorney working to save the life of a shifter accused of the murder of his human girlfriend. Since the shifter won't talk to her she's got to find other ways of getting information and she finds herself face-to-face with Liam. Immediate attraction, insta-love, but it works. The shifter likely couldn't have murdered his human girlfriend because all the shifters wear collars that cause them intense pain when they feel rage or the instinct to kill. This is all part of the fascinating world building that pulls the reader in. The shifters present one face to society, but they have a very different life beyond the facade. They're oppressed, that's for sure, but they're also healthier in many ways than their oppressors.Liam and Kim click. By the end I totally believe the insta-love and I can't wait to see what happens in the world as this book not only launches the series, but launches a world game-changer as well. I've already bought the second book of the series and plan to start reading it today. This is a 4.5 read.

There were times when I found myself saying, \"oh come on.\" I might try another one just to see if it was these particular characters that I didn't like."}, {"userName": "Holly", "userReviewDate": "Aug 23, 2010", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/2908833-holly", "userReview": "I thought this book was absolutely wonderful!!

It has everything that I enjoy in a good paranormal romance. Let me give you a small list; some violence,(lets just say this book is not for the faint of heart in some parts), some humor, a mystery, excitement, sizzling hot sex, and a shape shifting world unlike I have never read before. Here is a small list of things I liked; Liam and Kim have the right amount of sizzle, each is stubborn at times, then they are totally working together in their romance. So you don\u2019t get to much of roll over and give in or stubborn in either one. I also like how the shape shifting world is explained not to over the top, plus it doesn\u2019t take away form the romance or storyline. I like how the claiming of mates is done, it\u2019s very different from most shape shifter books.Here is a little about what I like on Liam and Kim. I love my alphas to have respect to all those around him and Liam has that. As a hot alpha he can bring down the best of them, but never disrespects his family or friends. Kim is wonderful the way she can stand up to the shape shifters, but still have a heart for all that\u2019s around her in the shape shifting town. I also liked,Sean and Conner, Liam\u2019s brothers. They are very hot.The only drawback was Kim at some points keeps comparing Liam and Able to each other, it\u2019s not much, but it still got under my skin.This was a very hot sexy PNR with all the right stuff for me. Now, I just need the next book\u2026\u2026"}, {"userName": "Denisa", "userReviewDate": "Nov 22, 2015", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/14215152-denisa", "userReview": "3.5 Cute, relaxing read.It's everything you would expect from a paranormal, shifter romance.

If they don\u2019t want to face immediate death, they must were a fae-made collar, one that expands when they shift so it is always on them. This collar supposedly keeps the shifters from acting violent, giving them severe pain if they cross that line.Kim Fraser is an attorney who has been handed a shifter murder case, the first time in twenty years that a shifter has been on trial. Brian has been accused of murdering his human girlfriend, but as Kim collects evidence, she is pretty sure Brian is innocent. She goes to a local shifter Brian recommends, Liam Morrisey who she knows can help her gather support for her cause.Liam is second in command of the alpha pack, his father Dylan is the master, second only to the leader, Fergus. Dylan doesn\u2019t do small talk, and Fergus is feared by everyone, so most come straight to Liam with any problems. Liam lives with his father, his brother Sean and his nephew Conner in Shiftertown. Kim is frightened to enter Shiftertown, but she soon realizes it is a town like any other. Kids are playing in the front yards, people are swimming. She also witnesses the discriminations against them first hand. It is hard for many shifters to find suitable employment. They also are not allowed advanced cell phones or cable television, for fear more knowledge will make them a bigger threat to humans.Liam and Kim have an instant attraction, and Liam starts sharing secrets about the shifters that he trusts Kim will never release to other humans. When Fergus gets wind of a human nosing around the shifters, he gets involved and things start to get messy. Liam will do anything to protect Kim, even if that means going up against his father and shifter law.Besides Pride Mates, I\u2019ve read two other books by Jennifer Ashley. Mortal Temptation, an erotic romance written under her pen name Allyson James which I did not like. Then last year I read her historical romance, The Madness of Lord Ian Mackenzie and it is absolutely one of my favorite books I have read. So, I was very interested to read a paranormal romance by her \u2013 unfortunately I am not a fan.My biggest problem is with Liam and Kim. In some paranormal books I have read, the shifter\u2019s animal mates without the human having much say so I can understand the immediate \u201cmine\u201d attitude and quick attraction. That is not necessarily the case here. Liam, the human is attracted to Kim and in less than 24 hours he is professing undying love and devotion to her.It struck him suddenly that he\u2019d been waiting for something like this. Maybe all his life. He\u2019d told himself he\u2019d passed up potential mates to give other Shifter males a chance at happiness, but he realized now that he\u2019d simply not found a woman he wanted to be with. Easy to be altruistic when he wasn\u2019t making much of a sacrifice.But when this sassy human female had walked into his office yesterday, with her blouse buttons straining, her short gray skirt smooth over her sweet rump, when she\u2019d started laying out a heated, well-reasoned argument why he should help her before Liam could even speak, his well-ordered world had overturned.For Kim\u2019s part, she is a well educated lawyer, and Brian and Liam are the first shifters she has ever met. She repeatedly says she doesn\u2019t know a lot about shifter culture and she is somewhat scared and hesitant around them. Yet, she allows this romance to happen and even though she doesn\u2019t have control of the actual moment Liam bonds with her, she accepts it and just goes with it. I just don\u2019t buy it. The character of Kim also tries to come off sassy and fearless, and I read her more disjointed and annoying.I also thought the mystery surrounding Brian in prison and the resulting confrontation with Fergus and others to be anti-climatic. In what should have been an intense scene with Fergus, fizzled. I had no investment in Brian sitting in prison, no reason to root for him to get out. There is also an overabundance of lustful thoughts between Liam and Kim. I am all for sexy glances and appreciative remarks between the protagonists, but it didn\u2019t matter what situation Liam and Kim were in \u2013 whether they were being threatened with violence or working on Brian\u2019s case, there are constant sexual thoughts and it really took away from the story.I did enjoy the supporting characters of Dylan and Connor. Dylan lost his mate years ago and is struggling with accepting a new love. He is also getting older and losing that edge he needs to stay dominant in the pack. Conner on the other hand is very young, and eager to show off his skills, although he is strong and with time will hone his muscles, he is quick to temper and quick to show immature emotion, which I thought played off really well again the other mature, dominant males.Pride Mates is a disappointing paranormal romance. I am still eagerly anticipating the next in her Mackenzie historical romance series, and I think I will be sticking with her in that genre only."}, {"userName": "Cindyg", "userReviewDate": "Feb 07, 2010", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/2025232-cindyg", "userReview": "I really enjoyed the first installment of Shifters Unbound.

Shifters had made their presence known to the world and 20 years ago they were given collars to control their animal instincts and keep them in line. The collars, made by a 1/2 Fae and half human, were to keep the humans safe. Knowing this Kim is determined to fight for her client's freedom. So sure of her client's innocence she is willing to face the unfamiliar Shifter world to prove it.Liam Morrissey was the man that Kim was told to go see if she had any way of proving her client's innocence. He was the \"go-to\" guy according to her client. Liam was an Irish Feline-Shifter and managed a Shifter bar on the edge of Shiftertown. Shiftertown were where the Shifters lived.When both Liam and Kim started being stalked by a feral Shifter, Liam trusted only himself to provide her protection. The only problem was whether or not she would allow him to.The main reason that I liked this book so much might sound weird to some. I liked it because as Kim and Liam's relationship blossoms, racism was addressed. Now you may say that that's an odd take on a PNR but you have to see it my way. As a bi-racial woman I am not unfamiliar with discrimination and it's a hot topic with me. The way that the Shifters were treated by the government is not unlike our own governmental history. Today, even in our supposed \"enlightened age\" prejudice and discrimination against people who are different still happens. Case in point? The treatment of Japanese-American citizens in WWII, the encampment of Native Americans in reservations, the Civil Rights Movement, as well as the treatment of homosexuals are all prime examples.Another reason That I liked this book is very simple. This book is yet another example of Ashley's excellent and spectacular writing."}, {"userName": "Laura (Kyahgirl)", "userReviewDate": "Feb 04, 2013", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/2906277-laura-kyahgirl", "userReview": "3.5/5; 4 stars; B+Maybe its because I had low expectations based upon the prequel I read but I enjoyed this book more than I thought I would.

Assigned to defend a shifter on murder charges, up and coming defense lawyer, Kim Fraser, is in over her head and seeks the help of shifter leader, Liam Morrissey. Liam\u2019s charm and wit cannot conceal the undercurrents of power that characterize him and Kim will need his strength and protection both to unravel the mystery and for her very survival.Review:An interesting take on the Shapeshifter premise. This is the first book I\u2019ve read in which the shifters\u2019 animal traits overshadow their human ones and it is an intriguing perspective.The conflicts and prejudices that characterize humans/shifter interaction and the social rules, hierarchies and norms of the shifter community are exceedingly detailed and add credence to the world established in the book. The manner in which Ashley presents the discrimination against the shifters and the problematic ethics of the collar is particularly thought provoking. The characters are wonderful and the romance sizzles. Kim's honesty, courage and stubbornness make her particularly engaging and Liam can charm the pants off anyone. However, there are a few things that bothered me. First, Liam and Kim have an immediate attraction and there is very little development of their relationship before they are mated. Second, Kim does not seem to fully grasp the significance of events going on around her, and lastly, the constant physical contact between all of the characters, not only the primary couple, takes some getting used to. The supporting characters are also appealing, especially Liam\u2019s tortured brother, his emotionally distant father, and my personal favorite, his boisterous nephew, Connor. One character who did not live up to his initial characterization is the villain. While he is a nasty piece of work, he does not evoke anything more than mild distaste and never becomes the uber-villain that would contribute to the tension and suspense of the final confrontation.The story is the weak point in the book. It would have been better if more effort has been put into the murder mystery and Kim\u2019s investigation, especially since it turns out to be a pivotal aspect of the plot \u2013 I won\u2019t say anymore so as not to ruin it.Overall, this is an entertaining book and I look forward to reading the next installment."}, {"userName": "D.G.", "userReviewDate": "Jan 31, 2015", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/210123-d-g", "userReview": "**3.5 stars**This was more deep than I thought it would be. It dealt with discrimination, instincts vs. reason, love of family and sacrifice for the good of all. Throw in a heroine who was smart and brave without being TSTL and you have us a winner.In this world, Shifters came out 20 years ago and they are treated like second class citizens. They must wear a Collar to control their violent tendencies and they live in ghetto-like communities, are not allowed high paying jobs or even technology like iPhones or cable. So imagine the uproar when a Shifter is accused of killing his human girlfriend. Being found guilty means the automatic death penalty so his defense attorney decides to do whatever it takes to fight for his innocence.Kim quickly gets embroiled in the life of the Shifters and realizes that with all her research, she knew next to nothing about them. The weakness of this book is that everything with Kim happens very fast - she's mated with Liam within a few days and seems to go along with a lot of crazy things that happened. Unlike the Shifters, her background was a bit cliche as romance novels go - the curvy woman who's dating a man who doesn't really appreciate her.The Shifters on the other hand, were really well drawn. A dying race who sacrificed their freedom for the sake of their children and their future, who loved their family and who fight the instincts of their animal nature. I loved the relationship of Liam and his father, brother and nephew.I'm definitely continuing this series."}, {"userName": "chucklesthescot", "userReviewDate": "May 24, 2010", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/3426724-chucklesthescot", "userReview": "This is the typical paranormal romance involving smart human girl falling for sexy dangerous shifter. It was well written, not over-descriptive and a decent fluffy read if you want to gloss over a few things. Another plus point were the side characters of Glory, Dylan, Connor and Sean. Kim, honey you are meant to be smart but you decide to stand in a room full of hostile shifters and mouth off to the Alpha which could get your lover and his family killed? You were thinking 'Liam just shut her the hell up!'That really grated my cheese but not as much as her failure to work out what being mated to Liam actually meant. Think about it you ditz!!! What was the point of Brian? You hear about him but never see him and his whole story ends up as a wee footnote near the end which seems a tad pointless. The so-called fight at the end with Fergus was just piss poor to put it bluntly. A total let down as if the author was running out of time or couldn't be bothered seeing the story through. This book could have been really good.
