It is easy to get lost in its opening 100 pages or so \u2013 not lost as in confused, lost as if in a strange waking dream, or the sleepy thoughts before slumber takes over. At first it is a story of an eccentric woman and a good man, and the love that brings them together. It is a novel that is dense with detail and characterization from beginning to end, but I had such an odd time with that first part. Perhaps it was due to that odd woman. Ariah is the most solipsistic of characters, dreadful and admirable and fascinating and frustrating. Depending on my mood, she either totally absorbed me or she put me to sleep. It was an interesting experience. At times I considered giving up because it was also a challenging experience and I\u2019m not sure I was in the right frame of mind. I\u2019m glad I didn\u2019t! The story of Ariah and her suitor Dick Burnaby ends in two remarkable chapters that lit me right up: one about Ariah\u2019s acceptance of a marriage proposal, detailed in prose so sharp and fierce and idiosyncratic that it woke all of the different parts of my mind; the other a much longer chapter depicting the early years of the marriage itself \u2013 a chapter full of loveliness and wisdom, passion and sadness, all the things I needed to suddenly become fully re-engaged with the novel.The story after that first 100 pages is quite different. More traditional, well as far as Oates can ever be traditional. It is a sort of miniature family saga that focuses on Ariah\u2019s three children, their loves and lives and ambitions and failures, and the battle that is being waged over the poison that has been dumped in the Niagara Falls region for decades. It becomes one of those Big Novels about Important Issues... but yet it still stays intimate. I was able to feel anger at corporate cupidity and the crass banality at the heart of many evil men, but The Falls' biggest attribute even amidst all of that is its brilliant characterization. The children of Ariah and Dick Burnably are amazing \u2013 and amazingly real \u2013 creations.The novel troubled me a bit, specifically around Ariah\u2019s later characterization. It made wonder... does Oates have a problem with women? I never expected to feel that way about one of my favorite authors, but the fact remains that many, many of Oates\u2019 most vital female characters are either delicate victims or fascinating monsters. Is there no inbetween for her \u2013 and are there no genuine heroines? She has no problem in making Dick Burnaby and his two male children perfectly heroic in their perfectly human ways. They manage to be both real and good. Not so with Ariah. Why did she have to be transformed into such a horrorshow, such a toxic and repulsive figure? Was Oates even aware that what she was creating was not someone to be admired for her independence and eccentricity, but rather someone to be loathed for her small-mindedness, her tunnel vision, her mistreatment of her children? I dunno. Well, it was a disturbing realization but it cannot be denied that Ariah Burnaby is a unique creation. She's a great addition to the JCO gallery of Monster-Women.Oates is known to be chilly writer, at times even callous or cruel. Not so much with The Falls. With the possible exception of the monstrous, deluded Ariah, her protagonists are written with much kindness and empathy. Even better, I am happy to report that this novel somehow finds its way to grace in the end. It was well-earned. There was a small moment near the end when one nearly-broken character takes another character\u2019s hands \u2013 big, rough, scarred paws that have felt and even caused a lot of hurt \u2013 and she realizes that they are the most beautiful hands she\u2019s ever seen. I read that part and thought to myself, This is why I love reading\u2026 these sublime human moments, these moments of transcendence. The Falls is full of such moments."}, {"userName": "Heather", "userReviewDate": "Nov 23, 2007", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/635966-heather", "userReview": "I read The Falls for book club. I was looking forward to reading it, given its roots in historical events and my past reading of her novel, We Were the Mulvaneys. The Falls was, hands down, the worst novel I have read for years. If I could, I would give it 1/4 of a star. The first few hundred pages are horrid: adjective after adjective describing nothing. The characters are boring, generally unbelievable, and have no depth. To her credit, Joyce Carol Oates offers the reader moments of promise: description of Niagara Falls during the 1950s and the events surrounding the Love Canal lawsuit. Unfortunately, Oates breaks her promise, and instead focuses on the lives of the family members caught up in the time and the lawsuit: members the reader could care less about. I waded (more like skimmed) page after page of this novel for my book club (otherwise I would never have gone beyond page 90) only to find myself laughing hysterically by the end. The book goes like this: pages and pages of meaningless prose and flowery adjectives, during which moments of possibility and intellect actually appear, only to be abandoned as quickly as it was presented in place of more meaningless prose, until the reader is hit on the head with the end. Oates must have been jolted from her depression, or must have been as bored with her own book as I was (or she was late for a deadline) because she packs a full novel in the last 1/3 of the book - introducing new characters who are as bland as the originals - and does absolutely nothing with them. Seriously. A total disaster of a book."}, {"userName": "Chiara White", "userReviewDate": "May 06, 2018", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/4544857-chiara-white", "userReview": "Impetuoso, eccessivo e travolgente, proprio come le cascate del Niagara... Non era in programma leggere questo libro, no. E\u2019 in ebook e DEVO leggere i miei libri di carta. Ma. Recentemente ho letto un altro libro della Oates e i riferimenti a questo mi hanno stuzzicato. Poi, ho vagheggiato l\u2019idea di visitare le cascate del Niagara, una delle meraviglie del mondo. Allora ho iniziato a sbirciarlo, cos\u00ec, tanto per fare, e mi sono trovata immediatamente sul bordo del baratro, lanciata dentro la furia delle acque. L\u2019incipit \u00e8 davvero una specie di calamita che ti cattura che ti impedisce di lasciare le pagine: un uomo si getta nelle cascate e tu cadi nel gorgo con lui. Tutto \u00e8 eccessivo, in alcuni casi ci sono anche cadute di stile (ahim\u00e9 la scena \u201ctombale\u201d), ma \u00e8 appassionante, quasi a livello morboso e quasi come una soap opera, con tutti i colpi di scena annessi e connessi, buoni, cattivi e perfino un lato ecologista.

Dalla lettura ne esco zuppa, con tutte le scarpe, ma ne \u00e8 valsa la pena, farsi travolgere dal tanto e troppo della Oates che questa volta mi ha incollato ai destini della dannata famiglia Burnaby e dannata io con loro.http://it.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cascate_..."}, {"userName": "Barbara Wahl", "userReviewDate": "Feb 01, 2018", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/20784645-barbara-wahl", "userReview": "Illusioni otticheGrande libro.

Her bleak future becomes miraculously bright when Dirk Burnaby, a handsome, wealthy bon vivant with an altruistic heart, falls in love with the media-dubbed Widow-Bride. Their rapturous happiness is shadowed only by Ariah's illogical conviction over the years that Dirk will leave her and their three children someday. Her unreasonable fear becomes self-fulfilling when her increasingly unstable behavior, combined with Dirk's obsessed but chaste involvement with Nina Olshaker, a young mother who enlists his help in alerting the city fathers to the pestilential conditions in the area later to be known as Love Canal, opens a chasm in their marriage. His gentle heart inspired by a need for justice, Dirk takes on the powerful, corrupt politicians, his former peers and pals, in a disastrous lawsuit that ruins him socially and financially and results in his death. Oates adroitly addresses the material of this \"first\" class action lawsuit and makes the story fresh and immediate. \"In the end, all drama is about family,\" a character muses, and while the narrative occasionally lapses into melodrama in elucidating this theme, Oates spins a haunting story in which nature and humans are equally rapacious and self-destructive."}, {"userName": "Snotchocheez", "userReviewDate": "Dec 07, 2009", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/1899836-snotchocheez", "userReview": "JCO is one of those writers you either love or hate. I happen to love most everything she does; \"The Falls\" is no exception, although I really started to get bored with her story set-up. Once she finally got the ball rolling (about 60 pages into it) it was cinematic in scope and really ranks high among her best works. Set in the 40's through the 70's in (duh) Niagara Falls, NY, \"The Falls\" describes the falls' eerie, almost preternatural effect on a family, practically destroying it. I found myself skim-reading through much of the repetitive flashback dialog, but at the same time the vision this novel left me with was cinematic in scope (I kept imagining it as it would play \"on the big screen\")."}, {"userName": "Jennifer Odza", "userReviewDate": "Apr 27, 2010", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/2162272-jennifer-odza", "userReview": "This book was given to me as a gift, otherwise I would have never had it in my home, especially after reading \"We Were the Mulvaneys\" which I found to be an equally horrible read. I felt a little compelled to read this because it is set in the Niagra area, where I have visited many times.There are two main problems with this book, and they permeate the book unfortunately. The first is that Oates' characters are not in any way genuine. Their reactions, motivations, what they say and do all ring false. I hope each time that I read a fictional work to be transported and to feel in some way that the characters might be real people. This absolutely does not happen in \"The Falls.\" Quite the opposite happens, again and again I thought the author had no human understanding. The second problem is that it is in sorry need of an edit. For example, there were way too many descriptions of the main character's eye color of \"gasoline green.\" Annoying both for the repetition and because it is a terrible description. There were many instances of pages introducing a place or character, and then a few pages later a sentence or paragraph introducing them again. What I surmise is that no one was willing to read the book from first to last page, and therefore would not catch the redundancies.If you have not yet started reading this book please don't!

Ariah lives her life almost as a fugitive, constantly looking over her shoulder, reading into things said as proof that she is unworthy of affection. She becomes brittle and nearly unapproachable. By protecting herself, she seems to live life in the shadows, barely participating, but an influence nonetheless."}, {"userName": "Graham Wilhauk", "userReviewDate": "Jul 31, 2017", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/48243908-graham-wilhauk", "userReview": "This was good, but after ADORING \"We Were the Mulvaneys\" by Joyce Carol Oates, I wanted this one to be a bit better than it was. I was really close at one point to giving this a 4 out of 5 stars. The beginning of this book, mainly the first 100 pages, were a MASSIVE blow to the book and the story told in the first 100 pages could have been told in 50 pages. I just couldn't get into it at first. However, Part 2 came around and I FELL IN LOVE WITH THE BOOK. From page 115 to around 270 (Part 2's page numbers), I was adoring this book. It was incredibly well told and unfolded the doomed fate of this family that was ultimately ignited by tragedy. By this point I was thinking this book had to mess up pretty badly to lose its 4 out of 5 star rating. Well, things got messed up pretty badly in Part 3. Not to say it was bad, in fact it still was decent and better than the beginning, but it strangely switched narrators and made the book feel unreliable. I love a good unreliable narrator, but this book shouldn't of been told in first person. Part of the reason why Part 2 was such a brilliant story was how it was written in a third person POV so that everything could get tackled in a clean yet interesting way. I felt like Part 3 didn't give me enough. It just went on and on about stuff we either already knew or is pretty much common sense based on the situation at hand. So, I didn't LOVE \"The Falls,\" but I certainly loved parts of it. Joyce Carol Oates is a fantastic author and when she is good, she is a talent barely any authors can match to. Though she can drag on and I feel like this book could have been done a lot better. It will have to take some more great novels for her to get on my favorites list, and this just wasn't that. If you are interested, check it out! Though if you just can't care less about what this is about, I would say skip it. I am giving this one a 3.5 out of 5 stars."}, {"userName": "Ron Charles", "userReviewDate": "Sep 03, 2009", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/1384944-ron-charles", "userReview": "You can't help pitying the people who show up in the novels of Joyce Carol Oates. From the first page, you sense that they're going to be known to death, literally splayed by her insight. And before you realize it, she's done the same thing to us. For 40 years, she's coyly enticed us with the gothic details of ordinary life and then - when it's too late - pinned us on the sharp point of her wisdom.I read \"The Falls,\" her latest novel, in what seemed like one held breath. Set around Niagara, the story reflects all the romance, mystery, and terror of that spectacular waterfall. It's a great confluence of tones - grotesque and domestic, tragic and comic. The currents of various styles and points of view blend together in a way that can't possibly work, but does.How else to begin at Niagara Falls but with a honeymoon - and a suicide? Ariah Littrell's desperation to be married had reached a fever pitch, which is pretty much the mental condition she maintains for the rest of her life. Though she's terrified of sex and disgusted by her own body, at 29 \"she would have gladly traded her soul for an engagement ring,\" Oates writes. The daughter of a prominent minister, she's thrilled to be marrying another minister, even if she doesn't really love him, even if she knows he can't love her, \"an old maid.\"The morning after their first night together - an evening of consummate humiliation - her new husband answers the call of the roaring water outside their bridal suite and throws himself over. It's a classic Oates moment - hypnotically awful, the kind of slow-motion disaster you can't take your eyes off.Ariah, long determined to be the perfect wife, immediately recasts herself as \"The Widow Bride of the Falls,\" maintaining a seven-day vigil while police search for her new husband's body.The hotel manager, desperate to downplay this common \"accident\" as gracefully as possible, appeals for help to a friend, a charming, well-connected lawyer named Dirk Burnaby. But poor Dirk is drawn to Ariah the way people are drawn to the water, and he falls head over heels for this anxious, brittle woman.The heart of the novel is the story of their marriage and the family they build together through the 1950s and early '60s. Dirk loves his wife and their three children, his law firm grows more prosperous, and the Burnabys enjoy an idyllic suburban existence. Except that Ariah wields a kind of psychological brutality, cutting away anything unpleasant, anything that troubles her, such as memories of her first husband, news of the world, the complexity of her new husband's legal work, neighbors' friendly invitations, even telephone calls. It's all banished in a flurry of anxious protests and ferocious pleading. She alternately shrieks and cajoles, stares down anyone who crosses her, or runs from the room with hands over her ears.Ariah excites the same perverse fascination as Amanda Wingfield in \"The Glass Menagerie.\" In fact, she's a kind of middle-class companion to Tennessee Williams's classic mother-monster, though she's trapped in a mythical present instead of a mythical past. She draws her children around her even as she repels them, constantly calling attention to her anxieties with ceaseless, ludicrous denials that anything is wrong.Dirk, meanwhile, finds himself compelled to represent a young woman who claims that her neighborhood, along an area known as Love Canal, has been poisoned by chemical waste. There's little precedent for environmental liability, and Dirk knows that a conspiracy of business and political forces will make justice almost impossible to attain, but he pursues the case with a dogged idealism that threatens his business, his family, and his own life.\"The Falls\" is written in a strange, fluid cycle of voices, a blending of these characters' thoughts and the author's searing, ironic judgment. Sometimes, characters speak for themselves, or the three Burnaby children speak in a kind of composite voice. Some sections employ the repetitions of a chorus. Others sound like newspaper accounts. One odd chapter reads like an eroticized ghost story.Oates handles all this with winning confidence, moving through intimate details just as deftly as she re-creates a crucial period in environmental law. Most of the mysteries here are tied up, but others are lost in the mist. When she tells the story of Dirk's grandfather, an acrobat who once walked across the Falls on a wire, I couldn't help thinking of the daredevil feat she braves herself with this novel.Ultimately, corporate thugs and their crooked judges can't keep chemicals from oozing out of the ground, any more than Ariah can keep the past from seeping into her children's lives. The desperate struggle to hide and the desperate struggle to uncover collide in these pages with gripping effect.Surprisingly, though it's full of creepy, ominous energy, by the end this is a novel of forgiveness, of learning to accept what's oddest and cruelest about those we love. It's a scary, perceptive portrayal of family life, particularly the burdens parents force on their children and the way love can make those burdens, if not light, then at least bearable.http://www.csmonitor.com/2004/0914/p1..."}, {"userName": "Lectrice H\u00e9r\u00e9tique", "userReviewDate": "Jan 15, 2011", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/996682-lectrice-h-r-tique", "userReview": "Je voulais d\u00e9couvrir cet auteur depuis longtemps et mon seul regret c\u2019est de ne pas l\u2019avoir fait plus t\u00f4t !Les Chutes est un roman poignant et d\u2019une richesse psychologique folle.

For 120 pages, the book was just shy of glued to my hand, and I could not put it down. Then, for the next 200 pages, I could barely pick it back up, to continue. By the mid-300s, I was hoping there would be a chemical explosion at one of the factories and all of the characters would die, putting me out of my misery.I had never before read Joyce Carol Oates, so I don't know if this inconsistency is typical, or rare. Her writing is both technical and inspired, to the point of my making comparisons of her style to that of the Brontes. But, something happened to the powerful storytelling of the first section, and it never returned, nor did my interest."}, {"userName": "Henrik", "userReviewDate": "Jun 07, 2009", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/573337-henrik", "userReview": "Not exactly the kind of story I usually read but it is good to read \"beyond\" one's immediate pleasures--and this novel by Oates is an example of why that's a good idea. And I know I will return to Oates every once in a while, since I enjoy her distinct voice and style.The title \"The Falls\" is well chosen, as it covers the layered \"falls\" herein. On the surface it is, obviously a reference to the Niagara Falls, where just about the whole story takes place, but it also covers the various kinds of \"falls from grace\" and disappointments taking place throughout the story. It is a tale dripping with pain, mourning and sadness.Oates is known for her stories evolving around the myriad aspects of \"the American Dream.\" I'd say that goes for this story too, although it generally takes a backseat and lets the more generic topic of family/relationship elements take center stage. We follow a family and what happens to it in the years 1950 to 1978 (with the 1960s mostly left a blank). All the way through with the woman Ariah as the revolving point.I greatly admire the way Oates gives us the story chronologically by seamlessly jumping \"on the shoulder\" of each character, at a crucial moment in their life. Telling things from that character's point of view for a while, in that person's unique voice & through that person's perception. That is a masterstroke! It starts with Ariah and her first husband's suicide on their honeymoon--then we see things from his perspective, up to the suicide at the Niagara Falls--then from his second husband, the wealthy Dirk Burnaby... And after his tragic death (officially an accident at the Falls, but really a hit orchestrated by powerful companies and individuals who dislike him forcing a trial case against them & their heavy polution of the area) we jump to the mid-to-late '70s, where we follow their three children. Who all one way or other have the shadow of their father's death hovering--plus their estranged mother's power over them.This story examines family ties and what can go terrible wrong, and the consequences thereof. It also tells a story of modern industry ruining a natural reserve (the Niagara Falls) and the people living there, be that physically, morally and whatnot.Ariah, in my opinion, is mad--and descends deeper and deeper into it, in avoidance of emotion and attachments to people, incl. her own children; and general denial of a lot of things. How this is portrayed is quite remarkable.The only \"but\" I really have to this story is that too many characters and incidents are \"left hanging\", having no real bearing on the story and its advancement as a whole, which annoys me. A little tidying up here would have been nice. To a certain degree I can understand why we get to see things from the perspective of the suicidal husband (after all, his act is the pivotal spin for what happens to Ariah and, hence, the family we then follow), but a character like the mysterious, strange Polish guy, Mr. Pankowski--what is that all about, really? We're never told. I even suspect he may even be Dirk himself! (His body is never found, you see.) But who knows? Adding color, and introducing persons as it happens in real life, is all fine, but it needs to be important to the story. Elements like these may have been intended as important (enough) to the story, but if so I fail to see a number of the relevances.There are times, however, where I recognized tidbits of information, so I am sure much of my complaining is simply due to my limited knowledge about a lot of things, regardless of advancement of the story itself. Here is one I did get: Ariah at some point remarks that she liked Elvis' singing, if not his style (rock'n'roll). At first this reference seemed offbeat to me, but then I figured that since it was less than a year since Elvis died (in real life and in the story's timeline) it actually made a kind of sense that Elvis would be a person who one--even one like Ariah--would refer to when talking about singing; his death was still fresh enough in people's mind. From a real-life consciousness perspective it made sense.All in all it was a wonderful read, well worth my time. No doubt about it.(Started reading this one today, August 16. Ended September 29.)"}, {"userName": "Robert", "userReviewDate": "Sep 07, 2007", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/234027-robert", "userReview": "The Falls was my first ever Joyce Carol Oates novel. I've read a few of her stories over the years, though none of them particularly stand out in my mind. I have vague but admiring memories of what is probably her most famous short story, frequently anthologized, called \"Where Are You Going, Where Have You Been?\" I know she's considered something of an icon in the fiction world, so I took that into this experience, expecting what's generally called \"literary fiction,\" and expecting it to be well done. How did it work out? I'd have to give The Falls a B-, as a novel (though I always shudder at the idea of critics, lazy dilettantes, essentially just readers willing to write a few opinionated words, grading the work of artists, who have gone to so much more trouble to actually create something). Why not a higher grade? Basically, I think The Falls has within it several good short stories, but that JCO is filling in the space between those with lots of material that not only doesn't feel very substantial, it's sometimes downright tedious. The best of the short stories in this novel, I think, is probably the one that opens it, about two people on their honeymoon: a shy, retiring, overly-intellectual minister's daughter and an overwrought, intense, overly-intellectual, closeted homosexual minister's son, roped into a loveless union by the harsh realities of social necessity. The problem with this really great story is that it's over just when you've gotten interested, and you're left wondering, What could the rest of all these unread pages possibly be about?The second story in the novel is nearly as good, about an unlikely romance, but once that story hits the top of its narrative arc, we're sort of set adrift for long stretches of time, most of which are expressed as something more like the literary equivalent of \"time passed.\" Eventually, the wobbly story tries to find some legs again with some historical turf: the Love Canal ecological disaster and the resulting legal cases. A not quite red herring of a romance simmers here, but seems to serve mainly as a distraction. This part of the book feels more like a thinly veiled essay about the machinery of society: how power and money can so easily collude to line the pockets of the already wealthy even (or maybe always) at the expense of the working class.Finally, we move on to another generation of protagonists, and you sense JCO running out of steam here. If they were to be included at all, these children probably deserve to be in their own novel, rather than plugged into the ending of someone else's story. Their stories do seem interesting, but they never quite generate enough interest, particularly since the attention must now be split between three children of our original protagonists, and must continue to include material about the first generation, as well. There just isn't enough room left for everyone to get their just due, at least in the way that JCO has established already (where a single night and the following morning get 60 very detailed pages). The book has a very ragged feel to it as it draws to its conclusion, an ending that seems dictated more by the conventions of length of literary fiction than by the demands of the story itself, as if JCO realized, or was warned by her editor, We can't really go past 400 pages, so you'd better wrap things up and tack on an epilogue."}, {"userName": "Sandra", "userReviewDate": "Sep 10, 2012", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/11916501-sandra", "userReview": "E\u2019 stato il mio primo incontro con Joyce Carol Oates e non sar\u00e0 l\u2019ultimo. Leggere questo libro \u00e8 stato al tempo stesso terribile e intrigante come fare un viaggio in nave sul percorso navigabile lungo il fiume Niagara.Le Cascate del Niagara: un maestoso fenomeno della natura, di una potenza impetuosa e travolgente tale che gli animi di chi si trova a Niagara Falls vengono attirati, in preda a una terrificante forza ipnotica, a perdersi nella nebbia uguale a quella formata da miliardi di gocce che si alzano dalla roboante massa d\u2019acqua che cade, da cui si odono suoni come le voci delle sirene di Ulisse.Una nebbia che avvolge le esistenze dei protagonisti, la famiglia Barnaby, formata da Ariah e Dirk e dai loro figli Chandler, Royall e Juliet. Ariah \u00e8 il personaggio dominante il romanzo dalla prima all\u2019ultima pagina, la sposa vedova delle Cascate, un personaggio controverso; nel bene e nel male ha esercitato su di me un fascino paragonabile a quello delle cascate.

Ho oscillato nel corso della lettura tra il fastidio verso questa donna all\u2019apparenza forte ma forse troppo fragile e l\u2019ammirazione, anche se ha predominato il primo. Ariah \u00e8 una donna che ha delle ossessioni che dominano i suoi pensieri e le sue azioni. \u201cDio non fa altro che giocare a dadi con l\u2019universo.

Il malessere che mi ha accompagnato nella lettura delle vicende di questa \u201cfamiglia maledetta\u201d si \u00e8 dissolto, cos\u00ec come la nebbia che si forma vicino alle cascate si dirada con l\u2019alzarsi del sole, quando, nel finale, sono comparsi arcobaleni sopra il fiume. \u201cLeggeri, fragilissimi, poco pi\u00f9 di un\u2019illusione ottica\u201d.

The writing is deep, and, though there were many times when I thought it seemed to go on a bit, I found myself still caught up in the rhythm of her astonishing prose. The central character, Ariah, is not a very likable character. On the first night of her honeymoon in Niagara Falls in the early 1950s, her new husband leaves their bed, walks to the Falls and throws himself over. Ariah finds the suicide note h left but destroys it without telling anyone. During the seven days that Ariah keeps watch as police search for his body, a young lawyer, Dirk Burnaby, keeps her company.A month later Ariah is back in Troy, NY when Burnaby shows up, tells her he can't get her out of his mind, and begs her to marry him. She does and they move back to Niagara Falls where Burnaby grew up in a prominent and affluent family. Burnaby's devotion to his wife is both admirable and baffling. They have three children though Ariah is never sure if their first-born son, Chandler, belongs to Dirk or her first husband, however unlikely that may seem. Throughout the years she continually hears stories about the \"Widow Bride,\" the sad young woman whose husband left her on their wedding night and \"fell\" into the gorge.With three small children and a successful law practice, Dirk makes a difficult decision, he decides to take the case of a group of working class people whose lives are being ruined by mysterious illnesses. They all live in an area known as Love Canal. It is an unfortunate decision because it destroys Dirk's standing in the community, and eventually, his life.The second half of the book is told from the points of view of each of their three children - Chandler, Royall, and Juliet -- as each seeks to find the truth of their father's life.This is a deep, dark, extraordinary book in which the Falls themselves become as much a character within the story as any of the others. It is not a book for everyone but I found it mesmerizing and I'm sure it will haunt me for a very long time."}, {"userName": "Jane", "userReviewDate": "Feb 12, 2011", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/4970507-jane", "userReview": "The woman in black intrigues me. When I read The Falls, I thought she was Nina Olshaker, recognizing Dirk in Royall, making love to Royall as she had not been able to do with his father. On the other hand, the scene in the cemetery is eerie and unreal enough to make a case for her being a phantom. Her diction reminded me of Claudine, but Claudine would have been much older and never would have worn those clothes, and her hair was blond, not black, and she was always impeccably coiffed and never barefoot. Nina is described as the Woman in Black in the \"Before\" chapter in part two. \"She was the Woman in Black. She was observing him, she was waiting to waylay him. She was patient, relentless. Waiting for him....\" Dirk forgot her name and \"imagined Death.\" Maybe the woman in black in the cemetery scene is Death, maybe Royall makes love with Death, but I prefer to think it is Nina twenty years later. On page 286 JCO writes \"And there was the woman in black waiting for him....\" On the next page she writes \"Royall realized that the woman must have been waiting for him.\" The Woman in Black in Part 2 too closely parallels the woman in black in Part 3 for it to be a coincidence. I really wanted Ms. Oates to confirm this when I met her at the book signing after her reading at the CHF. However, she did not. Her concern was elsewhere, and I am left to speculate, as I frequently am in the aftermath of her novels."}, {"userName": "John", "userReviewDate": "Aug 29, 2009", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/578392-john", "userReview": "My first JCO book and possibly my last. Some great ideas and stunning imagery, but The Falls got on my nerves pretty fast. Oates' pen tends to linger for pages (and pages and pages)on events that other writers would condense into one or two sentences. In particular, the play-by-play on hotel staff handling a woman whose husband just threw himself into Niagara Falls was excruciating. That Oates intermittently punctuates her descriptions by italicizing the mostly cliched inner thoughts of her characters was too much for me. Penelope Fitzgerald once said, \"I always feel the reader is very insulted by being told too much.\" Apparently, this is not a concern shared by Joyce Carol Oates. I waved the white flag around page 80. Perhaps if I had hung around longer, the Ariah character might have started to make sense and maybe I would have found that Oates fleshed out more complex reasons for her husband's suicide other than that he was gay in the 50s. In a pretty cool epigraph, Oates seems to be setting the stage for a mysterious suicide - that the Falls will cast a spell on an otherwise unlikely jumper. Instead her closeted gay husband premeditates his death in the hotel room, leaves a note, and makes a beeline for the falls. How uninteresting."}, {"userName": "Shawna", "userReviewDate": "Mar 16, 2008", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/263316-shawna", "userReview": "Joyce Carol Oates has become quite a name in the fiction world. I thought it was high time that I read one of her works. Unfortunately, my first foray was The Falls. Neither the characters, plot, nor writing left me particularly enthralled.

I didn't enjoy this one as much, but it's still well worth reading. I lived in the Buffalo Niagara area for 12 years, so I enjoyed all of the local color in this novel. In addition, a good deal of this story concerns the very early developments in the Love Canal case. I took a sociology class in college from a professor who wrote a book about the homeowner's group that formed in the wake of the lawsuits from a sociological perspective (we had to buy and read her book for the class, surprise, surprise), and found it a fascinating subject then, so I enjoyed Joyce Carol Oates fictionalization of it in the novel.

Her ability to tackle just about any genre continues to amaze me with each new book. Take, for example, the Falls, which begins as a sort of modern Greek Tragedy, before seamlessly transitioning into a ravishing romance, and then (later) a legal thriller that reads like a combination of Silent Spring and A Civil Action. While the themes in The Falls aren't as potent as those found in Foxfire, they're still well worth the four-hundred-plus pages Oates takes to explore them. More than that, The Falls is an entertaining, enjoyable read and demands less from the reader than some of Oates' other novels. While some might label that a disadvantage, I enjoyed this \"breather\" in my exploration of Oates' canon and think this book might make a perfect introduction for somebody new to Oates country."}, {"userName": "Stacey (wanderlustforwords)", "userReviewDate": "Apr 29, 2015", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/1861437-stacey-wanderlustforwords", "userReview": "I'm sad to have finished The Falls!

Niagara Falls in the \u201860\u2019s may have been the Love Capital of America but it was also the home of Love Canal, the most polluted industrial site that erupted and exposed the evil underbelly of crony capitalism.And yet this novel begins (and ends) as a love story: a young headstrong woman, Ariah Erskine, and her pastor husband who is hiding the secret of his sexuality go to the Falls on their honeymoon like most middle class Americans. Being forced to reveal his secret on their wedding night, the young husband takes his life at the Falls the following morning, thus establishing this modern Wonder of the World as an integral part of the Erskine-Burnaby family, forging character and destroying it. The love story continues with Ariah\u2019s second marriage to Dirk Burnaby, an idealistic lawyer from a local patrician family who takes on the corruption of his friends and gambling buddies when he discovers the level of pollution and the shocking number of deaths being attributed to Love Canal on the outskirts of the Falls. But love is always hard-fought and short-lived in this book, and it is for the progeny of Ariah and Dirk as well, for duty and class often clash, resulting in loss.The novel has a deliberate narrative style, much of it is told. The author takes control by relating the stories of her character\u2019s lives, detailing their inter-relationships, likes and dislikes. Much has been commented on the adjective-heaviness of this tale, and I have to agree, besides the stage directions and back story offered in parentheses is clumsy. And yet Oates is able to speak in the voices of her characters, forsaking proper grammar if and when needed. One is often forced to decide whether this is a generational story, a love story, or a tale of political intrigue, because all three themes interweave throughout the novel but take centre stage individually at times. The women are strong willed, hard-hearted, and even cruel: Claudine, the mother in law, is the classic upper-class bitch, Candace blackmails Ariah\u2019s son Royall to marry her by pretending to be pregnant, and the \u201cWoman in Black\u201d artfully seduces her men across the generations. Ariah herself emerges as a proud, dominating figure, unrelenting despite losing both husbands to the Falls. The men, by contrast, are weak, idealistic and prone to tragedy: Rev. Erskine and Dirk Burnaby, Ariah\u2019s son Chandler who puts himself in harm\u2019s way during hostage negotiations, and Dirk\u2019s nemesis, his uncle, who walked the Falls on a tightrope. Perhaps the Falls, Love Canal and the Woman in Black are intended as metaphors for death that stalks this multi-generational family. It is only in Aria\u2019s daughter Julia and her reticent boyfriend Stonecrop that we see the roles reversed between weakness and strength. The ending is a bit of a fizzle, an overdone tribute to Dirk Burnaby after the Love Canal lawsuit is finally settled. And yet I enjoyed this book for its bold indictment of capitalism taken to ridiculous lengths in a developed country, and for its depiction of the lives of the social classes in Niagara Falls. Living close to the Falls myself (on the Canadian side, which gets scarcely a mention, other than for an admission by the author that the Horseshoe Falls provides a better view \u2013 and I agree!), I have a deep interest in this magical location\u2019s allure, history and myth. This novel may not be everyone\u2019s cup of tea, but it certainly is mine!"}, {"userName": "Sharyl", "userReviewDate": "Jun 30, 2009", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/2475858-sharyl", "userReview": "Joyce Carol Oates expertly takes cultural icons and important events and builds novels around them that seem vividly real--as they could very well be.The Falls is actually several stories all wrapped into one novel. First, we meet Ariah Erksine, a newlywed whose husband commits suicide the morning after their wedding night by getting up early, racing to the falls, and plunging in. This is the strange event that gets the novel going. JCO is very good at this; many of her novels begin with events that are very strange and very tragic, but they are always believable when they roll off her pen.The second strange event is that Dirk Burnaby, a lawyer friend of the local entrepreneur who happens to own the hotel at which Ariah is staying, and a rich, highly eligible bachelor, falls in love with Ariah while she keeps her eccentric, week-long vigil by the falls, until rescue crews find her husband's corpse. She becomes known as The Widow Bride of the Falls, and winds up marrying Burnaby a short time later, a man she barely knows. He's persuasive.The two of them have a very passionate relationship and three children, before Dirk Burnaby becomes engrossed in the first Love Canal Case--this is 1962. Here, JCO provides a short history of the Love Canal tragedy that is both succinct and riveting, though she does change the names. I've googled enough to know that the basic facts are correct. This case was never resolved until 1978, and Burnably did not live to see it. On the contrary, his life was ruined because he took this case.The latter part of the book follows his children, their relationship with their strange, damaged mother, and how each of them play a part in discovering a part of their father's past, despite their mother's determined silence. This is a family history that takes place in the wake of the famous Niagara Falls, and I found it quite poignant.I became quite involved with this novel, and liked most of the principal characters. Though long, at 481 pages, it went by rather quickly, and I would gladly recommend it to most people.

Oates is certainly an engaging writer, with a flair for Gothic excess (sex in a graveyard, forsooth). When I saw the story was to be multi-generational, I hoped for a more robust pattern, perhaps along the lines of Wuthering Heights, where the second generation, though repeating some of the happenings of the first generation, has a better outcome. But aside from the said graveyard sex, where the son has a bizarre sexual encounter with a woman who was only suspected of (and did not have) a sexual relationship with the father, I didn't see much of that going on. Instead, the story of the difficult Ariah trifurcates into the stories of her three children, and there is a rather perfunctory-feeling attempt at reunification of both the plots and the family itself at a memorial for the quasi-heroic and misunderstood husband and father.I found the political part of the story - the beginnings of the Love Canal scandal and the rottenness at the heart of the business/political class - laid on *just* thick enough. Any more, and I would have complained that Oates' research was overwhelming the story. On the other hand, the evocation of the Falls themselves, in all their magnificent, romantic and anti-romantic, deadly, mysterious, curiously familiar glory, was wonderful, and I could definitely have lived with more of the same.Anyway, structural complaints aside, I really appreciated the strong imagery and storytelling, and I would most certainly read more by this author (this was my first)."}, {"userName": "Marci", "userReviewDate": "Oct 20, 2009", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/722691-marci", "userReview": "I've read some complaints about this book as being \"over-written\" and \"boring\" with \"hard-to-like characters\" - and while I can see where these folks are coming from - this is part of what I like about JCO. That she creates a complete & believable world with flawed characters, (who sometimes think in cliche, even - another complaint I read). I enjoy all the details, how JCO creates an image I can actually see. Contrary to what someone in another review complained about, I think it was important to follow Ariah on the morning of and week after her first husband's suicide, how everyone treated and thought of her. I would imagine such details during a hugely important happening that shaped a character and her future would matter. While it's sometimes frustrating that nothing comes from certain details (Ariah hiding the note, Royall's encounter with the woman in black), if not meant as a red herring (annoying) it also resembles real life where not everything is resolved or addressed.
