Being a World War II buff and fanatic, I picked up this book to pass the time. The story is epic and the character development is one of the greatest I've ever found in literature. I don't think this book gets enough publicity or credit. It is a historical book with real historical battles from World War II, and it gives a Fictional first-person outlook on the trials of a young boy enrolled in the German Army, or Wehrmacht. Being a Russian boy raised in Germany, he is used as an interrogator in his division for all captured Russian Soldiers. He is then found on the front lines of battle, fighting against Russian Infantry and Artillery. After he is knocked unconscious by a rolling tank, he wakes up behind enemy lines. He must either lay there and die, or embrace the Russian that he used to be.Erik, the main character, is a teenage boy who was brought up by Hitler's Youth. After being enrolled in the Wehrmacht at only age 15, he must learn quickly how to survive in the bloody War. He learns to react quickly in close situations and knows exactly what to do in order to survive across the Russian border. He meets Tamara, a young Russian nurse, and falls in love with her after she takes care of him in a make-shift hospital. They face many trials in this book, running from the War and their own past. I would recommend this book to all ages, as it is very interesting and historical, but would especially recommend it to young adults who are very interested in history. This is a book worth reading over and over."}, {"userName": "Dominic", "userReviewDate": "Feb 02, 2009", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/1982638-dominic", "userReview": "This probably one of my all time favorite books lots of action and packed with history.

READ: Therefore it does not have the normal plot line of a normal novel! The book is set in WWII during the last part of the war. The book takes place in Germany then Russia then Germany again.\tThe main character\u2019s name is Soldier X. He is a soldier drafted into the Nazi army at 15. But this is complicated by the fact that he is half Russian. This means he can speak fluent Russian, making him invaluable as an interpreter. However everything goes wrong when he is trapped behind enemy lines. To give a hint he ends up in a Russian hospital where his Russian is put to the test! Later he meets a Russian girl named Tamara and this creates problems. To find out what happens next you will have to read!\tAlthough \u201cnames, dates, and places were altered wherever necessary,\u201d the story is true and very amazing. Also according to the author\u2019s note this story closely parallels the stories of other Nazis trapped behind enemy lines. These characters I found incredible, almost fictional, which is why the truth behind the story surprised me. One character, Dobelman, had his face so scarred he faked death so he would not have to return home.\tI had trouble relating to the book. The extremes that the characters go through are, well\u2026 extreme to say the least (for example I have never been shot in the face!). But through it all, the characters survive. That is a situation I believe we can all relate to.\tWhether or not I would recommend this book determines on what you are looking for. For someone looking for an amazing WWII story this is for you. However, should you be looking for an entertaining novel with a normal story plot I would not recommend this book. (The action reaches a climax halfway through, then tapers off very slowly as they walk across Euroe I also would not recommend this to a younger child. There are many gruesome scenes, scenes that often end in more than one friend\u2019s death.\tRecommendations aside the book was entertaining. It also pays respect to the absolute destruction to Europe, as well as the sheer number of deaths. (Many of the characters friends die early on; one of his friends even gets his hand shot off! This character later gets killed). So I enjoyed the book but for it\u2019s historical accuracies and it\u2019s story, not necessarily for it\u2019s plotline."}, {"userName": "Michelle", "userReviewDate": "Jul 10, 2011", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/931516-michelle", "userReview": "Read this with my teenage son a few years back. I appreciated the experiences through the eyes of a young German who has been more or less brainwashed by the Nazi propaganda machine (as many Germans were). Sent to the Russian front, he finds himself trapped behind the lines & desperate to survive. Putting on a Russian uniform to blend in, Erik is mistakenly wounded by a fellow German soldier & brought to a Russian field hospital as a \"war hero\" putting him in precarious circumstances as he tries to keep from being discovered as the enemy or a \"spy,\" explain his German accent & his presence on the battlefield, stay alive, & hopefully return to his unit or back home. The unlikely friendship with a Russian Jewish nurse (Tamara)that blossoms into a young romance enhances this story and makes this book appeal not to just teen boys. The action & suspense keeps the reader engaged as well.This is a book that I would HIGHLY recommend for classroom reading at the high school level (perhaps even middle school). It's an easy read & relatively short. More importantly, it can open the discussion among youths regarding the effect of a culture of hatred propigated by a government & the consequences when a people permit a small group of individuals the reigns of power within that government. Despite what one may feel about the Nazis/German soldiers, he/she cannot help but be moved by the struggle of these 2 hapless youths through the killing zone of one of the most horrific events in our human history. One cannot help but be affected by the courage of these two characters - their determination to save each other & to survive their horrendous environment. The battles between the Russians & Germans in this conflict were particularly brutal, but this story of bravery & the unconquerable soul within bears witness to the extraordinary courage & strength that lies within each of us. Also, that people can do great things despite the devastation or the evil that surrounds. That it is based on a true story is even more meaningful."}, {"userName": "Nick", "userReviewDate": "Sep 19, 2013", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/4365813-nick", "userReview": "Soldier X is like All Quiet on the Western Front, written in the style of a video game, with a love story, WWII, and The Russians. A young German boy, whose family is half-Russian, goes off to fight the Russians on the Eastern Front, on a roller-coaster journey into hell. Expertly-paced for reluctant readers more familiar with story-lines from WWII FPS games, Wulffson draws the reader in with engaging, visceral, brutal, and often heavy and thought-provoking prose. The book is divided into three parts: Part 1 features lots of tension-building and action, as well as a mix of FPS and tower-defence style narrative, Part 2 is sort of a behind-the-lines/relationship/character-building interlude, and, just when many reluctant readers will be wondering if they should continue reading, Part 3 returns to tension and action. For what it is, the one main flaw I can find with the book is on page 137 (Tamara's realization). After all that time, the author unbelievably has Tamara completely change her opinion of the main character based on a few swear words, in a tiny, abrupt paragraph. Otherwise, the excitingly raw style is filled with scenes which will make readers of any age question their morality and what they would do in the same situation. Likewise, it will cause them to question their ability to put the book down. Great book, and I suspect a great way to get modern video-game-loving, book-shy kids, especially boys, to read. It is also based on a true story, or stories rather, which goes to show how truth can indeed be stranger and more amazing than fiction.True Rating:4.2 Stars"}, {"userName": "Alex", "userReviewDate": "Oct 27, 2016", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/59020708-alex", "userReview": "The book \u201cSoldier X\u201d was a thrilling non stop book that was based on a true story during World War ll. The book was just constantly having things happen. Like right when you think it\u2019s all calm nope. The book has so many twists and turns and it honestly made me cry. I can\u2019t believe I liked a book about war. But I think I enjoyed it because it wasn't just about survival. It was showing how scary things can get but you just have to keep pushing and pushing no matter what happens. It also shows that if even if the little things didn't happen then it would a completely different. The book also makes you really see people differently.\t\u201cSoldier X\u201d is a book many teachers should be having their students read. Why? Well because the book is about a German soldier who has to stay alive behind enemy lines. I feel like you always read books about the \u201cgood\u201d quote on quote soldiers. But never the \u201cbad\u201d quote on quote soldiers. I mean has anybody really just sat down and thought \u201cMan I wonder what it was like to be German soldier?\u201d Like just telling someone you were a Nazi and or German soldier probably made people not like you or possibly even lose trust in you. But it\u2019s not your fault you are German and terrified or Hitler.

Brainwashed under Nazi rule, 16 year old Erik Brandt has no choice but to follow the commands of his superiors. Erik is able to escape the battle by changing into the uniform of a nearby dead Russian. However, during his escape he is shot by a fallen German soldier. He is then taken to a Russian hospital where he becomes acquainted with his nurse, Tamara, and other Russian soldiers. In order to avoid conflict, he covers his background by claiming amnesia. Eventually they are forced to evacuate the hospital due to invading German forces. Erik and Tamara travel together as they survive opposing conflicts with allied soldiers. Although their loyalty originated with opposing nationalities, Erik and Tamara eventually fall in love, and survive the war. At first I was interested in the story because of the whole concept of WWII and Nazi rule. But the reason why I loved the book so much was because I became so fascinated by the journey of the young boy. The adventure of the story is what kept me reading.  I would recommend this book to anyone who is fascinated by the WWII era and enjoys following the journey of main character.

The novel follows the life of a teenage boy named Erik Brandt who fought for the German army in World War II. As the story continues Erik makes new friends, meets the love of his life, and keeps a secret that is life or death if anyone finds out. Some insights that the book enlightened me to is the quality of life that the solders had to live in. They had to dig bunkers into the side of hills as living quarters. They also had to ride in a train for hours, then walk out to the front lines only to have to fight along side your best friend and watch their head get blown of right beside you. The novel also created a personal vision of a war hospital, all the injuries that somebody would see in there. One thing that I really like about this book was that I physically could not put it down, I started reading it one day and by the next afternoon I had finished the entire book. Another thing that I liked about this book is that it humanized the big old mean general by making him hate the elements of war just as much as the teenagers. The last thing that I really liked about this novel is that it told the story of World War II from a German's perspective. That is something you don't see very often. I would recommend this novel for anyone who is interested or is learning about World War II because it tells the story of the war really well."}, {"userName": "Sam Seiken", "userReviewDate": "Jan 12, 2012", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/6300405-sam-seiken", "userReview": "the book solder x is about a and young Nazi soldier during World War II.

Their family\u2019s 1st language was Russian and the 2nd was German.

There he experienced the horrors of war in his 1st combat which was more or less a suicide mission. In that day he got shot and while he was laying in a trench full of his dead friends, a tank rolled right over the trench and broke down in that convenient location. While he was there he switched his uniform with a dead Russian boys one. A day later he woke up in a Russian field hospital lying in a stretcher. at the hospital he has to Hide his real identity and pretend to be somebody else.

This 2001 title combines many good elements that make this a great read for your WWII obsessed boys.Erik is only 16 when he is conscripted into the German army. He's not thrilled, because his grandparents are Russian. He gets sent to the front, and there is some rather graphic fighting. The sad conditions of war are all described-- the filth, the cold and damp, the battles that cause young boys to lose their lives. During one of these battles, Erik is badly injured and trapped under a tank with a dead Russian soldier-- he changes uniforms with him and emerges, pretending to be Russian but have amnesia. He ends up working in the hospital where he is treated, and escaping with one of the nurses when the fighting stops.This was really fabulous for the idea that people are people, regardless of their country. At one point, Erik kills a German soldier who has opened fire on him in order to save his Russian companions. Things are not black and white during a war.

He knew if he was caught by anyone he would be killed. He starts on the Germans but then in a desperate act to survive he flips his uniform with a Russian soldier.

I loved how realistic the book was and I could actually picture the scenarios in my head. It was written in a fifteen year-old boy's point of view, so it was interesting to read a book that was based on the experiences that these young men had to go through. To me, something like that seems unreasonable, but, it actually could be something that would possibly happen if our country was in some sort of crisis. The book was so detailed that, at times, I could actually see myself in these scenarios. Since it was very detailed, there was a few parts with gory war details, but it wasn't too bad. One of the things I liked most about this book was that, it wasn't completely downhill after Erik got injured. He was actually able to improve things towards the end, and I think he really was happy with where he ended up at in the end of the book.

A young German soldier who is half Russian is chosen to fight for the Nazis in a great theme plot of friendship, love, and sorrow. This book shows in a great way the life of young German soldiers. The plot is very credible because it was based on a true story about a man who now lives in Oregon. In addition, the authentic setting of Nazi Germany and even on the front lines of battle, really adds to the depth of the book. There are many themes in this book as well including love, hardships, and fear. Another great attribute to this book is the way it shows how the Nazis lived during war. It shows in a very powerful way how hard life was and how the soldiers could do things so horrible to so many people. Solder X also portrays great realism with language and cultural influence.

One of the conflicts that this character faced was based around his personal beliefs around war. Erik didn\u2019t like war, and he didn\u2019t like killing people.

I feel that once you get to know the character throughout the book, you begin to relate with them, and feel the emotions that they are feeling \u2013 something that a textbook would never be able to do. Something that I realized while reading this book is that some of the boys that were fighting for Germany had no clue what concentration camps did. In one of the first chapters of the book, they got off of a train an headed into a concentration camp where they were served dinner. The people that were serving them food were all emaciated, and on the verge of death. Most of the boys thought that these people were in the worst condition because they were criminals, but Erik and his small group of fast friends quickly realized that it was not the Jews stuck inside the camp that were criminals; the Germans were. A truth about life that really grabbed me in this book was how brutal war really was. I\u2019ve watched movies like Saving Private Ryan, and everyone cared about their platoon. While reading this, I realized that this is extremely untrue. A lot of the boys had the mindset of, \u201cBetter him than me\u201d. The real eye opener was when the officers were making jokes about the boys who were dead, and saying, \u201cAll the men have died, so now they\u2019re sending us boys.\u201d. I know that if I was in Erik\u2019s position, I would have no confidence left in myself after hearing jokes about death, especially from someone who was supposed to be a leader to me. I REALLY enjoyed this book. This book is easily the best book I\u2019ve had to read for a school project, and I highly recommend it. Because this book was written from the point of view of a 15-year-old, I was able to relate to a lot of the issues he experienced in the book. The war was not the only conflict that was in this book. Erik went through the grief of losing someone close to him, struggled through relationship issues, and he also had to help his friend, Tamara, through the grief of her losing someone she saw as a parental figure. This book was very real, and provided, (what I would imagine to be), a very realistic idea of what it was like to be a German or Russian in the war. Another thing that I liked about this book, as silly as it sounds, is that there was a happy ending. I thought this was a good ending because towards the end of the book, a slew of negative things happened, and this was a good way to end on a good note. Overall, if I was to give this a rating out of 5, I\u2019d give it 5 stars. I found this book to be a very easy read, very interesting, but also very scary and sad. This book is a look into what all the boys and men went through in WWII. Some didn\u2019t know what they were fighting for, and some believed they were fighting for the wrong side. The only thing that I didn\u2019t like about this book is that it was based upon multiple different true stories, and it makes me upset that people actually had to endure things discussed in this book."}, {"userName": "Karter", "userReviewDate": "Oct 01, 2017", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/13336815-karter", "userReview": "Soldier X. the self-titled book written by Don L. Wulffson is told in a first-person limited point of view from the eyes of a 15-year-old German-born (half Russian) boy who speaks fluent Russian. This boy's name is Erik Brandt living in Nazi Germany With his parents and his Russian Grandparents. He lives a normal life until he is conscripted into the Wehrmacht with very little training he is quickly rushed out and deployed to the Eastern Front. This where the book starts. With Erik on a train on his way to being deployed with his platoon. And this is where one of the insights a textbook just can't give you appears. Erik learns the names of all his squad mates but most of them are killed before Erik can develop a deep connection. I believe Don L. Wulffson purposely introduces these minor characters as a way to let the reader know that these young boys and men were often used as just tools of war that higher-ups see as disposable. and that is a viewpoint that will be hard to find in any textbook. Continuing with the story of the book Erik finds himself mortally wounded after his trench is attacked by a Russian offensive. After managing to crawl under a tank he realizes he is far behind enemy lines so he dresses in the uniform of a dead Russian solder about his age. He later slips into a group of Russian soldiers who realize he needs imminent medical attention he later wakes up in a Russian controlled Hospital and tries his best to blend in and befriend the other injured Russians in the makeshift hospital. He does this with ease and not because he speaks fluent Russian but because he genuinely enjoys the company of these other wounded soldiers. This where I believe the author left a life lesson/Peral of wisdom which was conveniently \"Never judge a book by its cover\" this amplified the most when Erik meets a nurse named Tamara who Erik eventually develops strong feelings for. Another example is when Erik is engaged in battle with a group of Russians charging his trench he sees a young Russian boy that couldn't be any older than he gets shot and a plea for mercy in Russian. At this point, he has a moment of realization that that boy and we are no different and he has no reason to hate him besides the fact he's being told to. To bring this review to a conclusion I will summarise what I like and dislike most about the book. I feel like the ending although well thought out and realistic it seems too much like a Hollywood type movie ending where the main character (while still suffering life-changing injuries) Gets the girl and lives all the way through seemingly only because he's the main character. so with all the praise, this book gets from me and the one gripe I have with it. It still earns 4/5 stars for me while the ending may seem slightly flawed I still believe the story its self is a very memorable and realistic one that I have yet to see be beaten by any other historical fiction book. Overall I do recommend this book to anyone interested in a good read of this topic."}, {"userName": "Wyatt C", "userReviewDate": "Oct 17, 2017", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/70997507-wyatt-c", "userReview": "The plot is a 16-year boy drafted into the Germany army in world war two. He is sent to the soviet union to fight for Germany. His base gets overrun by the Soviets. He can speak Russian. So he changes clothes to a Russian soldier that is dead.The main charter is Soldier X. He doesn't really change that much. In the beginning, he is terrified of what is going to happen. In the middle, he has to go to the front lines and that is when the stuff gets real. The end he changes to a husband and then he happy till he dies.I loved this book. It flowed well and did everything right. It had a slight romance but not enough to make it gross. And its plenty of realistic details. It keeps me on the edge at the end because I thought he died."}], "description": "Sixteen-year-old Erik Brandt barely knows what Germany is fighting for when he is drafted into Hitler's army in 1944.
