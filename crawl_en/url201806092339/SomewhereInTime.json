After leaving my kindle at work over a long weekend, I pulled the trigger on it.Firstly, the first 33% of this book was an uphill climb. Wearing snow shoes. With a safe strapped to my back. Richard Collier finds out he has a brain tumor and decides to go for one last road trip. He stays at a hotel, becomes infatuated with an actress from 1896, and travels back to the 1890's with self hypnosis. It takes over 100 pages for him to get there. Also, time travel via self hypnosis?I had good intentions but life's too short to push through something I'm barely interested in, even if the author is responsible for most of the great Twilight Zone episodes. I may return to it at some future date."}, {"userName": "Algernon", "userReviewDate": "Aug 14, 2014", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/4728718-algernon", "userReview": "A beautiful romance from the pen of a writer more famous for his horror thrillers. How far are you willing to go for the woman you love? Richard Collier has never met the woman of his dreams. And now, at thirty-six, it might be to late, as he is diagnosed with an unoperable brain tumor. As a screenwriter he should know better than most how dreams are created out of thin air, yet in his vulnerable state of mind he is not immune to flights of fancy. While staying overnight at a luxury hotel near San Diego, he finds himself falling under the spell of an old photograph found in a dusty basement: he decides this is the woman he has been waiting for all his life. The only problem: the photograph is 80 years old, dating back to 1896, and the actress in the image has probably beed dead a long time ago.  No, it's more than beauty. It's the expression on her face that haunts and conquers me. That gentle, honest, sweet expression. I wish I could have met her. The image of the beautiful actress from last century becomes such an obsession for Richard, that he is constantly thinking about her, asleep or awake, as in a trance. He reads every available book about her life, about the period when she stayed in the same Coronado hotel near San Diego, about the history of the hotel and about the roles in the hteathre that made her famous. Richard discovers that Elise McKenna was as famous in her time as Ingrid Bergman or Audrey Hepburn would be decades later. And, like a true diva, she kept her private life a mystery, carefully protecting her intimacy from the prying eyes of the press.Almost half of the novel explores the total immersion of Richard into the life of Elise McKenna. He surrounds himself with her photographs, with her theatrical reviews, with the meagre tidbits available about her personal life. It appears a major change of heart in her career occured in the very same hotel, during a late autumn performance of a piece by J M Barrie. Richard somehow convinces himself that in order to discover her secret it is enough to desire it with all his being, mind and body. If only he could convince himself it is possible to travel back in time, he would meet and talk to his idol in the flesh. That is all he wants from life right now. So he engages in an intensive regimen of hypnotic self-instruction, telling himself over and over and over again: It's Thursday afternoon. You're lying on the bed in your room at the Hotel del Coronado and it's Thursday afternoon, November 19, 1896. Your mind accepts this absolutely. There is no question in your mind. It is November 19, 1896, Thursday November 19, 1896. You're Richard Collier. Thirty-six. Lying on your hotel bed, eyes closed, on Thursday afternoon, November 19, 1896. 1896, 1896, Room 527. Hotel del Coronado. Thursday afternoon, November 19, 1896. Many writers have tried their hand at time-travel stories, inventing sophisticated machines or alternate dimension in the time-space continuum. Why not accept for once that love is strong enough to take you to the place your heart desires? The whole world might only be an illusion and we only live inside our heads anyway. So give Richard the benefit of the doubt, and let him wake up from his hypnosis in 1896, in a room of the Hotel del Coronado. I'm pulled in two directions simultaneously - toward yearning and toward reason. It's at times like these I hate the brain. It always builds more barriers than it can topple. In the second part of the novel, Richard gets to meet Elise, and because this is a romantic story, she seems to have been waiting just for him, all her life. The concept sounds so corny and cheap when I put it down on paper, like a typical obsessed weirdo stalking an innocent woman, but from the pen of Matheson, it is a thing of beauty, charged with passion and melancholy. With an elegant economy of means, he captures the beauty of the Belle Epoque building ( \"Last of the extravagantly conceived seaside hotels\" ), the different social conventions and atitudes of the turn of the century, and most of all the difficulties even beautiful and succesful women had to face in a male dominated society. Elise is very much alone, self-reliant but wary of men's attentions, bullied by her impressario and discredited in the eyes of the public simply by being an actress. when she finally starts to express her inner feelings, we discover that people in 1896 were as passioante and in need of affection as today or 500 years ago. In only a couple of letters, Elise captured my imagination just as easily as her picture enchanted Richard Collier: \"And life, most sweet, as heart to heart, speaks kindly when we meet and part.\" The story stops much too soon for me, a bittersweet moment that is probably meant to encourage us to be true to our feelings and to live fully in the present, because it passes in the blink of an eye. What we learn from 1896 is that people seemed more alive then because they cared more about the world around them, and the greatest crime that Richard noticed in his 1970's contemporaries is an apathy and a waste of such precious moments: There is something compelling about human beings believing deeply. I do not intend to discuss, at length, that time I left. I will only say say that there is memory of indifferent atitudes toward many things, among them life itself. When asked in an interview about his favorite creation, Matheson nominated  Bid Time Return  , rechristened Somewhere in Time for the big screen translation that he also scripted (\"\"Somewhere in Time is the story of a love which transcends time, What Dreams May Come is the story of a love which transcends death.... I feel that they represent the best writing I have done in the novel form.\") . He probably put more of himself into the story than in his more commercial thrillers, including a love of music illustrated by references to Lehar, Strauss, and especially Mahler ( 'Has there ever been a more heartbreaking farewell to life expressed in music?'. Even more fascinating is the story of the novel's inception: Elise McKenna is based on a real character from 1896. [source: wikipedia]Maude Adams was a beautiful actress whose picture Matheson saw in a hotel lobby. Matheson began to read about her career, and his imagination soon transformed this encounter into a novel. I enjoyed reading more on the internet about Miss Adams and about the real Hotel del Coronado, a place that attracted celebrities like flies, and was familair to me from Billy Wilder's \"Some Like it Hot\" movie. The line between fiction and real life becomes in this way slightly blurred and more convincing, for all the impossiblity of time travel that my brain insists on raising up.I would like now to watch again the movie with Christopher Reeve and Jane Seymour, as the only way to spend a little more time with this magical romance."}, {"userName": "Carol", "userReviewDate": "Sep 25, 2014", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/7668522-carol", "userReview": "[but ultimately sad (hide spoiler)]"}, {"userName": "Michael", "userReviewDate": "Jul 08, 2008", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/1177534-michael", "userReview": "Part fantasy novel, part romance novel, Richard Matheson's \"Bid Time Return\" finds dying writer Richard Collier falling in love with a photograph of a turn of the century actress Elise McKenna, becoming obsessed with her and then finding a way to travel back in time to meet her.On the surface, the premise sounds absurd, but really no more so than your standard romance novel. It's the story of two people falling in love and overcoming obstancles to be together. In this case, it's the gulf of time standing between them. At least that's the case at first.Once you accept the premise that Collier can and does find a way to move back in time to meet McKenna (he's staying at the same hotel she is, so he doesn't move in space, only time), the rest of the story falls well into place. Matheson's narration of the Collier via first-person, starting off in short, punctuated bursts from Collier's audio diary and later becoming longer and more detailed as Collier switches to writing out his feelings and confiding more in the readers, helps draw the reader in and question if this is really happening or if Collier has descending into dementia due to a brain tumor. Thankfully, Matheson wisely decides to not confirm or deny the reality of events, allowing the reader to choose for themselves.Instead, what drives the story is Matheson's ability to put ordinary people in extraordinary circumstances and realistically portray the character's reactions. The premise may be one of fantasy, but the characters are realistic. It's easy to see why Stephen King says Matheson was a big influence on his (King's) works. Time travel in a romance story is apparently nothing new. But Matheson's strengh is finding a new twist on the old story, bringing in just enough of his own distinctive storytelling style to make it his own. This is a book that will have you rooting for Collier in his quest and heartbroken at the end when it ends in tragedy (as it must, since the ending is set before the story begins.) But it's not the ending that matters so much as the journey. And in the hands of Matheson, this is a journey worth taking."}, {"userName": "Joe Valdez", "userReviewDate": "Jun 08, 2014", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/26876584-joe-valdez", "userReview": "Somewhere in Richard Matheson's 1975 novel Bid Time Return is a wonderful science fiction tale dying to get out. Some would argue it did, inspiring the much loved 1980 film Somewhere In Time, which was so embraced that it became the de facto title for the novel when reprinted. This is the romantic fantasy of an author born in the 1920s and in addition to being difficult for me to relate to on that end, excited me only in the moments its hero travels through time.Unfolding in the format of a found journal, Bid Time Return begins November 14, 1971 with thirty-six year old screenwriter Richard Collier leaving the Los Angeles home of his brother Robert. With the flip of a coin, he drives south. Richard has learned he has six months to live as a result of a temporal-lobe tumor and with no children, no great love of his own, takes to the road, stopping in Long Beach to tour the Queen Mary before settling at the grand Coronado Hotel in San Diego.It is here that Richard comes across the portrait of Elise McKenna, star of the turn-of-the-century stage who was at the hotel on November 18, 1896 to perform in a play written for her by J.M. Barrie. Richard becomes obsessed with the actress, learning what little he can about her life from books. He determines that he actually saw her once, while a twenty-year-old boy in college, and begins to piece together clues that they may have actually met sometime long ago.Employing hypnosis techniques (which actually work much better on the page than they have any right to), Richard is able to reconstitute in 1896 on the eve of Miss McKenna's performance at the Coronado. He's rented a period costume for the occasion, brought along a twenty-dollar gold certificate and a ten-dollar silver certificate of the time for mad money and armed with the confidence that history has meant for them to be together, opens his eyes in the turn of the century.Perhaps the biggest problem with reading Bid Time Return today is how Matheson's prescription for eternal love comes across a lot like stalking. Richard is not only obsessed with Elise and adamant about being with her, but possessing her as an object. Her beauty and allure is what attracts him, nothing more. It's not a leap to imagine the stalker who confronted Sandra Bullock outside her bedroom in 2014 shares a lot of the same qualities as Matheson's lovesick hero.Matheson employs some neat slight of hand to explain why Elise wouldn't turn and run away from Richard at the first sight of him. He filled the story with just enough detail about the Coronado Hotel and time travel to tease my curiosity, but falters by not giving Richard anyone in the story to confide in, to truly examine what it would be like for a man from 1971 to be living in 1896. Richard could have just as easily arrived on a movie set.Richard Matheson's contributions to The Twilight Zone and to science fiction in general are impossible to ignore, but it seems that some of his best known novels are better suited to a 24-minute TV format. Bid Time Return is quite thin, perhaps born of a time when science fiction and fantasy was meant to be consumed in magazine format, long before Stephen King was devoting 150,000 words and more to his dark fantasy novels. What disappointed me about Bid Time Return is how little Richard and Elise have in common once they cross the sea of time to be together. Their laughter is fleeting, their cultures completely disparate and their apologies for clinging on to each other so ferociously never seem to end. This couple has no reason to be together other than the author's insistence that they're meant to be together. Matheson was apparently inspired by a portrait he came across at Piper's Opera House in Virginia City, Nevada of the 19th century stage actress Maude Adams (she is quite beautiful). Matheson was struck by the fact that Adams never married and as if seeing an opening, inserts himself into the shoes of a time traveler who covets her. For some readers, this is true love. For me, it was creepy. I needed a reason for Richard to travel through time and pursue Elise rather than to possess her.The author's imagination is never in doubt when it comes to time travel. Like my favorite stories in this sub-genre, no time machine was employed, no tech, simply the human mind, and it works quite well. The romantic component, on the other hand, was repellent. I wished the story was devoted to the time period and to the nature of a traveler from the future who finds himself trapped there. Elise McKenna should've been left alone. Richard can't help but expose himself as a world class creeper."}, {"userName": "Buggy", "userReviewDate": "Dec 28, 2011", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/3099666-buggy", "userReview": "Opening Line: \"Driving down Long Valley Road. Lovely day; bright sunshine, blue sky.\"This week has been one filled with romantic tragedies for me. First I went to the see the re-release of Titanic in 3D (oh Jack) and then because I hadn\u2019t had quite enough heartache I decided to revisit one of my all time favourite romances with Somewhere In Time (Bid Time Return.) It\u2019s been years since I first read this as a teenager, -god knows how many times I watched the movie starring Jane Seymour and Christopher Reeve (another tragedy there) and I wasn\u2019t sure if I\u2019d feel the same about it now. Really the only difference this time around was that I was able to appreciate the quality of the writing and amount of research that must have gone into making this tale of time travel, well, believable. The romance is still as moving as it was. And yes much like Titanic even though I knew what was coming I still shed a tear at the end.Told from a first person narrative and written as if you were reading a journal, we meet Richard Collier. A 30ish Los Angeles screenwriter with an inoperable brain tumour. Not wanting to burden his family, Richard packs up his life and decides to end his days wherever the road takes him. These beginning chapters are fast moving, choppy and written with short slightly erratic paragraphs as Richard dictates into an audio diary. In the second half the journal entries become longer and more detailed and quite honestly a little dry in places. Through the fate of a coin toss Richard finds himself at the Hotel Del Coronado, a grand seaside resort, steeped in history that manages to become a character onto itself here. It\u2019s within the hotel museum that Richard comes across a turn of the century photograph of an actress named Elise McKenna, and at that moment everything else in Richard\u2019s life ceases to exist. He can\u2019t stop thinking about the beautiful woman, or the look in her eyes, becoming obsessed with her and the time she lived in. Richard then begins to research her life and in every instance notes a complete change in her character after her acting troupe left the hotel 75 years before. If only he could meet her, if only he could get to her and find out what made her so sad, why she never married. Its then that Richard begins researching time travel and self hypnosis, convinced that he can get back to her. When he finds his name in an 1896 hotel registry he knows with certainty what the change in Elise was. He was with her, now he just has to get back to her. Some of the time travel paradoxes in this are positively mind bending and you can\u2019t think about them too long for fear of brain explosions.As I mentioned the writing changes as soon as Richard finds himself in 1896 (yeah he does) becoming more formal and detailed. It is explained that he is now writing his accounts instead of dictating. Matheson\u2019s descriptions of the time are pure genius, not just taking into account the obvious like clothing but the social attitudes, the language differences, the size of people. Is everyone short and stocky? I loved the descriptions and Richards discovery of it all. The romance aspect here is beautifully done albeit a little soppy and with a hint of the supernatural, because as it turns out Elise was expecting him. Well not him but through a physic she\u2019s been waiting for someone mysterious to sweep her off her feet. Her over protective manager plays the antagonist here, trying in vain to keep them apart and while Richard should hate him he finds that he cannot because he knows how the man dies. I suppose you can\u2019t change the past though and as much as I found myself cheering for our couple it was already written. Probably the most moving part of this book is in the afterward (provided by Richard\u2019s brother) which explains that his time travel was only that of a form of escapism provided by his tumour amassed brain. Robert Collier cannot however explain the love letters in Richards pocket or the antique (yet new) pocket watch or Elise McKenna\u2019s famous dying last words. He leaves it up to the reader to decide if it happened or not. I think it did.

Like, stalker with a crush obsessed. The woman is Elise McKenna, an actress who staged a play in the hotel he's staying at in 1896, so of course his obsession becomes sufficiently powerful to let him hypnotize himself into time traveling to her, and that's where things get really cringeworthy.Apparently, his tactic for wooing her is \"cling to her knees and whine until she relents. And she does, because, literally, magic! \"I don't know why I'm putting up with this obviously creepy stalker who won't leave me alone, but I am magically in love with him.\" Holy hell. Also, this woman who is an early Feminist and Suffragette and built up a ton of armoured walls - she says so, literally - just drapes herself all over this man who showed up out of nowhere, and melts. Wow. All this is buried in heaps and piles of the sappiest dialogue I've read in a while, and spattered with pointless scenes that are intended to make it look like plot is happening.Girls, if a random creepy guy shows up and tells you he's destined for you after failing in love with your photograph, do the right thing and kick him out the nearest airlock."}, {"userName": "Kandice", "userReviewDate": "Dec 10, 2009", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/1396160-kandice", "userReview": "I want to explain my rating. The first 1/3 of the book was worthy of 5 stars for me. The second 2/3, only worth 3 stars, but I can't justify an over all rating of 3. In addition to a foreword from the \"author's\" brother, there is an afterword that bumps up the quality of the story from those 3 stars. As a teen, I must have seen this movie a hundred times, so I went into the book looking for those same feelings of love, romance, nostalgia and melancholy. They were all present, but the movie had an innocence I found lacking on the written page. I haven't seen the movie in years, so a re-watch may be in order.This is the story of R.C. Collier, told in a narrative as if it were his journal. Collier has an inoperable, so terminal, brain tumor. He escapes his life to end his days traveling and journaling alone. Along the way he stumbles upon the Hotel Del Coronado, and falls in love, not only with a woman he sees pictured in the hotel's museum, but, the hotel and time she lived in, as well. He then does exhaustive research into her life, the hotel's history and the period in which she lived. The woman, a famous stage star of the late 1800's, early 1900's, is Elise McKenna.My favorite part of the book, which was very brief in the movie, was his research and attempts to visit the past. It was hard! He had nothing to lose, so kept at it, and I found his dedication to a seemingly, impossible task sweet. All for the sake of a face. I don't want to spoil anything for that 2% of readers who have not seen the movie, but the entire premise is based on an ontological paradox. One could go dizzy trying to analyze the ramifications of Collier's actions. Suffice it to say, against all odds, Collier succeeds. Once he reaches 1896 and Elise, it gets pretty sappy. Lines I found charming from Christopher Reeves, came across as almost ridiculously mooney on the page. He does find his love, becomes her love, and...tragically is sent back to 1971. In a nutshell.The afterword, written by Collier's brother, explains that the journal outlining his \"adventure\" is the escape mechanism of a dying mind. Genius, as far as I'm concerned, for Matheson to give us the option of believing or not. Is there really such a thing as love that can triumph over time? He gives us the privilege of deciding for ourselves. Either way, it's a great, heart-tugging tale."}, {"userName": "Heather", "userReviewDate": "Jul 27, 2008", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/1341284-heather", "userReview": "All I can say is, it is completely obvious that this book was written by a man. He spends a tedious amount of time trying to explain away his time travel premise and forgets to explain the most obvious part of his book: how could a supposedly intelligent woman fall in love with his wacko main character?Saw the movie years ago and thought it would be fun to read the book, since they are USUALLY better. What I found was a super sugary story that wasn't very moving.Richard Collier is the main character, dying of a brain tumor. He runs off to a historical hotel near San Diego and proceeds to fall in love with an actress from the 1890s purely by looking at her photo. He then proceeds to learn all about her (and oh yeah, how to time travel) by ducking into the local book store. Of course in a matter of days he's figured out how to go back in time, come across famous actress Elise McKenna and make her fall ardently in love with him in a matter of hours.Instead of a smart and dashing hero, Richard comes off as a crazy fan/stalker that tells Elise he loves her but of course refuses to tell her anything about himself. It seems incredible to me that the reader is to believe that Elise would just go for this guy (who knows a creepy amount about her without being told and is only vague about himself) with no questions asked.I also found the beginning of the book, which is written as if it is a transcript of Richard speaking into his handy-dandy hand recorder extremely distracting. An image of this lone dude whispering into his recorder while mooning over vintage photographs does little to dispess his psycho image.It gets easier to read as the book goes on and gets into a better flow of dialog, but it is still a very fluffy storyline.I read this book while lounging poolside, and that is probably why I read it all the way through. It is good vacation reading, because ultimately you're not going to care if it gets wet and soggy from the pool.

This proves that romance novels aren't supposed to be made for quick mass consumption, written solely by insecure, money-hungry chicks (or dudes, or chicks that are dudes and vice versa), nor portray equally shallow themes that go on for volumes as long as they keep selling. It takes some balls to be able to appropriately write romance. The sort of balls which isn't an exclusive previledge of men. I'm standing on nothing. Like a character from a movie cartoon who runs off a cliff yet keeps on moving in midair a while before he notices. I've noticed.  Now begins the fall.Matheson tells us the story of Richard, a guy suffering from a terminal illness who falls in love with Elise, an actress who lived almost a century before his time. So he decides to travel back in time in order to be with her. It's an undeniable fact that Matheson was a maniac with details. He doesn't just have his hero travel through time. He goes through many details as to how he achieves such thing. The same goes about pretty much everything in this novel. Every small step, he takes with extreme difficulty and is well-deserved. That said, it never lacks the ability to convey to the reader the magnitude of Richard's feelings for Elise. In fact, Matheson writes in a way that makes you feel as though you're reading something personal. Something that actually happened. Thus, you actually get into the hero's shoes and never step out of them until the very last page.\"Tell me all about yourself,\" she said. \"Whatever you can, I mean. I want to love everything you love.\"  \"Love yourself then,\" I told her. \"Somewhere in Time\" is not as cheesy as it may look. It's not a happy love story. It's a deep, psychological drama. It makes you go through all kinds of emotions before you eventually reach to the end and find yourself clinging to the one side of the coin, deliberately ignoring the other. It speaks to your very need of believing in the extraordinary romance and, typical as it may sound, love that transcends time.

A story about a man transporting himself backwards through time by love's inspiration is pretty great, and the way in which it's delivered is clever.

I was constantly distracted by the seemingly foolish, brash, unthinking, short-sighted, ignorant decisions or conversations the main character made.It seems like someone who can master himself, his mind, and time itself would be a bit cooler, calmer and more thoughtful.Furthermore - while this is perhaps more a commentary that Matheson intended about \"love\" and \"true love\", I couldn't help but find that once the lovers DO meet and DO fall in love, it's terribly shallow. With hardly any conversation, they fall madly in love, never exchanging more than names and a walk on the beach. Call me cold-hearted, but that's not love. I would've liked more substance to each character and their relationship.Overall, I was just disappointed, the book did not read easily and I was not compelled by the main character's monologue.

Many people know of this book because of the movie with this same title. The book was originally published under \"Bid Time Return\", which I like much more. Richard Collier falls in love with a photo of an actress from 1896, his year being 1971. He attempts time travel back, she falls in love with him, and then they live happily ever afer in 1896? That would only be too easy.Richard Matheson is that type of author who grips me with such force that I can't find what's real and what's fiction. Through the course of the book, I actually believed that it is possible to time travel the way the character did in this book - almost tried it one night; I'll spare you the details of the attempt.(***Possible Spoilers Below***) I have read through a lot of the reviews on \"Somewhere in Time\" and I'm having a hard time understanding many responses. Some broke down the book in sections, saying the first part was bad and the ending was good; vice versa. One actually said the writing was horrible. To say the least, I am flabbergasted by these remarks. Everyone is entitled to their opinions, of course, but for one to say this was bad writing; I just don't know how to approach this. Anyhow, I haven't seen the movie - on regards to many people's opinions on the movie was much better than the book - I can only assume that this movie is the best movie ever made.

The book gives the reader a better understanding of Elise, what her beliefs and how much she had to struggle with herself and her feelings about Richard.

You can understand the protagonist's thoughts and actions, even when they are clearly making a mistake (this excellent first person perspective was also present in _I Am Legend_). This is mostly a love story involving some time travel, but I have to say I liked it better than _The Time Traveler's Wife_. A large part of this is because I understood the main character himself, and have had many of the same emotions regarding longing for my true love, being excited just to remain in her presence, and not being able to stand the time when we are apart.

(The movie is filmed at the Grand.)However, I remember the music references very well. I remember being disappointed when the movie music was Rachmaninoff -- yes, I understand it's lush and romantic, but not what's in the book. In the book our time-traveler had read a short bio on his past obsession that said one of her favorite composers was Mahler, but when he finally travels back in time to meet her, she's never heard any Mahler. So he introduces her, and their pivotal work of his is the 9th Symphony. If you've never heard this, the last movement is heartbreakingly beautiful, and slow, and slowly gets quieter, until it finally dies away.

While staying at the historic Hotel del Coronado in San Diego, he happens upon the captivating portrait of a young actress from 1896, Elise McKenna, taken from back when she performed an original play at the hotel. As he becomes increasingly obsessed with Elise, Richard reaches the realization that he cannot allow his life to end without being with her. But what is a man to do, though, when more than seven decades separate him from the woman of his dreams? The answer: travel back in time, of course.Published in 1975 and originally called Bid Time Return, a notable line from Richard II\u2014yeah, Shakespeare\u2019s plays have certainly provided the inspiration for a great many titles\u2014the book\u2019s title was later amended to Somewhere in Time only after being adapted to film in 1980. As a keen reader of Matheson\u2019s bibliography, this story is far removed from his usual tales of horror and suspense, though like the rest of his works it is written with the same effortless and lucid writing style.Having read only a handful of romance stories, I realize my thoughts may not be indicative of the prevailing view. That being said, the yearning that Robert and Elise have for one another struck me as offbeat and improbable, especially when considering both the nature of how they met and the fact that the length of their relationship spanned only a day and a half. If anything, time travel itself seems more plausible. Moreover, the character of Richard Collier is grossly flawed not only in how he becomes overly infatuated with someone after only seeing her in a faded, turn-of-the-century photograph but also the manner in which he steamrolls his way into Elise\u2019s life, barely allowing her a moment to herself, putting his ego before her career and peace of mind. At times it seems as though Matheson is making a statement about the perils of obsession, as evident in the scene wherein Collier becomes oddly fixated with Elise's feet while she's performing onstage. To be fair, though, anyone who\u2019s ever been consumed by unrequited love will have little trouble identifying with the character. There's a bittersweet melancholy that permeates the pages of this novel, as these characters are made to carry on a life apart, each a shadow on the consciousness of the other. Readers can only hope that these two will find in the hereafter what they were denied in this life.An endearing enough romance that features an innovative approach to the mechanics of time travel, Somewhere in Time is flawed but readable. The dialogue is tolerable, though some of the gushy exclamations of love near the literal and figurative climax are rather pitiful and trite. Any readers enchanted by the delicate interplay of love and time would be better suited to pick up a copy of Audrey Niffenegger\u2019s The Time-Traveler\u2019s Wife, an inventive debut that is vastly superior in poignancy, character depth, and execution."}, {"userName": "Christopher", "userReviewDate": "Jul 12, 2015", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/8076015-christopher", "userReview": "This is only the second work by Richard Matheson I have read; the first was the perfect little gem of a novella \"I Am Legend.\" \"Somewhere in Time\" (originally entitled \"Bid Time Return\") is not as fine as the previous work, but it's an interesting attempt to write a love story combined with a time-travel sci-fi escapade. Adapted into the 1980 film \"Somewhere in Time\" (the novel's title was later changed as a tie-in to the movie) by Jeannot Szwarc, starring Christopher Reeve and Jane Seymour - a movie that did poorly when released but which has since developed a cult following - the book has both the strengths and weaknesses of its adaptation.Los Angeles. 1971. Ricard Collier is a 36-year-old television writer who has just been diagnosed with an inoperable brain tumor. He has 6 months to live. In despair, he leaves the city behind, planning to head somewhere to the east - to the mountains - where he can spend his final days. Along the way, he gets sidetracked and checks in to the famous Coronado Hotel (where Billy Wilder's 1959 \"Some Like It Hot\" was filmed) in San Diego. Once there, he comes across a photo of Elise McKenna, an early 20th-century actress who once stayed at the hotel. Entranced, he becomes obsessed with knowing everything about her. The more he learns, the more he decides that he must travel back in time to meet her. In fact, he may already have done so, and this may all be part of time-loop continuum. I saw the film in the 1990s, and enjoyed watching Reeve and Seymour (both so effortlessly beautiful and charismatic on screen) fall in love. The explanation of the actual time travel was weak, and very derivative of Jack Finney's brilliant novel \"Time and Again,\" published in 1970 (five years before Matheson published this book), but I suspended my disbelief and just sat back and enjoyed the romance. As the film progressed, I found myself swept up in the story, and by the time it was over I could understand why it now has such a devoted following. The book is an almost perfect blueprint for the movie (indeed, so many of Matheson's stories and novels have been adapted into visual media that he rivals Philip K. Dick in terms of influence on pop culture), and so has the exact same issues, including the fact that the central character - Collier - is such a lovestruck idiot that you can't help wondering how and why Elise would ever fall in love with him. It helped that Reeve played him, since that lessened the incredulity. But in the book, it is a glaring hole. Still, it is engrossing enough, and a must-read for fans of the film."}, {"userName": "Naomi", "userReviewDate": "Nov 11, 2015", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/36025780-naomi", "userReview": "(Spanish edition, review in both languages for my non spanish speaking friends)Tengo sentimientos encontrados con este libro.

I have mixed feelings about this book. At first I thought the story would be much more related to time travel but it is not, the book's plot is based on the efforts of Richard Collier to meet a woman he falls in love with after seeing her picture in a hotel. It has some romance, some time travel, mystery, suspense and drama. However, I think i expected more from this author, or this book at least. I have other books of him that I look forward to read because I'm sure i will like more than this one.The characters, Richard and Elise showed the clear differences of two people belonging to different eras. Elise seemed charming, but I found Richard skittish, desperate and sometimes even a little pervert. The book is narrated in the first person from his point of view, perhaps the character I liked the least; yet the story got me to the end. Richard has a certain condition that added the element of suspense to the plot, not knowing if the couple will have their happy ending. The ending was somewhat predictable but no less interesting. Did they really met or was it an illusion? It is up to the reader's imagination."}, {"userName": "Haili", "userReviewDate": "Feb 11, 2014", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/24778615-haili", "userReview": "This romantic story sets place in 1896 San Diego at a luxurious hotel with lots of history buried beneath it. The main character: Richard Collier who is struggling with a brain tumor has decided to run away and he lands in San Diego where he time travels to meet his one true love. The issue in this book is that Richard Collier has fallen in-love with a woman who is dead and has been dead for 75 years. This makes him kind of a creeper because he does all this research on her and keeps a picture of her with him. Richard Collier decides he is going to time travel back to the era of Elise McKenna known to be a famous actress or the person Richard Collier is in-love with. He learns how to time travel and soon finds himself in the year 1896 where he meets Elise, starts this relationship with her and finds himself in this trance that never ends. The thing that I didn't like was that Richard Collier was portrayed as a creeper and I don't think that the writer intended it to be that way ,but that's how it played out. It's not necessarily a bad thing ,but it takes away the romantic element in the story and replaces it with a creepy stalker who is way to young for a girl who is how many years older than him. I have seen the movie many times and never got the impression of a stalker until I read the book and now every time I watch the movie it ruins it for me knowing Richard is creepy. Another thing I didn't like was that it's weird how the cause of his brain tumor provided him to be able to time travel and was able to mentally picture himself in a different era. This book effected me in so many ways such as: Richard being a creeper, the passion to do anything to be with his loved one, the fact that Richard had a brain tumor, and that it was sad that 2 people from completely different eras were meant to be together ,but couldn't. In the end the writer leaves the reader hanging with not really giving us a conclusion ,he kind of leaves it up for the reader to decide the ending. So I think I would not recommend this book because I only liked it because I saw the movie and knew what would happen whereas someone who didn't watch the movie than read the book would be confused."}, {"userName": "Matthew Marcus", "userReviewDate": "Nov 18, 2015", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/6051915-matthew-marcus", "userReview": "A difficult one to rate.

What I wasn't so sure about was the couple of hundred pages in the middle once the narrator has reached 1896: he's frankly as wet and unprepossessing a protagonist as can be imagined, and seems rather fortunate to find the lady in question predisposed to fall madly and instantly in love with him for reasons that can best be described as \"er... magic?\" It also seems very, um, of its time that the full spate of this famous actress's talents is only finally unlocked by having sex with a helpful man.
