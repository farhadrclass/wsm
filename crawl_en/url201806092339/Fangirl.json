It\u2019s like hearing that Harry Potter is gay.\"\nOk, why the fuck are you referencing Harry Potter after having based the entire book around a fictionalized version of Harry Potter known as Simon Snow? Why?!If you wanted a true sense of fandom, don't look for it here. Don't get me wrong, I liked this book, but it is a coming-of-age book that was misrepresented as a book about fandom. This would have been so much better if it had been merely sold as a coming-of-age without the fandom aspect, but as a book that tries to sell fandom on me, it doesn't remotely work.I feel like this book represents online fandom in the way that The Big Bang Theory represents math geeks and engineers. It caricaturizes and mocks fangirls/boys for the enjoyment of the reader, and not much more. It does nothing to dispel the myths of the laughable socially inept fanboy/fangirl, and that's just a damned shame.The first 20% of the book focused lightly on the fandom, and then the book kind of forgot about it with the exception of the \"Simon Snow\" excerpts, which were absolutely fucking pointless to the story as a whole.The summary brought in the tantalizing question \"Will Cath be able to leave Simon Snow behind?\" That's just it! By that point in the book, we had almost forgotten completely about Simon Snow and Cath's involvement within the fandom! The story was enjoyable, and I absolutely loved the dynamics of the relationships between the characters, but that's it. I felt like it wasn't an adequate representation of being a fangirl.Of course, if I'm going to complain about the representation of fangirls in the book, I should show some street cred. You name it, I've probably squee'd over it. Harry Potter. Anime. J-pop. K-pop. Computer games. Tabletop games. I have RPG-ed, I have MMO-ed, I have LARP-ed. From computer games like World of Warcraft, which took over 6 hours of my day while enrolled in a full college courseload (you don't know the meaning of fun until you've teamed up with 39 other people to take down a virtual monster while drunk), to rolling dice while pretending that I was a 8-year old crazy vampire child wielding a doll (I AIN'T EVEN SORRY).Anime conventions. Gaming conventions. I've done them all.I know what it's like to be a fangirl. I am proud of it. Even of moments like these.I was in Anime Club, which is a rough club formed around people into gaming/anime/Asian cultures. Needless to say, we had plenty of weabos and otakus and strange people in general. There were a whole lot of socially awkward people there, including me. We were dorks, yeah, we weren't entirely comfortable in company outside our immediate circle, but we knew how to adapt (it's called looking around and doing what everyone else is doing, not exactly fucking rocket science). None of us gamers/geeks/assorted idiots have ever been so socially incompetent as Cath.Social Ineptitude\n\u201cI can\u2019t help it,\u201d Reagan said. \u201cYou\u2019re really pathetic.\u201d\u201cI am not.\u201d\u201cYou are. You don\u2019t have any friends, your sister dumped you, you\u2019re a freaky eater...And you\u2019ve got some weird thing about Simon Snow.\u201d\nIf you looked up neuroses under the Psychiatric DSM IV, you would find Cath's picture in the title page.This book does a disservice to fangirls in general by making Cath so incredibly, painfully socially incompetent. I would have liked this book better if it had remained a contemporary, instead, this book chooses to perpetuate the worst of beliefs about fangirls---which is to say, they're all fucking idiots who wouldn't know the word \"normal\" if it were summoned from a Patronus (god help you, my child, if you don't get that reference).Cath is drawn to be the person who wouldn't last 5 seconds alone in the wilderness, let alone a college campus. She is terrified of social interactions. She stocks up on food so she wouldn't have to face the terrifying, the monstrous, the ever-so-menacing...dining hall.\nCath broke open a box of protein bars. She had four more boxes and three giant jars of peanut butter shoved under her bed. If she paced herself, she might not have to face the dining hall until October.\nHer life revolves around her twin (Wren) and the Simon Snow series. Cath is not an appealing character. Her hyper-clumsiness aside, she just has no fucking common sense. In an upper-level Fiction Writing class, she tries to pass off fanfiction as her own work. She then tries to submit it for a grade.\n\u201cOur professor asked us to write a scene with an untrustworthy narrator. I wrote something about Simon and Baz...She didn\u2019t get it. She thought it was plagiarism.\u201d Cath forced herself to use that word, felt the tar wake up with a twist in her stomach.\nFucking brilliant.Cath is sort of a Mary Sue. She goes off on a writing partner for writing a Mary Sue in his story, but if you think about it, Cath sort of is one herself. She's so brilliant that she gets into an upper-div writing class with a famous professor, and we never really see what kind of talent she has besides writing fanfiction. She is so good that an upperclassman wants to be her partner for it. Cath does nothing exemplary, and she's incredibly fucking weird, and regardless, a cute, a funny, a really awesome guy just wants her.She doesn't think of herself as beautiful, but identical sister is referred to as \"hot.\" HMMMMMMMMM.What Fandom?! From what we hear, Cath spent all her time writing Simon Snow fanfiction and going to premieres and chatting with her twin about Simon Snow...but that was in high school. No more of that.In fact, if you wanted to hear and learn about fandom, you'd be better off stopping at around 20% of the book. Because that's pretty much where life interferes. Except for a few brief moments of Cath reading and telling people about her fanfiction writing and about her love of fanfiction---we almost never hear about the \"fangirl\" aspect of the book again. This would have---and in fact, is, a completely solid book on dealing with family and friends and growing up. It's just NOT A BOOK ABOUT FANDOM BECAUSE THE FANDOM IS SOLIDLY RELEGATED TO THE BACKSEAT. YOU COULD GET MORE INFORMATION ABOUT FANDOM ON WIKIPEDIA.Where are all the forum discussions?Where are all the interactions with fellow fans?Where's the Tumblr?Where's the talking to fellow friends online for hours and hours on end because you're both fangirling so much that words are spilling over and you are just so happy to find a fellow fan?Where is the daydreaming?Where is the magic?What little of the fandom that existed in this book was restricted to Cath. Cath. Cath. The Great Cath. Where is the fucking COMMUNITY?The greatest part about any fandom is the community. We're all on Goodreads here, we love the books, but almost as importantly, we love interacting with one another, we love knowing that somewhere out there, there are people who understand us.This book doesn't represent that at all. It is solidly about Cath and her legions of fans. her 20,000 hits per fanfiction.net clone. Her full-of-it based on that fact. The fact that she, herself, has fans.\nCath tried not to let it all go to her head. These characters belong to Gemma T. Leslie, she wrote at the beginning of every new chapter.\nThis book is about a girl who is full of herself.The Writing: It tries too hard to be quirky. It works, at times, but some moments, and some sentences just made me wince.\nHis eyes were set so deep, it made everything he said more intense.\nYOU DON'T SAY!\nHis mouth was small, but bowed. Like a doll\u2019s. She wondered if he had trouble opening it wide enough to eat apples.\nWhat the fuck?!\nHe was wearing a thick, navy blue turtleneck sweater that made him look like he was serving on a Soviet battleship.\nSeriously?!\nShe heard the very beginning of a smile in his voice\u2014a fetal smile\u2014and it very nearly killed her.\nI'd understand \"fatal\" smile, but \"fetal?\"\nInside, her internal organs were grinding themselves into nervous pulp. Her intestines were gone. Her kidneys were disintegrating. Her stomach was wringing itself out, yanking on her trachea.\nBAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAARFThe Good: I fucking loved the relationships between the characters in the book. Wren and Cath. Their father and the twins. Reagan and Cath. Levi and Cath. The relationships were wonderfully, beautifully written, honest and realistic. I love the love, anger, and resentment between Cath and Wren.\n\u201cAre you the older or younger twin?\u201dShe shrugged. \u201cIt was a C-section. But Wren was bigger. She was stealing my juice or something. I had to stay in the hospital for three weeks after she went home.\u201dCath didn\u2019t tell him that sometimes she felt like Wren was still taking more than her fair share of life, like she was siphoning vitality off Cath\u2014or like she was born with a bigger supply.\nI adored their awesome, manic father. He is the sweetest, cutest dad. This may sound gross, but I kind of have a dad-crush on him.\n\u201cCath? It\u2019s your dad again. It\u2019s still late, but I couldn\u2019t wait to tell you this. You know how you guys want a bathroom upstairs? Your room is right over the bathroom. We could put in a trapdoor. And a ladder. It would be like a secret shortcut to the bathroom. Isn\u2019t this a great idea? Call me. It\u2019s your dad.\u201d\nReagan and Cath's relationship was the most unexpected, and the sweetest. I love the rough-around-the-edges Reagan. I loved her strength, I love her take-no-prisoners approach when it comes to pulling Cath out of her hermitage, and I love Reagan's unexpected moments of vulnerability.\n\u201cNo,\u201d Reagan said, \u201cwe\u2019ve got to get this out of the way. You can\u2019t be jealous. And in return, I won\u2019t flex my best-friend muscles just to remind myself that he loved me first.\u201d\u201cOh my God\u201d\u2014Cath clutched her comforter in disbelief\u2014\u201cwould you actually do that?\u201d\u201cI might,\u201d Reagan said, leaning forward, her face as shocked as Cath\u2019s. \u201cIn a moment of weakness. You\u2019ve got to understand, I\u2019ve been [his] favorite girl practically my whole life.\"\nOverall: a solid book if you are willing to read it for what it actually is: a contemporary coming of age. This is not a book that accurately represents fandom."}, {"userName": "\"That's All\" Ash", "userReviewDate": "Sep 09, 2013", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/5606933-that-s-all-ash", "userReview": "It\u2019s like Rainbow Rowell writes in peanut butter and stolen moments and lazy eyelash wishes.\u2665That\u2019s the best and only way I can describe it.\u2665It\u2019s 433 pages of a guaranteed good day.I\u2019m so jealous of you guys right now, it\u2019s crazy!Because I can\u2019t read this book for the first time again.So when you finish it, and you\u2019re just sitting there all thoughtful and wordless (grinning like an 8th grader with prom tickets)\u2026 You\u2019re not alone. ;) \nThis book\u2019s about the good ol\u2019 college experience.*ahem*\u2026 The Realistic Kind.\nBut more importantly, it\u2019s about Cath Avery\u2019s college experience and all the life lessons in between.Cath is such a phenomenal character. Because she\u2019s both tough and endearing. Plus, she has this super quick and snarky wit that\u2019s freaking hilarious in every way possible! And she\u2019s kind of this cool eccentric, totally awkward girl. I mean, she writes fan fiction and she\u2019s famous (but anonymous) for it, people make her nervous (which is where that snarky wit of hers comes in), and she has a twin sister who\u2019s also her best friend and is Cath\u2019s total opposite.But I think my favorite thing about Cath is that she\u2019s so damn relatable! She worries about the same things you and I do (like, \u201cGood god\u2026 what happens when and if I\u2019m late to class? Should I knock? Just walk right in and give the professor my coffee and pretend that\u2019s why I was late in the first place? Should I bearcrawl my way to my seat and hope no one notices?). Just random, stupid things like that but that totally make a difference when you\u2019re in the moment, know what I mean?And she\u2019s always been so codependent on her fanfiction stories and on her very independent twin sister\u2026 that she gets to college and finds out that she can\u2019t be that way anymore. She has to learn to speak up for herself, and to be that awkward girl, and to be totally okay with it! So in a way, this book\u2019s about first experiences (the good and the bad) and seeing it through the eyes of an awesome/awkward/totally kickass girl who\u2019s both the girl she was and the girl she\u2019s going to be.\nYou\u2019re also going to meet these completely hilarious and awesome characters\u2026 who aren\u2019t just characters, they\u2019re people full of character.*Like Reagan, Cath\u2019s dorm roomie.\n\n She did everything so forcefully. She swung their door open; she slammed it shut. She was bigger than Cath, a little taller and lot more buxom (seriously, buxom). She just seemed bigger. On the inside, too.\n\n*Wren, her sister.\n\n Wren had always been the Social One. The Friendly One. The one who got invited to quinceaneras and birthday parties. But before\u2014in junior high and high school\u2014everyone knew that if you invited Wren, you got Cath. They were a package deal, even at dances. There were three years\u2019 worth of photos, taken at every homecoming, of Cath and Wren standing with their dates under an archway of balloons or in front of a glittery curtain.They were a package deal, period. Since always.\n\n*Cath\u2019s single-parent dad.\n\n \u201cDad?\u201d\u201cHey, Cath.\u201d\u201cDad. Why haven\u2019t you called me? I left you a million messages.\u201d\u201cYou left me too many messages. You shouldn\u2019t be calling me or even thinking about me. You\u2019re in college now. Move on.\u201d\u201cIt\u2019s just school, Dad. It\u2019s not like we have irreconcilable differences.\u201d\u201cHoney, I\u2019ve watched a lot of 90210. The parents weren\u2019t even on the show once Brandon and Brenda went to college. This is your time\u2014you\u2019re supposed to be going to frat parties and getting back together with Dylan.\u201d\u201cWhy does everyone want me to go to frat parties?\u201d\u201cWho wants you to go to frat parties? I was just kidding. Don\u2019t hang out with frat guys, Cath, they\u2019re terrible. All they do is get drunk and watch 90210.\u201d\n\n*And there\u2019s \u2665Levi\u2665.Levi\u2019s definitely my runner-up for favorite character. He\u2019s not the hottest guy on campus and he\u2019s not all broody and oozing sex appeal. He\u2019s the guy you want to come home to when there are puddles rivering through the sidewalks, and he\u2019s the cute guy you want to call when you\u2019ve just had the best two minutes of your life and you want to tell someone, and he\u2019s the cute and amazing guy you want to walk you home late at night and who\u2019s going to open your doors for you and make you laugh when your lower lip\u2019s trembling from trying to hold a bad day in. Levi\u2019s just that guy who every girl is going to meet, has already met, and wants to meet. Does that make sense? He\u2019s realistic, because he\u2019s completely imperfect and is perfect in the ways that matter. Especially for Cath. They go from being acquaintances, to friends, and turn into something inseparable.\nAnd these two banter the entire way through that\u2019s going to make you laugh and keep you laughing.\n(talking about Wren, her twin sister, and Wren's boyfriend)  \"Maybe we should go on lots of double dates,\" Cath said, \"and then we can get married on the same day in a double ceremony, in matching dresses, and the four of us will light the unity candle all at the same time.\"\"Pfft,\" Levi said, \"I'm picking out my own dress.\" \nThe way these two characters intertwine with each other and evolve towards each other in the book is where the story really is. Because they go from bantering friends to two people who become solid in each other\u2019s lives. Their relationship is sweet, funny, comfortable, and comforting. All in one. And there\u2019s just this overall warmth about them when they\u2019re together on the page.\nSo we\u2019re barely in September\u2026 and I\u2019m already thinking about going ahead and giving this book the \nBest Book of the Year\n award. And I think I\u2019m going to. Because books like this don\u2019t come around too often and I\u2019d be lucky to read a book like this in the next five years.Fucking amazing."}, {"userName": "Jesse (JesseTheReader)", "userReviewDate": "Aug 17, 2013", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/8114361-jesse-jessethereader", "userReview": "IDK WHAT TO SAY OTHER THAN I LOVED IT.

It's like that time I cheerfully broke up with Cassandra Clare, though, admittedly, over different reasons. But this time it hurts. It wounds me to realize that I can't join in with all my friends, ride the\u00a0Rainbow iz Queen\u00a0bandwagon, roll around in a meadow of flowers that magically whispers witty Rainbow Rowell quotes and feast at the Fangirl banquet. I know it may seem foolish to be disappointed. I mean, what can a person physically do? No book can be universally loved and I did give it the good old college try.Here's the thing: For all intents and purposes, I should have loved Fangirl.\u00a0The strange thing about my reading experience with\u00a0Fangirl is that I actually deeply connected with all of the characters on a personal level. As a person who suffers from anxiety and has dealt with a father who was admitted to a mental hospital when I was a teen, I sympathized with Cath. I remembered those feelings of craving independence from my sibling as Wren did. I understand having an intense passion for a fandom and being at midnight parties, waiting for the next book in your favorite series. I even connected with Laura's inability to handle life as a mom. In a lot of ways, quite a few of the experiences these characters\u00a0dealt with, I have dealt with.\u00a0For that reason alone, I gave this book an extra star. Unfortunately, that was not enough for me.Rainbow Rowell lives and breathes characters. They are fluid, realistic (for the most part... Eleanor & Park excluded), memorable, flawed, and relatable. These aren't the type of characters that stay on the page. They shout, scream and jump out at you\u00a0because Rowell is just that good. But it's\u00a0also her flaw because that's all she writes, characters. In fact, many times it feels like her stories have neither a beginning or an ending, with the reader viewing a piece of a character's\u00a0life through a small window of time. So\u00a0I'm convinced that Rowell can't plot her way out of a brown paper bag.I know that might anger some of you, but hear me out.Fangirl is a very character-driven novel and doesn't actually have a plot. Rowell's created these characters,\u00a0placed them in situations and forced them to react to said situations. She's great at that. But where does the book go from there? Which direction are the characters moving? What are they moving towards? What's the goal of the novel? These are some questions I've asked myself through every one of her books. And I often feel like I'm floundering around in her prose\u00a0like someone who's gone swimming in the ocean drunk. Everything around these characters is static. Only they move from point A to point B to further the story along. Because of this, if you don't happen to fall in love with the characters\u00a0early on, the story doesn't work. Rainbow Rowell's characters ARE her stories.One thing positive that came out of reading all of Rowell's books is that, I've learned that I am not the character-driven sort of reader. I'm more of a reader that needs a strong plot to see me to the end of the book. I can deal with unlikable characters or characters that have issues if the plot can save the day. I have the patience of a fruit fly and if I'm expected to sit around reading about a character who is waiting for something to happen to them, then forget it. You've lost me as a reader.The second issue I had with Fangirl was Rowell, once again, tip-toeing around elephants in her stories. Her novels are so focused on her characters that she never addresses things that feel essential to the plot. With Fangirl is was the slash fic and how it relates to fandom. With Landline it was the magical phone. With Eleanor and Park it was race and Park's self acceptance. It's the same formula for each of her books over and over again.Step 1: Develop characters for half the book!Step 2: Introduce something\u00a0heavy\u00a0to center my quirky characters around something.Step 3: End the book without tying up loose ends because they served my purpose and Honey Rainbow don't care.It's the most frustrating thing about her books! It's like she dances around the heavy stuff on purpose! There is almost always something that feels deliberately left out, basically anything that could remotely make the story more interesting. Which leads me to my third point...Fangirl is boring. While I could relate to Cath, she is the dullest person to read about ever. The only scenes that she showed life with was either with her dad or Levi when she suddenly had a personality and\u00a0wanted\u00a0to be witty. Those scenes were the best in the book and what kept me reading. But they were few and far between and I started to question why this book was over 400 pages. Not even the fan fiction or cute romance could save this book.And let's talk about this Simon and Baz fan fiction. Clearly it is a homage to Harry Potter, yet, Harry Potter happens to exist in the same universe as Simon Snow? No, I don't buy that. That's a plotberg if I ever saw one. The fan fiction sections in the novel really didn't do much for me. This isn't because it wasn't good, but because it didn't have enough page time for me to attempt to connect with the Simon and Baz. I did feel like bashing my head in when Cath would read Levi the long sections of\u00a0her fic, so I guess they did spawn some type of emotional reaction in me, albeit, not a positive one. Also, did Cath ever finish her fic? Rowell wrote so much about Simon and Baz and just completely left that open... AGAIN FRUSTRATING.Side note: I'm really curious to see how Rowell manages to write Carry On, Cath's fan fiction of Simon Snow,\u00a0without people directly comparing it to Harry Potter. I mean,\u00a0essentially it's Draco/Harry fic. But since monetizing\u00a0fan fiction is now a thing, *cough* Cassandra Clare, E.L. James *cough* who am I to stop her?To conclude, Fangirl\u00a0ultimately let me down, but I'm not entirely disappointed that I read it. I learned something about myself as a reader and I did gain a few good laughs from the clever banter. I wouldn't call this a terrible book, and hey, it was better than Eleanor and Park. So there's always that.I'm such a goddamn hipster, I swear.

Though the way I feel about it is almost exactly how I feel about Eleanor & Park. They are both cute books with complex, well-developed characters, and yet I feel like something is missing that just holds both books back from being truly memorable.Rowell writes quirky, detailed characters that are different and honest. I liked the antisocial, awkward and weird Cath. I thought her story - both as a popular fanfic writer and as a new college student - seemed very unique and it was, for the most part, enjoyable, funny and occasionally moving. I have my own history of social awkwardness so I related to a lot of the strange and hilarious things she did.Some readers didn't like Cath's desire to hole up in her room and eat protein bars because she wanted to avoid the awkwardness of the cafeteria, but this wasn't an issue for me. Unfortunately, I get these little things that plague us socially awkward people. I actually found it quite endearing.And, unlike some other readers, I enjoyed the fanfiction aspect. I've never been much of a fanfic reader/writer myself, but I have been the kind of person who has been completely obsessed with a fandom, and I have never read a book that has done anything quite like this one. Props for creativity.So... yes, I like the characters, and yes, I like the dialogue, but I feel there is something lacking in the plot/story arc of the two Rowell books I've read. I guess they are introspective \"coming-of-age\" books that don't really have much of a story, and I tend to feel like not much has happened or been achieved by the novel's close.It's odd, though, because I often enjoy character-driven stories. For some reason, with Rowell, it never seems to be enough. I quite like her books while I'm reading them, but I get the impression that in a month's time, I won't be able to name a single character from this book.Blog | Facebook | Twitter | Instagram | Youtube | Pinterest"}, {"userName": "Kristin (KC) - Traveling Sister", "userReviewDate": "Sep 11, 2013", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/4971692-kristin-kc---traveling-sister", "userReview": "[Yes (hide spoiler)]"}, {"userName": "Zo\u00eb", "userReviewDate": "Nov 29, 2013", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/9303625-zo", "userReview": "Reread October 2015: AHHHHH I felt all the love for this book that I felt the first time plus more!

And it does its job every single time, which I\u2019m more than grateful for. It\u2019s like a consolation, an old friend, a favorite old, comfy sweater. Fangirl is everything.And because of its importance to me, it\u2019s my most reread novel and I love it through and through.This follows Cath through her freshman year at the University of Nebraska, along with her much more outgoing identical twin sister Wren. But Cath is having a hard time adjusting to college.This review contains *spoilers*.But thanks to her writing fanfiction to a dedicated book series - following the adventures of Simon and Baz - she manages 'to disappear.' To get free of herself, to make people laugh, to stop being anything or anywhere at all. As I mentioned at the start of my review, Fangirl is very near and dear to my heart. I reread it at least once a year, and could probably quote passages of it by heart (which I'm pretty proud of). It introduced me to a new world that I consider to be like a second family.Rainbow Rowell came up with such fantastic characters and the dynamics between all of them blows me away every time.Like, it physically hurts trying to stop smiling when Cath and Levi or Cath and Reagan have a scene together.And I, of course, have to feature one of my favorite interactions between Cath and Reagan:\u201cYou\u2019re making me feel sorry for you again,\u201d Reagan said.Cath turned her fork on Reagan. \u201cDon\u2019t feel sorry for me. I don\u2019t want you to feel sorry for me.\u201d\u201cI can\u2019t help it,\u201d Reagan said. \u201cYou\u2019re really pathetic.\u201d\u201cI am not.\u201d\u201cYou are. You don\u2019t have any friends, your sister dumped you, you\u2019re a freaky eater \u2026 And you\u2019ve got some weird thing about Simon Snow.\u201d\u201cI object to every single thing you just said.\u201dI can totally see why Cath and Reagan hit it off.SourceOh, and since I happened to mention Levi (so casually), I will just say that he is one the sweetest character I\u2019ve ever had the pleasure to read about. I mean, I actually felt homesick the first time I finished reading Fangirl because I couldn't believe I was done. I missed Levi for weeks (and rereading it only made it that more painful).The first time Cath read to Levi has and always will be ingrated into my heart:\u201cLevi laughed, and she tried to grab her pillow from him. He held it to his chest with both hands. \u201cCather\u2026\u201d\u201cDon\u2019t call me that.\u201d\u201cRead me some of your secret, dirty fanfiction.\u201d\u201cIt\u2019s not dirty.\u201d\u201cRead me some anyway.\u201dShe let go of the pillow; he\u2019d probably already filthed it beyond redemption.\u201cWhy?\u201d\u201cBecause I\u2019m curious,\u201d he said. \u201cAnd I like stories.\u201d\u201cYou just want to make fun of me.\u201d\u201cI won\u2019t,\u201d he said. \u201cI promise.\u201dAnd then to top it off, Levi used one of my favorite expressions\u2014 \u201cTo be continued.\u201d\u201cCome on.\u201d Reagan turned to Levi. \u201cPlant Phys. Are we doing this?\u201d\u201cWe\u2019re doing it,\u201d he grumbled, sliding off Cath\u2019s bed. \u201cCan I use your phone?\u201d he asked her.Cath handed him her phone, and he punched a number in. His back pocket started playing a Led Zeppelin song. \u201cTo be continued,\u201d he said, handing it back to her. \u201cSolid?\u201d\u201cSure,\u201d Cath said.\u201dAnd Levi being Levi, he kept his promise to Cath and gave me one of the most memorable book scenes of all time:\u201cCath shuffled the pages with her thumb.\u2026 It really was a short book. With tons of dialogue.She looked up at Levi. The sun was setting behind her, and he was sitting in a wash of orange light.Cath turned her chair toward the bed, knocking his feet without warning to the ground. Then she rested her own feet on the bed frame and took off her glasses, tucking them in her hair. \u201c\u2018When I stepped out into the bright sunlight from the darkness of the movie house\u2014\u2019\u201d\u201cCath,\u201d Levi whispered. She felt her chair wobble and knew he was kicking it. \u201cYou don\u2019t have to do that.\u201d\u201cObviously,\u201d she said. \u201c\u2018When I stepped out into the bright sunlight\u2014\u2019\u201d\u201cCather.\u201dShe cleared her throat, still focused on the book. \u201cShut up, I owe you one. At least one. And also, I\u2019m trying to read here.\u2026\u201dIt hurts so good. They are my sun and stars.\u201cIt was really late. And too dark in the room to be reading this much. Cath\u2019s voice was rough now, like someone had run a dull knife across it. Like she was recovering from a cold or a crying jag.At some point Levi had put his left arm around her and pulled her back against his chest\u2014she\u2019d been fidgeting and rubbing her back on the wall, and Levi just reached behind her and pulled her into him.\u201dI've read this scene so many times, and it still gives me chills. I honestly needed a minute to slow down my heart. And my stomach\u2014too many damn butterflies.\u201cYou okay?\u201d he asked.She nodded again. And then she felt him slowly moving. \u201cHere\u2026\u201dLevi slid down the wall onto the bed, resting on his side, then tugged Cath down so she was lying on her back in front of him\u2014his arm beneath her head like a pillow. She relaxed her shoulders and felt warm flannel against the back of her neck.\u201cBetter?\u201d he asked in his superscript voice. He was looking at her face. Giving Cath a chance to say no without having to say it out loud. She didn\u2019t speak. Or nod. Or answer. Instead she looked down and shifted slightly toward him onto her side, leaning the book against his chest.She started reading again, and felt Levi\u2019s elbow curve around her shoulder.\u201dI'm literally sweating because of them.\u201cCath closed the book and let it fall on Levi\u2019s chest, not sure what happened next. Not sure she was awake, all things considered.The moment it fell, he pulled her into him. Onto him. With both arms. Her chest pressed against his, and the paperback slid between their stomachs.Cath\u2019s eyes were half closed, and so were Levi\u2019s\u2014and his lips only looked small from afar, she realized, because of their doll-like pucker. They were perfectly big, really, now that she had a good look at them. Perfectly something.He nudged his nose against hers, and their mouths fell sleepily together, already soft and open.\u201dIs it physically possible to love a fictional relationship this much??SourceAnd I could go on and on about him, but I think it's best (for my heart) if I quietly move on to my next couple of favorites moments and people.The first being: Magicath and Wrenegade.I just wanted to mention how truly great the close bond they had with one another was:\u201cThey listened to each other when they wouldn\u2019t listen to anyone else.\u201dI love this sentence so much because it perfectly describes how they have each other's back.\u201cI\u2019m like him,\u201d she\u2019d whispered.\u201cYou\u2019re not,\u201d Wren said.\u201cI am. I\u2019m crazy like him.\u201d She was already having panic attacks. She was already hiding at parties. In seventh grade, she\u2019d been late to class for the first two weeks because she couldn\u2019t stand being in the halls with everyone else during passing periods. \u201cIt\u2019s probably going to get worse in a few years. That\u2019s when it usually kicks in.\u201d\u201cYou\u2019re not,\u201d Wren said.\u201cBut what if I am?\u201d\u201cDecide not to be.\u201d\u201cThat\u2019s not how it works,\u201d Cath argued.\u201cNobody knows how it works.\u201d\u201cWhat if I don\u2019t even see it coming?\u201d\u201cI\u2019ll see it coming.\u201dCath tried to stop crying, but she\u2019d been crying so long, the crying had taken over, making her breathe in harsh sniffs and jerks.\u201cIf it tries to take you,\u201d Wren said, \u201cI won\u2019t let go.\u201dThis really hit home for me. Everything Cath said and did is something I've said or done before. And it scares me to no end. So I really appreciated when Cath had Wren to talk to. The way Wren had her made my heart soar.SourceAlso, I want to briefly mention the girl in the library because she was a literal angel. I think about her daily:\u201cMagicath is my absolute favorite,\u201d the girl interrupted, like she couldn\u2019t hold it back. \u201cI\u2019m obsessed with Carry On. Have you been keeping up?\u201d\u201cYeah.\u201d\u201cShe\u2019s been posting so much lately. Every time there\u2019s a new chapter, I have to stop everything to read it. And then read it again. My roommate thinks I\u2019m crazy.\u201d\u201cMine, too.\u201d\u201cBut it\u2019s just so good. Nobody writes Simon and Baz like Magicath. I\u2019m in love with her Baz. Like, in love. And I used to be a major Simon/Agatha shipper.\u201dCath wrinkled her nose. \u201cNo.\u201d\u201cI know, I was young.\u201dI\u2019m smiling so much, it hurts.\u201cIt killed me how long it took Simon and Baz to get together. And now I\u2019m dying for them to have a big love scene. That\u2019s my only complaint about Carry On\u2014not enough Simon/Baz action.\u201d\u201cShe almost never writes love scenes,\u201d Cath said, feeling her cheeks pink.\u201cYeah, but when she does, they\u2019re hot.\u201d\u201cYou think?\u201d\u201cUm,\u201d the girl laughed. \u201cYes.\u201d\u201cThis is why people think we\u2019re crazy perverts,\u201d Cath said.The girl just giggled some more. \u201cI know. Sometimes I forget that there\u2019s still a real book coming out\u2014like, it\u2019s hard for me to imagine that the story is going to end any other way than the way Magicath writes it.\u201dShe perfectly describes how I feel.And, funnily enough, the first time I read this book I wasn't expecting it to be so hilarious. Fangirl, while still handling really important issues, has such an impeccable sense of humor. There\u2019s this one instance in particular that I love because I can\u2019t help but crack up every time I read it:\u201cAnd besides, Cath still wasn\u2019t sure whether Nick was actually hot or whether he just projected hotness. Specifically in her direction.Someone sat down next to her on the bench, and Cath glanced up from her phone. Nick tilted his chin up in greeting.\u201cThink of the devil,\u201d she said, then wished she hadn\u2019t.\u201cYou thinking about me?\u201d\u201cI was thinking \u2026 of the devil,\u201d Cath said stupidly.\u201dThis is my style of humor.And on a completely unrelated note, I know I said I was done talking about Levi, but I have to mention this scene from their first date, because reasons:\u201cShe stepped away from him, and he took her hand. \u201cWait,\u201d he said. \u201cI think there might be an evergreen over there\u2014\u201dCath looked up.\u201cFalse alarm,\u201d he said, squeezing her hand.She shivered.\u201cAre you cold?\u201dShe shook her head.He squeezed her hand again. \u201cGood.\u201dHe is so damn smooth. Rainbow Rowell wrote their relationship so well that even I felt nervous whenever Levi touched Cath's hand.\u201cYou\u2019re not all hands\u2026,\u201d he whispered later. He was tucked back into the corner of the love seat, and she was resting on top of him. She\u2019d spent hours on top of him. Curled over him like a vampire. Even exhausted, she couldn\u2019t stop rubbing her numb lips into his flannel chest. \u201cYou\u2019re all mouth,\u201d he said.\u201cSorry,\u201d Cath said, biting her lips.\u201cDon\u2019t be stupid,\u201d he said, pulling her lips free of her teeth with his thumb. \u201cAnd don\u2019t be sorry \u2026 ever again.\u201dHe hitched her up, so her face was above his. Her eyes wandered down to his chin, out of habit. \u201cLook at me,\u201d he said.Cath looked up. At Levi\u2019s pastel-colored face. Too lovely, too good.\u201cI like you here,\u201d he said, squeezing her. \u201cWith me.\u201dShe smiled, and her eyes started to drift downward.\u201cCather\u2026\u201dBack up to his eyes.\u201cYou know that I\u2019m falling in love with you, right?\u201dI totally smiled a Levi smile at this part. My stomach was wringing itself out every time Cath and Levi had a scene together.SourceI also loved the fact that Reagan gave Cath and Levi ground rules because same:\u201cWhat are the ground rules?\u201dReagan held up a finger. Her nails were long and pink.\u201cOne. Nobody talks to me about sex.\u201d\u201cDone.\u201d\u201cTwo, no lovey-dovey stuff in front of me.\u201d\u201cDone and done. I\u2019m telling you, there is no lovey-dovey stuff.\u201d\u201cThree, shut up, nobody talks to me about their relationship.\u201dCath nodded. \u201cFine.\u201d\u201cFour\u2026\u201d\u201cYou\u2019ve really been thinking about this, haven\u2019t you?\u201dI aspire to reach her level of coolness. Reagan wasn\u2019t anybody\u2019s fool.I love and root for everyone in this world so damn much. And\u00a0it never fails to make me feel incredibly sad to reach the end of Fangirl. I'm in such a haze while reading it, it\u2019s like everything surrounding me disappears into oblivion. This book has my heart and soul.And I mean, I don\u2019t know Rainbow Rowell, but I still wholeheartedly trust her. She somehow makes me love Fangirl in a new way every time I read it, and I'm so grateful.I also kept looking for the perfect way to describe how deeply personal this book feels, and I finally found it with this quote by Laurie Halse Anderson:\u201cYou can tell a book is real when your heart beats faster. Real books make you sweat. Cry, if no one is looking. Real books help you make sense of your crazy life. Real books tell it true, don\u2019t hold back, and make you stronger. But most of all, real books give you hope. Because it\u2019s not always going to be like this and books\u2014the good ones, the real ones\u2014show you how to make it better. Now.\u201d\u2014Laurie Halse Anderson5/5 stars (without a doubt)*Note: I'm an Amazon Affiliate. If you're interested in buying Fangirl, just click on the image below to go through my link.

(And yes, before you ask, the titles do refer to fangirling lore)1. My Body is ReadyI was quite excited to read Fangirl, at first. Trusted GR friends have loved this book, and I thought it would actually be -a bit- about the fangirling life (which I have been living fully for a year and a half, so I was like \u201cOooh, my ELEMENT, yay!\u201d)Dear Got in Himmel, was I wrong. Anyway. Let the Games Reviewing begin.2. OMG You did NOT just GO THEREYou see, what\u2019s her name (God, when I dislike the book I just can\u2019t remember main characters. Cath was it?) supposedly fangirls over are a fictionalized version of Harry Potter. It consists of 8 books revolving around a boy wizard chosen to defeat...something. Ring any bells? This immediately annoyed me because everyone who\u2019s hasn't lived in a cave for the past 20 years knows about Harry Potter. So to recreate an obvious copy of that for book purposes is weird to say the least. Writing bits of said, um, copy is even more unnerving because who cares about teeny tiny excerpts of a non-existing book which copies another one? Adding other, fanfiction excerpts based upon this non-existing copy of a book is just ridiculous. And I was willing to let go of the obvious HP plagiarism if for copyright reasons the author couldn\u2019t include excerpts (which were pointless but let\u2019s go with it) or names or whatever. But then the author confirmed what I was already thinking and I swear I wanted to throw my reader against the wall. THIS.\u201cTHE MAGIC WORD IS PLEASE.\u201dWell then. Anyone who\u2019s read Harry Potter semi-carefully knows that line. EVERYONE. And then (in case people were still wondering) this: \"It\u2019s like hearing that Harry Potter [...]\u201d Immediate reaction: DUDE. YOU DID NOT JUST GO THERE. I WAS WILLING TO GIVE YOU THE BENEFIT OF THE DOUBT, THINKING YOU DIDN\u2019T DARE MENTION HP AND HERE WE GO. OMFG YOU SUCK, YOU SUCK SO MUCH I CAN\u2019T EVEN DEAL RIGHT NOW (This, by the way, is the opposite of fangirling. Well it\u2019s fangirling, but negatively. You know, in defense of something you love) Seriously. Whoever let this be a part of the book and let it be so atrociously done does not deserve to give anyone advice.3. What is air? What is life? To top all that, the general writing isn\u2019t good.\u201cHis eyes were set so deep, it made everything he said more intense.\u201dSay what?\u201csince Wren drunked at her.\u201d Um, again, what?! \u201cHis lips were thin but dark, the same color as the inside of his mouth\u201d OMG WHAT IS THIS, THIS CALLS FOR THE OTTER\u201cexploitive\u201d I know, technically this exists, but it hurts my eyes. IT\u2019S EXPLOITATIVE*lies down in order to recuperate*The writing of the Simon Snow excerpts is terrible.\u201cmy fair share of apple-cheeked protagonism\u201d*cause of death: cringing*\u201cShe knew she was lovely, and she shared it like a gift. Every smile from Agatha was like waking up to a perfect sunny day. Agatha knew it. And she smiled at everyone who crossed her path, as if it were the most generous thing she could offer.\u201d*suddenly resuscitates (because maybe I died in the Murder House from AHS and now I\u2019m haunting it with the rest of the ghosts. Like Tate. Oh Tate\u2026) and dies AGAIN*The writing of the Simon Snow Fanfiction parts is abysmal. \u201cAnyway, it was totally forgivable because woodfoul and spiders and rats.\u201d It is NOT OK to write in that manner in something you consider a \u201cbook\u201d, this isn\u2019t Twitter! (Also, woodfoul?!)\u201cSimon twisted his lips to one side\u201d What? How? OMG.Also, for your pleasure, a bit of a recap of all the times eyes/hair are mentioned in either SS or FF SS.Thingy #1 (I can\u2019t be bothered to research the storyception names, sorry)\u2018s hair/eyes-\tcold, grey eyes-\tpearl grey eyes-\tslick, black hair-\tdark-haired boy-\this smoky grey eyes-\this long face as grey as his eyes in the gloaming.-\tHe flicked his black hair-\this grey eyes glintingThingy #2\u2019s hair/eyes-\tSimon\u2019s caramel brown hair. -\this eyes as wide and blue as the Eighth Sea-\tit did nothing to dim his blue eyes or blunt his glare. -\tthe thick fall of bronze hair partially trapped in his gogglesAnd other people\u2019s hair/eyes:-\tgirl with the red hair-\tShe had pigtails and old-fashioned pointy spectacles Basically\u2026I don\u2019t know, maybe I\u2019m doing the whole life thing wrong. Should I have started my review with \u201cHi, I\u2019m Cecile with dark-blonde-but-sometimes-not-so-blonde-but-the-tips-are-lighter-hair with blue-with-hazel-specks-but-sit-depends-on-the-lighting eyes and I\u2019ll be boring you reviewing this book.\u201d No?I still don\u2019t know if the quality of the FF writing in Fangirl is on purpose to show how bad fanfiction can be but considering the theme of the book I\u2019m betting the irony wouldn\u2019t go that far. (Unfortunately) Which brings me to the next part. 4. *dying whale noise*Naming this book \u201cFangirl\u201d was ridiculous. If you haven\u2019t ever fangirled over anything you\u2019re bound to find it stupid because you probably find fangirls annoying or don\u2019t even know what it refers too. Or you just assume they\u2019re rabid 12 year-old fans who obsess over boy-band members/actors, etc. Which happens, but that's really not what fangirling is about.If you are in a fandom however, you will likely be insulted by this book and its misrepresentation of the whole process. Which, you\u2019ll have guessed, is what happened to me. I. Am. A. Fangirl.I didn\u2019t think I\u2019d ever be, but then I read The Trilogy. Oh wait, should I call it by some incredibly subtle code-name? Such as The Arena Paradox ? The Panem Diversion? The Katniss Paradigm? No I am not just picking BBT episode titles at random and adding HG stuff to itAnyway. I\u2019m a fangirl and I love it, being in the fandom has brought me a lot of wonderful moments and enabled me to meet amazing people who have become friends. There\u2019s nothing quite like having a simultaneous meltdown with thousands of others because a trailer has just come out for the movie based upon one of your favorite books. Especially when you\u2019ve stayed up most of the night to see it. And you end up sobbing with everyone else because of all the perfection.This book, however, clearly has no idea of what it is to actually be in a fandom. It is not, as it tries to make us believe \u201cwriting fanfiction\u201d. Some of the fans do that, true, but being a fangirl certainly CANNOT be defined by writing fanfiction. Although I do read some, I tend to be very picky about it because no one ever comes close to writing as well as the author or staying perfectly canon and in character. So I prefer Alternate Universe fics because it allows more disgressions from the initial story and I'm more forgiving about it. That being said, for an author to write a book heavily featuring fanfiction and establishing that that\u2019s basically all the fangirls do\u2026 nope. Especially considering how Fangirl is written. The \u201cbook\u201d parts (as opposed to the \u201cFF\" parts) are still terrible. They read like fanfiction. And it\u2019s awful. 5. Don\u2019t even TOUCH meMoving on. Another huge problem in this book was the main character. Cath. Or Cather (seriously, how do you even pronounce that?)Never mind her being as na\u00efve as\u2026as\u2026 well, being super na\u00efve (the ridiculous metaphor Inspiration Gods are on vaycay apparently), I just couldn\u2019t stand her point of view on fanfiction. I know it\u2019s the point of the book but regardless, after the whole Mortal Instruments debacle and fanfiction readers generally being all \u201cYeah, this feels SO canon, it\u2019s like the author wrote it, OMG you\u2019re so talented\u201d I tend to balk whenever it comes up. Anyway. This just about killed me: \u201cShe didn\u2019t get it. She thought it was plagiarism\u201d [Cath, getting called out for submitting fanfiction as an assignment]It IS plagirism, you idiot. It's fine if you do it for your pleasure, but if you start submitting it for school assignments it can lead to other, despicable stuff, pretty fast. (I suggest you read about the Cassandra Clare debacle in case this isn't clear) 6. sobbing/flailing/screechingNow I'm rating this 1* because it annoyed me a lot but it's more of a 1.5* (how generous of me, right?)The second half of the book wasn\u2019t as bad. In fact, if the first part had been dropped along with any mention of Simon Snow, fanfiction and Nowhere-to-be-found-Nick, and only the second half had remained, I might have gone up to 2.5*. The romance part was really quite cute. It got ruined, however, by the numerous descriptions of *scratches head, tries to remember the name* Levi, and his \u201clong face\u201d, \u201cfeathery (I know, I know, bear with me) blonde hair\u201d and the general impression that he was so far from someone that would ever make me fangirl swoon, physically that I just couldn\u2019t ever add him to my Best Book Boyfriends list. But it was still cute and fluffy. And it explains why I finally decided to give Eleanor and Park a shot and I really liked that one. So. Not all is lost (except my brain cells and inner voice, who\u2019s been screaming in all caps ever since the first Simon Snow sentence) I guess.Anyway. I\u2019m off to fangirl some more (in the true sense of the word) about Catching Fire, \u2018Kthxbye!"}, {"userName": "Lauren", "userReviewDate": "Jan 10, 2013", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/4742594-lauren", "userReview": "And just like that, I'm finished.Now what?Dammit Rainbow, I'm going to be lost for the next week now, with no fictional boyfriend to curl up with at night.I'm sure in your internet travels, you've all seen the comic that says \"That moment when you finish a book, look around, and realise that everyone is just carrying on with their lives as though you didn't just experience emotional trauma at the hands of a paperback.\"That is me. Right now. At 1am.Lonely, and alone. With no Levi to cuddle up to.This is the third book to have this effect on me this year. First it was 'Anna and the French Kiss', and then it was 'Flat Out Love', and now 'Fangirl'. All of these books made me fall in love with their characters. Fangirl delivered all the awesome and addictive elements of a story that keep me coming back, that keep me up reading past midnight.I don't like to go into specific details when I review books, because I don't want to spoil things for those who haven't read it yet. Lets just say, that if you like reading YA novels, then this book should be at the top of your list. The characters will frustrate you with their flaws and their not always perfect relationships. They will make you proud of them as they stand up for what they want and believe in.

She notices how awkward she is and decides to befriend her. \n\u201cI feel sorry for you, and I'm going to be your friend.\"\"I don't want to be your friend,\" Cath said as sternly as she could. \"I like that we're not friends.\"\"Me, too. I'm sorry you ruined it by being so pathetic.\u201d\nCath doesn\u2019t have a lot of friends. But it\u2019s all good... she has the internet. \n\u201cMost of my friends went to other schools. Or their online.\u201d\u2028\u201cInternet friends don\u2019t count.\u201d\u2028\u201cWhy not?\u201d\n\nHer first day of college, along with meeting Reagan, she meets Levi. Levi is the most wonderful character! He is smitten with Cath. Friendly with everyone. That\u2019s just his thing. And he\u2019s always around. I adored Levi. He was one of the best characters. So kind, good hearted. I will read to him all day and night. \nCath spends the first semester of college making friends with Levi and Reagan, trying to deal with her twin sister pulling away from her, being separated from their father, and trying to figure out if she can write in the real world, make her own characters and her own way, while trying to keep up with her Simon Snow fan fiction. On top of all this, things with Levi start to progress from friendship to more... \nI know, I know, I\u2019ve already mentioned how much I love Levi, but I seriously adore this guy! Reasons I want a Levi:\u2028He works at StarbucksHe likes to be read toHe is nice to everyoneHe smiles all the timeHe thinks Cath's geekiness is endearing He is swoony and sweet <3\n\u201cWhat's the plan?' she asked.He grinned. 'My plan is to do things that make you want to hang out with me again tomorrow. What's your plan?''I'm going to try not to make an ass of myself.'He grinned. 'So we're all set.\u201d\u201cYou\u2019re beautiful,\u201d she said.\u201cThat\u2019s you.\u201d\u2028\u201cDon\u2019t argue with me. You\u2019re beautiful.\u201d\u201cCath couldn't stop thinking about Levi and his ten thousand smiles.\u201d\u201cI choose you over everyone.\u201d\nYou will fall in love with this book and these characters. There is so much I know I\u2019m leaving out... perfect coming of age story! READ READ READ! \n\n\u201cYou\u2019ve read the books?\u201d\u201cI\u2019ve seen the movies.\u201dCath rolled her eyes so hard, it hurt. (Actually.) (Maybe because she was still on the edge of tears. On the edge, period.) \u201cSo you haven\u2019t read the books.\u201d\u201cI\u2019m not really a book person.\u201d\u201cThat might be the most idiotic thing you\u2019ve ever said to me.\n\n\nI feel like this book was written just for me, and well... probably a lot of you reading this. For those of us who spend more time in a fictional world than the real world. Who talk to our \u2018internet friends\u2019 more than our \u2018real life\u2019 friends. I think most of us can relate to Cath in a big way, I know I did! Even though this book wasn\u2019t completely light, it kept me continuously smiling! The day I finished, I went right out and bought a hard copy to put on my shelf. LOVED IT!!! I\u2019m going to say- If you haven\u2019t read this one, you need to!!!"}, {"userName": "Komal Mikaelson", "userReviewDate": "May 13, 2013", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/7765903-komal-mikaelson", "userReview": "Edit: Downgrading the rating to 4. When I look back now, there are some minor issues, which I initially overlooked. So, yeah, maybe a 4.5 read but definitely not a 5.\nInitial Reaction After Completion\nYou know how we all cry at tragedies. We cry with Rose in Titanic, with Liesel in The Book Thief, with Harry in Shell Cottage, with Maya in Forbidden. We are a sentimental specie and we cry a damn lot.But how many of us cry at an especially beautiful ending. When wounds heal, when all loose ends are tied, when broken relationships are mended. I don't.I never cry at the happy stuff. Never. It's too mushy, wishy-washy for me.I mean what is there to cry about in something good? Tears don't get to show up in good times too. We see enough of them in the sad ones.But today was a first.I got teary-eyed at a happy ending. It was nothing too incredible or stunning or anything mind-blowing really. It was simple. And in that simplicity, it encompassed so much more than any grandiose ending could ever have. Because isn't life ultimately about the simple stuff?\nThe Plot\nFangirl follows the life of Cather as she muddles through her freshman year at college, with her social anxieties and this almost religious circumventing of any social interaction. But I wouldn't say she is closed off. It's just that she is much more comfortable with her glasses on, laptop in front of her, writing fanfiction. She writes fanfiction on Simon Snow series which is equivalent to our Harry Potter phenomenon and has a massive fan following. We follow one year of her life, the year before the release of the last book in the Simon Snow series.Now, I got into reading with Harry Potter and the Prisoner of Azkaban. Yep, the third book and with no idea whatsoever about the previous two installments. I had this heavy, hardbound copy which my mom used to read me to bed every night. And that marked the beginning of my HP obsession. I was in 6th grade when HP7 was to be released and had managed to find friend who was just as HP crazy as me. We used to squabble over who would end up with whom, will Harry-Hermione ever be possible, Snape-bitching, what will happen to Harry and all sorta shit. When I completed Deathly Hallows, a month, a WHOLE GODDAMN MONTH AFTER ITS RELEASE, for this one moment, before I started babbling over how Harry triumphed over Voldy, I was shocked. It was over. When something you grow up with comes to an end, it is scary and.. new and you don't know if you'll ever feel so much invested in something ever again.So, yes I'm rambling, reading through Cath's obsession and fangirl-ism was nostalgic and sad and delightful and relatable all at once.Conclusion, I may or not be wholly ruled by my emotions here. Wholly.\nCharacterization and other good stuff\nAs much biased as I am here, these is still something so refreshing about this book. The characterisation was amazing. Everyone, and I mean everyone was so real. They had their own quirks, separate qualities, distinct shortcomings. No one was wholly perfect or irredeemably bad. I adored them.The best part about the book is that it gives equal importance to all the relationships portrayed. Whether it was the father-daughter relationship between Art and Cath or the twins', Cath and Wren's development or Raegan's awkward and straight-forward friendship or the budding romance. Because it it so common in today's YA to erase all other people to make space for the luurrvvee interest. Rowell navigates this tricky area brilliantly.Now, I'll take a moment to talk about Cath and Wren's deal. I love love love love their relationship. It was so cute the way that they supported each other, wrote fanfiction together and were always there for each other. There were no unnecessary jealousies, petty rivalries or frivolous quibbles. As I said, refreshing.\nThe romance angle\nWe all are more than familiar with today\u2019s love interests. Their muscled body, ripped abs, broad shoulders and what the fuck not. To say Levi\u2019s descriptions were out of the norm would be an understatement. He has a receding hairline, soft muscled body and no towering 6 foot plus height. Levi had no scarred past or traumatic childhood; in fact he is one of the good guys, who have suddenly fallen out of the fad. You know the type, chivalrous, polite, a smile pasted on and being nice to strangers just because they can. They take a moment to read a bus driver\u2019s name and thank them. Peeta Mellark kinda guy.Because he is more than just the sexy love interest. First he is a nice person and then has more layers to him, which was so great to read about. Levi is outgoing, popular, the social kind which contrasted sharply with Cath's introversion. And they complemented each other perfectly.So, needless to say, what wasn't there to love about the guy?So, inspite of all Levi\u2019s swoon worthiness, if I talk about something that transcends even him, then you know, the book is good. More than good. Excellent.And now, I can't resist; I have to talk about Cath.\nCather Avery\nYou know about your siblings. How they annoy you at times, trouble you but you still manage to have loads of fun with them. How it is alright for you to bitch about them but no one else can say a word against them. How protective you are of them.That is exactly how I feel about Cath. She is hesitant to trust others, reluctant to make friends, but once you get to know her, you can't help but feel she is amazing. She is a geek. A nerd. A bookworm. And I loved that about her. I loved how strong she remains in crisis, how caring and supportive she is of her father, how protective she is of Wren.Her interactions with Raegan are hilarious.\n\n\u201cWhat\u2019s wrong with Levi?\u201d\u201cNothing,\u201d Cath said. \u201cHe\u2019s just \u2026 not like me.\u201d\u201cYou mean, smart?\u201d\u201cLevi\u2019s really smart,\u201d Cath said defensively.\u201cI know,\u201d Reagan said, just as defensively.\u201cHe\u2019s different,\u201d Cath said. \u201cHe\u2019s older. He smokes. And he drinks. And he\u2019s probably had sex. I mean, he looks like he has.\u201dReagan raised her eyebrows like Cath was talking crazy. And Cath thought\u2014not for the first time, but for the first time since last night\u2014that Levi had probably had sex with Reagan.\u201cAnd he likes to be outside,\u201d Cath said, just to change the subject. \u201cAnd he likes animals. We don\u2019t have anything in common.\u201d\u201cYou\u2019re making him sound like he\u2019s some rowdy mountain man who, like, smokes cigars and has sex with prostitutes.\u201d\n\nSo, wrapping up,\nThis is a do-not-miss-even-if-the-fucking-sky-is-falling. It is breezy and joyous coming of age novel which will undoubtedly tug at your heartstrings. Beneath all the fun and humor lie subtle hints to maturity and development. The honesty and innocence it emanates will lift your spirit and restore your faith in YA literature.\nI am leaving you with this absolutely stunning vignette of wisdom:\n\n\u201cI find Ugg boots really comforting,\u201d Cath said.\u201cWhy? Because they\u2019re warm?\u201d\u201cNo. Because they remind me that we live in a place where you can still get away with, even get excited about, Ugg boots. In fashionable places, you have to pretend that you\u2019re over them, or that you\u2019ve always hated them. But in Nebraska, you can still be happy about new Ugg boots. That\u2019s nice. There\u2019s no end of the innocence.\u201d"}, {"userName": "Ariel", "userReviewDate": "Aug 17, 2013", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/6536286-ariel", "userReview": "WELL. FANGIRL. IT\u2019S KIND OF A BIG DEAL RIGHT NOW. I read it, so let\u2019s talk about it!Things I liked:-\tThe examination of fanfiction as a type of literature-\tThe importance of family through sibling and parent relationships-\tThe importance of moving on and letting go (although I felt this plot point was drobbed and underdeveloped.. but the idea was there!)-\tAdorable adorable romance-\tShowing the reality of social awkwardness-\tThe alternate Harry Potter land-\tThat it made me pull almost an all-nighter finishing it-\tOVERALL: I thought this was a well written, cute story, with a cute romance that made me feel all bubbly, while still demonstrating some important transition from teen-to-adult lessonsThings I didn\u2019t like:-\tThe main character. I found her so closed to life. And I realize that the point was that she was going from closed off to more open.. but I never felt that transition. I found her extremely frustrating because of her inability to allow change and accept transition. I absolutely would not have minded if she found making changes DIFFICULT.. but she never even tried! She never went out of her comfort zone!-\tAnti-climactic moments: I felt that there was a lack of rise and falls in the story.. it felt a bit directionless and as though there were a few goals in the plot, I felt that they got dropped along the way for the romance.. what about the sister? The dad? The mom? Her classes? Her fanfic? Some of these technically got finished, but it just felt like they fell to the wayside of the romantic plot WHICH WAS LOVELY but still. But still.-\tOVERALL: My largest problem was the main character. When I read a story I like to sympathize/empathize with the main character and I really had a hard time with Cather.. I really didn\u2019t appreciate how closed off she was to new things!I absolutely understand why this is so popular right now, and I actually recommend it if the story sounds like something you might like, and I definitely had a fun time reading it.. but I read it as a cute contemporary and it didn\u2019t deliver too much more than that.

It's one of those \"cuddle up with a blanket\"-\"sip hot chocolate\"-\"feel good\"-books. There's not many books that can do this to me. I think this works so good for because Rainbow Rowell captured the kind of sadness and loneliness that also functions as an emotional wall between the protagonist and the outer world with such skillfulness that I immediately recognised this feeling. There's lots of novels that feature bookworms who'd rather live between the pages than in real life. But Rainbow Rowell is the first author who really had me believing.Apart from that, I can only compliment her on the characters and dialouges. Funny and sad, loving and romantic. Cath's life felt so real to me. Growing apart, doubting your life decisions, struggling to keep your head up. But also rediscovering your spirit, making new and fantastic experiences and learning that there's something beautiful in life for everyone.

They're\u00a0profound contributions to this world.\u201cThere was just no fear in her. No hesitation. Talking to Reagan was like standing in front of an oncoming train.\u201dHowever, since I already uploaded an extensive review full of ravishing ravings for Fangirl\u00a0in 2016 that you can check out here, I decided to twist things around for this reread and feature the list of everything important I noted during my reading experience (which I can visually represent with this very accurate gif below):\u2022 Starting with the most beloved cast of characters that always bring out the best feelings out of me, I made sure to take\u00a0my sweet time with this audiobook, listening to a little at a time every other week or so. More specifically, Levi has me wrapped around his finger; he leaves me grinning from ear to ear so easily. And I have to elaborate by making a whole new point about this...\u2022 I felt like Jim Halpert, smiling into the camera, because every time Levi shows, I'd inevitably look into a nonexistent\u00a0camera like I'm on The Office, while trying to hold off the wisp of a megawatt smile showing on my face. Like, get you a guy like Levi who goes out of his way in making sure you're comfortable and showing signs that he genuinely likes you.Just to give you a feel of what I'm talking about, here's a couple of instances that made me smile uncontrollably in his presence:\u2022 Walking with Cather late at night from the library to make sure she gets back safe and sound\u00a0to her dorm.\u201cJust Cather, huh?\u201d\u201cJust Cath.\u201d\u201cDid you get lost in the library?\u201d\u201cNo.\u201d\u201cI always get lost in the library,\u201d he said, \u201cno matter how many times I go. In fact, I think I get lost there more, the more that I go. Like it\u2019s getting to know me and revealing new passages.\u201d\u201cYou spend a lot of time in the library?\u201d\u201cI do, actually.\u201d\u201cHow is that possible when you\u2019re always in my room?\u201d\u201cWhere do you think I sleep?\u201d he asked. And when she looked at him, he was grinning.\u201dThis\u00a0loving, loyal sunflower has the biggest smile and an even bigger heart.Which is why I was beyond elated when I read Rainbow's comparing him to a golden retriever (\u201cFor the constant good-natured game of him.\u201d). Mainly because of a Youtube comment I shared in my\u00a0Parks and Rec tag that used exactly that phrase to describe the relationship unfolding between Andy Dwyer and April Ludgate:\u00a0It\u2019s like watching a grumpy cat and golden retriever get married. And it\u00a0represented a lot of what Cath and Levi's interaction held for me.\u2022 Plus, having them slowly bond over Cath's \u201csecret, dirty fanfiction\u201d is something that will never grow old on me. I'm utterly amazed at how effortlessly Rainbow captures that intimate moment of growth from being acquaintances to friends to something more.\u201cIt\u2019s not dirty.\u201d\u201cRead me some anyway.\u201dShe let go of the pillow; he\u2019d probably already filthed it beyond redemption.\u201cWhy?\u201d\u201cBecause I\u2019m curious,\u201d he said. \u201cAnd I like stories.\u201d\u201cYou just want to make fun of me.\u201d\u201cI won\u2019t,\u201d he said. \u201cI promise.\u201d\u201cThat\u2019s what you and Reagan do when I\u2019m not here, right? Make fun of me. Play with my commemorative busts. Do you have a stupid nickname for me?\u201dHis eyes sparkled. \u201cCather.\u201d\u201cI don\u2019t exist to amuse you, you know.\u201d\u201cOne, are you sure? Because you do. And, two, we don\u2019t make fun of you. Very much. Anymore. And, three\u2026\u201dHe was counting on his fingers, and his cheeks were twitching, and it was making Cath laugh.\u201cThree,\u201d he said, \u201cI won\u2019t make fun of you, to anyone but you, from now on, if you\u2019ll just once, right now, read me some of your fanfiction.\u201dI\u2019m blinking hearts.Pretty sure that with that Levi has ruined all other guys for me. I mean, having someone's defining feature be kindness above all is cathartic. It's like I always make sure to ask myself if the guy in front of me lives up to Levi\u2019s standards, and if he doesn't, well...\u2022 The peak, of course, hits with getting to experience my all-time favorite scene on audio, featuring Cath reading The Outsiders to Levi through the night. Any book that has the characters bond by reading a book out loud to one another is the way to my heart, all thanks to Fangirl being the primary instigator. I have to say, though, that listening to this part was so worth the wait, since\u00a0my eyes couldn't skip ahead out of anticipation as usual. I could actually\u00a0savor each line and unpack the hidden meaning within the words. I even listened to the ending with closed eyes, and it was so perfect because Cath was tired and her eyes were tired, and I felt it all.\u201cCath exhaled. Then inhaled. Her chest was so tight, it hurt both ways. Levi shouldn\u2019t get to make her feel this way\u2014he shouldn\u2019t even have access to her chest.\u201dThey had me going to bed with a smile on my face.\u00a0Madness...I'm pretty sure I can quote the whole book on Levi's sunny disposition if you'll let me, so this is as good a stopping point as any on that... I'll just end by mentioning that THEIR DOMESTIC SCENES TOGETHER ARE MY NICHE.\u00a0\u2022 The level of detail we're given about the characters hits the exact right spot for my nosy-self. Like, knowing that Reagan\u2019s voice sounds similar to Kathleen Turner's rasp\u00a0is *kisses fingers like a satisfied chef* perfect. Oh, and the random fact that the seatbelt in Levi's truck is a hassle to pull through is bliss to know.\u00a0It's these little things that make the characters seem that more real in the big picture.\u2022 Which leads me to discuss how much of a blast I had actually giving a listen to the Spotify playlists created by Rowell for both Cath and Levi.\u00a0Now, I can actually know what songs she had in mind during the most iconic of scenes, such as the infamous Emergency Dance Party.\u2022 It\u2019s frankly terrifying how much I get Cath. Every time I reread Fangirl, I either discover something new about myself or connect together pieces about myself through her. We have so many overlapping thoughts and actions, so I thought this was an incredibly well-done part of the story. I felt it most strongly the morning after the shared half-asleep kiss with Levi, when Cath tried to convince herself all the reasons they would never fit together.\u201cHe\u2019s different,\u201d Cath said. \u201cHe\u2019s older. He smokes. And he drinks. And he\u2019s probably had sex. I mean, he looks like he has.\u201dReagan raised her eyebrows like Cath was talking crazy. And Cath thought\u2014not for the first time, but for the first time since last night\u2014that Levi had probably had sex with Reagan.\u201cAnd he likes to be outside,\u201d Cath said, just to change the subject. \u201cAnd he likes animals. We don\u2019t have anything in common.\u201d\u201cYou\u2019re making him sound like he\u2019s some rowdy mountain man who, like, smokes cigars and has sex with prostitutes.\u201dCath laughed, despite herself. \u201cLike a dangerous French fur trapper.\u201d\u201cHe\u2019s just a guy,\u201d Reagan said. \u201cOf course he\u2019s different from you. You\u2019re never going to find a guy who\u2019s exactly like you\u2014first of all, because that guy never leaves his dorm room.\u2026\u201dThe last line is THE STRONGEST THING I'VE FELT IN MY LIFE. I'm beyond thankful that Cath has someone like Reagan to set her straight. Their blossoming friendship was one of the most unexpected to appear with their juxtaposing personalities, and yet it grew to be one of my favorite friendships to read. I was thunderstruck time and again by their casual daily interactions that brought about some of the most memorable lines of the book.\u2022 Speaking of, the amount of times I had to pause the audiobook to release my pent-up laughter just goes to show how utterly brilliant Rowell is at creating incomparable\u00a0comical moments at the most unexpected times. I'll be still laughing minutes after I read a certain phrase because it's on a loop in my head. Like, I never get over this particular line Levi throws at Cath the first time they hang out in his room/attic:\u201cRead something else,\u201d he whispered, kissing the skin below her ear.Cath took a deep breath. \u201cWhat?\u201d\u201cAnything. More fanfiction, the soybean report\u00a0\u2026 You\u2019re like a tiger who loves Brahms\u2014as long as you\u2019re reading, you let me touch you.\u201dThe \u201cthe soybean report\u201d got me good. I'm so keen on knowing HOW Rainbow comes up with this stuff... What follows afterward between Cath and Levi is, of course, one of the best scenes for them as a couple, but I won't bombard you with more, since I'm obviously a complete fool when it comes to these two together. (And it's impossible to choose just one moment to capture.)With having read all of Rowell's books (some even multiple times) I just have to say that she excels at making us EXPERIENCE a story instead of merely reading words.\u00a0Fangirl\u00a0explores the subtle real-life moments of young adulthood that are often forgotten about, and it makes her writing endlessly readable.See you in my next reread of this book!\nNote: I\u2019m an Amazon Affiliate.

It seemed that it was going to do something new with a protagonist that wasn\u2019t the typical quirky teen girl.Here\u2019s where I stop and give my short review before delving into a much-needed rant: The protagonist, Cath, is a wholly passive character who gets exactly what she wants with no effort. There\u2019s a dreamy love interest who makes Prince Charming look like an inconsiderate jerk. Anyone who disagrees with Cath is awful. This book very much needed an editor, because even Mary Sue is side eying Cath and saying, Really? There are a lot of problems with this book.But none of them are quiet so amusing and creepy as The Scene. The Scene reads like a rejected outtake from Fifty Shades of Grey (which I haven\u2019t read, other than the super snarky blog posts of some of the more hilarious excerpts). That in and of itself is kind of appropriate, because Fangirl is about fan fiction and Fifty Shades of Grey is Twilight fan fiction with names changed.I should preface my description of The Scene with some background: the protagonist, Cath, is emotionally stunted and almost assuredly has some mental issues. That part of the book works beautifully: Ms. Rowell\u2019s ability to capture Cath\u2019s social phobias was one of the strongest parts of the book. Cath is painfully shy and awkward, not in a cute way, but in a painfully brutal way that makes ordinary social interactions uncomfortable.That part is good. No complaints there.What makes the love angle weird is that Cath has the emotional maturity of a 13-year-old girl. In comparison, her dreamy boy toy reads as a guy in his mid- to late-twenties. Which leaves readers with a love scene between one character who reads like she\u2019s in junior high and another character who reads like he\u2019s pushing, at the very least, 30.Eat your heart out, Nabokov.The Scene itself is about our almost lovers attempting to overcome the girl\u2019s phobias about a physical relationship (WHICH IS EXPECTED, BECAUSE SHE\u2019S 13). To make her comfortable, her Prince Charming suggests she read a slash (homosexual) fan fiction she wrote about two characters from a best-selling children\u2019s book series (the fictional versions of Harry Potter and Draco Malfoy). That\u2019s right. The big romantic scene features a virginal straight girl reading her boyfriend a gay love story that she wrote about characters from a children\u2019s book.Look, I\u2019m all about different strokes for different folks. As long as everyone\u2019s consented and is capable of giving said consent, have whatever sort of kinky fun you want. But.I doubt most readers would find the reverse of this sexy. If the guy said \u201chey, sweetheart, I have issues with getting my motor revving and the only way to fix that will be if you and I look at a bunch of naked photos I took of two straight girls pretending to be lesbians,\u201d I think the reaction would be outrage rather than \u201cOMG So Hot and Understanding.\u201dBut \u2013 and this is really the major point \u2013 it wasn\u2019t sexy. It was creepy and weird and not good creepy and weird. Cath has the maturity level of a preteen, which worked at the beginning of the book, but she doesn\u2019t mature at all over the course of the novel. Having a twenty-something guy seduce her? No thanks.Said scene isn\u2019t helped by the fact that readers are given no understanding as to why Mr. Perfect is attracted to Cath. The only reason I could come up with is that Mr. Perfect is an odd dude who has a thing about the conquest of really virginal girls. No other reason is provided to explain his attraction. She\u2019s just kind of there, and he\u2019s just kind of there, and she\u2019s mean to him, and she reads him her fan fiction and he loves it because, duh, she\u2019s that amazing. She shows no interest in his life whatsoever and apparently that translates into him being crazy about her.I mean, put like that, he sounds like he has some deep-seated issues of his own, what with being attracted to women who treat him horribly. After taking a break to distance myself from feeling that I had just read something that veered way too close to erotica involving a minor, I started reading again.I wish I hadn\u2019t. Over the last part of the book, the plot, already not great, takes a nosedive. Cath is way too passive throughout the book, but her passivity reaches epic levels towards the end, and the take-away message seems to be that \u201ccoming of age\u201d means everyone doing exactly what Cath wants and having everyone stay at the maturity level of junior high, only with sex. I like coming-of-age books because, done well, they resonate and tap into a plethora of emotions. Even the middle-of-the-road stuff is engaging. But there is nothing here to warrant a \u201ccoming of age\u201d tag. Nothing. Cath doesn\u2019t grow at all. The few times when she\u2019s challenged, she never has to stand up for herself because someone else rides in to save the day. Sure, she has some family issues that suck, but who doesn\u2019t? Plus, those family issues are within her comfort zone. She\u2019s dealt with them for years, and she knows the drill. Whenever she\u2019s challenged outside of her comfort zone, someone else swoops in and saves her. She\u2019s never held accountable or forced to stand up for herself. It\u2019s an anti-coming of age story.Also, as someone who spent most of my freshman year of college hiding my childhood obsession with all things Star Trek, I hated how the \u201cnerdy fangirl\u201d was treated here. Granted, I never wrote Star Trek fan fiction and went to all of one convention, but the way Fangirl tackles the topic lacks any and all finesse. That Cath\u2019s twin sister wanted to make a break from their shared childhood hobbies and interests doesn\u2019t make her a bad person, although that's the lesson here. I know a lot of people who struggled with reconciling who they were in high school with who they wanted to be in college, whether it was science fiction and fantasy, religion, or hair color. That's normal! It\u2019s part of growing up: trying on different personas and finding what works and what doesn\u2019t and what is a childhood obsession and what may turn into a lifelong obsession. Given the blurb on the jacket flap, that\u2019s what I expected here. Nope.Frankly, a book from Cath\u2019s sister\u2019s perspective would have been loads more interesting than Cath\u2019s trapped-in-the-past-and-everyone-else-is-awful-because-they-want-me-to-grow-up neuroses.I was excited to see a book out there about fangirls that claimed to not treat them as pathetic punch lines. I guess I was sort of expecting something like Galaxy Quest (which, incidentally, was just voted a better Star Trek movie than some actual Star Trek movies \u2013 how amazing is that?).But Fangirl is almost worse than outright mocking. I liked seeing a \u2018traditional\u2019 author opting for a sympathetic portrayal of fan fiction. I view fan fiction as the literary equivalent of fantasy football, and I\u2019m baffled by the bizarre stigma attached to it. Spend fourteen hours every Sunday from September to January glued to a TV watching men give each permanent brain damage and that\u2019s acceptable (says the sports fan). For that matter, go see the studio-sanctioned JJ Abrams fan fiction of Star Trek and that\u2019s hip (which is awful, because Abrams\u2019 version is nothing more than a crappy, dumb-as-nails Explode-o-rama in space). Those are fine. But a written-for-free story about Harry Potter? The horrors!Honestly, Fangirl, rather than celebrating the creativity of fans, simply affirms the \u2018weirdness\u2019 of the hobby.To that end, the fiction class subplot was awful. Just awful. I get it. Cath is a special snowflake who can do no wrong. Based on her experience writing fan fiction, she is a perfect author in need of no correction. She\u2019s learned it all and should probably be teaching fiction writing, because she\u2019s that amazing.Sure she is.The one thing I can usually rely on in novels is that writers know about writing and the world of writing (to be fair to Ms. Rowell: she does have a few good paragraphs about getting into the zone). It\u2019s therefore weird to read a novel that features such an unrealistic portrayal of creative writing.Working in a creative field entails dealing with criticism and rejection. Criticism is painful, but it is pain with a purpose. It takes people with raw talent and potential and forces them to improve. I live in LA, and more than once have heard people use \u201cSo what\u2019s the worst review you\u2019ve ever had?\u201d as an icebreaker. As a way to get to know someone, it sounds awful, but I\u2019m amazed at how well it works. Because everyone has that story. Most have multiple stories, because it\u2019s a normal part of the job. As a film professor once told me, none of his students would improve if he told them nothing more than \u201cgood job\u201d and \u201cyou\u2019re so talented.\u201dBut that\u2019s all Cath hears. Because Cath is perfect. Except her mean old professor doesn\u2019t like fan fiction and doesn\u2019t want Cath turning in fan fiction for assignments. How dare she. Because Cath is flawless. She needs no critiquing. Any piece of work she touches is brilliant.In other words, the Simon Snow series is not the biggest fantasy featured in Fangirl. NOT recommended."}, {"userName": "Lola  Reviewer", "userReviewDate": "Jan 19, 2016", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/14596170-lola-reviewer", "userReview": "CARRY ON AND FANGIRL ALL OVER THIS BOOK.Oh my freaking god. How crazy is it that I now feel like starting a new blog and loosing myself in my own written virtual universe? Ha, I definitely don\u2019t have time for that, but Cather is one inspiring girl. The word \u2018\u2018fanfiction\u2019\u2019 is not one I am unfamiliar with. I know what it means, how it works and what kind of effect it has on people. I\u2019ve just never been a \u2018\u2018fan\u2019\u2019 of it myself. I like original pieces of work, and if I don\u2019t in fact like a story, I don\u2019t feel invested enough to seek alternate versions. I\u2019m glad fanfiction exists, though, I\u2019m all for never-ending stories and self-expression. I\u2019m not saying you won\u2019t ever see me read one (I\u2019m dying to get my hands on The Student Prince), but the writer needs to change A LOT of elements for me to consider even glancing at it. Is that strange? Maybe, maybe not.None the less, and quite to my surprise, I LOVED Simon and Baz. Probably because\u2026 Hey, I knew they came straight out of the Harry Potter series, but the author changing physical features, names and even personality traits, helped me in forgetting that piece of information and just focus on the new story she provided us with. Plus I love gay romance. You know how sometimes you read a contemporary story and you can compare what happens in the novel to things that have happened to you in the past or to someone you know? Well, Fangirl did not make me feel like that. It\u2019s not necessarily a bad thing\u2026 but, to me, it has more of a fairy tale feeling to it than anything else. I could connect with Cather\u2019s obsession for Simon and Baz, since I have my own LGBT coupleSSSS to obsess over (Damen and Laurent, Alec and Magnus, etc). Of course, the parts related to her mother are not wonderful but sad, except they\u2019re also inconclusive. Like, will she keep growing up without a mother? Cather is a heroine very easily likeable. I mean, what\u2019s not to like?  The girl is a book addict (just like many of us), writes, gets straight A\u2019s and doesn\u2019t go on partying and drinking every night. It\u2019s funny how she thinks she and her twin sister Wren are alike, since Wren is exactly the opposite of her and I felt how different they were when reading the story. She has her charm, though. I wish we\u2019d gotten more of Reagan. She\u2019s there\u2026 but not exactly there. She comes and goes, has only Tweet-long conversations with Cather and honestly doesn\u2019t seem that much interested in her, so I was surprised when Cather admitted to been Reagan\u2019s best girl friend. Levi is adorable. If he could an object, he would be a Teddy Bear for everyone to hug!As for the writing, daaamn\u2026 I have had a forthy-page taste of Rainbow Rowell\u2019s writing in My True Love Gave to Me: Twelve Holiday Stories, and sadly so, I was disappointed by her Holiday story and strongly thought that this author might not be for me after all. So imagine my shock when I was completely entranced by her writing in Fangirl.

If you're a writer or an introvert, I can almost (practically) guarantee at some point this book is going to hit you in a very relatable way.  I was so emotionally invested in this book. Gosh. Look at me. I'm a fangirling (ha, pun) mess. I can't even write a logical review!  I seriously just love this book so much.  I really connected to the characters!  Can we just talk about Cath for a moment? She has a social anxiety disorder and (knowing from experience) it is written so DANG WELL, I nearly cried. Cath didn't find the cafeteria in her dorm for 3 weeks because she was too scared. She lived off peanut butter and protein bars. That's totally something I would do. (Says she who has emergency peanut butter in her room.) All of Cath's quirks and introverted ways...I just related to, so this made the book hugely special to me. I felt like the author had written it FOR me, which is awesome. Thanks Rainbow Rowell, me old pal. (Har, har.) Oh, yeah, there were other characters besides Cath. Duh.  SO. I have to mention Cath's identical twin first: Wren. (Yes, their names are \"Cather\" and \"Wren\"...their mother wasn't expecting twins.) Wren made me angry. I understood that she was flexing wings and needed to try \"life without her sister\". But, as Levi ends up mentioning, it's like Wren \"broke up\" with Cath. It's sad. You can't just dump someone when you want to look for other options. And they're sisters! Cath is an introvert dumped in a scary new college...Wren, let me hit you with a book.  Wren made me angry the whole time, but she was very well written as a character. (An annoying character).  Levi was kind of adorable.  I loved him a lot...although, yeah, *squints eyes suspiciously at Levi* He had issues.  I don't actually see this as a love-triangle at all.  While there are potentially two love-interests, I think it handles like real life and not like a triangle where two random guys are vying for the \"invisible\" girl's affections (which, let's face it, is very unlikely). That saying, also: I HATE NICK.  Reagan was brilliant!  I'm totally in awe of how she was written....she was perfectly mean and sweet all at once. Plot?  Weeell, to be honest, I got to 50% and asked my sister (who'd already read this) \"What the heck are they going to do for the rest of the book?1\" They sure found plenty to do, though, even if it isn't breakneck speed or mind numbing suspense.  The entire book is hugely addictive.  I could NOT put it down.  Writing?  Beautiful. I admit to not being the biggest fan of  Eleanor and Park , but I love Rainbow Rowell's style. It's amazing. Addictive. Clear. Oh, and concise! And I love it how she writes about issues close to home. Nothing is unrealistic or unreal about her books. I love how she weaves her characters' relationships in and out until they're just as complicated as in the real world. Okay! Okay! I'll stop gushing. But seriously: introverts, this is a story written specifically for you. I haven't been so invested in a book since the beginning of the year. I just...yeah. Brilliant. I'm so glad my sister is reviewing this on the blog, though, because I'm an incoherent babbly fangirling mess. I LOVED THIS BOOK."}, {"userName": "April (Aprilius Maximus)", "userReviewDate": "Sep 28, 2013", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/20658145-april-aprilius-maximus", "userReview": "First read November 2013Reread October 2015I definitely changed my opinions on this book after reading it a second time, so here's a little updated review!Back in 2013, I read and reviewed 'Fangirl', and since then I've read it again only to find my thoughts and opinions have changed.When I first read the book, I remember being so frustrated with Cath for throwing away her University degree by not doing her assignments because she didn't feel like it. But it wasn't because she didn't feel like it, it's because she actually COULDN'T do it. I get it now, because I recently went through something similar where my anxiety got so out of control that I literally couldn't do anything, let alone assignments. So I totally get it now that I've truly been in Cath's shoes! She's such a relatable character for so many people and I love Rainbow Rowell so much for creating her and sharing her with us!Another thing that changed from my original review was the fandom aspect. This time around, I found myself skimming the Simon Snow excerpts, and even in some cases, skipping them entirely. I was just so invested in what was happening in the real world with Cath and Levi and all of their friends/families that I didn't care about Simon, to be honest. And all of the Simon Snow bits were taken from all over the place (the original series, Cath's fanfiction, etc.), and I think it would have worked better if Rowell had just sticked with ONE Simon Snow story, instead of all of them combined. Other than that, I really enjoyed the story in its entirety. It was cute and fluffy with just the right amount of drama, and the characters were all really well rounded. The family aspect was spot on and the romance was SO cute.Originally I rated it 4 stars, and even though I don't have the same issues with the book, I found other problems with the book so I can't really raise my rating. I still give it 4 stars and still definitely recommend it!Original review:Caution: Spoilers ahead. Read at your own risk.I went into this book with such high expectations that it fell flat a tiny bit for me in terms of the storyline and the main character. The premise was so exciting to me that I just knew I was going to love it, and don\u2019t get me wrong, I definitely really liked it, but it just wasn\u2019t a 5 star book for me. Here\u2019s why:Because everyone has been raving about this book like there\u2019s no tomorrow, I was expecting more from the storyline. I was expecting something big to happen or a massive problem or a shocking revelation but I almost felt like nothing really happened. It was so promising for me up until the end, and I mean, sure, Cath\u2019s sister ended up in hospital but then everything quickly turned fine and dandy. I was just expecting a huge plot twist or a massive emotional ending. Unfortunately, I did not get either of these things. The other thing that made me take off a star was the main character, Cath. Yes, most of the time I could really relate to her but sometimes I just wanted to shake her and ask her, \u201cWhat the hell are you doing? Pull yourself together!\u201d If you\u2019re in college or university, you don\u2019t just not do your assignments. That shit has to get done or you\u2019re wasting a hell of a lot of money for nothing just because you don\u2019t feel like doing it. That annoyed me. I just didn\u2019t get why she was being a whiny, selfish, annoying character sometimes, but most of the time, I really did like her character.Okay, moving on to the good things:I LOVED the fandom aspect to this and the fact that it was extremely similar to Harry Potter. I also don\u2019t know if I\u2019m looking to much into it, but I felt like Simon and the Humdrum, being two parts of one person (one good and one evil) could relate to Cath and Wren and how different they are, and that one doesn\u2019t exist without the other, you know? I don\u2019t know if that makes any sense. Anyway, I loved Regan and Levi, they were just the best characters and I just loved Regan\u2019s attitude and Levi\u2019s happy vibe that just made you giggle a little (okay, a lot!) They were really well done.I love how deeply the family aspects ran through this story. You know how you read a book and sometimes the characters parents just kind of disappear? Yeah, I love how that didn\u2019t happen in this story. Family was very prominent and I really appreciated that. In fact, almost all of the characters had families that were mentioned now that I think about it.Overall, I really did enjoy this book but there were just a few things that ticked me off a bit. But I definitely still recommend it if you\u2019re in the mood for a good contemporary about fandoms!!My Rating: \u2605\u2605\u2605\u2605\u2606"}, {"userName": "Susanne ", "userReviewDate": "Sep 15, 2013", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/7179798-susanne", "userReview": "Fangirl had quality.

It's both a coming of age story about a girl starting a new life in college, as well as a friend to lovers story. From the moment I started reading it, Rainbow Rowell managed to suck me into the world of Cath, Levi, Simon Snow and all the other equally unique side characters. The author's easyflowing writing style made it seem as a very simple story at the time I was reading it, but looking back at it as a whole the story managed to convey a very true and important message about life, love and friendship. \u2666 \nCath\n \u2666\n\"I don't trust anybody. Not anybody. And the more I care about somebody, the more I am sure they're going to get tired of me and take off.\"\nEighteen year old Cath and her twin sister Wren have close their entire life. Although they are very different, with Cath being shy, introvert and little socially awkward and Wren being the exact opposite, they have always had one passion in common: reading, re-reading and obsessing over Simon Snow stories. \n\n\"Loving Simon isn't something someone does alone or once a year at a convention - for thousands of fans of all ages, loving Simon Snow is nothing less than a life style.\"\n\nNow, when the sisters start college, Wren is ready to move on from her Simon Snow obsession and start a new adventure. She's convinced they need to meet new people and decides it's best they not room together. Cath, on the other hand, remains a die hard Simon Snow fan. She much rather spends her time with fictional characters and internet friends than venturing herself in the unknown college world. But college and the new people she meets also make her realize there might be more to life than being solely focused on everything Simon. \u2666 \nLevi\n \u2666\n\"You give away nice like it doesn't cost you anything.\u201d\nAt first, Cath is adverse to getting to know Levi, or any other new person for that matter. She's content just to live in her own protectieve bubble, while reading and writing about her number one passion: Simon Snow. As a very popular fanfiction writer, Cath has thousands of followers on the internet who anxiously await her newest fanfiction entries. She spends almost all of her free time locked up in her room, typing behind her computer. Her new roommate Raegan feels sorry for her and decides to become her friend and forces her to go out more.\n\u201cI feel sorry for you, and I'm going to be your friend.\"\"I don't want to be your friend,\" Cath said as sternly as she could. \"I like that we're not friends.\"\"Me, too. I'm sorry you ruined it by being so pathetic.\u201d \nAt the same time Cath starts to spend more and more time with the always smiling and helpful, not to mention very goodlooking, Levi. During the first half of the book Cath assumes Levi is Raegan's boyfriend since he spends so much time in their room. But after she finds out they've been broken up for over three years, she allows herself to acknowledge the feelings she has for him. Levi thinks her Simon obsession is adoringly cute and he supports her writing but he also makes her want to push her boundaries and experience the real college life.\n\u201cWhat's the plan?' she asked.He grinned. 'My plan is to do things that make you want to hang out with me again tomorrow. What's your plan?''I'm going to try not to make an ass of myself.'He grinned. 'So we're all set.\u201d \nCath is an easy to relate to character and her geekiness makes her all the more unique and fun to read about, while Levi is the perfect, sweet and swoonworthy male lead. Their romance was slow building and adoringly awkward at times which made me all the more curious to find out how their relationship would develop. In the end, it was especially Levi's understanding and kind personality that made me root for their happily ever after. \n\u201cIt's okay if you're crazy,\" he said softly. \"You don't even know-\"\"I don't have to know,\" he said. \"I'm rooting for you.\u201d \u2665~*~*~*~*~*~*~*~*~*~*~*~*~*~*~*~*~*~*~*~*~*~*~*~*~*~All in all, Fangirl was a highly surprising read that will definitely stay with me for a very long time. It's not the kind of story that will blow you away with sexy scenes or dramafilled situations; on the contrary, it's more the kind of story that will blow you away with its simplicity and meaningful conversations. It was my first book by this author and I'm already looking forward to reading more of her work in the future!If you're looking for a refreshing standalone novel that will leave you with a happy smile after you've finished reading it, Fangirl is the perfect book for you!"}, {"userName": "Maria", "userReviewDate": "Apr 07, 2018", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/77602709-maria", "userReview": "4.2/5 Stars \u2b50\ufe0f \u2b50\ufe0f \u2b50\ufe0f \u2b50\ufe0f \u201cTo really be a nerd, she'd decided, you had to prefer fictional worlds to the real one.\u201d \u2015 Rainbow Rowell, Fangirl I honestly adored this book. I adored the complex characters, the fandom aspect, the writing, the setting, the romance. This book was a true delight. I got a bit confused, at first, with the narration of this book being in third person, while most books of this genre are written in first person, but fan fics are always written in third person. I hope Rainbow did this on purpose, as she said in her interview at the end of my copy of the book that she read lots of fanfics before writing this book. Fingers crossed.We start off with Cath. A character with social anxiety, a fangirl, a writer, a loner, a character which at the beginning of the book was exactly like I was at her age. And then progressed as a person, made friends, got a boyfriend all that with keeping her true identity as a fangirl. Something I did, too. I feel like the author kind of forgot about Cath's social anxiety after the middle of the book. I don't know if it was intentional. It probably was. But you don't just get rid of social anxiety like that. It gets better but it's an on going battle.I have been a fangirl all my life. Even before I knew about fandom. I discovered the concept of fandoms in 2012 when I made my Tumblr blog. Fanfics, GIFs, fan arts, OTPs e.t.c. have been a part of me. I have had a very successful blog on Tumblr, been making GIFs for years for multiple fandoms I have loved and have always been keeping it a secret. Just as Cath did with her fan fiction persona. I so related to that I wanted to scream. And like Cath, after years, I found the right people to share my blog with, my love for fandoms, this world that was always been for myself and people online that I knew. And I'm so glad we both found people who didn't judge us for this, joined us or didn't understand it but are always there for us. And it makes me even prouder to be a geek than I was before.We're moving on to Simon Snow. A hymn to Harry Potter and J. K. Rowling and Hogwarts. The books and movie series the sisters were in love with since always. Something I related to so much too. I think if I read the book back then when it first got published I would relate to it even more. It was the start of my fandom life and now I have grown a tiny bit out of it because of how life is and I was head on invested in everything back then. I'm still in fandom, but a tiny bit from afar now. I still make GIFs though and read fics.I think Baz was supposed to be Draco. Call me stupid if I didn't find that obvious but it came to me after a while. Like how Baz called Simon \"Snow\" and not Simon. Like Draco called Harry \"Potter\". Or how Simon was trying to discover something sneaky Baz was doing and had an obsession with him. Like Harry in book six with Draco. I had never shipped Drarry but I totally ship Simon and Baz. Rainbow made them their own characters and the world her own. It wasn't just Harry Potter but it was inspired by it and it became something more. That's why the author continued and made a whole book out of this world. Cause it felt so much more special.Now let's talk about some real life important issues the author tackled. Social anxiety, bi polar depression and alcoholism. I can't exactly say she handled them amazingly but I'm glad she added them. She didn't make her novel a flat out fluffy contemporary romance about a girl who likes a book series, writes fan fiction and is going off to college to new adventures. She added depth and I think the book would be much less without those aspects. And now... *drum roll* THE ROMANCE. THE FUCKING ROMANCE. I WANT A LEVI. CAN SOMEONE BUY ME A LEVI? At first I shipped Cath and Nick. Like come on, you all did. Before he became a massive bitch ass fuckward. He was nice and they were both writers who worked together on a piece and that's only what united them. I didn't feel a spark between them or anything but it was the safest thing to ship. I always have to ship something guys, I'M A FANGIRL GODDAMMIT. And then... LEVI. Reagan's \"boyfriend\" out of many. The always smiling Levi who lets Cath read him fanfiction and get invested in her world. This little puppy who fell in love but didn't know what to do about it. I just loved him so fucking much. YOU GO GIRL! I loved the humor of this book too. Some one liners were hilarious. Their dad was hilarious. FUCKING KELLY. (Also why so many names in this book that are mostly used for men used for women I always got confused). I remember this line that I laughed so hard about for some reason \"Are you Cody or are you Zack?\". Definitely Cath is Cody and Zack is Wren. And Cody was always my favorite. Also, the most amazing reference to the Harry Potter movies. When Cath, Wren and their dad were watching the fourth installment of Simon Snow and Cath was thinking \"All the boys had longer hair in this one.\" I FUCKING LOST IT. Everyone had longer, ugly fucking hair in Goblet of Fire for some reason no one will ever understand.This book made me hate and love characters with a burning passion. And I always love to do that. Love list:CathLeviReaganTheir dadThe professorHate list: Fuckward NickWrenTheir absent motherAbelYes, Wren is on the hate list. Her \"redemption\" at the end didn't convince me. I hated the way she treated Cath like everything was her fault, like she had to be like her to live a good 18 year old college life. You'd expect Reagan to be the hated character but she wasn't. She was loyal and a good friend to Cath, despite her harsh tone sometimes. But Wren was selfish and only wanted to live her life despite everything. And then she got a huge ass slap in the face. I so wanted their dad to not let her finish school but it wasn't going to happen.To conclude everything, I think this book was solid. It did some things wrong but it did most things right. I will read \"Carry on\" next to delve into the world of Simon and Baz. I'm really excited about this, to be honest. An alternative version of Harry Potter, the fucking King \ud83d\udc51 of books, is always something I love to read.

She and her twin sister, Wren, ensconced themselves in the Simon Snow series when they were just kids; it\u2019s what got them through their mother leaving. Reading. Rereading. Hanging out in Simon Snow forums, writing Simon Snow fan fiction, dressing up like the characters for every movie premiere.Cath\u2019s sister has mostly grown away from fandom, but Cath can\u2019t let go. She doesn\u2019t want to.Now that they\u2019re going to college, Wren has told Cath she doesn\u2019t want to be roommates. Cath is on her own, completely outside of her comfort zone. She\u2019s got a surly roommate with a charming, always-around boyfriend, a fiction-writing professor who thinks fan fiction is the end of the civilized world, a handsome classmate who only wants to talk about words... And she can\u2019t stop worrying about her dad, who\u2019s loving and fragile and has never really been alone.For Cath, the question is: Can she do this? Can she make it without Wren holding her hand? Is she ready to start living her own life? Writing her own stories?And does she even want to move on if it means leaving Simon Snow behind?", "title": "Fangirl", "url": "http://www.goodreads.com/book/show/16068905-fangirl", "average": 4.1, "cover": "https://images.gr-assets.com/books/1355886270l/16068905.jpg", "reviews": 42700, "authors": [{"url": "https://www.goodreads.com/author/show/4208569.Rainbow_Rowell", "name": "Rainbow Rowell"}], "type": ["Young Adult", "Contemporary", "Romance", "Fiction"], "outlinks": ["http://www.goodreads.com/book/show/16068905-fangirl", "http://www.goodreads.com/book/show/17286849-fangirl", "http://www.goodreads.com/book/show/19174917-fangirl", "http://www.goodreads.com/book/show/22369653-fangirl", "http://www.goodreads.com/book/show/23395098-fangirl", "http://www.goodreads.com/book/show/15745753-eleanor-park", "http://www.goodreads.com/book/show/8909152-attachments", "http://www.goodreads.com/book/show/18081809-landline", "http://www.goodreads.com/book/show/32768522-carry-on", "http://www.goodreads.com/book/show/26365537-kindred-spirits"]}
