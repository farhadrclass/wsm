Yes, you've been exposed. Because how could anyone be unaffected by such injustice and cruelty toward a fourteen-year-old?Julian\u2019s parents died when he was a child, leaving him with a foster care family for some time, and then with his uncle Russell, who has been abusing him both mentally and physically since.Unfortunately, like other victims of abuse, Julian doesn\u2019t understand that what he\u2019s experiencing at home is not normal, so he doesn\u2019t know he needs help. Though his friendship with Adam does make him question some of his uncle\u2019s actions and ways of thinking, such as why he insists on Julian shaving his legs. Julian and Adam may be four years apart in age, but that doesn\u2019t keep them from being able to connect to one another on a meaningful level \u2013 so meaningful that it made me realize that friendships between two young men are rarely so thoroughly explored in YA contemporary, without going in the romantic direction. It\u2019s beautifully-touching and never manipulative. The author doesn\u2019t seek to control our reactions, but of course being the decent human beings that we are, we quickly notice that Russell has deep-rooted issues that only hurt Julian and prevent him from living a good life. I can\u2019t believe it took me so long to give this one a chance, especially since I read it in a single day. I was afraid it would be too dark, but while Robin Roe does include scenes that are hard to witness, her goal isn\u2019t to overwhelm us to the point of not being able to read this book either.

I figured he wasn't eating in the hospital because as long as he STAYED in the hospital, he was \"safe\"...but then when he found out he'd go home with Adam, he tried harder. But I do wish it'd discussed if the eating disorder stayed or what Julian's thought process about it was. Things like that.

You will hate his guts if you read this wonderful book and find out what all he puts Julian through. I CAN'T EVEN, PEOPLE!!!!!!!!!!!!!! The book is told through Julian and Adam. It's not confusing just their different thoughts as they are the main characters. When Julian was young he lived with Adam for awhile until the evil uncle claimed him. Adam's mom tried to keep him but, you know how that goes. Anyway, they are in high school together. Adam is about to graduate and go on to college with his friends. Julian is younger and just getting by in school. I really loved Adam's friends too. All of the main ones were super nice. Charlie with his anger issues was my favorite but when you read him, you will know what I mean. And when they all took Julian in as a friend and were so nice to him (even the ones that acted like a butt to him at first) it made me feel all mushy inside.

Spoilers ahead?? !TRIGGER WARNING: Child abuseA List of Cages is about two teenagers, Julian and Adam who were once foster brothers, but then Julian is taken into custody by an uncle he never knew he had. Ever since, his life is a living fucking hell. Julian's beaten, whipped, isolated and terrified of everything. It was absolutely horrible and heartbreaking to read about this innocent fourteen year old boy being treated like this. Julian is one of the most sweetest, innocent, and forgiving characters ever. He's one of those people I would like to hug and feed vanilla ice cream with sprinkles on top to everyday !!!! Julian has been through so much a kid his age or anyone's age shouldn't have to go through AT ALL. And reading about his life made me cry so much because no one deserves what he went through. I loved him.Adam is such an amazing character as well. He was so friendly and lovable towards Julian. He's so caring, lovable, and kind towards everyone. (Except for Julian's asshole uncle which I totally understand.) Also, his ADHD was dealt with absolutely brilliantly. Though I enjoyed reading from his POV, I looked forward to Julians' POV's more. We seriously need more positive sibling relationships in YA books. The one in this book is one of the freaking best EVER. Like, I'm seriously crying over Adam and Julian's relationship. They love and care for each other so much and they are always there for each other. It's just so beautiful, my God.Overall, if you're still having doubts about reading this, hit me up and I'll be there to throw this book in your face."}, {"userName": "Larry H", "userReviewDate": "Nov 28, 2016", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/5872506-larry-h", "userReview": "I'd rate this 4.5 stars.This book is at times harrowing and heartbreaking, at times hopeful. But what adds to this book's power is the fact that its plot isn't fantasy, and there are children dealing with these issues every day.Life changed for Julian five years ago when his beloved parents died. He lived with a foster family until a relative took him in. He misses his parents every day, and this loss truly encompasses him, because they understood him, they supported his creativity, and made life fun.\"It's strange how many ways there are to miss someone. You miss the things they did and who they were, but you also miss who you were to them. The way everything you said and did was beautiful or entertaining or important. How much you mattered.\"Now a high school freshman, life couldn't be further from fun. Julian has a number of learning disabilities, including dyslexia, which make school absolute hell for him, and his teachers don't care enough to find out what his problems are, they just berate him, fail him, and send him to the principal. His fellow students ridicule him as well. And he constantly feels as if he is living on eggshells at home, where one wrong step could spell disaster.One day, Julian is shocked to encounter Adam, who was once his foster brother. Adam, a high school senior assigned to help the school psychologist track down Julian for his appointments (which he always conveniently misses), is excited to see Julian again. He remembers many of the things Julian enjoyed when he was younger, and does everything he can to integrate Julian into his wide circle of friends, despite the difference in their ages, and despite Julian's efforts to try not to call attention to himself.Adam, who tries valiantly to keep his own ADHD in check (not always successfully), is dealing with his own issues, including a crush on a long-time friend, and his best friend Charlie's unhappiness. But he wants Julian to be a part of his life, and he wants to understand what is happening to him\u2014why is he absent without warning for a few days, why is no one allowed over to his house, why would this relative that took Julian in all those years ago not pay for clothes that fit him?\"He's only four years younger than me, but I feel so much older, or maybe he feels so much younger. I used to think struggle was what aged you, but if that were the case, Julian should've been a hundred years old. Now I wonder if the opposite is true. Maybe instead of accelerating your age, pain won't let you grow.\"Things come to a head when Adam starts suspecting things are worse for Julian than he lets on, and Julian tries desperately to keep his friend from finding out the truth. Adam's quest to rescue his friend could wind up seriously endangering both of their lives.\nA List of Cages\n is a sad story that is all too commonplace. Julian is a tremendously special character whose hurt and pain reminded me a tiny bit of Jude's in \nA Little Life\n, although the books are vastly different. I enjoyed Adam's character, too, as well as those of his friends and even his mother. I never felt that these kids were more erudite than they should be, which happens all too often in young adult novels.While the plot isn't necessarily surprising (perhaps we've sadly all become a little too familiar with instances like these), Robin Roe pulls you in to Julian and Adam's stories, makes you care, and makes you feel in the process. I could have done without the one melodramatic plot point, but beyond that, this story gripped me from start to finish. It's hard to read at times because it is so harrowing, but there is light at the end of the tunnel.I hope this book finds a wide audience because of its subject matter, but also because Roe's storytelling ability is so powerful. I'm glad I had the opportunity to read it.NetGalley and Disney-Hyperion provided me an advance copy of the book in exchange for an unbiased review. Thanks for making this available!

I had been hearing nothing but positive things about it, particularly from people in the BookTube community. I used to think that the praise was quite exaggerated, but now I understand why this book has garnered so much hype.Essentially, A List of Cages is similar to Jennifer L. Armentrout's The Problem with Forever, in that it also explores the mechanics of foster care and its occasional, traumatic consequences. Furthermore, this book also features troubled characters who eventually find healing in each other's company. The protagonists, Adam and Julian, both have psychological problems. The former has ADHD, while the latter has a much more serious \"illness\" that is unraveled throughout the novel. Regardless of their four-year age gap, Adam and Julian are able to form a very platonic and meaningful friendship. As Julian's secrets are gradually brought to light, Adam becomes determined to protect him at all cost. That being said, A List of Cages is inevitably an emotional piece of literature.Honestly, A List of Cages made me tearful so many times. I felt quite stupid because I kinda expected it to give me positive feels only because it was published by Disney, which is famous for its love for happy endings. Believe me when I say that this book trumps Colleen Hoover's It Ends with Us in the popular list of Cry Worthy Books. Not-so-sincere apologies to Lily Bloom and Ryle Kincaid. If Adam and Julian won't make you cry (or at least tearful), then you need to have a doctor heal your stone cold heart!With that in mind, the best thing I liked about this book was its character-driven story. Given her background in psychology, I wasn't surprised that Robin Rowe really did an effort to create such impactful and inspiring characters. As flawed as they were, Adam and Julian's personalities felt so authentic. And since the novel was written in dual perspectives, I loved getting to know them in a deeper and virtually personal way. Adam's chapters were fun and lighthearted, while Julian's chapters were generally morose and tear-jerking. This seesaw of alternating voices definitely messed with my emotions, thereby giving me a wonderful and memorable reading experience.Overall, A List of Cages is YA contemporary fiction at its finest. It's a short novel that surprisingly has super substantial content. For the sake of objectivity, the only thing I did not like was its tendency to be shockingly graphic. I sincerely enjoyed this novel, and I would happily recommend it to all of my bookish friends. I just might reread it by listening to its audiobook version. :)"}, {"userName": "Lala BooksandLala", "userReviewDate": "Dec 02, 2016", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/31027440-lala-booksandlala", "userReview": "This book just destroyed me."}, {"userName": "Cait \u2022 A Page with a View", "userReviewDate": "Jan 08, 2017", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/47412532-cait-a-page-with-a-view", "userReview": "[the uncle repeatedly films himself whipping a naked Julian, who is so coveted in cracking cuts he can't sleep or walk.

It\u2019s not often that you find a YA book that primarily highlights the meaning of friendship and kindness. It was refreshing to read a book that didn\u2019t focus on romance. I absolutely loved Julian. He was an adorable cinnamon roll. The second half of this book is absolutely heartbreaking and I just wanted to give Julian a big hug. Julian: My main critique with this book is the writing style. While there were some very meaningful and quotable excerpts, overall I thought the writing quality was inconsistent. It had a bit of a middle grade vibe and I just tend to be someone who doesn\u2019t enjoy that. I thought the two main characters were developed, but the side characters lacked depth and felt like rough sketches of people. For some reason almost every single adult character was extremely terrible and unhelpful to the main characters. While I do understand that not every adult has the ability to deal with troubled kids, it felt a bit unrealistic that almost every teacher or police officer that they encountered would be *that* mean. But with those criticisms aside, I think the strength of this book is its message. I think this is an important book for younger readers. I think I would have really enjoyed it when I was in high school. Julian and Adam\u2019s narrative is one that I think can have a positive impact on readers.

This book ended up as one of the best books I read in 2016, because of the powerful message it brings.The story centres around two boys: Adam and Julian. It is told in first person, from both boys\u2019 POV.I loved how author managed for both voices to sound differently, which is very important for me when it comes to alternating perspectives.I enjoyed reading both point of views, but I have to admit that Adam\u2019s was more enjoyable for me, because Julien\u2019s was sometimes too hard to read (emotinally).That\u2019s why I question whether the word \u201cenjoyed\u201d is the right one to use. This book was great, even perfect at some point, but it was also very, very hard at times.Some situations in this story were emotinally draining.Robin Roe is not afraid to tell the story in realistic way. There\u2019s no sugarcoating.The violence is described in a way that it is not too descriptive, but shows you enough to make your eyes tear up.This is a work of fiction, but I honestly believe that similar cases to Julien\u2019s are happening right now in the world we live in (I still remember one episode of Oprah Show that I watched when I was a kid, with three brothers with similar fate as Julien\u2019s).Therefore, A List of Cages is so important! I think people of all ages should read it, and after they do, they should talk about it, talk about what happened in this story and make others read it too.This book tells us how important it is to find our voice and talk. And for those who can\u2019t, we have to help them find their voices, encourage them in a way we can, and never stop talking.There are so many awful things going on in the world right now, and raising our voices is one way we can at least try to make things better.Although A List of Cages is a novel that talks about serious topic, it also shows life of teenagers in a realistic way.There are funny scenes and everyday life moments.Parties, chrushes and bonding also found their places on pages.Because of that aspect, this novel reminded me of The Perks of Being a Wallflower (the movie, I still haven\u2019t read the book. Oh, and in case you didn\u2019t know, The Perks of Being a Wallflower is my all-time favorite movie. Ever!).Robin Roe did an amazing job when it comes to characterization.Her focus was not only on Adam and Julien who are \u201cstars\u201d of the story, but she also created side characters who weren\u2019t only interesting, but also went through development as well.My favorite character was Charlie. I loved his story and enjoyed reading about him.The writing style is really good.Once you start reading, it\u2019s hard to stop, and it reads quickly.If my Nook didn\u2019t chrash in the middle of reading, I would probably finish it even faster then I did.Overall, A List of Cages is a book that should find itself on everyone\u2019s tbr lists.I know that there\u2019s still no book that everyone likes, but in this case, I really think that many people should at least give it a try.Note: I got this book via Netgalley in an exchange for an honest review.

The entire ending I had huge, giant problems with. The biggest one being that for the level of abuse and trauma that occurred- and it was major, probably the worst I've ever read- there's no way to write light into this story. For me (emphasis on personal opinion), it ended without an ending. The recovery from everything Julian went through would be in a way harder than the events, and we didn't get to see his recovery... hardly at all. There were moments that felt really joyful and full of love, but not after the first half.

QUOTES ARE NOT FINAL AND SUBJECT TO CHANGE WITHOUT NOTICE.Review: 5 / 5\u201cThis part is hardest. A billion years of evolution tells your cells to run. But you can\u2019t run. You have to turn around and face the desert wall. You have to be still. He doesn\u2019t care if you cry, but you can\u2019t fight.A sound fills the air, then pain so sharp, you feel sick. Slash after slash, cutting deep, one on top of the other. They don\u2019t stop until you\u2019re screaming into your palms.\u201d\u2014 Robin RoeI do not believe that Robin Roe is a debut author, but yes, she is, and I am just blown away. This book doesn\u2019t come out until January, but it should be on everyone\u2019s radar right now. It may be too early, but I see this book having the success of All the Bright Places or Eleanor and Park. This book was such a surprise that words can\u2019t explain how great it truly is. The main story revolves around two boys and the friendship that they maintain through tragedy, love, and traumatizing events. It was a refreshing YA novel that takes the genre in a place that I haven\u2019t really seen done. (I know that events in this novel happen in other YA novels [the abuse], but I haven\u2019t come across novels.)\u201cIt\u2019s strange how many ways there are to miss someone. You miss the things they did and who they were, but you also miss who you were to them. The way everything you said and did was beautiful or entertaining or important. How much you mattered.\u201d\u2014 Robin RoeI am able to picture all of the characters in this novel because they are so relatable. The whole cast of characters are so realistic that I can relate them to people I see in my own life. That point just makes the book so much more personal and engrossing. This book is not something to be taken lightly, it is an emotional ride from beginning to end. If I could go back and read it for the first time again, then I would in a heartbeat. The authenticity of this book just makes the reader feel so in touch with the story and all of the characters involved. This book is going to be a massive hit with everyone who comes upon it.\u201cMy mother once said that the planet was like an enormous womb, and every single one of us was a fetus. Death was nothing to be afraid of. It was just birth to another world, and someone would be waiting for us there. Sometimes I try to see this, my mother and father as two newborns holding hands and ejected into this other world. There they are just beginning.\u201d\u2014 Robin RoeI grabbed this book on a whim because of the Emma Donoghue blurb on the back, but after reading it I can tell that there are going to more quotes for influential authors on the final copy. This is deserves to become a literary phenomenon (TFiOS level). If this doesn't get its rights picked up by a distribution company for a film, then I will be floored. Everyone do me a favor and support this book when it comes out, it is just that incredible."}, {"userName": "Sierra", "userReviewDate": "Apr 21, 2018", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/37553452-sierra", "userReview": "This story was adorable, sweet, and loving. I have been waiting to read this book for a while and I was not disappointed at all. Even after five years Adam still loved Julian like his brother. Adam and his mother never forgot about Julian and always wanted to know what happened to him after he was taken away. After Adam had been assigned to Julian, Julian remembered him right away. Adam remembered things that he used to do for Julian when they were both little to try and make him feel better. I freaking cried my eyes out when Adam found Julian in the trunk almost dying. I was amazed that Adam's friends accepted Julian into their friend group even though the question why a lot, especially Charlie. It took Julian a while to get used to having friends and to have someone look out and take care of him. But in the end he was back with Adam and his family. Even though he followed Adam around like a puppy and they both never left the house for a while. And let's just say that I hate Russell with a passion. Quotes that I loved/really liked: 1.) \u201cHate ricochets, but kindness does too.\u201d 2.) \u201cBecause people heal a whole lot faster when they're with someone who loves them\u201d 3.) \u201cGetting smacked in the face with a Harry Potter book does not qualify as a fight,\" Charlie says. \"First of all, it wasn't just any Harry Potter book. It was Order of the Phoenix.\"Matt gasps. He knows that Order of the Phoenix is the longest and most potentially dangerous of all the Harry Potter books when used as a weapon.\u201d4.) \u201cAnd when you smile\u2026my grandmother calls them big-soul smiles. She says some people have souls so big that they spread out, touching everyone they pass.\u201d Emerald wipes her wet face again. \u201cThere are different ways to help people, Adam. There are different ways to do good.\u201d 5.) \u201cI used to think struggle was what aged you, but if that were the case, Julian should have been a hundred years old. Now I wonder if the opposite is true. Maybe instead of accelerating your age, pain won't let you grow.\u201d 6.) \u201cIt's strange how many ways there are to miss someone. You miss the things they did and who they were, but you also miss who you were to them. The way everything you said and did was beautiful or entertaining or important. How much you mattered.... When you know you're going to tell someone everything, you see your day through your eyes and theirs, as if they're living it alongside you. But when you don't, it isn't only not seeing double--it's not seeing at all. Because if they aren't there, you aren't either.\u201d 7.) \u201cTheir eyes like safety nets, I can\u2019t fall.\u201d 8.) \u201cYou don\u2019t really know people when your back is turned.\u201d 9.) \u201cThis part is hardest. A billion years of evolution tells your cells to run. But you can\u2019t run. You have to turn around and face the desert wall.\u201d 10.) \u201cMonday is like all Mondays. Like I\u2019m sitting at the bottom of a pool, listening underwater to people living up above.\u201d 11.) \u201cNext time you have to hand something in, just tell me. I can proofread it or whatever.\" I nod, but I know I won't. If he's being nice enough to offer, I should be nice enough to never do it.\u201d 12.) \u201cSuperheroes aren't real, and even if they were, they come too late.\u201d 13.) \u201cI walk the perimeter of the fence, and try to summon what I used to feel back when I thought I could bend time and spoons. I touch the red grains in the wood. I have a vague memory of doing that.\u201d 14.) \u201cHe sounds so tired. \"I know if there was any choice at all, they wouldn't have left me alone. They would have made sure I was taken care of.\"In a heartbeat, a thousand memories at once. All the times I knew things I couldn't have known. All the times he was assigned to me. \"Julian,\" I say, \"maybe they did.\u201d15.) \"The very next day after Miss West and I\u2019d talked about her son and missions, she was the same as she\u2019d always been: volatile and unhappy with a hatred that spewed out of her like missiles. I thought I understood why. She must have hated us for being alive when her son was dead.Lately the class has been turning against her. They\u2019re openly hostile, and they whisper plots for revenge. It seems unfair, the way unhappiness flows out of a person, just to ricochet. \u201cAdam\u2026do you think we have a missions?\u201dHe looks at me with a confused expression. \u201cWhat kind of missions?\u201d\u201cI don\u2019t know. Do you think you have a mission?\u201dI shrug, disappointed. If Adam doesn\u2019t know, then I guess no one does. A girl turns onto our hall, eyes red and sad, and she passes, Adam sends her a smile. Her whole face brightens and she sends him a smile back. Hate ricochets, but kindness does too.16.) \u201cFor everyone else, talking just seems to come naturally. When someone says something, they automatically know what to say back. But for me it's as if the pathway between brain and mouth is damaged, like a rare form of paralysis. I can't speak, so instead I fiddle with the plastic tip of my shoelace.\u201d 17.) \u201cSuddenly he lunges forward, and I leap back. He halts, looking confused, and now I'm really embarrassed. It's Adam, and if he's lunging forward with open arms, it's probably just to hug me. But even so, the embarrassment and pain are all too much.\u201d18.) \u201cMom whispered, \"You know him?\"\"Yes.\" But it was like looking at a photo of a painting. Julian, twice removed.19.) \u201cNothing they're doing hurts, but it feels as if something is tearing away the center of my chest. The cold is dissolving. Their hands are soft. Everything is quiet except the tears that are climbing from somewhere beneath my ribs. I've cried in pain and I've cried in fear, but these tears are different, deeper, like I'm breaking apart.The noise should drive them away, but Emerald's hand stays, and Adam's hand stays, and he keeps washing my face long after it has to be clean.20.) \u201cMy mom could't fix me, but I remember she'd pet my back, and I know Julians father used to rub his head.There are different ways to help people Adam.I extend my fingers like I'm playing the piano across his face.21.) \u201cThe wind picks up, but instead of putting his sweatshirt back on, he just fits the hood over his head. As he walks forward, it billows behind him like a cape.22.) \u201cThen as he's tucking me into bed, he's supposed to ask, How many stars?On a great day I'm supposed to say nine or ten. But if it was amazing, the best day I ever had, I'm supposed to cheat and say something like ten thousand stars.\u201d 23.) \u201cHe was so stubborn, but maybe that's a good thing to be--a force of will that doesn't die no matter how many horrible things happen to you.\u201d"}], "description": "When Adam Blake lands the best elective ever in his senior year, serving as an aide to the school psychologist, he thinks he\u2019s got it made.
