Fractals are infinitely complex patterns that are self-similar across different scales. They are created by repeating a simple process over and over in an ongoing feedback loop. Driven by recursion, fractals are images of dynamic systems \u2013 the pictures of Chaos.Jules Henri Poincar\u00e9 29 April 1854 \u2013 17 July 1912) was a French mathematician, theoretical physicist, engineer, and a philosopher of science who made many original fundamental contributions to pure and applied mathematics, mathematical physics, and celestial mechanics.Fractals and Jules Henri Poincar\u00e9 are two underlying elements of a fascinating detective story imagined and beautifully presented by Leonard Rosen. I always like to learn something and to be challenged to think in new directions, even as horrible murders and very complicated investigations occupy the forefront of the story.Rosen does something else which is unusual. ALL CRY CHAOS shows an episode towards the end of an investigator's career. Volume 2 in this series titled \"The Tenth Witness\" (which I have not yet read) takes us back thirty years to the beginning of that career. This leaves lots to fill in if Rosen chooses to do so, which I hope he does.ALL CRY CHAOS also gives readers who are so inclined the opportunity to ridicule the end-of-days phenomena which seems to infect a surprising number of people from time to time. There is just enough of this thinking presented to suggest the deep despair and hopelessness that induces what most of find to be totally irrational illusions.Overall, an excellent and compelling read."}, {"userName": "Andy", "userReviewDate": "Apr 03, 2013", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/2199404-andy", "userReview": "From the previous reviews, plenty of people love this so maybe you will too, but I didn't. A detective descendant of the physicist Poincar\u00e9 investigates a math-based crime with so many people asking him if he's related to the other Poincar\u00e9 that even he gets tired of answering the question. Is this supposed to be funny or profound? It just seems contrived. Without giving away the plot, a major part of the book is about a threat to his family; the whole interaction there that sets up the maudlin personal backstory was frustratingly unbelievable. The protagonist's actions are so irresponsible that I found him unlikeable. This poor Poincar\u00e9 is unhappy in his skin and stumbles about sometimes acting more like Clouseau than Maigret. I guess that makes him \"complex\", but Harry Bosch, for example, is a complex, tortured detective character, and yet he knows who he is and acts accordingly. The main plot revolves around unnecessary drivel about religion and math. I appreciate the ambition of trying to pull all that together in a mystery. I like the exploration of Big Themes in novels, but for me, it just didn't work. Fractals are cool but they're not the secret of life, the universe and everything. Something much less cosmic could have driven the plot equally well. I don't get the comparisons to thrillers by Stieg Larsson, Dan Brown, etc. Those universes, while in some ways even more far-fetched, are much more internally coherent."}, {"userName": "Katherine", "userReviewDate": "Jul 07, 2011", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/3211847-katherine", "userReview": "First off it is important to note that I'm neither a mathematician nor am I terribly adept in math. I am however a biologist and so this book and its study of patterns, including pictures, totally engrossed me. The mystery is very satisfying and one is immediately drawn to Inspector Poincare of Interpol and his various cohorts, including the young shoot from the hip Paolo Ludovici. The characters are well drawn, the travels to solve a very convoluted case very real and the mystery itself multi-layered. The descriptions of Quebec City and of Amsterdam are spot on. In particular, having just experienced the Doomsday event that didn't happen, the whole descriptive chapter at the end of the book, when all the threads come together in Amsterdam's Dam is particularly well written. A world-wide computer generated enlistment program has culminated in a countdown to the Rapture on August 15--the circus atmosphere is repulsive, amusing, astounding and sad. It is interesting that the date chosen by the author is the Catholic feast day of the Assumption of Mary ( the Blessed Virgin ) into Heaven. Coincidence? Or that the discussion in the high Alps between Poincare and a math prof who taught in the science center at Harvard should sound so much like Stephen Jay Gould's Punctuated Equilibrium theory of evolution. Another coincidence? Don't know but it was a very interesting book and I really liked it and will read it again--it is one of those."}, {"userName": "Judy", "userReviewDate": "Dec 16, 2015", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/7409820-judy", "userReview": "A new author to me and what a writer.

While it is ostensibly a straightforward mystery, it is also a novel augmented by ideas and concepts not used everyday by mystery writers.Henri Poincare is a French Interpol agent on a path to find who murdered an American mathematician in Amsterdam. The goal is to find the person responsible, but primarily it is to also stop further violence conducted in the same precise way \u2014 small, highly targeted bombs designed to detonate in a very small area. Poincare\u2019s investigation takes him to France, Switzerland, Boston, Los Angeles and St. Paul/ Minneapolis. It involves terrifying personal circumstances, the reflections of an admired agent near the end of his career and some fascinating mathematics. The math is never too difficult - it mostly concerns fractal patterns found in nature and how things are similar to each other and how they are different from each other. It is this exposition of mathematics in the natural world that makes this book so different from other mysteries.

At first I thought it was much too slow. The hero, Henri Poincare, is French; an inspector for Interpol. I had trouble with the foreign names and keeping the characters sorted out. However, once I found my stride with the narrative voice, I was hooked.The plot features the murder of a mathematician, and the author did a phenomenal job of teaching me a bit about higher mathematics (fractals, anyone?) while he kept his story moving along. I love fiction that teaches me something, and leaves me thinking about theoretic ideas when I'm not reading the book. This one did that beautifully.Also, the author created a myriad of characters I cared about. Today, two days after I finished, I'm still wondering how they are doing. A great percentage of the characters were revealed to be motivated by good hearted intention, which I think is lacking in much of today's fiction.I am definitely going to read on in this series."}, {"userName": "Markus Himmelstrand", "userReviewDate": "Jun 08, 2014", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/32088635-markus-himmelstrand", "userReview": "Leonnard Rosen has put together a decent crime novel and the first chapters are pretty exemplary in how he's setting up his characters and their place in the world and the crime to be solved. However neither the characters nor the story has the necessary depth to sustain a whole novel and after a while I began to wonder why everyone kept repeating how good an investigator Poincar\u00e9 is and how he has 'aged with dignity' (of all things) when he seems to almost deliberately avoid the final conclusion which the reader might guess from the first chapter.Of course it makes some sense since the real story of the crime is fittingly absurd and naturally Poincar\u00e9 shouldn't reach it in a sane and real world but Leonnard Rosens world is not sane. It is already insane with christian suicide bombers, an end-of-days cult, overly simplistic international conflicts, and war criminals plotting revenge.It is a personal preference but to me tragedy and crime loses its impact when it is placed on the pile of a hundred other crimes and death is instead more powerful when it strips away the veneer of a just and normal world. Here this isn't the case, the veneer is never there, and especially the subplot involving Poincar\u00e9's family and his behavior following it is so unnatural that I could almost do a one eighty and recommend the book for that story alone because you have to read it to believe how awkwardly written it is.As to the general math theme that runs through the book I have to commend Rosens attempt at working it into a mainstream novel but it doesn't quite work. For example when Poincar\u00e9 enters a mathematicians apartment and attempts to describe how pictures on the wall are organized to display the unity of disparate (if not all) concepts in the world I could't help muttering to myself: Isn't this is what an insane person does?"}, {"userName": "Monica", "userReviewDate": "Aug 13, 2011", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/2128705-monica", "userReview": "I am not familiar with Leonard Rosen nor his main character in this book. The main character is Henri Poincare. He is an Interpol agent. All Cry Chaos is centered around Henri, his family and his cases.Poincare is given a case after a mathematician, James Fenster, is murdered on the eve that he is supposed to give a speech at the World Trade Organization meeting. I am no math wiz and found this story interesting and confusing at the same time. When math was being discussed I sometimes found myself reading it again just to make sense of it and other times remembering my times in school and just wanting to get the answer quickly.Poincare has a long list of suspects. You follow Poincare through all the interviews. Sometimes you were left hanging and felt there was something missing after the interview. There are a few sub-plots in this book. Poincare had caught a high profile murderer and he has threatened his family. Interpol is there to protect him but that is not enough. This is one plot that I found very interesting because of how it affected Henri and his ability to perform his job. Another sub-plot was the story of 3 orphans. The 3 children became orphans when their parents were killed in a car accident many years before. As the story progressed I found myself trying to figure out who the orphans were. When the end of the book is reached all my questions were answered and some I had figured out before.If you want a book with intricate story/plot lines, interesting characters with depth then I suggested trying All Cry Chaos."}, {"userName": "Linda", "userReviewDate": "Jan 29, 2012", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/3524127-linda", "userReview": "This book came to me on a recommendation from my local mystery bookstore, Once Upon a Crime. Apparently the author is local.But I never would have guessed. The incredible detail on international locations and the many customs and languages gave this book a flavor that was far from home. From Paris to Quebec to Amsterdam to Boston, with a short foray to Minneapolis and St. Paul, this was page-turning. I could not figure out how all these disparate narrative threads were going to come together. I cried in spots and that, to me, is a bit unexpected in a mystery. But Poincare is a very flawed, yet sympathetic hero. However improbable the events here, they all seemed to fall into place in the end. And with very technical details, which I became incredibly engrossed in, we went from the world of mathematics to cardiac care - and somehow, it's all related.I won't give a synopsis because there would be no way to do that, while still making it understandable, without giving something away.Suffice it to say I read this in three sittings, and would have read it in one if I could have."}, {"userName": "Larry", "userReviewDate": "Nov 04, 2011", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/2728477-larry", "userReview": "Henri Poincare is a high-ranking field investigator for Interpol in his late 50s who has spent several years tracking down the worst of the Serb war criminals.

The dead professor worked at the highest level of fractal analysis (the part is the whole, patterns in all objects or constructs seem to be similar, to grossly oversimplify), and that mathematical work, together with the efforts of a messianic doomsday cult whose members are engaged in terrorism on behalf of their vision, come together to present a case of great danger and complexity. Rosen sketches characters deftly. All come alive, even the most minor ones, but Poincare is a real find as a novelistic character.

I enjoyed the intricate characters and the personality of Henri Poincar\u00e9, purportedly the great-grandson of his famous namesake. The story is intricate, with many twists and turns. I sort of guessed where things were headed, but the ending is quite preposterous. The mathematician Fenster resembles Beno\u00eet Mandelbrot in several respects, both in terms of his topical focus and in terms of his attempts to extend fractals to a comprehensive world view. A scientific world view is not the same as religion, and the conflict between science and religion are not well-drawn.Grover Gardner does a good job with the voices of the different characters, and I enjoyed his reading.The denouement was rather disappointing to me, quite unbelievable in its details and philosophically unsatisfactory (and philosophy plays a large role in understanding the motives of the some of the principal actors.) The relation between science, mathematics, and religion is not well-drawn, yet it plays a big role in undertanding the motivation and behavior of a number of the central characters, although rather incidental to Poincar\u00e9 himself.An aside on the science and math described: The reader will get a good sense of the meaning of the notion of fractals and self-similar systems. The notion that the world is fundamentally fractal is not unprecedented; again, see the writings of Mandelbrot and, more generally, the approach called cellular automata, such as by Wolfram. Scientifically, this has not met with much success.As an aside, to the extent that the book touches on the work of the famous mathematician whose name the protagonist bears, it is not quite right. Although Poincar\u00e9 talked about \"relativity,\" (for example, in his 1904 lecture at the St. Louis World's Fare, he clung to Newton's absolute time and the ether concepts and even rejected the implications drawn by Einstein in his famous 1905 paper about \"special relativity.\" Indeed, Poincar\u00e9 disbelieved E=mc^2. Rosen states that Einstein owed a debt to Poincar\u00e9 for general relativity (published in its final form in 1916). That is simply not true. In fact, Poincar\u00e9 did not accept this as the correct theory of gravity. Although incidental to the plot, I was disappointed that the author did not do his homework on these matters."}, {"userName": "Meredith", "userReviewDate": "Oct 06, 2017", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/174861-meredith", "userReview": "This is one of the few mysteries I've read that almost needs to be read multiple times. Not because the plot is hard to understand but in order to think about everything else Rosen is saying. His constant theme about the structures of everything being the same (all those pictures of fractals), the destructiveness of the human species and our simultaneous desire for redemption, the significance of a family being scattered and then reunited, in fact the significance of family altogether. Our guide, Henri Poincare, is a likable and humane person, someone you want to spend time with. But even he didn't quite clarify it all for me, and it certainly left me feeling sad.

The hit is as elegant as it is bizarre. Fenster's Amsterdam hotel room is incinerated, yet the rest of the building remains intact. The murder trail leads veteran Interpol agent Henri Poincar\u00e9 on a high-stakes, world-crossing quest for answers. Together with his chain-smoking, bon vivant colleague Serge Laurent, Poincar\u00e9 pursues a long list of suspects: the Peruvian leader of the Indigenous Liberation Front, Rapture-crazed militants, a hedge fund director, Fenster's elusive ex-fianc\u00e9e, and a graduate student in mathematics. Poincar\u00e9 begins to make progress in America, but there is a prodigious hatred trained on him --some unfinished business from a terrifying former genocide case-- and he is called back to Europe to face the unfathomable. Stripped down and in despair, tested like Job, he realizes the two cases might be connected and he might be the link.This first installment in the Henri Poincar\u00e9 series marries a sharp, smart mystery to deep religious themes that will keep both agnostics and believers turning pages until the shattering, revelatory end. Anyone who enjoys the work of John Le Carr\u00e9, Scott Turow, Dan Brown, and Stieg Larsson will relish Rosen's storytelling and his resourceful, haunted protagonist. Others will appreciate his dazzling prose. Still others, the way he bends the thriller form in unconventional ways toward a higher cause, in the vein of Henning Mankell in The Man From Beijing. In short, All Cry Chaos promises to become a critical success that garners a broad readership throughout the nation and across the globe. (Amazon product description)ARC source: Library Thing early reviewersI loved this book, plain and simple. Reasons that I loved it: the plot catches your attention and drags you in, right off the bat. No waiting until 50 pages in to see what\u2019s going on. The detective is one of the most sympathetic and riveting characters I\u2019ve encountered in a long while. He is completely believable, and when his heart broke, mine did too. The author weaves math, specifically fractals, into the mystery in a way that is both integral (no pun intended) and educational\u2014but without making the reader actually DO any math. The supporting characters are all well-drawn as well; there are several of them that I would be happy to see featured in their own books. The ultimate solution to the mystery is both believable and surprising. Finally, the author uses the mystery to open up a discussion of questions of import: why are we here? Can good triumph? Can we make a difference? This book made my life happier for the days that I was reading it. I will for sure look for more books in the series, and I\u2019ll give All Cry Chaos a 5/5*."}, {"userName": "Joyce Lagow", "userReviewDate": "Aug 26, 2011", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/2220862-joyce-lagow", "userReview": "Henri Poincar\u00e9, the great-grandson of the legendary mathematician Jules Henri Poincar\u00e9, is an Interpol senior inspector based in Lyons; he has a small farm near the city where he lives with his wife, Claire. His son Etienne, his wife Lucille, and their three children, Georges, Emil and Grandpa\u2019s favorite, Chloe, live in Paris. Henri has recently concluded a case in which he tracked down Stipo Benovic, a genocidal Serbian murderer who was accused of massacring 70 Muslim men and boys in the recent civil war; Poincar\u00e9 is in The Hague to asusre himself that Benovic is securely in custody. But while there, an explosion surgically rips through the Ambassade Hotel, killing Dr. James Fenster, a Harvard mathematician who is in the Netherlands to give a seminar at the WTO annual meeting. The explosion is so hot that Fenster\u2019s corpse is charred beyond recognition, and identification is made through forensic means. Poincar\u00e9 takes on the case, since such an explosive is extremely sophisticated and may be the work of terrorists.But while in The Hague, Poincar\u00e9 receives word that Benovic has put out word to his organization to target Poincar\u00e9\u2019s family. Interpol sets up elaborate security measures for his family, allowing a reluctant Poincar\u00e9 to pursue the bombing case, which has started to take on puzzling aspects.So far, this could be the description of any number of international thrillers, such as those that Daniel Silva writes with his protagonist, Israeli agent Gabriel Allon. Plot looks familiar and there is a promise of nice twists.But Rosen has written a richly complex novel that interweaves such unlikely themes as fractals, an End Times Christian fundamentalist group called Soldiers of the Rapture who think that blowing people up will hasten the End Times by creating the necessary chaos for Christ\u2019s appearance, an indigenous people\u2019s liberation movement headed by a charismatic economist/herder, the functioning of the global economy, philosophy and theology. That\u2019s an impressive list of seemingly unrelated topics but Rosen, in a masterpiece of a debut novel, pulls them all together in an absorbing, compelling story. I defy anyone to resist the fascination of fractals after reading Rosen\u2019s superbly written book.On top of it all, Rosen\u2019s resolution to the plot opens up, for those of us who are interested in such questions, an interesting concept of God that is without doubt thought-provoking.All this and a beautifully written, fast-paced thriller as well.

From the description I expected a thriller (fine with me) with perhaps a mathematical element (also fine with me) , and it delivers on this expectation. Given that the detective is the descendant of a renowned mathematician and is described as having a sidekick who is a bon vivant, a reader might also expect some light elements in the book, and this is most definitely not the case. All Cry Chaos is an emotionally powerful exploration of what it takes to turn men into monsters, with many examples. It is beautifully done but not a happy read, as one might expect from the opening scene, which perfectly establishes the mood for the entire book:He [Poincare] knelt and with his good hand set fresh lilies on the grave. Dear heart, he said. They killed the wrong person. They should have killed me.I was fully prepared to give this book a 5-star rating until the denouement, which unnecessarily exceeds plausibility and verges on science fiction. Nonetheless, I recommend it highly.This seems to be the first book in a planned series, and I have serious doubts as to whether the author will pull it off. It would be hard to give the protagonist new experiences that would permit the kind of explorations of human nature found in this book, but to leave the philosophical musings out would produce a completely different genre.SIDE NOTE: All Cry Chaos created a totally accidental but interesting segue of reading for me. Reamde, which I read just before All Cry Chaos, was universally enjoyed by my science fiction group, but we all agreed it was not SF but a techno thriller, the opposite of All Cry Chaos. The Clockwork Universe, which I read after All Cry Chaos, is an intellectual history describing how scientists like Isaac Newton helped give birth to the modern world. There are interesting similarities in the settings of The Clockwork Universe and All Cry Chaos, such as the presence of apocalyptic sects expecting the imminent end of the world, and there are equally striking DIFFERENCES in the attitudes in the two societies depicted, in the first a \u201cclockwork universe\u201d designed by God to run on a minimum number of fixed laws and in the second an incessant reference to \u201cchaos\u201d in myriad aspects of life. The first and third books are very different from each other, but I would expect that a reader who liked either of them would probably also enjoy All Cry Chaos."}, {"userName": "George K.",

"userReviewDate": "Dec 29, 2014", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/5470988-cheryl", "userReview": "All Cry Chaos by Leonard Rosen is a beautifully written, atmospheric, spider web of a mystery story; it is easy to get caught up in it and be unable to do anything else until it is done. In fact, I am still thinking about it even after finishing it. The plot is deceptively simple: Henri Poincar??, a skillful & moral detective with a long history of solving cases for Interpol, is nearing retirement. One of his last cases involved bringing Stipo Banovic, accused of genocide in Bosnia, to justice. Banovic threatens him from jail. Poincar?? goes on to his next case, a very mysterious case of a mathematician killed in an unusual way just prior to giving a presentation at a global conference, WTO. In his patient, thoughtful way, Poincar?? begins unraveling the clues that lead to and from the scene of the crime. The clues include the mathematician's complicated presentation, which deals with fractals. Meanwhile, Poincar??'s family comes under attack, and Poincar?? must discover who is targeting them, and why. The cases become more and more complex, and the web around Poincar?? and his family wraps tighter and tighter, and the mathematician's obscure research begins to resound with Poincar?? until Poincar?? believes that it might have global implications. The deep & convoluted plot all does make sense (eventually!) and part of the pleasure of reading the book is to see how Poincar?? is able to begin interpreting the mathematician's work and other clues he discovers. It is also interesting to watch how Poincar??'s relationships with his family and colleagues and new acquaintances unfold as events take place. But the biggest pleasure of all in reading this book was the writing -- beautiful, descriptive, introspective. Take this small paragraph: \"He stared out the shop window to a small, bricked courtyard, contemplating what favors the world owed the dead. He had answered that question once when he spent the better part of two years hunting Banovic. He glanced over his case notes and supposed he would be answering it again.\" The book was littered with gems like these, which were really the icing on top of the great plot/interesting characters cake. Well worth reading (eating?!) and amazing to think that this is Mr. Rosen's first book. I can't wait to see what he writes next."}], "description": "10 hrs and 23 mins The action begins when mathematician James Fenster is assassinated on the eve of a long-scheduled speech at a World Trade Organization meeting. The hit is as elegant as it is bizarre. Fenster's Amsterdam hotel room is incinerated, yet the rest of the building remains intact. The murder trail leads veteran Interpol agent Henri Poincar\u00e9 on a high-stakes, world-crossing quest for answers.Together with his chain-smoking, bon vivant colleague Serge Laurent, Poincar\u00e9 pursues a long list of suspects: the Peruvian leader of the Indigenous Liberation Front, Rapture-crazed militants, a hedge fund director, Fenster's elusive ex-fianc\u00e9e, and a graduate student in mathematics. Poincar\u00e9 begins to make progress in America, but there is a prodigious hatred trained on him\u2014some unfinished business from a terrifying former genocide case\u2014and he is called back to Europe to face the unfathomable. Stripped down and in despair, tested like Job, he realizes the two cases might be connected\u2014and he might be the link.This first installment in the Henri Poincar\u00e9 series marries a sharp, smart mystery to deep religious themes that will keep both agnostics and believers turning pages until the shattering, revelatory end. Anyone who enjoys the work of John Le Carr\u00e9, Scott Turow, Dan Brown, and Steig Larsson will relish Rosen's story telling and his resourceful, haunted protagonist. Others will appreciate his dazzling prose. Still others, the way he bends the thriller form in unconventional ways toward a higher cause, in the vein of Henning Mankell in \nThe Man From Beijing\n. In short, All Cry Chaos promises to become a critical success that garners a broad readership throughout the nation and across the globe.", "title": "All Cry Chaos\n      \n          (Henri Poincar\u00e9 Mystery #1)", "url": "https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/38587678.All_Cry_Chaos__Henri_Poincareries___1_", "average": 3.7, "cover": "https://images.gr-assets.com/books/1518676449l/38587678.jpg", "reviews": 177, "authors": [{"url": "https://www.goodreads.com/author/show/358353.Leonard_Rosen", "name": "Leonard Rosen"}, {"url": "https://www.goodreads.com/author/show/277654.Grover_Gardner", "name": "Grover Gardner"}], "type": ["Mystery", "Fiction", "Thriller", "Mystery", "Audiobook"], "outlinks": ["http://www.goodreads.com/book/show/38587678-all-cry-chaos", "http://www.goodreads.com/book/show/11276223-all-cry-chaos", "http://www.goodreads.com/book/show/10628624-all-cry-chaos-henri-poincare", "http://www.goodreads.com/book/show/17233995-the-tenth-witness", "http://www.goodreads.com/book/show/40383185-decisions---a-writer-s-handbook", "http://www.goodreads.com/book/show/40301081-the-kortelisy-escape", "http://www.goodreads.com/book/show/40248325-the-kortelisy-escape", "http://www.goodreads.com/book/show/40248324-the-kortelisy-escape"]}
