It's just such a wonderful feel-good book. The kind that leaves you happy when you have finished reading it.The Prayer Box is the first book in the Carolina Heirlooms series. There are also a couple of novellas you can read. I've read the last book in this series; The Sea Keeper's Daughters before I read this one and I was so enthralled by the book that I wanted to read the previous books in the trilogy.Tandi Jo Reese has fled her old life and arrived on the Hatteras Island with her two children where she is renting a cottage that belongs to Iola Anne Poole. When Iola Anne Poole dies is Tandi worried that she wouldn't be allowed to stay at the cottage and she has no job and not much money left to support herself and her children. But she is lucky and she gets to stay if she cleans out Iola Anne Poole's house. There she discovers prayer boxes filled with letters that tell Iola Anne Poole life. While she reads the letters she discovers a new side to Iola Anne Poole that no one knows about and at the same time Tandi herself change. She get's a job and suddenly life seems a lot brighter...I loved this story because you got to follow Tandi as she transforms from the wreck she was when she came to Hatteras Island to a new stronger person that's not controlled by the past. She is not a very good mother and she has a new boyfriend that isn't much better than the one she left behind in her old life. But reading the letters and making new friends slowly turns her life around.I enjoy reading books that have a parallel storyline and this was one especially good. It manages to not cross the line to become too saccharine. I was annoyed with Tandi's boyfriend Ross and Gina, Tandi's sister, but they played their roles in the story. They had to be there to make her realize that she could turn her life around and not be the person she was before. I was really proud of Tandi towards the end of the book.I wrote in my review for The Sea Keeper's Daughters that you can read the books as stand-alone, but I would personally recommend you to read them from the beginning, because Tandi has a small part in The Sea Keeper's Daughters (don't know yet if she's in the second book) and it's probably more fun to read them in the right order."}, {"userName": "Sarah", "userReviewDate": "Jun 27, 2014", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/8075507-sarah", "userReview": "I am not free with five-star reviews. But when a novel leaves me teary-eyed and feeling a step closer to heaven there is nothing to do but hurry out and tell the world HERE is a book worth your time. I love stories that let me come along as characters who are at rock bottom slowly find their way back into the light. Add in a wonderful, old house in need of saving and I'm almost guaranteed to be a fan. But Lisa gave me so much more than a lovely story and rich characters--she gave me her heart. It's a brave writer who pours that much heart and soul onto the page and I'm so glad Lisa had the courage to do it.My favorite moment: \"Forgive me, Father, for asking for another day yet, and another beyond that, when this one is so very beautiful. We, in our humanness, cannot help but foolishly desire eternity in this life.\"Seems like there's a Bible verse about God setting eternity in our hearts.

I would give this one 3 1/2 stars. And once, again, I find myself a bit conflicted about a book. While I really did enjoy reading this book, it wasn't /isn't without its issues.I struggled with Tandi. She was so spineless, and yet at the same time, had enough courage to get out of a bad situation and off of her painkillers. She was such a frustration to me that at times I wasn't sure I wanted to continue reading about her. And no, I didn't think she was very well developed - just a \"being\" being tossed to and fro with no will. Yet, at crunch time she became a pretty perfect mother practically overnight. Hmmm, don't think so.The plot was pretty predictable. Not anything extraordinary. But - and to me this is an important point: the writing more than makes up for everything else. There were long passages where I wanted to make note, to remember, to write down somewhere and return to. Ms. Wingate does have a lovely way with words. The writing is clean and uplifting, the kind that makes you want to read every word and not skim even a bit in case you might miss something. Even though the message is a bit preachy and heavy-handed. I don't remember her other books being that way. Still, though, well worth my time.I always look forward to the next offering from Ms. Wingate. Once in a while the book is more of a \"miss\" than a \"hit\" but generally always enjoyable.Interestingly enough, just the other day the prequel novella was a free Kindle book.

She is also breaking her drug addition, fostered by her husband. She ends up in the Outer Banks, the one place of happy memories spent with her beloved grandfather. When her elderly landlady, Iola Ann Poole, dies she agrees to clean out the house in exchange for free rent for the small guest cottage. When Tandi discover's Iola's letters to God, she must examine her own life. Her childhood was one of neglect and disfunction. She had her now teenage daughter when she herself was but a teen. Tandi has not been a good mother, her daughter too often caring for her nine year old brother. Through the letters Iola wrote, Tandi discovers a chance for grace, forgiveness and faith. I love Iola and how she choose to do and see good in all situations. With Iola's guidance offered in her letters, and the embrace of the townspeople, Tandi discovers the woman she wants to be. Love this quote from one of Iola's letters: \"Father, help these young people to see. Help them to show the world that our greatness is not in things we do for ourselves, but in things we do for others. In power that channels itself into kindness, in a hand outstretched in love. Be with these determined students. Help them to believe, when the naysayers come, that you make all things possible.\""}, {"userName": "Miranda A.

At first I found myself upset with her because I expected more from her as a mother. But as the story went on, I discovered the root of her vulnerability\u2014this was her first time being independent and she was trying to find her footing. She eventually grew into a strong, admirable woman, beautiful on the inside as well as the outside. I applaud Lisa in the manner she paced Tandi\u2019s personality development. Her emotional responses were duely appropriate for each circumstance as the story went along.What I loved most about this story was the manner Lisa crafted Paul. He had no dramatic entrance into the story (or Tandi\u2019s life), and he was no typical hero\u2014tall, dark and handsome. His sense of fashion always made me laugh. There was nothing drop-dead-gorgeous about it. The best part is, all these didn\u2019t stop his sweet, nice and generous character from shining through the pages. I thought that was excellent craftmanship.The plot was great and the story structure was solid. Secondary characters were introduced at just the right time, and none unnecessarily littered any scenes.Something I found pleasantly unique about this story was how Iola\u2019s left-behind letters were such a blessing and source of healing to not only Tandi and her family, but also her entire community, despite what they thought of her. This story drew out these classic lessons:1. It doesn\u2019t matter how silent you believe your life may be. Even after you\u2019re gone God can still use you to have great impact.2. Do not worry about what people think of you. Trust God\u2019s way and His Truth because in the end, His Truth will always vindicate you, either in this life or in the next.3. The worst thing you could ever do to yourself is to pay attention to rumors. Never ever judge a matter from a distance.I must say this: this story is not so much about romance. The author was probably more interested in showing healing and growth in a broken person, and how God restored self-worth and other good things to that person, even making her a blessing to her community. It is a sweet story and will most likely leave you reflective. I recommend it."}, {"userName": "Virginia", "userReviewDate": "Aug 01, 2013", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/7669658-virginia", "userReview": "THE PRAYER BOXBy Lisa WingateI will never be able to look at a cute little box again and think just cute. In my mind and heart, it will hold precious memories. Tandi Jo had been given just such a box when she was a young girl, but over the years it had been lost as she was tossed from family, to foster homes and sometimes to her beloved grandparents. The little box had meant so much to her. Her life almost destroyed many times over, Tandi brings her children to the Outer Banks, running yet again from someone seeking to destroy her. In the little cottage, beside the large old Victorian, Tandi and her two children have to learn to be a family again. Running out of money for rent, for food and gas, Tandi needs to find a job. When the church next door offers her the job of going through the old Victorian and cleaning it up Tandi says yes. Going through the kitchen, she finds food that will keep the hunger away. Going through a bedroom closet, she finds boxes and boxes of letters that feed her soul. Though Iola Anne has passed, her letters reach a part of Tandi that no one has ever reached before. The island and its inhabitants soon become a safe haven for Tandi and her children, just as it did for Iola Anne\u2026except Iola was almost a recluse. She was a recluse and no one on the island ever suspected or saw her big heart of love\u2026or the secret she had to hide. In so many ways, on this island love comes full circle. Like the pebble thrown into the pond, the ripples just keep going until they reach the shores of home. This book opens up places you don\u2019t realize are hidden within yourself. Open the first page and find your treasure\u2026."}, {"userName": "Pamela", "userReviewDate": "Mar 07, 2015", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/20048096-pamela", "userReview": "I put off writing this review for nearly a week. Not because I couldn\u2019t think of anything to say. (Those who know me would never describe me as speechless.) I wasn't under time constraints or laboriously engaged. Quite simply, Wingate\u2019s novel spoke to me on so many levels. Frankly, I was overwhelmed, trying to rein in compress all of my thoughts/emotions/opinions into a mere paragraph or two. No sooner would I sit at the keyboard, my eyes would well up and rain; thinking about a lifetime of successes and failures - a journey of sorrows and joys - ongoing, upwards, onward, ever hopeful \u2013 fictional, and otherwise.Now that I've gotten my emotions back in check, I\u2019ll write a line or two then let a few of quotes from this delightful novel speak for themselves.The Prayer Box is truly an amazing story of surprising breadth, depth, and introspective intrigue. The characters were identifiable and relatable to both the story-line and real life situations.

Beautiful, beautiful and ... beautiful.OK, that was one word, but one so true about this story that it deserved to be repeated three times.With a gift for crafting a story that digs into how a person's past can shape their view of themselves and of hope itself, Lisa Wingate never disappoints to deliver a first-class novel. The Prayer Box is just that sort of book. Through Tandi's eyes, we experience the life of a very real woman, shadowed by her past \u2014 a past that was pretty messed up by the adults of her childhood. Having spent most of her adult life moving from wrong man to \"wronger\" man and bad choice to worse choice, Tandi grasps on to one solitary memory of happiness and peace from her childhood and steals away from Texas \u2014 and a controlling, unethical man \u2014 to the Outer Banks.When her elderly landlord dies, Tandi unexpectedly finds employment sorting through the woman's belongings. As Tandi immerses herself in the letters found in Iola Anne's once-palatial home, change begins within her heart; a change that reflects into her life and the lives around her. Iola's letters allow Tandi a glimpse into a world where people give without expecting anything in return, love knowing they are bound to be hurt, and work hard to safeguard the things that are beautiful and true in the world.Although the story may lean more toward women's fiction than contemporary romance, romance is most definitely present--in both negative and positive forms. As Tandi realizes who she was, is, and can become, she finally begins to recognize the difference between being some hot guy's glorified arm candy and being cherished by an unusual, and unusually wonderful, man.Expect both smiles and tears as you read this beautiful novel, but do read it.

But it took me the first third to get into the story. In all honesty I almost didn't read past 40% on my Kindle because I just wasn't engaged yet.

The present day centers on Tandi who is a young single mother trying to keep her two kids fed. When her landlord, Iola Anne, passes away the church that inherited the house gives her the opportunity to clean it and she says yes. At first she is just excited to have some extra food from the kitchen to take home to her kids. But as she continues to explore the old house she finds these boxes filled with letters.At first you think that Iola Anne is actually writing her dad but after awhile you realize the letters are actually prayers and the \"father\" she is referring to is her Heavenly Father.

(would recommend reading \u201cThe Seaglass Sisters- a novella), prior to \u201cThe Prayer Box\u201d. Tandi has no job  and no means to support herself and her children and she is trying desperately to start over. She has escaped taking pills to drown her problems from Texas and wants to be a good mother and be a better person. She managed to find a guest cottage and then the landlord (an elderly woman-Iola Anne \u2013 so inspiring and so want her to be my grandmother) dies. Tandi agrees to help clean the house in trade for living in the cottage. However, Tandi finds letters which began to change her life. The letters give her a glimpse into a world where people share and give without expecting anything in return. She learns about this incredible woman and how her presence affected so many in the town. She begins to find  strangers who become friends, opening their hearts and their lives to her. She has to break her old habits and connections and love unconditionally and allow people into her world, who have her best interest at heart.This was my first book by Lisa and look forward to reading more! I listened to the audible version and Xe Sands (one of my favorites) was excellent in her performance as was ideal for the older lady and the younger woman voices.

The main character Tandi comes across as very real. She wants to be a better person, but doesn't always make the best choices. A secondary character is Iola. The reader gets to know Iola through her letters and her story adds depth to the novel. The novel is full of a caring cast of characters and a few losers as well. All of them come across as so realistic. My heart went out to Tandi's son JT. I really liked how the novel ended. No epilogue to tie a bow on how everything ends.

I love how she learned how she was worthy of love, not because of anything she did or didn't do, but because she is a daughter of God.I absolutely adored Ms Iola Anne, which is weird to say as she was dead by the time the book began.

Lisa Wingate\u2019s The Prayer Box captured the essence of a lifelong faith in one character (Iola Anne Poole) and the seedling of hope in another (Tandi Jo Reese). There were times I wanted to wring Tandi\u2019s neck for the choices she was making. But other times I wanted to wrap her in a hug and tell her everything would turn out right in the end. And I\u2019m pretty sure I would love hanging out with the Seashell Shop gals! All in all, Lisa crafted a charming story that seemed timeless and real. I didn\u2019t want to set the book down to proofread another, and I\u2019ll be looking forward to the next Wingate book on my list (which happens to be The Story Keeper).In The Prayer Box, Tandi Jo Reese learns a thing or two about faith and family when she becomes responsible for cleaning out the large Victorian house of her recently deceased landlady, Iola Anne Poole. One day, while cleaning, Tandi discovers a closet full of mysterious boxes, but it\u2019s what\u2019s inside the boxes that holds the power to change her life \u2026 if she chooses to grab on to the opportunity.

Usually every spare minute I have I'm grabbing the book I'm engrossed in, but I always kept finding something else to do instead. My first problem with the book was that I detested the main character -- a mom who had neglected her children for many years while she fed her narcotic addiction and allowed herself to continuously be manipulated by self-serving, bullying men at the expense of the needs of her children. As expected, she redeemed herself somewhat in the end, but it was a bit late in the picture for me. The real story was found in the letters in the prayer box. Iola was a mixed race woman who lived alone and was scorned by most of the occupants of Hatteras Island.

Tandi\u2019s quest to solve the mystery of Iola Anne Poole\u2019s life becomes the reader\u2019s own.

I also thoroughly enjoyed Tandi\u2019s love-hate relationship with Iola\u2019s cat and was heart-glad when Tandi connected meaningfully with the ladies at Sandy\u2019s Seashell Shop.

Some parts were riveting and I identified with the heroine, Tandi. Other times the book seemed to drag a bit and I found myself skimming. It's definitely women's fiction and not a romance. I don't mind stories where there are things tied to the past. I remember going to an attic once when a friend of my parents bought an old Victorian house and finding a lot of cool stuff in there from the 1800s. That part of the story was good. I also liked the interaction between her and the new friend who had terrible fashion sense. He wasn't the type of guy she went for, but was a good friend. It's probably the only healthy relationship she had.I found it interesting that in some ways her childhood repeated itself. Her daughter seemed frustrated with her absence just like she was frustrated as a child by her mother constantly abandoning her to go out and have a good time. Her childhood seemed pretty tragic. I didn't care for her sister or the man Tandi was dating, Ross. He seemed pretty stuck on himself and manipulative, just like the guy she married before, only not as severe.

It was the strong reason I choose to review the book and they didn\u2019t disappoint. They add a dimension to the story that takes the reader from the past to the present and back again.Characters are compelling and interesting and the story flows with a sense of interest for this reader. If anything, the story itself might have been a bit drawn out and overlong, but the telling in and of itself is enjoyable and fulfilling.This review is my honest opinion. Thanks to the publishers for my copy to review."}, {"userName": "Melissa", "userReviewDate": "Jun 18, 2013", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/721595-melissa", "userReview": "4.5 stars, very touching and meaningful tale. Minus a half star because I felt like a couple of storylines weren't fully completed (like the one with her sister). Overall though, excellent book and very worthwhile read.Readers will delight in this gorgeously written, true gem of a novel. Wingate has a way with phrasing that makes one stop and savor certain passages because they are incredibly meaningful \u2014 not only to the telling of the tale, but to the reader\u2019s own life. Realistic characters and a saga of life, love and rebuilding make a gorgeous treat.When Tandi Reese escapes an abusive relationship in Texas, she moves to a guest house on an estate in the Outer Banks with her two children. Tandi has never been a responsible parent, and she hasn\u2019t changed her ways much since the move. When Iola Anne Poole, their elderly landlady, dies, Tandi is given the responsibility of helping to clear out the house. She discovers multiple boxes of letters \u2014 prayers Iola wrote to God over the past 80 years. Tandi learns a great deal about herself and the direction in which she wants to head while reading about Iola\u2019s life.https://www.rtbookreviews.com/book-re..."}, {"userName": "Kathy Gange", "userReviewDate": "Jul 01, 2017", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/44524762-kathy-gange", "userReview": "I truly enjoyed this books.

It definitely went to the top of my 2017 favorites list. Could not put it down and had to know how it ended. This is a rich, emotional story that brought me to laughter and tears. One of the most inspirational fiction books I have read in a long time. There are so many incredibly wonderful things to say about this book:The dual time line was used superbly to show the grace that was extended to Tandi by God and through Iola's beautiful letters to her Heavenly Father. And then, in turn, through Tandi back to Iola after her death. The differences in male-female relationships as displayed by their actions between Tandi and Ross and Tandi and Paul. The slow awakening of Tandi to her role as a parent, as a woman, and as a Christian as well as her growth as a person and her developing self-confidence.The sense of God's presence in every day life as seen in Iola's letters. I could list so many more things that just shone through the incredible writing of Lisa Wingate. I will be going right back to the prelude: The Sea Glass Sisters to read about how this wonderful group of loving ladies began their journey together. I met them in A Sandy's Seashell Shop Christmas and just loved them then. Highly recommend this series for those who love to read great inspirational fiction.FAVORITE QUOTES: (Oh so many to include them all.)\"It felt good to do something good for someone else. To add a few deep-fried droplets of kindness to the world. A little act of service. Is it possible that all service is worship?\"\"Yet amid all this, there is the water of grace. It flows in all directions, seeping into the hidden crevices, the darkest spaces.\"\"After the storm, all are equal. All wanting. All needed. All in need of the water of grace from one another and from you....There is so much good. So much grace. So much pouring into the river. A quiet water, this river of grace. It's work done in ways that do not seek attention. Yet it is there. Always there.\" (This reminded me so much of what was seen during Harvey and Irma.)\"Prayers are answered in ways we don't choose.\""}, {"userName": "Penelope Pugh", "userReviewDate": "Apr 28, 2018", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/2545941-penelope-pugh", "userReview": "I wasn\u2019t sure if I was going to like this one. It was set up a bit like a Hallmark channel movie...however, it was well put together with mostly believable characters. And Really, who doesn\u2019t like a happy ending now and again?! I also really liked the overall message of the book - turning your prayers over to God.

Love the setting for this in the outer banks and she recalls being there with her grandparents, closeby the house that was featured in 'Nights in Rodanthe'. There is also talk of the ship that didn't make ti to shore and the wild ponies.She has run away from her husband in TX after having suffered an injury from falling from a horse-and she's attempting to get off of pain killers and just drives til she reaches the end of the road. She meets a 90 year old woman who rents her the bungalow out front and she and her teen daughter and younger son live with her.She's trying to get a job with no luck as it's only April-tourist season won't start for another month or so. After she finds the old woman dead and learns the church will inherit the house and bungalow she agrees to clean the house for the church in lieu of payment for the bungalow.Tandi also has met a guy there, Ross who house sits and does long haul trucking.She is determined to just rid the house of all personal possessions til she reads a few of the letters the woman had written to her father. Then she discovers a rosary and knows she must go through every box before just tossing them out.She has been feeding the cat but she has no idea how he gets in/out of the house and water in the bathroom is running at times-almost like a ghost wants her to do something n a certain room upstairs.She's been finding so many clues as to who Iola Anne really was, and Zoey her daughter comes down with an illness that will keep her from her many jobs.Really liked how this book moved along-never a dull moment. Troubles arise when her sister tracks her down and she does cause trouble...Loved most the seashell store and all the design work, pink and light blue seaglass and what those working there mean to Tandi.Few characters that are easy to keep track of while others are introduced.Loved how she fought for what she believed in...She feels a bond knowing others had to raise her and she finds out why...I received this book from JKS Communications in exchange for my honest review."}, {"userName": "Brandi (Rambles of a SAHM)", "userReviewDate": "Aug 25, 2013", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/10154315-brandi-rambles-of-a-sahm", "userReview": "When we are young we are subject to the decisions of our parents. As we grow older we are responsible for our own choices. Many times however we fall into the trap of doing what we know. That is the plight of Tandy Jo Reese. She's grown up with completely dysfunctional parents and ultimately wound up in the foster care system. Things began looking up for her but she continually reverts to doing what she has grown up learning.We pick up the story at the point where she has escaped with her two children from an abusive relationship. She has come to Hatteras Island to start over but starting over isn't always the easiest. At the beginning of the story I just did not like Tandy. She's a terribly negligent mother just like her own mother. Then Providence intervenes in the form of an old lady dying and a house needing cleaned out.Iola Anne Poole has lead a quietly faithful life in her family's home on Hatteras Island. Upon her death her home begins to divulge her secrets to Tandy and that is what begins to make the difference to Tandy and eventually her children.This is a beautifully written story about the power of grace, both given and received. One faithfully lived life can and does impact those around them in ways that go beyond what is visible. The power of the prayers of one person can reach and impact so many people. You will walk away from this novel pondering how your life impacts others now and how it will influence generations to come.On a side note there is a secondary story of sorts going on over at the Seashell Shop. Treat yourself to the full story by reading the prequel, The Sea Glass Sisters: Prelude to the Prayer Box. It is available as an ebook for all the popular devices.A book was provided to facilitate this review."}, {"userName": "Holly", "userReviewDate": "Aug 31, 2013", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/3863059-holly", "userReview": "I am finding that I really enjoy Lisa Wingate's writing. She takes her time telling the story of life allowing the reader to get to know the main character as well as those around them. The main character, Tandi, was a character that was easy to fall in love with and to root for as she struggled to get own her feet and take care of her children. She is very honest in her fears and her desire to survive.The story was wonderful. As Tandi started reading Iola Anne's letter's, it hit me, \"What a wonderful idea!\" In Iola Anne's letters to her Father we see what life was like for her growing up in the time she did. She shared every aspect of her life with Him, just like He wants each of us to do. I also enjoyed how through Iola Anne's words written so many years before Tandi's heart was touched. There is also times of tension and times when Tandi wants to give up. As in life there were times when you could chuckle along with the characters.This is a feel good story that gave me moments to reflect, laugh, and cry. If you are an adrenaline junkie and need fast paced action packed story, this is probably not your book. But let's face it, life isn't like that and that what this story gives you, a dose of life.Disclosure: I did receive this book from the author but was under no obligation other than to give my honest opinion."}, {"userName": "Charmaine", "userReviewDate": "Jan 10, 2015", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/5887715-charmaine", "userReview": "I really liked this book! However I can't quite rank it with the 5 star books that I absolutely LOVE. If there were a 4.5 star rating, that's what I'd give this novel. The story line is interesting and intriguing and the characters are very well developed. I feel as if I'd know them if I met them on the street! The setting, Hatteras Island on the outer banks of N.C., completely drew me in - and now I want to go there! But the very best part about this novel are the written prayers themselves, found in decorated boxes in the home of the deceased Iola Anne Poole. As the story of Iola's life comes to light through the discovery of these prayers, the reader is given a gift. The prayers are beautifully written - almost like poetry - and are full of depth of spirit and love for Father. And, best of all, this book is totally and completely CLEAN - no profanity and no descriptive sex scenes, which is a rarity in itself for a modern novel. There are more books in this series and I hope to find audio copies of those as well. This is a story I can highly recommend."}], "description": "When Iola Anne Poole, an old-timer on Hatteras Island, passes away in her bed at ninety-one, the struggling young mother in her rental cottage, Tandi Jo Reese, finds herself charged with the task of cleaning out Iola's rambling Victorian house.Running from a messy, dangerous past, Tandi never expects to find more than a temporary hiding place within Iola's walls, but everything changes with the discovery of eighty-one carefully decorated prayer boxes, one for each year, spanning from Iola's youth to her last days. Hidden in the boxes is the story of a lifetime, written on random bits of paper--the hopes and wishes, fears and thoughts of an unassuming but complex woman passing through the seasons of an extraordinary, unsung life filled with journeys of faith, observations on love, and one final lesson that could change everything for Tandi.", "title": "The Prayer Box\n      \n          (Carolina Heirlooms #1)", "url": "http://www.goodreads.com/book/show/17714301-the-prayer-box", "average": 4.05, "cover": "https://images.gr-assets.com/books/1406822441l/17714301.jpg", "reviews": 1139, "authors": [{"url": "https://www.goodreads.com/author/show/178832.Lisa_Wingate", "name": "Lisa Wingate"}], "type": ["Christian Fiction", "Fiction", "Christian", "Contemporary"], "outlinks": ["http://www.goodreads.com/book/show/17714301-the-prayer-box", "http://www.goodreads.com/book/show/18639487-the-prayer-box", "http://www.goodreads.com/book/show/17861910-the-prayer-box", "http://www.goodreads.com/book/show/18869627-the-prayer-box", "http://www.goodreads.com/book/show/18319178-the-prayer-box", "http://www.goodreads.com/book/show/32148570-before-we-were-yours", "http://www.goodreads.com/book/show/514301.Tending_Roses", "http://www.goodreads.com/book/show/1514230.Talk_of_the_Town", "http://www.goodreads.com/book/show/21539471-the-story-keeper", "http://www.goodreads.com/book/show/25018230-the-sea-keeper-s-daughters"]}
