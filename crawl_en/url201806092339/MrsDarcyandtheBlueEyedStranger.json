In a collection of short stories like this, written by one author, it can be tempting to just read one after the other and then then before you know it, you've finished them all and don't really remember much. Kind of like eating Oreos out of the box. It's hard for me to articulate what it is exactly that I loved so much about these stories, aside of course from the impeccable voices and excellent writing, but I'll try. The characters are all small town women with seemingly small town lives, but once they get talking you see how big it all really is. But, at the same time, small. Often these characters go into deep detail about their past adventures which include things that we'd lament over (or at least I would lament over) and perhaps give us ulcers or a stay at a nice safe hospital for a while. And these events are just ticked off with the same cadence and weight as other things. It's all just life after all, these things happen to everyone, just in the course of living. A sampling of the sort of thing I'm talking about:Paul had been drunk, of course. Drunk, or he might not have lived at all, somebody said later, but I don't know whether that was true or not. I think it is something people say after wrecks, whenever there's been drinking. He had been driving back to W&L from Randolph-Macon, where he was dating a girl. This girl wrote Mama a long, emotional letter on pink stationary with a burgundy monogram. Paul was taken by ambulance from the small hospital in Lexington, Virginia, to the University of Virginia hospital in Charlottesville, one of the best hospitals in the world. This is what everybody told me. Mama went up there immediately. Her younger sister, my aunt Liddie, came to stay with us while she was gone.I leave the book feeling empowered like I'd just read a self-help book (which I would never do). Her characters are inspirational. They encourage you to just do whatever it is you've been wanting to do and then don't sweat it because if it doesn't work out how you'd hoped, you can just write it all down and entertain people with the tale someday."}, {"userName": "Evanston Public  Library", "userReviewDate": "May 28, 2010", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/1975296-evanston-public-library", "userReview": "Lee Smith speaks \"southern.\" The voice she gives to her characters rings true to this region's rich culture and customs. Her wonderful collection of new and selected short stories feature mostly women protagonists coping with love, loss, and life's major turning points. Smith is skilled at infusing her writing with a gentle drollness that will make you smile, and her sensibility is rich with emotional content, but without sentimentality or cloying sweetness.

Somehow I have managed to miss her influence until hearing a recent provocative interview on NPR and purchasing her current volume of short stories, both old and new. These 14 tales might be compared to hors d'oeuvres...tasty, spicy, and not unpalatable, but they do not a meal make. Even the vegetarians among us may ask: \"Where's the meat?\" The stories certainly have well-crafted characters and intelligible plot lines, but even the best, such as \"House Tour\" and \"Between the Lines,\" offer little more than a pleasant respite in the waiting room for your physcian to appear or the mechanic to complete your service check. Indeed, such writing serves a useful purpose and Smith is good at what she does, but I find these \"new 'slice of life' stream of consciousness style of short stories...unsatisfying\" to echo the words of an esteemed Goodreads reviewer JudithIn truth, Smith should be compared to her Southern contemporary Bobbie Ann Mason, another storyteller who has produced many short stories and a few novels. Mason also deals with modern life among the less than fortunate in an often rustic and difficult environment. In truth, however, such a comparison is specious since Mason not only offers characters for whom we care deeply, but provides pithy dialogue and (shockingly) a denouement (satisfying or not). However, my review is not of this accomplished author...and Ms. Smith, you are no Bobbie Ann Mason! It is not that we hunger for more from Smith since some of her stories are up to 50 pages long. However, what they provide in length is not matched in substance; one has a feeling of indifference to her topics and characters. Once the page is turned, the memory fades and we keep waiting for that perpetually late doctor or that promised service repair or maybe thinking of what to prepare for dinner.Those requiring more substantial literary meals may wish to look elsewhere, such as Mason. Afterall, \"the proof is in the pudding.\""}, {"userName": "Polly Watson", "userReviewDate": "Jul 13, 2015", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/7994885-polly-watson", "userReview": "Lee Smith truly knows how to weave a tale. There is no denying that she is a masterful storyteller. I honestly could read her stories all day. MRS. DARCY AND THE BLUE-EYED STRANGER is a book of short stories by Lee Smith, so know going in that it is NOT a novel. I, for one, really love the short story. I think that the short story is a lost art in the world today, so it is refreshing to read a book full of wonderful short stories! I can't possibly pick one to say it's my favorite. There are great qualities to each and every story. Smith's stories focus mostly on women as the main characters and/or as the narrators of her stories. Many women will more than likely relate quite easily to the women in these stories.My only complaint (please don't be mad, Lee!) is the portrayal of people of faith (religion) in Lee Smith's stories. I guess her stories are more realistic than I am aware of and it's that part that disappoints me--not Lee Smith's storytelling. As a woman of faith myself, I don't like to see people \"play\" at religion or to take it lightly or to show it in any way negative. It's probably my own personal perspective that makes me see many of the religiously focused stories in a negative light rather than it actually being that way. I know that I live in a fantasy world in so many ways. I've joked with my students when we talk about such things that I want to live in my fantasy world and they should let me live here. I LIKE believing that all the young women I know are \"perfect\" little virgin angels--and the young men, too. That they don't do drugs, drink alcohol, or disrespect their parents. I am fully aware of my fantasy world being exactly THAT--a Fantasy.Just let me live in it, ok?!"}, {"userName": "Suzanne Moore", "userReviewDate": "Jul 06, 2012", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/2127114-suzanne-moore", "userReview": "The stories in this book contain a mix of colorful characters ranging from ages 8 to 80. The common thread I found, other than their southern roots, was how they all dealt with a grim, depressing situation in a strong and uplifting way. My favorites were \u201cToastmaster\u201d where a young boy gains self-confidence and popularity after developing a stand-up comedy routine, and \u201cThe Southern Cross\u201d where the mistress of a married man, accompanying him on a boat trip, realizes his true colors and jumps ship. \u201cTongues of Fire\u201d was one of the longest short stories and also had a very intriguing character \u2026 a teenage girl who searches for spirituality and believes that denying herself of simple pleasures and practicing incessant prayer will make everything wrong turn out alright. She was also a reader whose favorite books: Little Women, The Secret Garden, and A Tree Grows in Brooklyn are all-time favorites of mine as well.

While some appear to approach a collection of stories with disdain, I find such perfect for those situations where one can perhaps steal a few minutes to read, and therefore, keep works like Lee Smith's all over the house -- a collection of short stories beside the bed, in a sitting room, the upstairs tv room, and of course, one of the most popular reading rooms in the house (the toilette).What struck me, once I finished Smith's, is that the characters, largely female, are in various stages of life and life's discoveries. What I enjoy most about her writing, aside from the female voice, is the style in which she writes -- short, simple sentences say it all in a mere few words.Well-written, enjoyable, and thought-provoking.

These are stories to be savored and I took my time reading this book. I tried to limit myself to one story a day so that I could think about and appreciate each story before dipping into the next. The stories capture individuals at various stages of life from a young boy to the Mrs. Darcy of the title who is trying to adjust to the recent loss of her husband in her own individual way. And her way, by the by, is driving her three daughters absolutely crazy.

Each story had a distinct voice, distinct southern voice, and some of them I enjoyed much more than others.

This turned out not to be the case, but even with my mistake, this book of short stories was engaging. The characters are interesting, the narratives are snappy and modern and occasionally lyrical.

She has a descriptive writing style and approach that makes her books both charming and addictive. On Agate Hill was one of my favorite southern literature pieces. However, I\u2019ve denounced my fondness of Lee Smith after reading Mrs. Darcy and the Blue-Eyed Stranger. The first few short stories were okay (kind of boring, but still enjoyable). Once I got near the end of the book to the story Stevie and Mama, here\u2019s where I had to stop. I was shocked by the blatant racism in this story. The title of the story reflects a \u201cgame\u201d that a white couple, Roxy and Willie, play during long car rides. Roxy sees Willie as a wild, reckless driver, and is frightened to ride in the car with him. Willie jokingly makes a reference that Roxy must think he\u2019s driving like a blind person. He cooks up the \u201cStevie and Mama routine,\u201d where Willie impersonates Stevie Wonder and Roxy responds back by impersonating Stevie Wonder\u2019s mother. This rendition goes back and forth for a while and is complete with the offensive use of AAVE. Here\u2019s an excerpt:\u201cYou got to hep me, Mama, I can\u2019t see a thing. I\u2019m blind, Mama. Don\u2019t you forget I\u2019m blind. Now where is that truck? I swear I jus can\u2019t see a thing out here on this highway, where is we, Mama? Where we going?\u201dI don\u2019t know Lee Smith\u2019s intention behind including this story line of the \u201cStevie and Mama routine\u201d \u2013 perhaps she was attempting to portray Roxy and Willie as (dare I say the phrase?) politically incorrect and carefree. However, regardless of her intention, she (as a white author) writing in AAVE is, in itself, racist.

The lives of ordinary, rather invisible people are brought to life and given a voice and an extraordinary one at that.Themes such as ageism and marginalization are explored from the victim\u2019s perspective such as in my favorite story, The Happy Memories Club, where an intelligent and astute resident of a retirement home is made to suffer the indignities of society\u2019s perception of our aging members by an insensitive staff as the dynamics of high school click hierarchies plays out among her peers. Her escape through her own writing is her daily salvation.In Big Girl, a young woman\u2019s fantasy husband turns out to be an insufferable louse. She makes a critical decision not to be a victim any longer, no matter her physical appearance, and tells her own story with humor and a whole lot of heart.The title story, Mrs. Darcy and The Blue-Eyed Stranger introduces us to Mrs. Darcy, an aging widow with a special gift that her three daughters cannot understand.

Lee Smith has a different style of writing, if I may say so, but I think she is very talented in her own way. I quickly pick up on her writing and I was most in love with her characters after a few stories. It was easy to relate to them, and these stories are humorous and witty and it was such a joy to read!My favorite of all would be Stevie and Mama. It was full on emotion, love, lost, sadness. It was adventurous. It made me laugh and cry, and it offers a few life lessons. I couldn't help comparing these stories to my own but I think that's the beauty of it.

There are some short stories that are brilliant, my favorites being \"Tongues of Fire\" (all about adolescence and fanatic religions -- my most cherished of topics) and \"Happy Memories Club,\" a surprisingly arresting story about a writing group at an old folks home.But there are some stories that just didn't give me enough time to get to know the characters, and they just fell flat to me, such as \"Bob, a Dog,\" \"Ultima Thule\" and the title story, \"Mrs. Darcy and the Blue-Eyed Stranger.\" I say this, mainly, to let other readers know that if they start at the beginning and don't feel drawn in quite yet, hang in there.

The thread stringing together these stories was life-changing moments when a character was inspired to choose one direction or another; to accept or not accept; to blossom or to fade away. The characters were so real to me and their choices so important that I continued reading whether I liked the story or not. I needed to know what became of these people. That is how well they were drawn. In truth, these stories had a lot of gray. Each character was flawed in some way. Maybe she drank too much, maybe he was unfaithful, maybe she was bitter, maybe he was socially awkward, but most characters felt like a neighbor or a friend.

In Toastmaster, a family's dinner outing is parsed from the point of view of a brainy 11-year-old who sees through the motivations of his flaky mother and demonstrates his powers of observation when a group of joking, drunken men enter the restaurant. Similarly, Big Girl allows an overweight wife who has sacrificed everything for her awful husband to tell her story while attaining the ultimate emancipation.Each tale is beautifully honed and captures in subtle detail and gentle irony the essential humanity of characters who might initially strike the reader as superficial or unsympathetic. House Tour, for instance, finds a cynical wife and mother contemplating her possible alcoholism when her house is overrun by an endearing group of similarly life-worn but irrepressible women who mistake her house for one on their home tour. Other tales about indomitable wives and mothers will be familiar to Smith's fans and round out this thoroughly enjoyable collection.", "title": "Mrs. Darcy and the Blue-Eyed Stranger", "url": "https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/6663248-mrs-darcy-and-the-blue-eyed-stranger", "average": 3.6, "cover": "https://images.gr-assets.com/books/1266240531l/6663248.jpg", "reviews": 145, "authors": [{"url": "https://www.goodreads.com/author/show/72932.Lee_Smith", "name": "Lee Smith"}], "type": ["Short Stories", "Fiction", "American"], "outlinks": ["http://www.goodreads.com/book/show/6663248-mrs-darcy-and-the-blue-eyed-stranger", "http://www.goodreads.com/book/show/9646329-mrs-darcy-and-the-blue-eyed-stranger", "http://www.goodreads.com/book/show/11533493-mrs-darcy-and-the-blue-eyed-stranger", "http://www.goodreads.com/book/show/199635.Fair_and_Tender_Ladies", "http://www.goodreads.com/book/show/126873.The_Last_Girls", "http://www.goodreads.com/book/show/17433973-guests-on-earth", "http://www.goodreads.com/book/show/199638.Oral_History", "http://www.goodreads.com/book/show/199636.On_Agate_Hill", "http://www.goodreads.com/book/show/39928984-mercy-among-the-children", "http://www.goodreads.com/book/show/20620995-take-me-with-you", "http://www.goodreads.com/book/show/6565401-five-quarters-of-the-orange", "http://www.goodreads.com/book/show/25600623-the-diver-s-clothes-lie-empty", "http://www.goodreads.com/book/show/18867378-the-traveler-s-gift", "http://www.goodreads.com/book/show/40198373-big-stone-gap", "http://www.goodreads.com/book/show/40198387-friendship-bread", "http://www.goodreads.com/book/show/40193401-the-little-giant-of-aberdeen-county", "http://www.goodreads.com/book/show/35963775-her-sister-s-shoes", "http://www.goodreads.com/book/show/22617980-the-rock-harbor-collection", "http://www.goodreads.com/book/show/35269080-a-thousand-tomorrows", "http://www.goodreads.com/book/show/40204902-caravans", "http://www.goodreads.com/book/show/31192689-shoeless-joe", "http://www.goodreads.com/book/show/40204877-a-hero-of-france", "http://www.goodreads.com/book/show/6473113-death-in-venice", "http://www.goodreads.com/book/show/40266651-the-tilted-world", "http://www.goodreads.com/book/show/33117501-blonde", "http://www.goodreads.com/book/show/36546758-ever-after", "http://www.goodreads.com/book/show/40193580-rescue", "http://www.goodreads.com/book/show/22032837-the-pearl-that-broke-its-shell", "http://www.goodreads.com/book/show/36589911-the-lords-of-discipline", "http://www.goodreads.com/book/show/11963271-the-sheltering-sky", "http://www.goodreads.com/book/show/25596951-the-dressmaker-s-war", "http://www.goodreads.com/book/show/35120598-gena-finn", "http://www.goodreads.com/book/show/29550710-a-charles-martin-collection", "http://www.goodreads.com/book/show/19977229-remember-tuesday-morning", "http://www.goodreads.com/book/show/8530701-a-town-like-alice", "http://www.goodreads.com/book/show/35414455-the-other-alcott", "http://www.goodreads.com/book/show/18800554-the-scavenger-s-daughters", "http://www.goodreads.com/book/show/40205036-under-the-udala-trees", "http://www.goodreads.com/book/show/32861105-the-streets-have-no-king", "http://www.goodreads.com/book/show/39929534-the-passion", "http://www.goodreads.com/book/show/35654710-this-dark-road-to-mercy", "http://www.goodreads.com/book/show/11513574-breath-eyes-memory", "http://www.goodreads.com/book/show/21942189-the-language-of-hoofbeats", "http://www.goodreads.com/book/show/18165412-house-of-bathory", "http://www.goodreads.com/book/show/37984397-we-own-the-sky", "http://www.goodreads.com/book/show/36004055-not-perfect"]}
