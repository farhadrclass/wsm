The women seemingly have nothing more to do than be mysterious or fawn over him. The story goes from point A to point B, introduces some characters who are quickly dispatched, our main character develops some nonsensical powers, he's blamed for murder, then he must run. His friends join him, along with the mysterious woman, and they flee to where? The forest. And then they go in circles and get attacked. Everyone is worried, but no one knows what to do and altogether - between cut scenes with the bad guy - I wonder what I'm reading and why I'm reading it. My buddy Jon put the question out there: Should we even finish this book? I voted yes because 1- I thought, against all hope, it might get better and 2- we couldn't legitimately warn people away from it if we didn't finish it ourselves. And, quite honestly, as I read on, I realized I had to find out how bad this book would get. It was a train wreck. All told, the group in the story did a little more wandering around, got into some nasty fights, fled, and in the end, kinda won, I think. (This is a trilogy, but there is no way you could pay me to read the rest.) I made a fickle prediction about how the book would end. One plot guess: the best buddy would bite the dust (spoiler: he did) and the second was the mysterious woman would hook back up with the fallen angel guy. After the best bud went bye bye, I started to actually pay attention. Would I go 2 for 2? It didn't look hopeful as I reached the last few pages. My lucky streak was about to be up. But the last paragraph literally had the mystery woman revealing her devious plans to reunite with her beloved fallen angel guy. I laughed hard for a good 30 seconds. I will remember the book simply b/c I guessed the contrived and unoriginal ending. This book is that bad."}, {"userName": "Raquel Leite", "userReviewDate": "Feb 26, 2013", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/5613299-raquel-leite", "userReview": "Opini\u00e3o em:https://readingssunshine.wordpress.co...O meu namorado \u00e9 completamente viciado no jogo do Diablo, ent\u00e3o eu ofereci-lhe o livro, mas\u2026 quem acabou por l\u00ea-lo fui eu (para variar).

One of the townships affected was Seram - a peaceful village whom Uldyssian ul-Diomed, a humble farmer, called home. His family was one of those affected by it, and many a missionary from the various religious sects told him that they can cure his family should he join them and believe. There was no cure. Only he and Mendeln, his brother, were left. Uldyssian became jaded and grew to loathe the sects.His trouble started the day he met Lylia, a mysterious city girl, and found in her a kindred spirit as she too felt animosity towards the sects as she had lost her family to their infighting. Not long after, several missionaries were found dead and his knife was found lodged in one of them. Being accused of the deed without a proper investigation, he starts manifesting strange powers: his cell doors unlock, the inquisitor is struck by lightning, a terrible storm starts to manifest, and an earthquake to cover their escape\u2026 All through the power of his will.He flees the village, but is followed by his brother Mendeln, his best friend Achilios, and the two girls battling for his affection, Serenthia, daughter of the town trader and the mysterious Lylia. He starts travelling towards Kehjan, where the mage guilds lie in order to find out more about his powers\u2026 his \u201cBirthright\u201d.Richard Kanaak tells a story of discovery of one\u2019s self, of love and loss\u2026 Of unrequited love, the bond of family and the burdens of leadership. This is a complex tale and builds up the characters quite nicely. This is not just a \u201chack and slash\u201d story.Now, it\u2019s been years since I last played Diablo (Hellfire to be exact), and I am very much unfamiliar with the world building that the developers have done since then, but I understand that the \u201cSin Wars\u201d Trilogy acts as some kind of prequel to the entire Diablo series. I would very much like to see how these events leads up to the original game. If it does, I would be so happy.This books isn\u2019t for minors.

Not only as a book of it's own, but as part of the Diablo's lore. It's a shame that the most important piece of lore outside the games started so bad.Full disclosure, I'm a big Diablo fan and not only I played the games since the very first one but I'm also quite fond of the game's lore. So while most just see in the games a fun hack n slash RPG, I really see a great universe and story. Having said that, this book is awful.The story feels like a bad fanfic, where the author got carried away and forgot everything that made that universe great in the first place. Characters are flat and one dimensional, the pacing is really slow, and as far as Diablo's lore goes this feels more like X-men than a gothic tale of magic.I mean...this is a universe where magic exist and is widely know. Where ancient mage clans fight each other for generations. So when a random farmer summons a storm amidst some supernatural murder, it's not much of a stretch to find reason within this universe. But the manner things unfold and how the characters react to it, it's plain idiotic both for the book's universe and the reader. (minor spoilers ahead)It just hurt my suspension of disbelief when the main characters after learning he has powers, instead of trying to figure out where it came from and how to use it and it's limitations, his first instinct is to share with others. This make no sense whatsoever! There could be the argument that he was being manipulated somehow, but even then the way it unfold through out the book is just stupid!Bad, this book is just bad.

Not sure did I get that one right! I had a little confusion with books in which order to read them. Story is okay, I don't want to spoil much. The young hero(spoiler) fights with demons lead by spoiler(again). Author tries to show us deep of love, pain, suffering, depression, pain, anger in different characters. The descriptions of different fights I can imagine in my head as player and follower of this world, but for new readers maybe it would be a little difficult. I didn't like that approach of author in this book. It kinda lacks quality in it.There are some parts where story jumps from one point on another, then it goes back to the third.

He had written a video-game inspired trilogy (i.e. WoW War of the Ancients trilogy) that was actually worth reading and entertaining so I decided to give it a try. This may not be the best of his books (do not get me started on the main female characters of this book, and how disturbingly uninteresting she is), but it is entertaining and there are some interesting Miltonian themes that redeem the book.Plot: Uldyssian, a simple farmer from the village of Seram, is mistakenly blamed for the grisly murders of two traveling missionaries. He is forced to flee his homeland with his brother and two of his dearest friends.

I started with Diablo Archive (which has 2 stories by Richard Knaak) and Moon of the Spider. I must admit that things are getting better. Although I think the characters lack some depth and that most turn of events are very predictable, the story kinda makes you want to learn more about how the world of Sanctuary first came to be and how the Nephalem changed the tides of the Eternal Conflict.The events in this book gives you a glimpse of people who will have their names remembered for thousands of Sanctuary years. Like Inarius, the prophet that created the Church of Light that later became during Diablo II the twisted Church of the Zakarum. Also some lesser demons, sons and minions of the Prime Evils. What I found most interesting was the relationships between them.Notes for parents: a light read. No swearing and small hints of sexual content.

I've been playing a lot of Diablo III and I'm a huge fan of the Diablo-series in general so I decided to tryout The Sin War novels since they're the first ones chronologically.I found the story really interesting since it takes place in a time period not seen in any of the games and long before the first Diablo game, thus there's a lot of backstory regarding the birth of the nephalem and the angels' and demons' roles in the creation of Sanctuary. You won't know most of the characters in the trilogy but there are still a few familiar faces and quite a few characters related to them which was really cool to read about. I instantly fell in love with the main characters and Knaak is doing an excellent job writing in detail about all the characters and places so that you really feel you're there.

It shows how Uldyssian goes from being a farmer to being a superpowered human on the run. I have to say that this was a good first part to the Sin War Saga. The writing was intriguing. I especially liked the way that the indivual caratchers started their journeys. The way that the action went down was a little bit too few and far between. But in this case it wasn\u2019t that bad because it let the story built up the way that it needed to. What I mean by that is that it lets it start the bridge to the next book properly. The fact that the main caratcher was able to be such a regular person who not only grows. But is able to develop into person who has the potential to turn into a great hero or villain depending on which way this series decides to go. As for the horror side of things, well I don\u2019t think that this was meant to be a straight out slasher fest. But instead a darker lord of the Rings type of book, or so it seems.

It's entertaining, especially if you take it not-too-seriously. Uldyssian is by far the silliest in my opinion, as he tries to be like a greek hero; Strong, Masculine and Clever, but also Tender, Humble and Emotional. I'm not sure whether he's silly because he fails at this, or because he succeeds and the greek heroes were just silly to begin with.

However, try to get though the first hundred pages or so, because this was a great a story.This was also my time reading anything by Knaak, and to be honest, I was not a huge fan of writing. Not bad by any means, just not a fan of his style. This may have also been why it was hard for me to get into the beginning. Again though, I greatly enjoyed this story, and it was the story being told itself that kept me reading. I am definitely going to check out the next book of the trilogy."}, {"userName": "Kamilla  Damvad", "userReviewDate": "Dec 25, 2014", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/37379615-kamilla-damvad", "userReview": "First of I have only played the newest Diablo game so this review may be effected by the fact that I do not know that much about the universe.I have given this book a total of 3 starsI thought the characters were very predictable and a bit boring at first. But as the story went on some of the characters began to get a bit more depth and I'm very much looking forward to seeing the conclusion to the struggle.But all in all the story have potential (mainly because of the setting woth angels and demons) but the story reminded me of a childrens fairytale with a bit more filling (not that that is bad, but I had expected more from it)I will be reading the next two in the series when I have a couple of spare hours.Happy reading!"}, {"userName": "Troels Rasmussen", "userReviewDate": "Apr 14, 2015", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/40712366-troels-rasmussen", "userReview": "[ The names of the main characters are references to the classical greek odyssey but I can't find other similarities in the story so it just seems strange. The story becomes very repetitive in the next couple of books, where our hero is on the brink of destruction and then he suddenly unlocks untapped power within himself again and again and again so the story never becomes exiting (hide spoiler)]"}], "description": "Since the beginning of time, the angelic forces of the High Heavens and the demonic hordes of the Burning Hells have been locked in an eternal conflict for the fate of all Creation. That struggle has now spilled over into Sanctuary -- the world of men. Determined to win mankind over to their respective causes, the forces of good and evil wage a secret war for mortal souls. This is the tale of the Sin War -- the conflict that would forever change the destiny of man.  Three thousand years before the darkening of Tristram, Uldyssian, son of Diomedes, was a simple farmer from the village of Seram. Content with his quiet, idyllic life, Uldyssian is shocked as dark events rapidly unfold around him. Mistakenly blamed for the grisly murders of two traveling missionaries, Uldyssian is forced to flee his homeland and set out on a perilous quest to redeem his good name. To his horror, he has begun to manifest strange new powers -- powers no mortal man has ever dreamed of. Now, Uldyssian must grapple with the energies building within him -- lest they consume the last vestiges of his humanity.", "title": "Birthright\n      \n          (Diablo: The Sin War #1)", "url": "http://www.goodreads.com/book/show/8178.Birthright", "average": 3.76, "cover": "https://images.gr-assets.com/books/1294496016l/8178.jpg", "reviews": 69, "authors": [{"url": "https://www.goodreads.com/author/show/5369.Richard_A_Knaak", "name": "Richard A.
