This is one of those. \"The Meeting Place\" is an example of why I've gotten so picky with the Christian fiction I read ;) I'm totally for description, and Janette Oke and T. Davis Bunn describe things so beauitfully. The story itself is unique. French and British young women meet in a meadow, and strike up a friendship. Despite the trouble between these two countries, the two women find common interests and when Louise needs help Catherine knows what she must do. I loved their husbands, Henri and Andrew. I've always loved reading things with the military, so Andrew's scenes especially interested me. I so felt for him when he had to make a hard decision that put his position in jeopardy.And the romance. It is so much deeper and real than a lot of books I read. I wouldn't hesitate giving this book to a younger teen. There is one kiss (after they are married), a few touches, but most of the book the two couples are married. Interwoven with the story and historical details, is a spiritual strain that is also deep. I just wanted to cry for Louise toward the end with everything that happened. Yet neither she, Catherine, or their husbands were angry at God. They trusted in Him even if they didn't understand everything that happened. One good Henri said was that it was man's fault that all the bad things were happening to them. He couldn't blame God. Oh, that was good!I highly, highly recommend this book. The fact that I've read it three or four times and loved it every time shows that it's a pretty good (well, don't you think?) ;)"}, {"userName": "Lindsey (Books for Christian Girls)", "userReviewDate": "Apr 22, 2015", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/19266895-lindsey-books-for-christian-girls", "userReview": "About this book:\u201cSet along the rugged coastline of 18th century Canada in what was then called Acadia (now Nova Scotia and New Brunswick), The Meeting Place re-creates a world that was home to native Indians, French settlers, and English garrisons. Such diverse populations did not live in accord, however. Instead, they were isolated within their own groups by a brewing political tension under the difficult English rule. Amid such chaotic times two women, both about to become brides and both trying to live lives of quiet peace, meet in a lush field of wildflowers. Louisa, a Frenchwoman, and Catherine, who is English, continue to meet secretly through the seasons, sharing both friendship and growing faith. The outside world does not mirror their own tranquil happiness, and the dreaded crackdown by the English throne threatens far more than their growing bond. In the face of a heart-wrenching dilemma, Louisa and Catherine strive to maintain their faith and cling to their dreams of family and home.\u201dSeries: Book #1 in the \u201cSongs of Acadia\u201d series.

This also was my first Janette Oke book! (Though I\u2019ve been watching the \u201cWhen Calls the Heart\u201d series on Hallmark, #Hearties unite! ;D ) I was a little worried at first because of the married couple being the main characters, because most married couple books have a lot of Sexual hints...it gets awkward for us unmarried, young girls (and I would think those who are married, too, but I can\u2019t speak for them) but Oh. My. Goodness. There was seriously nothing! Like, look at the Sexual Content! Can we get all \u201cnew\u201d Christian authors to do like Janette Oke?!

I started reading this just to see if I liked it or not, not really sure what I was expecting. At first, the writing was kind of slow, I thought. It was hard for me to focus on the story in the beginning, especially through a lot of the uber-poetic descriptions. I'm a character-oriented person and tend to enjoy punchier and shorter descriptions, so I was having a little bit of a hard time getting through the beginning. Let me say-- the descriptions are beautiful. Some people will absolutely love this element of the book-- and I definitely did once I understood the characters better. But it took me a while to really connect with the characters and so the descriptions in the first part seemed a bit tedious to me. But once I grew close to the characters--wow! I LOVED it! I loved the relationships and the personalities. Yes, sometimes the characters were almost too similar but I forgave that because it ties into the plot nicely. ;) My favorite character was Eli, and he's not even a main character. (He just grabbed my attention as soon as he appeared, lol...please don't die in the sequel, Eli...) I also really liked Henri. His character just really grew on me. I appreciated that the romance was not mushy, was between married couples, and was clean and unsensationalized, and I also really liked Catherine's attitude towards her husband-- her and Andrew's relationship was strong and I thought a good example. The plot is fairly quiet the first half of the book but then it gets interesting...and definitely plays on your emotions. I have a bad habit of \"acting\" out things as I read it with some books and I accidentally started doing that in the last few chapters of this book and ended up crying in a parking garage. (Just ignore me, people...)It's definitely one I'd say have the next book handy to pick up as soon as you can. ;) Thankfully my friend gave me the sequel too, lol. I almost minus-ed off half a star for the slow/descriptive beginning without feeling a strong interest/connection with the characters but decided against it. I liked it so much once I did get involved in the book that it makes up for it...and almost, if you ask me, makes the tension of the last half all the more real.

I love the characters in the book, and how well they were developed.

I have read the other books in the series, and think all of them deserve 5 stars. These books are definitely keepers! To comment on other reviews that keep comparing this book to other Oke books, it is good to keep in mind that this book was co-written with T. Davis Bunn. T.

Their villages exist side by side, yet they keep no contact because of centuries-old hostilities between their old homelands. Across the Atlantic, England and France are fighting again. The British governing forces in Acadia are forcing the French-descended Acadians to swear an oath to the King. The Acadians may be willing, had there not been a demand in the oath that they take up arms for the King. The Acadian people refuse to take up arms for France, why would they do it for England? Still, the British refuse to see that fact and view the Acadians as the cause of real or imagined problems. Into this atmosphere, an unlikely friendship is born. Catherine - a British woman - and Louise - an Acadian - meet one day in a meadow. Catherine speaks a little French, so they can communicate some. Their meetings are not frequent, not at first. But they slowly begin to grow closer. Catherine studies French again to speak better to Louise. They study the Bible together. Catherine even visits Louise's village.Catherine and her husband can see that the Acadians are not dangerous, nor are they an enemy. But sadly, no other British officials share their views. One day, it all comes to a head, as the Acadians are rounded up and sent off for other colonies - Louisiana, Charleston, New York, etc. Divided so that they can not come back together. In the midst, the unthinkable happens - children separated from their parents. Will the parents ever see their child again when they are a so far apart? I really enjoyed this story, so much so, that I read it almost in one sitting (I had a free evening). I liked how Catherine and Louise's friendship was portrayed. They seemingly have nothing in common, yet they discover that all their differences don't really matter. What bonds them most, although not the first thing, is reading the Bible together. God is what brings them the closest. They would do anything for one another, even though their heritages say they should be enemies. Another theme is that not all citizens or descendents of a certain heritage, culture, or country are enemies. The Acadians were French Huguenots (they were Protestant not Catholic) who wanted to live in peace. They so desired to be left alone, that they would not raise arms for their own \"mother country\"! Terrible things can happen when we create stereotypes and then shut our eyes to any outliers. Yes, stereotypes occur for a reason, and yes, they are usually accurate for most of a group, but, we cannot ever refuse to see that a stereotype is not all-inclusive. Sorry if I'm on soapbox here. I just liked how Oke and Bunn got across that idea without being preachy or political. It was very well done. Now I have to get the next book, because the ending was heart-wrenching!"}, {"userName": "David Gregory", "userReviewDate": "Aug 06, 2010", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/4117178-david-gregory", "userReview": "This is the first book of a five book series coauthored by Janette Oke and T. Davis Bunn. The entire series is set in the tumultous era of pre-Revolutionary War days in early America, only in this instance the setting is in Acadia, more recenly Nova Scotia.The authors set a riveting tale of two families, one Enlish and the other French, only a few miles away from each other but never meeting or relating to each other, OTHER than a meadow high up in woods where two young girls, both engaged to be married, go to find wildflowers and smell the wonderful mountain air.The girls become good friends, thanks to the ability of the English girl to speak some French, and eventually their families find out, and both families are to a degree imperiled by the discovery.In due season both young married girls are with child and give birth also to baby girls. And when one of the infants develops a life threatening condition, the love of the other mother causes her to do a very self-sacrificing thing, which has very far reaching consequences. The entire series gave my and my wife a brand new understanding of both the horrors of war, especially the unwarranted hatred of the French by the English, but even more so of the conquering power of the love of God. It also gave us knowledge of a little known but highly importance and very dramatic event in the decades preceding the Revolutionary War.

The story remains fresh and vibrant across the years since it was first published to just last night when I closed the cover on the final page.Every good story is about a relationship, a love story. Not a romance, but love. Love between friends, child and parent, a husband and wife, a love for country. \u201cThe Meeting Place\u201d has this and so much more. I am always drawn in by the depth of research that must have gone into this book, the landscape becomes another character, especially the meadow where Louise and Catherine meet. The characters in their actions, their struggles and their determination against a time that must have felt every bit as uncertain as our own, makes them extremely endearing to me. Which I think is one of the reasons I love this book, it doesn\u2019t matter that it was based three hundred years ago. It could have happened today and I can only hope to face such trials with the grace of the Robichauds and Harrows.It goes without saying that this book has more than impact, it has spirit, valor, heart wrenching moments, moments of forgiveness and crossing boundaries no one would have thought passable.

Even though they might live just a few miles apart, the English and the French people do not usually meet.

It\u2019s set in the 17th century, in \u2018Acadia\u2019 on the Canadian coast; England was at war with France, although there was an uneasy peace in the Acadian region. The novel features two women: one English, one French. They become friends and discover that despite their different backgrounds, they are at a similar stage in life.

The two groups of people did not mingle as the British were very wary of the French and did not like them since the 2 countries seemed to be constantly on the brink of war. Although the French in Acadia had never harmed anyone for decades even generations, most Brtish despised them simply because they were French.

GGRRRSome day I imagine I'll pick up the next book, but don't see it happening in the foreseeable future."}, {"userName": "Sally Wolfsberger", "userReviewDate": "Mar 18, 2017", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/47077704-sally-wolfsberger", "userReview": "One of Okes best works. The book began slowly but became one of my favorites. Looking forward to the sequel. As usual, Janette Oke does not disappoint."}, {"userName": " Mummy Cat Claire", "userReviewDate": "Aug 26, 2010", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/2648857-mummy-cat-claire", "userReview": "I enjoyed this book. The reader is introduced to two women from different countries. One is Canadian and the other is French Canadian. I love how they come together and get to know each other in their meeting place, a meadow. This series is about the conflicts with the French Canadians. I learned a lot about this issue, however it has been a while since I read this book and I feel like I should go back and read it again.Each of their lives are discussed in this first book. This information is important for the second book in the series. This author is Christian and so her books have a lot of scripture reference and God talk."}, {"userName": "Emily Barrus", "userReviewDate": "Mar 24, 2015", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/20480963-emily-barrus", "userReview": "The Meeting PlaceA bittersweet story of family and friendship during the conflict between the British and French. Louise (French) and Catherine (British) first meet in a beautiful meadow. Their friendship continues to grow, growing fond of each other and in no way thinking of the other as an enemy. They grow as close as sisters can and are joined together in their fellowship with God. Through a tragedy and when all hope seems lost, they both continue to trust in God. The book does end in a bittersweet cliffhanger. You can't put this book away without wondering what happens next! On to book #2!"}, {"userName": "Terri", "userReviewDate": "Apr 07, 2016", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/143428-terri", "userReview": "This book is an example of why I really like historical fiction: I learn stuff! I'd never heard of the Acadians or their forcible removal from Nova Scotia during the French and Indian War. My knowledge of that war was limited and only related to the American Colonial side. In this book we have two ladies (Katherine who is English and Louise who is French) who build a friendship based on common interests and similar life experiences despite language difficulties and the natural enmity between their native countries. As in all Oke novels, the characters rely firmly on God. I especially like how Oke describes them acting on inspiration and feelings they receive through prayer."}], "description": "A Chance Encounter Forever Changed Their Lives--and Destinies. Crafted by two masters of inspirational fiction--Janette Oke and T. Davis Bunn--and combining the engaging historical settings, rich characterization, and heartwarming messages quintessential to both authors, The Meeting Place is another timeless story for you to cherish.Set along the rugged coastline of 18th century Canada in what was then called Acadia (now Nova Scotia and New Brunswick), The Meeting Place re-creates a world that was home to native Indians, French settlers, and English garrisons. Such diverse populations did not live in accord, however. Instead, they were isolated within their own groups by a brewing political tension under the difficult English rule.Amid such chaotic times two women, both about to become brides and both trying to live lives of quiet peace, meet in a lush field of wildflowers. Louisa, a Frenchwoman, and Catherine, who is English, continue to meet secretly through the seasons, sharing both friendship and growing faith.The outside world does not mirror their own tranquil happiness, and the dreaded crackdown by the English throne threatens far more than their growing bond. In the face of a heart-wrenching dilemma, Louisa and Catherine strive to maintain their faith and cling to their dreams of family and home. Winner of the Christy Award, presented by the Christian Bookseller Association to honor the best in Christian fiction.", "title": "The Meeting Place\n      \n          (Song of Acadia #1)", "url": "https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/706250.The_Meeting_Place", "average": 4.06, "cover": "https://images.gr-assets.com/books/1347613763l/706250.jpg", "reviews": 196, "authors": [{"url": "https://www.goodreads.com/author/show/4049.Janette_Oke", "name": "Janette Oke"}, {"url": "https://www.goodreads.com/author/show/7584938.T_Davis_Bunn", "name": "T.
