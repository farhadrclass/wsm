This series is about two white girls and two black girls all working together to run a plantation by themselves during the post-Civil war days when racism in the south was rampant. Katie, the orphan of the plantation owners, has a warm heart and even though she is barely managing, takes in yet another young white girl to care for whose mother died and whose father is mean to her since being back from the war. The story is told by both a plantation owner's daughter and her former slave girl friend, but mostly from the slave girl's point of view. This second book is about courage to survive and has both happy and sad parts to it. Although it is the second of a series, it could also stand alone. I loved it and can't wait to read the next one of this Shenendoah Sisters series. It has interesting character development, excitement, suspense and a very good plot. It's hard to put down and I highly recommend it!(Karen's review, 5 stars)"}, {"userName": " PuMbA's MoMmy*\u2022.\u2665.\u2022* ", "userReviewDate": "Feb 08, 2012", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/4756353-pumba-s-mommy", "userReview": "What a beautiful story about friendships and remaining loyal no matter what the cost is. I enjoyed Katie & Mayme's stories. This is one series I will continue to read on. Especially because this is the 2nd book. Even though I haven\u2019t read the first one, the author did a great job picking up the pieces so a new reader wouldn't feel lost from not reading the previous story. I want to know what Mayme's family was like, what hardships they probably encountered. I want to know if Katie was close to her own mother? Did she have any siblings? I will definitely be picking up the first story soon.

After meeting another young girl named Katie, the daughter of a plantation owner, the two try to team up to run Katie's families plantation, Rosewood. There's only one catch. There's no one else is there. Soon Rosewood becomes a sanctuary for slaves who have escaped from cruel plantation owners who aren't letting their slaves go so easily. As their time increases at Rosewood, so does their risk of being discovered. Very few people in the deep south were willing to accept change after they lost the war.This adventure back in time is a realistic fiction story that I enjoyed a lot. This book is written in a way that made me feel like I was right beside Mayme and Katie as they struggled through each passing day. This is the second book in the Shenandoch Sisters series. A similar story in Cat Among the Pidgeons from the Cat Royal series. Overall, I would give this book a 4.5 out of 5 stars due to its ability to capture my imagination for so long that I was able to finish it in under 2 hours."}, {"userName": "Pam", "userReviewDate": "Mar 20, 2015", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/7884584-pam", "userReview": "A Day to Pick Your Own Cotton is a post-Civil War novel by Michael Phillips. It is book two of the Shenandoah Sisters series. It is a fantastic look the culture of the period of time after the Civil War. After the death of her Mother, what would a girl do to keep her plantation going until her father and/or brothers came back from the war? Kathleen Clairborne (Katie) and Mary Ann Jukes ( Mayme) work together to keep Katie\u2019s plantation going and to provide a home for themselves and Emma and William. Katie and Mayme have to have supplies and food so they head into town to the General Store to purchase some food on her Mother\u2019s account. Mrs. Hammond is concerned because Katie has come instead of her Mother; but gives the girls their supplies as well as a message for her Mother. Katie promises payment as soon as possible. On their way through town, they go by the livery where Henry, a free slave who knows Katie\u2019s family, introduces his son Jeremiah who had hunted him down when the slaves were freed. Katle knows she can\u2019t keep a secret from Henry for long and rushes through their time with him, declining his help to fix the reins on her horse. While picking up their supplies, they hear Mr. McSimmons looking for his slave and her baby. They know it is Emma he is looking for so they hurry home to protect her and William. Realizing they must spruce up the plantation a little and make plans for a diversion in case someone visits, they clean up the debris around the house and weed the flower garden. They arrange a basket to be carried to the clothes line to be hung up if someone comes. They set up a fire in the slave quarters to make it seem like someone is there. Will it be enough? Will the girls succeed in keeping the plantation and can they keep Emma and William safe, after all, they are only fifteen."}, {"userName": "Rebecca", "userReviewDate": "Apr 01, 2009", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/2150074-rebecca", "userReview": "Mayme Jukes and Katie Clairborne are two fifteen-year-old girls from worlds apart -- Mayme was born into slavery, while Katie was the daughter of a wealthy family that owned a large plantation. But in the final days of the Civil War, they both lost their families to marauders, and now they share an important secret. After Mayme, fleeing the scene of her family's murders, came across Katie, the only survivor at her plantation, Rosewood, the two girls decided to live there on their own and pretend that Katie's mother is still alive. As if that were not difficult enough, now they must protect three other people as well. Emma, a former slave, and her baby, William, are hiding at Rosewood from William's father, the son of Emma's former master. And Aleta, a young girl whose mother died as they fled from her abusive father, is living at Rosewood and is determined to never return home. Mayme and Katie have other worries as well. A loan is due soon at the bank, and if they don't pay, they will never be able to protect their secret. This was a good sequel to \"Angels Watching Over Me\" that continues the story of Mayme and Katie, and introduces some new characters as well. I really enjoyed the first book, and this was an excellent sequel. It brings to life the dangers of the post-Civil War South and is a heartwarming story of friendship. I really came to care about the characters. I recommend these books to teens and adults who like historical fiction about this time period. I look forward to reading the other two books in this series and find out what happens next."}, {"userName": "Yvonne", "userReviewDate": "Aug 02, 2015", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/25256694-yvonne", "userReview": "I started to give this book one star but I decided on two because I did have to finish it to believe it was as bad as it was. I did not care for this book because it was too contrived and many of the \"adventures\" were just ridiculous. The idea that two young girls could carry out the plans laid out by the author are completely unreasonable. The neighbors and townspeople never thought to check on Katie's mother when she stopped appearing in town and/or question why she was never at home when people stopped by...really??? Plus, NOBODY noticed that Miss Katie had blisters on her hands and her complexion would have hardened because of the hard, manual labor of tending the plantation.  The fact that Mayme, now a Free Black spoke with correct English narrating the novel, contrasts with every other Black person in the novel that speaks in an unfortunate representation of Negro dialect. Also, It is unlikely that Emma, the HOUSE slave, would have a worse pronunciation of English than Mayme who was a FIELD slave. Katie burying Aleta's mother, Katie driving the cotton bales to market, and Katie riding through town with Jeremiah behind her are unbelievable incidents that made me cringe while trying to finish this book. Normally I would stop reading a book after the main characters fail to spark my interest but I kept reading this book because I couldn't put it down, the situations kept spiraling downward until the unsatisfying conclusion...to be continued.

By now, I was very put off by the language of the plantation slave, Maymee, vs. the 'half-wit' house slave, Emma. She fed William, \"An' den he went ter sleep . . . I thought you was never gwine get back.\"Mayme goes back to her old plantation, then on into town. She can read all the town signs, including one for work. In two months. Oh well. Then Aleta shows up. She's \"8 or 9\", an orphan, and prejudiced, but under Katie's tutelage she changes.

So much suspense, you want to read more. The plot of this story of four girls from different backgrounds and ethnicity, now share a common lifestyle and story through the hardship of life. The most fascinating of these girls, is that they'll soon begin to share the power of one God. Already, they've begun seeing his mighty love around them especially Mayme and Katie. Their determination to keep the plantation is such an example everyone should follow. They read, prayed, listened and learnt. I also like the way the writer writes the story from the eyes of a slave girl who has known nothing but pain and hardship and in place of hatred, love takes over and the love in her heart saves her from death. I can keep going on and on... It is however sad that many people today still look at the skin colour to judge a person's behaviour, I think people like that need to read this book. And I am sure the next in the series: the colour of your skin ain't the colour of your heart, will put things in better perspective of how we all need and give love to survive."}, {"userName": "Marilyn", "userReviewDate": "Apr 08, 2010", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/1844330-marilyn", "userReview": "Katie (15) and Mayme (16) are forced to grow up quickly after being orphaned by the Civil War.
