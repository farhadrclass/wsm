I have really enjoyed this series. However, if you have not read books one and two, don\u2019t worry, A Dream of Miracles stands alone very nicely.In some ways, this was a tough book to read. I didn\u2019t want to set it down because I was so invested in the trials that Mattie Diener was experiencing, yet it was hard to see her being so unfairly treated. This one really pulled on my heartstrings.The author did a good job of showing the disparity between the Amish and the Englisch, particularly with the Englisch doctors, nurses, and social workers who did not understand many of Mattie\u2019s beliefs.Bo Lambright was a great character. I really loved watching him discern what was right and what was not. Then, there were moments of self-doubt that he had to deal with. That made him very human. I liked the way he trusted in God\u2019s guidance in the face of opposition.I thought that this was a creative and different Amish story and recommend it to Amish fiction fans.I received a complimentary copy of this book in exchange for an honest review.You can read this review on my blog at:https://brittreadsfiction.wordpress.c..."}, {"userName": "Julia Wilson", "userReviewDate": "Mar 13, 2016", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/29770295-julia-wilson", "userReview": "A Dream For Miracles by Ruth Reid is book three in the Amish Wonders series but can be read as a stand-alone.There is a season for everything but sometimes only when looking back does life make sense. Ruth Reid shows how important it is to listen to God and to obey His leadings. Whatever hardship one is going through, God walks alongside us.The novel demonstrates the power of dreams. Sometimes God speaks to us in our dreams and it is vital that we recognise His voice. The dreams may only make sense when viewed backwards. This reminds the reader that God spoke to Joseph in his dreams, as told in Genesis.Young widow of eighteen months Mattie has been trying to pretend that everything is ok to her Amish community. In her grief, Mattie has lost sight of God and constantly asks if He is there. God has never left Mattie but her immersion in her grief has hidden Him.Faith in God is a huge theme within the novel. Mattie has faith in God even though she is struggling. However she is under the misapprehension that faith in God should prevent the bad things from happening. Mattie thinks that her faith must be too small if bad stuff is happening, but that is just life. As the Bible says one only needs faith the size of a mustard seed in order to tell a mountain to move.Within the novel there is the motif of a little lamb failing to thrive, who is lovingly cared for by Mattie. The lamb is hand reared and even bought into the kitchen to be looked after. This reminds the reader of how God looks after us. He has His eye on each and every one of us, and He nourishes us with His love. We are His flock of sheep and He will notice any of us who are failing to thrive.Bo who works for Children's Services believes in God and the power of prayer. His path crosses Mattie's and he helps her to see that where two or three are gathered in prayer, the Lord is there too. Prayer is powerful. God hears our prayers and He always answers, just not always in the way we want.The novel deals with the tough subject of separating a mother from her children. It explores the foster system. It shows the frustration of the innocent battling against a system that believes the worst of them.There is a huge chasm between the Amish and Englischer way of life. The Englischer's do not always understand or respect the Amish and are viewed with suspicion.The novel explores the bond between a mother and her children. The reader sees it with Mattie and her two young children, and also with Bo and his mother. A mother's bond of love is seen to be very powerful.Ruth Reid drew some absolutely delightful characters. Mattie was easy to empathise with as she loved her children unconditionally. Bo, with his heart for the lost and hurting was a worthy main male character. The small children bought out the mothering instinct in me and I could empathise when one of the character's was diagnosed with ITP, as I had been there when our son was diagnosed with that. The characters were all very likeable.I absolutely loved A Dream For Miracles. It is the first book that I have read by Ruth Reid but I shall be hunting out more. I greedily devoured the book in just two sessions. Give yourself a treat and escape to a world where the Amish and Englisch worlds collide.I received this book for free in exchange for a fair and honest review.

A Dream of Miracles ranks among the best books I\u2019ve read, Amish or otherwise. There\u2019s a different element to Ruth Reid\u2019s writing, and A Dream of Miracles breaks the boundaries of Amish fiction wide open, capturing me from page one with its emotional pull and character depth. Ruth writes with knowledge and authority when it comes to the Amish and healthcare, drawing from her wealth of experience in this industry. Most people are referring to suspense when they say that they couldn\u2019t put a book down, but that\u2019s exactly how I felt about this story, for the emotional suspense of relationship drama is what hooks me every time.The Badger Creek community of Michigan\u2019s Upper Peninsula area provides a wonderful backdrop for this story and Ruth conveys its beauty vividly. I had to search for a picture of the lighthouse Bo saw while out in his boat on Lake Superior, the Grand Island Lighthouse. Beautiful! And wooden - how unique.Englisch and Amish worlds harshly collide as Mattie becomes the target of a Child and Family Services investigation, and the chasm between these two worlds becomes glaringly apparent. We see a lack of knowledge about the Amish, judgmental attitudes, and no desire to learn more. Themes explore the bond between mother and child \u2013 not only Mattie and her children, but Bo and his mother as well \u2013 foster care, removing children from the home, and clinging to faith when life makes no sense.As a mother, connecting with Mattie and her struggles was immediate. And Bo is such an appealing character, with his heart for those who are hurting and his drive to do the right thing rather than merely follow procedure. One secondary theme that I found especially touching was Mattie\u2019s caregiving of a little lamb that wasn\u2019t thriving. What beautiful imagery of the Good Shepherd who watches over and protects us!I love this quote because it captures the spiritual essence of A Dream of Miracles so perfectly and is something I never want to forget: \"Be strong. Be still. Be faithful. God is in control.\" Ruth expressed her goal for readers in a Litfuse interview and this is exactly how I felt throughout the story: \u201cMy goal is that readers will feel the presence of God. His love, His grace, His mercy, and the miraculous ways He guides us in our daily lives.\u201dRuth Reid is a \u201cnot to be missed\u201d author for me and A Dream of Miracles goes on my favorites list. Highly recommended to all readers.Click on the title, A Miracle of Hope, to see my review of the first book in this series."}, {"userName": "Deana Dick", "userReviewDate": "Apr 12, 2016", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/6244880-deana-dick", "userReview": "Right from the beginning I could tell this was going to be a bit different type of Amish story. Mattie is a widow raising her two small children as best she can. Her character is almost innocent like. She has deep love for her children and her faith. When her son becomes sick , she takes him to the doctor and that is when her nightmare begins. She is seen by another doctor instead of the doctor that always looks after her children when they are ill. The doctor is not very friendly and seems almost abrupt at times. I didn't care for her at all. It seems like she had her mind made up within minutes that the boy was being abused. The boy is admitted to the hospital with severe injuries . Almost immediately CPS is called in and Mattie begins to get scared. She knows she hasn't done anything wrong. Her emotions were so deep, I could feel her heart breaking. The story is well written and I found myself not being able to put the book down. Will she lose both her children to the system? Mattie will meet a man called Boaz Lambright who has been assigned to investigate Mattie and her children. Can Bo get Mattie to trust him? Why can Bo understand Pennsylvania Dutch so well? Is there a secret in his past that could explain why he feels comfortable around the Amish? I loved his character so much. The author wrote him with such compassion and not giving up. He is determined to find out the truth and believes Mattie is innocent. Will Nathan, Mattie's son survive ? Where did the bruises come from on his little body? Mattie is a devoted mom and her unconditional love for them is well written in the story. I at times wanted to sit by her and gently hold her hand and reassure her that God has this under control. The story is riveting and her neighbors join together to try to help Mattie get her children back. Bo is drawn to Mattie and even though his job is in jeopardy , he believe she needs his help. I loved the author showing Bo and God talking. That was such an intimate time and I loved how she wrote it with pureness and grace. This is one story that will stay with you long after the last page is written. The story captures trust, unconditional love, forgiveness , and faith in a beautiful inspiring story. I highly recommend this book to fans of Amish books and anyone looking for a book that shows that God is always there in our darkest moment holding our hand. This book has shown me not to ever give up. He is always there and He will guide you in the right direction. He is our justifier and makes miracles happen everyday. Never cease praying for a miracle.

Thank God the numbers are very few among the Amish and we know what the numbers are like in our world with this same topic.I was on the edge of my seat reading \"A Dream of Miracles\". My socks were blown off of my feet, that's how powerful this story is. I was feeling for Mattie Diener and her two children and the experiences they were going through. I love when an author can draw my mind into their story that they've written. \"A Dream of Miracles\" has got to be my all time favorite book written by Ruth Reid. I have read all of her Amish genre books so far.

Now Mattie is having a rough time even with all the help the community is offering along with working on her herb and honey business. When her oldest son, who is three, gets severely sick the case baffles the doctors so much their original diagnosis calls in CPS workers. In a short amount of time, Mattie loses her kids to the system and she is arrested.While that is happening, Bo, the case worker, is trying to help her through the hoops and closing out the case because a more viable diagnosis comes to the doctor\u2019s attention. Just as she starts to get her life back to normal literally her whole world collapses again and this time it is a grave matter.What comes to light about Bo\u2019s past, I cannot share because it would spoil the enjoyment for readers to know. All I can say is WOW! The strength of Mattie\u2019s character is under the microscope of strangers, and her faith is wobbly as is her health. Bo is not the enemy she thinks he is at first. In fact, he becomes more entangled with Mattie\u2019s life including their hearts.Ruth Reid writes novels that are clean, suspense filled and realistic in what some of the Amish like Englishers have to deal with in the world. The author makes them seem like real people and doesn\u2019t elevate them to unrealistic status nor do her stories make their life seem better than someone else\u2019s. I appreciate that quality in Amish books as sometimes the Amish or Mennonite people are lifted up to be looked upon as almost godlike status instead of the flesh and blood that they are.I hope you read all three novels in the series: A Miracle of Hope, A Woodland Miracle and finally A Dream of Miracles.

Mattie is a widow who is trying to keep all the threads of life weaving forward along this journey as a single mother. She is strong in faith. She might not know the ways of the world, but she knows what she must do when the authorities are threatening to take her children away. No matter what people think, Mattie is a wonderful mother. She has done no wrong, and her strength will be found in trusting God, her faith in His word, and maybe... just maybe the compassion and guidance from Bo.Doctor Wellington is filling in for Doctor Roswell. Not only will Doctor Wellington misdiagnose Nathan's symptoms, but she will open the door for an investigation into Mattie's ability to care for her children.Bo Lambright is the CPS investigator called to Community Memorial. He is a man whose observations are accurate and who has compassion for all of those involved in his cases. He understands and knows the ways of the Amish and isn't convinced that Mattie has done anything to endanger her children. This investigation will lead Bo beyond his typical involvement and he will need to call in some assistance from Judge Nettleton. Will his \"bending of the rules\" cost him his career? Will his determination to help Mattie lead to a trial?Erica Davis is on her first field assignment and thinks she is as qualified as Bo. She is determined to climb the ladder and unfortunately has a wealth of high profile connections. What she doesn't have is the background information about the Amish, nor the experience as a skilled observer. Her involvement will place Mattie in the mode to flee with her children.Judge Nettleton is Bo's mother. Even with a political career in the making, she will be led to make a decision to trust Bo's observations.

A Dream of Miracles by Ruth Reid is very different than other Amish fiction I've read in the past. Even if the storyline combines Amish and Englisch cultures and how they differ and how they coexist in society, this one speaks to one's compassion and righteousness more than I've imagined. I couldn't believe the ignorance that Englischers, especially those in the medical and government services, have towards Amish's way of life. A medical practice that have administered to the Amish community should have some inkling as to their beliefs and practices and not jumped to the conclusion that our main lead, Mattie have something to hide. As to the government services, when the Children Protection Services were called, some were plain rude, but granted, they did have ulterior motives. As you can already tell, I was very engrossed in this novel. The injustice of it all, had me riled up and hoping that things will get better.Many of my highlighted quotes have potential spoilers, and some were beautiful prayers to the Lord. The time Boaz (Bo) and Mattie spent together was turbulent to say the least with the accusations and threat to take Mattie's kids from her care, yet the many sweet moments they share together gives readers a great comfort, just as it does Mattie.\"Mattie's face heated. A handsome man hadn't winked at her in years - and an Englisch man at that. Bo Lambright had not only charmed her daughter, he'd charmed her.\" (243)With Mattie, her struggles includes the environmental aspect happening with CPS and the health of her children. With Bo, his development has more to do with past hurts and the need to find peace with it. I love the message of time, a reason for everything and how God plants people and situations in your path for a specific reason. A captivating story to behold, and one that I wish there was more, at least a little epilogue. Either way, I'm looking forward to going back and reading Ruth's other works, specifically those from earlier in the series.This review first appeared on Just Commonly blog.NOTE: I received a complimentary copy of this book through Litfuse Publicity Tours for an honest review.

A young Amish widow and mother of two young children, she faces the lingering heartbreak of lost love, her son\u2019s mysterious illness, and a torrent of accusations that threaten to undo her.Bo Lambright is a fast-rising social services investigator whose high-society mother won\u2019t rest until she finds his Mrs. Right.

Is a miracle possible\u2014not only of healing but of forbidden love? What secrets lie in Bo\u2019s dreams? And will Mattie find the courage to face her uncertain future . . . or will she simply run away?I think Ms. Reid has given us a highly complicated story plot. Mattie Diener is, definitely, having a tough life\u2013from both sides of the fence. She is holding it together but it is certainly not easy. I was quite impressed with the way Mattie and Bo meet each other and then have to work out their differences to work together.

When I received a copy of this book to review I began reading with an open mind. I must say the author completely blew me away with the story and her storytelling. This isn't your typical Amish fiction. This story is the powerful telling of a sick child and his mother's fight to save him and her family when faced with the involvement of CPS. I found the story to be quite intense at times and had to put the book down for just a minute to catch my breath and process what was happening. I found though that I could only put the book down for a bit before I had to start reading again to find out what was happening to these characters. This book captivated me from page one and kept me totally involved until the last page. The author did an awesome job with the characters. It was easy to empathize with Mattie and like Bo at the same time. These characters were complex and felt real to me from the moment I met them. The supporting characters were just as well developed and added to the story. The author did a wonderful job in conveying the differences between the Amish and the English world when it comes to health care and the beliefs of each group. Her background in the pharmaceutical field really comes through in all the details of the medical issues. This really added another layer of believability for me and made me enjoy the book even more.I highly recommend this book!

Mattie Diener was raising her two young children along, after she lost her husband. It was when Mattie's son became ill that her life took another drastic change. The Dr. on call was not Mattie's regular Dr., didn't know Mattie at all, and apparently wanted to make a name for herself, because she accused Mattie of abusing her children. How horrible for this young widow mother that loved her kids. And then there was Social worker Bo Lambright. Is there anything Bo can do to help Mattie. Does he believe what she is telling everyone?My heart went out to Mattie, what a terrible thing this Dr. put her through. But the problem was the effects on her son's illness and the reactions he was having. When Bo started investigating, something was different about Mattie than most people he had to deal with. Even though his job was to make sure the children were safe, he didn't thing Mattie abused her kids. Tension was sure running wild throughout this book.

Most often they take children that don't need taken and the ones that do they dont. I wound up crying through most of this but found some joy also.

Her life feels that it will never be right side up again! I think the one thing that resonated with me more than anything was her worrying about her son's condition and still not having any answers. We as women have to trust the medical professionals to do their job and do it well and in Mattie's story they weren't quite doing their job to set her mind at ease and that really bothered me. I myself have been in several similar situations with my own children and it was heart breaking to go through not to mention to watch it in Ruth Reid's latest. Judging by Ruth's writing she herself must have had to go through a similar situation because in my opinion she was able to get the writing perfect right down to the feelings that something like this would cause in a mother of a young child or any age child for that matter. Mattie has also shut herself off to ever loving again. But when a certain stranger crosses her path he not only pricks her heart with a slight twinge but also gets her to thinking on love once again. This book reminds me of a star crossed lovers type romance. But with it's simplicity and clean lines it is a great novel with the best scenes and writings. Ruth Reid has a winner!**Disclosure** This book was sent to me free of charge for my honest review from the author."}, {"userName": "Debi Lantzer", "userReviewDate": "May 26, 2016", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/35280639-debi-lantzer", "userReview": "A Dream of Miracles is the third book in The Amish Wonder series by Ruth Reid. The first book was A Miracle of Hope and the second book was A Woodland Miracle. Each of those books would probably have helped in creating the backdrop to the characters in this book, but nonetheless, my favorite Amish book reviewer, Gloria (aka Mom) says that this book can be read as a stand alone very nicely.This story takes place in a small community made up of Old Order Amish in Michigan. The two main characters Mattie Diener and Boaz (Bo) Lambright become so real that you think they are your best friends. Mattie is a young widowed woman with two young children, Nathan and 18-month old Amanda, to raise without her husband Andy, who is deceased. Mattie is having a rough time running a herb and honey business with the help of the community especially her next door bachelor neighbor Alvin.Mattie\u2019s oldest child, Nathan, is three years old has been a sickly baby with several health issues since his birth. Nathan is ill and Mattie takes him to the doctor and her worse nightmare begins. Her regular doctor is not available and another doctor, Dr. Wellington, is filling his place but he knows nothing about the Amish. Nathan has a fever and blisters in his mouth and Dr. Wellington suspects\u2019 abuse.The doctor has Mattie take Nathan to the hospital and calls Child Protective Services on her. She meets Boaz Lambright, a fast-rising social services investigator whose high-society mother doesn't seem to rest until she finds her son's \"Mrs. Right\". He does not think there is any abuse and sets out to prove her innocence. Things keep happening and the plot continues to twist and turn, and all the while Mattie has your heart because of struggles she is going through. Bo was haunted by dreams with flashing from his current life into his past life.I love the twist that Bo experiences and I found it hard to actually put this book down because I wanted to find out the outcome. There is so much emotion in this story and both the characters and the plot are so powerful that it just carried me away with them. Toward the end of this story things are explained. I loved this story and I look forward to other books by Ruth Reid.I received a paperback copy of this book without cost from the publisher through The Fiction Guild, a Thomas Nelson/Zondervan book review bloggers program. I was not required to write a positive review.

I really felt so sorry for Mattie and then Bo\u2019s heart is so huge for her as well. As the story goes on, it just gets worse for Mattie and her children and my heart just went out to them.

My own child's diagnosis is a rare medical diagnosis that is a mystery to many. My heart skipped beats while reading this because when my child started having health issues I was so scared of someone misunderstanding my family and my heart just broke for Mattie.\u00a0The characters in this story are so well written and developed. I connected with them on a personal level and I really couldn't put this book down! I devoured this during one of my daughter's therapy sessions and sat with huge tears rolling down my face and hoping no one else walked into the waiting room.\u00a0 I am sure the therapists were giving me some weird glances when they brought my kids back because they asked me if I was alright. I must have been a sight!I think this book is a book that any special needs mom can relate to on some level even if it did cause me a little anxiety.\u00a0\u00a0 I was so happy with the outcome though because at one point I really didn't understand how it was all going to come together and the author pulled it together so beautifully.\u00a0\u00a0 I didn't think this author could get any better (because I adore her books) but she sure has.\u00a0 This series has been a hit right after the other but this one was my favorite!I have had the pleasure of reading this author since the release of her debut novel and she's grown by leaps and bounds as a published author.

Mattie Diener's son, Nathan is ill. He has been plagued by illness since his birth. She takes him to the doctor, but the regular doctor (Dr. Roswell) is on vacation. Dr. Wellington is filling in, but she knows nothing about the Amish (like how long it takes in a buggy to get to the hospital). Nathan has blisters in his mouth and the doctor suspects foul play. She has Mattie take him to the hospital and calls Child Protective Services (since it took her three hours to get to the hospital). Bo Lampbright is the caseworker assigned to the Diener case. Bo is attracted to Mattie from the moment they meet. The hospital, though, does not seem to understand the Amish (their culture). This is just the beginning of trouble for Mattie. Mattie does not understand how the system works (with the police and Child Protective Services) and is overwhelmed. It is hard enough that her husband passed away eighteen months ago and Mattie has two young children. Things go from bad to worse. Bo believes in Mattie and will do anything he can to help her (including risking his career). Join us in A Dream of Miracles to see how Mattie handles her crisis of faith and the system!A Dream of Miracles is well-written (and easy to read), but I had a hard time liking the main character, Mattie. It is hard to believe in this day and age that anyone her age (she is twenty-eight) can be that ignorant (of the government and its processes, life in general). Ignorance is not bliss especially in this case. I just found the book upsetting (about Mattie, the system, and the secrets) instead of enjoyable. A Dream of Miracles does show how people will put their own agenda ahead of the welfare of others as well as how ignorant people can be of other cultures and their beliefs. I give A Dream of Miracles 3.75 out of 5 stars.

I have not read the other two novels in the series, but had no trouble following along. Although, after reading A Dream of Miracles I plan on going back and read the other two!Mattie Diener has recently become a widow. Left alone to care for her two young children, Nathan and Amanda, she is doing the best she can. When Nathan gets sick and her home remedies don't help, she does the only thing she knows to do, she carries him to a local doctor they've seen before. Unfortunately, said doctor is on vacation, and she's forced to deal with a new doctor who is filling in.Doctor Wellington doesn't seem to care for the Amish too much. She becomes immediately suspicious of Mattie when she notices blisters in Nathan's mouth. She doens't seem to care for the way Mattie coddles her children or speaks to them in Pennsylvania Deitsch. She admits Nathan to the hospital with little or no explanation and when it takes Mattie three hours to get him there she calls Child Protective Services to investiagate.Bo Lambright is the investigator called to Mattie Diener's case. Something strikes him as odd from the get go. The hospital staff, as well as the doctor, seem ignorant to the Amish way and their beliefs. He knows in his gut that Mattie has done nothing to harm her children but he just has to prove it, even if all the evidencce seems to prove otherwise.It will take a miracle to straighten all this out. Evidence seems to be mounting against Mattie even though she did nothing wrong. Bo is so sure of her innocence he's staked his reputation on her being cleared of charges. His partner, Erica Davis, seems inten to bury Mattie under the jail even though this is her first case and Mattie has never been accused of abuse before.A Dream of Miracles is an enthralling story that will keep you in suspense until the very end.

A Dream of Miracles is just one of those books. The characters in this book are compelling and complex, they are the kind of people you'd expect to meet in your day to day activities, yet they also have such endearing qualities that inspire you to be a better person. I love Bo Lambright's story. His love for forgotten children and his kindness towards others is so apparent right from page one. As a social worker, Bo often sees some hard cases and deals with some heart wrenching situations, yet his love for children, his devotion to his work and his calling from God is what keeps him going. Despite his difficult past that includes a bad car crash, abandonment from his dad and leaving an Amish community, Bo moves forward with a good head on his shoulders and a heart of gold. It only seems natural that when Maddie Diener's case, an Amish woman who is falsely accused of child abuse crosses his path, Bo feels God's call to help this woman and her children. In the process Bo and Maddie find much more than the two of them could ever have hoped or asked for, but will they learn to trust each other, open up their hearts to love, and above all else, trust God in the process?Reid has crafted such an amazing story of love, forgiveness, trust and hope.

Although expected, the romance was not typical of many novels in this genre.Characters are well-rounded and gained my sympathy and support from the beginning. Situations within the plot were realistic with disturbing insight into what can happen to innocent people when their rights are sacrificed to meet another\u2019s selfish agenda.Talk about circumstantial evidence! When young Amish widow Mattie\u2019s young son is hospitalized with critical symptoms, everything points to Mattie. At best, she appears to neglect her children \u2013 at worst, she has abused her son to the point of death. When Bo Lambright is sent to investigate her case, his instincts tell him she is innocent. His choices in the case could destroy his career as well as Mattie\u2019s life. Frequent disturbing dreams and Mattie\u2019s case force Bo to confront and make peace with his own past. Is there any future for an up-and-coming social services investigator and an Amish widow?I can truthfully say that I enjoyed \u201cA Dream of Miracles\u201d. The story moved along at a good pace and it was a good sign that I found myself frustrated over the circumstances surrounding Bo and Mattie.

They felt incomplete by the end of the book. The ending also, was interesting but I have to admit did leave me wanting for more. Of course, in turn it makes me wonder if there is to be a sequel written to this book. Found that I did enjoy the way the story was written, and did find myself eager to find out the ending. But the further I read into the book, I was left with questions about certain situations and wishing I could ask Mattie what on earth was going on. And then there was Bo, who was haunted by dreams he had. Towards the end of the book things are explained, but to me, not completely. I still don't understand how his current life melded into his past life, unless it said so somewhere in between the pages and I missed it.All in all, I did enjoy the book and really did wonder how it would all end, despite the areas of slight confusion.
