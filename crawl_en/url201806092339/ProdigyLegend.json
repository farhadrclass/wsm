Here I am yet again eating my words. A year ago, when I read Legend, I complained about the world building. Mind you, I did think it was a fast-paced, exciting read, but it felt incomplete as a dystopian novel because I couldn't fully visualize how the society fit into the world as a whole. By the end, I was left with so many questions about how everything functioned. I felt like Marie Lu was purposefully keeping secrets from me just to string me along to book two. Well, I supposed it did work and to my immense delight, it was well worth the wait. And I loved it.Instantly, I noticed a change from Legend to Prodigy. The biggest being the change in my opinion over the two main characters June and Day. Originally, June and I didn't mesh well, but in Prodigy that situation was flipped. It was Day that was the new thorn in my side for the majority of the book. From the beginning, June warns Day of the Patriots and their leader, Razor, but Day, blinded by his hatred of the Republic for destroying his family, fails to heed her warning. A part of this is due to doubt of June's loyalty being placed in his head from other Patriots and his best friend, Tess, who is not ashamed to show her dislike for June. And just when I thought I had it up to *here* with him, he wised up and took action. The \"old\" Day that warmed my heart in Legend was back.June, on the other hand, I liked very much. I thought her character growth was a vast improvement from Legend because she's clearly learned from past actions. In Prodigy, she is more aware of the corruption in the Republic and is therefore able to pinpoint wary situations. Yet, the thing she struggles with the most in this sequel are her feelings for Day and how their relationship could possibly work out given their backgrounds. Can they remain together even with the knowledge that June's actions in Legend resulted in the murdering of his family? Are they simply too different for it to work being from opposite economic classes? And then there's Anden, the new Elector Primo, whose interest in June was shown in Legend and apparently still holding firm. Wouldn't it just be easier to be with someone like him? That's the predicament June finds herself in. And while it may sound rather angsty the way I've described it, I never felt it was overdone to the point of instant \"headdesk-ation.\"Another improvement was the world building. And with that, I'm now wondering if I'm often too hard on first books in dystopians. I'm noticing a trend with world building becoming more pronounced in the second books in series when I usually prefer some sort of set-up to the story. (Perhaps this is just my high-fantasy mind kicking into gear.) But everything came together nicely here. We found out how the country was split into two separate ones. We find out how the outside world views the Republic. We find out what's going on in the Colonies (though, I would have loved to hear more about them). Sure, I would have loved to know a little of this during Legend, but I have to say, I've enjoyed the ride thus far.Finally, there's the ending, which I will warn other readers, does end in a rather disturbing cliffhanger. *sniff* In my Legend review, I complained about the illusion of Day and June's invincibility. N-n-not so in Prodigy. *hiccup*\nOkay, okay. I admit it. I was a teensy bit emotional. But only for, like, five seconds (plus an hour or two...maybe...).\u00a0And now I'm secretly cursing myself for ever complaining in the first place. Why? WHY?! WHY?! OH, GOD. WHY, DO AUTHORS KEEP DESTROYING MY FEELINGS?!\u00a0First, I was in a bit of shock. Marie Lu wouldn't do that to me. I mean, she had built up the anticipation perfectly throughout the entire novel. I thought ALL THE THINGS were going to be okie-dokie.\u00a0\n*We interrupt your regularly scheduled review for a moment of angst*\n\n\n/end *moment of angst*\n(Er... Sorry, that was weird.)So then when I finished the book and was LEFT ON THE BLOODY CLIFF, I was like, \"Marie... no.... you, evil genius... no...\" So basically, Marie Lu has me hook, line and sinker. I'm completely enthralled in this series and I can't wait to see what happens next.Big thank you to Anna from Literary Exploration for lending me her ARC!\u00a0More reviews and other fantastical things at Cuddlebuggery.com."}, {"userName": "Emily May", "userReviewDate": "Sep 19, 2012", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/4622890-emily-may", "userReview": "[She can't actually kill him, right? *sob* She better not.

When you imagine the fall of the US as a democracy, what kind of state do you think will emerge? I imagine one of two options are most likely. 1) A fascist surveillance state - nothing is private, nothing is your choice, your every move is strictly directed and monitored by a governing force (possibly the military). Very little personal freedom. 2) A state ruled by money - as David Mitchell calls it in Cloud Atlas, a corporacracy. Every part of your life is determined by your economic standing; free social service is nonexistent. Freedom based on income. My point: Prodigy was an interesting read for me because it depicts the US falling into ruin, then splitting into two halves, each spiraling down to become one of the options above. The Republic = Option OneThe Colonies = Option TwoThere's some food for thought. Perhaps Marie Lu shares my views on the fall of the US. I didn't mention this in my review of Legend because the dystopian world of the series wasn't explained and expanded until Book 2. The worldbuilding I missed in the first book was delivered in Prodigy, which was a relief. I couldn't give Prodigy a full five stars because of LOVE TRIANGLES. UGH.Not one but TWO new love triangles are established in this book and it pisses me off. Not because it was unrealistic; people fall in love in inconvenient ways all the time so that was definitely believable. What I can't stand is when authors turn perfectly kind and lovable people into complete dicks for the sake of resolving a love triangle conflict. Ever read the Shatter Me series? Think about Adam's transformation and you'll know what I mean. So Tess, a lovely girl with great prospects and an admirable PLATONIC relationship with Day, all of a sudden falls for him and turns into a raging asshat. This is not okay! Slow-building character development/deterioration: that's reasonable. Total 180s out of nowhere: NOPE. Stop that shit. Aside from that... Though the plot was a bit slow, the unveiling of the Republic's inner workings and the glimpse at the Colonies made up for it. I enjoyed Prodigy nearly as much, if not just as much, as Legend."}, {"userName": "Rimsha Salam", "userReviewDate": "Aug 09, 2012", "userURL":

gets more logical and mature this time from both Day and June..The struggle between them due to their different background, and their past life... how it was totally different that they should have been enemies.Yet they knew now the real enemy...but more deceptions were in store for them.I don't mind much their age (as in book one's case) since it didn't been mentioned more here. And also because they were acting much better and mature this time.The Ending--------Without spoiler... I feel this is very old drama type.. I watched some black and white movies with this same events.Yet.. Since I loved the characters now, and loved the story which kept me breathless most of the time.. and the brilliant idea, I just loved the ending , soup opera quality but that's fine.And (again unlike book one) this ending is a perfect \"book end\", you know... I mean of course it will keep me wanting to start the next book ASAP, Yet it's a satisfying book ending. Not just a chapter ending as previous book.So Marie Lu, that was brilliant I wish many YA author know how to make their stories full of meaning, related to our world, with action mixed with good drama and reasonable romance, and as fast paced as this one..Mohammed ArabeyFrom 15 August 2017To 19 August 2017(About 3 years after reading the 1st book..and now I'm shamed I waited that long)"}, {"userName": "Sasha Alsberg", "userReviewDate": "Feb 19, 2013", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/10915830-sasha-alsberg", "userReview": "this book was amazing. the ending was bittersweet, i cried.

I believe Legend was the very first ARC I ever read, before I even knew what an ARC was (I won it) so it's a bit special to me. I easily found my way back into this story even after so long; a feat in of itself considering my lack of memory (it's scary how much I forget by the time a sequel releases). Prodigy lives up to its predecessor, maybe even surpassing it with the incredible progress in the world development--which was something I was a tad disappointed by in Legend. We finally discover the reason for the current state of this world; we get to understand a lot more of what it now comprises of, both tangibly and politically. In consequence, the plot itself is a little slower paced than Legend, however I doubt this will lead to many complaints seeing as how much more we learn about the complexities of their affairs. I remember thinking, while reading Legend, that this series was a perfect example of dual POV done right. I still agree with this fact; Day and June are two very different characters, reflected both by their voices and personalities. Switching from one character to the next is painless and never disorienting, nor did I ever lose track of which POV I was currently reading (many dual POVs tend to blend into one another). In this sequel, we observe a lot of character growth in which both Day and June are fighting against deeply rooted indoctrinated beliefs, not knowing who they should trust in this messed up world anymore. This inner turmoil is shown throughout the book, making it it's easy to see and sympathize with their personal struggles. Day and June being separated for a large part of book means there is not a great deal of romance, though in my opinion this was greatly needed for them to be free to find themselves; to figure out where they belong in this broken system.Assassination and conspiracy rule the plot of this sequel. Despite my mention that it's not especially fast paced, there is plenty of commotion that advances the story. Besides character and world building, the plot takes on intriguing twists and turns, some predictable, but others that took me completely by surprise. Seeing more of the world means we finally visit the Colonies that we're all dying to see. It's only a glimpse, however. Just enough to make us crave for more, yearning to see every inch of this mysterious and talked up place. At least I'm sure we'll get to see more of it in the third book, so it wasn't too big a disappointment.A sequel worthy of its name, Prodigy not only continues the story of our beloved Day an June, it strengthens and molds it, proving itself to be an essential part of this series. --An advance copy was provided by the publisher for review.For more of my reviews, visit my blog at Xpresso Reads"}, {"userName": "Liam", "userReviewDate": "Nov 17, 2014", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/34270521-liam", "userReview": "I AM AN EMOTIONAL WRECK RIGHT NOW I DON'T EVEN KNOW WHAT TO SAY basically, this book did NOT disappoint but it did destroy meI'll admit it did take me longer to get into than Legend but when I got hooked I literally couldn't put this book downJune and Day will be the death of me that is all I have to say about themI loved the turn the story has taken in this book, the plot has thickened massively and I love it!!

Like normal people do. If I just walked by you on some street one sunny morning and thought you were cute, stopped, shook your hand, and said, \"Hi, I'm Daniel.\u201d ^^^Yes I've read this series twice now and if you have read the third book, you can take a guess at why I'm drenched in my own tears.. The first book was good- cute, nothing amazingly spectacular but enough to make me really take an interest in the characters. This book took the feels to a new level, at least for me.June and Day are on the run, trying to survive and have hopes of finding the patriots and bartering with them to save Eden. Though the story starts off right where it ends in book one, the plot changes drastically with lots of nice little twists and turns. I was on my toes throughout the entire book. This was such an easy read- easy for me to fly through it. Even now, after reading it a second time- I was still racing through yet trying to savor every precious moment June and Day have together. Trust me, though they admit to feelings in the first book- they are far from ever being together. There's none of the 'oh look the main characters are together so its no longer interesting.' Don't be fooled.  Your heart will suffer.Day is nothing short of a perfect and precious human being. He's bound at heart by so many factors- guilt over his family, Tess, and this strange connection with June. I love being in his perspective- seeing how he sees the world. Idk.. I just have such a connection to his character. I still love June and yes, even Anden and Tess. But really, Day just steals the show. Not sorry. The world grows a bit in this book but isn't anything super detailed- but I'm kinda glad it isn't overly developed. It is described simply enough that it makes sense and not lacking- but the focus really is meant to be on the characters. Don't expect to be wow'ed by the dystopia factors.**Okay, I've said this once before, but Marie Lu definitely listed these characters as too young. Just make them older in your head... seriously. It helps.I'd say if you connected to the characters at all in book one- it is definitely worth continuing the series. My heart is forever locked in.

Luckily websites like Recaptains have detailed summaries of such books, so I didn't have to reread the whole book again.I know that I really liked the first book in this series, but I think I might just be over this dystopian YA trope. Don't get me wrong: I love YA and I love dystopian fiction but I think I might have liked this book more if I had read it a few years earlier. By now I've read The Hunger Games, I've read Divergent. And they were both more thrilling than Prodigy, more original. And the writing was better, as well.What I'm also over are love triangles (*vomits*), jealousy drama and stupid fights over nothing that only exist so the relationship between boy and girl doesn't get boring. And there was lots of that in here I'm afraid.Moreover, the plot was too predictable. As I said, I've read enough books set in the former United States that feature fractions, rebels, revolutions and starcrossed lovers. Prodigy couldn't add anything new to the plot. It wasn't a bad book though, so I'll read Champion anyway. Just not anytime soon.

Prodigy reminded me too much of The Hunger Games, and not in a good way. Also, I hated Day and the dumb love square. -What's what: After June and Day escaped from the evul-but-not-actually-all-that-evul-Republic, they joined the not-so-evul-but-secretly-evul-Patriots. Also, June was given the task to assassinate the new Elector of the Republic. And Day reunited with his childhood friend, Tess\u2026 And then moaned about his life. Good times.-June was a decent enough heroine. At times her voice came across as cold and distant. I would have liked a little more emotion from her narration. All she seemed to care about was Day, and it was just pathetic. She really needed other things to feel passionate about. On the plus side, I liked how capable, clever and skilled she was.-Day was awful. He was so self pitying and righteous. Ugh, and that huge chip on his shoulder was off putting. It was annoying how he acted like June looked down at people when it was actually him that was stuck up and judgmental. He kept judging everyone who had money and who lived in comfort \u2014 his bitterness and resentment was annoying to read about.-Also, I was irritated with Day's blind support for the colonies. It was ridiculous \u2014 how did he know they weren't as bad as the Republic? What facts did he know about them? Why didn't he research them?Oh and how was it that Day was made out to be such a player at age 15?! I just can't accept a 15 year old as a player.-Day and Tess. Ugh, why couldn't they have just stayed friends? Why did they have to have romantic feelings for each other? They worked much better as pseudo brother and sister. It was bizarre that Day seemed to care more for Tess than June, even though he was meant to be in love with June. It ended up looking like Day was just in lust/obsessed with June rather than in love with her, and I don't think that was how the June/Day romance was meant to be perceived.-The romance was just a mess\u2026 Day claimed to love June yet he wanted and worried about Tess more. Surely, the girl he loved would matter more than a good friend, regardless of how long he'd known each girl??-I was pissed that Day said that he would save Tess instead of June if he had to choose between them. So yea, he'd let the girl he's supposedly in love with die so he could save his friend. Really? How can he be in love with June when he would rather save another girl over her? Was that meant to be romantic? Even though he'd known Tess for years and June for a few months, it was still idiotic because he was supposed to be in love with June not Tess. -It also irritated me that Day was number one for June, whilst June was at the bottom of the list for Day. Day even admitted to himself that he hated June because she ruined his friendship with Tess. WTF?! June loves Day wholly\u2026 yet Day hates June because she got between him and his other love interest?! WTF?! Ugh.-It's obvious June will be Day's HEA - and I'd prefer it if he didn't want June dead more than his other love interest, it just makes the HEA unrealistic. I'd rather June ended up with someone else. Day doesn't love her as much as he claims. Actually, I'm not sure he loves her at all.-Day being told at the end that he was dying. Really? WTF?! What was the point of that? It's obvious he's going to survive. Why write such a cheap cliffhanger?!-I liked Tess in the first book but in this one she was pathetic. She kept throwing herself at Day when he was clearly infatuated with June. I knew Tess was going to turn into the jealous, bitter love interest that was bitchy to the heroine. I would have liked the author to take Tess's character down a more original route, and had her caring for Day as a brother or a friend. Apparently, all secondary female character have to be petty jealous cows.-Did June have one female person in her life that she cared about? No. It was all about Metias and Day. Ugh.Overall, I wasn't impressed. I liked Legend but this was such a disappointment - Day became insufferable, the plot was dull and the romance was horrible.

Just too much of a romance novel for me to stomach finishing it.I really understand the importance of character development.

I finally found myself looking for other things to do rather than picking up the book to read. That's a bad sign so I decided it was time to put this one down and move on to something else.Such a disappointment because the action of the first book of the series was sorely missing from this one.
