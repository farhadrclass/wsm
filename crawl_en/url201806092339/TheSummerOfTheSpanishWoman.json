Reminiscent of Gone with the Wind, it also has a fiesty female protagonist with Irish roots. Because i've just relocated for the first time, I identified with her move to another country, IWhile the story is engaging, it doesn't measure up to Mitchell's saga or meet the literary standards of the likes of A.S. Byatt. That did not influence my enjoyment one whit and I wasn't disappointed when the predictable narrative ended on a happy note. Who wants to escape to a somber reality?"}, {"userName": "Cphe", "userReviewDate": "Sep 17, 2015", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/14907696-cphe", "userReview": "Not my favourite novel by this author whose work I normally enjoy. I found it slow going in places and the ending was quite abrupt I thought. The historical aspect was interesting and quite detailed, the Spanish culture and wine making. The characters themselves weren't as rounded or appealing which is a trade mark of this author's work and the romance itself felt underdeveloped. It is well written but didn't hold my attention as with other books by the author."}, {"userName": "Kate", "userReviewDate": "Jun 15, 2017", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/25774230-kate", "userReview": "I didn't think beginning this book I'd have given it four stars but it continually grew on me as I continued to read. I haven't read a family saga for a while and this one was a bit different, (perhaps it was the setting) but with the same bones of them all, strong woman, unfortunate circumstances. I loved the heroine."}, {"userName": "Pamela Darling", "userReviewDate": "Sep 28, 2017", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/28091065-pamela-darling", "userReview": "Magnificent!!!I was mesmerized. by this story.

It combines the romance and mystery of Ireland with the exotic warmth of Spain and its wine-growing culture and traditions. The main character Charlie (Charlotte) is a strong female character who loves, suffers and grows, immersing herself in the vineyards and bodegas of Jerez, after she and her mother are forced to leave their beloved Clonmara estate in Ireland. The legend of the \"Spanish Woman\" who spent a summer with her grandfather, Lord Blodmore, decades before comes into play and weaves a tale of deceit, betrayal and revenge though the story; events from the past that keep reaching into the future. Charlie is thrown up against some daunting adversaries, the powerful Don Paulo and the rich and autocratic Marquesa de Pontevedra, both bent on destroying the Blodmores. She also has to care for her loveable but flawed, alcoholic mother, and many other people who are added to her household. I found the romance between teenage Charlotte and thirty year old, newly married Richard, the new heir to the estate, after a five minute horse-ride along the beach contrived and almost ludicrous, but the rest of the story had me gripped and showed me a Spain I knew little about."}, {"userName": "Catie", "userReviewDate": "Sep 15, 2012", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/5541450-catie", "userReview": "On the one hand, the window into the world of the Sherry families in Spain in the early twentieth century was fascinating and gripping in it's own right.On the other, the people side of the story felt oddly skew-whiff throughout. I never felt a great deal of empathy for the heroine; the older people were more interesting. The juxtaposition of the very realistic depiction of the sherry trade and the heightened Gothic story-line was uneasy.I also disliked the ending which seemed abrupt (especially considering the pages I had slogged through to get there)and unresolved.I generally enjoy Catherine Gaskin, but for me this was not one of her best."}, {"userName": "Andrea", "userReviewDate": "Jun 08, 2016", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/1739469-andrea", "userReview": "Very good story, although epic.

Charlotte \"Charlie\" Blodmore falls in love instantly with the male heir to the Blodmore homestead in Ireland but is forced to move to Spain when she finds out he is married. She marries twice in Spain, has 5 children and suffers a lot of hearbreak while becoming an influential woman.

Can get a little tedious in wine-making details and the web of relations got confusing. But the story gets more and more compelling. There are surprises and no trite endings. It also showcases a very interesting time in global politics.
