Now that I've read it, I think it's even better than I imagined. And it's not because my imagination fell short, it's the author's talent that went long.Erik's voice is so unique, I can almost hear him speak. His mindset and behavior are exactly what I had in mind. What better way to prevent disappointment than to not hope at all? Tomas, on the other hand, is the perfect man to show Erik the error of his low self-esteem. He can show me anything, any time he wants (*wink, wink*.) Loved the hints around his origins...The secondary characters were developed just enough to let me know who they were, how they helped the story, but deeply enough that I remember them by name and even care for some. Like Alex, I'd love to know how it went for him and his German skinhead.The sex, ahhh, the sex! When it was bad, it was really bad: fast, furious, meaningless. When it was good, it was everything sex should be: raunchy, hot, sweaty and shivery, mind-blowingly delicious, heart-meltingly tender.Thank you, Oco, for fulfilling and exceeding all my expectations. I'll always treasure your gift. ^_^For those of you who haven't experienced Oco's writing and would like to read a full length story by her, go get The Violet and the Tom.

I fell in love with Erik right from the very first paragraph. And not just because he's a 1st person narrator with a quirky, sarcastic, fascinating and original voice, but because he's someone I could see myself being friends with.Erik tries so hard to convince the reader (and himself) that he's content to be the flirty, college drop-out, beach bum bartender. But little comments he lets slip along the way reveal that he really wants so much more than that, but doesn't believe he deserves it. Seriously, I identified with him more than with any narrator I've come across for a while. Watching him start to fall for Tomas, and start to open his heart to hope little by little was incredible.I think my favorite thing about this was that Erik had to make the decision that he really is worth loving all on his own. Sure, Tomas was the catalyst, but he was basically out of the picture when Erik finally stopped trying to make excuses and hide. And I loved that!Beautiful story! 4.5 rounded up for being awesomely offered for free!"}, {"userName": "Bettye Kanady", "userReviewDate": "Nov 11, 2012", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/14234482-bettye-kanady", "userReview": "I don't know how I felt about this book. I can tell you that parts of it made me angry. I can tell you that I didn't smile once during the story. I can tell you the ending didn't even make me stand up and do a dance. I'm just left feeling kind of, meh. I can't say that the swearing in it was bad, because, let's face it, I, myself, have a Ph.D in Swearology and what I read is certainly not \"swear-free\". So that's not it. I can't say that the guy's lack of confidence was a turn off, I've read worse books than this one with that subject matter. I am positive the ending didn't make me mad; it was a happy ending, for crying out loud. So I'm not really sure what it was about this book that has me so neutral and noncommittal. I don't know. I can't give this the ole thumbs up but I can't give a reason for it, and I don't like that; but there it is."}, {"userName": "Yvonne", "userReviewDate": "Jun 06, 2012", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/4812701-yvonne", "userReview": "Had a nice & easy tone that I kind of liked but Erik was way too slutty & the exhibitionist bar scene performance in front of Tomas, among others, just made him seem spiteful & petty. Tomas was so mysterious but came across sometimes as a little creepy. That whole scene where he's smelling Erik had a slight serial killer vibe.

How a guy Erik's age with a lot of bravado could act like he didn't care, didn't think he was worth a long term commitment and could feel that being carefree was all he wanted when it was anything but. Loved how Tomas saw below the bravado and saw that deep, deep down Erik wanted to be someone's only but expected disappointment so never told anyone and convinced himself he couldn't be long term so wouldn't go for it. Tomas' patience was exactly what Erik needed to wait out Erik trying to drive him away. The story was very raw and probably not for everyone because Erik makes some painful choices to read about. I enjoyed the POV - felt very realistic. Felt like a pretty typical guy in his early 20s trying to figure himself out. Nice story to add to the mix for the event."}, {"userName": "Sandra", "userReviewDate": "Jun 08, 2012", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/4100377-sandra", "userReview": "Offered for FREE from the M/M Romance Group, Love Is Always Write: Volume Three."}, {"userName": "Kelly H.

Came over on vacation with my lover, to celebrate our first year together, and ended up staying. Alone. See, the day after our arrival at the all-inclusive resort, I had to stay in our hotel room because I got the \"curse of Moctezuma\". By the time I felt better a couple of days later, he had found someone else with whom to enjoy his time off. Found them making out on the beach, sans bathing suits.So I make a living, enjoy myself, it's all sex, no feelings. Won't let myself fall into that crap again.Right now? There's a very cute someone crouching below the bar, having a body shot off of what I'm pouring, drinking it off of a very interested part of my body. He's a new co-worker and I like him, a lot, but I won't let it get beyond that.Dear author, can you give this gorgeous guy back his belief in love and an HEA?PHOTO DESCRIPTION: Good looking young guy in a baseball cap drizzling a drink down his chest.
