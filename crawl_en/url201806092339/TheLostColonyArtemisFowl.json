I have guessed by now how you will start the book. Of course, after reading the last four books of the series. So I was bored in the beginning except for one thing. There was action and little excitement. Or I also consider the excitement in this was slightly unnecessary. Maybe it's just me?? Don't know but I was feeling just like that. The most important thing of my dislikes is the Villain. I couldn't connect with her. I liked Opal Koboi more.Nevertheless, I enjoyed after the beginning.

Better written and with more intelligent contemplation of elements like magic and technology, this is a series that readers of all ages can enjoy. By book five, we\u2019ve been introduced to a wide and fun cast of characters, and unfortunately had one of our good friends die. There is no over-arcing plot between books, though there are certainly continuing themes and characters, so a reader can pick up the series at any point. I\u2019m a big fan of starting at the beginning, but this is a series that could actually be read from any book.While I think this book is much more complex and thought-out than many books I\u2019ve read, I did feel that in comparison with the rest of the series, this book just wasn\u2019t as good. I was excited when I got it, drove an hour away to the nearest bookstore to find it, started reading right away, and then I ended up putting it down later that day in favor of watching Veronica Mars . It just didn\u2019t keep my attention like the other books had, and the spot where I drifted away for about two weeks was the same spot that my editor drifted away at too.Still, if you like the other books, you\u2019ll want to read this one and not give it up. The second half of the book is far more interesting and the ending made me jump up and down with joy for what is being set-up for the next book. It\u2019s kind of nice to have an Artemis Fowl book that I\u2019m sure will have a sequel, since the last few books have ended on more questionable notes. Maybe that was part of the problem with this book, because the last book ended on a note that didn\u2019t *need* a sequel, so this book didn\u2019t have as much of a place to start off from.Read the rest of my review at  Bookwyrm Chrysalis"}, {"userName": "Adibah Atiqa (elentiyareads)", "userReviewDate": "Nov 30, 2017", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/67283364-adibah-atiqa-elentiyareads", "userReview": "my Artemis Fowl's reading playlist : https://open.spotify.com/user/debbyhattan/playlist/1rQmLp9EHxnQwB72zHGgSk\n\u201cControl puberty?\" snorted the bodyguard.\"If you manage that, you'll be the first.\u201d\nThis book literally got me cracked up when it comes to the humor of Artemis' stage of growing up xD How smol and so innocent he is back then from the very first book till now the sixth.

However, he is one of the laziest writers I've read in a while. His work would be so much better if he spend a little time on it; he has the manner of a 10 year old boy with a brilliant idea, desperate to gush it all out before it's lost.There is no excuse for a children's book to be shoddy.

We have a saying in Greek about this kind of thing, \"to pull it by the hair\", when a creator decides to keep a series/ a TV show/ etc. going, even though they don't really have the inspiration or will to do so anymore (in this case: \"Eoin Colfer is pulling the Artemis Fowl series by the hair!\"), so they just introduce increasingly ridiculous plot points. For a prime example of this, see JK Rowling's \"The Cursed Child\", which is a JOKE. Enough said.So like I said, this series has begun to be pulled by the hair with the introduction of YET ANOTHER problem that might expose the Fae world to the humans. So many in the approximately 2 years that Artemis has known them. If fae-exposing issues arise so often, how did they deal with them before Artemis, to whom they run asking for help every time? The problem in this book wasn't even caused by him at all, unlike the previous ones.Also: Holly quit the LEP at the end of the previous book, but is recruited at a very similar service at the beginnng of this book, so basically nothing changed even though her quiting the LEP was a big deal in the previous book.Hey, all the AF books were written in a very simplitic, dare I say lazy writing style, but this one is the one where the plot got a bit lazy too.

For some reason I always start reading these books with a bit of reluctance because they are, after all, kids books. A few pages into the book though I am always hooked again; this continues to be the case.In this book Artemis calculates that the time warped island that demons live on is slowly unraveling. He is attempting to prove his calculation by detaining a time warped demon. With a demon as proof he is hoping that fairykind will take him seriously and take action to save the demon race. When he shows up at the next demon appearance he finds that he is not he only one who has made calculations about demon appearances. A girl Artemis's age, name Minerva, kidnaps the displaced demon in hopes of completing research on the demon and hopefully winning the Noble Prize. Of course everyone's plans end up collapsing and chaos ensues.The book is action packed and non-stop intellectual fun from the beginning to the end. The new characters introduced are wonderful. Minerva is the perfect female counterpart to Artemis and No.1, who revels in his new found English vocabulary, is a hoot. The whole gang is back and ready to deliver. Holly is in for a lot of action and Foaly has a whole new bag of tricks in his hands..er...I mean hoofs. Artemis is taking his turn as a \"good guy\" seriously and his new outlook on life really endears him to the reader. The addition of Minerva as a possible love interest is very interesting. Finally Artemis has someone to laugh at quark jokes with.This is another fun book that further enhances the Artemis Fowl series.

Things also moved so quickly that sometimes it was hard to keep up, but it definitely kept me on the edge.I was slightly disappointed with Minerva. It appeared that Colfer wanted to create an equal for Artemis (just in time for him to develop a romantic interest since he's going through puberty). And while Minerva is definitely a twelve-year genius in her own right, she is far from Artemis' equal. Especially considering that Colfer goes out of the way to highlight the fact that she's as girly as possible by highlighting just how pretty she is, throwing tantrums when she doesn't get what she wants, and getting emotional when things go wrong. Girl geniuses are usually the opposite... actually. Artemis was very detached when it came to his plans, even when his plans went wrong, and he always had several contingency plans as back-up. Frankly, I'm just tired of having one token female in a cast of all men.The end action sequence was definitely epic. So much was happening so quickly and the chaos was palpable.
