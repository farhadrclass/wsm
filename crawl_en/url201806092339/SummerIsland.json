She's a famous syndicated radio talk show host, dispensing advice about family and relationship. What the public didn't know was how far away her life was from what she preached. When that was inevitably leaked, Nora returns to Summer Island where she has to come to terms with the world she walked away from a decade before. I liked the story, even though it was fairly predictable. It tackled some strong themes, particularly the mother-daughter dynamics and the imprint those relationships leave from one generation to the next. Another was the carnage created by divorce, specifically when the children are left in the dark about why the relationship failed and that silence allows them to choose sides. I also liked the contrast between the Bridge family and the wealthy Sloans who vacationed on the island each summer and formed a connection. The two sons, though their parents' marriage was still intact, suffered because of it and neglect. In summary, it was an interesting story with thought provoking themes, even though I could have scripted the ending myself. The narrator gave a good but unremarkable performance as I couldn't hear much in the way of character distinctions. I've heard many positives about the author and am interested in exploring more of her work. 3.5 stars"}, {"userName": "Britany", "userReviewDate": "Oct 22, 2017", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/5550397-britany", "userReview": "Nora Bridge is a \"Delihah\"- ish radio personality with her own advice column in the local newspaper. Nora brilliantly responds to her fans with candid advice and helps them all through their difficult questions. Nora's life is anything but perfect- she has no relationship with her two estranged daughters (both of which are falling apart in their own ways). Ruby Bridge is a stand up comedian dreaming of her own sitcom when she's offered a chance to write a tell all book about her mother (who she hates). She eagerly cashes in the check and begins to write...Nora falls prey to a blackmailer who exposes her to her loyal readers and becomes a huge scandal- can she get through this?The stage is set for another great book by Kristin Hannah and I couldn't turn the pages fast enough. Great life lessons to take away from the story- family secrets that are exposed and of course- a good romance to root for. For me, while this was readable, it also didn't dip too far below the surface and I had issues with the actual scandal that was presented. In my opinion, I just don't think this would've spiraled as far as it did , maybe it's the cynical side of me coming out or maybe our society takes much more to actually create a negative viewpoint. This book was a good break from some of the other tougher books out there."}, {"userName": "Ashley Daviau", "userReviewDate": "Mar 24, 2017", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/35915119-ashley-daviau", "userReview": "I was expecting this book to be a lighthearted easy read but boy was I ever wrong! This book absolutely destroyed me and had me sobbing by the end. I related so strongly to the main character Ruby, I felt like I was reading about myself at times and I think that's why I reacted so strongly to her story. In fact, reading Ruby's story opened my eyes to my own destructive behaviour that mirrors hers and it really forced me to think about difficult issues that I normally avoid. It was startling how much her life, everything she's been through and the demons in her closet were similar to mine. I just sat there for the longest time after finishing it, trying to gather my thoughts in a way that made sense. Reading this book was such a life changing moment for me and I simply can't express how much this book affected me. I still can't stop thinking about this book and I'm so thankful it ended up in my hands, I really needed to read this at this time in my life."}, {"userName": "Myrna", "userReviewDate": "Nov 30, 2016", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/8789819-myrna", "userReview": "Hannah always creates moving books and I love that her novels are set in the Northwest. Entertaining and satisfying, Summer Island is a compelling story about mothers and daughters. This novel like her others has an element of sadness and dissension but makes you enjoy the ending and root for the characters. I agree that parts are predictable, but it didn't lessen the enjoyment. I really like this author (I've read 11 of her books) and she does family drama very well."}, {"userName": "Renee", "userReviewDate": "Apr 07, 2011", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/2918559-renee", "userReview": "Okay, I am at work, so I'll have to make this review short and to the point.This is the third Kristin Hannah book I have read, and while the first one was very touching ( True Colors ), the last two including this one, have been so-so.I begin to think these books are like Lifetime movies. I don't know why I would watch, they aren't particularly any good... and yet, it is easy to let a wasted few hours go by while a movie (book) full of cliches and emotional manipulation bumbles along. Sometimes they can be touching, and other times I can literally feel braincells slowing down and dying off.This book was no different. The main character Ruby was so predictable as to be nearly one-dimensional. Of course she can't accept love. Of course she hates her mother. Of course she dyes her hair black and wears lots of eyeliner. Of course she feels betrayed by her mother, and therefore, she will betray her back. I was so sick and tired of Ruby that I could not even feel bad for her. And, as one would expect, she miraculously makes up with her mother and falls in love with a rich, successful man that sees through all her many (I do mean many!) emotional flaws and worships her anyway.Ugh. Like bad perfume - it was too cloying for me. Tried a tad too much. And, Hannah's attempt at adding humor fell short, very short."}, {"userName": "Mandy Sue", "userReviewDate": "Aug 12, 2008", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/1410084-mandy-sue", "userReview": "Summer Island is a very touching story about the power of love through healing and forgiveness. It reminds us that each story has three sides and how sometimes we need to look past our own hurt and anger to renew an old relationship.Summer's Island is sold on it being a book about Mother/Daughter relationships but it is so much more. It is truths hidden behind masks; love lost yet still yearned for. It is pain from being apart from family; and resentment for losing so much time.Kristen Hannah once again delivers a powerful story that anyone can relate too. Summer's Island is both sad and uplifting having you laugh and cry throughout the whole story and reaching for the phone to call someone you lost contact with when it is over."}, {"userName": "Tracy", "userReviewDate": "Sep 09, 2017", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/1950889-tracy", "userReview": "This book was about the hurt that difficult decisions can make in a marriage and family and how secrets only compound the damage. This book followed Ruby, the daughter of Nora, a famous radio personality who left her family 11 years earlier. Nora leaving her family really damaged her kids and this book explores the problems that caused for Ruby in her interpersonal relations with everyone she met afterwards. Ruby and Nora were forced back together after Nora was in an accident and they ended up reconciling."}, {"userName": "Obsidian", "userReviewDate": "Sep 16, 2016", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/35942740-obsidian", "userReview": "\"Summer Island' deals with a young woman Ruby who is estranged from her famous mother (Nora) and barely talks to her older sister and father who is long remarried with a new child. Readers are slowly walked through these two women's histories and we find out what Nora did to have her estranged from Ruby and partially estranged from her other daughter as well.I liked the character of Ruby. She was feisty, but passionate. Also was totally in the wrong several times so I did feel for her. What was good though is that she didn't just stick her head in the sand when she slowly found out her mother's real history which led to her own. I do wonder though how she didn't see what was really going on? I think sometimes you see what you want, and this book takes a mirror up to those who believe that their childhoods were perfect and turns it on their head when it's revealed not so much.I felt for Nora too though I wish we had gotten more involved with her storyline. I liked how the book focuses on Ruby with Nora coming along to give clarity to more and more. I wonder though why she didn't try sooner with Ruby though? Did she not just want to deal with rejection? Was it easier? Considering that Nora's job was an Agony Aunt of sorts it seems surreal she was advising other people on their lives when her life was really not this idealized thing. When Nora's past comes a calling, I think Hannah did a great job showing the repercussions of what would happen. One reason why I gave this only four stars though, is that we don't spend much time with Ruby's sister (Caro) who was dealing with some very real things. I didn't like how her storyline ended up, since it felt tacked on (give everyone a happy ending). It would have worked for me if there was a sequel dealing with Caro and what was going on in her marriage and how she felt overwhelmed as a mother.The other person this book focuses on is Ruby's old boyfriend Dean and his brother who is dying of cancer. I really wish that Dean had been cut out of the book. He added nothing to the story and I find it hard to believe based on what we see of him initially, that he was sitting around pining for his teenage girlfriend. He and Ruby really didn't have any chemistry, and I was more focused on the storyline focusing on Ruby and her mother, and then Ruby and her sister then with him.The writing was really great and the book flowed wonderfully. We get to see the roller coaster of Ruby and Nora's relationship and how flawed things were and why neither one of them really wanted to revisit the past.The setting of Summer Island in the San Juans didn't really get used that well. We had people go sailing and go to the beach once in while, but nothing else really. I would have liked the beach aspect or the small island life with people that both characters would have known get used a lot more."}, {"userName": "Cathleen", "userReviewDate": "Jun 22, 2012", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/4525337-cathleen", "userReview": "I didn't have this book on my TBR list. I picked this up last weekend along with another book from this author. I started reading this Wednesday night. Massachusetts is having a heat wave and I do not have air conditioning. I thought this would be a good book to read during the hot, sticky and sleepless nights.I finished reading this story at 4:45 AM this morning. Some books should come with warning labels so you will know the story between the covers may cause you to feel a variety of emotions. There were times I found my laughter or smile quickly changing to tears. This story is about a woman who walked away from her marriage and her 2 daughters. She becomes a radio celebrity with her own show. She gives advice to callers on a variety of issues. Then something from her past is made public and she becomes undesirable. She gets suspended from her talk show and her fans quickly turn their backs on her. She becomes the latest \"news\". She finds herself in the house she lived in with her husband and children. Her youngest daughter, who she had no contact with for many years, is staying with her. From that point on unfolds a story of a mother and a daughter trying to find a way to come to terms with each other and a past that caused so much pain. This is a remarkable story in so many ways. A family coming to terms with a painful past, secrets, forgiveness, rebuilding of relationship between a mother and her daughters, loss of a close family friend and the renewal of a childhood romance.I recommend this book to anyone who enjoys this genre."}, {"userName": "Xana", "userReviewDate": "Jun 10, 2016", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/5314072-xana", "userReview": "A pontua\u00e7\u00e3o justa seria 4,5*.Comecei esta leitura com muita expectativa. \u00c0s vezes funciona ao contr\u00e1rio mas, desta vez, n\u00e3o me desiludiu.

I picked it up in a whim for $2, and it sat on my shelf for a good 4 months. What a wasted time! This book was wonderful. Complex and intellectually stimulating. I felt for Nora and was drawn to her despite her flaws. Ruby and Caro were definitely on opposite ends of the spectrum, but it worked so well. As a daughter and a sister, I could easily relate to pieces of them. You look at their family, their story, and see the good and the bad of your own. You remember, if only for the moments you are reading, how precious family is and how quickly time passes, and you drift apart. It doesn't matter the intentions or the reasons, this book makes you want to call your loved ones just to take advantage of the moments you do have. Family is about fighting, forgiving, accepting, and loving; not only one another but yourself. I loved that Nora, despite her flaws, could see through the bad and help those in the wrong direction. I didn't feel she was a hypocrite, just lost on her journey to find herself, and make peace with her past.My favorite character was Eric. I loved his honesty and outlook on life. His character was deeply developed even though we didnt/couldn't interact with him the way we could the other characters. I wept for him. It's no surprise, we prepare for it all along, but you never think you will be so enveloped in a character until the final moments hit you. I hated his parents and their selfishness, but realize the gift that his suffering gave to Nora and Ruby. I would 100% recommend this novel to friends. This is definitely a keeper! I look forward to reading more by the author, and can't believe it's taken me so long to discover her."}, {"userName": "Carla Geraldes", "userReviewDate": "Oct 16, 2016", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/21693847-carla-geraldes", "userReview": "4.5.Mais um livro intenso, arrebatador e emocionante.

Yet one day she turned her back on them all and vanished into thin air. A decade later her youngest daughter Ruby finds herself grappling with the heartbreaking legacy of her mother\u2019s selfishness. Stuck in the spin cycle of financial and emotional debt, Ruby is listless, angry and desperate to make a buck. After Nora, ironically a nationally beloved radio advice show host of \u201cFamily First,\u201d becomes the center of a scandal, Ruby decides to make a quick buck by writing a tell-all roast about her absentee mother for a sleazy tabloid. Just when life couldn\u2019t get worse for poor Nora, she wreaks her car in an alcohol-induced haze, rendering herself incapacitated in a wheelchair. Alone and helpless, she\u2019s left to rely on the one person who despises her the most: Ruby.Guilted into taking care of her down-trodden mother at her childhood home in Summer Island, Ruby decides to maximize her quality time with mother dearest by writing her tell-all. But when her anger ebbs and forviness fights its way to the surface, she sruggles with the moral dilemma of cashing in on her mother\u2019s scandal or killing the story and letting her mother back in her heart. Lessons of redemption and second chances are also infused in the two subplots: one a romance between Ruby and Dean, an old boyfriend who she ditched after her mother left, and another involving Dean\u2019s dying brother with only days left to make peace with his broken family. Conveniently they\u2019re all summering on the island and rebuilding their relationships. Brimming with sentiments of forgiveness and unconditional love, the book reads like a lengthy episode of a Lifetime movie under the influence of \u201cDelilah after Dark.\u201d Get out those boxes of Kleenex ladies, this one is a surefired tearjerker."}, {"userName": "Jenni", "userReviewDate": "Jan 17, 2011", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/772014-jenni", "userReview": "This is the 10th Kristin Hannah I have read this year. I think I have mentioned a few times before that she and Jodi Picoult are probably my two favorite authors. They both have a style of writing that I am drawn to, and I have never been disappointed in any of their books.\"Summer Island\" was certainly no different. Summer Island is about advice expert Nora Bridges, the two daughters she abandoned years ago (Ruby & Caroline), and some other wonderful characters (Eric the homesexual cancer patient and his brother, Dean).I was completely sucked in from Page 1. The author has a way of making my feel very strongly about each of the characters. Nora becomes involved in a tabloid scandal, and she winds up being injured in a car accident -- her fault, because she was so depressed she drove in a drunk stupor right into a tree. When the tabloid scandal gets seriously revved up, Nora decides to hide away for a while at her old lake house. Her estranged daughter Ruby gets talked into caring for her injured mother for a week. I was surprised that this book make me so emotional, as I shed a lot of tears while reading -- especially in the last half.

I really did. I adore all of Kristen Hannah\u2019s other novels (at least, the ones that I\u2019ve read), so I picked Summer Island up expecting to be sucked into a story that would make me laugh, cry, and re-examine my life. It didn\u2019t. I was left with a feeling of vague disappointment and betrayal. Perhaps I\u2019m being too harsh. After all, every genius has to have at least one moment of non-genius. It\u2019s not as if this book was a failure that I regretted reading. I liked it and enjoyed the plotline; it simply didn\u2019t live up to her other honest, real, raw, vulnerable, etc, etc works. I had also read a book (Spin, Catherine McKenzie) in the summer where the protagonist went through an internal conflict that was almost exactly like this one, so I just happened to be able to predict the ending of what is probably, for most people anyways, an unpredictable ending. Kristen Hannah has the amazing ability to write characters that are both convincing and three-dimensional, as well as captivating. Many authors try so hard to make their characters interesting that they focus too much on what they do, instead of the necessary backstory. In one of her other books, Night Road, it\u2019s taken for granted that Lexi and Zach love each other. Similarly, it\u2019s taken for granted here that Ruby and Dean love each other. Both couples have an achingly intense relationship, but Kristen Hannah skimmed over the build-up. I was left with an extremely vague sense of how they met, why they love each other, what the dynamics are between them. She focuses so much on the future that she forgets the past, which makes the present rather unsatisfying.
