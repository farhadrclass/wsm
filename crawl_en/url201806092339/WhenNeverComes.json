Davis\u2019s When Never Comes is a beautiful story of resilience, finding yourself, and learning to be open to happiness. It\u2019s a story about a woman who ran away or hid her entire life, until she was forced out of hiding. This book is an incredible addition to Women\u2019s Fiction in 2018. I think many readers will find this story to be a starting point to reflect on their own lives and identify the ghosts we all have following us around.\nChristine lives an enviable life\u2026\nMarried to handsome, charismatic, best-selling author Stephen Ludlow, book-editor Christine has the perfect marriage. They live in the very house one of Stephen\u2019s books was filmed in for the movie-adaptation. They have no children (by choice), and Christine has plenty of the independence and solitude she craves. \nChristine has worked hard to shed Christy-Lynn\u2026\nDespite the outward perfection of Christine\u2019s life, she has a dark past she\u2019d prefer to hide from the world\u2014even from her own husband. Christine grew up as Christy-Lynn Parker\u2014the child of an addict who spent her life taking care of the very mother who should be caring for her. Christy-Lynn was never able to make friends because of a string of evictions, a parade of strange men through her home, and finally a foster home that she was forced to run away from. Now, Christy-Lynn has found peace, but not happiness, in her life with Stephen. While he is off basking in his fame, Christine is left with the independence and solitude she found comfort in as a child.\nAnd then Christine finds herself in the spotlight\u2026\nChristine awakens to a knock on the door from the police, and some shocking news. Stephen was in a car accident and she is being asked to come identify his body. But there\u2019s more\u2014Christine is also asked to identify a second body. The body of a young blond woman who was in the car with her husband. As Christine\u2019s world unravels, and the press are hounding her for answers, Christine does the only thing she knows\u2014she runs. But this time, the running leads her to a place where she may finally be able to create her own life, the one thing she has never had.ReflectionThis is truly a story of resilience. Christine has spent so much of her life trying to just survive, that she has never really lived. With a childhood marked by pain and struggle that no child should know, Christine has developed a fear of loving anyone. And in turn, Christine has never really experienced the security and safety of someone else loving her. When Christine runs and ends up in the charming town of Sweetwater, she finds an opportunity to not only escape the shock of her husband\u2019s secrets, but to create a new life separate from who she was. With her new life Christine is able to do things she was never able to in the past\u2014make friends and choose a new career. And most importantly, Christine is able to learn that happiness is something she can choose. When she stops letting others dictate her life, Christine opens up a world of opportunities for herself that she never dared dream of.Thank you to Lake Union Publishing, to Barbara Davis, and to NetGalley for an opportunity to read this book in exchange for an honest review."}, {"userName": "Elizabeth of Silver's Reviews", "userReviewDate": "Feb 24, 2018", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/1882027-elizabeth-of-silver-s-reviews", "userReview": "From rags to riches. From running away as a child to running away as an adult.Christy-Lynn had her share of bad times as she was growing up and thought when Stephen Ludlow, famed author, married her she was done with struggling and bad times.But...Stephen Ludlow wasn't exactly who he appeared to be. When he was found in an icy river after a crash, details were not something Christy-Lynn wanted to know. Stephen wasn't the only person in his car when they pulled him out of the river, and the other person wasn't his wife.Christy-Lynn couldn't handle the press and snuck away in the middle of the night just like she did when she ran away as a child.Christy-Lynn was better off as an adult running away and found the perfect place to settle.

I was captivated by Christy-Lynn's story, a young woman so deep in the throes of despair, so torn with guilt and regret, that she won't let herself love anyone, or let anyone love her...she doesn't feel deserving of love. Her life is full of nevers, the doors she keeps closed to protect her heart. The emotions in this book leap off the page...I found myself holding my breath waiting to find out what decisions Christy-Lynn would make as she slowly, carefully, fearfully cracks open those doors just a little bit. I found myself getting angry with her at times, because I was so emotionally invested in her life, and the lives of those around her! This is such a heartfelt, poignant story, which reveals the best and the worst about people, but mostly shows us that we all have the capacity to love and forgive and to be happy."}, {"userName": "Camille Maio", "userReviewDate": "Oct 28, 2017", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/3934710-camille-maio", "userReview": "Once again, author Barbara Davis has pulled me out of everything I need to do and planted me right in the middle of her compelling characters and story. When Never Comes is the story of a woman trapping herself in her past, limited by all the ways she was hurt by others.

When said husband is famous and the vultures are just waiting for the right moment to feed on you, armed with this tantalizing information? You run. Like any seasoned runaway will do, you act on that animal instinct and run as far and fast as you can.Christy-Lynn had no idea her famous author husband was a philandering douchebag. When morgue photos are leaked of the topless blonde found in the car with said philanderer, she realizes she never knew him at all. She empties the safe and flees in the night, no longer willing to feel victimized by the incessant paparazzi.She finds herself in a small town with no intentions to stay, but soon realizes maybe this is where she can start over. When she is then struck by the news of an innocent child between her husband and his mistress, it brings her past rushing to the present.

When Never Comes is an emotionally engaging, compelling, beautiful, uplifting, and simultaneously heart breaking and heart warming story. This is the story of Christy-Lynn, awoken in the middle of the night with the news that her husband has died in an accident. At the morgue to identify his body, she's given the news that he was not alone in the car and a mystery woman has also died. Hounded by the press, she escapes town and hides away in a small town in Virginia. Christy-Lynn begins to rebuild her life and put her past behind her. Told in alternating timelines, we get flashbacks to Christy-Lynn growing up with an addict mother and eventually making her way into the foster care system. As she begins to move forward in her new life, she is haunted by her past and by this mystery woman. She begins to investigate this woman and her connection to her husband. Will she be able to move forward and forgive the people who have hurt her the most? Will she be able to build a life she loves from the ashes of her past? This was a wonderful story of redemption, forgiveness, family, and how the events of our past do not define us.

I read a few reviews and decided to continue anyway. Throughout the book I waffled on the rating. Christy-Lynn is the wife of a famous writer. He dies when his car goes off a bridge and a partially nude woman is with him. Christy-Lynn escapes the media circus and the unanswered questions in a small town miles from her home. Here she tries to begin again and reconcile her husband's death, her past with a negligent mother, foster care & as a runaway, and the knowledge that her husband the unknown woman had a child together.This book is \"slow\" - it is not fast-paced or a thriller. It is an exploration of a woman who carefully buried her past until she had to face her past and present to move on. Christy-Lynn's journey to discover herself and move on is sad and painful but heartwarming as she begins to heal and reconcile her present and her past. This book does have a HEA and the reader is left with a happy feeling that all seems to work out for the best.

Why was her husband driving around with his half-naked girlfriend in the car, when he was a successful writer and could afford a hotel room. How did he crash his car? Why did he die, but they had no scarring, they both looked beautiful upon death.2. How could the main character just up and leave her home with only two important documents with  her? No momentos, nothing. Seemed a little weird.3. If the main character lived on the street for two years after being brutally raped in foster care, how did she become a hot shot book editor and meet a hugely successful author? Nothing told about how that happened? How did she get into college? Where did she live, etc. 4. Nothing is mentioned about the fabulously successful author husband, no background except for the fact that he plagiarized something in college and he got a trailer trash groupie pregnant. Why didn't he care for his child he had with trailer trash girl? Nothing left in a will. Another thing is, he was so hugely successful, along the lines of Tom Clancy, why didn't he have a will? Other than those huge questions, it was a good read. It had a happy ending. If that was what the author was aiming for, she succeeded. In the book she has the main character as a book editor who tells her author friend to dig deeper and do more character development. That's good advice, she needs to heed her own advice."}, {"userName": "Sue ", "userReviewDate": "Feb 17, 2018", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/690922-sue", "userReview": "When Never Comes is another wonderful book by Barbara Davis.

But she also has so much money she can just buy a house and a business on a whim and still have so much left that she doesn't know what to do with it. And said new business is immediately successful, allowing her free time to go off at any time to explore her past or run away from her present. And although she has never had friends, suddenly everyone she meets now is falling all over themselves wanting to hang out with her and be her BFF even though the main thing she does is whine and complain about how sad and empty her life is. I understand that the point of the book is that she had to overcome her childhood traumas and let down her defenses.

Her marriage to the famous author Stephen Ludlow was over, he was found dead in a car accident, a semi-naked blonde next to him.

It was also about 100 pages to long. I knew exactly what was going to happen very early into the book, but it took until the very end of the story to get the full resolution. Issues with the book (spoiler alert!)1) Hard to believe the main character Christy-Lynn didn't have a SINGLE friend/acquaintance who could be with her after the news of her husband's death came out. She was just hanging out completely alone in her huge house and not one person kept her company and not a single police officer thought to come by and keep the press away. It was ridiculous that she \"couldn't\" make it to the funeral.2) Christy-Lynn leaves her house with only a small bag and never comes back for anything after her departure. Incredibly, the cop can't seem to get a hold of her...despite the fact that she has a cell phone. The cops and press *somehow* have no idea where she is, despite the fact that she is probably using credit cards, driving her own car and, you know, looks like Stephen Ludlow's wife.3) In this day and age, there is no way the press wouldn't have seized on the second victim's identity within 24 hours or discovering her existence. As an extra in Stephen's movies, there is no way she wouldn't have been found out. Plus, WHERE exactly were her clothes left? They had to have been checked in somewhere. Also hard to believe that Stephen and Honey died within city limits of where the main character lived. Her husband would have been recognized if seen with another woman. 4) I've never heard of a small business \"running smoothly\" within a few weeks of opening. Really? you open a new bookstore and then it practically runs itself so now you're bored? Also, it was awfully convenient that she could buy a bookstore and a house with no problem. I don't understand why Christy-Lynn was able to finally make friends when she clearly hadn't been able to for decades. It all came a little too easy. 5) I never understood why Stephen really fell for Christy-Lynn except that she was vulnerable. No way do I think he would have fallen for someone who lives in a dilapidated shack like Honey did. 6) Still this it's funny that Christy-Lynn \"accidentally\" ended up in Sweetwater. Also hard to believe that her new author friend hadn't heard that Stephen died MONTHS after it happened."}, {"userName": "Jenny Waterman", "userReviewDate": "Apr 28, 2018", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/35243170-jenny-waterman", "userReview": "When Never Comes by Barbara Davis is a great read with a lot of emotional ups and downs.

Part of her world is gone in an instant - but is it just the push she needs to discover and build a life of her own?

The story was well-written and beautifully told, and the characters were intriguing - I CARED what happened to them. That being said, though, I must also say that the whole thing was fairly predictable, and about halfway through, I found myself skimming to get to the next revelation. Still, I teared up at the very end, so the story obviously touched me. I would read more from this author."}], "description": "Author Barbara Davis deftly explores an emotionally charged landscape of pain, loss, and despair\u2014and the risk one woman will take in the hope of loving again.As a teenage runaway and child of an addict, Christy-Lynn learned the hard way that no address was permanent, and no promise sacred.
