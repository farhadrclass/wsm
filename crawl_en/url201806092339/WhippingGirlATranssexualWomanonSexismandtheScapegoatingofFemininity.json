She lived as a lesbian for many years and so knows stuff I can\u2019t even guess at. I told her that the strangest thing about reviewing this book (I tend to review while I read nowadays \u2013 one of the odd changes goodreads has wrought) is how each of my mock reviews started with me stressing how straight I am. It\u2019s the strangest thing. Like someone about to review a book by a Nazi might start by mentioning they have Jewish friends.Did I mention I was straight? Another friend of mine once told me he knew he was straight because he had never had a dream where he was having sex with a man, but frequently (if not incessantly) fantasised about sex with women. On the basis that you can\u2019t really control your dreams, this does seem like fairly strong proof.And because I\u2019m straight and white and middle class and English speaking and male \u2013 Jesus, it is hard to imagine I could be any more boring\u2026 I am all of the zero states. I am what normal is defined by. But this kind of privilege is the invisible kind to those who hold it, even if it is all too obvious to those who don\u2019t. Still, it puts me at a decided disadvantage \u2013 discrimination is something that happens to others and the most powerful lesson I can learn is to assume I don\u2019t understand and to try to listen with compassion.I\u2019ve also been chatting with the person that recommended I read this book. I was saying to her that my daughter can turn her tongue upside down in her mouth, literally flip it. I can\u2019t even imagine how this could be done. If I\u2019d read it in a book, rather than seen it live and in the mouth of my daughter, I might even doubt that it could be done. When I try to do it myself I can\u2019t even work out which muscles might get my tongue to do such a thing. I assume, then, that understanding genders other than our own must be much the same problem.I found a lot of this book quite challenging. To start with I am one of the people discussed here who can\u2019t understand how one could possibly know they would be happier as the other sex. It always seems to be like believing you would be happier if you spoke French before you have started learning French. If you are born male it would seem hard to imagine how you could know you would be happier female.This is actually explained in the book. The answer is that you don\u2019t know. You see, that was the other thing I\u2019ve often wondered about. If you feel quite different after taking female hormones, as I\u2019ve often heard you do \u2013 more emotional, and sex sounds better too, and even more \u2018female\u2019 \u2013 well, what did you feel before the hormones? But I\u2019d always believed the \u2018I\u2019m a woman trapped in a man\u2019s body\u2019 clich\u00e9 before, so I found this bit incredibly interesting. The bottom line is that it isn\u2019t that you feel that becoming female will certainly be right, it is that you know being male is certainly wrong.I\u2019m about to begin reading a book called How the Irish Became White. The point being that the Irish were metaphorically negroes for a long time before there were black slaves in the USA. Uneducable, fit only for crap work, morally degenerate \u2013 the Irish prove you don\u2019t need an easy to identify skin colour to mark you as inferior. When I was growing up I always assumed the Irish would find racism abhorrent. But then I met more Irish people and found that often the opposite was the case. That rather than loathing racism, they loved the idea that they weren\u2019t the bottom of the pile. The discussion in this book on how feminist and gay rights activists treat transsexuals is another example of how we always love to find someone lower in the pecking order than ourselves to affirm our self-worth.This book was also challenging because I prefer to believe that a lot of gender is socially conditioned and that genetics is very often overstated. The wonderful book Delusions of Gender shows that we grossly overstate the differences between the genders. I just find it very hard to believe there is a gene for applying lipstick or even for preferring to apply lipstick. But really, I\u2019m not sure what difference it makes. Whether people are transsexual due to their genes or as their response to our gendered society seems an exercise in hair splitting. The fact is that they are prepared to go through hell and back to become their preferred gender/sex. I just don\u2019t have the right to say they are deluded, even if I have to admit that I can\u2019t understand what it is they are going through. I have to assume they know what they are feeling more than I do.There were bits of this I didn\u2019t agree with. She makes the point repeatedly that women are sexualised in our society in ways that men simply are not. But I kept thinking of those Calvin Klein ads. Then I thought about Elvis Presley thrusting his pelvis. Then I thought of the androgynous Mick Jagger. I think it would be hard to argue that these males have not been sexualised. Or even One Direction\u2026I started off agreeing with her when she said that it really isn\u2019t anyone\u2019s business if a Transsexual has had bottom surgery. But that it is almost invariably the first thing that is asked \u2013 and that transsexuals are about the only people in the world anyone would dream of asking such a thing to. \u201cSo, tell me about your genitals.\u201d Is hardly an acceptable conversation starter with most people. Lorena said that transsexuals can hardly expect people not to be curious \u2013 if they say they are transitioning between the sexes, then this is a fairly obvious and expected question. But I thought her point was good when she said that all this does is confound physical manifestations, particularly genitals, with femininity and masculinity. If femininity is a continuum rather than a fixed opposite to masculinity, then genitals are only one aspect, rather than the final proof.There is also incredibly interesting stuff here about the gatekeepers \u2013 those who get to decide who can become female and who cannot. To get thought this it isn\u2019t enough to say you would like to have a go at being female to see how it works out. Rather, you need to prove to someone that you meet certain criteria. Often those criteria say much more about our society\u2019s view of genders than it does about your desire to become female. Some of the quotes from gatekeepers are hair curling. If you look too masculine you can be as many women trapped in a man\u2019s body as you like \u2013 you\u2019re probably not getting any treatment. And don\u2019t forget your high heals when you go to your appointment \u2013 you want to be a women, you\u2019d better act like one, and one straight out of the most sexist ad you can think of.I haven\u2019t really seen many of the films she discusses here \u2013 The Crying Game, for example, or Ace Ventura. The point is that transsexuals are often portrayed as deceivers \u2013 seeking to entrap straight guys. Like most other clich\u00e9s this one has had its day and ought to be seen for what it is \u2013 a projection of the homo-eroticism of supposedly \u2018straight\u2019 guys, rather than the deviousness of transsexuals.While we are on films I watched Marwencol recently. If I had any idea what it was about I doubt I would have watched it. Like watching films about the holocaust, I know such films are \u2018good\u2019 for me, but actually, they take me days and days to get over and I would rather not go through that. Marwencol is about a guy who is at the pub and tells some other guys he sometimes wears women\u2019s clothing. They later nearly beat him to death. The savage nature of their attack is dumbfounding. If you want proof that we, as a society, have very strange views around gender and incredibly strict policing of gender roles, this film goes a long way to providing just that.Now, before you say that this is just a few guys at the far edges of the outlining tail of society and that most people wouldn\u2019t do that \u2013 I have to say that isn\u2019t such a great argument. Yes, they are much more extreme than general society would accept \u2013 but it is hard not to see these actions as being natural consequences to the strict gendering of our society. I\u2019m saying this as someone who has never thought of putting on women\u2019s clothing or being a gender other than male \u2013 but this probably just proves how well socialised I\u2019ve been. As the author says, hand a man your handbag and watch him squirm. Try to put lipstick on him and see what happens. I think there is a pretty strong case to argue that the fear most men feel at being associated with 'women's stuff' leads to the beating the poor guy got in Marwencol.I\u2019m not sure what to make of a lot of this \u2013 basically, the argument at the end is that femininity has been grossly undervalued in our society and that many feminists likewise see the feminine as being frivolous. That it is only when both males and females begin to accept the feminine as natural, valid and universal that we will have a better society. But I can\u2019t ever see myself wearing pumps or bangles. The problem with being female seems to me to be how much time it takes. There is a nice bit of this where she says she often asks people that if she offered them ten million dollars would they agree to live the rest of their lives as the other sex? Very few people ever agree to such a trade, even in theory. It is an interesting thought experiment and interesting because we so often ask transsexuals to do exactly that \u2013 live in a body they don\u2019t feel they belong in \u2013 but without the money to compensate.Now, while I\u2019ve been telling people about this book I\u2019ve found it insanely hard to keep referring to the author as she \u2013 like my desire to constantly remind people I\u2019m straight while I write this, it is something I\u2019ve found really irritating about myself. The author claims this is an example of \u2018cissexual\u2019 prejudice. But I think it must be a deep expression of gender socialisation, as no matter how much I want to think of the author as female, in the flow of conversation I found myself constantly using the male pronoun, despite myself and despite my frustration and annoyance with myself for doing so.I was pleased I was right about the novel Middlesex too. Just saying\u2026 There is nothing worse than someone thinking they know about stuff they really can\u2019t know about \u2013 that really shouldn\u2019t be the role of an author. Writing isn\u2019t about guessing, it should be about exploring what you know \u2013 at least, that\u2019s my latest definition. For an author to say they want to write a book about a Intersexual, but not even bother to talk to one is pretty despicable. A very interesting book \u2013 thanks Laia."}, {"userName": "Sarah", "userReviewDate": "Jul 28, 2011", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/5906372-sarah", "userReview": "This book has two halves, one of which I loved and one of which was pretty terrible. The parts where she discussed, analyzed, and criticized transgender issues from terminology to medical processes were awesome. Serano is a wonderful writer who really knows what she is talking about in this section. She challenges assumptions, educates, and really makes the reader think. I especially loved her final conclusions, that the focus should be on confronting gender privilege instead of simply performing gender in alternate ways.But the part about feminism was frustrating and terrible. I would guess that 80% of her examples of feminists who disparage trans people come from the 70's and 80's and feminist and trans histories of that period - she is essentially telling the feminist movement to confront and change something that is already being confronted and changed by the third wave. She also uses the Michigan Womyn's Music Festival as an example of feminists excluding trans women, but Michigan is not a feminist event, just an event with a lot women. She also seems to think that feminism doesn't encourage femininity in boys, which is simply incorrect. You can find examples of this in the feminist movement in books like William's Doll in 1972, the second-wave slogan \"feminism is the liberation of the masculine in every woman and the feminine in every man\", and the fact that encouraging traditionally feminine traits in men has a major component of third wave feminism. That said, she does have some good suggestions that third-wavers should take to heart (such as not discussing trans-exclusion policies in the media without trans activists, not supporting trans-excluding events, listening to trans people, examining their cis privilege, etc). It is clear that Serano's understanding of feminism that is primarily colored by her negative experiences with second-wavers, which pretty much dooms the book if you are a third-waver because you will be frustrated with her lack of current information. I would recommend this book to someone interested in trans feminism, with the caveat that the person knew enough about feminism to see past the parts that gloss over feminisms diverse history."}, {"userName": "Julian", "userReviewDate": "Jul 03, 2007", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/170217-julian", "userReview": "COMPLETELY AWESOME IN EVERY WAY. Gender analysis and theory that is somehow not wanktastic and jargony, is fresh, clear, and not all bogged down in a bunch of agenda driven bullshit, and based on the author's experiences as a trans woman.

Brilliant."}, {"userName": "TJ", "userReviewDate": "Nov 22, 2012", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/14809227-tj", "userReview": "There are things I love about this book, mostly Serano's more personal writing, and some of the writing about her experiences on estrogen are beautiful/heartbreaking. All of her writing on hormones feels very spot-on to me, as do her theories on \"the scapegoating of femininity.\"But there were too many little unfair jabs at non-binary/genderqueer folks, and some of them felt really hurtful and maybe she made me cry. It's pretty clear that Serano doesn't think that identifying outside of the binary is the most legitimate thing, but she doesn't wanna come right out and say it. She hints at thinking that genderqueerness is a mostly politicized identity not rooted in a similar sort of gender/body sadness or discomfort/disconnect as hers. She doesn't try very hard to make room in her big gender theories for non-binary folks, either, or even to use language inclusive of non-binary genders. And how are you gonna write this sort of book and mention race like, twice??STILL a lot of this writing is useful/important if you go into braced for an uncritically white, middle-class, sorta maybe probably binarist perspective ETA: I wrote this review about 2 years ago and it's still getting likes occasionally, so I feel like I should add that I no longer stand behind this review and am kind of embarrassed of it. I do still think that Serano is largely clueless about class and race and it especially shows in Excluded, BUT I am annoyed with myself for writing a review that basically boils down to \"What about the trans people who aren't women??\" I now feel that binarism is flawed concept, as it posits that trans women are privileged in some way FOR being trans women, which is ridiculous. Anyway, I mostly agree with Serano's basic concepts in Whipping Girl, but I still think she's kind of a bad writer who should probably stop trying to be some like, social critic if she's going to say shit like, \u201cAs a white person, I never have to think about race, except on those rare occasions when I am in a non-white majority space\u2026 .But gender is different. Everybody has a gender.\u201d See: http://nataliereednewblog.wordpress.c... for more on this"}, {"userName": "Zanna", "userReviewDate": "Jan 07, 2014", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/22591633-zanna", "userReview": "I failed to distinguish personal interpretive note-making from writing for an audience here, and wrote too much about this book to fit into the space. The full review-summary is in three parts here:Part IPart IIPart IIINeedless to say, I found the experience too important and overwhelming to review properly. I'd like to highlight these descriptions:Transphobia is an irrational fear of, aversion to or discrimination against people whose gendered identities, appearances or behaviours differ from societal norms. Serano points out that this is often related to insecurity; since gendered identities are so rigidly policed.Cissexism is the belief than transsexuals\u2019 identified genders are inferior to, or less authentic than those of cissexuals. Cissexism occurs when people attempt to deny transsexuals the basic privileges normally associated with their self-identified gender, such as deliberate misuse of pronouns, refusing access to restrooms. The cissexist insists that cis genders are real/natural while trans genders are fake. Serano notes that this is incredibly na\u00efve: we make assumptions about other peoples genders constantly without ever seeing their birth certificates, chromosomes, genitals, reproductive systems, childhood socialisation or legal sex. This is particularly relevant to the exclusion of trans women by feminists \u2013 these excluders often behave as if it is necessary to be cissexual to experience gendered oppression as a woman. Attempts to \u2018third sex\u2019 trans people with words like \u2018transwoman\u2019 \u2018MTF\u2019 used as a noun are also cissexist, dismissing profoundly felt gender identities and ignoring the experiences that arise from being treated as a member of the sex the person has transitioned to. Trans is an adjective.Oppositional sexism is the root of transphobia, cissexism and homophobia. Serano introduced me to this term for the belief that female and male are rigid, mutually exclusive categories each with a unique, nonoverlapping set of attributes, aptitudes and desires. Those who fall outside gender/sexual norms are punished are dismissed to maintain the male-centred gender hierarchy.Traditional sexism is the belief that maleness as masculinity are superior to femaleness and femininity. This is also called misogyny. It occurred to me while reading, that radical feminism recognises traditional sexism (its core tenet, in my view, is the identification of this single meaning of gender as a structure in which male = better. I\u2019ve come to accept that this is only one of the many meanings of gender \u2013 there are as many meanings as we find and create in this field of signs...) but often reinforces oppositional sexism by failing to recognise it. The radical feminist endorsement of lesbianism is different, I think, from the LGBT movement\u2019s rejection of oppositional sexism: it is based on political solidarity between women, to some extent, against maleness.Trans-misogyny is the targeting of expressions of femaleness and femininity by men, gender queer people and trans women. The fact that all women can wear male-identified clothing without much comment, while men who wear women\u2019s clothing can be diagnosed with \u2018transvestic fetishism\u2019 is an example of trans-misogyny. When women\u2019s organisations and events open their doors to trans men but close them to trans women, that is trans-misogyny.According to Serano, trans women, who \u2018choose\u2019 to be female, represent the greatest threat to the male-centred gender hierarchy, and our sexist culture thus marshals all its forces against them. Trans women are hyperfeminised in the media in order to make their femininity appear artificial and to make them seem weak, confused and passive. The media also hypersexualises trans women, suggesting they transition mainly for sexual reasons. It also objectified trans women\u2019s bodies by focussing on and sensationalising sex reassignment surgery. Meanwhile, some in the feminist movement use the same tactics. While proclaiming \u2018women can do anything men can\u2019, we ridicule trans women for any perceived masculine tendency, such as speaking out. We complain about the standards and expectations men demand we meet, then dismiss trans women because they don\u2019t meet our own arbitrary requirements.And here's what I wrote about the chapter that I felt was most pivotal to my own thinking, followed by what I wrote on the one that I find most controversial:Blind Spots: On Subconscious Sex and Gender EntitlementIn a way this chapter has the deepest resonance for me, because I too have had a blind spot for what Serano calls subconscious sex, which is more usually confusingly called \u2018gender identity\u2019 or \u2018internal gender\u2019. Serano shares her own experience of recognising her trans-ness. Many trans people recognise their misgendering very early in life, and immediately insist that they belong to the sex other than the one assigned to them. Serano came to this realisation more gradually. At five or sex years old, she remembers knowing that she was physically male and that other people thought of her as a boy, but she had contradictory dreams and felt that something was wrong when going into the boys\u2019 toilets and when her class was split by gender. She points out that for children, gender identity is signed by preferences for activities, toys and interests. Her passion for dinosaurs and desire to be a major league baseball player were at odds with her feeling of girlness. She shares that it was only at eleven, dressing herself in a white lacy curtain, that on seeing her reflection she realised that it felt right, and made perfect sense, to see herself as a girl.All of the words available in the English language completely fail to accurately capture or convey my personal understanding of these events. For example, if I were to say that I \u2018saw\u2019 myself as female, or \u2018knew\u2019 myself to be a girl, I would be denying the fact that I was consciously aware of my physical maleness at all times. And saying that I \u2018wished\u2019 or \u2018wanted\u2019 to be a girl erases how much being female made sense to me, how it felt right on the deepest, most profound level of my being. I could say that I \u2018felt\u2019 like a girl, but that would give the false impression that I knew how other girls (and other boys) felt. And if I were to say that I was \u2018supposed to ebe\u2019 a girl or that I \u2018should have been born\u2019 female, it would imply that I had some sort of cosmic insight into the grand scheme of the universe, which I most certainly did not.Perhaps the best way to describe how my subconscious sex feels to me is to say that it seems as if, on some level, my brain expects my body to be female.For me, the penny drops right there. When I first discovered radical/gender critical feminism, I described myself \u2018gender agnostic\u2019, since \u2018I don\u2019t feel my gender\u2019. While I certainly feel very uncomfortable if I imagine transitioning to a male sex, I have been able to rationalise this as discomfort with the unfamiliar. But Serano has enabled me to recognise that this aspect of my body sense is much more significant and integral: I don\u2019t \u2018feel my gender\u2019 because I experience what she calls gender concordance: my body is the sex my brain expects it to be. Cissexuals don\u2019t notice this because, well, isn\u2019t the essence of comfort the absence of discomfort? Trans experience shows definitively that what Serano helpfully terms subconscious sex is a brain-based reality.For Serano, the experience of her female subconscious sex was not accompanied by the desire to explore female gender roles or to express femininity. It was not the result of social gender constructs, as it defied everything she had been taught about gender and the encouragement she received to think of herself as a boy and act masculine. She was considered a normal-acting boy, and her family was not particularly restrictive, so neither was the experience a reaction to strong gender policing. She argues that subconscious sex is independent of sexuality and gender expression. At first, she thought she must be gay (influenced by stereotypes) but she was further confused by finding herself attracted to women, not men. In the majority of instances, thinking of herself as female was unrelated to sexuality.After experimenting with cross-dressing, she lost interest in it, realising that her \u2018desire to be female had nothing to do with clothing or femininity per se\u2019. She later identified as bigendered, becoming an androgynous queer boy.I eventually reached the conclusion that my female subconscious sex had nothing to do with gender roles, femininity, or sexual expression \u2013 it was about the personal relationship I had with my own body.For me, the hardest part about being trans has not been the discrimination or ridicule that I have faced for defying societal gender norms, but rather the internal pain I experienced when by subconscious and conscious sexes were at odds with each other\u2026 sometimes it felt like stress or anxiousness, which led to marathon battles with insomnia. Other times, it surfaced as jealousy or anger at other people who seemed to take their gender for granted. But most of all, it felt like sadness to me \u2013 a sort of gender sadness \u2013 a chronic and persistent grief over the fact that I felt so wrong in my body.Serano points out that she gave up male and heterosexual privilege (she is married to a woman) to transition, but it was all worth it for the \u2018most important gender privilege of all: feeling at home in my own sexed body\u2019.Serano identifies gender entitlement, which can affect anyone, as the arrogant conviction that one\u2019s own beliefs, perceptions and assumptions regarding gender and sexuality are more valid than those of other people. This can lead to \"gender anxiety, the act of becoming irrationally upset or being made uncomfortable by the existence of those people who challenge or bring into question one\u2019s gender entitlement.\u201d This leads us to insist that certain genders or sexual inclinations are natural, and to demand than others curb or conform their own inclinations to meet our expectations. We must recognise that other people\u2019s genders and sexualities have no bearing on our own!Putting the Feminine back into FeminismSo, finally we come to what feels to me like a key question \u2013 what is femininity really about, if not about the subservience and passivity patriarchy projects onto it? Serano suggests that femininity has been perceived as a \u2018package deal\u2019 of gender expressions, traits and qualities. However, she notes, some women are verbally effusive and emotive (female-identified traits) but not feminine in their manner of dress, and vice versa\u2026\u201cThose who wish to naturalise femininity\u2026 describe feminine traits as though they were bundled in a single biological program that is initiated only in genetic females. Such claims gloss over the many people who have exceptional gender expressions\u2026 on the other hand, those who wish to artificialise femininity characterise it as a unified social program designed to shape women\u2019s personalities and sexualities\u201dIn the later case, by showing that one aspect of femininity is a sexist projection, one can claim that femininity as a whole is unnatural \u2018or it would not have to be enforced at all\u2019.This is a tempting idea for feminists, but I\u2019m feeling Serano here when she points out how simplistic it is, arguing that feminine traits arise from different combinations of biology and socialization. She described being told to smile by strangers after transitioning \u2013 an act of street harassment. Over time this diminished and she wondered why, concluding that she had learned to make less eye contact to avoid the harassment. Traits such as the preference for pink, are very obviously socialized, but others, such as being attuned to one\u2019s emotions, seem to be influenced by hormones as well as social expectations and learning.Above and beyond characterising femininity itself, Serano critiques sexist interpretations of it. For example, the desire to help others is interpreted as a feminine trait and taken to imply a duty for women to care for children. Feminine self-presentation is interpreted as existing solely to attract men, denying any possibility that feminine people might wish to adorn themselves for their own pleasure (there is a big issue of status and class that is left out of the discussion here). Serano notes that many men rarely notice new haircuts or clothes and are generally much more interested in bodies. The interpretation is male-centred and sexist \u2013 the behaviour itself is not.if we thought about the feminine traits of being verbally effusive and emotive not as signs of insecurity or dependence, but as bold acts of self-expression, then the masculine ideal of the \u2018strong and silent type\u2019 might suddenly seem timid and insecure by comparisonThe mistaken belief that femininity is inherently helpless, fragile, irrational and frivolous gives rise to the commonplace assumption that those who express femininity are not to be taken seriouslySerano finally discusses feminist interpretations of femininity. She distinguishes between unilateral feminism and deconstructive feminism. The former, identified with the second wave, views sexism as a simple matter of women oppressed at the hands of men. This view sees women as oppressed by belittling meanings and assumptions projected onto their bodies, and coercion into femininity, the product of subservience. A distinction between sex and gender allowed feminists to challenge the sexist ideas projected onto their bodies while ignoring negative messages associated with femininity. Some advocated androgyny as more \u2018natural\u2019 while others worked on a positive idea of \u2018natural\u2019 womanhood, which had to arise from biology rather than \u2018man made\u2019 femininity, which was denigrated.In contrast, deconstructive feminism focuses on oppositional sexism rather than traditional sexism. These feminists regard both gender and sex as socially constructed (an argument made by me elsewhere, which I stand by in general). It also artificialises femininity, emphasising the performance model of gender. They tend to argue that femininity is socially imposed, that most women are duped into believing that it is intrinsic, that people in the know realise that gender expression is highly malleable and therefore adopt a more radical antisexist gender expression (androgyny or drag for example), and crucially, that feminine women are enabling sexism and collaborating in their own oppression. This tends to put women with feminine inclinations off feminism.Serano suggests that this deconstructive feminism involves a degree of projection by people with somewhat exceptional gender inclinations. I'm actually unconvinced by this. She also argues that it is patronizing towards those to whom femininity \u2018feels right\u2019. The idea that \u2018femininity is artificial\u2019 is misogynistic: denigrating femininity has taken the cultural place of denigrating femaleness. While I feel sceptical about the extent of her critique of social constructivist perspectives, I do think that it is important to realise that femininity is never going to disappear: some behaviours and traits (though the behaviours and traits in question can certainly change just as blue was once a girl colour and is now a boy colour) will inevitably be female-identified. Serano\u2019s perspective clearly shows that the meanings projected onto femininity are sexist and artificial, and will continue to haunt all who are female and/or feminine until we embrace and empower female-identified expression, rather than demanding that women become or behave more like men."}, {"userName": "Sherwood Smith", "userReviewDate": "Jan 09, 2013", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/162084-sherwood-smith", "userReview": "I am beginning to wonder if \"It's good to be cis\" parallels \"It's good to be rich.\" Being rich makes all these other problems of life invisible--you want something? You get it. Or you order someone to get it for you. The wish is the deed. For the rest of us, the wish can be a receding mirage as we struggle to make a penny stretch, to squeeze time from job and other obligations, yadda. So, yeah, it's nice to be rich . . . but no one comes along and helpfully legislates that we all have to be rich.Books like this are demonstrating to me that cis = rich in that many of the problems faced by people who are not cis are invisible, just as all the problems we face in surviving are invisible to the rich.Well, that's enough of me maundering: to the book. Some have pointed out that it's \"trans 101\" but I think a lot of us cis people need trans 101.Serano sets out to debunk many of the myths and misconceptions that people have about transsexual women, as well as gender in general. What is deeply disturbing is how much malice is extended toward women who are discovered to be non-cis.She gets into reasons, among which is that people are targeted not only for their femaleness, but for their expressions of femininity. This scapegoating she speaks of also takes place in strata of the gay community, underscoring the fact that feminine = inferior on so, so many levels.The goal is to get people to be aware of gender entitlement. Does it succeed? I can't say--so much of what she talks about is new territory for me.

My viewpoint has changed as trans activism have become much more personal to me, and this book is the best \"education for trans allies\" book that I know of. Furthermore, it's really good if you've ever felt constrained by social gender constructions. Seriously--it's a lot of good thinking about where stuff comes from and how to deal with it.-----A friend recommended it to me; one really has to process her ideas a lot before dissenting, I think. I say this not because she presents things badly--indeed, her prose so far is quite organized and elegant--but because a lot of the value in the book so far is in absorbing her perspective.So far I've learned one thing that surprised me, but whose truth is evident: the way many men are squeamish about wearing feminine clothes, makeup and so on, is directly from a misogynistic fear of appearing feminine. It's as if we're the \"untouchable\" caste. I thought of it as practical, dismissive of excess, and so on, but never realized that women and queer people of all sorts would be \"untouchable\" because we're another species (because hey, I don't think of myself as less than a person even when I want to be pretty). The way people assume her femininity is a sexual fetish, among other things, says a lot about how society really thinks of women (and she does point out that trans men are largely ignored). More later.Later: Actually I don't know what else to write about it: it says so very much. One thing that really surprised me is the revelation that transsexual people who went through sex reassignment surgery and hormones were for a long time encouraged to hide their assigned sex (probably decided genitals at birth, not chromosomes). Which means that if every transsexual in society were to come out at once, people would probably not think they were so rare, and might be less inclined to be afraid of them. Also, Serano recounts horrible interactions with doctors and researchers, so much media *and* academic bias; it's all explained and I find the explanation convincing even before reading more sources. She does *not* focus on hate crimes.You could read this book, or ask me about it, if you want to know more (and I own a copy you could borrow).

Serano has such a clear analysis of the mechanics of the oppression of queers, trans people, and women, and how these interact for trans women. The first few chapters were also really useful for me in thinking about my internalized femme-phobia, and the ways that I enact that. I'm glad Serano is talking about the hatred of femininity. It's also been a special treat to read this book after simon, cause I get to engage with his underlining & margin comments. it's like reading it with him sitting next to me saying, \"ooh, i really liked this part.\" As a critique, i'd say that sometimes I feel like the author is a little ungenerous towards social constructionists. Her arguments about constructionism are not the most interesting parts of the book to me, and i think that the simplification of other's positions is a part of that. I don't think there are any social constructionists who would suggest that people are being \"duped\" into their genders, and what she describes as \"socially exaggerated\" sounds alot like how i've heard social constructionists talk about the complex interplay b/w society and our physical bodies."}, {"userName": "Carl Vine", "userReviewDate": "May 10, 2014", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/29813858-carl-vine", "userReview": "This book opens with a quote by Audre Lorde and, near the end, it references bell hooks to explain living as people on the margins. The latter example was the only time a woman of color living in 'white America' is acknowledged. As somebody with a PhD in Biochemistry, who has access to the time to read the political works of Lorde and hooks, Serano has failed to interrogate whiteness as an identity construct of power that seeks to further its dominance on all. Failing to understand her whiteness within 21st century multiracial but white supremacist academia, and citizenry within racial, imperial America (a nation-state of Eurocolonial occupation) Serano misses the mark on genealogy of gender intersecting Euro-domination discourses of race, anti-indigenous genocide, blackness and white masculinity. The book's only mention of Iran evaded discussion on American domination on global media coverage of international relations and global security. My disappointment is solely with Serano as an irresponsible writer. Presuming that she has privilege and access to grassroots trans and gender politicized community organizing in Oakland, I seriously question her understanding of class and race."}, {"userName": "El", "userReviewDate": "Dec 31, 2016", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/83144-el", "userReview": "I was lucky enough to be able to read the 2nd edition to Julia Serano's Whipping Girl. The original was published in 2007 and this 2nd edition was published just this year. I think it's important to note that the author herself points out in the Preface to the 2nd edition how much has changed since the book was published originally. That being said, I think it's probably best to get the newest available copy of this book because this is a topic that is important and yet so are the changes and current events that occur.This is an interesting collection of Julia Serano's personal essays about sexism and the ongoing troubling nature of femininity. While it's become quite common for literature to talk about femininity and masculinity and how problematic those terms and definitions are for everyone involved, Serano's book enters the arena from the perspective of transsexualism. For this fact alone the book is worth reading.I hesitate to write a complete review because, as a white, straight, cisgender woman, I'm in a position where issues that effect transgender men and women do not effect me in the same way. I like to consider myself to be an ally and advocate to the best of my ability, I am constantly reminded (and usually rightly so) that my privilege can only take me so far. I continue to try to educate myself and, most importantly, listen. I can also be effected by these issues, but I recognize it's different. So I am wary of trying to articulate my thoughts here as I'm sure someone will jump in and accuse me of all sorts of things. I will probably use wrong terminology at some point, despite my best efforts.The author states in her Acknowledgements: \"While many of the perspectives and concepts put forward in this book have originated with me, others are simply my interpretations of ideas that have been kicking around in the trans community for a while, or that have been previously expressed by others.\" This is an important statement, and I am glad Serano made it. This book is comprised of her personal essays based on her experiences, viewpoints, and opinions. NONE of that makes the text any less important. But there will be occasions that some readers may feel Serano has made great generalizations that are fundamentally problematic.The best part about this is that Serano is giving voice to these issues. Especially in 2007 (at least to my knowledge) there were not a lot of texts available discussing binary gender issues. The fact that Serano wrote about her experiences in the cis- and trans- communities shows how far we are coming, and I want there to be more. Serano also wants there to be more, and uses this book to discuss issues within media. Yes, there are lots of issues within media. I have a love-hate relationship with media because I find myself analyzing and deconstructing everything I read, and what does it mean that I find The Devil Wears Prada a great movie, or that You've Got Mail is a movie I love to watch when I'm not feeling well.Some more recent examples of problematic depictions of transgender in media include the 2002 HBO movie, Normal, and Jeffrey Eugenides's novel of the same year, Middlesex. On the surface it seems like, great, transgender and intersex conversations are beginning to happen! They're in the popular culture and mainstream! Exceeeeept... they were created by people who had no personal experience as a transgender or any personal experience in the transgender community. So what exactly are they saying or providing to the audience? Are they just propagating the same myths and misconceptions that the media has been putting forth all these years? Serano doesn't think they should be making these movies or writing these books at all, and that's where we kinda-sorta disagree. I know a couple people who found Middlesex personally liberating and changed their lives, and that's not something worth diminishing. Likely Eugenides didn't get everything right either, but he at least help start the conversation. Right? This is where I struggle because look at those words: \"at least he helped start\". PROBLEMATIC. Serano brought up wonderful points such as this. (I'll be honest that I am fascinated by gender in media anyway, so that's likely why I've latched onto it.)Especially interesting is the discussion of sexism and the scapegoating of femininity. An ongoing issue that touches everyone in some way, and it shouldn't be ignored. We should be talking about this. We should be talking about everyone that traditional feminism has overlooked and/or blatantly excluded. I am 100% on board with that. There's not a whole lot of diversity in Serano's book, I'll say that right now. I know, it's unfair to say that because the entire book is about transsexual issues. But, again, Serano uses the platform of personal essay which, at times, even read like blog posts, so her experiences also only cover a certain ground. She can speak from the perspective of someone who transitioned to a female, and we are grateful to have her voice. But there's not much she can share from females who have (or are thinking about) transitioning to males. There's maybe one comment about race in this book, which is again leaving out entire demographics, something that feminists hear about constantly, and so it was disappointing to have yet another one-sided perspective - though again, I need to point out again that this text is personal narrative based on Serano's experiences.Which leads me to remind myself and others that gender and sexuality is not a one-size-fits-all. I believe that is what Serano was also trying to get across. What has been Serano's experiences may not match my friend who within the last year has been taking hormones and now identifies as male. His experiences would not match Serano's. And someone else may not be able to relate to either of their stories. And that's okay. Again, the point is that we are listening, or at least many of us are. There's still a lot of listening to be done, and I hope more voices share their perspectives, their experiences, and that we continue to learn and grow together.If there's one thing we've learned this year with the American presidential election, there's no room for more divisiveness. Read and learn and, most importantly, don't forget to listen.I hope in another 10 years, or by the time the 3rd edition of this book comes out, our society will have taken even larger strides to be more inclusive across the board and Serano can write a new Preface based on those changes."}, {"userName": "\u83c1\u534e", "userReviewDate": "Nov 12, 2012", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/687791", "userReview": "I'm reading this five years after it was published (in 2007) and, it seems, after loads of people I know who have discussed this book specifically and also absorbed its ideas into their critiques of so many issues (particularly in discussions around transmisogyny), so it doesn't feel as fresh as I'm sure it would have when it was first published. Even so, it's pretty incisive. In Part 1, \"Trans/Gender Theory\", Serano disambiguates a lot of concepts that are confused in discourse around sex and gender, even in academia, by separating subconscious sex, gender expression and sexual orientation, and looking at how these identities relate to cissexism (assuming that cissexuals' gender identities are more natural, normal and unquestionable than transsexuals' gender identities), transphobia, oppositional sexism (basically maintaining gender categories as mutually exhaustive, exclusive and oppositional) and traditional sexism (devaluing women, femininity and femaleness in relation to men, masculinity and maleness). I feel that her writing and use of concrete examples would make this text fairly accessible for someone who doesn't have any pre-existing familiarity with these terms. Part 2 \"Trans Women, Femininity and Feminism\" seems to be a collection of shorter papers, and I can see from the notes that some of these have been previously published on their own. This part is more personal and stylistically more forceful, but I found it pretty repetitive. I guess I've read a lot of blog posts and articles by trans women that articulate similar ideas to the chapters in Part 2, while Part 1 develops a coherent theoretical framework that sets the stage (and creates the language) for the reflections in Part 2. The only real critique I have is that Serano spends much of the book rightly criticising how non-trans medical practitioners, feminists, filmmakers, novelists, sociologists, gender theorists and queer activists use trans women's lives as raw material to analyse or entertain without any regard for trans women's stories about themselves. But then in her discussion of non-Western gender categories such as berdaches (p 147-149), she refers to her own feelings about being \"third-gendered\", doubts the distinction between \"third genders\" and \"trans people who 'cross' from one gender to the other\", and characterises \"third genders\" as \"oppositional sexist attempts by society to marginalize gender-variant people\" without speaking to anyone who might identify as \"third gender\" or referring to any testimony or autobiography. Isn't that exactly the kind of appropriation and gender entitlement she decries? While definitely there is a romanticisation of non-Western \"third gender\" categories, and I would probably agree that in any contemporary society that has a \"third gender\" category, there would also be trans people who would prefer to be considered as part of the same category as cis people of their gender, it also seems like Serano is touching on this discussion to forward her own argument. She makes the same kind of evasive reference to people who might prefer a \"third gender\" identity over a transsexual one as the gatekeepers she criticises who brush off or ignore lesbian trans women whose orientation problematises their assumptions.

I know this is how many of us find one another, dance with the scars into arms that might hold not only to harm. When I came of age in the \u201890s, everything was binary. But the beauty of queer and trans analysis over the past few decades is that it has refused to create either/or categories, or, when not refusing, has refused to give in.\u201dserano contradicts herself frequently throughout this insanely under-edited text: sometimes passionately binary, at other times indifferent to such trifles. serano opposes opposition while pushing for rather explicitly politically divided embodiments: science\u2019s object and essence are given wide berth. as defined by fred moten, blackness tends toward an essentialism where essence and performance are not mutually exclusive. nowadays i\u2019m starting to believe that everything is nothing but performance, change, energy and movement, a la alfred north whitehead via deleuze. i can\u2019t believe i just typed that, i kind of hate delueze. people are reasonably frustrated and lost in such an idea of a performative trans since it suggests some kind of fraudulent agentive activity, or confirms the straight world\u2019s transphobic ruse: when i think of performance it\u2019s the decidable discreet metaphysical presence, motivated and non-arbitrary, behind the sign regardless, like judith butler gets from jacques derrida talking about ferdinand saussure, solidified and reified and calcified and sedimented with every single use and re-use and repetition within language itself\u2014 it\u2019s the play of a presence that is only there as long as you need it to be; this in our real world is as material and present as it always has been, is or ever could be. this performative refuses the treatment of lived experience and people with indifference; it is the very means of administration but also fugitivity. the performative is not a license to abandon real responsibilities, but an injunction to be fully present and real. is it possible to be cis and trans at the same time? emi writes:\u201cToday, Emi does not identify with any particular gender, but she does not so strongly identify with the state of having no gender to claim that as an identity either. Honestly, she thinks that having an identity--especially gender identity--is kind of weird: how she views herself depends on the human relationships and interactions that surround her, rather than arising from some intrinsic core sense of self.\u201don the trip of a prospective cis/trans simultaneity (even though i don\u2019t want to have to use the word \u201ccis\u201d ever again in life) i am reminded by a brilliant paper given by kai green on a black trans optic of darkness. this notion inspires in me the possibility for a pedagogic regard the kills administrative certanity through making space for what we may yet feel and already know. in that arrives and departs limitless enfleshments in a cogent, capable and responsible messiness of kin, perhaps modeled most infamously in chris vargas\u2019 broadsheet for the museum of transgender hirstory & art (MOTHA)\u2026"}, {"userName": "Max", "userReviewDate": "Aug 08, 2017", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/51162416-max", "userReview": "wildly self indulgent, often incoherent, manages to make some pretty colorful topics incredibly boring. odd and offensive takes on feminism. talks a lot and says very little worth refuting. i get it- you are very special and very smart. grateful to be finished reading this"}, {"userName": "Kira", "userReviewDate": "Nov 10, 2008", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/1622221-kira", "userReview": "I read most of this book in one night.

In which case.. Best. Book. Ever. **Update The preceding review is not really a critique in any way, just a reaction shortly after finishing the book.It has since occurred to me that the concept of \"unconscious sex\" is more of an anecdotal description of a way of feeling than anything which could be placed in a causal nexus to explain the \"aetiology\" of transsexuality. I'm sure that it could be broken down into phenomenologically valid experiences of at least some transgendered people, but.. a) Is it supposed to be the signal of one's true or authentic sex? That concept seems problematic to me now. b) If it is something like a number of repressed drives (the word \"unconscious\" suggests Freud's metapsychology), how does that link up with the concept of sex? If 'sex' is defined in opposition to 'gender,' as a scientifically discoverable property of bodies, and gender is an ensemble of gestures and 'scripts,' a \"cognitive style\" a la Schutz, where does that leave unconscious sex? It seems to resemble the medical category of \"gender identity\" as in \"Gender Identity Disorder\" (GID).  I'm pretty sure I read and/or heard the author, who I think is awesome, describe this book as a collection of personal essays, which would mitigate the force of the criticisms above. It wasn't her intention to defend her gender/sex against academic or medical theories of gender, which might explain the reactions of another reviewer's grad. school seminar to the book.

For the first time in my 27 years of being transgender, I saw myself reflected properly in print. Julia Serano was like a more experienced, smarter, older sister, showing me that it is ok to be myself, whatever shape that is. She showed me that we're not crazy, broken or disgusting, and some of us are clever and funny and capable. She deconstructed media representations that have troubled me since childhood and explained the origin of stereotypes that held me back growing up. She showed me a way that my experience can be reconciled with feminism and that femininity is both powerful and available to me, if I want it. She took ideas that had sat half-formed in my head for a decade and laid them out fully in front of me, suddenly untangled and comprehensible.

A book that you've owned for a while but haven't gotten around to readingI bought Whipping Girl on Kindle sale and then mostly forgot about it until a transatlantic flight when airplane mode limited me to what I already had downloaded on my Kindle. I've never read a book quite like this one and I think in the future it's going to be considered a seminal gender studies work of the 00s. Serano's unique background as both a trans woman and a scientist leads to a very coherent set of points. That said, at times, I found some arguments elucidated in a way that weakened them; and in 2017, nearly 10 years out from publication, there is definitely some material in here that is now dated."}, {"userName": "Lilia Ford", "userReviewDate": "Mar 01, 2017", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/10992009-lilia-ford", "userReview": "I'd call this a must-read for everyone concerned about transsexual/transgender issues, feminism, and intersectionality. Beyond the ideas themselves, I loved how accessible this is: Serano conveys complex issues in a highly readable style, without dumbing stuff down. This is by necessity one woman's perspective, but much of Serano's writings concern the inherent and valuable diversity of perspectives, experiences, values and opinions. Also, because she is my age, Serano was able to help me make sense of my own conflicts with the feminism of my formative years--dominated by Andrea Dworkin\u2014which drastically privileged certain aspects of female/feminist experience and condemned others to the point of dismissing them as false consciousness or supporting patriarchy. By embracing diversity, Serano argues we can leave off policing other womens' experience of sex, gender, and femininity, and agree to reject devaluations of femininity and female experience wherever we see them. Bottom Line: Essential Reading"}, {"userName": "Shea", "userReviewDate": "Oct 07, 2007", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/502324-shea", "userReview": "This book was recommended to me during a conference I went to for work back when I was with AmeriCorps, and I did not get a chance to read it until last week. I nearly forgot about the recommendation actually, but I stumbled across it while working and immediately decided to read it. Serano tackles two major issues in this book: 1) \"mainstream\" feminism in society and 2) transsexualism in society. The former I was very acquainted with and recognized many of the authors that Serano talks about, and the latter I admittedly knew little to nothing about. Serano\u2019s biography describes her as a biologist, writer, and a musician (in a band called Bitesize, which I highly recommend by the way)\u2026which makes her the only other person I know of, besides myself, who agrees that taking on three completely separate careers/passions is a totally acceptable method of living. Rock on sister. She\u2019s also a transsexual woman, and much of what she has to say can knock down the most self-identified \"liberal\" or \"open\" person into a continual state of thinking \"jesus, I had no idea.\" That is certainly what happened to me while reading this book, and I considered myself a staunch member of the most \"open\" group of people in the realm of individual liberty and happiness.While some may be willing to pigeonhole this work as a \"transsexual rant against society,\" it really isn\u2019t. While Serano manages to force just about anyone who doesn\u2019t (and probably in some cases, does) identify as transsexual to rethink their own misconceptions about gender identity, she also delivers a strong case against the so-called mainstream brand of feminism and argues that it has a lot of work to do before it can truly live up to the ideals it espouses at every \"womyn\u2019s rally\" and \"feminist day\" event it conducts.The strongest argument she introduces early on is the fact that femininity is largely demonized in our society and culture. She harps on this idea again and again and again throughout the work, and while it does become slightly monotonous (after the 93rd time I got it, really), I think her main intention was to make sure that her readers truly understood the argument because of how important it is in understanding the root causes of sexism and discrimination against transsexual women. She warrants this claim in a number of ways and one of the more compelling ways is when she points out that \"MTF transsexuals\" tend to experience way more scrutiny, harassment, and even fear of violence (both \"pre-\" and \"post-op\") than \"FTM transsexuals\". She cites a specific example in which a midwest \"womyn\u2019s festival\" openly accepts lesbians, bisexual women, transsexual men, and other women, yet it specifically excludes transsexual women. I actually had to read that one again to make sure I had read it correctly, and when she describes some of the justifications for such a blatant exclusion (like the idea that transsexual women have some sort of \"male aura\" simply because they were born male), I had to laugh at the absurdity of it.I\u2019ve offered a small glimpse into the topics that Serano covers because to describe every major subject that she touches on would be nearly impossible. She makes very compelling arguments in both the feminist and transsexual realms, and at the very least, she offers a very eye-opening glimpse into issues that many of us have never thought about before (I certainly hadn\u2019t). One of the only major downsides is that Serano is \"jargony\" at times, and while it does take some time to get used to the terms she creates and uses constantly throughout the work, I don\u2019t think it will be a serious defect for anyone interested in seeing what she has to say."}, {"userName": "simon", "userReviewDate": "Jan 25, 2008", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/831441-simon", "userReview": "this book is a breath of fresh air in the world of trans theory/non-fiction. personal and political, truly feminist all the way down. great critique of the objectification of trans people and bodies in the growing world of academic queer/trans studies. strategically argues for understanding the struggles for gender liberation as a coalition of allies rather than trying to fit everyone under one trans \"umbrella\". muscled it into my grad queer theory class to offer some balance to all the non-trans academics using trans people to prove a point about the 'construction' of gender. **so we read a chapter of this in my grad class. they ripped it to shreds. then i found myself heavily critiquing it too, while managing to defend some of the points. warning: it's not academic theory. it's political and feminist theory, but not queer/gender theory the way it is conceptualized in academia right now. which is maybe a shame, and probably will change, but as of right now, if you love this book, maybe you want to keep it out of the high-theory classroom.**- added 6/01"}, {"userName": "Rob", "userReviewDate": "Oct 03, 2016", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/9148406-rob", "userReview": "I was far to confused by this book to be able to give it any more then 3 stars. I freely admit I was unable to comprehend a lot of what she was writing about. I couldn't keep up with the amount of words strung together I did not understand. I guess I could have just opened a dictionary eh.That said, I still made my way through it simply unconcerned that there was some I wouldn't \"get\". There was a lot I did understand and it opened my eyes.Some of this book I didn't simply \"get\" but rather I loved!! there were pages where Julia poured her heart out and tried to convey to us the reader what it was that she found attractive in a Trans woman, I marked those pages for re reading at a later date.It was heavily bogged down with definitions and explanations on what she \"meant\" by certain terms but really that's sort of what the whole thing is really about.

Everyone everywhere is apparently depicting things in the wrong way. A little less aggressiveness would have made this smoother. I'll never dare say anything on the matter ever!

In this provocative manifesto, she exposes how deep-rooted the cultural belief is that femininity is frivolous, weak, and passive, and how this \u201cfeminine\u201d weakness exists only to attract and appease male desire.In addition to debunking popular misconceptions about transsexuality, Serano makes the case that today's feminists and transgender activists must work to embrace and empower femininity\u2014in all of its wondrous forms.", "title": "Whipping Girl: A Transsexual Woman on Sexism and the Scapegoating of Femininity", "url": "http://www.goodreads.com/book/show/29465033-whipping-girl?rto=x_gr_w_carousel_bp", "average": 4.2, "cover": "https://images.gr-assets.com/books/1457503016l/29465033.jpg", "reviews": 413, "authors": [{"url": "https://www.goodreads.com/author/show/328504.Julia_Serano", "name": "Julia Serano"}], "type": ["Feminism", "Nonfiction", "Glbt", "Gender", "Lgbt"], "outlinks": ["http://www.goodreads.com/book/show/29465033-whipping-girl", "http://www.goodreads.com/book/show/605663.Whipping_Girl", "http://www.goodreads.com/book/show/10345577-whipping-girl", "http://www.goodreads.com/book/show/25942967-whipping-girl", "http://www.goodreads.com/book/show/12792427-whipping-girl", "http://www.goodreads.com/book/show/17623891-excluded", "http://www.goodreads.com/book/show/32852990-outspoken", "http://www.goodreads.com/book/show/11024237-take-me-there", "http://www.goodreads.com/book/show/24819402-girl-sex-101", "http://www.goodreads.com/book/show/11520321-trans-love"]}
