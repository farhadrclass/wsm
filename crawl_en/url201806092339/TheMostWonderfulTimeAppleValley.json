The exception was the very first story. I could not believe a mother would not notice her kids for 3 years. The story also did not remedy Brandy in my eyes. I did not feel the least sympathy for her and felt like someone should have come and taking her kids away from her. She also did not deserve the hero. Maybe if the time had not been as long, I would have had more sympathy, but I felt was sorry for the kids and disgust at the mother. That story almost caused me to quit reading the book, however the other stories were good.

There's a perfect combination of sweet and sexy and each story had me smiling and in the festive spirit while I read them. It's a great introduction to authors you might not have heard of before, and who I am sure you will want to add to your list of authors that you want to read more from.CHRISTMAS PAST by Fern Michaels is a feel good story with such sweetness it will either make you want to grab the sick bucket, or like me, make you smile and put you into the festive spirit. Brandy lost her husband 3 years ago, and is a mess. She barely functions, and then it's only because she has two teenage children to look after. She hates Christmas because it was around then that her Christmas loving husband died. To even think of enjoying the festive season after his death is an anathema to her. Her children are rebelling, her house is a mess, and her funds are running out. Her best friend comes to the rescue though and tells her of a part time job that she would love. Necessity makes her take it and from there many changes start to occur for her. Ryan lost his wife 6 years ago. He has an eight year old daughter and she has more than helped him through his grief process. He's been going to a grief counselling group in the local library for years and it's there that he meets Brandy. Shockingly, for the first time since her husband died, Brandy feels attracted to a man. Can Ryan help her move past her grief, and perhaps be the new man in her life. A GLORY JUNCTION CHRISTMAS by Stacy FinzWhere the previous book in this anthology was sweet, sweet, sweet, this book was hot hot hot. Hannah Baldwin's ex is getting re-married, and although she is well and truly over it, it still sucks that all the preparations for the event are in her face 24/7. She hasn't got a boyfriend, hasn't really been interested in one either. Her marriage was hard work and she's been enjoying some time just for herself.Josh is Hannah's ex's best friend. The whole time they were dating, Josh made it known that he didn't like her. Most likely he was jealous because he didn't have his best mate to himself all the time. It annoyed Hannah a lot especially as there was a time before she even met her ex, that she quite fancied Josh. Anyway not long after the couple married, Josh joined the army. He was severely injured and has had to come home. When the two of them meet there are definite sparks of attraction there and it isn't too long before they act on them. Sadly Josh is still coming to terms with his 'disability' and Hannah can't cope with an angry boyfriend, she had a hard enough time with her angry husband. They decide maybe it's best if they just stay friends. Is that going to be possible? Can they sort through their emotional baggage and be more?MOONSHINE AND MISTLETOE by Sarah TitleWhat a great story this one it. My very first book with a gay wedding. Also a book with an ending that I absolutely wasn't expecting.It's setting is in a little ol' town that most people need to escape in order to make something of themselves. Abe, a musician has moved away in order to become famous in Nashville, but so far it just isn't happening. Emma is a certified Librarian, she loves all things books and she lives in big smoke. She has spent more time studying to be a Librarian including now writing a dissertation, than she has being an actual grass roots librarian. Abe's cousin Daniel, and his boyfriend, Emma's friend, Kevin are getting married. The event is what introduces the couple. Sparks fly between them, but they both need to focus on their careers, which means they both need to fight their attraction. Can they keep away from each other? We know for a fact neither of them want to change their futures.AN APPLE VALLEY CHRISTMAS by Shirlee McCoyAn enjoyable short story that makes you smile when our hard done by heroine finally gets some light in her life. It's a lovely feel good story with a little bit of Christmas magic thrown in and it's the perfect book to end this collection.Emma has been living with and looking after her father for the last 4 years when he was suffering from dementia. He was never an easy man to even like, and during his illness he was even worse. A stroke finally took his life, and the story begins at the cemetery just after the burial. Emma is one of 10 children, and not one of the others attended their father's funeral. None of them liked him, and weren't going to be hypocrites by making any effort to attend. Adam, one of her siblings would have attended if he could have, but he is in the army and abroad. He hated the idea of Emma being on her own, so arranged for his best friend to go to the funeral and then to stay with Emma at the house to help her settle things. She wants to sell all the antiques in the house, then the house itself. Jack MaCallister is in the business of antiques. He is the best one to help Emma sell everything, and to help her sort out selling the house. He is also Adam's best friend, and Emma's ex boyfriend from many years ago. They had mutually agreed to split up, but both secretly wished in hindsight that they hadn't. You can imagine Emma's shock when Jack turns up at the cemetery, late, but at least he was there. There first meeting wasn't a comfortable one and that was before Emma even realised what Adam had asked Jack to do for her!Will she accept Jack's help, will old feelings come to the fore, and can they both fight them, should they even try?

I just have to say this is the perfect book to ease you into the holiday spirit. Each story reinforced the belief in the magic of the holidays, and the joy in finding love. Each of these stories are truly heartwarming tales. This book is a must read, especially if you have a fondness for holidays, romance, or Hallmark movies because this book will make you think of all of those things.Fern Michaels is one of my favorite authors, I particularly love her Sisterhood novels. I believe this is the first holiday tale of her that I have read. This particular story had all of the elements you want to find in a feel good holiday read. While I truly enjoyed this story, I felt that it could have benefited from being a standalone book. I think the challenges her characters were facing were the perfect mix for a story of overcoming life\u2019s heartaches and finding your way back to the life you dream of. This was a sweet story, and that is probably why I wanted more. Because it was condensed you could predict pretty well the direction things were going, but that didn\u2019t detract from the pleasure of reading it at all. This is a lovely, light-hearted holiday story.Stacy Finz is new to me. I absolutely loved this story. I could picture myself walking through the streets of this town. This story is designed to get under your skin and make you fall in love with the characters. While there were some expected elements, she was able to propel the story forward and keep the reading wondering if the two main characters were ever going to get out of their own way. I could easily see this story, and the supporting characters being expanded upon and turned into a series (assuming she hasn\u2019t done that already). I think the additional characters each have a story to be told and a love to be found. I would absolutely love to read more!Sarah Title is another new to me author. I love her style of writing so much. This story was fantastic. The wedding scene brought tears to my eyes as I pictured every detail down to the fiddle. The setting and details were lovely and so rich you could practically see and feel every inch of this West Virginia town. The main characters were perfect. They were each quirky, humble, and real. You felt as if you were standing next to them as they began to learn each other. I was pleasantly surprised by what I saw as a twist to the ending. It kept the story from being typical and expected. I had anticipated them running into each other\u2019s arms, but the way the story actually ended was perfect for who they were and for their storyline. I loved everything about this one.Shirlee McCoy is another author I was previously unaware of, but you can believe I am a fan now. The best part about falling in love with this story is the fact that she\u2019s already created a series surrounding this family and town, and this was finally one characters much deserved spotlight. I can\u2019t wait to dive into the other books in this series. If you haven\u2019t read her work either this is a good place to start. Simply because it won\u2019t ruin anything for you to see this character finally get what she deserves. This story brought Christmas magic to life. It was a lovely reminder that true love will always be found again, even if you misplace it for a bit. There are just so many wonderful aspects to her writing. She breathes life into these characters, and you can feel their pain along with their joy. It\u2019s a magical experience for a reader."}, {"userName": "Kathy ", "userReviewDate": "Nov 21, 2016", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/8254902-kathy", "userReview": "This is a typical Christmas book. The four stories make good, not great, reading. There is nothing earth-shattering or unique about them. However, they make good holiday reading for the reader who enjoys spending time curled up with stories that strike the usual tone and follow the usual pattern, but definitely speak to the Christmas spirit and what it is all about. I enjoyed the first one, by Fern Michaels, most. I read other reviews where the reviewer did not like Brandy Heyers. Nevertheless, I did like her character. I could relate to her because, though I have not lost a husband, I have mourned the loss of a love for quite a while, and though I did not neglect my children during that time, as Brandy did (I had none), I neglected my family, my friends and a good segment of my life after my break-up. Brandy finally opens her eyes when she meets Ryan, whose wife has passed, though Ryan seemed to get on with his life and was not neglecting his daughter in his grief. I liked the way Ryan managed to bring Brandy out of her grief filled existence, mostly by just being himself. I think his eight-year-old darling daughter probably helped a little. In the second story, Hannah, whose husband left her and stopped the drinking that literally was ruining their lives and marriage, meets up with Josh, a returning wounded warrior. Both realize, once the fire that once was between them is rekindled, that things often come around, especially when circumstances change. In the third one, Emma Fallader, a doctoral student struggling to complete her degree dissertation, is not sure what to make of things when she meets Abe Tate, a hunky musician, at her gay friend\u2019s wedding, but things move quickly for the couple, as they both realize that what they were aiming for in life is not always they best direction to follow. In the last story, Emma Baily, who had been caring for her cantankerous father until his death, meets up with Jack McAllister, her old flame, as she sorts through her father\u2019s estate, realizing that the magic of the Christmas season sometimes spreads around to envelope those close by. Each of the stories was short and easy to read. The writing was well-done. Prior to this book, I was only familiar with Fern Michaels, as I have read and enjoyed many of her books. Now, I am adding the other three authors who also wrote the stories in this book to my list of authors to also read, as they are very enjoyable to read. As I said, the stories will definitely put the reader into a holiday mood. They are truly filled with the spirit of Christmas and provide an enjoyable break for everyday life.

The four novels deal with finding your own true love. Christmas Passed is the story of Brandy Heyers who has spent the last three years mourning the death of her husband, Jeff. While she has been mourning, she has been neglecting her house, her daughter, and her son. Is it too late to bring the three together as a family? Is Brandy ready to risk everything?A Glory Junction Christmas is the story of Hannah Baldwin having to face the wedding of her ex-husband and his girlfriend, Valerie. Hannah had sacrificed for years covering up for her alcoholic husband Chip and living with his anger. Finally after going through a recovery husband, he got out of the rehab center only to divorce Hannah and marry Valerie who had helped find this place. How is Hannah to cope in front of the entire town. She runs into Josh, Chip\u2019s best friend and who does not like her. She has to put up with Josh to avoid Chip and her remodeling of her life. Can she get through the wedding and truly forgive Chip and Val? Moonshine and Mistletle is a cute story about love which surprises you. Emma Fallader is headed to a winter resort with her best friends for the wedding of their friends Daniel and Kevin. Emma is a librarian who is studying for her dissertation and who plans on research. She and a family member of the groom\u2019s family, Abe Tate, get acquainted and find their path to happiness during the wedding. However, their career paths lead in different directions. An Apple Valley Christmas is the story of Emma Baily finding her way back to the joys of Christmas. Emma had spent the last four years of her life caring for her father. She was the only one of ten children who had promised her Mother she would not leave him alone. No one else cared about the bitter man who had spent his life throwing people away from him. In return for the horrible time he gave Emma, he left his house and everything to Emma. She doesn\u2019t want it. She wants to sell the house and get rid of it. Jack McAllister, her brother\u2019s best friend, has come to Apple Valley to help Emma when she sells out. He promised her brother he would do this with or without Emma\u2019s wishes.

I love small town Christmas stories, where everyone knows everyone and everyone's business and you pass the time with the friendships you've made. Emma and Jack were sweet, gentle, and caring. I like those stories.Moonshine and Mistletoe by Sarah Title: 5 starsDefinitely my favourite so far!! It was just a story of two people sweet on each other who slowly fell in love. Very little drama. Just two happy people crazy for each other.A Glory Junction Christmas by Stacy Finz: 3 starsThe first 50-70% of this book I wanted to rate it 5 stars, the last 30-40% I wanted to rate it 3. The love story was cute but I kept expecting Hannah to give some of Josh's crap back to him. Yes he went through a lot, but he kept pushing her away and she just kept running back. She was a little too desperate at the end. But I liked the history they had and aside from the prideful outbursts when Josh was in pain, he did treat her well.Christmas Passed by Fern Michaels: 1 starI really didn't care for this short story. Brandy was too self absorbed and mean in her grief over the loss of her husband. Her children were either isolating themselves or rebelling. HOWEVER Brandy wakes up after getting a job and decorating a tree for the first time in 3 years and apologizes to her kids and THE NEXT DAY they suddenly revert back to their old wonderful selves. The only real explanation given is that her best friend talked to them and worked some magic, or it's a Christmas miracle, something like that. SURE. This didn't feel Christmas-y; Brandy decorated a tree, Ryan got a real tree and gifted the kids puppies for Christmas and those were the only real bits of story that hinted at Christmas. Also the romance seriously lacked. This story is 95 pages long. They didn't even meet until page 60. They met at a grief counseling session and there were sparks. Yes, the very same day Brandy decides she needs the counseling because her grief is taking over her life. Prime time to meet the second Mr Right obviously. They have one date (immediately following said grief counseling session) and then their families spend Christmas together, book over.

Brandy is severely depressed after her husband dies and her children are paying the price. It's almost as if they've lost both parents instead of one. But Ryan sneaks into her life and helps her find the bright spots, one at a time. A very touching romance that just might make your cry.A Glory Junction Christmas is a fun read. Hannah's ex is getting re-married and it seems like she's the only one in town not invited to the wedding. Christmas just isn't as much fun when you feel like you're being left behind and left out. Josh is determined to see her happy and smile again. A sweet romance, but it didn't stand out as much as some of the others in this collection.Moonshine and Mistletoe is my favorite of the collection, by far. The whole situation that Emma and Abe find themselves in was perfect. It doesn't hurt that she's a librarian and he's a musician. The perfect pair in my mind. I can't even pick a favorite part, because I loved all of them so much! Great mix of humor, a little excitement, and the sweetest couple ever.An Apple Valley Christmas is another sad starting one, and it takes awhile to turn around. I loved the history of Emma's house. The house is almost a character in the story on its own. A little different than some of the stories I've read.
