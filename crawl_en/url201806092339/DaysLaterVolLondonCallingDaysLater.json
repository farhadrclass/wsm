And this graphic novel is a great side story to compliment the films. I love how it began with flashbacks of the movie - to see certain memorable frames depicted on paper in fantastic illustrations was awesome. I like how this series will follow Selena and her storyline post-28 Days Later, and look forward to what Nelson has in store for the next volume. One aspect which I thought was great was the use of flashbacks to show the contrast between Selena's current life and her life prior to the Rage Virus outbreak."}, {"userName": "Ashley Marie", "userReviewDate": "May 20, 2017", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/9525996-ashley-marie", "userReview": "I love that we get to follow Selena.

It was different then, though. I first watched these movies when I was 16, which was 8 years ago already! (good god\u2026) The Walking Dead hadn\u2019t blown out of the water yet, so zombie-themed movies and books were scarce (not altogether, but far more than they are now) and harder to come by. But, I\u2019ve always been a particularly good finder. (Okay, I\u2019m not actually a Hufflepuff, but it\u2019s a close second. If I weren\u2019t popping a squat in the Ravenclaw common room, I would 100% be in the Hufflepuff one.)Anyway, I\u2019m getting off topic. The point of all this is that I really like these 2 movies. Although, I will say that the first one is far better than the second, but I still recommend watching both. So, when I came across this companion comic series, I knew I had to read it.Synopsis(of both)Selena, as seen in the movie 28 Days Later as one of the main protagonists, is in a refugee camp and, there, is approached by a journalist who wants to get inside London, but more broadly even the UK will do, in order to report what\u2019s happening there so the rest of the world has some idea of what\u2019s happening and why it was evacuated and shut down. After much convincing, Selena finally agrees to head back into enemy territory and fight to expose the truth.This series takes place sometime between the 2 films. Watching the first film is not vital to familiarize yourself with the story before reading this series as it\u2019s a completely new story, but I highly recommend you do to get some grounding about who everyone is and what\u2019s been happening.28 Days Later, Vol. 1: London Calling by Michael Alan Nelson and Declan Shalvey\u2605\u2605\u2605\u2605Genre: Comic Series/Post-ApocalypseRelease Date: March 2010Source: ComiXology \u2013 Borrowed\n28 Days Later, Vol. 2: Bend in the Road by Michael Alan Nelson, Declan Shalvey, and Marek Oleksicki\n\u2605\u2605\u2605\u2605Genre: Comic Series/Post-ApocalypseRelease Date: June 2010Source: ComiXology \u2013 BorrowedI had no idea what to expect going into this series. I didn\u2019t even know these comics existed until I came across them on comixology.com and read the 2 they had available straight away.My experience could have gone either very well or very badly, as I\u2019ve enjoyed the movies for so long\u2013long enough to be a bit (okay, a lot) nostalgic about them. I\u2019m glad that I ended up enjoying this read.This was a good story that was fun to read. Although, I will admit the premise of getting Selena back into London was pretty unbelievable. After she fought so hard to get out, I don\u2019t think she would have gone back in for anything. I really don\u2019t. Especially given that this comic doesn\u2019t mention much about her new companions and, especially, her love interest of the movie. The comics paint her far more of a hardass than she actually was.That being said, Salena is such a great character, so I did really enjoy getting to know more about her. I was really enjoying seeing her develop further and how she dealt with all the other characters. (Even if the writers did draw on her early film self versus her later film self that became far more soft and found something to live for).Despite my complaints about the way the characters found themselves in enemy territory, I did really enjoy the plot once things took off. It had good pacing, excellent character development, and plenty of fight scenes. I thought the story progressed nicely from volume 1 to volume 2. I read them in succession, so it\u2019s hard for me to separate where one ended and the other began. Still, I know the transition was seamless and had well-written cliff hangers.It was very awesome to see a story I love in a different medium. I loved the artwork. I loved the dark colors (almost muted, but not quite) and the detail. Everything about it was very similar to how dark (no I\u2019m not talking plot-wise; I\u2019m talking actually dark) the movie scenes were.I just really loved mostly everything about this story and enjoyed reading it. I recommend both the movie duolagy and this comic series to anyone who, like me, still likes zombies. I\u2019ll be continuing on to volume 3.Review originally published on my Wordpress blog Dreaming Through Literature."}, {"userName": "Khaalidah Muhammad-Ali", "userReviewDate": "Dec 09, 2012", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/7003131-khaalidah-muhammad-ali", "userReview": "I loved 28 Days Later (movie), the quintessential new age zombie movie. Lots of action and even better characters. I loved the play between the Selena, she edgy and toughened by hard experience and Jim still somewhat naive and willing to view the screwed up world he woke up to as one with a glass half full. When I found out there was a comic over a year ago, I read the first installment, was not all that impressed, and decided to wait until it had reached completion. I read all 24 installments (6 volumes) in a single day. I loved it.Selena is the same as ever. I am tempted to say that she is very much like Michonne of The Walking Dead, but as 28 Days Later (movie) came out in 2002, a full year before the first publication of The Walking Dead comic, that would be wrong. Michonne is like Selena. Nevertheless, I like them both for the same reasons. Besides being a woman of color not portrayed in the stereotypical way, Selena is strong, gutsy, intelligent, and has an amazing survival instinct. She is full of attitude and on occasions is very sweetly vulnerable. The 28 Days Later Comic follows Selena as she is propositioned by an American reported to help him get back into London. He wants to write a story about the repatriation of London and what he feels is a bit of a conspiracy. Selena initially refuses but then changes her mind. All but Selena and the reporter, Clint die on the trip back through infected territory. And they have more than a few infected to worry about.They are bombed by soldiers wishing to keep them out of infected territory, almost all of their group is killed in said attack, one of their numbers goes blind in said attack, another one of their group is bitten precipitating an awesome and characteristic hacking to death by Selena, they are captured by a crazed murdering self appointed \"king\" in gang territory, and Selena is being tracked by a British General who wishes to exact revenge on her for the death of his men (from the movie...). I appreciated the length of this series which serves a the perfect segue to the 28 weeks later movie. I like that, unlike The Walking Dead, it runs low on vulgarity and the gore, while definitely present never icked me out. I don't know, perhaps I'm getting old, but as much as I like The Walking Dead comic some of the scenes are unnecessarily graphic and difficult for me to stomach.I did not like that there was little to no mention of Jim in the comic. I think there was the suggestion that he had been put to death for killing the sick corrupt disgusting soldiers who were bent on raping Selena and Hannah (movie). If that is true, then it is altogether unacceptable that such a thing should occur. And considering how close Jim was to Selena, I can not understand why she never even thought of him. She had plenty of flashbacks about her life pre-outbreak. I didn't like that there was little mention of Hannah either. I think she was adopted in Germany(?). I also wasn't fond of the developing relationship between Selena and Clint. Don't get me wrong, considering the circumstances, I get it, but its old. Man+Woman=Love Stop already. Does every happy ending have to end in this way?Overall, I enjoyed this a ton and I thought it was awesome fun to read."}, {"userName": "Jedhua", "userReviewDate": "Jul 11, 2015", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/34694932-jedhua", "userReview": "[Selena is a survivor of England's zombie outbreak \u2013 one that ravaged much of the globe. She remains haunted by all she has seen, the loved ones she\u2019s lost, as well as what she has had to do to survive. After a visit from the esteemed and dedicated war correspondent Clint Harris, Selena agrees to accompany him and his team (consisting of Trina, Derrick, Hirsch, and Acorn) deep into infected territory in an attempt to expose the information the government has kept under wraps concerning the outbreak. Harris\u2019 initial plan was to take a helicopter to Scotland \u2013 one of the few places where the quarantine is weak enough for them to slip past \u2013 and from there catch a Navy boat into London. There, Harris expects to be uniquely situated to get the inside scoop on the situation. Selena meets the crew on the chopper, but before arriving to their destination, they are forced by American fighter jets to land prematurely. Because of this, the group was forced to face many hardships on the ground before finally boarding the boat. Fortunately, Selena\u2019s many skills and ruthlessness made survival possible. Still, when Hirsch was infected by the virus, in order to protect the group, Selena had no choice but to kill him immediately. This put Selena on bad terms with Derrick and Trina, with the latter actually attempting to have her killed. According to Harris, Derrick\u2019s trust issues concerning Selena were likely bad enough, due to his traumatic experiences as a war hostage. Even in the face of that, Selena is able to lead and escort the group to the safety of the boat, make peace with Derrick, and single-handedly save Trina\u2019s life along the way. On the boat, everyone is able to restock on guns, ammo, and general equipment for the long road ahead. Very soon, however, the group again finds itself in hot water; American Navy vessels begin to approach their position. When an attempt to make contact by the Americans is made, Selena and her group ignore it, and retreat out of firing range. However, this does not save them from being bombarded by what appears to be another American fighter jet. The boat is destroyed by the jet\u2019s missiles, but Harris, Selena, and Derrick, are able to make it out to shore of Scotland alive. Selena confirms the death of Trina, but the crew of the Navy vessel, as well as the remaining two members of Clint\u2019s group are assumed dead. After tending to Derrick\u2019s wounds, Selena finds that he has been permanently blinded. After having set up a campfire, Selena and Harris discuss the feasibility of carrying Derrick any further through their journey.

England, Scotland, and Wales have been quarantined due to the Rage Virus, but reporter Clint Harris plans to lead a team from the islands of Scotland to London to report on the situation. Clint has convinced Selena to return to England as the party\u2019s guide\u2026despite her misgivings. When the plan goes sideways, Selena, Clint, and Derrick find themselves in a fight for survival...and the Infected want them dead.Written by Michael Alan Nelson, 28 Days Later 1: London Calling is a comic book continuation of the 2002 film by Danny Boyle. The series features art by Declan Shalvey and has also been collected in an omnibus edition.28 Days Later was a great movie with a ton of action and horror. The movie really reinvigorated the zombie genre (for better or worse) and led to a change in perspective on zombies by introducing the \u201crunning zombie\u201d...and a new level of horror. Much of 28 Days Later\u2019s thrills came from the kinetic nature of the movie. Here that energy has to be brought to the page. It doesn\u2019t quite reach that level.I have a hard time with the basic set up of this story. Having seen the horrors that Selena endured to survive the Rage Virus, there is no way in hell that she would return to England regardless of some unfinished personal business (like some Christopher Walken war survivor in The Deer Hunter). I wish that Nelson had come up with a more realistic way to force the character back into the story.This first volume does have some great art. Declan Shalvey was an up-and-comer at the time and does some great work trying to build suspense within a comic. The biggest challenge Declan has is that adaptations like this limit the artist a bit in that they already have imagery assigned to the zombies and Selena, but he does a good job here.28 Days Later isn\u2019t a bad comic, but it doesn\u2019t compare to the movie. The story unlike the film takes a lot of set up and there isn\u2019t the get up and go you came to expect from the film. While 28 Weeks Later was a big disappointment, this series falls somewhere between. It isn\u2019t disappointing, but it also isn\u2019t the thrill a minute you\u2019d hope for. 28 Days Later 1: London Calling is followed by 28 Days Later 2: Bend in the Road."}, {"userName": "Rafa Castillo", "userReviewDate": "Dec 25, 2015", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/27653430-rafa-castillo", "userReview": "Dios...

Action packed, bloody fun, and yes basically a rehash of the movie's themes, although the foe number 2 above is much deadlier. I look forward to the next installment."}, {"userName": "Penny Ramirez", "userReviewDate": "Aug 18, 2010", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/2383157-penny-ramirez", "userReview": "Good artwork. Excellent storyline. The full title is 28 Days Later: London Calling - this picks up where the first movie ended, with some reporters/camera crew trying to get back to London, which is in the quarantine zone. They find Selena, a survivor of the original infection, and convince her to be their guide. Mayhem ensues.... Presumably there will be many more issues, as this left off at a major dangling point!"}, {"userName": "Heather", "userReviewDate": "Dec 06, 2013", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/1444915-heather", "userReview": "After reading the last volume first I wasn't too interested in picking this series up but I'm glad I did. I like that the story follows Selena and her adventures traveling back to London which is still swarming with infected while the rest of the world is seemingly doing fine. The best part so far with this series is that the reader gets to learn more about Selena, a character that I have always admired for her strength and resilience. I highly reccomend this series for any fan of the movie."}, {"userName": "Michael Stokes", "userReviewDate": "Feb 02, 2017", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/11861868-michael-stokes", "userReview": "Exactly what you'd expect form the adaptation of this movie series. If you love the tropes of zombie lore, you'll this. Some of the dialogue is predictable, which is not uncommon in graphic novels these days. Not afraid to push buttons, very few punches pulled. I look forward to the next installment."}], "description": "The film that changed horror forever continues here! Selena and her new comrades struggle against the infected, the American presence in the UK\u00e2\u20ac\u00a6and themselves.
