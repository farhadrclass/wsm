The corpse is so old the only sacrifice sufficient to the occasion is a human one. Anita refused an got plenty of troubles as a result. At the same time something undead kept killing people wholesale and Anita, being a part of police Spook Squad had to find culprit and lay it to final rest as well as get the creature's creator. During her investigation she managed to piss off a powerful voodoo priestess and got plenty of troubles as a result. At the same time the Master vampire of the city unsuccessfully tried to get a date with her. Failing his wish could result in (you guessed it) plenty of troubles. This book is better than the first one. The stupid parts of the plot are gone - almost. Also gone are boring characters: I am looking at you, Edward. The plot was moving with decent speed never leaving me bored. There were some genuinely creepy moments as well as gruesome ones. The latter showed me I became immune to such: modern news took care of it. Name me any day and I will find more sickening stuff in real life than a description of a bloody toddler parts scattered around.We - humans - suck and can be very sick. One minor nitpick I would like to mention: for a self-proclaimed Vampire Executioner Anita did not do a whole lot of vampire executions this time (so you have no reason to worry, Buffy). This might be a good thing as vampire suck - both literally and figuratively. Figuratively speaking I think they overstayed their welcome in popular culture: sparkling and non-sparkling kind. By the way in case anybody doubt Anita Blake is an ancestor of Kate Daniels: one scene in this book has strong resemblance of that in Magic Binds. I am talking about the scene of Anita trying on a bridesmaid dress. So I liked the book well enough to rate it with 4 stars. Your mileage may vary. To each his (her) own. Tastes differ; I am even willing to admit my taste in literature in non-existent. And so on."}, {"userName": "Meredith Holley", "userReviewDate": "Sep 24, 2012", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/1302775-meredith-holley", "userReview": "[image error]"}, {"userName": "Jilly", "userReviewDate": "Nov 01, 2015", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/25894509-jilly", "userReview": "When I read the Kate Daniels series, I would see a lot of reviews that compared her to Anita Blake, and Kate would always come out on top. I could see some similarities, obviously, but I find Anita a little disappointing in how dumb she is. She really doesn't know how to shut the hell up so that someone would NOT want to kill her for a change. \n\"I'm going to kill you,\" he hissed.\"Take a number,\" I said.\nShe'll need to buy more number machines if she keeps up this pace of pissing people off...I mean, seriously, this woman threatens and antagonizes everyone she meets. It just isn't smart. Can't she just simmer with rage and kill people in her head like the rest of us do? now, that's a healthy attitude!So, in this book, there are a boatload of people who want to kill Anita. She's trying to help the police with a murder investigation and her standard way of interviewing people goes along the lines of this: Anita: \"Did you kill people?\" Person: \"no\". Anita: \"Well, I think you are a terrible person and should die, so I will be killing you as soon as possible.\" Person: \"Not if I kill you first.\"Anita:\"Did I mention that you are ugly and that I had sex with your mother? Also, I'm going to kill you.\"Person: \"Alright this is getting personal, now I'm going to torture you and then kill you.\"Anita: \"I'd like to see you try, bitch!\"Person: \"Lady, I'm just trying to take your order. Do you want fries with that or not?\"And, then she is shocked when people keep trying to kill her! In this book, an old Voodoo lady tells her straight out that she is going to send a zombie to Anita's house to attack her while she sleeps that night. That night, lo and behold, a zombie tries to kill her. Then, Anita acts all shocked about it. That seems a little dumb to me. I mean, the lady was pretty clear on the plan. It really shouldn't have been shocking at all. I think that Anita has so many people telling her they are going to kill her each day that she can't keep up with all of the threats. She needs one of those day-planners to keep track. That's what they had back in the 90's right? When people still had to use pen & paper for stuff. Fucking barbaric!Anyway, I have to say, despite it all, I am still entertained. I'm going to go on to the next book to see how many people try to kill Anita in that one. Also, I'm intrigued by her fashion sense. Don't worry, I will be discussing that in greater detail in my next review. There has been mention of a fanny-pack. That is just too good to devote only a sentence or two on. It deserves the star treatment in my next review."}, {"userName": "HFK", "userReviewDate": "Feb 15, 2016", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/52263626-hfk", "userReview": "Buddy read with Jessica. Our Anita Blake marathon continues with the second installment in the series.One of the key things while reading this series is to remind myself of it being the product of its time, it makes it easier to forgive the overused, familiar elements and go with the flow. A lot has happened since the first publication, but going back to the past also shows how little anything has really changed within the genre. The development is astonishingly minimal in many ways.I liked The Laughing Corpse much better than the first installment; Guilty Pleasures. It comes from having more supernatural elements, more gory details, more darkness, more world building with more action packed binding. It was an easy, fast read albeit not consistent with its flow and pace, which is most likely due to writing that still continues to be shockingly unedited, and just not very good with its repetitiousness.I am still unsure of what to make out of Anita Blake as a character. She has few traits that are appealing to me, but mostly she comes across judgemental and unlikable character. This, however, continues to be an nonissue. But what I would like to know is what is up with all this repetitive gun touching, gun thinking, constant problems with sweat that seem to be a medical condition to each character, and not least to Anita herself. This makes me suspect the coming sexy feast will be awkwardly written sweaty rain."}, {"userName": "Words", "userReviewDate": "Dec 28, 2007", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/638116-words", "userReview": "There was something about Hamilton's first, then second book that irritated the hell out of me, but I couldn't quite figure it out. Then one day I saw a picture of her on the book and I understood what it was. It annoys me when authors make themselves the hero/ine of their books, and then just change the name and the environment to make it fantasy fiction. But even more so when you must keep reading about how powerful, and how unconsciously sexy, and how tough that character is (*why* is she trying to prove how gutsy she is to other male officers..by playing around with a dead baby's body parts?). What flaws she does have are laughable - like I care that she *almost* gave in to Jean the vampire's advances despite her no-sex-til-marriage vow.Maybe subsequent books get better."}, {"userName": "Tilly Slaton", "userReviewDate": "Oct 27, 2011", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/6289182-tilly-slaton", "userReview": "This book took my by surprise!I have read it twice now, and there are parts that are still heart-wrenching. In the second book of the Anita Blake series, The Laughing Corpse rips you from reality and tosses you unexpectedly into a world of voodoo, betrayal and forced submission.Following the first book, this begins centered around Anita Blake and her job as an animator as well as the consulting work she does for the paranormal police division that investigates homocides that are obviously performed by something other than human.The murder scenes are quite gruesome. I found myself continuing to hold my breath while my heart pounded in my chest. Almost saying to myself .. \u201cOh nono please ..\u201d And reading as quickly as possible to find out if what I was dreading would be true.Anita is confronted by an old voo doo priestess that scares the living hell out of anyone nearby, and even those whom feel they are unreachable. Safe. Unfortunately, sleeping in bed, quietly and feeling safe, relaxed .. the nightmares can still find you. Death can still come crawling through your windows.The twists of betrayal, and sudden insights of a friend that leaves Anita unsure if the friendship will continue. Other friends are forced into life or death decisions, forced to consider crossing their moral lines of what is and what is not acceptable.The end of the book was somewhat rushed, and as climatic as it was .. I was left wanting. Cliff hangers are a wonderful thing I suppose, but I wanted more. I wanted so much more than what the ending offered me. Kudos to the author, I\u2019m 1/4 into the next book I recommend this read to anyone interested in bloody and gruesome books that are centered around the paranormal and the slight progression of possible romantic relationships."}, {"userName": "Donna", "userReviewDate": "Jan 19, 2016", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/13244359-donna", "userReview": "I like these books. They are fun and entertaining. I like the MC, Anita. There certainly are character traits that annoy me about her, but they aren't deal breakers. I can't ever take this type of urban fantasy seriously. But with that said, the author has a way with words in her descriptive strokes. Sometimes it has me rolling my eyes, but mostly she does a great job of taking descriptions and adding layers to them. That is what I like the most. This is the 3rd book I've read by her and I have thought this same thing about each of them.So far, the entertainment value of these are fairly high, but I have to say the same thing about the negative reviews. They are a riot to read. I laugh because I actually agree with their grievances, but apparently it hasn't sucked the joy out of these books....at least not yet anyway."}, {"userName": "Crystal Starr Light", "userReviewDate": "May 03, 2012", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/3990525-crystal-starr-light", "userReview": "[And I so didn't care for how the killer Zombie ended up tying into the Gainer subplot.

I would love to see this on TV (it would be terribly gory, even worse that The Walking Dead, I'd have to skip those parts, I have a weak stomach).Anita Blake is once again in trouble, this time she has to deal with some kind of meat-eating zombie, she doesn't really know what it is, and she fears it may be the worst thing she will ever have to catch. This monster ate a family of three members, leaving only blood splattered everywhere and a few half-eaten remains (yum!). She also gets another job proposal, this time from a very dangerous man called Harold Gaynor, who offers her a million dollars to raise a 300-year-old corpse. However, to raise a dead body this old she must sacrifice a \"white goat\", aka a human being. Evidently she refuses to do so, as it breaks all moral codes she has. Gaynor doesn't take her refusal well. (let's keep it that way)The third person who threatens Anita's life is the voodoo priestess Senora Dominga Salvador, a very dangerous woman who Anita suspects has had a hand in raising the zombie who's been murdering families. Dominga Salvador wishes to train her, to make Anita reach her true potential. Again, Anita refuses to have anything to do with her, especially after she sees what Dominga has hidden in her basement.Also, there is still the remaining problem with vampire Master hottie, Jean-Claude who wants Anita to become his human slave. Trust me guys, there a lot of wtf/mind-blowing moments...Again, I really enjoyed myself, LKH is a master at keeping me thoroughly addicted and at the same time completely grossed out. This series is definitely not your cup of tea if you don't like to read stuff about corpses getting eaten or ripped apart, as these kind of things tend to happen a lot.

Certain scene descriptions were disgusting and consequently depressing.So far, this series is not what I expected. It is slightly grittier and not the least bit upbeat, but more along the lines of what I expect from quality dark urban-fantasy. I enjoyed this book more than the first, largely due to being more familiar with Hamilton's world and characters, something which is typical of long running series. The first books are usually the weakest. I desperately want to jump into book 3 but am pacing myself.

Because she is an animator/nercromancer, there are also far more zombies than I'm used to in the genre. How is it that I can lurve the vampires and feel so ambivalent about the zombies? I just don't understand their appeal.Nevertheless, Anita experiences what so many (if not all) UF heroines do--they suddenly find hidden depths to their powers which solves their current dilemma, but opens a whole can of worms, to be explored in further volumes.

The Laughing Corpse digs deeper into Blake\u2019s world, shows off more of Jean-Claude, Ronnie, and the polices characters.As always, Anita is surrounded by problems with no immediate, easy solution in sight. Emphasis isn\u2019t placed heavily on her vampire slaying, more with her job as an animator. The suspense and story is strong from the beginning; action begins immediately and never lets up. The ending is one of the strongest out of the series, nearly knocking me to the floor with its intensity.The voodoo priest as the villain is also one of my favorites out of every book. She\u2019s dark, creepy, and as evil as they come \u2013 her showdowns with Anita were brilliant.Jean-Claude still isn\u2019t shown much, which is a shame. The chemistry between him and Anita is amazing; Hamilton plays up on it heavily and it\u2019s always thrilling to me, in more ways than one, to read their exchanges. This time around Jean-Claude wants something else from Anita (I won\u2019t give away spoilers) and seeing her run from it is great fun.Hamilton consistently writes with a light, humorous hand while dealing with dark, depressing material. The characters she has written about are strong, unique in their own ways, and goal-driven.I enjoyed this one even more than the first \u2013 it keeps getting better, not an easy feat to pull off. I can\u2019t find much fault with it, great stuff. The Anita Blakes are also rich in mystery; it somehow manages to come together at the end, remaining secretive and mysterious throughout the novel.The gore is pretty heavy, particularly the death scenes.

The Laughing Corpse is book #2 and focuses almost completely on Anita's zombie raising duties and her job helping the police on Spook Squad. This book is horribly gory and disturbing. I originally read it back before I had children and am relieved that I didn't attempt to read it when they were toddlers. That's all I'm sayin'.In this book, Anita is called in to help with a murder investigation. A family has been attacked and it appears it is the work of some sort of up hyped up super zombie. While investigating the case Anita is being pressured to raise a long dead zombie for a million or so bucks. She refuses because she'd have to sacrifice a human in order to do so. This Anita has morals and she's sticking to them.There is a lot of action here but way too much description when it comes to Anita's guns (snore) and attire. Seriously, are there readers out there who really care what color the \"swishies\" are on her many pairs of Nike's? Jean-Claude makes a few appearances and attempts to seduce her with his other-worldly eyes and puffy shirts but this Anita still kills vamps and doesn't date them. Many characters are introduced here that I don't remember. Anita has quite a few girlfriends, sidekicks and co-workers who disappear in the later books. Despite my complaining I enjoyed this book quite a bit. It's very morbid but has the dark-edged wit that the later books are lacking."}, {"userName": "Ahrcadia the Duck Tamer", "userReviewDate": "Dec 23, 2009", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/2483913-ahrcadia-the-duck-tamer", "userReview": "Whoever said that the Anita Blake books just get better as you go was wrong. This was far worse than the first mediocre book in this series, and the only redeeming factor was the last third. The beginning was so boring, in fact, that it couldn't hold my interest long enough for me to read more than a few pages at a time.I only hope that this series starts looking up, because my brother bought the first eight or so books, and it feels like such a terrible waste not to read them, since he never did.Slow paced, dumb, and quite lacking in motives where most of the characters are concerned, I wouldn't recommend this book to anyone with a lack of patience. Or, for the matter, a ton of it. The book sucked, plain and simple, and both stars were for the last third, with the exception of the ending, which sucked almost as much as the beginning.And for a book about vampires, there was a startling lack thereof."}, {"userName": "Christy", "userReviewDate": "Dec 02, 2009", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/409348-christy", "userReview": "I know a lot of people love the Anita Blake series, but I don't think I'll be one of them. I really dislike the main character. Why must I read over and over again that she's just so tiny and petite and yet tougher than she looks? Once per book would be way too much and it's in at least every other chapter. And why do I care what she's wearing? Anita is not likable. I understand that later on in the series she turns rather slutty, and I'm thinking I might just skip ahead to those books, if I read any more at all, just because that would at least be entertaining. I can't imagine her falling for anyone other than herself, though. The gory scenes are pretty gross and disturbing, as they should be I guess. Did the monster really have to gut a little boy though? Children are usually off limits in these kinds of books. I'm glad I didn't order the next book at the same time I ordered this one or I'd feel compelled to read it.

ACK! I do love the silly world Anita Blake inhabits, where vampires have legal rights and zombie-raising is an acceptable occupation. Will vampires get the vote? Will Anita survive to see the answer? Stay tuned, kids, same bat time, same bat channel! (I loved tv's Batman, too!) This book was so gory, which I mention because it is like the elephant in the room that isn't really talked about by the characters.
