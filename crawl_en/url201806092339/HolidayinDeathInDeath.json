And, this book is celebrating it with a serial killer who decorates his victims with the Twelve Days of Christmas theme. It makes my holiday rituals seem a little boring. The only thing dying during our holiday gatherings is the idea that seeing those long-lost family members again is a good idea. I mean, really, we don't see them all year for a reason...I'm still pissed off at them over that one. I do NOT have a chocolate problem! We get along just fine.And, what else does the Christmas Spirit bring to people? That's right, simmering rage and violent eruptions of emotional pain. Eve gets really into the Christmas spirit in this book. She is in a mood so bitchy that even those homeless guys who scream at cars on the street are telling her to calm down a notch. She is absolutely horrible to everyone. But, I guess nobody can complain that she showed favoritism in her gift-giving. She gave them equal shares of insults, yelling, and cursing.So, again, I need to ask the question that I ask every book: why the hell does Roarke like Eve? There isn't a pleasant bone in her body. Her favorite thing to say to him is \"kiss my ass\". She treats Peabody like an abusive parent treats their kid when they're drunk. She even storms into a police officer's Christmas party on Christmas Eve and freaks out that he isn't working.\n\"Where the hell are my reports? Where are my results? What the fuck's going on around here?\"\"Hey, it's Christmas Eve. Lighten up.\"Her hand snapped out, grabbed him by the shirtfront, and yanked him off the table. \"I've got four bodies and a woman in the hospital. don't you fucking tell me to lighten up, you little cross-eyed son of a bitch. I want my test results.\"\nWait a minute. This sounds familiar. Aunt Eve? Is that you? Stupid family holidays...Seriously, though, someone get this woman a Xanax.

The dialogue between Peabody and Eve made me laugh and it made me cry. Ditto that between Roarke and Eve. I loved every single word in this book and enjoyed every precious moment! Each book in this series builds upon the character of Eve and it is very hard not to love her as much as the author obviously does. In this book she is coming to grips with the Christmas holiday and having to buy gifts for her ever increasing circle of friends. It is both funny and sad to see her as she struggles with something which is second nature to those of us who have had normal family relationships for the whole of our lives. Roarke and Eve both have to start laying down their own customs and traditions as they both led deprived childhoods.This is another brilliant episode in this amazing series.

This guy was a really nasty piece of work, and the fact that it muddled Eve's mind due to how personal it was for her was not a new idea. However, it still stirs up a lot of pity from the reader...namely ME. I hope that Eve seriously addresses her issues soon. I love this series but something I just thought about while listening to this installment is how Eve is the one with all the problems. Girl is messed up. And I suppose entering into a relationship with Roarke and allowing all of these new friendships into her life are a big step in the right direction for her. Still, I would like to see some healing start to take shape.There's something going on between Peabody and McNab, and I'm loving that angle of the story. I have a feeling their romance will play out slowly, so it will be great fun to watch that unfold. The series seems to get a little sexier in this book. Roarke is awfully randy for his wife, and I'm okay with that :D Another great listen! Love the narrator. The story was, of course, very good. I just read awhile back about how this author has no plans to give Eve and Roarke a child...like, EVER. And I'm really bummed out about that. I think it would add an element to their relationship (and the series) that it needs. Give it some levity in a different direction than the same ole badass cop, hot husband thing. I'd love to see Eve as a mother. But woe is me...never gonna happen.

Eve and Peabody with help from McNabb and Rourke work at a frantic pace to catch the killer before he can strike again. The case was exciting and I was hooked from the start. My favorite part though was the dynamics between all the characters. Eve, Peabody, McNabb and Rourke all worked together and Eve wasn't her usual antagonistic self. She was much more likeable in this book. It was comical when she slipped in Christmas shopping as she was investigating the case. This is Eve and Rourke's first Christmas and it was touching how sentimental Rourke was in his attempts to make holiday memories.

Roarke says he will put the lights on after they decorate the tree - who does that? Lights go on first, then the other decorations.

Every single character in this book world has a piece of my heart. Even Summerset. He may not like Eve *not in a way he can admit* but he respects her and looks after her in his own way. That's a relationship I look forward to seeing how it develops over time, with all the fireworks entailed, heh. This was a tough one to read in some ways. These murders broke Eve's heart and she broke mine because it really did a number on her. The plot was interesting, the action kept things moving and in places had me on the edge of my seat. That Nora Roberts can do this with every book *and has for 40+ books, apparently* continues to blow my mind. The banter and dialogue is always amazing and funny as hell at times.

I\u2019ve become comfortable with Eve\u2019s routine of chasing after serial killers. That was expected, many will say, since that is at the heart of it all. I agree, but it starts to lack the thrill. Yes, it\u2019s their first Christmas together, but also in Eve and Roarke\u2019s relationship there is not much more to expect, at least for now. She works too much, he worries and cares for her; he helps her in the case being investigated; and so on. Not that I didn\u2019t like them here. Despite it all, I loved Roarke and Eve, that is a given for me so far. There was a good mystery, we meet a sociopath dressed as Santa, ringing in bells to sexually attack and murder his victims.This case was not easy on Eve, as it could be expected it brings back hidden memories of a little girl with a monster for a father. So we get a cranky and bitchy Eve sometimes, especially with Peabody and Nadine. She was never an easy character, but I like her nonetheless.Despite its predictability, I still enjoyed Holiday.

This time our favorite cop, Eve Dallas, must find a series killer who rapes and murder women and men in Christmas time. I am glad to see that after seven books this series the author continues to give us books with a quality. We still have a lot to learn for our favorite characters and for the futuristic world-building.I was sure that Eve would have a problem with this time of year. I was so right! As a woman with no good memories as a child, her reaction was expected. She is not used to have family and friends and now she has to buy presents for the people she cares about and have a party with her husband! Yes, that makes her uncomfortable. Sometimes she is abrupt and tactless she\u2019s saying things in a wrong way. It\u2019s good that she understands that she\u2019s not right and she apologizes in her own way. In this book, because the case involves rapes, she takes it personal and she pushes herself too much. Some people will call her cold but I don\u2019t think it\u2019s true. I simply believe that she is afraid to feel. Rightly, if you want my opinion, because the one person that should have been there and take care of her, her father, was a monster who raped her when she was just a little girl. Roarke\u2026. Best husband ever! Really, he\u2019s there for her every step of the way. Sometimes it\u2019s weird to see him put his own life behind so he can help Eve but his love for her and his need to protect her from herself is obvious. He\u2019s still a mystery. Yes, we learn some things for his past but not everything and I am very curious about him. His need to belong and to have a family and make memories it\u2019s obvious and sometimes I think that he knows Even better than she knows herself!Peabody is another character that I really like in this series and although she and Eve have some problems in this story, they care for each other a lot. It\u2019s easy to see that Peabody feels lonely and that she has not the same mind with Eve and that means that Eve wants to protect her when there is no actual need for protection. Nevertheless, they respect each other and they always find a way to work things out. Also, I like this love/hate relationship between Peabody and McNab. I truly believe that they should give it a try and start a relationship! It would be hilarious! So, this was another great story with very well-written plot that I enjoyed too much!

It has been the hardest case for me so far. Not only was there a serial killer on the loose, but he was sexually attacking his victims. This was rough on Eve. It brought all those memories from being a young girl and having a monster of a father (I can barely type that last word). This case really wore down on Eve and I think it also was rough on Roarke. This is the first time, and last I suspect, that I saw him worn out and wanting more sleep. I loved seeing the lengths Roarke took to take care of Eve, even if it wasn't what she wanted. She definitely needed it and he knew that. She can\u2019t rest until she gets her man, but the toll it takes on her is steep. This installment of the In Death series just reaffirmed that Eve is not just standing for justice, but she\u2019s fighting for the innocent victims.I am still amazed at how much Robb (Roberts) is able to fit into her books. The case, romance, the development and growth of relationships (romantic and friendly), the futuristic aspects of the world she has created, humor, heartfelt moments, backstories, and everything else in between. She did not disappoint in Holiday. Eve\u2019s relationships were strengthened and tested in this one. There were times I felt for her, laughed with her and felt that she was a tad bit out of line. But she\u2019s new to the whole \u201cfamily/friends\u201d thing, so it\u2019ll take her time to figure it all out.
