A master of creating a story between the lines by what he leaves out. his pointed dialogue doesn't describe; it guides the reader to fill in the blanks. I was particularly engrossed by the stories of homosexuality and how explicit they were. the language surprised me but then I've never been 'in situ' with a group of gay men. Like I say; he's been there and knows what he's writing about. one of my favourite authors.."}, {"userName": "Teya Z", "userReviewDate": "Mar 21, 2017", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/65520661-teya-z", "userReview": "What a delightful day read.

I guessed the outcome of The Madonna of the Cherry Trees, but was surprised by the ending of Abracadaver. I highly recommend Infidelity. Quotations from the back cover -\"Dust is everywhere, but what is it? Is it the dust of death, blowing across a Mediterranean island and etched by the footprints of a small boy? Is it the fine but offending particles on the wings of angels and archangels so carefully brushed away by the Vergerine sisters in the nave of the cathedral? Or is it the smoke languidly rising from that one illicit cigarette?\"\"In Dust to Dust, Timothy Findley weaves the consciousness of mortality with the everyday acts of living and loving, of desire and faith. The result is a wonderful collection of stories which swings with a smooth arc between joy and bitterness, satire and candor, comedy and tragedy.\"My favourite is Infidelity with the setting in France because it had suspense, humour and reality woven together. \"I waited-barely able to deal with the suspense. Thank God for the cigarette. I was almost sick with apprehension. How had this happened? All I had done was overhear a short conversation-and I was already so embroiled in these people's lives I might just as well have been writing them.\"As this is my first exposure to this author, I will endeavour to locate and read The Piano Man's Daughter, which was a #1 national best seller and also You Went Away, a novella authored by Timothy Findley. Thanks to my friends Elizabeth who gave me this book and Sandy who recommended the author, Timothy Findley.2.5\u2b50\ufe0f"}, {"userName": "Kris - My Novelesque Life", "userReviewDate": "Nov 18, 2011", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/6275022-kris---my-novelesque-life", "userReview": "3.5 STARS\"Is it the dust of death, blowing across a Mediterranean island, and etched by the footprints of a small boy who seems to be a disturbing emblem of his parents' unhappy marriage?

In Dust to Dust, Timothy Findley is a master of mortality and the powerful, yet often imperceptible bond it forges with memory and reality.In this brilliant new collection of short stories - his first since the highly acclaimed Stones - Timothy Findley weaves his storytelling spell around a thematically linked collection of stories that move. literally, from dust to dust.

And the unforgettable Rosedale couple from Findleys \"Minna and Bragg\" stories, who reappear in two more haunting tales.
