Fact: I know shamefully extremely little on Camelot and everything related to King Arthur so, when I picked this book up, I expected it to enlighten me on the subject, even if only a little\u2026And ishe did. Of course, this is a retelling, and a modern one let\u2019s not forget so, surely, some things were modified or adapted but, overall, I got a good idea of King (Prince - because this is set before he became a king) Arthur\u2019s destiny, of the Camelot court and the magic related to the world.I thought about it, and I will not summarize the plot as I normally do in this review, for the author (or whoever wrote the original) did so exceptionally well. No misinterpretation. But, basically, the main character, Morgan, enters a competition to become Prince Arthur\u2019s Marvel and so serve him and protect him with her fire power\u2026But the competition turns out more lethal than she thought it would be.When I say that this was a surprising read, I mean it with all my heart. At the beginning, I wasn\u2019t impressed because it honestly was too rushed and perfect, as in the main character makes everyone gawp with her special fire power. That was predictable since, after all, she is the main character. But, when she entered the school, the plot got kickass and mysterious and far better than it started. Throughout the story, the author planted twists, turns, betrayals and secrets at every corner. The story was overall fantastic, and I especially liked how I thought that I was unfolding Henge pretty well but then realized that I was completely wrong about everything or so.I knew that this was going to be urban fantasy (set in the contemporary world) and we never get to forget it, since the characters use technology often enough, but I think this would have been better off all of those tablets and cell phones\u2026Because it broke the intensity of \u2018\u2018Camelot\u2019\u2019 whenever a texting was mentioned, etc. I tried to play along but I still think that an historical context or the equivalent would have worked better and especially bring out the world-building much more in importance!Other things that worked so-so for me were the simplistic dialogs. I mean, there was no complexity there. The complexity in detail and prettiness went to the descriptions but, somehow, didn\u2019t reach the dialogs. Sometimes the characters even sounded childish because of that. The familiar style might have been at fault. Again\u2026if only there was at least the illusion of an historical setting.I hope many will give this a chance, because there was so much to be enjoyed inside it."}, {"userName": "Paula M. of Her Book Thoughts!", "userReviewDate": "Sep 04, 2014", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/23287093-paula-m-of-her-book-thoughts", "userReview": "You can also read my review HERE.\n\"This is my favorite feeling in the world. Hot energy spawns in my heart like the sun and travels through my arms. My veins burn. My body becomes like the earth, sizzling with flowing lava..\"\n\n I have found The Book. The book that makes me feel that Harry Potter, Vampire Academy (not because of the vampires) and The Hunger Games feels~ \n Nope. I'm not exaggerating or anything like that. I dare you to read this book and NOT be so invested like I did.. I swear, you will fail. Despite of the all those feels that I mentioned, Henge is original and totally stand on it's own. This book needs more audience because it's truly deserving. Realm Lovejoy is a very talented and brilliant author. Henge is modern retelling of Camelot that focus on Morgan Le Fay. If you're like me and you just heard that for the very first time, I suggest you Google it like I did because the story is really rich and intriguing. Much like this retelling that Realm Lovejoy crafted. The main protagonist is, of course, Morgan. She's a Fire user. And something happened when she was still a child that gave her determination and courage to be a Maven (Its like a Kings adviser) But she's not the only one who wants that position. Unfortunately, she's one of the many magic users that wants that position and all of them are competing to be the Kings maven.Henge is a fantasy book that doesn't lose thrill in every chapter. Secrets, lies, action, kickass characters, this book has it all. Morgan is a very likeable protagonist. I actually like her more than Katniss. She can be so badass, be a girl (you know, that gets crushes and all that) and still be smart, intuitive and make logical actions. She's my favorite part. Every characters in this book is a gem actually, they're real and even though we are seeing them through Morgan's eyes, it feels like we know them. They're fantastically and wonderfully written. All of them, even the antagonists. I still don't know when will the sequel be out but I AM TELLING YOU, I'M DYING!! ITS TORTURE. I WANT IT NOWWWWW. I've never wanted a sequel so bad (okay since World After, Murder of Crows.. etc) Anyway, HENGE IS THAT GOOD. We always have some problems about first book in a series, this one is too much awesome to hate. Its perfection. Henge richly written with beautiful characters that will satisfy your YA read need. This book is made for every readers! If you're fan of HP, VA, or THG.. I absolutely suggest you read Henge!PS.\u00a0I ship Morgan with Lancelot. Pls author, MAKE IT HAPPEN. I KNOW THERE'S SOMETHING THERE. I. JUST. KNOW. IT."}, {"userName": "Monica", "userReviewDate": "Nov 18, 2014", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/24364577-monica", "userReview": "This review was originally posted on Avid Reviews: www.avidfantasyreviews.comI have been a huge fan of Arthurian legend for as long as I can remember. I started out with T.A. Barron\u2019s novels on Merlin and then in middle school graduated to Mary Stewart\u2019s novels on Camelot. In high school I first read Marion Zimmer Bradley\u2019s Mists of Avalon, an Arthurian legend told from the perspective of all female characters, and since then I have taken a class in college that had a unit on the subject, and have read and re-read any Arthurian novel that I could possibly get my hands on. You can probably understand why I was both excited and apprehensive when I found out about Henge, which is a re-telling of the legend in a modern day setting. Would the story transfer well to a modern setting, or would the book end up as a weak attempt to duplicate Harry Potter with mythical characters? Thankfully I really enjoyed Lovejoy\u2019s unique take on my favorite tale, and I was impressed with her storytelling ability, world building, and her capacity to make my favorite legend come alive and capture my imagination all over again. Henge is a novel that will be perfect both for readers that are familiar with Arthurian legend and those that are new to the subject, and will delight anyone that is looking for a new series to become invested in. This novel has all the components that make a novel thrilling as well as engrossing. The plot is fast paced and full of twists and turns, and there are mysterious magical \u201caccidents\u201d that seem to follow Morgan le Fey and that manage to imbue the story with plenty of mystery. In addition, the competition between the candidates in Arthur\u2019s Round makes the relationships between the characters complex and compelling. Throughout much of the novel Morgan seems to have all of Camelot against her, and every day becomes a challenge to survive the politics and rivalry that permeates every aspect of life in Camelot. Lovejoy did a wonderful job of reviving the story of Arthur Pendragon and company with new life, and I love that she augmented the story by including characters found in legends from the same Medieval time period, like that of Tristan and Isolde. It could not have been easy to adapt this ancient story to fit so well in a modern setting, but Lovejoy makes this transition seem effortless.The magic in Henge is based off simple concepts (that of the elements- water, wind, fire, ext.), but the execution of the magic is intricate and unique. I was also impressed with Lovejoy\u2019s focus on how magic affects the society and politics of Morgan\u2019s world. These types of world building details are what really makes a story come alive for the reader. Also, the interactions between Morgan and the secondary characters are seem natural and are full of plenty of nuance. One of my literary pet-peeves is when conversations and relationships between characters feel forced or unnatural, and I am glad the characters in this novel avoid this pitfall, and instead feel like real people with complicated morals and desires. There is one aspect of this novel that troubled me, but it resolved itself slowly throughout the story. My issue was with the pacing, and by this I do not mean the profusion of exciting and engaging scenes, which this novel happens to have in abundance. Instead, I felt that some scenes in the beginning of the novel were unnecessarily short, and Morgan seemed to dance from setting to setting before I could fully absorb what had happened. This issue is definitely one of taste, as I tend to like my novels to go in-depth with descriptions and details, but either way, I became more engrossed in each setting as the story went on, and it did not detract from my enjoyment of the novel overall. This is a novel that I would recommend to both YA and adult readers that love fantasy and re-tellings of myths. The Le Fay series is sure to delight readers who are searching for a new series to capture the imagination, and a story that is good enough to loose yourself in.My Rating: 7.5/10I received a copy of this novel for review from CBB Book Promotions and the author in return for an honest review, and I want to thank them for the opportunity to read such a fun and engaging story!"}, {"userName": "Kimber Wheaton", "userReviewDate": "Dec 25, 2014", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/16667146-kimber-wheaton", "userReview": "I received this book from the author in exchange for an honest review.First things first: if you are a fan of Arthurian legend then this is definitely the book for you. Henge is a modern urban fantasy featuring many of the Arthurian characters in an interesting, high-stakes story.Morgan is a very passionate character. Somehow Ms. Lovejoy managed to draw me to Morgan's corner practically from page one. When we first meet Morgan, she is sneaking away from home to follow her dreams, which her father doesn't agree with-- for very good reason, we learn as the story progresses. We also meet Merlin early on, and I found his character rather fascinating. In fact, I enjoyed reading Ms. Lovejoy's take on all of the classic characters.The suspense in this novel builds from chapter to chapter, with new twists and turns to keep the pages turning. In some ways it reminded me of the Harry Potter books, especially at the beginning when Morgan was leaving for the magic academy. Bad guy Mordred was well-written... my skin crawled whenever he appeared. I seriously couldn't stand him. Since this is book one of a series, don't expect closure at the end. I have a feeling you'll be craving book two once you've finished reading.Fantastical, fast-paced, full of magic and suspense-- Henge will appeal to readers from teens to adults, especially those with a soft spot for King Arthur."}, {"userName": "Rhea Dsouza", "userReviewDate": "Dec 05, 2014", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/19034087-rhea-dsouza", "userReview": "Many of us have grown up reading about the legend of King Arthur and the Knights of the Round Table. And the Camelot legends. And the forgery of the Excalibur at the Isle of Avalon. But with Henge, a modern day retelling of the legends, Realm Lovejoy has taken this to a whole new level.Reading Henge gave me a new insight on some characters I\u2019d never even thought of for so many years. Particularly, Morgan le Fay and Sir Lancelot. We\u2019ve all heard of these characters, of course, (if you haven\u2019t you need to, like yesterday!) but thanks to the author\u2019s modern outlook and a complete new set of personalities for each character, it was so, so good to read them from a fresh perspective.For starters, Morgan le Fay (daughter of Morgause and her lover Sir Gorlois) has been kept sheltered all her life. Being a fire user and witnessing her mother\u2019s capture and downfall through fire has made her father wary of allowing magic to be used. But when sign ups for the Arthur\u2019s Round open, Morgan knows what she has to do: she has to become the Maven\u2014King Arthur\u2019s right hand and the one to lead him to Avalon.Therein begins Morgan\u2019s journey in the magical school that will train and guide her, while also simultaneously trying to break her and kill her. While in school, she meets many other characters that we\u2019ve read in the legends\u2014Gawain, Guinevere, Maleagant, Tristan and of course the wizard Merlin.I think the most interesting part, at least for me, was reading about all these characters and how they were in their youth, especially knowing how they will be. It was all kinds of awesome.The magic in the Camelot world is simple and elemental\u2014while also interesting and really well used among the characters. Each one had a unique attribute to them and I liked reading the diversity of these powers among each competitor. Obviously, Henge is the first part of the Le Fay series and so it\u2019s a bit early to take sides and ship ships but the writing was such that you can\u2019t help but take these sides. And ship the non-canon ships.My only major complain with the book was that I expected much, much more from Mordred. He\u2019s an important character to both the legend and to Morgan le Fay but I hardly saw him or heard from him in the book. I\u2019d really like to see him more because he\u2019s the supposed bad guy so he needs to do some bad stuff. Another issue was the pacing of the book. Up until 70% there wasn\u2019t anything interesting happening; just fires and floods all aiming to kill Morgan. It was interesting, no doubt, but it kind of dragged on and I was waiting for some action and reaction.There\u2019s a lot of plotting and planning going on with the most unexpected people so that was a pleasure to read. All in all, the world that Henge is based on is one of my favorites and Realm Lovejoy did it complete justice. Looking forward to more Lancelot, Mordred, Merlin and of course King Arthur himself :D\n*I was provided a free ecopy of this book in exchange of an honest review.

Morgan's mother, Morgause, was executed a decade before for the murder of her husband--while in self-defense--but no one would hear Morgan's testimony. It seems that Morgan's father wasn't Morgause's husband, and Morgause took great pains to keep Morgan's identity secret.Still, Morgan has a lot of anguish over losing her mother, and she's unhappy about the restrictions placed on all magic users in the realm. She wants to be the Maven, or head magic user charged with protection of the next king, Arthur. As Maven, Morgan would use her power to help magic users have a better life.Morgan auditions for a spot in Arthur's Round, the selection cycle for Arthur's Maven, and comes up against some talented magic users. Morgan and Guinivere, who has healing energy, become friends, but Morgan suspects something about water-user Merlin that isn't straight up. There are others, and the plot thickens when Morgan learns her mother was a member of the Luminary--a rogue group of magic users who attempted to kill King Uther, Arthur's father, fifteen years before. This attack resulted in the sweeping crackdown on magic use under which Morgan now exists.There are some definitely dangerous goings on, with Morgan sometimes smack in the middle of what appears a plot to incapacitate, or even kill, her. It also becomes clear that powers are working behind the scenes to promote Merlin ahead of Morgan--when Merlin doesn't even want to be Maven. Morgan struggles to figure out whom is responsible, and keeps coming up just short, but her determination and craft catapult her into the neck-and-neck race for Maven.There's significant mystery here. Morgan isn't a dishrag; she fights hard for all she believes, risking her very life to save others. The tension is real, though I sometimes felt the story jumped too fast. The end is a fierce resolution with plenty more story to tell...in the next book.I definitely would read on in this series. A great start with believable drama and well-crafted characters. Innocent, excepting, well, the grisly deaths of a couple baddies.

But not a Harry Potter rip-off. That is key. I loved the magical school atmosphere and I loved that it was mixed in with the stories of king Arthur and Camelot. Henge is the start of what I am sure is going to be a very loved series. There is something for every fantasy and magic lover. Awesome magic, a fantastic plot line that is detailed and twisty as they come, and a dark and suspenseful characters and storyline that will have you guessing who the bad guy is and just what exactly is going on until the last page. I loved Henge. I am not ini love with the cover, but don't let that distract you from the gem of a story found within its' pages.Morgan is one of my favorite female main characters that I have had the pleasure of meeting in a while. She is so perceptive. I loved how shrewd, but still kind she was. She knew when to be distrustful of people, even when she didn't want to be. You could tell that she longed for some real friends, but because of events in her life she has always been kind of isolated. She is so powerful, but I can't wait to learn more about her powers. Specifically, how her powers interact with her emotions. They seem to feed off of the more negative emotions and I want to learn why that is.Merlin, Gwen and the whole secondary cast also captured my attention. I was bummed when one of them deceived me, but I soon learned to follow Morgan's instincts. She was almost always dead on, even when she didn't know why or didn't want to be. She got it wrong a few times, but overall she was so impressive in her ability to read people and pick up on subtle clues.The elemental magic in Henge was great. I loved watching the water and fire users. I am still unsure of just what my feelings are on magic and camelot and Mordred but I look forward to finding out more about all three in the next book. The setup is all there for this to be an amazing series, and Henge was an epic first installment. If you liked Harry Potter and want another magical story that is not just a cheap imitation, but rather has a life of its' own, you need to check out Henge!\u00a0This review was originally posted on Book Briefs"}, {"userName": "Deborah", "userReviewDate": "Nov 17, 2014", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/16900794-deborah", "userReview": "Henge is one of the most original YA novels I\u2019ve read in a long time \u2013 an updated take on the Arthurian legend in a skewed modern setting. All the usual suspects are there: alongside the viewpoint character, Morgan Le Fay, we find Merlin, Guinevere, Lancelot, Mordred, Vivian, Uther, etc., etc. But in this reality, Knights carry guns, students have cars and mobile phones, Camelot rules the UK and magic is strictly licensed.Morgan\u2019s mother, Morgause, was executed for illegal use of magic, but before this happened, she took Morgan to the Henge where the child had a vision that confirmed she would be Arthur\u2019s Maven. So, despite her father\u2019s attempts to keep her away from Camelot, Morgan pursues her goal by joining Arthur\u2019s Round, the elite set of student magic-users from whom Arthur\u2019s closest advisor will be chosen.Before I say more, I\u2019m going to start at the end which, for me, prompted an explosion of annoyance. Whilst the main story arc \u2013 that of Morgan striving to become Maven \u2013 was wrapped up, this book is in no way a stand alone, and for me, I consider cliff-hanger endings to be a total cheat. Having said that, this story is so original and compelling that I definitely want to find out what happens, so I am reluctantly forced to admit, job well done by the author.My other bugbear \u2013 I really find the use of present tense a turn off, but this one was so well done I was willing to go a long with it.The writing was really excellent: great dialogue, description, action, pacing, incredible twists and turns that keep you guessing and questioning right along with Morgan. The world building is unique and believable, and whilst most of the story takes place in a familiar school-like setting, this is in no way a Harry Potter rip off. I do feel that the cover suggests this book is aimed at a younger audience than it is \u2013 I would say with the traumatic scenes, the politics and some rather more adult themes, this is definitely YA, not middle grade as the cover tends to imply.Probably the strongest part of the novel, aside from the imaginative setting, is Morgan herself. She is a masterful creation, with intense drive, a fantastic depth of character, and filled with ultimately believable conflicting emotions resulting from her troubled history.So at the end, I\u2019d highly recommend this book to anyone who doesn\u2019t care that they will need to buy the next book to find out what happens.

It\u2019s one of my favorite books I\u2019ve read all year, if not the absolute favorite. While the writing wasn\u2019t spectacular (the writing was all right but not amazing), the characters were fantastic and the world building blew me away. In terms of world building, this book ranks right up there with Harry Potter.It\u2019s actually similar in some ways (and totally differnet in others). Our protagonist, Morgan, is a fire user who has the ability to command fire at will. Her dad is opposed against magic because of what happened to her mother, but either way Morgan decides to participate in a contest to get selected in Arthur\u2019s Round, a group of elite young magic user. One of them will be chosen as Maven \u2013 and it\u2019s always been Morgan\u2019s dream to become the Maven. Even more so, she once had a vision about it.Morgan wins second prize after a boy named Merlin, but because she has no official magic license, she isn\u2019t allowed to participate in Arthur\u2019s Round. However, for some reason she\u2019s allowed in anyway and despite her Dad\u2019s protests, she goes. Along with other magic users \u2013 fire, water and wind, and a healer, Guinevere who she becomes friends with, Morgan trains to become the most powerful magician she can be in order to become the next Maven. But the past has a way of catching up with her, and although powerful, the boy who beat her at the contest, Merlin, is very powerful as well. Is he a friend or a foe? When her life becomes endangered, Morgan will have to figure out who she can trust.I\u2019ve been in love with the Camelot legend for decades (well, a decade at least) so to see it in a contemporary, original context makes my heart race. And all the familiar characters drop by yet they\u2019re totally original at the same time. Morgan is an easy to like protagonist. She\u2019s been shaped by her past, always watching her back, always weary. At the same time she\u2019s independent, intuitive, strong and this definitely isn\u2019t a girl who needs a boy to make her feel special. She\u2019s quite capable of holding her own.I\u2019m dying to read the sequel to this book.

I\u2019m always a little skeptic when I read stuff like that. Those books are my favorites and there are not many books that can really get to that level. At least that\u2019s my opinion. But \u2018Henge\u2019 completely blew my mind from the moment I started reading it. The world of Camelot is truly amazing. There is magic, there are knights and there are royalties. I loved how Realm Lovejoy used names as Camelot, Knight and of course Lancelot. And somehow those names completely fitted this new world of magic.\u2018Henge\u2019 is a grabbing story about a girl with a purpose. Morgan is determined to revenge her mother by becoming the next Maven. But the journey to become Maven isn\u2019t an easy one. It seems everyone is against Morgan. Even though Morgan grew up alone, was home schooled, and hasn\u2019t been allowed outside of her home much, Morgan really wants to find friends. But even people who are being friendly against Morgan have their own secrets. This story was really intense and exciting and Realm Lovejoy makes sure you never want to stop reading.I loved Morgan\u2019s character. I loved how passionate and determined she was and the way she just didn\u2019t let herself be distracted. At times I felt sad for her because she worked so hard and nobody really seemed to notice that. If everyone just was honest with Morgan, she would have had on honest chance to prove herself.I really loved this book. I really just didn\u2019t want to stop reading. I loved this world of Camelot, the magic and the mystery. This book is definitely going on my favorite list and I completely understand the comparison to Hogwarts and Panem. Hogwarts is still on first place for me, but Panem and Henge are definitely on the same line.This book is definitely a must read for every fantasy, magic and Arthurian legend lover out there.

It\u2019s more of an urban-fantasy, giving the tale a twist and bringing Camelot and magic to modern day Britain. Morgan is a fire user, and with it she\u2019s hot tempered and strong willed. Throughout the book she struggles with being herself and with being who she thinks other people want her to be: her father, her friends, the royals, and her instructors in the Round. Merlin is a water user; calm and quick witted and everyone seems to like him without him ever seeming to try. Morgan can\u2019t help but admire him for his talent with magic, but something keeps her from trusting Merlin.The story is well-written with references to both an ancient Camelot (history class, ugh) and modern-day Britain. The magic is based more on elements then wizardry that\u2019s seen in the usual Arthurian legends, but it allows each character to show unique skill sets. It brings familiar characters into interesting new roles (who wouldn\u2019t want a flirty Lancelot as an instructor?!) and it leaves the reader guessing who\u2019s going to be the antagonist of the story and who\u2019s the true protagonist.

An urban fantasy set in modern day times, Henge is a unique twist on an old favorite that sees readers drawn into this intriguing world of magic and mayhem as Lovejoy sets up a great start to a promising new series.  Henge follows sixteen year old Morgan Le Fay, a talented fire user whose magic is more powerful than that of anyone else she knows and who has plans to become the Maven; the individual tasked with leading Prince Arthur to Excalibur, if only she can be drafted to Camelot and win Prince Arthurs favor. Wanting a chance to change the laws of Camelot after losing her mother at a young age, Morgan is invited to participate in the Rounds, an elite competition and series of tests tasked with examining her magic and other talented magic users her age in order to determine who is worthy of different rolls, including that of the Maven, within Camelot.

Set in modern times, Henge is an intriguing, yet extremely magical twist on everything that is Camelot, Excalibur, King Arthur, Merlin and the Knights of the Round Table\u2026..basically everything Arthurian.  Our heroine in Henge is Morgan Le Fay, and in an ingenuous twist on the story, Morgan is an honorable, kickass heroine who has big plans for her future. She wants to serve Camelot and protect Prince Arthur and is willing to do anything she can to get into this position. Morgan comes from a family of powerful magic users, most notably her mother, a powerful woman who was executed for magic fueled crimes. Morgan is understandably angry over her mother\u2019s death and it\u2019s her desire to bring about change that fuels her hopes for her future. As a participant in the Rounds, Morgan has the opportunity to meet other talented magic users and see just what is out there magic wise\u2014something that makes her appreciate what she can do all the more.  Lovejoy explores the different Arthurian characters wonderfully in Henge with many of the minor characters famous in their own rights. There\u2019s a lot of mystery surrounding who is the good guy and who is the bad guy in this novel as Merlin, Mordred and even Lancelot seem to have their own agendas; none of which are brought to light in this novel, although it doesn\u2019t stop you as the reader from speculating just what they have in store or what they are privy to.  Setting up a promising new world and ending on a small cliffhanger that will have you wanting to read the next book straight away nonetheless, Henge is a whimsical take of Arthurian legend and will entice you from the very beginning. Be prepared to want more as Realm Lovejoy plays with a fan favorite and gives it a fresh new vibe!"}, {"userName": "Ashley Jellison", "userReviewDate": "Nov 25, 2014", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/22341346-ashley-jellison", "userReview": "Originally posted at The Word at My FingertipsOh. My. Gosh. Eeep! This book was so freakin' fantastic and I LOVED it!First off, I love anything Arthurian-legend. I also have an obsession with the show Merlin, which was a huge problem reading this because I tried to put the characters to the actors and fit them to personalities and yeah. That didn't work. But I've also read Howard Pyle's original story of Arthur and I liked it a lot. So this was a story I couldn't pass up, as you can probably tell from how many times it's been on the blog so far.I think one of my very favorite things about Henge is that we are in Morgan's point of view. She tells the story (by the way, she's a wonderful story-teller). I like how it works out, because the whole time, I could only think about how Morgana ends up being Arthur's doom. And I just couldn't see that through Morgan. Until the story progressed. And I LOVE how Realm shows Morgan's struggles to remain kind and friendly when her dreams are being ripped away. I love how we go through and see reasons why Morgan changed. And I like seeing her before. The ending almost killed me because of what it did to her. But I still loved it.Merlin. Oh, Merlin. Merlin, Merlin, Merlin, Merlin. If I type his name more, maybe he'll show up. Because I'd like that. Merlin. Okay, fine, it won't work. But Merlin is seriously awesome. For one, he's portrayed as the perfect teenager who literally is just perfection. But as we get to know him, we realize he is not completely perfect. He has flaws. But he is also pretty confident, so usually we don't see the flaws. He starts to care for Morgan, which I totally ship, but then he does stuff she hates but it's for her own good and yeah, they have a friendship-fall-out. Sadness. But Merlin is simply amazing and I want him as a friend.I'm just so happy with the twist on such a classic. This is modern-day, and the world knows about Camelot, which is just sitting in the middle of the U.K. To get into Camelot, teenagers audition using their magic and are judged. The top users are drafted in. Of course Morgan makes it, and then we get to see how Camelot is. It's definitely more modern, but I can just picture it in my head. Morgan is shooting for the spot of Arthur's right-hand man, the Maven. Camelot picks the top student for the job. Arthur is also only thirteen, so a very impressionable teenager. I like that twist. It's cute, but it gives the story a lot of room to develop him.Whoa I did not see the antagonist coming. No spoilers, but whoa. Huge surprise. That went crazy. I can't say any more without giving it away.The only problem I had was the very beginning was rushed. The first few chapters, especially when Morgan was at home. I wanted to get more of a feel for the story before plunging headfirst into it. There was a part with her father that was so fast, and I wanted to feel out the relationship more. Because that particular scene would not have been over so quickly.I definitely recommend this to anyone and everyone and I need the sequel right now. ASAP. It's not in my hands yet. This could be a problem.I was going to give this a 4.5 because of the slight rushing, but as I wrote this, I realized I can't do anything under 5. The rushing wasn't distracting to me and I thoroughly enjoyed the story as it was. I have to go find myself a paperback. I cannot live with only an ebook.5 stars"}, {"userName": "Anna (Curiosity comes before Kay)", "userReviewDate": "Jan 12, 2015", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/4846819-anna-curiosity-comes-before-kay", "userReview": "Really enjoyed it. Full review to come when it's my turn on the blog tour in February! :-)\nFULL REVIEW\nIt's hard to find a good Arthurian retelling these days - even harder to find one that's a MODERN retelling of the well-known legends. Realm Lovejoy's Henge, the first in a series about a teenaged Morgan Le Fay, is both of these things. I started reading this book and was immediately drawn in by Morgan who seems like such a good girl, living in an isolated area with her overprotective father Gorlois, who has been told to hide her elemental ability with fire most of her life. At least, she's been hiding her abilities ever since her mother was executed for the murder of her husband using her abilities. But it's Morgan's dream to one day be Maven (basically main advisor) to Arthur once he's on the throne, like her Grandfather was to the Prince's grandfather. So Morgan sneaks away to compete for a place in the trials for Arthur's Round, whom the Maven will ultimately be chosen from. Even competing with a forged license and against her father's wishes, Morgan is chosen to participate in the competition. But does she even have any chance of winning when the man who convicted her Mother, the current Maven, Mordred, seems to be blocking her at every turn? And when some very fishy incidents involving the other candidates (including her friend Guinevere, and rival Merlin) and near death experiences seem to point towards illegal magic usage, Morgan may be fighting for more than just Maven - she might be fighting for her very life...Morgan was such an easily connectable main character. She loves her father and still misses her mother, even after all these years. She just wants a chance to prove that she's not going to make the same mistakes her mother, Morgause, did and to renew her family's legacy. Morgan starts to really come into her own once she's competing in Arthur's Round, really learning to control the fire and do things with it she never imagined. I liked that Lovejoy put Mordred in a position of power, and in opposition of Morgan, especially considering that in the legends he's her son! It was an interesting dynamic, almost verging on complete role reversal. Morgan's the one trying to take over Mordred's position of power, instead of helping him depose Arthur. The take on elemental magic was interesting and the conspiracy involving some of the other candidates, along with the iffy-ness of Merlin's honesty/innoncence in the incidents makes things even more interesting. But probably my favorite things about this book were: Morgan's friendship with Guinevere, who has a healing ability (I have NEVER seen them represented as friends before in ANY retelling!), the twist near the end about what really happened the night Morgan's mother murdered her husband (never saw it coming) and the prophecy/visions Morgan has for her future. Not going to say anymore because I don't want to spoil it, but I really enjoyed this book! Can't wait to read what happens next and I'm really excited for Morgan's further adventures. I highly recommend it!VERDICT: 4/5 Stars*An ebook copy of this book was provided via the author, Realm Lovejoy, and Xpresso Book Tours, in exchange for an honest review.

I love my King Arthur legends and retellings, but I think this was the first I've read that was modernized Arthur. The story doesn't actually revolve around Arthur, though, as it actually follows the story of Morgan Le Fay in her competiton to be Arthur's Maven. I wasn't sure how I felt about the book for the longest time, but then it completely sucked me in at the end. Prince Arthur is thirteen, and it is time to find his Maven. Morgan's father has prohibited her from using her magic, so she sneaks away to enter the preliminary competition. To their surprise, she is chosen as one of the Round, who will go to Camelot to compete to become the Maven, and her father can't stop her. But there are more powers at play than Morgan ever could have imagined. This was an interesting concept of a world, as its a modern-day Camelot. Yes, there's a king, and Knights, but the Knights carry guns, and there's cars and computers and such. Then, add in the magic. There are four kinds of magic users, and Morgan is a fire user. I loved the explanation of magic, as well as the descriptions of them using it as it made it seem real yet, well, magical. It brought a different sort of mystical appeal to the story. Morgan is befriended by the charming and handsome Merlin, a water user. Except something about him doesn't quite add up. Morgan isn't sure who to trust, since it is a competition. I thought this was an interesting representation of Merlin. I also liked the appearance of other characters we know and love, such as the original Knights from mythology. Some have roles, like Lancelot, and others are only mentioned in passing, like Gwaine, but it was nice to see them. But there are a lot more things working than just a magic competition. The reason Mordred has it out for Morgan, what actually happened with her mother all those years ago. While the beginning lagged a little, to the point where I didn't even know if I would continue, once it picked up, it hooked me. I was so entranced by the things that were being revealed, and the things that weren't. There are a lot of little intricacies, and loose ends, and things Morgan discovers that kept this so interesting, that I found myself needing the next book. If you love the legends of King Arthur, or a magical world in general, this is a great story full of plot twists and turns that will keep you interested.

It's a great look at how Merlin ended up as his adviser and as Merlin. A richly developed story and character driven look at Merlin Morgan, Mordred and Arthur. We also get a glimpse of Lancelot and GuinevereHere Morgan and Merlin are in the Arthur Camelot rounds. Both wanting to be Arthur's Maven and lead him to Excalibur and his powers as a Pendragon. Merlin is a water controller and Morgan is fire. Each has a past that shapes who they are and why they are at the rounds. Merlin is more complex and mysterious. Many questions arise around this intriguing character. He is there with a agenda one that doesn't make him happy but as we go on in the story his reasoning changes. He originally is working towards the agenda of his guardian and someone else. Who this is we don't know but several characters are involved and the plot of what this is is revealed in the end. Unfortunately Merlin begins to care for Morgan and wants to protect her. This leads to a friendship and also Morgan losing her trust in Merlin. She is a tough cookie to crack. Being protected by her dad her whole life because of who her mom is, she doesn't really trust easily but when you break it it is hard to get her back on your side. She is powerful and her visions in the henge are incredible. Her future is directly related to Arthur and affects him. Her and Merlin tiptoe around their feelings and each others past until the end when Merlin helps Morgan out once again. Merlin does reveal all he knows at this time and this gets Morgan to begin to warm up to him once again.Throughout the training to see who will be what in Camelot, danger lurks everywhere for Morgan. merlin tries to protect her but this leads to questions and more danger. We see alliances and breaking of some of these alliances. Feelings form and be swept aside when suspicion grows. And we see Morgan begin to question herself and her mother. She begins to feel guilt over what happened to her mother and wonder about her mom's past. She wonders the connection between her mom and mordred and why he hates her so much. The vivid and intricate detail in the book is perfectly balanced. We get the detail when needed and left to wonder and become intrigued when necessary. We get to learn about the characters, their passions, dreams, and left wondering what is driving them. a wonderful character driven plot and story with hidden agendas, plots, pasts that leave questions and feelings left unexplored as we trench into the world of Camelot and King Arthur. A great twist to his tale and can't wait to see what is next for Merlin and Morgan."}, {"userName": "Adriana", "userReviewDate": "Feb 10, 2015", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/4645742-adriana", "userReview": "Folklore has always been fascinating to me. Diving into the world of Camelot, I quickly recognized the names of knights and wizards. Reading about King Arthur when he was a prince, Merlin as a mysterious yet caring figure, and the first real introduction of Morgan Le Fay I've had made the inner nerd in me glow with delight. Following around Morgan and seeing her pain and passion completely had me transfixed. Morgan's relationship with Merlin was always very intriguing and complex. This world that I've read about came to life in a more modern world but where magic users are rarely seen as good. They are seen as dangerous and Morgan wants to change all this by becoming the Maven.Morgan is a fire user and as the story progressed I really got to see how she used her pain to become stronger while she was competing to become Maven. The Maven basically runs the show behind the scenes. The Maven for Prince Arthur is being chosen. Their goal is to lead Arthur to Excalibur. Morgan has had a vision of becoming the Maven so she is determined throughout the competition even when it is clear that she is being targeted by an unknown source. I loved her personality and how her emotions got away from her only because I could see her as a character with depth more clearly. She lost her mother when she was a child. Her mother was executed for killing even if it was self-defense. The Maven of this day, Mordred, killed her. Morgan believes he has made it difficult on magic users to use their magic freely. Many, like her mother, have been killed even for helping others. There is a fog of mystery concerning Mordred and the whole competition. There is something sinister going on but you aren't sure what.There's so many secrets and questions in this story. Merlin is a bit of a mystery. His real emotions are masked often but it seems that he cares for Morgan. I'd like to get to know his character more and what secrets he hides. I was always filled with questions about Morgan and her parents as well as if she herself is going to be contradictory to what she believes in the future. I don't know really much about her but she can be volatile yet you can tell she is a good person. I just don't know where the series will take her and that excites me. I really want to know what happens in this reinvented world and with Morgan. Morgan is such a wonderful character because you can feel her emotions through the pages.

Morgana le Fay is my favorite in Arthurian legends, so I\u2019m always interested in seeing different takes on her character. In Realm Lovejoy\u2019s version of Camelot, cellphones and magic exist side-by-side. The ability to use magic isn\u2019t guaranteed, and even if you can manipulate air, water, or fire, chances are you won\u2019t be anything more than a performer. Unless, that is, you are chosen to become one of the upcoming king\u2019s Rounds. The best Round will be selected as the king\u2019s magic advisor, and the rest will be employed by Camelot as Knights or Relic Keepers. Political acumen is just as important as good magic skills. Morgan\u2019s dream is to become the king\u2019s Maven. She wants magic users to have more rights, not less. And she\u2019ll do anything to pursue that dream, including sneaking out from under her father\u2019s watchful eye, or diving headfirst into the dangers of Camelot. HENGE is quite interesting. I really liked the world the author created, the intriguing mix of magic and modern technology, old legends and new political tangles. There\u2019s a lot of familiar names, including Merlin, Mordred, Guinevere, and Lancelot, but they\u2019re not all straight from the old legends -- they all have their own personalities. I wanted to learn more about each of them, as well as Morgan\u2019s mother, Morgause. Morgan herself was the most interesting character for me, since I was curious to see how the author would develop and grow her. Morgan\u2019s a bit impulsive and tends to jump to conclusions, but she also wants to get rid of the injustices magic users face. I believed her reactions to everything that happened, and the last line of HENGE? I\u2019m not going to spoil it, but yeah.

Magic and technology exist side by side, but not necessarily hand in hand. Magic is confined to six schools of discipline- and only four of those make an appearance in this, the first novel of the series. Magic, once a respected and powerful ability, is now illegal without a license and any who can use it are relegated to second-class citizenry, barely able to earn a living in the entertainment industry doing special effects. But it does make them eligible to serve at Camelot... In fact, those chosen for the royal court are selected via an American Idol-style competition- held after the heir's thirteenth birthday to pick those who'll serve the monarch when he takes the throne. Then they spend what amounts to a year at finishing school where the highest competition is to become the Maven- essentially the king's right hand man. Imagine being selected to become the future king's closest companion and advisor as well as a defender of the realm... and you're barely able to shave, let alone had your first kiss.Arthur, Guinevere, Uther, Igraine, Tristan, Isolde, Lancelot, Mordred- the gang's all here, just in different forms. Morgan's story is not what you've come to know. Her history is troubling, intriguing and intimately entangled with the current state of affairs at court. Morgan's struggles and agnst are palpable- she's a very sympathetic character. You'll absolutely feel for her struggles and want her to succeed. The story gets muddled and convoluted at times; there's several plots afoot and nearly everyone's got something to hide- Merlin especially so. He clearly knows more than he lets on and you're never sure if he's friend or foe. Morgan definitely isn't.Henge is an entertaining and engaging read, despite it's flaws. It's a layered, tightly-knit story filled with small moments that have great impact. My only real complaints are that since it's YA the rush to get them through school and into life at Court diminishes the importance of things. Aside from that, Henge deserves a place on your shelf."}, {"userName": "Ginny  Gallagher", "userReviewDate": "Nov 04, 2014", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/7068334-ginny-gallagher", "userReview": "This review was originally posted on Gin's Book Notes My Review \nHenge\n is book one in Realm Lovejoy's Young Adult Fantasy series \nLe Fey\n.It's one of a few books that I could easily see being made into a popular movie or TV show.

From television shows to films and books, there are a wide variety of stories trying to retell our old classic tales of Arthur and the gang. However, that is not what Realm Lovejoy has done at all. Yes, the legends are the base of the story, but we aren't being told the stories of Camelot we have heard before. Not only are we being told stories of their youth, rather than their renowned adventures, but we are also being told them in a modern day version of Camelot and the world. Personally, I like it. I wasn't certain, once reading the full blurb and the excerpts, but when I got a few pages in, this book had me hooked. it is a fun, fast-paced tale of magic, young love and betrayal. There are everyday adventures and lessons to be learned, all while in the world of magic. We learn about some of our favourite characters, when they were mere teenagers, most of them still growing into their powers and who they would become in later life, as we know them from the tales. Some are cocky, where they are kind and gentle later, others are the epitome of sweet and caring, where we know they will turn to evil and hatred. All these brilliant differences in character make you yearn for the next book in the series, a way to see into the life of each, a way to discover what befalls them, in order to change them so. I thought the characters were fun, exciting and a good representation of the originals, and this helped create a youthful feel to each. I liked the relationships built between each, especially those we have ideas of how they turn out. It's like knowing a secret, but not wanting to tell the characters in your book. I also found the level of reading great. it is exciting, fun and easy to read, making it perfect for YA, but also still a great read for adults, especially with the connection to our legends. This book brings out youth, spunk, excitement and an imaginative world for all who read it. I highly recommend giving it a go, especially if you are fans of Harry Potter, and the likes."}, {"userName": "Pratr- Authors", "userReviewDate": "Jan 02, 2015", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/31408626-pratr--authors", "userReview": "Independent Reviewer for Paranormal Romance and Authors that Rock.

Maybe.The overall feeling I got from this novel was that it sounded very young, middle grader young. I mean, it would fit better in that age bracket than in YA, not that middle graders aren't able to read a story with more substance and complexity. Gosh, I read The Mists of Avalon (the best Arthurian novel there is) when I was thirteen.I liked the premises of Henge, an Arthurian tale embedded in our modern world. Honestly, Henge had all the right elements to be an epic read. But the story never managed to grip me. The dialogues were stiff, the writing uninspiring and very, very minimalist. It felt like I was reading a checklist instead of a novel. It's a shame I couldn't enjoy this novel more. But others might.

I thought this book was written well, though I couldn't get into the main character. She was way too immature for my liking. If you like whiny teenagers, and teenagers constantly questioning themselves, then this book is for you. I have no desire to read the next book."}], "description": "Modern-day Camelot.
