And, once again, Vaughn and Staples create a fantasy world that is so incredibly not fantasy. This volume? This is a real marriage.Can we please fight about it in the morning?Ok, so now that they aren't running for their lives, the mundane existence of taking care of a family sets in...as it does with a lot of marriages.Alana is working full-time as an actress on this space soap opera, and Marko is staying home with Hazel. First comes love, then comes marriage, then comes a baby in the baby carriage...But they don't tell you what happens after that, do they?Yep. You aren't really married till you've practiced your alibi in the mirror, at least once. Now, at some point, you'll both laugh about how you ran into each other at Home Depot, looked into each other's shopping carts, and saw that you were both buying tarp and duct tape.But till then, you'll go through that rough period known as: Those Couple Of Years We Gutted It Out For The Kids.But when you haven't been married long, and the memories of your glory days are still bright and shiny? Well, those first few knock-down drag-out fights can seem like the end of the world.You're also not married till one of you spends the night somewhere else...or at least storms off with the intention of spending the night somewhere else! Most of the time you just *cough* drive around all angry-like, taking out your frustration by singing off-key to break-up music, and giving the finger to incompetent drivers. Eventually, you end up sitting in a parking lot somewhere, as the realization hits that you don't want to spend the night anywhere else. I mean, that's a real hassle when you think about it, right? Wait. Did our song just come on the radio? *sigh* It must be a sign...And so it goes...I think Vaughn did a spectacular job of showing how each of them fell off the sparkly marriage wagon just a bit.Alana starts taking drugs (recreationally) to help her fight the crushing pressure of being the only breadwinner, while working long hours at a soul-sucking job. She misses her family, but if she doesn't make money, they're gonna starve. So, not a lot of choices for her, but to put her head down and keep going.Ahhhhh. That feels much better...That sort of thing usually ends badly, and Alana is no exception to the rule. After a while, it gets easier and easier to just zone out instead of facing her problems. The lines start to blur, and the next thing you know...Meanwhile, Marko becomes the full-time parent. Which, after having done this myself for well over a decade, I think I can speak with some authority when I say, this is the most rewarding job ever.BUT IT CAN SUCK YOUR WILL TO LIVE.First, you don't get paid for it. And the first person who comments, and says that you get Paid in hugs!, wins an ASSHOLE award. I'm not sure how your electric company works, but mine does not accept HUGS as a form of payment. So. NO PAY.Second, Adult Interaction.<---This is very important.And a huge problem arises when you get stuck on playdates with ratchety parents that you don't like. The flavors usually taste like Annoying-Helicopter, Complains-About-Spouse, Kill-It-With-Fire-Religious-Nut, Sports-Dad, My-Child-Can't-Do-Anything-Wrong, Organic-Only-Momma, Let-Me-Tell-You-About-My-Pitiful-Sex-Life, and the absolute worse...The-Clinger.<---The Clinger assumes you are now best buddies forever, and won't stop texting, calling, and thinking up new and exciting reasons to come over and intrude on what little private time you have left.If you don't have a Clinger in your life? Look in the mirror.You know, just to be sure...However, every now and then you meet someone you really like.And, more importantly, your kids like each other!In Marko's case, he's feeling alone and abandoned. He misses his wife, who's gone all the time, and when she is home? Well, she's acting kind of distant and odd. He's also worried about how to keep his daughter safe, but still give her a full life. And now he's got this cute mom, who seems to understand exactly how he feels, practically throwing herself at him.And that's only half the story.The rest includes a Robot father who's become totally unhinged over the death of his child, Gwen & Sophie searching for a way to cure The Will, a Prince on a mission of revenge, a missing baby, and a very unlikely team-up.At first, I thought this one didn't quite measure up to the previous volumes, but the more I considered it, I realized this one was just different. I'm really enjoying watching all of these characters grow and change! I know I'm the eighty-billionth person to say this, but this is a fantastic title!Get this review and more at:"}, {"userName": "karen", "userReviewDate": "Jul 08, 2016", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/45618-karen", "userReview": "[\n\n(hide spoiler)]"}, {"userName": "Elizabeth", "userReviewDate": "Sep 24, 2014", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/21458485-elizabeth", "userReview": "The only complaint is that I wanted more Lying Cat, but it is PERFECTION.

Finally! Imo Volume 4 of Saga is the best so far. It's fast paced, the stories are great (it's finally going somewhere), it's more complex and the drawings and characters development improve much further. If the quality of this volume continue to the rest of the series, I can see why Saga received the acclaim it gets.Marko, Hazel, Alana have changing and more complex relationship now. However, the best characters goes to Prince Robot IV and The Robot Janitor, without those two I really don't see the plot going anywhere great. Especially The Robot Janitor, his appearance really make the story much more intriguing.I read the entire volume straight within 40 minutes cause it was so addictive.

Who cares! So it starts out with Prince tv heads wife has a son while he is off in the twilight zone. <---Read book 3. Said baby gets stolen by another tv head for a certain cray cray reason. Well, maybe it's not too crazy. I mean he had a point about his kids, but I digress. Meanwhile, Marko, Alana, Hazel, Klara and Izabel are all hiding out. Well mostly Alana, Marko and Hazel since they go out in public. Alana is a cool star in a tv show and gets to play dress up and beat up bad guys and stuff. And her and Marko are having some issues. But they make up when it comes to Hazel and I think they are still in love, just tough times with all that going on right? Marko puts on some disguise that's not really a disguise to me, but whatever works :-DThe prince tv head gets some of his senses back and is told about his son being stolen so he's on a mission. While said person that stole his son is out on his mission and killing people, er, things left and right. Oh yeah and I forgot to mention that Hazel has a new pet named Friendo :-) Anyhoo, some stuff happens I can't tell you about and the ending is super awesome!

It's too bad that this volume decided to kick me more in the feels than that heartbreaking episode, but I digress. This volume really highlights the struggle of \"non-practical\" house dynamics. Alana is now a working mother, and Marko is now a stay-at-home dad. The resentment from both sides is really hurting their relationship and it was really hard to see/read about. Seeing Hazel narrate the events is even more painful. Hazel is such an amazing character, and she's only going through toddlerhood. Every panel with her made me feel so many emotions. Brian K. Vaughan is seriously a genius for creating Hazel, and his voice in Saga truly makes this series one of the best comics ever made. Also, I'm sort of loving Prince Robot IV now, so... I have to give the man credit for that, too. I haven't hated and then loved a character for a very long time. Especially with such little time to do so in comics. I love seeing all the different parts of this intricate story come together. I think the finale is going to be something amazing and beyond words.I'm now going to break down each chapter in this bind up. There will be SPOILERS, so please use caution in continuing if you have not read this graphic-novel, Vol. 1, Vol. 2, or Vol. 3!\nCHAPTER NINETEEN:\nPrince Robot IV's son is born in the Robot Kingdom, but Prince Robot IV is still missing. Marko, Alana, Hazel, Klara, and Izabel are on a new planet named Gardenia, where Alana is living out one of her dreams of being an actress on the Open Circuit. Because of this job, we see the first signs of Alana and Marko's relationship being in a not so great spot. \nCHAPTER TWENTY:\nPrince Robot IV is alive, and is in the brothel that the Will saved Sophie from. We meet Yuma, who works with Alana and is a drug dealer. Alana takes some of the drug Fadeaway, and soon becomes addicted. Marko is becoming friends with Hazel's dance teacher, Ginny, and we see more foreshadowing on how Marko and Alana's relationship is at a low point. Dengo, a robot janitor, kills Princess Robot and takes their newborn son. He talks about his son's death, wanting retribution, and it really hit home for me, because his son died from drinking bad water, from a city no one cares about, without any health insurance to heal his son. I'm from Flint, Michigan, so that parallel to Dengo's pain really resonates with me, and is very important to me.\nCHAPTER TWENTY ONE:\nThis is the chapter where we really see the struggle of Marko being a stay at home dad, while Alana is the major breadwinner of the family. Alana is taking more Fadeaway to escape her problems, but it isn't working. We learn Gwen is still missing.\nCHAPTER TWENTY TWO:\nAlana is becoming more and more addicted to the Fadeaway drug, all while Ginny is hanging out more and more with Marko. They have a huge fight, and it looks inconsolable. We meet Prince Robot IV's dad, King Robot, and he's a big jerk. Dengo comes to the Open Circuit so he can broadcast a message to the masses, but ends up shooting a lot of Alana's coworkers. \nCHAPTER TWENTY THREE:\nAfter Alana and Marko's fight, Marko goes to Ginny's house. I was honestly going to scream if anything happened. But after seeing a toy Hazel left behind, Marko leaves to bring it back to her. Dengo is still trying to broadcast his message, but Yuma, before being shot, tells Dengo about Hazel. Izabel, the ghost babysitter, talks about her ex-girlfriend, how she died, and how important love is. Honestly, this chapter had some of my favorite panels, ever. Marko arrives at the ship, right when it is taking off - with Dengo inside. Prince Robot IV finally shows up and sees Yuma and Marko, who is now separated from his family.\nCHAPTER TWENTY FOUR:\nThe Will's sister, The Brand, is interviewing the adorable Gus, from the previous installments, about the walrus he trades to Hazel and her family, Friendo. Sophie, Gwen, and Lying Cat are looking for a formula to save the Will's life. They all find out that Gus is able to track Friendo, so they will be able to find Hazel, Alana, Klara, and Izabel, too. We then find out that Marko is working with Prince Robot IV and Yuma to get their families back. I love this world, these planets, and these characters. Saga has the reputation for being the best comic series out there for a reason. It truly is at a tier above the rest, and I'm not sure what I'm going to do with myself once I finish the last installment. I love these characters too much to let them go.

I think I'll forever be in awe that somebody actually drew you into existence. The Lying cat is turning out to be one of my favorite characters from this series. Loyal pets that end up saving the day always make for the best characters. I still don't give a damn about Alana and Marko and their boring issues, but I really like the Grandma and how Ghus has entered the picture. After all the bloodshed and things you can't unsee because it's all so graphic, the cuteness factor Ghus provides is almost mandatory.The one thing that I can't get used to though is how everything just happens all at once and it's over before I can even realize that something actually happened.

Just as I got up to date with the story and thrilled to be back in the universe created by Vaughan and Staple, I am left hanging from the cliff by my fingernails, or better yet, twiddling my thumbs and looking for another comic to read until the next six-pack comes along. I remember reading  Y - The Last Man  in a similar rush, but I had the advantage of coming to the comic after it was finished, and had no problems following the plot and identifying the characters. With my feeble memory skills, six months is a bit long to be put on hold, and Vaughan storytelling style, with minimalist character background and development beside the major three (Alana, Marko and Hazel) is not making things easier. The reader is supposed to figure the plot out from fragmented and incomplete information. Usually, by book six of each arc, most of these plot holes are revealed, but new ones are introduced to build up interest for the next installment. There are also new characters to get acquainted with in each new six-pack, who may or may not play an important role later on.All these grumbles can be resumed into a wish to have all the story already published and then maybe I could give Saga the whole 5 stars it deserves. Until this happens, the major point of attraction for me remains the artwork of Fiona Staples, beautifully seconded by the colorist. I am also interested in the way Vaughan constructs a space opera but remains focused on a finite number of characters, and on family drama instead of flashy orbital battles. There is a strong anti-war flavour to his writing, which I admire, and some social commentary (like the effects on drug abuse on family dynamics, or the use of sex in popular entertainment). I do wish Vaughan would tone down the gratuitous swearing, but this is his story, not mine.I don\u2019t really know if it is useful to try my hand at a synopsis for album no. 4, since for me it is a bridge section, middle of the series installment. Alana and Marko, after their long (three books) running away from the secret services of their respective governments who view them as traitors for fraternizing with the enemy, have been holed down on a fringe planet. Here, their mixed race daughter Hazel has been growing up. I guess she\u2019s about three in this story arc. Alana is forced to work as an actress in a pay-per-view theatre in order to provide for her family, a stressful job with little satisfactions. She starts using drugs to help her slog through her weary days. Marko is a stay-at-home dad, forced to always wear a mask to hide his identity. He gets involved with a single mother he meets in the plaground. Hazel is supervised mostly by her ghostly babysitter and by her grandmother, while the parents are drifting apart without even noticing the cracks in their relationship.A parallel story follows the developments in the Robot Kingdom, where Prince IV is holed up in a space bordello, while his wife gives birth to his son and heir. Social inequality in the kingdom, and some personal grief, pushes one of his subjects to attack the palace and to kidnap the young robot heir. The two stories will probably intersect and bring to the fifth album a more action oriented plot. Some side characters from the previous albums also have guest appearances, mostly bounty hunters and their pets.The ending is a cliffhanger, as I already mentioned, a deliberate (and succesful as far as I am concerned) move to make the reader eager to find out what will happen in the next book."}, {"userName": "Paige (Enchantology)", "userReviewDate": "Feb 28, 2015", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/8831534-paige-enchantology", "userReview": "I don't know why I always think it's a good idea to read these while I'm at the library.
