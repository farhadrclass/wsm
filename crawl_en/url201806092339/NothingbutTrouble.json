Maggie's father, who studied at MIT, died before she was born, and her mother is so busy that Maggie is left to her own devices, taking apart vacuum cleaners and selling her grandfather's collection of vintage auto parts online. When Lena moves to twon, the two immediately connect, and Maggie starts sharing her father's philosophy of \"hacking\" with Lena, and getting her help in setting up elaborate pranks at their school, which is going to be closed at the end of the year. When the \"mouse\" pranks take off, the girls enter the mouse as a candidate for class president. Will the girls be able to pull off the ultimate prank of having an imaginary character win?Packed with interesting characters, such as Mrs. Dornbusch, who is in her last year of teaching and doesn't care about anything, an the perfect Kayla who was once friends with Maggie but is now her nemesis, Nothing But Trouble manages to put a new spin on the idea of class elections, and set the story in a dying community that is open to a little bit of excitement. Maggie's pranks follow the very strict rules that her father left in a notebook-- nothing can be damaged, the site has to be left in a better state than it was found, and no one can be hurt. It seems a bit unlikely that she would be able to do all of the things she does in real life, but I appreciated the fact that she had a significant source of income-- selling her grandfather's car parts-- to use to bankroll the projects. Teachers will appreciate the math and science connections scattered throughout the book and explained with notes at the end. Readers who enjoyed books with girls interested in math and science, such as The Short Seller, Calpurnia Tate, or A Girl Named Ratchet will enjoy Maggie's experiments, and readers who liked this author's The Lemonade War will be glad to see a story with new characters and a new setting."}, {"userName": "Diane Whittaker", "userReviewDate": "Mar 13, 2018", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/35112761-diane-whittaker", "userReview": "Fun! is how I would describe this book.

This book was a bit hard to review. Mainly because it was hard to find the plot in the story but also because this book was longer than my other books I read. The story goes is that Maggie lives in a small casual town named Odawahaka. The only exception is Maggie herself likes to cause trouble all over town. Then a new girl named Lena moves in who is a bigger prankster then Maggie. After the principal decides to resign from Oda M (the town\u2019s middle school) the two girls think it\u2019s time for them to stop doing what they like doing, pulling pranks. This time the author sorts chapters very well by numbering them, make a little drawing for every chapter, and of course starts one on a new page! Just the way it should be! Speaking of making a little drawing, while there is no pictures each page number has a neat little drawing of a ball bouncing off the floor which is always nice to see in a book. If there is one thing I can criticize, it\u2019s the lack of cinematic like effect. These include italics different fonts etc. \u201cMy Fellow Oda Mice I have lived in the walls of this school for many years, ...and after this year Oda M will be no more. (231) When the book is trying to show the reader an important event like this especially with a different character, it can leave the read off track later on but that\u2019s just my opinion. If I had to say something, this was the best book I have read so far, and I hope That Davies can make even greater books."}, {"userName": "Carol Royce Owen", "userReviewDate": "Aug 02, 2017", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/1888096-carol-royce-owen", "userReview": "A locker filled with tennis balls, ping pong balls falling on the principal's head during an assembly, mini purple explosions on the gym floor, and declarations of a mystery mouse as the culprit of these and many more pranks going on at Odawahaka Middle School, where sixth grade students are the only students. Have the students been forgotten, or is it true the town just doesn't have the money to house them anywhere else than this old building destined to be destroyed next year? One thing is for sure, and that is Maggie is tired of living in this tiny town where everyone knows your comings and goings, and wishes her mom would take them far away. But her mom has become as complacent as the town. When all the craziness starts happening at the school, Maggie and new friend Lena start to believe that big things can happen even in little old Oda M, but there's a new principal at the school, and he's bent on stopping all of the tomfoolery and chaos taking over the school.I enjoyed this book, and think students will enjoy them, too, but there were many times where I felt like the level of the pranks being pulled were much more than 6th grade students could pull off, no matter how bright they were. I was glad the author addressed the question of where the money came from to pull all of these pranks off, but I just feel as though the students should have been a bit older.Still, a good, fun book that I think students will enjoy."}, {"userName": "Sarah", "userReviewDate": "May 19, 2017", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/987336-sarah", "userReview": "Nothing But Trouble is nothing but fun. Truly! Admittedly, I often do judge a book but its cover. Noting that author Jacqueline Davies had previously penned the Lemonade War series my snobbish side came out in full force. Passing Lemonade Mouth (aka Puckered Lips?) on the shelves I didn't even give it a second glance. Fortunately, I opted to give Nothing But Trouble a go and was richly rewarded. Charming, relatable main characters, Maggie and Lena, take on middle school through a series of highly sophisticated \"hacks\" leaving the whole school on its toes. Wholesome but not in a overly saccharine Brady Bunch way. As an added bonus there is quite a bit of science involved in their clever schemes which certainly awakened my interests in a subject I've sometimes written off as dull. Would make a terrific choice for girls not of the fantasy/sci-fi ilk but not yet gearing up for pre-teen romance either. Laws of physics explained in an engaging manner at the back of the book. I just may be puckering up for some Lemonade after all."}, {"userName": "Rachel", "userReviewDate": "Mar 13, 2018", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/71889022-rachel", "userReview": "I think this book is good so far, it is about a girl named Maggie that lives in a little place called Odawahaka. Maggie lives with her grandfather and loves anything science. There is a new principal at the school, and he is a grumpy one. In the beginning, it is the first day of school for Maggie and shes having trouble talking to her friends, who are closer to each other than her. When Maggie hides in a bush to avoid them, she meets a new girl named Lena. When she gets to school there is tennis balls and cheese everywhere. Someone pranked the middle school. Then, everyone gets their homeroom, and Maggie is in the same homeroom as the new girl. She is also assigned to the same table with her at lunch. The two end up becoming really good friends and come up with hilarious pranks and science experiments together. I would recommend this book to anyone who loves DCF books.

The main character lives in a single parent home with her elderly ailing grandfather and spends her time devising elaborate pranks to play on the mean and stupid school principal. Enter the new girl in town, less of an inventor and mechanical engineer, she is artistic and worldly wiser, though she is often left alone by her artistic parents as they pursue their own careers. The story is a veritable \"turn the school upside down\" by pranking to overthrow the dictatorial school principal. This book has been nominated by the Council for the Vermont's Children's Choice Dorothy Canfield Fisher Award and is recommended by that group for children across Vermont schools and libraries."}, {"userName": "Richelle", "userReviewDate": "Dec 26, 2017", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/7366807-richelle", "userReview": "Pretty good book about a girl who loves to hack (in this case hacking basically means pranking).

But she never met him, as he died before she was born. She spends lots of time planning and executing astonishing hacks at her middle school, and funds them by selling auto parts her seriously disabled grandfather has stored in the basement.

So when artsy Lena moves to their teeny town and figures out easily what Maggie is up to, she has a comrade in arms for the first time ever.
