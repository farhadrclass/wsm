Many have happy memories of her wholesome stories from childhood, and introduce their own children (and grandchildren) to them. Characters such as Noddy have found their way into popular culture worldwide, and many of her stories have been updated to remove the worse of their offensive content in terms of racial, cultural and gender stereotypes. When possible I try to find an original \u201cunexpurgated\u201d copy to review, rather than the sanitised versions.Enid Blyton\u2019s Sunshine Book was first published in 1965, although reprinted many times, and intended for children of around 7-9 years old. It contains a mixture of 30 stories, factual pieces and poems. Each story is just a few pages long, with a line drawing on almost every page. The two nonfiction pieces are about Nature, comprising \u201cA Country Walk in England: Spring and Summer\u201d and the same for \u201cAutumn and Winter\u201d. These are interesting articles, presented in an old-fashioned but chatty way, with good close-up sketches making it easy for a child to identify the different plants and so on. The poems are verse poems, varying in length, with a simple rhyming structure, and again, often about Nature and the seasons.The stories are a mixture of the familiar and fantasy stories. Enid Blyton liked her pixies, brownies and elves, and these pepper the pages. All the stories are feel-good stories, and most of them have a moral message. On the plus side, they are from a simpler time, with little to object to, and stories which keen readers will devour as they are fast-moving page-turners. On the minus side, they are very dated, for instance in style, with lots of cosy addressing of the reader, such as, \u201cdear children\u201d, or twee questions as the end of each story, such as: \u201cI wish I knew whether they did learn [their lesson] or not. Do you think they did?\u201dEnid Blyton wrote such a wealth of stories that some are inevitably pot-boilers. I had high hopes of this one though, as the fantasy element seemed to be quite imaginative. I particularly liked: \u201cFather Time and his Pattern Book\u201d where a little boy, Robin, wakes up in the middle of the night on New Year\u2019s Eve, and sees a strange old man in the garden, who says he is \u201ccollecting patterns\u201d. The patterns seem to be long scrolls, and each depicts the previous year of someone Robin knows. Some patterns consisted of bright threads, and some were filled with ugly little lines of black dots. Robin got to recognise what sort of a year each had had: whether they had perhaps behaved selfishly, or allowed themselves to become lazy or unhappy. He saw the beautiful patterns made by those who had behaved well, helped others and tried to achieve a lot in their year. Then Robin asked to see his own pattern, which glowed in places, where he had been happy. It was a strong steady pattern, to show that he worked hard. Silver pools shining in his pattern showed where he had been kind, and silver pools shone too in his friends\u2019 patterns, for their memories of him. But there were a few grey smudges, which showed where Robin had started to tell untruths.The story ends with Robin wondering if the old man\u2019s visit had been a dream, but also resolving to have a beautiful pattern next year. This was a clever story, blending the fantasy element with the homilies that Enid Blyton so loved.Another story I enjoyed was \u201cSanta Claus is Surprising\u201d, where a class of children all make lists of the presents they are going to buy or make for their family and friends, as well as the ones they hope to receive. The \u201csurprise\u201d was that at a party only those who had shown a lot of thought for the presents they gave received presents from Santa Claus. There is an exciting story called \u201cAn Aventurous Evening\u201d, where two children catch a burglar. Another I liked was \u201cThe Enchanted Egg\u201d in which Sly-One the gnome searched all the different types of nests to find somewhere to hide the magic egg he had stolen, before it hatched. This story also has a hidden function. Alongside the lesson learned by the gnome that it is wrong to steal, children learn several different types of birds\u2019 nests, and about the behaviour of birds such as the cuckoo. With folk-tale type stories of goblins and elves, this was looking to be a solid 3 star read, until the final seven stories. They seemed to feel familiar, and not just because of the unmistakable Enid Blyton style. Puzzled, I looked on my shelves.Sure enough there they all were, in another book entitled \u201cThe Happy House Children\u201d. That book itself was a reprint of two earlier ones, as it included \u201cMore stories of the Happy House Children\u201d, but at least it was honest about this on the cover. I felt let down, and cheated of my seven new stories at the end. Shame on the publishers! Enid Blyton was prolific enough, without resorting to this cheap trick. I don\u2019t think she would have approved at all.\u201cWhat do you think, girls and boys?\u201d"}, {"userName": "Shaznie Mardhiah", "userReviewDate": "Jul 17, 2017", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/30790849-shaznie-mardhiah", "userReview": "re-read"}, {"userName": "Redfox5", "userReviewDate": "Sep 07, 2016", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/3816075-redfox5", "userReview": "Am I too old to be reading Enid Blyton books? Am I too old to be enjoying them? Nah!  This is a collection of short stories that I've not read before. I can't help think that perhaps my sisters got a load of Blyton books after I \"outgrew\" them, as there seem to be a few I've read recently that I've not read before.  I would go as far to call this book charming. I can't really fault any of the stories. I like that all the good kids get rewards in this book and all the naughty ones get smacked. No excuses made for the naughty ones here! (I say kids but one is a goblin). I feel there is a sense of fairness to Blyton's work.  Would recommend for the young and the old."}, {"userName": "Angel 'ine", "userReviewDate": "Sep 11, 2011", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/5817950-angel-ine", "userReview": "One of my favorite childhood books!"}, {"userName": "Maddy", "userReviewDate": "Jul 27, 2009", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/2531628-maddy", "userReview": "there are lots of pages missing in the copy i have!!!"}], "description": "", "title": "Sunshine Book (Rewards)", "url": "http://www.goodreads.com/book/show/34920973-sunshine-book", "average": 3.73, "cover": "https://images.gr-assets.com/books/1492769003l/34920973.jpg", "reviews": 5, "authors": [{"url": "https://www.goodreads.com/author/show/10657.Enid_Blyton", "name": "Enid Blyton"}], "type": ["Childrens"], "outlinks": ["http://www.goodreads.com/book/show/34920973-sunshine-book", "http://www.goodreads.com/book/show/2178263.Sunshine_Book", "http://www.goodreads.com/book/show/31869012-sunshine-book", "http://www.goodreads.com/book/show/74998.The_Magic_Faraway_Tree", "http://www.goodreads.com/book/show/17491.The_Enchanted_Wood", "http://www.goodreads.com/book/show/17488.Five_on_a_Treasure_Island", "http://www.goodreads.com/book/show/473623.The_Folk_of_the_Faraway_Tree", "http://www.goodreads.com/book/show/17490.The_Faraway_Tree_Stories"]}
