Greenwich Village in the early 60s! Beat Generation artists! I thought this book would be right up my alley. But sixty or so pages in, I was getting very dismayed. I was finding it very hard to care about the protagonist, Eve, or, for that matter, anyone else including the ghost. But I kept with it, and the story slowly found its legs and gathered itself into a run, with the second half being reasonably satisfying. Eve Weldon has just moved from the Midwest to Greenwich Village, NY, the place where she knows her mother was happiest- possibly the only place she ever was happy. She goes there expecting to find this same happiness; expecting, really, that nothing has changed in the Village in 50 years. It\u2019s a shock to her when most of the places her mother spoke of- the bars and cafes- are gone. It\u2019s also a shock to her that she is not given instant entree to groups of young people talking about art and writing that her mother spoke of- Eve goes into the one bar that her mother frequented that still exists and is crushed that the patrons ignore her rather than joyously greeting her, recognizing her as a fellow intellectual. This sounds like a teenager, but Eve is in her 30s. Among other things, this novel is a belated coming of age story. Eve must find a job on her own for the first time in her life (she\u2019s been working for her father since graduation), must navigate finding a date without already knowing everything about the man, and must figure out what she really wants to do. It\u2019s also a bit of a detective story, weaving together the past lives of Donald- the ghost of a Beat writer who never made good (who gives dictation to Eve, so his life\u2019s work can be completed)-; Klieg, a famous fashion designer who is soured on life; and Eve\u2019s long dead mother. And it\u2019s also a paean to the intellectual life of the Beats, and an expos\u00e9 of sorts of how the morning TV shows work.While Eve never really did grow on me, the story did. The back stories of Donald and Klieg really make the book. I loved the author\u2019s use of the vintage clothing that Eve inherited from her mother as a symbol of Eve trying to inhabit the past. I liked the ending. But the book tried to go in too many directions and some of it wasn\u2019t woven together very well. It\u2019s another case of a first novel not getting enough editing- good in parts but a lot of things should have been jettisoned."}, {"userName": "Nancy", "userReviewDate": "Jun 28, 2011", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/3122452-nancy", "userReview": "My original reaction to the writer's strike a few years ago was irritation. This was, after all, the last year of Scrubs, which I loved. So why did the strike impact Conan O'Brien and David Letterman? Ah, you see, they don't actually write their own stuff. I assume this would also include Rosie O'Donnell and Ellen who find terribly sincere and clever. Again, it's the writers.So our protagonist, Eventual Weldon, makes her way from Ohio to New York and snaps up a job as writer for a morning show. The way is sticky, however, and paved with politics you don't even want to cross. Unwittingly Eve will as many writers have done in the past. I found it very interesting to see the back workings of interviews and segments. Not even Oprah could do everything that needs to be done. A booker contacts the guest and the writer is given only a few hours to write a cohesive, intelligent introduction, be well read and current on all topics, call the guest and flesh out interesting directions for the interview then write a script for the segment down to the second. The job of the writer is to provide a script that makes the anchor look brilliant and clever. The interview questions are to be intelligent and provide a platform for the guest to tell the story but above all, the anchor must look good.Donald, the ghost, was an interesting distraction but ultimately did not capture my attention as much as the inner workings of a network. The back story is that Eve is looking for evidence of her mother's existence in Beatnik New York from the 1960's. Meanwhile, Eve shares an apartment with a ghost named Donald who lived at the same time in New York with Eve's mother but didn't know her but he is obsessed with publishing his lost works and wants Eve to transcribe for him.It was an enjoyable book and the writing is solid. The ending lacked a cohesive resolution for me. I would have liked to have the stories for interconnected for my tastes. Still, it's a good read."}, {"userName": "Sandie", "userReviewDate": "Dec 11, 2012", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/146995-sandie", "userReview": "Eve Weldon is living her fantasy life. Growing up in the Midwest, her mother dying early, left Eve lonely and longing for more. She has worked in her father\u2019s law office for several years but now she has decided to follow in her mother\u2019s footsteps. Her mother had a mysterious past that centered around the time she lived in Greenwich Village as a young woman before she married and had a family. Eve\u2019s fondest memories of her mother center around the stories she told of her time there, and the wonderful writing community she was a part of.Gathering her courage, Eve takes off for New York. She is lucky enough to find an apartment she can afford, and soon she worms her way into a writing job. The apartment, unfortunately, is haunted by the ghost of a Beat writer, but Eve tries to ignore the downside and takes pride in being the only one who can experience Donald\u2019s existence. He is full of stories about the same group that Eve\u2019s mother was a part of, and she delves into his life to discover more about her mother. The job is also an issue. Eve tries several things to shine, but each seems to backfire. Can she make a secure life in this new environment, or will it prove to be too much for her, leaving her to head back home to a more routine existence?Lorna Graham has written a charming, inspiring tale that will delight the reader\u2019s heart. Eve is a character it is hard not to love. Her ingenuity, resourcefulness, and determination to make her dreams a reality draw the reader into her world. Along the way, the Greenwich Village lifestyle of the 1960\u2019s is lovingly portrayed.

E' magico e ti trascina nell'atmosfera di una New York magica e non descritta come la grande metropoli, quale \u00e8, ma ci porta sulle tracce di scrittori passati degli anni Sessanta che con le loro opere sono ancora capaci di incantarci e di accompagnarci lungo tutto il nostro cammino. Eve, la protagonista, \u00e8 una ragazza semplice e sotto molti punti di vista molto simile a me, anche se io non ho nessun fantasma che infesta la mia casa!, e non \u00e8 difficile immedesimarsi in lei.

I have to be honest. This isn't a book that I would think to recommend to people because I struggled through it. Here's the thing. I didn't like Eve. I don't like people like Eve. People like Eve are people who have a hard time adjusting to the real world. Now, never having lost a parent I can't say how I would feel if I lost my mom. But I will tell you- never would I feel the need to try to re-live my mother's life, which is very much what Eve is trying to do. It seems to me that it would be obvious that the times and life of an area would be very much different several generations apart... but Eve doesn't seem to get that. I also didn't understand the whole Donald thing. Yes, he's a ghost. Yes, he wants Eve to write his book and she learns a lot about the generations and her new fashion designer friend because of Donald. But... the whole character and story line of Donald is just so.... off. I don't know. I had a hard time even wanting to read sections of the book where he's present because it didn't make sense. Why even have that as a character or part of the story line? The parts of this book that I found fascinating was the hustle and bustle of her working on a morning show. Not only was it interesting to somewhat learn about that type of job, but it seemed more of a real life scenario that could happen to a single woman coming to the big city from the Midwest. THAT part of the story made absolute sense. Often times I felt myself thinking Eve was kind of a dumb girl who, though she has real world experience and a great education, she is a person you'd pass up and assume she's just another idiot in the big city. I wouldn't feel sorry for her or her plight if she was one of my friends. Which sounds terrible...but it's true. Now, if you enjoy a chick lit book, or if you like stories about women trying to empower themselves- this would be a good book for you."}, {"userName": "Denise", "userReviewDate": "Sep 01, 2011", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/2673817-denise", "userReview": "Eve Weldon moves to Greenwich Village searching for a connection to her dead mother who was an artist there in the 1960's. Jobless and alone she is adrift in the big city until she rents an old apartment. She soon discovers that the ghost of a little known, beat generation author haunts her apartment. With his cranky advice and sometimes unhelpful guidance she soon finds herself with a writing job for a local tv show, a friendship with a famous, avant garde fashion designer, and a budding social life. But the ghost has secrets and as Eve spends more and more time with him she begins to have suspisions that he is somehow connected to her mother.The Ghost of Greenwich Village is an immature effort from a possibly promising author. The main storyline, Eve's relationship with the ghost, Donald, and her unraveling of his secrets, is cluttered with unnecesary details and mysterious subplots that aren't interesting. Why have Donald present himself to Eve in such an unusual, confusing way? It doesn't accomplish anything for the plot and just takes time and patience to wade through the explanation of how exactly he appears in her head. Its also baffling as to why Eve stays in the apartment, paying more rent than she can afford, for the sake of a ghost she most often dislikes and who is very inconvenient for her. On the other hand, many of the side stories about Eve's life outside the apartment were fun and imaginatively written. The morning talk show world and the dynamic between the stars and the writers was different and intriguing. The fashion designer also added a nice twist and glimpse into that glamorous world. The story has enough interesting parts to merit picking up Lorna Graham's next effort, but I won't be recommending this book to anyone.I listened to The Ghost of Greenwich Village on audio, narrated by Nicole Vilencia.She does well with the youthful, fanciful tones of Eve, but didn't quite manage the switch to a more serious, grumpy Donald."}, {"userName": "Carmen {Napolinlettura}", "userReviewDate": "Oct 25, 2015", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/43958421-carmen-napolinlettura", "userReview": "Leggero ma concluso male.E' stata una scoperta, per me. Non sono solita lasciarmi andare a letture di questo genere, nutro nei loro confronti qualche errato -ma neanche tanto- pregiudizio, per\u00f2 non potevo rifiutare di leggere un libro regalatomi da mia sorella. Dunque ho letto \"La ragazza del Greenwich Village\" in base alle seguenti motivazioni: pressione affettiva, nessuna traccia di interesse al genere, sbocciata curiosit\u00e0, voglia di sperimentare letture che mai mi auto-proporrei.

Eve wonders what her life would have been had she not died young. The only girl of four siblings, Eve has grieved for her mother and feels that retracing her steps will give her new insight.Eve arrives with no job and little money, and manages to snag a small apartment in Greenwich Village. She finds a job as a writer at the number two morning program on network TV. Oh, and did I mention the ghost? Soon after her arrival, the ghost of a writer in the Beat Generation begins communicating with her telepathically. He used to live in her apartment. After getting over the shock, Eve develops a relationship with Donald Bellows, a man who never fulfilled his potential, and died too young to be recognized for his talent.As Eve matures, as a writer and a woman, she learns fascinating details about the creative world in the mid-century. She also learns the heartbreaking stories of several of the talents involved. Lorna Graham has an encyclopedic knowledge of the period, mentioning clothing designers, artists, writers, and political movements of the time and I learned what a fascinating period it is. Since I was born in the fifties, I was too little to know much about many of the gifted artists mentioned, but I discovered so much about that period!I highly recommend this book, not as a mystery, but as a coming-of-age novel with an enormous gift of knowledge about an under-appreciated period in history.

The protagonist, Eve, is a writer for a morning talk show, the writer aspect an interesting revelation. That\u2019s right, everything uttered by Matt Lauer was written by someone else (indeed the author wrote for Katie Couric and Ann Curry). The dynamic in that world is fun to follow, especially as the writers are quite the dirty little secret, called \u201cstaffers\u201d by the talent. I was fascinated by the inner workings of putting together such a show and I found Eve\u2019s gang of fellow \u201cstaffers\u201d eclectic and compelling. In fact I wish her cohorts were featured in the plot more.The grouchy beatnik ghost is also a nice (and unique) element. I loved his descriptions of being a writer in Greenwich Village back in the day. It was easier to play the part of a starving artist then because the cafes and shops actually catered to creative individuals and wanted them to eat at their establishments, wear their clothes, etc. Lots of freebies like celebrities get now, the difference being the artists really needed them. There is much to like here, but I never really adored Eve. I wanted her to be fine and everything (I didn\u2019t hate her) but I didn\u2019t feel any angst when she was, at various points, in danger of losing her job and/or her apartment. Also a lot of the things in this book seemed overly coincidental or just flat out unrealistic (e.g. how Eve gets her job in the first place). In addition, the writing is a little corny at times.

'What about a little dictation? \"The Numbered Story\" is ready to pop out of me.' ... \"'One: I came upon a porcelain ladder. Two: It was up to me to scale it. Three: The ladder stands at the corner of Waverly and Waverly. Four: The polished rungs glinted in the sun, daring me to try it.' \"'Um, Donald?

Five: People went about their business. Six: They are intimidated by anyone extraordinary.' \"Who would want to read this? The subject matter was tedious and the numbers were just strange. 'Donald, are you sure about this?' Eve asked. 'What are these numbers for? I'm not sure they work. They sort of break up the narrative, don't you think?' \"'Thank you for that bit of bright and shiny \"Intro to Fiction\" analysis. You don't know what you're talking about,' he said. 'I'm breaking up the \"narrative\" in order to call into questions the whole notion of narrative.'\" Donald is the demanding, yet not without charm ghost, but Eve leads a ghostly existence herself. She is haunted by her mother's untimely death and the magical stories of her mother's colorful bohemian existence in 1960s Greenwich Village. All her life she's been the dutiful yet overlooked daughter; though in an uncharacteristic show of independence, she decides to move to New York, seduced by her mother's memories. The only job she lands is as a behind-the-scenes writer at a t.v. show, drafting interview questions, clever banter, and quips for anchors to claim as their own. Besides Donald the ghost, she has no real friends in New York - she is as invisible and as voiceless as a disembodied spirit. How Eve breaks through this cloak of invisibilty and finds her voice is at the heart of this novel. There are so many entertaining elements in The Ghost of Greenwich Village - Donald's high brow ways serve as comic relief. The stories he dictates to Eve are so ridiculous and laden with odd symbolism that I burst out laughing many times. Reminiscences of Greenwich Village of the beatnik days - speakeasies, meaningful conversations about art, writing, poetry - seem so magical. If you're at all infatuated with the idea of New York as an artist's haven, you would love these parts of the book. The surprising, behind-the-scenes look at the inner workings of a t.v. show. I did not know that news shows have writers that create everything the anchors or hosts say; Ellen DeGeneres, Katie Couric, Tom Brokaw - almost everything they say on the air is written by somebody else, who is never called a writer, merely a staffer. They are the wizards behind the curtain who are never acknowledged. I suspect the author, former t.v. writer Lorna Graham, has cleverly paired the idea of ghost writing with a ghost who wants to write to expose this \"secret\" in a creative way. All these elements were fun to read about - separately. But thrown in together in this novel, they didn't mesh enough for me. The story seemed uneven, lacking something to bind all of these ingredients together seamlessly. I was irritated with Eve's endless patience with Donald's intrusion into her life and primadonna demands. Because of this, it took me awhile to warm up to the book. However, despite having the earmarks of a typical chick lit book (diligent attention paid to fashion, obsessing over potential romantic interests, the ability to afford an 1840s apartment in Manhattan with a low-paying job), it has enough unique elements to make this novel charming and atypical."}, {"userName": "Sonia", "userReviewDate": "Jul 15, 2011", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/3414021-sonia", "userReview": "Ci sono dei libri che sanno incantarti fin dall'inizio, ipnotizzandoti con la loro copertina che ha il sapore del fascino e dell'eleganza, stregandoti con quel titolo che ci riporta New York e il suo splendore, incatenandoti con una trama che una lettrice come me avrebbe voglia di vivere in prima persona...La ragazza del Greenwich Village non ha fatto che confermare le mie aspettative, rivelandosi un romanzo delizioso e piacevolissimo.L'ambientazione la fa da padrona: New York e suoi quartieri chic, inaspettatamente pieni di cultura, quei palazzi che all'occhio inesperto sembrerebbero anonimi, ma che si rivelano solo a chi cerca: orme di scrittori del passato, che l\u00ec hanno abitato, hanno vissuto, hanno amato.Una New York da vivere tra mostre di arte pazzesca ma stupenda, locali affollati ma di tendenza, passeggiate notturne da affrontare senza timore di ci\u00f2 che potrebbe accadere.E se quel timore non c'\u00e8, ma qualcosa accade, qualcosa di temibile, il risultato a New York \u00e8 che si diventa eroi per un giorno...Eventual Weldon, chiamiamola Eve, arriva a New York con una valigia piena di speranza, di aspettative, piena di sicurezza che tutto andr\u00e0 come lei vorr\u00e0.

Even though I prefer young adult books, I still wanted to read this because it seemed like a funny book.Now that I have read it I can tell you that this book was not really funny. I thought that Eve would have a great time in New York, meeting new people, making friends, falling in love etc. Well, I was wrong because Eve was not really an outgoing person. She was not very self-confident, was unsure about what she wanted and just couldn't speak her mind. I don't think that readers will like her therefore, because she isn't really the type of character that you can easily sympathize with. Still, I could understand that she missed her mother and I imagine how hard it was for her to grow up without her. And I can't say that I totally disliked her. She had her positive sides too. I especially liked the fact that she was so nice to Donald and that she was determined to help him, although he was really annoying most of the time. What I am trying to say is that if you expect a light, fun read then you're going to be disappointed because this book has a melancholic touch to it and its subject matter is really sad.But that doesn't mean that I didn't enjoy this book. I liked it despite the fact that Eve was not a really likable character. And the reason why I liked The Ghost of Greenwich Village is that I enjoyed reading about Eve's job at this morning news program. It was really interesting to learn about what happens behind the curtain and to learn that it's not really as glamorous as one expects. I also liked the parts about Eve's mother because that way we get to learn a little about her time in New York and how life was back then. And although Donald is not your typical ghost who scares the tenants, I still liked to find out why he was so odd, cynical and cold. And when I did find out what has happened to him, I could understand why he was behaving the way he did.What I didn't like about this book besides Eve was the fact that there was no romance. And I expected Eve to fall in love with her boss, but nothing happened because Mark was also a weird character who was to scared to speak his mind. So it was really disappointing that there was no romance in this book.The ending was also disappointing because I waited for so long for a specific scene, but the author chose not to show it and left it up to my imagination. Conclusion: All in all, The Ghost of Greenwich Village was still an enjoyable read and I would recommend it to all of those who want to learn more about the literary movement of the early sixties, about New York and about what goes on behind the curtain at a morning news program.Rating:3.5 out of 5 stars"}, {"userName": "Suzanne Christopher", "userReviewDate": "Sep 27, 2016", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/6881882-suzanne-christopher", "userReview": "I loved it!

Her mother's death in Eve's childhood only reinforced that desire to learn all about what life was like there for the artists during the Beat generation, and to resurrect in her mind what that artistic community was like.But when Eve finally leaves her home in the Midwest and arrives in NY to rent an old apartment in the Village, she discovers an unexpected resident: the ghost of Donald Bellows, a writer who haunts her whenever she is inside its walls. He needs her to complete his life's work, which he dictates to her, like a voice inside her head.Finding the right job takes effort, but when Eve lands a gig as a writer on a morning show called Smell the Coffee, she could be in over her head. Surprisingly, she lands the job, but then, from her first moment, she is scrambling to learn her craft, keep out of trouble, and to somehow jump-start a social life. All of which takes a supreme effort, since she cannot do much inside the walls of her home with the ghost clamoring in her ears.Following Eve's journey is captivating, as she hurdles all the obstacles along the way with aplomb. She very creatively manages a few difficult feats, including meeting some unique artists, like designer Matthias Klieg, who, incidentally, has known many of the Beat artists who traveled in Donald's circle. While uncovering the stories of that time, writing Donald's work, and hanging on to a semblance of a career, she takes a daring leap that could land her in a great place\u2014or end her life in the Village.What does Eve discover in her research, and how does the magic of the Village help Eve forge her new life? And how do the discoveries answer questions about her mother's life and role in that community? What will Eve's sojourn bring to her new life, even as it reconciles questions about her old one?I came to love the ghost of Donald Bellows, whose unique voice revealed much about a unique time in NY history. Eve's adventures and misadventures were delightful and took me, as the reader, into the midst of contemporary NY life, even as it led me down the pathways of another time. As a reader, I became invested in Eve's journey, wanting to walk where she walked and to enjoy her quest. \"The Ghost of Greenwich Village: A Novel\" was delightfully colorful, with fleshed out characters that made me laugh, even as I held my breath during their exploits. I couldn't wait to see what would happen next.

Glamor, fun,a great job or maybe romance...she wanted to find something. What she did find was a ghost inhabiting her apartment, (actually he resided in her head)and not just any ghost but a cranky writer ghost, a hold-over from the Beat Generation who wants to use Eve as his stenographer. Eve is also sure she is going to find a wonderful creative job and find a job she does. She finds a job with a morning, talk show called \"Smell the Coffee\", writing the scripts that the hosts make to look like their own words.While this is a perfectly fine first novel, I found that the only things I pulled from it was that Eve was portrayed as a sort of clich\u00e9d and somewhat na\u00efve mid-westerner with an annoyingly cloying sweet personality, who tried too hard to capture what her Mother found while living in the Village.The ghost aspect of the story could have been quite charming and is one of the hooks that drew me to this book. But instead of something novel and interesting, I found the ghost (Donald) to be abrasive , annoying and one of the least likeable characters I've encountered in a long time. I do understand what the author was trying to do by inserting the ghost aspect of the story, but it just did not sit well with me.What I did learn from this book is that if it is true that authors should write about what they know; then Ms. Graham did an excellent job of teaching me things that I didn't know and perhaps never wanted to know about the morning shows (or perhaps even straight news shows). I truly wish the parts about Eve and her relationships with the \"Smell the Coffee\" employees had been expanded, and that some of the relationships had been broadened.I learned more about the fashions from that era and culture of the Beat Generation than I ever knew before, so this book did teach me something. Unfortunately, I thought I was going to be reading a more whimsical type of book so what the book did contain disappointed me a bit. This is by no means a horrible book, it is quite good in parts, but you may need a lot of patience to see Eve grow and shed some of `girlish' and somewhat spoiled and whiny attitude."}, {"userName": "Themistokeles", "userReviewDate": "Jan 30, 2016", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/7462201-themistokeles", "userReview": "Dieses Buch hat mir auf jeden Fall bewiesen, dass man dem Klappentext oftmals besser keinen gro\u00dfen Glauben schenken sollte. Besonders falsch an diesem Klappentext war vor allen Dingen er letzte Satz, der mir den Eindruck vermittelte, dass es sich um einen lustigen Roman mit vielen witzigen Dates handelt, an deren Verlauf Donalds nicht ganz unschuldig ist. Aber weit gefehlt! Denn genau mit so was kann der Roman nicht dienen, sondern eher mit dem vollkommenen Gegenteil.Manche Szenen in dem Roman sind zwar auch am\u00fcsant, aber insgesamt gibt es deutlich mehr ernste Szenen, denn der Roman ist doch ein St\u00fcck tiefg\u00e4ngiger, als man vielleicht denken mag. Statt nur um einen am\u00fcsanten Geist handelt es sich bei Donald eher um einen zu fr\u00fch verstorbenen K\u00fcnstler, der noch einigem in seinem alten Leben nachtrauert und tiefe Risse in seiner Seele hat. Jedoch macht seine Art ihn auch ab und an recht lustig und Eve das Leben schwer, da sie wegen Donald keins ihrer Dates, denn die gibt es schon irgendwie, in ihre Wohnung lassen mag.Es ist aber auf jeden Fall ein interessantes Buch, wenn man sich f\u00fcr das leben der Beat-Generation und ihre Autoren in New York interessiert, wie auch das Leben in den 50er und 60er Jahren, da sich damit durch Eve sehr viel besch\u00e4ftigt wird. Auch die Mode dieser Zeit ist ein sehr relevantes Thema f\u00fcr das Buch, aber vor allen Dingen die Gef\u00fchle und Erinnerungen, denen Eve nachsp\u00fcrt auf den Pfaden ihrer Mutter wandelnd und die Probleme mit denen Eve im Alltag k\u00e4mpfen muss, um in New York bleiben zu k\u00f6nnen, da sie unbedingt ihre Forschungen in Bezug auf ihre Mutter weiterf\u00fchren will.Vieles davon ist recht tiefgreifend und emotional geschildert und einiges auch spannend oder lustig, aber allein schon von der Atmosph\u00e4re her, die versucht das New York zweier sehr unterschiedlicher Epochen zu verbinden, stimmt der Roman einfach nicht mit einer lustigen Schulze \u00fcberein, wie ich sie erwartet h\u00e4tte.Es macht aber Spa\u00df den Roman zu lesen, wenn man sich darauf einlassen kann, dass er anders ist als erwartet und doch eine sehr spezielle Zeit beleuchtet. Und man kann auch noch so einiges lernen, wenn man sich bisher mit den Autoren und dem New York dieser Zeit nicht so auskennt."}, {"userName": "Caitlin", "userReviewDate": "Jul 20, 2011", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/4209786-caitlin", "userReview": "Actually bought this book IN Greenwich Village after finding my new apartment - so it seemed like a perfect choice -- and based on the glowing reviews on the cover, I was ready to absolutely adore it.In the end it was a cute read, but nothing spectacular. Felt very jumbled a lot of the time, as if Eve (the protagonist) was living three entirely different \"day job\" as a writer for a morning TV talk show, then there's her friendship with a veteran fashion designer and her encounters with his family... then of course there's Donald, the \"Ghost\" himself, as referenced in the title. The ghost plot line was the least fulfilling, as the book begins with Eve already acquainted with her apartment's resident ghost - so there is no exciting moment of revelation when she discovers his presence... and no need for the author to figure out how to write the first meeting between Eve and Donald so that it is actually believable. Also - Donald never physically appears to Eve - he just plants ideas in head. Not much of a relationship between these two seemingly important characters, and I was never entirely convinced that Eve hadn't just gone a bit crazy and was hearing voices in her head, rather than an actual ghost :)The book made several stabs at being \"romantic\" as well, but after trotting out 3 suitors who we as readers think we're supposed to care about, and then have them fizzle away into nothingness without any sort of resolution, it's hard to classify this book as really having romantic elements at all. In the end, there is a hint that Eve might have a fledgling relationship in the works -- but the man in question is such a 2-dimensional character that the reader has trouble caring whether Eve ever makes anything happen with him at all.I *did* love the book's Greenwich Village setting, and the talk of the historic plaques marking where various authors lived in the neighborhood (since I will soon be living in a building that has its own red historical plaque just like the ones described in the book!) And it all wraps up pretty well in the end, it just takes so long, and then happens so quickly, over the course of about the last 10-15 pages, that it's hard to care as much as I would have liked to."}, {"userName": "Colleen Turner", "userReviewDate": "Aug 30, 2011", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/3339335-colleen-turner", "userReview": "Originally reviewed for the blog Reader Unboxed.The Ghost of Greenwich Village is a unique gem of a story. On the surface it\u2019s the story of a girl who moved to New York from the Midwest in the hopes of finding herself and the essence of her mother, Penelope, amongst the bustle and excitement of the city her mother loved so much. Move a layer deeper and you find Eve struggling as a true ghost writer, not only as an under-appreciated, hidden writer for a day time news show but as the often unwilling writer for the ornery, uppity ghost that does not only inhabit her apartment but her very brain, tickling her wiring until she complies. Continue through the various folds and you will find yourself at what I found to be the essence of the story: a life worth living is rarely easy and in order to get there we must acknowledge the past, have the strength and courage to move forward from it and to remember the true friends that helped us along the way.At turns funny and touching, Lorna Graham\u2019s writing style is delicious and her descriptive skills (at one point she describes the streets of New York as a Narnian landscape) had me wishing I lived in such a magical city. The inclusion of Donald as a sort of ego-centric Jiminy Cricket served to not only keep Eve on her toes but gave her a friend in a lonely city and gave her a link to the life her mother had cherished. The behind the scenes look into the world of television news was a real eye opener for me and was a lively contrast to the Beat generation that Eve worked so hard to find. At times Eve seemed out of place in this modern world, more designed for the close knit artistic community of the 60s then the one she finds herself in, but for me this helped to highlight the difference between the New York Eve was expecting when she moved there (the one she idolized after listening to her mother\u2019s stories) and the reality she comes face to face with. It is Eve\u2019s journey from the idealistic to the realistic that truly showed her growth as a person.It definitely turns the traditional \u201csearch for self in the city that never sleeps\u201d story on its toes. I cannot wait to see what Lorna Graham brings next."}, {"userName": "Amanda", "userReviewDate": "Jul 07, 2011", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/887977-amanda", "userReview": "Eves mother died when she was 8, too young to have really known her. She had spent some of the happiest years of her life as part of the beat writers social circle in Greenwich village,NYC. In an attempt to find out more about her mothers life and to feel more connected to her Eve moves there and tries to get a New York city life started. She discovers her apartment is haunted by Donald Bellows a cranky beatnik writer who died before his promise was fulfilled and wants to dictate his unwritten masterpieces to Eve whether she wants to or not. In addition to dealing with this unwelcome house guest, Eve's time is spent trying to find traces of her mother's NY existence and learning the ropes of her new job as a writer for a morning television show. I found this an easy and enjoyable read. It was thankfully not as chicklitish as I had expected. There was quite some depth along with the lighthearted feel. At first I really didn't like the ghost at all. I wondered at his purpose and found him very irritating. Especially the fact that he is not a visual apparition, but an auditory one. I found the developing friendship between Eve and Krieg the elderly fashion designer much more intriguing. As the story developed my feelings towards Donald changed and he grew on me. It was easy to forget he was a ghost after a while and the way his storyline fitted in with the other aspects of Eve's life began to take shape and was resolved in a lovely way. I also enjoyed the morning television show storyline. The author writes about that world very well. I read in her bio that she used to work in that world. I wonder if she had some bad experiences there because she is not always complementary about it's people or practices. I wonder if Bliss, or Mark are based on real people. Ouch!
