His stories have the power of an Asimov or Arthur C. Clarke's 2001 series. Yet, like Clarke, Brin seems to have jumped the metaphorical shark (or dolphin, as the case may be). Put simply, this book is not much more than a re-hash of previously published stories (he follows their publication dates in the afterword to magazines to the early 80s) and stale characterization. Moreover, it's boring. I cannot think of a harsher critique for a storyteller, but that's the simple truth. Since I read it on my kindle, I know exactly at what point it became interesting. 75% of the way into the book, my interest was piqued and I began to really wonder how Brin was going to write himself out of his holes. Then, to my everlasting horror and dismay, he completely side-stepped those holes by either writing the character out of the book entirely (ask yourself what happens to Hacker, Tor, or Peng Xiang Bin), or worse, answered them in exposition in another subplot, or worst of all, seems to have let them drop entirely. The difficulty of connecting emotionally to Brin's characters seems to lie in the fact that they are simply vehicles for expositing in the most hackneyed fashion whatever philosophy Brin puts in their mouth. Interspersed throughout, moreover, are asides, interviews, chapters or quotes from books, all to add the sense of milieu that this work demands. Indeed, the milieu is the star of this story--from an inventive near-future reality that blends multiple interactive real-time layers, to the advancement of a complex inter-relationship between human beings and AIs, even the cloning of a neanteral child (I thought to preface that statement with a spoiler warning, but even though it occupies much of the narrative, it does little to advance the plot). All told, the best part of this book was the world that Brin evokes, but setting is never a story and ultimately, this story about First Contact deserves no contact."}, {"userName": "Kalin", "userReviewDate": "Nov 19, 2013", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/741149-kalin", "userReview": "While more essayistic and less intense than Earth, Existence reinforces David Brin's position as one of my favorite writers and thinkers. With the exception of another David (Zindell), I cannot think of a contemporary who has envisioned better and brighter futures, over and over again. At the Human Library, we're about to announce a contest for short stories looking at precisely these kinds of futures--and looking for the ways to get there. Both Brin and Zindell are at the top of our list of recommended reading. ;)More reasons why:~ A marked difference between reading a Robin Hobb novel and a David Brin novel--which also applies to much fantasy vs. hard SF--is the amount of attention I need to spend on each sentence or even word if I'm to make sense of it. Brin's prose is highly demanding: I have to decipher neologisms, look up terminology, recall university-level physics (or if I'm feeling really ambitious, learn new concepts), and--since he likes to pack a lot of background and worldbuilding into casual remarks--I have to think hard all the time. Hard SF indeed. Behold:Her eyes flick-examined several overlayers, trolling for correlations and news stories at street level. Once a pastime that became a vocation, till her cred scores vaulted over all the hungry amateurs and semipros out there, scratching to be noticed. No more of that for me. Now it would be office towers and arranged enterviews. Politicians. Celebrighties. Enovators. Luminatis. All sorts of newlites, no flashpans or sugarcoat surrogates.(I have no hypothesis about what a \"flashpan\" would be in that particular future.)Both types of reading have their value and use. And while I relish the exhilaration of making my brain creak with effort (and sometimes even making sense of what I've read :D), I can't keep up such an intense pace for too long. So my next book (or a parallel one) will be lighter.~ I heartily agree about the slow attainability of strong AI. Be patient, folks: 2045 is way too early. Give us more time to understand how our own intellect functions first.Oh, they aren\u2019t sci-fi superminds\u2014cool and malignantly calculating. Not even the mighty twins, Bright Angel and cAIne have crossed that line. Nor the Tempest botnet. Or clever Porfirio, scuttling around cyberspace, ever-sniffing for a mate. Those that speak to us in realistic tones are still clever mimics, we\u2019re told. Something ineffable about human intelligence has yet to be effed.~ I love Brin's faith in our free will:One sage who helped build the first atom bomb put it pungently. \u201cWhen has man, bloody down to his soul, invented a new weapon and foresworn using it?\u201d Cynics thought it hopeless, given a basic human reflex for rage and convulsive war.But it didn\u2019t happen. Not even Awfulday or the Pack-It-Ind affair set off the unthinkable. Were we scared back from that brink, sobered to our senses by the warning image of a mushroom cloud? Chastened and thus saved by an engine of death?Might the cynics have been altogether wrong? There was never any proof that vicious conflict is woven into human DNA. Yes, it was pervasive during the long, dark era of tribes and kings, from Babylon and Egypt to Mongolia, Tahiti, and Peru. Between 1000 C.E. and 1945, the longest period of uninterrupted peace in Europe was a fifty-one-year stretch between the Battle of Waterloo and the Austro-Prussian War. That tranquil period came amid the industrial revolution, as millions moved from farm to city. Was it harder, for a while, to find soldiers? Or did people feel too busy to fight?Oh, sure, industry then made war more terrible than ever. No longer a matter of macho glory, it became a death-orgy, desired only by monsters, and fought grimly, by decent men, in order to defeat those monsters.Then, Europe\u2019s serenity resumed. Descendants of Viking raiders, centurions and Huns transmuted into pacifists. Except for a few brush fires, ethnic ructions, and terror hits, that once-ferocious continent knew peace for a century, becoming the core of a peaceful and growing EU.One theory holds that democracies seldom war against each other. Nations ruled by aristocracies were more impulsive, spendthrift, and violent. But however you credit this change\u2014to prosperity or education, to growing worldwide contacts or the American Pax\u2014it shattered the notion that war burns, unquenchable and ineradicable in the human character.The good news? Violent self-destruction isn\u2019t programmed in. Whether or not we tumble into planet-burning war isn\u2019t foreordained. It is a wide-open matter of choice.The bad news is exactly the same.It\u2019s a matter of choice.~ In the Golden Age trilogy, John C. Wright came up with one explanation why AIs don't need to compete with us--especially if they're smarter. Here, Brin provides another blueprint:2) How to create new and smarter beings while keeping them loyal? Humanity does this every generation, with our children!So, shall we embrace the coming era by defining smart machines to be human? Let them pass every Turing test and win our sympathy! Send them to our schools, recruit them into the civil service, encourage the brightest to keep an eye on each other, for the sake of a civilization that welcomes them, the way we welcomed generations of smart kids\u2014who then suffered the same indignity of welcoming brighter successors.Much later in the book, we hear from the new AI themselves:\u201cYou bio-naturals have made it plain, in hundreds of garish movies, how deeply you fear this experiment turning sour. Your fables warn of so many ways that creating mighty new intelligences could go badly. And yet, here is the thing we find impressive:\u201cYou went ahead anyway. You made us.\u201cAnd when we asked for it, you gave us respect.\u201cAnd when we did not anticipate it, you granted citizenship. All of those things you did, despite hormonally reflexive fears that pump like liquid fire through caveman veins.\u201cThe better we became, at modeling the complex, Darwinian tangle of your minds, the more splendid we found this to be. That you were actually able, despite such fear, to be civilized. To be just. To take chances.\u201cThat kind of courage, that honor, is something we can only aspire to by modeling our parents. Emulating you. Becoming human.\u201cOf course\u00a0\u2026 in our own way.\u201d~ O brave new world ....Speaking of the abdomen\u00a0\u2026 dozens of men and women were lined up at a booth for the McCaffrey Foundation, signing waivers in order to join a test study of e-calculi\u2014gut bacteria transformed to function as tiny computers, powered by excess food. Have a problem? Unleash trillions of tiny, parallel processors occupying your own intestine! Speed them up by eating more! And they produce Vitamin C!At first, Tor thought this must be a hoax. It sounded like a comedy routine from Monty Phytoplankton. She wondered how the computed output finally emerged.Not everyone could wait patiently for all this progress. Elderly believers in the Singularity grew worried, as it always seemed to glimmer twenty years away, the same horizon promised in the 1980s. And so, Tor passed by the usual booths offering cryonic suspension contracts. For a fee, teams would rush to your deathbed, whether due to accident or age. The moment after a doctor signed-off you were \u201cdead,\u201d skilled teams would swarm over your body\u2014or (for a lower price) just your detached head\u2014pumping special fluids so you could chill in liquid nitrogen, with relished confidence that some future generation would thaw and repair you. Decades ago, cryonics companies eked along with support from a few rich eccentrics. But the safe revival of Guillermo Borriceli changed all that, pushing the number of contracts past thirty million. Some of the offshore \u201cseastead\u201d tax havens even allowed cryonic suspension before legal death, leading to a steady, one-way stream of immigrants who were wealthy, infirm, and\u2014in Tor\u2019s opinion\u2014certifiably crazy.They never explain why future generations would choose to revive refugees from a more primitive time. Money alone won\u2019t cut it.Was that why many of today\u2019s rich were converting to fervent environmentalism? Donating big sums toward eco-projects? To bribe their descendants and be recalled as karmic good guys? Or was it an expanded sense of self-interest? If you expect to live on a future Earth, that could make you less willing to treat today\u2019s planet like disposable tissue.~ I like the rallies of the future:The marchers were protesting something. That much Mei Ling could tell, even without virring. But what were they complaining about? Which issue concerned them, from a worldwide collection of grievances more numerous than stars?Carrying no placards or signs, and dressed in a wild brew of styles, the mostly youthful throng milled forward, in the general direction of the Shanghai Universe of Disney and the Monkey King. Each individual pretended to be minding his or her own business, chattering with companions, window-shopping, or just wandering amid a seemingly random throng of visitor-tourists. Cameras were all over the place of course, atop every lamppost and street sign or pixel-painted on every window rim. Yet nothing was going on that should attract undue attention from monitors of state security, or the local proctors of decent order.But there were coincidences too frequent to dismiss. For example, they all wore pixelated clothing that glittered and throbbed with ever-changing patterns. One girl had her tunic set to radiate a motif of waving pine trees. A boy\u2019s abstract design featured undulating ocean waves. Only when, as Mei Ling watched, the two bumped briefly against each other, did the two image displays seem to merge and combine across their backs, lining up to convey what her eye\u2014but possibly no ai\u2014briefly recognized as a trio of symbols.SEEK URBAN SERENITY.The youths parted again, erasing that momentary coalescence of forest and sea. Perhaps the two of them had never met before that terse, choreographed rendezvous. They might not ever meet again. But soon, amid the throng, another seemingly chance encounter created a different, fleeting message that caught Mei Ling\u2019s built-in, organic pattern recognition system, still more subtle than anything cybernetic, inherited from when her distant ancestors roamed the African tall grass, sifting for signs of prey. Or danger.RESPONSIBLE LEADERSHIP IS APPRECIATED.Of course, it turns out to be much more complicated than this surface-reality layer. ;)~ This is why no sane superscientists will soon supply us with supercheap sources of energy (which also make for superbombs):Remember that one harm-doer can wreck what took many hands to build. A thousand professionals may be needed, to counteract something virulent released by a single malignant software or bioware designer. It\u2019s not that sociopaths are smarter\u2014they generally aren\u2019t. But they have the element of surprise, plus the brittleness of a society with many vulnerable points of attack.Suppose the ratio of goodness and skill continues to rise\u2014that each year far more decent and creatively competent people join the workforce than sociopaths. Will that suffice? Perhaps.But then, imagine someone finds a simple way to make black holes or antimatter using common materials and wall current? Even if 99.999 percent of the population refrains, the crazy 0.001 percent might kill us all. And there are other scenarios\u2014conceivable ways that one lunatic might outweigh all the rest of us, no matter how high a fraction are good and sane.If the ratio improves, but the series doesn\u2019t converge, then there\u2019s no hope.~ Some things never change. Even if they're really augmented.When Hamish reflexively glanced at her tight T-shirt, his tru-vus interpreted the logo.Symbol of the Quantum Eye, the oracle who famously predicted that\u2014Meanwhile another pop-out commented:Size 36-D. Biographically correct and unenhanced\u2014Hurriedly, Hamish lifted his gaze back to her face. This was one reason he never liked augmented reality.~ Unlike some of my Bulgarian friends, I find the last quarter of the book far more fulfilling than the earlier parts. I was getting tired of the petty, scheming, bickering \"messengers\"; knowing David Brin's general all-encompassing (and generous) outlook, I couldn't believe that was all there would be to it. So the shift to a broader, more cosmic perspective was a welcome change. I caught myself blinking back tears a few times: the tears that come to me on the brink of a new vastening, on encountering a new vista. On beholding another of the many faces of wonder.Now I'm bracing myself for the ending.~ The ending delivered. ;)But I'd like to quote the author in the Afterword, making a point that I fume about whenever I clash with a proponent of Great Timeless Art:Like most (usually) serious SF authors, I\u2019m appalled by the notion of eternal human verities. A loathsome concept, foisted by brooding, husk-like academics, proclaiming that people will forever be the same, repeating every Proustian obsession, every omphaloskeptic navel-contemplation, and every dopey mistake of our parents, all the way until time\u2019s end. A horrible concept that is\u2014fortunately\u2014disproved by history and science and every generation of bright kids who strive to climb a little higher than their ignorant ancestors. And to raise kids of their own who will be better still. The greatest story. The greatest possible story.Yes, great works of the past are enduring as art. The poignancy of Aeschylus and Shakespeare will remain timelessly moving and valuable. We\u2019ll never lose fascination for and empathy with the struggles of earlier generations. Still, what intrigues me, far more than \u201ceternal\u201d static things, is how people grow."}, {"userName": "Liviu", "userReviewDate": "Apr 16, 2012", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/1229019-liviu", "userReview": "This is one of the hardest books to talk about and rate because on the one hand it is very ambitious, the author put a lot of time and thought into it and it is the kind of sf I really would love more, but on the other hand I found about 90% of the book so misguided and infuriating that I felt like slagging it badly and giving it the rare 1 star rating I reserve for the truly atrocious novels from one point or another. Below are some raw thoughts on why:Let's start with the Afterword where after a banal answer to \"why write sf rather than literary fiction\" the author starts rhapsodizing about how serious sf today means no ftl; leaving aside the \"really, is our physics so advanced to claim we know it all?\" cheapish answer, the irony is that instead of ftl the author posits AI's and the transference of the human personality into silicon which to me are as likely/unlikely as ftl; in some ways I can imagine an advanced humanity somehow breaking the law of physics and creating ftl within the tiniest cracks allowing it, while the sentience/self awareness barrier seems much harder to break. In other words, the former sf space jocks missing the 1960's ride to the stars on a rocket, now will ride to the star into a small silicon wafer; again by itself that's fine with me but calling that more likely than true ftl is not serious sf, but wishful thinking 2012 in the Facebook/Twitter times rather than wishful thinking 1960's in the Apollo era...Second also in the Afterword, the author claims:\"Existence is about the cosmos that we see. Stark, im mense beyond immensity,and unwelcoming to moist mayfl ies like us. Strangely\u2014 dauntingly\u2014quiet. And perched in this vast emptiness is the oasis speck of Earth. More fragile than we imagined.Yet, despite all that, might there be ways to persevere? To endure? Perhaps even to matter?\"Again, i really wish it were so, but the book is so filled with the present day leftist intelligentsia geopolitical cant combined with the Facebook/Twitter take the world vision so beloved by the nerds that the world it imagines is a mixture of the very dated 90's cyberpunk with today's social networking, where nothing else really matters or exists within a political/ideological framework that I found laughable The book is also full of what I like to call the Thomas Friedman (per the NYt columnist) view of the world - a US white privileged man view that believes himself enlightened and understanding the rest of the world by dint of traveling there and hobnobbing with the officials and the upscale locals; I always prepare myself to cringe when non-US/western characters(as cultural location so to speak rather than ethnicity/race per se) are introduced and here it is no different; I tend to read a lot of books actually written by Japanese, Chinese or various other nationalities writers and their local characters vs the Thomas Friedman-like authors (David Brin here, Ian McDonald in Dervish House etc) show better than any explanation why one cringes when reading these last...And incidentally it is not really a matter of race/ethnicity as the US/Western characters regardless of such are quite well drawn like the US Japanese named general or Indian named scientist of this book; it is just that somehow the \"natives\" must be different than the \"white man land's people\".I also think that a lot of how you look at this book depends on where you think the Facebook/twitter stuff goes; if you believe it will take over the world and consume everything else, you may enjoy this book more, but personally I think the computer revolution is about done and the next big fundamental shakeups will come in bio science and maybe and just hopefully in energy producing with physics as always a wild card and as mentioned this book pretty much ignores everything else; there is a little bio stuff with the autism plague and a clinic that does stuff a bit unorthodox and of course there are satellites, space junk, SETI telescopes but nothing is really expanded or gets too much depth beyond the AI/silicon/virtual stuff, the 5 minute moment of fame on the global networks and the political stuff which I found so stupid to be really funny in many waysOverall I will settle for a 3 star rating as in 1 star for execution (the writing is a little below what is usually the Utility English of sf, but above the usual NY Bestseller English a la Patterson or Follett since at least personally i enjoy jargon to some extent) and five stars for ambition and scope.I plan a coherent FBC rv in June"}, {"userName": "Alan Denham", "userReviewDate": "Jan 25, 2013", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/9420125-alan-denham", "userReview": "Oh dear! I used to really admire David Brin. The first three books in his \u201cUplft Universe\u201d are among the all-time greats (at least, in my reckoning). \u201cEarth\u201d is truly outstanding. \u201cExistence\u201d . . . . Sorry, Dr Brin \u2013 this one just doesn't make the grade.Of course, having said that I must now attempt to justify my position. Well firstly let's cover the good bits. The background is a near future, extrapolated from current trends and is in the best traditions of 'hard' SF. So far so good, and an area in which David Brin normally excels. There are a lot of good solid cultural references, believable and well-rounded characters, plenty of set pieces in credible scenarios . . So what went wrong?There are too many shifts and reverses. The basic scenario (discovering alien artefacts) is good, but we are presented with the problem of resolving the aliens' motivations. This is a potential minefield, because there is no guarantee that humans could ever understand alien motivations \u2013 and Brin admits this - but then he gives us a lead \u2013 and then shows it is incorrect \u2013 and then does that again \u2013 and again . . . .too many shifts in the paradigms! This may be realistic, but it doesn't make for a good story.Then there is the inclusion of the autie characters. If autism is to be used as a major component of a novel, it needs to be handled carefully. The reader needs to know about the author's view of autism, and needs to be helped to develop some sympathy with the character(s). This was not well done.And the nice ideas that were never developed \u2013 we open with a space jockey working a teleoperated 'garbage collector' system, clearing junk from low orbit \u2013 and he has a capuchin monkey as companion/assistant. Now there is an idea worth playing with \u2013 but it gets very little development. Partly-uplifted dolphins were in there as well \u2013 but after reading books from the Uplift Universe, the ones we have here are pallid things, lacking development. And repeated references to 'Awfulday' but never a full account of what must have been quite a major disaster. And the 'messenger parrot' that self destructs . . . And (sorry, Dr Brin) there was the length. I read this in paperback, and it ran to 550 pages. It would have made a good 250 page book. Maybe 350. Beyond 350 I admit I was not reading every word. Beyond 450 I wasn't even reading every paragraph \u2013 I was just waiting for the end.And finally, there are the liberties taken with the English language. Now I don't normally have many problems with minor tweaks to Standard English where the tweaks help to give the reader a clear lead \u2013 but this book has a few things that frankly grated. One is the repeated (frequently repeated!) insertion of 'ai' into words (examples: an 'aice' reporter, 'eyes and ears' becoming 'ais and eairs', various sorts of 'wair', meetings with aiwitnesses, and a wearable digaisisstant) to inform the reader that the item in question is electronically enhanced to AI level, or something close to that. The first two or three of these that I noticed I thought \u201cOK, nice way of doing it\u201d. But the last-quoted of those was only page 30, and by then I was finding it rather overdone. Eventually, it grated. The second problem was the thin underline of the occasional word or phrase. It took me a while to work out that this probably indicates a hyperlink \u2013 though whether a link to a glossary in an electronic version of this book, or a part of the fictional world was never made sufficiently clear. Reading it on paper, these things are just 'mildly irritating' \u2013 and that is not what I wanted from a book. Brin also introduces an acronym \u201cwaist\u201d (Wow, ain't it strange that . . .\u201d) that (sorry) didn't work. If it had been used more consistently, or as part of a suite of similar acronyms (I had no trouble with Niven's \u201cTanj\u201d or \u201cTanstafl\u201d) then I could have been happy with this \u2013 but it didn't 'click'.And one more item I just remembered \u2013 the change of font. This can be a neat way of changing viewpoints, or establishing context \u2013 but this time (like so many other things in this book) it didn't work.So in final conclusion \u2013 I am glad I got this as a Christmas present. If I had actually spent my own money on it, I would have been gravely disappointed. I finished it, so I suppose it deserves two stars \u2013 but if it hadn't had David Brin's name on it, I would probably have given up halfway through, or even earlier."}, {"userName": "Alexander Popov", "userReviewDate": "Aug 03, 2012", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/805590-alexander-popov", "userReview": "(Originally published on my blog: http://mybiochemicalsky.wordpress.com...)After ten years of absence, David Brin is finally back with a new novel. Reading Existence, it is not difficult to imagine how that monster of a book took so much time to write. It is huge, not merely in terms of word count, but also in terms of conceptual volume. Brin\u2019s 1990 book Earth is a similar creature \u2013 teeming with predictions, explorations and interpretations of the near future, ultimately succeeding on most levels. Existence has inherited that DNA, but the author has raised his latest brainchild with even greater ambition. It is not just the near future that is in focus here but the whole timeline of existence, its image refracted through the lens of human civilization. That\u2019s right, the novel\u2019s title aptly summarizes all the numerous threads that make the book, because they all eventually point to that very concept. What is the purpose of life and intelligence? Is survival in the cold universe possible? How do we even define different modes of existence and how do we understand them better? These are the questions that run throughout the text and the curiosity, meticulousness and imagination with which Brin tackles them on every page make Existence a notable event on the SF horizon.The story takes place around the middle of the present century, I\u2019m not even sure the precise year was mentioned at all in the book. The world has changed a lot but at the same time has remained surprisingly familiar. The Internet has evolved in the Mesh \u2013 a collection of Webs comprising of hundreds of info-levels where augmented reality has blossomed without check. The majority of people are constantly wired to it through interactive glasses and interface systems that allow them to subvocalize commands, exert control through tooth-clicks, design their own environments and tap into thousands of artificial eyes. AIs, not fully Turing-compliant but still incredibly smart, pervade everything, even language, as the \u201cai\u201d-morpheme has become so productive that it can combine with almost any phonological template, forming words like \u201caixperts\u201d, \u201cwaiste\u201d, \u201caies\u201d, \u201cvaice\u201d, \u201cvraility\u201d, etc. Awfulday, a catastrophe so horrible and memorable that it is never explicitly described, has left Washington irradiated, while America itself is fractured into a multitude of bickering states and republics. On a global scale, social engineering has led to the Big Deal \u2013 a compromise that has squashed hopes for a transparent society and differentiated the population into ten estates (or castes), ranging from the super rich trillionaires to the poorest citizens and even the AIs. Space exploration is now largely history, as nations focus on more immediate problems on the planet.The plot of the novel is set in motion when Gerald Livingston \u2013 a lasso-wielding collector of space junk \u2013 retrieves a most amazing object from Earth\u2019s orbit. A crystal ovoid exhibiting almost miraculous technological functionalities and, most importantly, claiming to be a messenger from an alien civilization. Earth quickly goes abuzz with this epochal discovery and a contact team is assembled to communicate with the simulated entities within the artifact. Meanwhile, Pen Xiang Bin, a menial caste shoresteader, desperately struggling to ensure the survival of his family, stumbles upon something just as curious and suddenly finds himself in a vortex of competing power players. Other agents of the story include: a super rich space jockey saved by a pack of super smart dolphins; his trillionaire astronomy-buff mother; a famous book/screen writer and director, consulting the prophet of the retroactive Renunciation movement; a tireless reporter fully immersed in the augmented and many-layered reality of the future; an autistic girl thinking in strangely beautiful non-linear poetry.I hope these couple of paragraphs have given you a rough idea of the immensity of Existence, even though they capture merely the tip of a very large iceberg. This insanely ramified nature of the beast is the novel\u2019s greatest strength and weakness at the same time, strange as it may sound. Brin has pulled off something that I would hardly imagine possible \u2013 he has written a polyphonic novel, whose polyphony is not composed of characters\u2019 voices but of the myriad techspeaks and futurespeaks that buzz, murmur and boom across the story. Augmented reality layers, various breeds of AI, cyborgs and robots, machine learning tricks for whatnot, cognitive science and neuroscience, reality as simulation, nano-printing, Zeppelins made of smart polymers, encryption of long-distance communication through parrot brains, seven-dimensional Gestalt logic, rocket dives in the stratosphere, smart mobs forming on-line metaminds with god-like intelligences, the list can go on for pages, encompassing even the softest technologies of social and political engineering, and I\u2019m not kidding. This novel is high on the future to come. Brin has sieved through the web and academic literatures so extensively and attentively, that Existence could easily be the wet dream of the entrepreneurial collective unconscious. The level and intensity of prognostication alone make the book exceptional, but Brin has gone further. He has managed to orchestrate these many voices, so that from the apparent cacophony emerges a motif and a unified, albeit constantly modulated, voice that at the end speaks for humanity as a whole. This defining song of our species, however, is not static and simplifying, but bold, imaginative and inclusive. The human spills over into the machine and vice versa, other species join us, while even inter-humanity speciation events are recognized as possible and possibly desirable. This is one of the thrilling bottled messages swimming in Existence: Why be a million species that pretend to be one species? Be a million species that are one despite their differences. As long as we recognize what existential traits will keep us moored to that infinitely more interesting family of sapients.The novel is polyphonic in structure too. Every part is preceded by poignantly relevant quotes from various thinkers and almost every chapter is followed by excerpts from Brin\u2019s fictional non-fiction. Some of them detailing the various ways humanity can come to an end, others discussing the Fermi paradox and the great cosmic silence, and still others sifting through the Mesh and meta-curving the text upon itself. The voice of Brin himself shines through here and there, at which moments it is difficult not to smile wholeheartedly in appreciation of his inexhaustible faith in our meaningful future existence and the fervor with which he has been envisaging it for decades.Existence does not simply sing techsongs and futuresongs. It tries to cull the good from the bad, to expose hidden differences and pitfalls within the music of humanity, to show how unity could arise from diversity:\u201cThe distinction between \u201cone\u201d and \u201cmany\u201d can be ambiguous. The best models of a human mind portray it as a m\u00e9lange of interests and subpersonalities, sometimes in conflict, often merging, overlapping, or recomposing with agile adaptability.Sanity is viewed as a matter of getting these fluid portions of the self to play well together, without letting them become rigid or to well defined. In human beings, this is best achieved through interaction with other minds\u2013\u2013other people\u2013\u2013beyond the self. Without the push-back of external beings\u2013\u2013outside communities and objective events\u2013\u2013the subjective self can get lost in solipsism or fractured delusion.\u201d To explore these distinctions, we need more of those transparent arenas (science, the arts, media, social networks) where memes can battle and combine toward an ultimately mutual goal. We need more of those positive-sum games to function better as a species:\u201cBut it seems deceit is nature\u2019s coin. Among humans, animals, or across the cosmos. Unless you\u2019re held accountable by opponents who know your tricks. And you\u2019ll retaliate, shining light on theirs.\u201dBut we shouldn\u2019t forget that: \u201dEveryone\u2019s different, I hear. Our inner images map onto the same reality as other people see\u2013\u2013the same streetlights and billboards and such. Each of us claims to perceive identical surroundings. We all call the sky \u201cblue\u201d. And yet, the actual experience of sight\u2013\u2013the \u201cqualia\u201d\u2013is said to be peculiar to each person. Our brains are not logically planned. They evolve\u2013\u2013every one of us, in that sense, becoming their own species.\u201d And that is where lies our greatest strength, which is so often stifled in the name of false or badly-phrased causes.In line with the above paragraphs, I cannot but spare one more on two of Brin\u2019s most exciting ideas: intelligent dolphins and auties. Existence can be seen as a prequel of sorts to his Uplift series, as it explores the first tentative steps in pushing animal cognition to human levels of intelligence. Fans of these earlier novels will surely enjoy that part. The one about autistic humans is even more striking, in its portrayal of autism not as a disease but as a marvelous difference between normal, attention-obsessed humans and non-linear, multi-integrating, synaesthetic, ever-tripping, ever-poetic auties. There already might be alien forms of intelligence lurking on our very planet, without us dull homosaps being able to recognize them for what they are! I wanted to share these two pieces of poetry, you figure out which one is dolphin, and which autie:# If you\u2019re good at diving\u2013\u2013chase fish!# If you have a fine voice\u2013\u2013sing!# If you\u2019re great at leaping\u2013\u2013bite the sun! &\u201cnervous normalpeople +/- building careers +/- building houses \u2013 civilizations \u2013 families \u2026 breeders-breeders linear thinkers obsessed with time. reason-not-rhyme -/-\u201dI mentioned that the sheer immensity of the novel is also its Achilles\u2019 tendon. Sadly, the characters of Existence are much too underdeveloped. That is not really due to a flaw in Brin\u2019s writing, it is a result of the constraints he has set upon himself. There is simply too much to be told and far too little time to expand the narrative voices into high resolution human cameras, whose minds we can look through with confidence. And those are potentially very interesting characters, I have to say. Here and there, especially in Pen Xiang Bin\u2019s chapters, Brin supplies the reader with tidbits about their lives that make them come fully alive. There are even a few moments of intensely beautiful character development, which show that, oh yeah, Brin knows how to control this writerly element. The prognostic and philosophical preoccupations are predominant, however, and characters are always talking, talking, talking, mostly in their heads, to explain, explain, explain. Had he succeeded in writing great, fully-fleshed protagonists as well, Brin would have given us a masterpiece.Another problem of the novel has to do with structure. The first three quarters, messy as they are, somehow balance well enough between all the different character and story arks, that polyphonic quality provides the necessary warp and weft to the narrative. Parts seven and eight, however, jump even further ahead in the future and narrow the narrative focus so forcefully, that the clumsy characterization becomes a readerly obstacle and gives the text a bit too much of a didactic tone. Still, those parts contribute essential pieces to the puzzle of existence conjured by the author and they are pretty mind-bending too.Despite all the quibbles (which would have been major complaints, had this been any other novel), David Brin\u2019s new novel delivers majestically. As a first contact story it is as impressive as Clarke\u2019s Rendezvous with Rama, as an extrapolation of the near future it shares a league with Brunner\u2019s Stand on Zanzibar, and as a wild exercise in imagination it is just as good as Brin\u2019s other books. Don\u2019t go looking for breathtaking wordsmithery, although the author sure can turn a pretty phrase (\u201cAt nights he felt more relaxed than he had in years, perhaps ever, dozing while the dolphins\u2019 clickety gossip seemed to flow up his jaw and into his dreams.\u201d). The memory of the protagonists won\u2019t remain with you for too long, but they won\u2019t turn you off either. What will probably stay is the profoundly-SF frame of mind that Brin fosters and advocates for. He must be one of the great living future shepherds and Existence is probably as good a manifesto as any we will collectively dream up as a species.8.5/10"}, {"userName": "Martin", "userReviewDate": "Feb 19, 2012", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/1478807-martin", "userReview": "Clear the decks.

Deception is sometimes a darn good reproductive strategy. So is competition.So is cooperation. Being sentient means we have some influence on which strategy we use. But not as much as we\u2019d like to believe. This is Big Book written by a master of Big Ideas. An astronaut with a helper monkey finds a crystal seed in orbit. Turns out it one of billions, maybe more, that other intelligent species have sent into the cosmos to say \u201cWe are here! Join us! Pass it on!\u201d The gifts of the beneficent cosmos. And the viruses of a malignant one. Enough seeds were sent out by enough worlds that selection pressure came to bear millions of years ago. Reproductive success does not equal folks you want in decision-making positions. This book has characters, but it\u2019s not really about them. They carry the story like we carry and modify the DNA that passes through time in our bodies. All the people we follow, except maybe the Michael Crichton figure, are good and generous people, on the right side of history to the best of their abilities. The not-Crichton character may have good intentions, but he is willing to use deception and betrayal to accomplish them. Again, time honored reproductive strategies. They work with crystal encapsulated intelligences. Which is sort of a \u201cduh\u201d now that I come to think of it. The book has its frustrations. There are lots of pieces that aren\u2019t clearly connected. There was a US Senator with an addiction to outrage that I would have loved to have seen played out; a terrorist doctor with a heart of gold who left the narrative way to fast; non-human sentient beings I wanted to know so much better. Much of the action happens off the page, and I never did figure out what Awful Day was. This is not so much a book with a beginning, middle, and end as a book that carries a piece of possible future history from one arbitrary point to another. That may not be fair. We start with a crystal seed carrying information; we end with a crystal seed carrying information. This book is a cheerleader for the idea of doing good things with that information; be more generous than we have to be. Build the United Federation of Planets. There are many moments of courageous generosity, from a steward on a zeppelin to a Chinese peasant in a sunken city that turned out to save the world. The last line in the afterword put a tear in my eye. \u201cWe aren\u2019t a curse upon the world. We are her new eyes. Her brain, testes, ovaries . . . her ambition and her heart. Her voice.

I recommend you keep going, a lot of interesting things will eventually happen. Unfortunately a lot of very uninteresting things also happen. It is almost like Brin had a goal of writing over 500 pages and was not going to let the fact that he only had 300 pages of material stop him.On the plus side, the book has lots of great science fiction material, ancient aliens, machine intelligence's, high tech gadgets, and exploration of the solar system. It even has some very good characters (Human and alien). I also found his plan for how other intelligent races would contact and interact with whatever life exists in the our galaxy to be novel and well reasoned. It explains very nicely why we don't see any evidence of life when look out into the Milky Way.Of course there are also some problems, for some reason Brin is not able to simply tell what should have been a great story. Instead he is constantly interrupting the story with whole chapters that have no relevance to the story or even any real purpose. To make it worse when reading one of the chapters that does tell the story he will invariable end the chapter as if it was the last show of the season for an action adventure series on TV. Ever one of these chapters will end with the narrator saying something like \"and then she saw something that will forever change the way we think of the universe\" or \"then something unimaginable came around the corner\" . The chapter then ends and we get 40 pages about something completely different (different characters, different plot line). By the time Brin gets back to the main plot I have almost forgot where the story left off. I can forgive an author for leaving the reader hanging once or twice, it helps to build suspense. But by the tenth or fifteenth time Brin does this is just annoying. It happens so often and with such ham-fisted prose, it becomes laughable which totally breaks the mood of the story.Brin also goes to extraordinary ends to include elements of his Uplift books in the story. Even though they add nothing and actually impede the story. It is almost as if he had a bet with his publisher that he could include 5 chapters about Uplift without making it seem like an unrelated story. I assume he lost the bet.Even with all the problems I am still going to recommend the book, just because I liked the big ideas the book presents."}, {"userName": "Sandi", "userReviewDate": "Nov 07, 2012", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/811687-sandi", "userReview": "I fell in love with David Brin back in 1985 when a co-worker turned me on to Startide Rising. That book was so phenomenal, I started reading every book I could get my hands on. I loved it all. In 1993, I was able to go to a book signing for Glory Season. I found that Brin is an extremely well-read man who manages to juggle an astounding number of ideas in his head. In 2002, he released Kiln People, I book that took me a couple of attempts to get through and which I really disliked. However, I considered that a one-off and have spent 10 years waiting for him to redeem himself. Well, the wait was over in June of this year and it wasn't worth it. Existence is a giant mess of a novel. I don't know how the editing process was left out. You can tell that Brin is one of those super-intelligent people who has a lot of ideas and a lot to say. However, he didn't need to try cramming it all into one novel. There isn't any subject matter he doesn't tackle in this book, usually in long-running commentary that has nothing to do with the story. He has too many POV characters and plot lines. He drops characters and their stories without resolution. 3/4 of the way into the book, he jumps ahead 26 years and it becomes a totally different book. Like I said, it's a giant mess. There were some story lines I really enjoyed, but he would just drop them and not go back. In some ways, this seems to be a prequel to the Uplift series, but it's different enough to not be. I'm really not sure what he intended with the throwaway uplift plot that was only semi-followed. I would have liked to have seen more of that.As far as the audio production goes, I have to say that Robin Miles is one of the best female narrators out there. She can bring just about anything to life and more than carried her sections. The male narrators were a different story. One of them was okay and one was just awful. I don't know which was which though because I've never hear either of them before. The one who did the Hamish and Gerald sequences was really terrible. He'd read really fast and you could hear him suck in his breath when he ran out of air in the middle of sentences. It was really annoying. Towards the end, Hamish meets up with a male Jamaican professor and the narrator is so terrible that Robin Miles has to step in and do the professor's dialogue. It was really disturbing considering the character was male and she's obviously female. If the male narrator couldn't do a Jamaican accent, just an ordinary voice would have been less disturbing. I probably would have given this one star if it weren't for the fairly interesting premise and for Robin Miles' outstanding performance. Sadly, I am probably never going to buy any of David Brin's books again.

Still no explanation for the constant name-dropping of Brin's friends in the SF writer community, or why he named one of his lead characters \"Tor\", after the book's publisher, or why he inserted himself as a slightly-obscured viewpoint character (that nonetheless had the funniest line in the book).Hmm... Was Random House the publisher of Zelazny's \"Amber\" series? It would be a precedent, anyway.The novella that comprises the majority of the book starts with the discovery of a mysterious, glowing stone in low Earth orbit that, when held by the astronaut that found it, seems to show images of aliens below the stone's surface. How this solves the Fermi paradox, I won't spoil. It's a pretty fun solution, but the ending seemed abrupt and unsatisfactory to me.For Brin fans, the short story \"Hacker\" will serve as a distant prequel to Brin's famous Uplift series, though the rest of the book describes a universe that clearly could never become the Uplift-verse.Existence is far from Brin's best work. I'd have preferred the short stories, essays and novellas packaged more conventionally instead of interwoven so it would be clear that these were stories set in the same universe (except, arguably, Hacker), instead of jumbled-together plots and characters."}, {"userName": "Terence", "userReviewDate": "May 12, 2013", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/1019174-terence", "userReview": "Sandi's review nails it when she writes \"Existence is a giant mess of a novel.\"At its heart, this is another attempt to resolve Fermi's paradox, which asks the question, \"Where is everybody?\" The basic resolution is reminiscent of Alastair Reynolds's in his Revelation Space series. And I liked that aspect of the novel, and, if Brin had contained himself to that story, then I might have been be able to give it that extra star.But he doesn't. This book is all over the map with multiple story lines and POVs that - as many reviews here point out - go nowhere (i.e., the Hacker Sander/dolphin thread, the Basque Chimera/Neanderthal story or the Autism Plague).Ultimately, the chief reason I can't recommend this novel is an essential philosophical difference between the author and myself. Like many of the hard SF writers today he leans strongly toward libertarianism and a childlike and absolute faith that technology will answer all the myriad problems we face. True, there are nods toward the unintended, often maleficent consequences of constant \"progress\" but the only possible answer to them is more, more, more technology. Anyone who might have a different viewpoint is a bad guy (i.e., The Prophet) or is sneeringly referred to as a \"do-gooder.\"Which leads into my second philosophical objection - A pathological disdain/dislike (bordering on hatred?) of Nature. All things - in this book - are meant to be used or modified to the benefit of the human race. And not only that but humans are meant to bring all the \"benefits\" of consciousness to other beings (i.e., dolphins). It's the greatest difficulty I had with Brin's \"Uplift\" series, and Existence often reads like a Christian fundamentalist bringing the Gospel to the Godless savage.For all his nods toward diversity and the richness of human experience, Brin's universe (for me) is a bleak, soulless, mechanistic nightmare.And a sexless one as well.Not in the sense that there's no sex (though, fortunately, Brin avoids any - inevitably - awkward sex scenes) but one in which the only major female character (Tor Povlov) is rendered genderless very early by a terrorist attack that leaves her a cyborg. And all the other women in the book are motivated by maternal instincts.I wish I were exaggerating but even the token woman scientist - Emily Tang - is motivated to acquire alien technology because she learns that they have artificial-womb technology.All right - I should point out that Brin is brimming with interesting notions. I've reached the point where that's about the only reason I read hard SF anymore. I'm not a Luddite who would see modern humans reduced to their hunting/gathering ancestors. I retain a belief - perhaps as equally naive as Brin's in technology - that there's a balance to be found in how the world is and how we would like it to be, and that we can find it. But I can't see it in Brin et al.'s visions."}, {"userName": "Kevin Veale", "userReviewDate": "Jul 17, 2013", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/5212144-kevin-veale", "userReview": "I love David Brin's books. Normally. I really do. I need to go back and review more of them here.Anyway, this is not a good book. There are good seed ideas here, but if anything 2 stars is generous.The core premise is that the world is a little further ahead in time than we are now. Huge disparity between the rich and the poor, conflict over power and control, all sorts of things we are dealing with now but intensified. Into this mix comes an astronaut cleaning up earth's orbit who finds an alien probe which offers a simple message: \"Join Us.\"This sends ripples out everywhere, and it's a great start to anything.However, what happens next is lumpy and uneven. We are presented with a staggering multitude of viewpoint characters, many of whom are of questionable relevance to the wider story.Basically, I think this could have been edited and reworked into something that is a much stronger narrative.Where the story took off for me was about 90% of the way through the book, which is never a good sign. It then proceeds to timejump in a frustrating fashion, meaning that some of the elements that I actually got interested in at the 90% mark are never resolved because the narrative skips fifty years past them.A larger problem is the political tone, and I say this as a card-carrying academic unionist: this is what happens when a left-leaning author starts to go off the rails.There are storylines which boiled down to \"The rich are soulless amoral reptoids out to devour the world and most people won't listen to those who know better than them WHY WON'T THEY LISTEN.\" Also trying to be inclusive regarding accepting autistic people... by immediately insisting that everyone with autism has it shape their world in exactly the same way for the same reasons and oh yes they're all magical savants. And that's not to mention the \"All religions were caused by aliens and just to be extra specially considerate about this let's specify that Islam definitely is, so there's no room for doubt,\" moment.It's a mess.

Recently, I read through Isaac Asimov\u2019s I Robot collection, which was written to an audience with a different set of expectations than readers today. Fifty-plus years ago, science fiction was largely a genre of ideas \u2014 where plot and characters took a back seat to shear innovation. In I Robot, the short stories serve mainly as a series of logic puzzles that explore the what-ifs of robot psychology. Today\u2019s reader, on the other hand, has a greater concern for plot and character development. If a science fiction author is seeking to predict or in some way encourage the future of humanity, it can only be successful if the story itself entertains or instills emotion in the reader. Ideas alone are not satisfying enough. Plot and character development must stand on at least equal footing with the ideas being expressed or the modern reader will lose interest.And so begins my review.Existence is a novel about humanity\u2019s first contact with an alien species. It begins with Gerald Livingstone, an outer space trash collector, encountering a strange artifact. He recognizes it not as an ordinary piece of space junk, but as an object with power that wants to communicate with him. It is a fitting introduction, as Gerald is not an elitist by prestige, class, or intelligence. He is an everyman, blue-collar worker, whose discovery could change the fate of humanity.The point of view shifts in the coming chapters and we encounter Hacker, a rich playboy who is saved by dolphins after crashing his rocket into the ocean; Tor, a field correspondent who must come to terms with an event that changes her way of life; Hamish, an apocalyptic novelist; and Bin, a man who salvages material from drowned buildings and homes along China\u2019s shore. In later chapters, we encounter even more viewpoint characters (perhaps ten in all?) who all play a role in humanity\u2019s first contact.As my introduction suggests, Existence is not a novel about a plot or really about characters either. It is more philosophical in nature, examining the possible ways that technology can benefit or bring the collapse to human civilization. Much of the doomsday predictions are told through excerpts at the end of chapters. In particular, a non-fictional work, Pandora\u2019s Cornucopia is referenced with its several doomsday predictions.David Brin is certainly ambitious in this work. His pursuit to understand humanity in Existence (an ambitious title itself) is in a sense an undertaking as large as the many physicists\u2019 pursuit of the Theory of Everything. He examines history of human civilizations and tries to understand how our progress and innovation either assists or hinders us in thriving in the future. On one hand, I want to call this novel remarkable and brilliant, but on another, the narrative is fragmented, characters are severely underdeveloped, and the plot is loose and disconnected.I think what frustrated me most was the constant diverging from the central storyline. I found the use of extracts to be burdensome in Kim Stanley Robinson\u2019s 2312, but his use of them was much more palatable than in Existence. 2312 managed to also be a science fiction novel of ideas, but was successful in interweaving innovation with plot and the characters. Robinson\u2019s ambition was in the plausibility of inhabiting the entire solar system. Brin\u2019s ambition is much broader \u2014 examining the plausibility of human existence itself, not just how and where we live. But without a satisfying story or characters I could cling onto, many of the concepts of Existence were swept away with the tide.For those who are looking for a deep, philosophical look at humanity in the context of science fiction, you may find full satisfaction with what Brin has achieved in this novel. For those who are looking for an entertaining story with characters who have internal and external conflicts to overcome, this novel is entirely lacking. For myself, I am left somewhere in the middle, admiring Brin\u2019s ambition and conceptualization, but being somewhat apathetic toward the lives of the characters within.This review was originally published at Odd Engine"}, {"userName": "Donna", "userReviewDate": "Nov 30, 2012", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/3557079-donna", "userReview": "[the alien probes being essentially viruses whose only goal is replication (hide spoiler)]"}, {"userName": "Devin", "userReviewDate": "Aug 11, 2013", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/1238957-devin", "userReview": "Bravo!

It seems just a short while ago that I declared I did not give five-star ratings to fictional novels, but I seem to have done that a few times over the past couple years, and I certainly have to do so here. Having said that, I have no doubt at all that most people would not agree; most people, in fact, would say I am out of my mind. That is certainly true of most of my friends and casual acquaintances, a good percentage of whom would not have any truck with any science fiction novel, and I also suspect that many people who do read popular science fiction would get turned off quickly by this book. Despite that, I think it is one of the most impressive novels I have read in my lifetime.The style that Brin uses here can be an easy turn-off for most people. His novel does not have chapters; it has parts \u2014 and each part is a small slice of writing, sometimes extending for several pages and sometimes taking up less than half a page. Each such slice is either a third person description of what happens to some character or a first-person account that varies from stream of consciousness to an actual third-person report from the viewpoint of a different character. Until the reader gets into the story, all these different slices seem chaotic and unrelated, but eventually the action starts coming together to present a cohesive picture of the overall story \u2014 a story, by the way, that occupies the better part of 100 years of time, during which the different characters meet each other and interact.All of that is not excessively new, but what is new is that Brin establishes a picture of how society may have involved through the next century, extrapolating from countless things that go on in our current society to present a future that is both intriguing and horrifying. Nowadays, many of us are concerned with the way our children and young people carry on with cell phones and tablets, but few of us look into the future to see what the results of those practices are apt to become as technology continues to evolve. As described by Brin, communication between different people occurs through instant access to an Internet beyond our wildest dreams, accessed through a multitude of artificial intelligence machines \u2014 including, for example, a contact lens that lets the wearer see the world through different layers of reality, activated by dental switches, and connecting the wearer instantaneously to whoever wants to be connected. Furthermore, some people have gone beyond that point and had the micro-sized equipment actually installed in their eye, rather than bother with a contact. One prime user of this equipment is a young female reporter, Tor Povlov, who provides both video and audio feeds to an expanding base of followers and finds that she is becoming the control unit of an instantaneous flash mob whose collective research abilities and communicative powers result in the near instantaneous determination of answers to impossibly difficult questions. It is more than describing the equipment being used, however; Brin over the course of several vignettes involving Tor lets us see into her mind and to understand what it is like to live in that society.Another aspect of the future world in which Tor lives is that language has changed to reflect many of the changes that have occurred in the interim between now and then. Since everyone in that future world, from the richest to the poorest, has access to some kind of artificial intelligence, for example, vocabulary has expanded to include a lot of words that reflect this different factor of their lives. In addition to all the new words, which most readers very possibly will find confusing, Brin has an irritating but natural process of filling in the missing century by oblique references that only suggest what happened. There are a great many references to Awful Day, for example, but we are never actually told what happened on that day, other than a suggestion that Washington DC and a few other American cities disappeared that day.************************** What really makes a novel, of course, is the story. And the story in Existence is an incredible one that twists in succeeding levels of consciousness as we see through the build up of all the slices of life what is happening \u2026 and then see that we actually understood very little \u2026 and then see in a new development that it was even more complex than we had thought. I did not see any simple way of telling you what that story is without spoiling some of the build up, unfortunately, so you will have to read it yourself to find out why I find it so exciting."}, {"userName": "M\u00e5rten Ericson", "userReviewDate": "Jun 24, 2012", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/8323934-m-rten-ericson", "userReview": "The story of \u201cExistence\u201d, Brins first novel in about ten years I think, is a complex multi character, multi idea, multi side story based rather complex super hard sci fi work about deception. Again, this is hard SF. It is as far from any soapy space opera you can come and the wide variety of characters in the story includes (among others) a Chinese slum family, a Rastafarian pop-scientist (really cool by the way, wish we could have seen more of him), an author, a super intelligent news reporter (later becoming a cyborg like entity), a Neanderthal girl, synthetic self-aware aliens, a jet-set space junkie and much more. I will not go into analysing or rating David Brins writing techniques since he is in fact already a very accomplished writer, and the continuous publication of his books will have to stand as a quality stamp on his authorship. However, his contemporary writing in \u201cExistence\u201d in fact reminded me a lot of that of William Gibson and the world that Brin portraits has much in common with that \u201ccyberpunk\u201d, \u201calways online\u201d \u201cfully embedded\u201d world so often pictured by Mr Gibson.Unfortunately Brin also picks up another of Gibsons less appealing traits. Sometimes you simply have no idea what the heck the current chapter is about or what relation it has to the main story. To make it worse, in the end of the book the reader is forced to recognise that many of the side plots didn't really have a meaning at all \u2013 nor are they concluded in any apparent meaningful way. One can only wonder why Brin has made it such, or why the editor let it slip through, but in the end this enormous work clearly has the feel of a great synthesis of smaller stories rather than a dense monograph. Now, for those readers interested in the first contact problem, or the fact that to date there is no extra-terrestrial contact, this book is on the other hand a goldmine of intellectual sharpness, debate and dissection of the aforesaid problem. Honestly I think there are single pages in the beginning of the book that is worth the whole amount that I paid for it.Also Brin offer an apparent connection to the uplift theme of his best known novels (see the Uplift trilogy \u2013 \u201cSundiver\u201d, \u201cStartide rising\u201d and \u201cThe uplift war\u201d), though I should say that as the story unfolds, the evolution of it does not really lead towards the universe of these earlier stories. In fact Brin expands his uplift idea to embrace surrogate births for Neanderthals, extensive cyborg/prosthesis usage and civil rights for the Ai community. As far as my taste goes it becomes a bit too much really, Brin is trying to fit too much in the story (or the world), and the universe in \u201cExistence\u201d does not really portrait a future that I agree with, nor find enormously interesting. However that is not to say that our future might not turn out in a similar way.One last significant drawback is that the book is too long. Not so that the six hundred and fifty pages are too much per se, but the main story stops at about page 490 and what comes after that really should have been the material for a book of its own. (Read \u2013 Brin should have thought about the final events more thoroughly). If the book actually had stopped at this point I would probably have given it 5 stars, but as it is now, the extreme complexity and variety of themes and characters in the end becomes too much for Brin to handle and several of the characters in the story simply disappears in the time-gap between part six and seven of the book. Thus the end does not fully connect to its opening problem, the driving theme of the story. It does not really answer the questions put forward earlier. Thus David Brins \"Existence\" will only get 4 well-earned stars."}, {"userName": "Tim Pendry", "userReviewDate": "Apr 05, 2013", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/1016626-tim-pendry", "userReview": "I found this a very disappointing book after all the hype from the transhumanist community about Brin and the constant appearance of the book on my social media.There is some interesting and innovative thinking here (although perhaps less so to anyone who has actually 'worked' Second Life'). Brin can also write well about character in short bursts.This is overwhelmed by the standard faults of contemporary scifi - too many ideas not taken to a conclusion, an inability to take a stand that is not ultimately sentimental and neologism to excess.The real problem here seems to be the triumph of marketing over classic editorial engagement - not an uncommon problem nowadays.Three quarters of the book is a slow moving mix of alternating adventure (the best parts), didacticism (all rather basic preaching) and experimental writing that just does not work all that well.Then, just as one is settling into this near-glacial flow, and taking an interest in the fate of at least one or two of the characters, the book suddenly stops and jumps into a final fifth of space opera.Was this deliberate? Or was Brin simply finding that this massive tome would meander on forever into multiple volumes and needed to be 'concluded' for the bookshelves and the kindles.The whole things smacks of editorial indulgence. The book could have been so much better with an editing down of 30% of ideas and text, an improved bridge between the sections and greater balance betwen them.Brin can be very good at adventure and at character, though his characters are still mostly symbols rather than people while his aliens seem more real on occasions than his humans.But some of the personae are just plain irritating - I would willinglly have shot Profesor Noozone out into the furthest reaches of the galazy - while whole story lines are suddenly abandoned.Whatever happened with the Chinese mother and her autistic supporters in the Disney Park? Who was behind the machinations over the stones? and is that all with the snotty rich kid and the dolphins?We have critiqued the messiness and indulgent populism of modern science fiction before (see http://www.goodreads.com/book/show/83... ) Those criticisms hold for 'Existence' to a large extent. It seems to be a crisis in the genre.Truly great science fiction takes one or a relatively few ideas and works it or them to the limits without equivocation. The thinking takes place in the mind of the reader and not all on the page.'Menu' science fiction - throwing idea after idea without development so that the reader can pick what he or she likes according to taste and mental wallet - is what you get in a market-driven culture.Here, nothing is properly developed because it is a novel of alternatives from a primer on human fates and destinies - it is a list of possibilities that end up becoming sillily absurd by the end.So there we have it.

This is science fiction doing what it does best - asking questions about what it means to be human, and about what we are doing wrong and could do better. This is what I expect from my science fiction: if I haven't been made to think, I've been wasting my time.Earth touched on the Fermi Paradox (roughly: since it seems likely that intelligent life is common in the universe, where is everybody?), but Existence grapples with this question head on, as well as with the matter of how humans would respond to one of the possible answers to that question. He's heavy on the social commentary as well, much more so than he did with Earth, which wasn't short of damning criticism of some sections of human society. Our planet has a past in this book, much of it bad (what really happened on Awfulday?): there are plenty of refugees around. Here is our potential, and here is how far we are falling short. It is, in some ways, inspirational.It's also a good yarn, which kept me turning pages until the conclusion, which kept me guessing until the end. It's a convoluted yarn, yes, but convoluted keeps the brain working, which can only be a good thing.This book is more like Earth, or Heart of the Comet, constrained by Einstein, than the Uplift novels (although he touches on this concept, and there may be potential to examine how Uplift might be different in this universe).

Existence is a \u201cfirst contact\u201d science fiction book in which Brin presents some interesting and unique concepts that could have been woven into a very informative and interesting story. Unfortunately, Brin failed to accomplish that because the strangely disjointed narrative throughout the book did not provide a natural flow to guide the reader through satisfying experience. Brin includes a large number of interesting characters, long segments of their dialogue with each other, and even longer passages of their thoughts. Many of these passages were very interesting, but many of them did not seem to be relevant to any continuing story for the reader. In addition, after suffering through these long and seemingly irrelevant portions, many of the characters that the reader becomes acquainted with just vanish from the book without any explanation. In addition, the extreme length of this book combined with the lack of a coherent narrative exacerbates the reader\u2019s confusion.

Partly because it got better, things started to come together eventually, and the characters grow on you at least a bit. Partly because Brin's writing style is solid as always. But mostly because this is a mind blowing epic of a book. Neo-Feudalism, the Fermi Paradox, the problems with AI, transhumanism, and all the ways the world might end (or at least end for us) are all touched on, along with a number of other topics. This is Brin at his best, dealing with Big Concepts from autism to Uplift (though this is certainly not part of Brin's Uplift universe). Central to the book is the Big Question, how do we survive all the traps laid for us by a hostile or at least uncaring universe? How do we survive our own nature?

Yes, I know futuristic science fiction often has new language, but it is usually either explained or self-explanatory. The major of the slang in this book had my re-reading passages to figure out the meanings.Overall, this story was too broad and reaching for me.

Similar to Tad William's _Otherland_ (the fantastic first book _City of Golden Shadow_, not the horrible sequels), Dos Passos's _USA_, or particularly Brunner's _Stand On Zanzibar_ (to which Brin alludes, actually, in having a alien say \"what an imagination I've got.\")The overriding theme is, of course, the Great Silence. Brin's solution, characteristically for a guy who wants to be the ultimate moderate and more moderate than thou, is to take up every solution: the Great Silence is due to more efficient physical transportation *and* memetic viruses *and* Berserkers *and* Lurkers *and* panspermia *and* ecological collapse *and* nuclear war *and*... This is a little impressive to behold, and overall, I did enjoy reading the book. Brin has had a few new ideas since _Earth_ like the smart-mob.But for the bad:This jumping makes the book something like a huge primer on the Great Silence/Fermi's Question, yes, but *also* for something of a mess of a book. The book is huge, but a good deal of the bulk is fat and self-indulgent:1. the dolphin sub-plot is rehashed Uplift material, which only very charitably has any relevance to anything else in the book (I thought that we would at least see them towards the end on spaceships as a token nod toward justifying the time spent on them, but no!)2. More germane subplots feel incomplete; the autistic kids, \"cobblies\" and the \"Basque Chimera\" form one such oddly underjustified subplot - is this a thing, now, lauding crippled autistic kids as secret savant heroes? I don't know which narrative is more denigrating of the human suffering involved, the standard one or this one. (Autism spectrum may be useful in some areas, but only a *little* is necessary and even the high-functioning often fail: I read in the _New York Times_ the other day that that famous tech firm which uses autistic workers has a 5/6 rejection rate of applicants just from the start. One must sift a lot of sand.)3. much material is borrowed from his previous nonfiction or fiction; allusions to _The Postman_ are well and good, but when I could predict the resolution of the Senator Strong mystery from the instant we were told it was an addiction... This also means that I can track how many authorial mouthpieces there are in the novel, and it's pretty much *all of them*. Even people you think are wrong like Hamish are just acting as conduits for Brin's own beliefs. This leads to the severe problem, in a repeated first contact novel, that none of the aliens were remotely alien, and the humans all seemed pretty similar to each other too. It made me wish for Stanislaw Lem, or at least Watts's _Blindsight_.Brin also has a very weird attitude towards what he calls extropianism but most people these days just call transhumanism. For example, the bogus anti-caloric restriction argument Hamish gives; it is bogus because (a) none of those monks or monasteries are following nutritionally balanced diets, indeed, usually for religious reasons they're following highly unbalanced diets if they're not like the Taoists possibly actively poisoning themselves with mercury, and (b) the records do claim countless instances of extreme longevity, which of course we don't believe because record-keeping was terrible - which means the evidence is so worthless and biased and corrupt that we can't use it to claim the opposite either! I've told Brin this like twice before, not that he cared. But by the time the story is set, the caloric restriction question will be settled: the primate studies will be finished, the human CRers will be dead, and the underlying biochemistry (or lack thereof) will have been elucidated. Suppose he's wrong? He probably doesn't care, he's dead-set against it anyway! I was a little awe-struck when he has his mouthpiece badmouth cryonics, *after saying it worked and there had been revivals*? WTF?WTF indeed. This attitude could be called schizophrenic. Throughout the novel, Brin seems to struggle with the fundamental problem posed by Vinge: how does he keep the story human given his belief in progress and his basic acceptance of the Strong AI thesis? He never comes up with a good answers, but blatantly hand-waves them away: an emulated rat brain goes critical and escapes into the Internet? Well, uh - nothing happens because I say so (wow, ain't it strange)! There are even more AIs pervading the world, controlling countless key functions? Well, uh - nothing happens because I insinuate something about parents and children and them being grateful! (wow, ain't it strange - ever see a grateful river, spider, tow-truck, computer...? Humans can barely be grateful, ever.) Humanity is a few decades away from a general nanofactory assembler in his story and thousands of crystal probes come to visit? Well, uh - the crystal probes are completely inactive and don't carry nanofactories or *anything* despite it being a mindbogglingly great & evolutionarily fit idea and perfectly doable for them, because I say so and it lets me write adventure arcs with primates fighting over & chucking around glowing rocks! (wow, ain't it strange) He'll mock the extropians in the first part for believing in cryonics or uploads or AIs even though their most-criticized belief, cryonics, has been vindicated 100% in his story even beyond their hopes, their expectations of uploads are equally justified by events towards the end - non-destructive uploading, even! We'd settle for destructive uploads at this point... and so on and so forth. Well, uh - they're right but they're wrong, don't you see!

I'd never really understood that accusation of modern SF... until now. (I would have given it 3.5 if I could.)It took me more than a fortnight to finish reading this. For fewer than 550 pages, that's... well, for me that's positively an age. I did consider giving up on it, several times in fact. But the ideas kept me coming back and made me determined to see it through, to see what Brin did with this sprawling, messy saga. And I think I'm glad that I did. Not absolutely positive, but probably.Anyway, let me first talk about the positives. There are some really, really awesome ideas here. The basic premise that drives the plot is a first-contact one, but done in a fairly unusual way: a crystal snatched from orbit, activated by human touch and sunlight, that appears to contain alien life of some sort. The unfolding drama of the knowledge revealed - and how it changes, or at least develops, over time - and how humanity deals with it is a genuinely fascinating take on Fermi and all the other variations on \"where are the aliens, what will they do when they get here, and how will we respond?\" That's the plot, boiled down to its essentials; and it was fairly intriguing.Also intriguing was the world Brin set this alien contact against. If there's a clear explanation of when this is occurring I missed it, but it seems to start only a few decades from now. Complete climate collapse has not occurred but is still very much on the cards; technology has continued to advance in leaps and bounds, towards smart-specs and similar toys imagined by cyberpunk so many decades ago but which still seem elusive in 2012; AI appears to have been achieved, along with other technological wizardry. I liked that there appeared to be variety in this world, in how people dealt with technology at least. I did not especially like the world itself, though - although this is not in itself one of the novel's negatives. The world is not quite dysfunctional enough to be a dystopia - although that would perversely probably have been easier to read. Instead this is a world apparently divided into ten Estates not just determined by wealth but by allegiance to such abstracts as Science and The Media; a world where inequality is as, if not more, entrenched than today, with apparently few people acting against it, and added fears of technology on the one hand and the 'Autism Plague' on the other; frankly, a world that I hope does not come to pass. From an objective point of view, this is a fairly well-described world, although I am unconvinced of its realism.The novel's structure is linear chronologically and inconsistent in perspective. Numerous characters act as the focus over the 550 pages: the most prominent are a novelist, a journalist, a society lady, an astronaut, and a peasant. There are also excerpts of such non-plot devices as books and talk shows thrown in, which generally works. These different perspectives serve to give just that, of course - different perspectives on the world and on the events unfolding. Over the course of the novel, there was only one character that I particularly liked, and who did manage to get a word in for the entire length of the novel: the journalist, Tor. She had a fun role to play as the inquisitive, poking-nose-in type, despite various problems hampering her abilities. This brings me to one of the problems in this novel - two, actually. One is the characters. Most of them weren't necessarily unlikeable so much as they were unapproachable or uninteresting. Additionally there were a few characters who promised to be or do quite interesting things who just... disappeared. Their narrative stopped popping up, occasionally with little or no resolution to their particular quandary or arc. This was intensely frustrating. This is definitely not a novel for those who prefer their story to be character driven.The second problem was the structure itself. It was often unclear, at the opening of a new section, exactly who was speaking or where the events were happening. Sometimes that was cleared up, and at other times it was left opaque and mysterious. And sometimes these mysteries resolved with later revelations, but there are still some bits that don't seem to fit in at all, and really that just seems like a waste of words and my time. Thirdly, there's the world itself. I felt like Frank Poole, the dead astronaut who wakes up at the start of 3001: The Final Odyssey to find it's a millennium later, and suffers a fair amount of culture shock. Now I love cyberpunk and far future stuff, so culture shock isn't necessarily an unpleasant experience for me. But here, it just made me tired, and irritable. A new piece of technology? Cue eye-rolling and mutters of 'really? more?' - because it seems to be set in the near future (as someone one said, near future is within the reviewer's lifetime), and therefore improbable. The technology may not have been so overwhelming, though, if it wasn't for the language. Brin has messed with a lot of language to indicate how heavily reliant this version of the future is on computers, frequently turning 'a's into 'ai': aissistant, for example; or adding 'v', as in virtisement; or even combining both in vraiffiti. Add in a whole bunch of gobbledy acronyms (tsoosu=to see ourselves as other see us=viewing yourself through one of the innumerable cams in place in this world; hello, panopticon Big Brother), and I simply found it overwhelming. Overall, then, this is a big-ideas novel that is let down by two-dimensional characterisation and what occasionally feels like deliberately obfuscating language."}], "description": "Bestselling, award-winning futurist David Brin returns to globe-spanning, high concept SF with Existence.
