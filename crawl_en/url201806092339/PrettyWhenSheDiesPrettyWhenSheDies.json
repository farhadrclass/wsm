The professor decides that he wants to really screw with Amal (in more ways than one) and just lets her loose onto the human population. The professor, Amal's Maker (he's actually called \"The Summoner\"), gives Amal no instruction, no limitations, and literally stalks her to see what type of damage Amal causes while learning the vampire ropes. Amal has had a hard life and is a real fighter. So, when she is basically made one of the undead, she is going to do whatever possible to survive being a vampire. She sets out to learn more about her new status but along the way, certain aspects of her lifestyle, specifically the fact she needs to feed kind of causes problems. Like how does one stop feeding off of a human once you start? How does Amal learn everything? It is all trial and error. With trial and error, comes lots of bloodshed. Oops, I think Amal just sucked another human dry. It\u2019s not like she wants to, she is clearly remorseful and that makes her want to find a better way to do what she does. So, she goes on a search for vampire, that is where Cian comes into the story.With Cian\u2019s help, Amal learns the ropes. However, The Summoner is not too happy with Cian's interference. The Summoner is extremely powerful, before he was a vampire, he dabbled in necromancy. Combine the two, and you have one seriously powerful and messed up vampire.So now that Cian and Amal are joined at the hip (and eventually at the lips, tongue and various other parts), the Summoner is mad and well, he\u2019s not going to take it anymore.The characters Besides Cian and Amal, you have a great assortment of side charactersSamantha- Cian\u2019s fianc\u00e9e. Now all you people who hate cheating. Never fear, this is not what you think. Seriously.Roberto- Cian\u2019s butler; or as Amal calls him \u201cCian's bitch\u201d. He doesn\u2019t want to share Cian with anyone and lets his feeling be known.Grandmamma- best grandma character ever! Loved her.The Bad Some errors I think this book has been edited quite a few times since she originally released it but there are still a few clumsy passages or flat out errors. For example, in one paragraph, the author meant to write \u201cJeff\u201d but instead wrote \u201cCian\u201d. I knew she didn\u2019t mean \u201cCian\u201d since he wasn\u2019t in the scene for that part of the book and this was dialogue.The clumsiness and errors did not take away from the overall story. I think that in itself is a testament to how good the actual story is.Beginning dragged Poor Amaliya. Seriously, she had some horrible luck in the beginning of the book. The first 25 to 30 percent of the book is Amal trying to survive her new vampire status. She is Hungry, and she needs to Feed. It is depressing to the reader to go through Amal\u2019s struggles for so long. I kept thinking \u201cenough already\u201d. Later in the book, you discover how significant those struggles are. The fact that Amal lives through those first few days\u2019 means something. I just can\u2019t tell you.The cover I hate the cover. Not because it is gross or scary but because it doesn\u2019t really reflect the story as a whole. This book isn\u2019t a horror book. Sure, there are horrific elements and the author does not spare us any graphic detail but it is also an urban fantasy, has lots of witty humor and even a very charming romance. Overall How much did I like this one? If I could have (work got in the way), I would have not stopped reading it. When I was done, I wanted another book- asap!Disclaimer- The book is only 1.99 right now so if I\u2019m wrong and the book sucks, you aren\u2019t wasting a ton of money."}, {"userName": "Giselle", "userReviewDate": "Feb 22, 2012", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/4800103-giselle", "userReview": "FREE on Kindle until May 6th! http://www.amazon.com/Pretty-When-She...__What would you do if you woke up buried in the ground? Well Amaliya first took a shower (duh!), then what comes next involves blood. Lots and lots of blood. Left on her own to find out what she is, and how to survive it, Amaliya has a pretty rough beginning into her new vampiric life. However, she soon proves to be a pretty bad-ass heroine by, well... improvising. She's a fighter through and through. Instead of whining about her horrible situation, she goes out there and figures it out. Embracing it, even. Which I found especially awesome. It's not without a kill or two\u2026 or three, but eventually, she finds another of her kind. This is where Cian comes along.Cian is centuries old, and the master of Austin. He doesn't know what he's getting into when he decides to take Amaliya under his wing. Let me just tell you, it gets hot. Very hot! That is, until Samantha - Cian's human fianc\u00e9 - and his servant Roberto comes along. Things get very cold, fast. Neither wants Amaliya around, so as you can guess, you can also expect plenty of back-stabbing and betrayals. As usual, good or bad, all the characters are incredibly well written and perfectly flawed. Even the side characters play a major role in the story. I can't fail to mention Sergio and Grandma which, with their humor and charm, became instant favorites.\"It's the irony of being a vampire. Being immortal and being terrified of death.\"Gritty and dark, the vampire lore in Pretty When She Dies sticks to the original blood drinking, day sleeping vampires; they're dangerous and violent. I loved the overall world building, in particular, the addition of necromancy (which means we also have some zombies!) that shakes it up a little giving us an extra twisted plot and epic fight scenes. This necromancer - they call him The Summoner - can not only call on, and control, an army of undead, he's also a wickedly malicious and extremely old vampire. This makes him highly powerful as a villain. Believe me, he won't fail to intimidate you. How about this: To lessen his boredom, he creates vampires to set free, stalk, then kill. That's not barbaric at all... This book is definitely not without its fair share of action. I continue to be blown away by Rhiannon's crack-infused pages; keeping me glued to her words. Combining classic vampire lore, horror, and romance - she has given us another astonishingly compelling read.--For more of my reviews, visit my blog at Xpresso Reads"}, {"userName": "Jeann (Happy Indulgence) ", "userReviewDate": "May 04, 2013", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/6186603-jeann-happy-indulgence", "userReview": "Check out the review and interview on Happy Indulgence, along with your chance to win the entire trilogy on paperback & eBook! Actual Rating: 3.5Pretty When She Dies is a throwback to vampires when they were actually scary. You know, the ones that actually drink blood, rip apart their enemies, aren\u2019t afraid of gore and don\u2019t try to relive high school again.I found the book to be absolutely terrifying.It starts off with a bang as Amaliya wakes up buried underground and is absolutely terrified as she\u2019s blinded by darkness with dirt filling her lungs and claustrophobia. As she digs herself out of the shallow grave, she is frantic and plagued with extreme hunger. After cleaning herself up and realising that she\u2019s no longer human, she stumbles upon a college orgy and slaughters all the humans there with her bloodlust.The book follows on with a sick and twisted game of her creator, called The Summoner who stalks and terrorises her. After acting on her newly found vampire instincts, she\u2019s cast out by her family, forced to go down on a disgusting driver and finally meets her vampire mentor and lover called Cian. Cian takes Amaliya under his wing and they both plot to stop The Summoner\u2019s twisted games.If you haven\u2019t noticed already, Pretty When She Dies doesn\u2019t shy away from explicit scenes of gore, sex, and horror. I think the shock value of it really got to me at times. There\u2019s rape, murder, cheating, gore, demons knitted with human body parts with working sexual appendages, and lots of gorey, raunchy scenes.While the first half of the book covered her journey into the undead and learning how to cope, the second half sort of simmered as we met Cian and a bunch of secondary characters including his fiancee which I found super annoying. She\u2019s a jealous, bouncy, meddling woman who seeks out a vampire hunter to deal with her newfound threat. The whole time I just wondered how this was going to pan out and whether she was just asking for trouble.The coolest thing about Pretty When She Dies is that it features vampire necromancers who can raise the dead. I\u2019ve never stumbled upon anything like this and it is delivered in a chilling way.If you enjoyed the Blade movies, you\u2019ll probably like this book. Pretty When She Dies is great for a dark, gritty and scary vampire read that will put some disturbing images in your head. Most books nowadays romanticise vampires and unfortunately, it seems like I actually prefer them."}, {"userName": "Wendy Darling", "userReviewDate": "Apr 14, 2011", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/2745288-wendy-darling", "userReview": "3.5 stars Self-published, so it meanders and is not polished...but it's fun all the same.

And I honestly think it was this whole 'nice vampire' trend that went down a few years ago - I like my paranormal creatures to be scary, hardcore and gory, not all puppies and flowers and skipping through fields. Therefore I'm always a bit wary of vampire books, but I knew that Rhiannon Frater I was in pretty safe hands....and I definitely wasn't wrong.Pretty When She Dies is a 'proper' vampire novel - there's death, destruction, ghouls, hot vampire lurve, bad language and flawed characters - and I loved it all. The inclusions of well-known and lesser-known vampire lore also makes for fascinating reading - do religious icons really work, does a vampire need to be invited inside your home, does that garlic choker just make you smell like an Italian feast?From the moment Amaliya wakes up buried in the forest (greatest fear ever, anyone?) I knew she would be a character that I would love, and although her family life was pretty much a train wreck, she has a great balance of toughness and vulnerability, along with an unconditional love for those people who deserve it. I thought her grandmother was particularly awesome, and even the slightly irrtating Samantha had her redeeming features. Cian is one hot vampire, and definitely not in the sparkly sense - his story also added an extra facet to an already fascinating storyline.I love that Rhiannon Frater set this book in Texas - her knowledge of the state really shone through, and gave the book a gritty, real feeling.I dare anyone to read Pretty When She Dies and not love the characters whilst being fascinated by the examination of vampire lore and carried frantically from page to page with perfect pacing and realistic dialogue.

The main character of Amaliya gets turned into a vampire by her sexy professor Mr. Sumner [yeah, they have great names in this book]. She wakes up buried in the ground and is forced to big out of her own grave. That part was awesome, especially since I just finished watching the season of Buffy in which that happens. In the first one hundred pages, you might think this book is awesome. Violence, sex, blood, all the good stuff. There are grammatical mistakes, but it is a self-published book so that comes with the territory. The story itself drags you in and you want to know what is going to happen. That is until the romance plot tumor begins to show itself.As soon as Amaliya meets this older vampire named Cian, who is the Master of Austin there is an attraction. Cian gives Amaliya some of his blood and they start a sexual relationship. Problem is, Cian's engages to a human girl named Samantha. The whole affair pisses me off because there is no non-physical reason for Cian to be attracted to Amaliya, but he starts falling for her. He starts going on about how his relationship with Samantha was an illusion and that she made him a better human, but Amaliya makes him a better vampire. Bullshit like that. He says that he has to be a better vampire in order to protect his area. Including himself and Amaliya, only two mother-huggin' vampires live in the damn area. It's bullshit in order to make the relationship seem angsty, Not to mention, they try to make Sam the bad guy, when she is the one who goes out risks her life in order to save Cian's life. After they all risk their lives to save him, Cian has sex with Amaliya while everyone's waiting in the car. Sam then tells him the engagement is off and Cian says \"I understand.\" Ugh....I just hated it. Not to mention they declare their love for each other after three damn days. -massive eye roll-Plus, Amaliya gets a random ass power that she masters in two seconds, so I was eye rolling every single time she used it. It was just a book that started off strong, but crashed and burned.I spend 1.99 on this book and I regret even that."}, {"userName": "Mlpmom (Book Reviewer)", "userReviewDate": "Sep 07, 2012", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/3829694-mlpmom-book-reviewer", "userReview": "Okay so this wasn't exactly that happy go lucky romance that I normally read during this time of the year, nor was this one anywhere near the summer list of must read books I had created in my head, but I think that is exactly why this one was so darn good. It wasn't expected. I hadn't planned on picking it up and honestly, at the time, the only reason that I did was because I was in sort of a slump. I needed something different and not romance related (gasp, I know, I can't believe I just typed that). I needed something darker and something that would completely pull me away and put me in another place and mind set.This did that and then some. And to ease that nagging voice in my head that demands romance, this even had just enough of the hot stuff to keep her happy and satiated. I don't know what my problem is sometimes, I see the glowing reviews and praise and still, I hesitate to pick up a book and try it. I don't know, maybe I fear it won't live up to the hype. Not really sure but either way, we all do it. We buy a book based on a recommendation and then it sits there in our TBR piles and grows dusty and forgotten.Can I just say, I am so glad I pulled this one out and dusted it off?This was deliciously dark and called out to me in ways a book hasn't for a while now. It pulled me right out of my book slump and made me forget all about it as I was quickly thrown into the world the author had created.This isn't a lighthearted easy read. In fact, at times it will make you grimace and maybe even blush but we can't help but be fascinated with it all and be drawn into the story as what happened to Liya slowly unravels and unfolds and her new life begins.This was so well done. I have read a lot of vamp books in my life and this one truly does stand out, not because anything about it is new necessarily new or unique but because the writing and the story are just that good.

Don\u2019t get me wrong, they have powers that can be used for seduction in order to feed, true \u2013 but that is not what the book is about. This isn\u2019t a book about a vampire falling for a human and trying to make it work. In fact, it\u2019s a realization that it\u2019s not possible for that to work. Vampires are monsters and only in accepting and embracing that fact are they made strong.Another great thing about this book is Grandmama. She is an awesome character. I want to be just like her when I grow up with a very similar relationship to my grandchildren. She is feisty, courageous, loving and accepting of those she loves.I enjoyed watching the progression of the main characters, Amaliya and Cian. The character development was done with great skill. They are both likable, strong characters. This book has it all. Horror, romance, action, betrayal and the underdog overcoming obstacles. I'll be finding more of Frater's books as soon as possible.I believe this was written as a stand alone novel but there is room for a series as well. I\u2019m curious to see if we will get more stories about Amaliya and Cian."}, {"userName": "Jennifer (Bad Bird Reads)", "userReviewDate": "Jul 17, 2013", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/6864850-jennifer-bad-bird-reads", "userReview": "http://readingandwritingurbanfantasy....At A GlanceBookgasm!!!The GoodYou know when you are eating a calorie free hot fudge brownie sundae while getting your feet massaged by a bare-chested Chris Hemsworth and you realize you are NOT dreaming? Yeah, that's what this book is like for me. Oh, the love I have for this book. It makes me feel tingly all over. I actually have the other two books of the series, but I am holding off a bit on starting them because I want to stretch out the happy happy joys joys I feel for this series. Sure, I've only read Pretty When She Dies, but did you guys ever get that feeling where you just KNOW that you are going to love the rest of a series? I have that feeling now. I actually had to force myself to put this book down just so I could prolong the experience. Every time I devour a book I love too fast, I get so sad that it ended so quickly. I wasn't going to do that with Pretty When She Dies. I had to spread the fun throughout the day, savoring the tummy butterflies I got every time I picked it up again. Amaliya was AH. MAZ. ZING. She is one of my new favorite characters. She is not your typical heroines. She's dark in every sense of the word. She has dyed black hair, tattoos, piercings (*cough* nipple piercings *cough*), she likes hardcore metal music, and she likes the bad boys (she's looking for her Led Zeppelin prince charming). But when she is brutally turned into a vampire, left in a grave to dig herself out, and abandoned by her creator to figure out what being a vampire means, we see her vulnerable side. I think she did pretty good at taking care of herself. She turns out to be a badass vampire, even if she is feeling her way through it blind when it comes to her new undead state. Eventually, she comes to embrace her new lifestyle. But before all that, she comes up with a plan to find another vampire that can help her learn what it means to be a vampire. And she finds Cian. Cian has a dark past but has come to live a life close to being a human. He is the Master of Austin and likes his quiet life as the only vampire in the city. Amaliya messes up his \"perfect\" existence with her presence, especially since he is so attracted to her. Because Cian has a fianc\u00e9, a human fianc\u00e9. But Cian feels responsible to help Amaliya learn the vampiric ways. He knows her creator is evil and she needs all the training she can get to help keep herself alive from the creator's sick games. Cian is hot, and only gets sexier as the book goes on. I loved that he just couldn't resist Amaliya because she brought out an interesting side of his character. He's a good guy, but he needed to embrace his vampire side so bad. Once the human stick up his but was removed, Cian became a force to be reckoned with. The side characters were pretty awesome as well. Despise most of Amaliya's family being major asshats, her grandma is there for her no matter what. Her grandma was pretty badass herself, and had me cracking up. Samantha, Cian's fianc\u00e9, went through an interesting character arc. She was sweet, then crazy jealous, then mean, then fierce, then nice again. It was fun watching her go through the motions. Roberto. Oh, Roberto. Yeah, I will leave him as a surprise for you all. Pretty When She Dies is a gritty, dark, and hilarious vampire book that will leave you giddy. The dialogue was done right and had those hints of humor that I love. The characters were all complex and interesting. The story was fascinating and refreshing. I liked the addition of zombies and how The Summoner (Amaliya's creator) could control them. It was creepy as hell. The action was intense and could get pretty gruesome which worked for this book. I am going to keep my eye on Frater's books for now on because she is a great writer. The BadThe beginning is a bit slow, but it picks up pretty fast after that. The SnugglyI LOVED Amaliya and Cian. Their lust for each other was so hot. They tried so hard to stay away from each other. Amaliya didn't want to screw up Cian's life more than she already had, and Cian was trying to stick with his bubbly, blond fianc\u00e9 who made him feel human. But once Amaliya entered his world, he couldn't help but relish being a vampire once again. I loved how they seemed so opposite at first, but it becomes obvious how similar they really are. It's like they grew into the perfect couple. Oh yeah, be ready for some Bow Chicka Bow Wow. We get awesome sexual tension and great sex scenes. Final ThoughtsNo doubt about it, I will be continuing this series. I hope it will make my favorite series list. Frater knows how to spin a gritty but humorous tale with characters you come to care about. Be on the look out for my reviews of the rest of the series in August because I have a feeling I can't wait too long before I devour the rest of the books. Very highly recommended.

Vampires with no morals? Immortals with Mount Everest sized egos? Yeah, the good old times before sparkly 900 years old vampire with \"forever teen\" syndrome. Do you know that Buffy/Edward T-shirt from J!NX? That is the best way to describe Pretty When She Dies. Book is full Buffy references, but also other popular vampire stories. I thought it was nice touch - it made it feel \"real\". Amaliya is no wallflower or damsel in distress. She is all but that. Blond goodie two shoes gone bad, goth, tattooed chick. Add to that unwilling baby vampire and you have trouble. First third book is a little bit slow - there's just Amaliya and her struggle with new vampiric nature. She does what she's best at - runs away. That's her only choice if she wants to survive. I liked that author didn't make her nowdays usual holier than thou type. Other charaters are pretty much well writen. Cain reminded me of Lestat by his actions and the way that he thinks. But, you are going to love Graandma the most. Story will keep you on the edge untill the end. All of you who like it down and dirty, will enjoy in sexy scenes. Only thing that I minded was steretyphical way of describing certain ethnic groups. Also, dialogues sometimes seemed forced, as if author tried too much to be witty and fun. Second book in the trilogy, Pretty When She Kills, is coming out on September 7th.

It was gritty and very realistic in that if vampires did exist I wouldn\u2019t be surprised if when they first rose they had similar obstacles to overcome, namely the bloodlust and the inadvertent killing spree to sate it. There are good vampires, which seem rare in this book, bad ones and perhaps some that fall in between. The reasons the Summoner was evil were made obvious; his boredom and loneliness after so many centuries of walking the Earth had warped his mind - in some books you never know what turned the \u201cenemy\u201d to the dark side.The characters were believable and their development over the course of the book was well done. Amaliya was tough, she\u2019s a survivor of both physical (what the Summoner does to her) and emotional (her cruel screwed up family) pain who has learned that running away when things get hard is the best thing to do but finds that with the Summoner on her tail there is nowhere for her to run that he won\u2019t find her so she\u2019s forced, mostly by Cian, to make a stand and fight. The romance between Amaliya and Cian progressed from \u201cmaybe I should kill her\u201d to \u201che\u2019s not my type he\u2019s too short and clean\u201d to forbidden love/lust and finally relief that they could be together. I liked Cian\u2019s transformation. His appearance changed from clean shaven good guy in hiding to a rougher, more confident and alert politician ready to take on the vampires. Obviously my favourite character was Grandmamma \u2013 wow, I was right there with her grandson Sergio in his shock, disbelief and finally laughter after the revelation about her love life. I was glad when their fear of what Amaliya had become gradually turned into acceptance, unlike the reactions of her cruel family. I have to admit that I fully expected Grandmamma to let her religion get in the way of her accepting Amaliya\u2019s new state and was waiting for her to call her the spawn of Satan and attack her granddaughter. I wish she was my grandmother, she\u2019s a fierce but loving woman \u2013 no man or woman would want to cross her.I don\u2019t really want to make this comparison but Pretty When She Dies does remind me of certain aspects of Laurell K Hamilton\u2019s Anita Blake series. The Master (vampire) of the City system, the messed up zombies made from multiple body parts, the necromancy are all similar but I think this book is tighter and perhaps darker in its very isolating you-against-the-world nature.

Her professor of psychology is actually a centuries old vampire known to most as 'The Summoner' for his ability to command the dead to do his will. I KNOW RIGHT?! So she does the only thing that she can think to do, she goes 'home'.Amaliya's version of home is my version of hell- twice over. Her father is a mean SOB, who married her cousin- RIGHT AFTER her mother died of cancer. Her aunt is a toothless biotch, spat from bowels of Satan himself... As you can imagine, they weren't all that sympathetic to Amaliya's predicament and throw her out almost immediately after her arrival.Amaliya is walking down the highway wondering how her life turned out like THIS- when Pete, (awwww... Pete!) an old friend, pulls up next to her and offers her a ride... *winks*After a few hours of INTENSE, passionate lovemaking and him confessing his long-standing love for her... things start to go horribly astray when he flips on the light and finds that she has no reflection in the mirror!!! Yeah... OMG.Making her way to Dallas to see her Grandmama (duuuuude, Grandmama is the highlight of my LIFE. Loved her!) she hitches a ride with a chick and quickly realizes it was NOT a good plan!\"Not even five minutes had passed and now she had to deal with a batshit crazy woman.\"\"It was freaking hard to be a poor ass Texan vampire.\"I LOVED Amaliya. Seriously, she was rock your face off AWESOME! As were ALL the characters in Pretty When She Dies! After her very 'exciting' visit with Grandmama and cousin she heads to Austin hoping to find another vampire to understand her new life... since her creator is obviously going to be more trouble than anything else!In Austin she meets Cian, who is engaged to the very HUMAN, very sweet, fun, and somewhat naive Samantha! Things start to get a tad out of control between Cian and Amaliya... and by 'out of control, I mean H-O-T. Yummy hot.\"She had woken up determined to learn what she could from him and then go off and find her own Rob Zombie lookalike. Or a young Ozzy Osbourne clone that would be nice. Or maybe both.\"Sam realizes she losing Cian and goes to a lecture on the supernatural, which is being given by a freaking VAMPIRE HUNTER! And she opens her big mouth and tell Jeff EVERYTHING about Cian and Amaliya...Roberto, Cian's right hand man, has grown tired of Amaliya's influence in Cian and his life and goes to DRASTIC measures to rid them of her presence!!!!There is an EPIC fight between The Summoner, and those he created... and Amaliya finds she has a LOT more power than she originally thought! *SQUEE* I can't wait for you to find out what it is!! You'd never believe me if I told you who fights on their side, and who ends up betraying them in the end...\"Love and hate were not so different when passion was involved.\"~ Not telling you who says this!Hands down, Pretty When She Dies is one of my FAVORITE reads of this year! Easily, one of the BEST vampire books I've ever read!Love, betrayal, murder... Romantic, funny and horrific... Amazingly compelling characters and an intensely fantastic plot! Theses are things that only Rhiannon Frater could blend together and make something this EPIC."}, {"userName": "\u2615 Kimberly ", "userReviewDate": "Sep 17, 2012", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/5082615-kimberly", "userReview": "Pretty When She Dies is a deliciously dark urban fantasy that quickly draws you in. Filled with vampires, necromancers, romance and kick-ass characters Frater took me on one heck of a ride. As a book addict, there is the high I constantly chase, that only an awesome, epic book can give me. Pretty When She Dies gave me that fix.When we first meet protagonist Amaliya she finds herself buried in a shallow grave on her college campus. At first she cannot remember who she is, but stumbles her way back to campus and her dorm room. She gets sick and showers, but soon realizes she is very hungry. Making her way out to the parking lot, she hears music and smells food. Things get very bloody, very fast. When she awakens in the morning, her college professor is there and confirms her worse fears; he has made her a vampire. Naked and covered in blood he gives her his jacket, declaring that is the only help she will get from him. Amaliya quickly realizes she needs to flee. The tale that unfolds is action packed, funny, terrifying and filled with endearing characters.The characters Frater has created are friggin awesome. Amaliya is sweet and bad-ass all at the same time. I quickly connected with her. She is a natural blonde, but dyes her hair jet black, sports tattoos and piercings. She loves rock and roll, and is studying to be a psychologist. Her creator is one freaky ancient vampire who completely gave me the chills! He is bored and turned Amaliya for his own amusement. He stalks her, to watch how she handles the change. *shivers* Cain is a centuries old vampire also created by the same creator and he controls Austin, Texas. He is smart, oh so smexy and about to marry a human named Samantha. He lives in an apartment building he owns with his servant Roberto who cracked me up one minute and annoyed me the next. His fianc\u00e9e Samantha is innocent, pure and completely annoying! Both Roberto and Samantha want Amaliya gone. This creates some interesting situations and double crosses. Amaliya\u2019s grandmother was an absolute hoot and at times she and the other vampire hunters stole the show. I loved their shenanigans and her fearlessness.The world building is fantastic. Frater brought this dark, gritty vampire world to life. There are no sparkly vampires here. While vampires act and behave like the vampires of old; sleeping during the day and living without reflection, Frater brought a new twist that blew my mind. I loved the history she provided regarding the Creator and Cain. The romance that develops is dripping with sexual tension and the dance was delicious, raw and hot. The relationship slowly developed into more and I enjoyed watching it unfold. The creator , known by some as \u201cThe Summoner\u201d can raise and control the dead. He is not at all happy with his new toy and when he discovers her strengths he sets out to control her. Frater created action packed scenes and gave such detail that I had a HD Movie with surround sound playing in my head. The tale wraps up nicely without the dreaded cliffhanger. Frater has breathed life back into vampires for me, and I cannot wait to read more.Fans of dark, gritty urban fantasy with kick-ass protagonist need to purchase Pretty When She Dies immediately. *just saying, can you tell I absolutely loved this book!* Frater skillfully brought the vampires of old lore to present day Texas and it will literally blow your mind. Pretty When She Kills is the next book in the trilogy and I will be bringing you the review later this month.Kimba the Caffeinated Book Reviewer"}, {"userName": "Saniya", "userReviewDate": "Dec 19, 2010", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/4048678-saniya", "userReview": "[image error]"}, {"userName": "Bunnycore", "userReviewDate": "Sep 18, 2017", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/50919516-bunnycore", "userReview": "oh okay Pretty when she dies.. Amaliya wakes up dead, she starts craving blood and she can not figure out why people are just willing to give it to her. She finds out that she is a vampire and she has to leave college. She takes all this in stride for the most part, which I just find so hard to believe. I mean really, you wake up, you are a vampire and you go. Oh okay cool this is cool? um no I don't even care if you wanted to be a vampire there is going to be some sort of adjustment period somewhere.. some one help me out here? no one? okay cool maybe it is just me.. All I am saying is that really in the end that it is a pretty okay book I gave it four stars because really. If kept me engaged for something longer than a few hours. It wasn't a long book and I am going to most likely pick up the second one. back to the story... so Amaliya finds her way to Austin from there she meets up with Cian, they both have the same creator. Cian is going to marry a human, wants to be human. He is trying to be a good vampire and he is supposed to kill Amal for being anywhere in his territory but can't seem to do it because she represents everything he want's to be. She makes him feel alive again. Not the human that he is supposed to be marrying no no, the vampire Amal. I am rambling and ranting.. -coughs- So Cian and Amal wind up having to battle the \"Summoner\" their maker and creator.. -turns on the boom box and que eye of the tiger- this is where Amal finds out that she has all the powers the Summoner has and is way more powerful then he is. Okay with all of this it is still a good book and really I am going to stick with the 4 stars I gave it.. I hope the second one is a little better tho I want more Amal, Cian, Samantha, Jeff, Grandma and the others. Grandma was great funny as all get out, Jeff too. I want to read more on this world and really it is based in Texas.. I mean right there I am hooked.. I love to read books based in my home state because I been to most of these places already so reading the author's prospective is great. Pretty when she dies. I really do recommend it..

Unfortunately they all went away when I fell asleep. So now to write my 'tribute' review of Pretty When She Dies. Amal-(I'm not even going to attempt to spell her full name) is a woman in her mid 20s from east Texas. She has been in college twice trying to escape a very rough life. Both her sister and mother died of cancer. Her dad married her cousin. Her aunt Mae is a toothless hag from hell and her brother seems to be a complete douche. Her only redeeming family, her grandmama and primo Sergio live in west Texas. Amal is away at college when she meets a handsome Professor who seduces her. The book starts with her waking up in her grave...a newly turned vampire.The good:The story is well written and the last half flows beautifully. The characters are all well written and the protags are likeable. I loved Cian. He was great. The vampires in this book are REAL vampires. The are blood loving fiends. I loved that. No angsty teenage vamps here. Sure Amal has her fair share of angst going on in the beginning of the book but she gets over that. The Summoner was scary but in a good way. I hated him. What a creeper. There is plenty of action in this book although the showdown at the end was my favorite. Gotta love little mexican grandmas. Samantha, Cian's fiance, was annoying. Cian's man servant was also a major creep. The bad:The first chapter or so drags. It's not until Amal gets on the road to self discovery that it really picks up. This might have been done on purpose so the reader goes through the same disorientation that Amal does. That is really the only bad thing I can say about this book. Amal is kick butt. Cian is a fox and what happens when they meet is magic."}, {"userName": "Laura *Little Read Riding Hood*", "userReviewDate": "Sep 24, 2012", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/7229032-laura-little-read-riding-hood", "userReview": "A fantastic back to basics vampire story! No day-walking, animal blood drinking, whiny pining to be mortal babies!What was there not to like ... ok LOVE about this book? It was a refreshing return to traditional vampire lore; sunlight kills, no eating animals, have to be invited inside someone's home ... It was great!There are two clear halves to the book, the first half where Amaliya is trying to figure out what happened to her, and adjust to her new \"life\", and the second half, where she meets other vampires and learn about her maker. If I had to pick a favorite half, I am not sure I would be able to. They are just to different; like comparing traditional vampires to sparkly vampires. They both drink blood but that is pretty much it.I really felt for Amaliya during her struggles. She had a pretty tough life, and her after-life isn't shaping up to be so hot either. Due to he upbringing, she has next to no self-esteem, but is pretty self reliant and stubborn. That turns out to be her biggest advantage.When she finally meets others of her own kind ... Oh Cian. (Pronouced Key-an) She wins the lottery when she meets him. Except he is engaged. To a human. But that's ok, he isn't even her type. Sure sure honey, keep telling yourself that. He is everyone's type.And the narrator, Kristin Allison, does a great job with the different characters. I never wondered who was talking. I was a little concerned right at the beginning, because she seemed a little monotone, but it fits with the story. Just give it a sec. :-)I really have nothing bad to say about this book. I loved it and can't wait to listen to the next one, Pretty When She Kills."}, {"userName": "Ali ", "userReviewDate": "Mar 26, 2012", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/5847230-ali", "userReview": "First off...FYI...ebook at Amazon.com is only $0.99!I DEVOURED this book, I could not put it down! Which, is why it got the fourth star. Technically it is probably only a 3 star book but I so easily sunk my teeth (hee hee) into it that I had to up the rating a little. It's got it's editing issues, but I was able to look past that...mostly.Amaliya, for me, is a young-modern-inked up-sexed up-slightly trashy-female Vampire Lestat. She doesn't really know who she is, where she belongs, who loves her or why anyone really would. She's a sad creature who falls under dire circumstances and has to fight her way in an unknown world. She's no simpering weakling though, she's a fighter and I loved that about her though she isn't the most endearing character I've ever read, she's a screw up - but hey aren't we all at times.At one point, I thought wow - this author really is not going to give this kid a break! It was cruelty after horror after bad luck after dumb ass mistake.The characters where all fairly interesting, some (Sam) with a nice side helping of annoyance. Some with humor. Some with pure sex appeal. And this book has its fair share of sex. Not a recommendation for the youngins - this is NOT your Sparkly Happy Vampire Love Story!!Overall this was a fun read and I will happily follow the series!"}, {"userName": "Kerstin (under_moonlit_skies)", "userReviewDate": "Jul 25, 2010", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/3901811-kerstin-under-moonlit-skies", "userReview": "This was a great story, grittier and darker than a lot of the other UF I usually read and I really enjoyed it. Amaliya is a great heroine and we meet her when she wakes up in her own grave, having to dig herself out, only to find out that she is a vampire now. We go on a journey with her to find more of her kind and hopefully take revenge on the guy who made her, an age old necromancer and vampire who is truly evil and made her only so he could toy with her. She also has to try and figure out what abilities and limitations she acquired after the change and learn how to keep the blood-lust in check. When she meets Cian, the master of Austin, a vampire who tries hard to be more human by being engaged to a bubbly (and at first sort of annoying) human woman and stay away from other vampires, she inadvertently turns his life upside down. They help each other accept what they truly are and do everything to rid themselves from their mutual maker.As I said before this was a really good story with great characters. Cian wasn't the usual beautiful vampire hero, but an average looking guy who wasn't overly romanticised which was quite refreshing for a change. The supporting cast, which consists of Amaliyas Grandmama, my personal favourite, her cousin, Cians fianc\u00e9e and a vampire hunter were all wonderfully written.

Not at all. I also found the story line to be a bit too predictable. There were some funny moments, but overall Amaliya was too oblivious and dumb for me.Also, and I only bring this up because this popped up a few times throughout the book, while I found the heroine's name really pretty and unusual, what the heck is the point of other characters pointing this out? Why go to the trouble of explaining that Amaliya's name is Russian but the spelling might have been altered? And then her little sister's name is Rachel?! Lame! Well, not Rachel the name itself, just that Amaliya gets this name that had thought and effort put in behind it and then there's Rachel...better than Raychel or something but still. What's the point of all this anyway?!Romance was so obvious and not really an issue, more of a convenience and a lust. Hopefully it works out for them.

I rather enjoyed her style of writing and am looking forward to reading her zombie trilogy.Pretty When She Dies... not exactly a title that left me super curious about the book, but that cover sure did. In case you haven't been watching, I'm somewhat of a sucker for a good vampire story; especially if said story has vampires that aren't emo and vegetarian. No worries on that front in this novel. These vampires know what they need to survive and how to go about getting it.The book starts off with a bang; our main character pushing her way out of a grave and trying to figure out what the hell happened to her. From there it only gets better as she has to figure out how to survive as a vampire with absolutely no instructions from her maker (who's a real piece of work himself).Despite a few editorial errors, the novel was a hit with me. Great pacing and a kick ass heroine who has her faults and knows it. A few pretty hot sex scenes, great supporting cast of characters (love, love, loved the Gramma), and a decent plot line -- not much more I could ask for in a vampire story... except maybe a sequel?"}, {"userName": "Diane", "userReviewDate": "Jan 13, 2013", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/4767034-diane", "userReview": "4.5We meet 24 yr old college student Amal as she climbs out of a grave after three days.

The girl stands covered in dirt and mud, wrenching it out of her lungs. Shakily, she takes in her surroundings. She was buried alive, but why? Who is she? She can't even remember her own name? Terrified, she heads to the lights below and slowly finds her way back to her dorm room. Her fuzzy memory is beginning to recall bits and pieces of her former life. Then a loud, dark beat of music pulsates to her hears. One minute she is standing outside the dorm room where a party is raging, the next she is covered in blood form her kills. A vile laugh rings in her ears. She looks up and sees her former professor laughing at her. He is the reason for her current condition. Her took advantage of her, killed and buried her after he changed her into a vampire. Now he mocks her and tells her she won't survive. Amaliya must find her way and acclimate to her life as a vampire, or die, but it certainly won't be easy! Will she rise up and fight back?What I Liked:*I loved that this starts out with the terrifying scene where Amaliya claws her way out of the grave, choking on dirt, terrified and unable to remember anything. It is a chilling beginning and the book keeps coming with some dark, gritty scenes. I cut my teeth on Anne Rice's Vampire Chronicles so I would thrilled to see that Rhiannon hearkens back to the vamps that I was first introduced to. They are dark monsters of the night, terrifying and scaring with a few shreds of humanity. There are no sparkly vamps in this one! It was obvious that Ms. Frater was influenced by Rice as well since there is even a reference to Lestat in this book. *I enjoyed the characters and admired the depth. I especially loved the Spanish speaking, tortilla making, God fearing Grandma who isn't afraid to take on the monsters. Innocente is a kick butt grandma for sure. I hope to god when I am seventy I can be as cool as she is! *This book has lots of story lines as well as a scary vamps, necromancers, animated corpses and more. There is a lot going on in this one. It is action packed and thrilling.*I loved how Amaliya transformed in this one. She, of course, undergoes her vampiric change but we also see how she spent the majority of her life getting kicked around. She certainly has the worst luck. By the end, though she is a vamp who takes charge and one who will be a force to be reckoned with, and I cannot way to see how she progresses. And The Not So Much:*This book has a lot of steamy sex scenes that got to be a little much for my taste. I am not prudish, but it seemed that every time I turned around there was more sexy time (cue in the cheesy porno music). I began to feel like a dirty peeping Tom. If you love vampire books with lots of sex scenes then you will enjoy this, if you are like me and they grow tiresome after awhile, just gloss over them and get to the good stuff, like vampires kicking the Necromancer's butt and taking on an army of undead corpses. *I liked how fleshed out all the characters were except for the villain, The Summoner. For some reason, he just never got to me and made me feel anxiety and hate. He was just an average villain. I wanted him scare the pants off me, but he didn't. Perhaps adding in a few scary scenes strictly from his view point showing how he took corpses, sewed them together and created his monsters would have done the trick.Pretty When She Dies was my first introduction to Ms. Frater's work, and it won't be my last. She crafts a dark vampire story that will keep you on the edge of your seat. She also adds in a cast of memorable characters who I will be excited to follow in subsequent books. If you are bored with all the pretty not so scary vampires and you want to get back to something a bit more menacing give this series a try.Favorite Quotations:\"As she trudged along, her bag swinging against her back, she sighed.

The dimmest of all the lights had grown to blind him and he had to take her.\"\"They were so terrible for each other and they both knew it. This never should have happened.\"\"I knew you were special when I took you. You were so pretty when you died. Exquisite in death.
