Not that I've experienced any that were. But it could easily have swung that way.It's about tween (11 y/o) who is auditioning for the Royal School of Ballet in England. It's not all cupcakes and sunshine - it's an actual kid, with actual people around them, aspiring toward actual goals. I love it."}, {"userName": "Beatrice", "userReviewDate": "May 11, 2012", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/8561907-beatrice", "userReview": "Ellie\u2019s Chance to Dance is about a girl called Ellie who moves from Chicago to Oxford because her mother gets a job as a professor at Oxford University. Ellie makes friends with a neighbour, Phoebe, who goes to her school. While she attends regular school, Ellie goes to a local ballet school and attends fortnightly classes as part of the Junior Associates program at The Royal Ballet School. But Ellie\u2019s dream is to dance full-time at the Royal Ballet School. Things aren\u2019t always easy for Ellie. She has to deal with jealous girls at school and at ballet, and she worries about her mother who has MS. My favourite part is when Ellie gets excited about applying for the Royal Ballet School."}, {"userName": "Alyssa", "userReviewDate": "Oct 04, 2008", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/1591217-alyssa", "userReview": "A really cute book on the TRUE life of a ballerina. (Take it from someone who knows) Yeah, it isn't just flouncing around like a pretty princess, it takes raw work and talent to fit the physically demanding role of a ballerina. NOW who says ballet isn't a sport?"}, {"userName": "Elizabeth", "userReviewDate": "Mar 14, 2012", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/8202694-elizabeth", "userReview": "I thought this was a great book about friendship and ballet. The book started off very sad but ended in a happy ending! I really enjoyed this because it showed meanings about friendship and dancing.

Elle's story shows how ballet is truly the most graceful yet toughest \"sport\" ever , yes I said sport because it really takes a determined athlete to be a successful performer/ballerina: a hell lot of practice,skill, hyper-flexibility and coordination and if you mess up a move you can seriously injure yourself!! Doing the vertical splits standing on a finger tip while keeping the body perfectly straight and not wobbling for a good 10 seconds!! And the pirouette position that requires centered balance to keep me from stumbling...There's nothing more difficult, but also, nothing more rewarding than ballet :)\u2665\ufe0f\u2665\ufe0f"}, {"userName": "Laura", "userReviewDate": "Mar 11, 2010", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/334836-laura", "userReview": "I really enjoyed this book! I know it's just a short children's book, but I thought it was interesting to read about a 10 year old who moves from Chicago to Oxford. I have also never read anything about ballet before, so that was interesting, too. I look forward to the rest in the series."}, {"userName": "Alicia Herret", "userReviewDate": "Jun 23, 2008", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/1260737-alicia-herret", "userReview": "Very good.

For Ellie, ballet isn't just a dream, it's become a way of life. She's danced for almost as long as she can remember and started ballet lessons when she was four. Now Ellie is presented with the opportunity of a lifetime-a chance to audition for a spot to dance with the Royal Ballet. But Ellie knows that even if she won a place, it would mean moving to London and leaving her ill-stricken mother behind with no one to care for her. When the day of the audition finally arrives, Ellie must decide between pursuing her dreams or sacrificing her goals of joining the Royal Ballet to be with her mother.
