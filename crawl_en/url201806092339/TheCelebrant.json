It didn't surprise me to learn that the original - published now more than twenty years - saw print through a University press; so, kudos to the University of Nebraska Press for recognizing the genius of the work and anticipating that the book could become a gift to those lucky enough to receive it.I wish I'd made a note as to how it ended up on my reading list. I expect I saw it on the newspaper sports page at the beginning of the baseball season, which would make sense, to the extent that it's on the list of Sports Illustrated's Top 100 Sports Books of All Time. So let's get the obvious out of the way: if you don't know or care about (and, potentially, love) \nbaseball \n, this book is not for you. It's an homage to the history of the game, if not a meditation or a benediction. If the phenomenon of sports iconography, of unabashed hero worship (particularly of the legends such as, here, Christy Mathewson) means nothing to you, I expect this will leave you cold. But if you love the game, if you've read, I dunno, Men at Work, or Summer of '49, or, Shoeless Joe, or, more recently, Moneyball or, on the fiction side of things, The Art of Fielding, or even the are-you-kidding-me, \"is it more bizarre that folks wrote, published, or read this\" restropsective Stephen King chronicle The Faithful, ... well, this is a must read.But ... but ... as geeky and as detailed and as micro and as myopically obsessive the baseball theme dominates, there is ... so ... much ... more to this - both in terms of the history - yes, lots and lots and lots of baseball (in the early 1900's, particularly the professionalization of the league, the leagues, the players, the World Series, and yes, the scandals) but also the immigrant (particularly Jewish) experience, life in New York City, travel (trains and those new automobiles), department stores, hotels, ... and, yes, the story itself, of coming of age, and family, and of expanding horizons, and self-examination, and change, and love, and loss.Part of me wishes that the baseball minutiae wasn't as dense so that more readers might embark up on the journey, meet the protagonist's family, and wonder at what aspects of the history are real versus imagined. But I can't imagine how non-baseball fans could penetrate the initial layer of breathless recounting (or re-imagining) of individual games (regardless how epic or significant they've become over time).Which brings me to the conclusion that I'll join those that deemed this one of the best baseball books ever, ... and that's plenty good enough for me."}, {"userName": "Joe Kraus", "userReviewDate": "May 18, 2018", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/2422229-joe-kraus", "userReview": "In some ways, the most intriguing part of this novel is its title. Like \u201calienist,\u201d celebrant is a word that once upon a time meant a combination of concepts that have since been refined and separated. Someone who was a celebrant was part fan, part artistic admirer of a performer, and part residual believer in some religious ritual. In that way, this novel sets out to explore the entwined and sometimes conflicting dimensions in which a young man comes to appreciate the baseball world of pre-World War I, a time during which the great Christy Matthewson emerged as the first of the all-time legends of the game. Jake admires Matthewson so much that he refuses multiple opportunities to meet him, choosing instead to design a commemorative ring as part of his work with his family\u2019s rapidly growing jewelry firm. He is, in that regard, a fan, someone taking pleasure at a distance from a man slowly being deified by a game that\u2019s attracting more and more attention from the American public.At the same time, Jake and his family are Jews, first-generation immigrants who \u2013 while growing in wealth \u2013 still experience anti-Semitism. (It\u2019s mild, but the most clear-cut example of it, harassment at the hands of a couple of players, rankles Jake for years.) He\u2019s still occasionally an observant Jew, and he seems confident his children will embrace the identity as well, but part of what he finds in baseball is the opportunity to embrace an American faith. He is, therefore, a \u2018celebrant\u2019 in the sense that he wants to bring out what he sees as the deep-seated purity of the game. He won\u2019t take money for the ring, for instance, wanting to keep his admiration pure.When you cross that insight with Greenberg\u2019s own celebrant-like appreciation for the first era in which professional baseball became the nation\u2019s real pastime, there are a lot of things to find interesting in the novel. The history is tight and clever; as a one-time committed adolescent baseball historian myself, I know a lot of these stories, and I\u2019m impressed to see them from fresh angles. We get \u201cMerkle\u2019s Boner\u201d in real-time, before it\u2019s frozen into clear-cut history. We get the Black Sox scandal as it slowly unfolds, before Shoeless Joe Jackson gets cast as a tragic figure for the century that follows. And, above all, we get the apotheosis of Matthewson, the first of the first players elected to the Hall of Fame, while he is still a human and not yet an eternal. In such a light, this book is exactly the sort I\u2019ve been looking for in the class my friend Will and I are preparing about the intersection of fandom and faith. Maddeningly, though, it falls short. As rich as it is in history and concept, it misses out on the real drama of creating characters who shape a larger narrative. It not only makes present the lost moment of the turn of the last century, but it also embraces that period\u2019s literary technology. This is a novel dominated by old-school Realism; it owes its style and form more to William Dean Howells than to the generations of innovators who\u2019ve come since.If Jake is the character who embodies the central intellectual conflict of the novel, he does so as a mostly empty body. There\u2019s no clear personal impetus, no explanation for why he in particular feels as he does. He\u2019s the family artist \u2013 with no backstory on how he came to be so \u2013 and that casts him in a role separate from his siblings.In contrast, Eli, comes to represent the serpent-like power of gambling in the face of baseball. He loves the game less for itself than for the prospect of using it to discover secret sources of income, to make it a joyful way to compete without paying the price of becoming an athlete himself. Eli is alive and energetic; he\u2019s clearly Jake\u2019s favorite brother, and he is the salesman primarily responsible for building the family business.From the other side, we have brother Arthur, who has no affection at all for baseball but recognizes ways of using it to help with their corporate growth. He represents a different serpent, not the original one that devastated baseball with the Black Sox scandal but rather the one that threatens it now, the one that sees it as nothing more than a commercial opportunity, one where profits have to be maximized without respect to the joy that inspired the game in the first place.Both brothers provide useful intellectual contrast to Jake\u2019s quiet, religious-like appreciation of the game, but neither does so from the perspective of a fully formed character. Each is a stock figure, defined expressly for the purpose of offering that contrast rather than as a character who finds his way to such opposition. All three are brothers, for instance, yet there\u2019s no explanation for how they turn out so differently.(SPOILER: In one of the closing scenes of the novel, with Matthewson slowly dying from the gas he inhaled during World War I, Matthewson explicitly compares himself to a dying Christ and holds Jake to a difficult purity of faith, one that means the end of Eli\u2019s hopes and, in effect, costs Eli his life. Just in case that point isn\u2019t clear, the novel\u2019s final words \u2013 as Jake reflects on what it meant to see his hero, possibly his savior, wither and die \u2013 are \u201cEli, Eli,\u201d the same words the dying Christ speaks on the cross.)It\u2019s frustrating to find a book dealing with such compelling topics that does so with so heavy-handed an approach. I know there are many who admire this as one of the really fine baseball books of the last quarter century, but I\u2019m afraid I don\u2019t see it. It is a remarkable act of baseball historical fiction, and it poses a series of thoughtful questions about the nature of fandom. But at that other level \u2013 the level of taking material and finding fully formed characters who seem genuinely to live \u2013 I don\u2019t find it all that compelling a novel."}, {"userName": "Resa", "userReviewDate": "Jun 19, 2012", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/10331451-resa", "userReview": "I'm not a huge sports fan by any means, but I grew up in a family that loved baseball and that's the one sport I've made an effort to keep up with over the years. If you are neither a sports fan nor a baseball fan there is a good chance you aren't going to enjoy this book. I'm telling you that right off the bat (no pun intended). While the book itself is written well and contains some much deeper themes than just \"sports\" if you don't have a love in your heart for baseball none of that will be enough to interest you.The Celebrant details the character Jack's relationship with Giants' picture Christy Mathewson. Jack adores Mathewson from affair, turning him into an idol and the ballpark his \"secular temple.\" Jack's family runs a jewelry business and through Jack's love of Mathewson he designs rings that catapult the business to huge success as well as a contract with MLB for championship ring design. This is just part of the story though. While the relationship between Jack and Mathewson, the idololized and the celebrant, is the focus for the majority of the book the text also explores the darker aspects of the game -- ending in the Black Sox scandal. This book should not be taken as a historical document of baseball in its early years, while the players are real this story is fiction and should be treated as such (although I do believe Greenberg did a decent job of staying true to the facts). Greenberg creates characters you feel you understand and empathize with, especially if you've grown up in a family that loved baseball. Jack's relationships with his brothers feel true to life and when he finally sees Mathewson as just a man it is the same feeling we've all felt when our childhood heroes turn back into mortals. A story of love, consequences, faith, and disillusionment \"The Celebrant\" is worth your time."}, {"userName": "Caroline", "userReviewDate": "Oct 29, 2007", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/541670-caroline", "userReview": "Fair warning - spoilers ahead.I wanted so badly to love this book, but in the end I just didn't. I keep looking at all of the 4 and 5 star reviews here and I have to admit that the book just didn't speak to me the way it apparently does others.I had a hard time becoming invested in the characters and (though there were exceptions here and there) I found the writing rather stilted and it was hard for me to read for long stretches - I'd get bored.Also, as far as the characters go, I found the main character's motivations not as explained as I would have liked. I understand idealizing a hero, but at times Jackie took it to an extreme that I found creepy.In a similar vein, this book was a weak 3 until the last 20 or so pages, where it became a weak 2. The problem: I flat out didn't agree with Jackie's behavior toward his brother. If my brother were in gambling trouble that I could help with, I certainly wouldn't decline to do so in order to please a baseball player I admired. Particularly when this absence of help results in his brother's suicide. Messed. up.Also, I found the allegory of Christy Mathewson's suffering to Jesus Christ's suffering on the cross, again, creepy. The dude is a baseball player. A talented, upstanding baseball player. I get that, but the fervor he seems to engender from both the author and his main character I just find rather off-putting. This was supposed to get me excited for baseball season, but it left such a sour taste in my mouth, I may need to read another baseball-related book to make up for it."}, {"userName": "James", "userReviewDate": "Apr 05, 2012", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/5810205-james", "userReview": "The Celebrant is rightfully regarded as one of the best baseball novels ever written. Mark Harris' The Southpaw resonated a little more with me, because I really go into the Henry Wiggen character and enjoy that casual, Huck Finn, kind of story telling. But Greenberg did a fabulous job in taking the reader back to the early 1900s, when Christy Mathewson helped broaden the game's appeal to those who thought it was ruled by uneducated ne'er-do-wells. The baseball detail is amazing. He really brings some of the most storied games/series in baseball history to life, through the eyes of his characters, blending the historic and the fictional as well as any book I can recall.The off-field story really picked up pace for me with the introduction of Arthur, Jackie and Eli's younger brother, who applies himself to analyzing and improving upon the family's jewelry business. His battles with Eli move the story to its tragic conclusion, and even though he seems overly ambitious, it's easy to understand why he feels it's important to protect the company from Eli's gambling."}, {"userName": "DT", "userReviewDate": "Aug 26, 2012", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/1550861-dt", "userReview": "I think you have to be a pretty big baseball fan to enjoy this book, which centers around the remarkable pitching career of Christy Mathewson in the early part of the 20th Century. Mathewson, along with a couple of more-recognizable names like Ruth and Cobb, was part of the first class of the Baseball Hall of Fame. The book was at its most \"inside baseball\" when it provided page after page of batter-by-batter commentary of games that ended over 100 years ago. It was at its best when it explored the refined relationship between Mathewson and the book's protagonist, a German Jewish immigrant jewelry designer named Yakov (or Jackie). I found this dynamic way more interesting than the play by play of Merkle's Boner, which isn't at all what non-baseball fans might imagine. Can you name anybody else in the inaugural Hall of Fame Class? If so, you'd like the book. If not, well, I'd be interested if you felt the same way as I did about Jackie and his family, or if the stories about Iron Jack McGinnity's fastball caused you to lose interest."}, {"userName": "Jacob", "userReviewDate": "Aug 11, 2013", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/20462112-jacob", "userReview": "There are not many truly great baseball novels. \"The Celebrant\" is the exception that proves the rule. Given the Black Sox Scandal's relevance to the plot, I can't believe it took me 20 years to read it. Historical fiction similar in style to Doctorow's \"Ragtime,\" and similar in emotional impact to Kinsella's \"Shoeless Joe,\" \"The Celebrant\" touches on so much of what it means to be a baseball fan, how we interact with our heroes, what it means to be an immigrant in America. Christy Mathewson was the first American baseball hero of the 20th century, and millions of young men and women idolized him like Jackie Kapp did. Greenberg's Matty may be fictionalized, but he brings us closer to the New York Giants' star pitcher than arguably anyone has ever done. That's the thing about great fiction: done well, it can sometimes be more \"true\" than nonfiction. \"The Celebrant\" is great fiction.

This novel is about a set of Jewish jeweler brothers and their anguished ways of being men. The narrator is obsessed with Christy Mathewson, the older brother is a degenerate gambler and the younger brother is obsessed with success. Christy Mathewson winds up being both a Christ figure and a fable about how fame corrodes human natures. Also a bunch of weird baseball nerd stuff and John McGraw acting like Mynheer Peeperkorn from The Magic Mountain. Slightly absurd in points but I would definitely put this on any short list of best novels about baseball."}, {"userName": "Fiona", "userReviewDate": "Oct 05, 2016", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/43681767-fiona", "userReview": "This book was gay and I will fight anyone on that."}, {"userName": "Drtaxsacto", "userReviewDate": "Oct 29, 2016", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/1280889-drtaxsacto", "userReview": "Even if you don't like baseball this is a fun read with a somewhat factual focus on Christy Mathewson - the Giants Ace at the turn of the century. It reads like it was written contemporaneously but it was actually completed in 1983. The story starts with a Jewish family who emigrates to the US. Like many immigrant families the older brother helps the younger one get an education. The main character is named Jackie. Early on there are two funny stories. Jackie's dad wants to move to Brooklyn and calls a landlord who asks \"Do you have children?\" To which the dad says 9. When he goes to the apartment the landlord, rejects him because he thought he had said \"nein.\" (The German NO). In Jackie's first encounter with baseball another player has a high slide which catches him in the cheek and the other player says \"Oh, Shit!\" and Jackie says those were the first two words I heard in baseball.Jackie is very interested in baseball and sees Mathewson pitch a perfect game. Instead of following his hero into the game he follows his older brother into his uncle's jewelry business. And early in his career, after the perfect game, crafts an elegant ring for Mathewson. That begins a distant relationship between the two until Mathewson's 1925 death from the lingering effects of poison gas in WWI.The main character has a diffident relationship with his hero. But his older brother develops a close relationship with the pitcher and eventually through his contacts and the main character's design skills builds a huge business. One other brother is prominent who seems to have a hard nosed approach to building the business. The older brother is also a skilled gambler, who often loses his shirt in betting on baseball. The interplay between the three brothers and their uncle Saul is well thought out. This reminds me of Zelig (the Woody Allen movie) because it weaves a very good story into historical events. It was really a fun read."}, {"userName": "Jay", "userReviewDate": "May 29, 2017", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/1618357-jay", "userReview": "[ In \u201cThe Natural\u201d, the critical choice at the end of the story was for the dying \u201cbaseball hero\u201d Roy Hobbs to throw the game for the gambler\u2019s money, while in \u201cThe Celebrant\u201d it was for Jackie the jewelry designer to throw over the gambler \u2013 his brother, at the behest of his baseball idol Mathewson, who is dying.

When Mathewson threw his first no-hitter in St. Louis, Jackie designed a ruby ring to mark the occasion. Through the years, he designed six more rings for Christy. A subplot of the story is Jack's brother Eli's gambling addiction. Through the years Jackie enabled Eli, and Eli lost his job with the family jewelry firm. Many narrations of important games are scattered through the novel. Hal Chase's improprieties with gambling, Black Sox Scandal of 1919, the Fred Merkel mistake during a pennant chase,and manager John McGraw's dictatorial running of the NY Giants grace this novel.

This book is not only about the depiction of a great athlete, nor of his introverted brilliance, it's a novel about fandom. The main character keeps his admiration of Mathewson at a distance, shirking any opportunities to meet him personally, but rather admire him for how he plays the game. The novel brings back a simpler time when a ballplayer was merely a ballplayer, and not subjected to the monolithic expectations of role model and media darling (although one sees the portents). The maddening enthusiasm of John J McGraw is captured here, too, and the politics of baseball's only lasting schism.
