{"ratings": 3042, "userreviews": [{"userName": "Betsy", "userReviewDate": "Aug 31, 2017", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/221050-betsy", "userReview": "Sometimes its easy to forget in the midst of all those picture books about farting dogs, night kitchens, and giant dance parties that initially literature for children had a primary purpose: To instruct. Specifically, to instill in young people a clear-cut sense of right and wrong. Learning to read was all well and good, but what\u2019s the point if you can\u2019t impart some wisdom of the elders along the way? And before you start feeling so superior in your 21st century fancypants, I would remind you that picture books do it to varying degrees of success to this very day. I\u2019ll put it another way. When a celebrity wants to write a picture book what do they do every single time? That\u2019s right, they moralize. They moralize the crap out of their books until the parent forced to read that dreck feels as though someone has clubbed them over the head with a 40-pound hammer. Even the best picture book authors and illustrators have their off books too. They might be brilliant but occasionally the point of the book feels downright clunky. Now I love me my Dan Santat, but the man is human. Some of his books I\u2019ve felt were the bee\u2019s knees and others struck me as in need of more work. After the Fall could have gone either way with me, particularly as it has a very key message at its core. That\u2019s the thing about morals, though. When the right author/illustrator finds the right story at the right time, the final products don\u2019t just fly. They soar.Nobody enjoys falling off a wall. Entirely aside from the physical trauma, there are deep psychological scars that take much longer to heal. Humpty Dumpty is a plainspoken fellow. As it puts it, falling off the wall was an accident, \u201cBut it changed my life.\u201d No longer able to deal with heights, the things he used to enjoy (like bird watching) are difficult in the face of his fears. One day, a paper airplane gives him an idea on how to get a new lease on life. But, as Humpty puts it, \u201caccidents happen.\u201d And sometimes the worst accident can lead to the spit, fire, and raw determination you need to get back in the game.And now a bit of a confession. This entire review is predicated on a lie. Well . . . not the whole review. But if you know my reviews then you know that a lot of the time I begin them with protestations. \u201cI don\u2019t like dog books but . . .\u201d, \u201cI have a low cute threshold, but . . .\u201d, and (most egregiously), \u201cI don\u2019t much care for didactic picture books, but . . .\u201d Under normal circumstances that last caveat would have been practically the first sentence in this review. Either that or I would have begun by explaining how I came to discover this book in the first place. That I didn\u2019t go either of those routes can mean only one thing \u2013 I have inside information about this book. So, to lay it on the line, I saw Dan Santat present this book at a library conference this past summer. Now lest you think I get overly gaga in the presence of authors and artists, a lot of my library conferences consist of listening to creative folks speak at lunches, dinners, panels, interviews, etc. Dan\u2019s no different, but when he told the story about the story behind this book I suddenly found myself seeing it in an entirely new light. You see, someone very close to Dan has suffered from anxiety for a very long time. This book is dedicated to that person because of the struggle Dan has seen firsthand. Look at the book that way and things begin to click in place.Many's the time I\u2019ve seen adults tackle adult themes in a picture book format and bog down as a result. When it works, it works brilliantly. Other times it feels like grown-up issues dumbed down or watered down so that they\u2019ll be \u201ckid-friendly\u201d. These books have very little to say to actual children and a lot to their fellow adults. Just because Dan wrote a book with adult anxiety in mind, that wouldn\u2019t necessarily mean that kids would care two bits about it. Fortunately, anxiety is a condition that translates well to a younger literary form. Kids are anxious creatures. Recently my daughter was simultaneously anxious that she\u2019d burn her corneas out looking at the sun during an eclipse and worried that she\u2019d miss it entirely. The fact that Santat chose the Humpty Dumpty nursery rhyme as a starting point is inspired. Pages like the one where Humpty says that after his accident, \u201cThere were some parts that couldn\u2019t be healed with bandages and glue\u201d can be understood by children and adults alike, without sacrificing any of that essential child-friendliness that will keep the book accessible. On top of that, Dan works in that age-old dictum to face and overcome your fears without bludgeoning you with it. And though as a parent I should have seen the end coming, it turned out to be a delightful surprise for everyone in my family.The writing. Let\u2019s talk about the writing. I\u2019ve written a picture book or two before because of that experience I can now tell that the best ones out there keep the ideas short, succinct, and to the point (clearly not my own personal strength). You can fill your pages with extra literary doodads and folderols but just know that at the end of the day a true picture book doesn\u2019t need excess. Reading this book I could almost imagine Mr. Santat with a paring knife in one hand, ready to cut out any fat or needless jibber jabbering that snuck into his manuscript. This isn\u2019t to say that there aren\u2019t pages that contain up to seven sentences, but they lay the groundwork. For the most part Santat limits himself to the right words at the right time. If you think there\u2019s a lot of white space in this book you aren\u2019t wrong. Just don\u2019t go thinking that the author sacrificed anything essential when he made these cuts. With brevity he slices right to the heart of what he\u2019s trying to convey to kids and they get it, man. They get it.Santat won a Caldecott for the picture book  Beekle not too long ago. A perfectly fine book with an art style similar to that found in After the Fall. Personally I liked Beekle but was never quite as enthralled with it as some folks. I happen to consider this latest book Santat\u2019s best work visually. When critiquing a picture book for its art, you go about it two ways: First you consider the images in the book individually and then you consider how well they work together as a whole. I can\u2019t do that with you here. Not thoroughly. Instead, let\u2019s just take a single example of a moment in the book. In this story Humpty has at last constructed the perfect bird-shaped paper airplane as a kind of avatar, going where he cannot. Now consider the three page turns that go from a two-page close-up on Humpty\u2019s horrified visage as he watches his beloved paper bird soar to the precise location he\u2019s been trying to avoid. A turn of the page and we get this rather remarkable shot of Humpty\u2019s head sticking out in the middle of the left-hand page while the wall, ladder, and bird are equally sideways, born out of the right-hand side of the right page. Another page turn and the angle has shifted yet again. We\u2019re at the top of the ladder on the wall looking down at a thoroughly pissed off Humpty. Look at where the white pace moves in these three sequences. Upper half of the page \u2013 left-hand side \u2013 lower half (where the wall is). This is just one example but as I read the book through a couple times I noticed these very thoughtful choices on the part of the artist. Things like the fact that it isn\u2019t until Humpty makes his airplane that we get close to him. Before that moment we see him pretty much at a distance. And there are other artistic choices hidden, like the fact that when Humpty experiences his final transforation we never see his face, or the casual inclusion of street and business signs in the town that are in languages other than English. But you sort of have to take the book as a whole.If someone asked me to do an elevator pitch for this book in one sentence I guess I\u2019d be forced to say something about how it encourages readers to get up again after they fail or get hurt or have some sort of challenge in their life that they need to overcome. That sort of makes the book sound overly simplified, though. I think what Santat\u2019s managed here is something very deft and fleet of foot. This could be an inspirational picture book that people hand to graduates or adults that have suffered some kind of a trauma, no question. But its primary purpose is to speak to children, even if those kids can\u2019t entirely understand what it is that it\u2019s trying to say. There\u2019s no getting around its message. The question you have to ask yourself then is, would you want to?For ages 4 and up."}, {"userName": "David Schaafsma", "userReviewDate": "Nov 20, 2017", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/269235-david-schaafsma", "userReview": "Each year my family reads all the Goodreads-award-nominated picture books, and we have been doing this for years.

This book lifted my heart up. What happens after Humpty Dumpty fell off that wall. Well he was put back together and he became afraid. When he was on the wall, he was in the light. Now he lived in the shadows of the wall. He missed the light and the birds. Eventually, he builds a paper airplane and flies it. It lands on top of the wall in the light. So goes after it and transforms like a caterpillar into a bird free to fly. He can once again be free in the world of light. This book is amazing! I LOVE the artwork. The isle with the cereal boxes was astounding. So much put into so little. You really must read this if you enjoy children's books. This is an astounding read.

However, as I had After the Fall downloaded on my Ipad and was not in the mood last night to continue reading the Thomas Mann novel I had started on Monday, I decided to try After the Fall and see what my own, what my personal reaction would be. And while I have (once again) not found Dan Santat's illustrations all that much to my aesthetic tastes, both images and accompanying narrative have I gess to a point been entertaining and diverting enough for a quick five minute prerusal. However and truth be told, the rather thickly and preachily presented messages of getting up again after adversity, of overcoming fears and spreading one's proverbial wings to fly and soar once again are far too unsubtle and overtly plastered for me to truly enjoy After the Fall without major reservations (and yes indeed, even if I had had After the Fall read to me as a young child, I defnitely or at least very likely would have also felt that Dan Santat's printed words, while certainly encouraging and empowering are also much too lesson-like and educational to be a completely enjoyable and pleasureable reading experience, with the ending in particular also a bit strange and difficult to comprehend and appreciate for a child of the picture book age group). And thus, only two and a half stars for After the Fall (and while I originally had indeed planned to round up to three stars, I have now decided to keep my rating at two stars, mostly because I have read far too many unsubtly preachy picture books in recent months and am feeling both curmudgeonly and majorly sermonised-out so to speak)."}, {"userName": "Pamela", "userReviewDate": "Nov 30, 2017", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/20048096-pamela", "userReview": "Aww....

I admit that makes me feel a little bad about doing this, but I can't really change my opinion because others felt differently.I purchased this book after seeing it nominated for Best Picture Book as part of the goodreads Choice Awards 2017. I liked the concept, I liked the idea and my kid loves Humpty Dumpty so I thought it would be such fun reading this with him. Unfortunately, I was disappointed by the quality of the book in general. The illustrations seemed amateur, the printing seemed of low quality, the colors and the general look and feel lacked greatly. I'm not usually picky about these sorts of things, but given that this is a picture book, the quality of pictures and illustrations is a huge part that needs to be reviewed. The message behind the story was nice and sweet, but I'm not sure about the ending, so does he fall and gets broken into pieces again? Did he not learn his lesson then? Was he not more careful second time around? It took him a while to get over his fear, only to go through the same thing? That part was a little confusing. All in all, not what I expected.

He is well known due to a popular nursery rhyme. Santat added more to the story by incorporating what Humpty Dumpty learned from the fall.The King's men were able to put Humpty Dumpty back together again but there were wounds that didn't heal. These invisible wounds such as being afraid of heights took awhile for Humpty Dumpty to overcome. It became so apparent that he couldn't even enjoy some of his favorite things anymore. Humpty Dumpty tries alternatives to still enjoy his favorite things but eventually he had to overcome his fear in order to persevere. Santat teaches little ones and pretty much anyone who reads the After The Fall that everyone can overcome their fears. If a fear is interfering with you enjoying a favorite thing, one must overcome that fear. Also, Santat discusses about accidents and how accidents happen. One must learn how to adjust if an accident occurs. Sometimes you will need to overcome a fear as an result of an accident aftermath. It's okay to be nervous and terrified. It's okay to be worried and thinking you might not make it. Just keep moving one step at a time toward to goal. Taking baby steps will help achieve a goal with less fear. Santat's illustrations are remarkably wonderful! The timeless muted color palette reminds me of Mike Curato's Little Elliot, Big City. The ending was unexpected but it works beautifully with the motto of the book. The dust jacket has the title of the book in a raised semi-spot glossed type while the rest of the cover is matte. Humty Dumpty sitting on a while is also semi-spot glossed. Removing the dust jacket reveals a wonderful illustration of Humpty Dumpty falling with from the sky. Birds and a pair of binoculars are seen in the sky.After the Fall is a wonderful inspirational book for all ages. It's the type of book that will help readers feel at ease when they make mistakes. This is a classic story about overcoming fears when you are afraid.

Still, I love the unexpected and moving ending.Finally, the cereal aisle spread annoys me a little: the \u201cfun\u201d cereal on the top shelf, which Humpty Dumpty cannot reach because of his fear of heights, are all sugary, while the \u201cboring\u201d cereal on the bottom are mostly healthy.
