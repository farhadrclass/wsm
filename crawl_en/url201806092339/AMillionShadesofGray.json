Absolutely brilliant.I have been going through the reviews to see if anybody read between the lines as I did, and from the few I've read it doesn't seem like it. Perhaps I'm reading too much into it, but this is what I've noticed:Tomas = Foreign InterferenceY'Tin - South or North VietnamY'Juen - South or North VietnamThe relationship between the three change drastically as they travel through the jungle. Y'Juen and Y'Tin grew up together, best friends, etc. They even escape the village with each others help. When they meet Tomas, who is older than both of them and Y'Tin's teacher, they are suddenly split into two teams. Y'Juen and Tomas become a 'we', as Y'Tin puts it, and it takes all of Y'Tin's self control not rise to their goading. The life-long friendship between Y'Tin and Y'Juen draws to an abrupt close - similar, it would seem, to the relationship between South Vietnam and North Vietnam did, when foreign meddling (the 'Tomas' here) placed them at loggerheads.As Y'Tin's father says, his choice to help the Americans 'crossed a line' and he can't go back on it. That is, the north and south, once whole, crossed a line when they went to war with each other. Thankfully, in the case of Vietnam, they've fared much better than most countries that have been divided and made enemy to each other by foreign instigators - they're one again, but they crossed a line, and reading this book has actually made me interested in the relations between the North and South now that the war is well behind them - is the brotherhood they may have once had now lost forever?These have been entirely my own observations from reading the story. If it was the writer's intention to subtly create these parallels then she has done so quite brilliantly. As for the character Y'Tin - he is written as more of an objective observer than an actual child-victim of war. This further convinces me that this book serves better as a commentary on war than a story of war.I would have gladly given this book five stars but a line in the closing pages irked me:  In the novel, the characters often comment on the promise the Americans made with the Dega: to return and help with the war if the North Vietnamese violated the Paris Peace Accords. Sadly the promise the was never fulfilled... The US Special Forces did honour their relation-ship with the Dega in another way....Erm... no. I'm sorry, the only way you 'honour' a relationship is by keeping the promise you made to them. There is no way to sugarcoat betrayal. Fun Fact: The way I came across this book is a bit of a story: I was discussing with a friend what would she think that other, undeservedly popular book with 'shades of grey' in the title was about if she didn't already know. \"A story about elephants,\" was one of the answers. Later, I came across this book. I told her about it and we had a good laugh. Then I saw it at the Library, and I borrowed it for kicks. Turned out to be quite an interesting story."}, {"userName": "Meredith", "userReviewDate": "Oct 18, 2010", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/71647-meredith", "userReview": "This book was so bad on so many levels that I don't even know where to start.The story revolves around a Rhade boy named Y'Tin, who lives in the Vietnamese jungle in the mid 1970s. He is obsessed with elephants and his only desire is to be an elephant handler. Unfortunately, the war disrupts the quiet in his peaceful village, which is targeted because they had previously played host to American soldiers.The plot was trying to cover so many different things--family, community, war, childhood, elephants, tribal life--that none of those aspects was covered in sufficent detail. The book reads like an endless stream of tangents and non-sequiturs.The main character, Y'Tin, had an unrealistic ability to be skilled at everything. He was an elephant handler/huntsman/tracker/escape artist who barely slept or ate, and aside from a few cuts and bruises, never took any real damage. Now, remember when, as a child, you'd play with friends and they'd pick up their doll or action figure and declare, \"This is [insert name]. He can fly, walk on lava, swim underwater forever and has magical skin that deflects bullets\" and then you'd be annoyed because that would make the game both unfair and boring? That is how I felt about the kid in this story.Also, for all the effort that was spent trying to cram several different topics into such a short book, it bored me at a level I have not experienced since I read \"The Scarlet Letter.\" It was incredibly repetitive, and if you read a sentence aloud from the book, I wouldn't even be able to tell you which part of the story it was from.Finally, what was up with the ending? Y'Tin reaches the refugee camp, (that would have been a good place to end) then leaves to rescue his friend and returns successful, (that also would have been a good place to end) and then rediscovers his elephant and her new baby (which also would have been a good ending place.) Instead of just wrapping it up at any of these places, the story had Y'Tin wandering off into the jungle and hanging out with his elephant for a week, doing nothing. Then he decides to go to Thailand, the end. Wait--what?If anyone really enjoyed this book and hates me just a little bit more now, sorry 'bout that."}, {"userName": "Yasmin", "userReviewDate": "May 17, 2012", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/7179050-yasmin", "userReview": "*SPOILER ALERT*A Million Shades of Gray by Cynthia Kadohata is the touching story of an elephant handler, Y\u2019Tin\u2019s life during the Vietnam war.For young Y\u2019Tin, war was all that ever happened. There had been a war raging during his entire life. Even so, the war had always seemed far away from his peaceful village in South Vietnam. All until one frightful day when Y\u2019Tin, his friends and village are captured by the North Vietnamese. Y\u2019Tin is separated from his beloved elephant, Lady, and his family.

Will Y\u2019Tin survive the Vietnam war and get reunited with his family and friends?I didn\u2019t find this book very interesting. The characters\u2019 personalities were very well described, but their appearances were not very clear. My favorite characters were Lady and Y\u2019Tin\u2019s father. I liked Lady because she changed throughout the story and added some exciting and interesting scenes to the plot which set up some complicating events. I liked Y\u2019Tin\u2019s father as he was mysterious and a little guarded which made me want to know more about him. His personality was described very well and throughout the story, I got to know him like a friend. Two scenes which I enjoyed were the scenes of Y\u2019Tin\u2019s capture and escape. I enjoyed the capture because it was surprising and shocking. I could understand and feel everything which Y\u2019Tin was feeling. The scene was well described and I could follow everything which was happening. I liked the scene of the escape as it was intoxicating and gripping. I could picture exactly where and what was happening. to Y\u2019Tin. While reading it, i felt tense and full of anxiety.I think that this book was okay. The scenes and characters were well described.

However, I do not think either of those qualities of the book lived up to my expectations. The plot and character development are scant--even for a novel of only 200 pages. I really wanted to connect with Y'Tin, the main character. I wanted to feel his anger and resentment toward the American soldiers who left his village in such a vulnerable situation; his anxiety and fear of the impending North Vietnamese invasion that would force him to abandon his village, his family and his beloved elephant, Lady, and flee into the jungle; his perplexity and confusion at being ostracized by his closest friends and abandoned by Lady. But Kadohata never fully fleshes out these emotions. It was if this novel was pushed through a brief publication schedule with little or no thought to editing--as the egregious errors in spelling of characters' names can attest. Kadohata also had a chance to make a pointed statement about the American involvement in Vietnam--a subject that modern YA readers, including myself, undoubtedly know little about--but she tiptoes around it. I still don't know her stance on the subject... just as I don't know who Y'Tin truly was as a character or what the message of this book was."}, {"userName": "Molly", "userReviewDate": "Feb 08, 2017", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/61579866-molly", "userReview": "I recently read a book \"A Million Shades of Gray\" by Cynthia Kadohata.

I thought this book was very powerful because it showed me how much I take for granted every day. I would rate this book 8.

This book, however, is much more effective and interesting. It explores a part of the Viet Nam War that we do not see in print and it asks readers difficult and important questions: How did the United States convince tribal people to help them? Why did the United States abandon the Dega people who had helped them? It also is filled with well-researched historical facts about World War II and the Dega people.

I rally liked it but I feel like she was trying to make it really short but it really should have been more stretched out at parts and it has just to much emotion in one spot so that if you miss it you don't get any. At least that is how I saw it because I really would have absoulutly loved it if she had maybye evn a bit less feeling and longer. SO I feel like it is the opposite of The Secret Keepers, like there was to many stertched out parts and here it is way different. It would have definitly have had an honarary spot in my IMPACT shelf but I just got so confusd and the parts where there was a bunch of French and Veitnamese and it wasn't translated made the book really confusing and I felt like I was missing a lot. It makes me really sad because I know she cannot just republish it and it would be so much better if she had just made it a bit less confusing. I loved it but I feel like I didn't get it when I wish I did. It is placed in a really important time period, war and historical moments are packed it there but I feel like it is so packed that I couldn't reach through and grab emotion and at the same time I feel like she did not really grasp the true way a kid's mid works. I really was dissapointed there because no kid really thinks that way. So I gave it a three because I know its potential but I don't feel like I captured and feeling (love, anger, hatred, madness, frusteration) from the charecter. It reallly makes me sad though because it could be at the Newbary Medal stage and all that but she just I think got confused on this one. Also the charecters didn't feel realistic to me. They didn't because no person is always right. No one thinks for 2 years about something. She really treid hard to I think capture their way of thinking but they are not like a different species. She didn't quite capture the spirts paart eaither. I personally am not Vietnamese but I feel thats not what they think about spirits and why they like spirits and believe in them. I also from his point of veiw did not think that that is the way the human mind works. I am more than 100 percent sure of that.

Set soon after the Americans pull out of the Vietnam War in 1975, the Vietcong and the North Vietnamese are still soldiering in to combat the Southern Vietnamese, breaking the established Paris Peace Accord agreement. Y'Tin's village is ambushed, threatening the lives of many; most are held captive or killed. Y'Tin's father urges him to run for his life, to lead him and his friends with their elephants far into the jungle to escape the threat of war and the rain of destruction coming their way.Three boys and their elephants grow up quick as the art of jungle survival has them learning to track and hunt for food, find shelter, and watching for signs of the enemy. Friends become enemies, childhood brothers turn to betrayal. The other boys abandon Y'Tin as he insists on staying with Lady temporarily in the wild as she joins a wild herd, bonding with them to ensure safety of her unborn calf. Y'Tin's sorrow of the loss of Lady runs deep but as boy becomes man he knows in his heart it is right to let her go free. Leaving her safe, away from harm, Y'Tin spends days in the heat of the jungle, bleeding from wounds, dying of thirst and hunger, and yet his talented tracking skills pay off as he winds his way back finding his family alive. But rest is not in the cards for our young hero, the boy who betrayed him has been missing for days and his family begs Y'Tin to return to the jungle once again to find him, dead or alive. The character of Y'Tin is both innocent and playful as he shows us his love for Lady and as he dreams of starting his own elephant training school someday in far off Thailand. Yet he also reveals to us that he is strong in body & mind when he is presented with challenges both bold and brave.I loved this precious and poignant story and feel it would give young boys an adventure tale filled with heroic action they can relate to. However, I was a bit at odds with the conflicting writing style Kadohata pens. The level of writing is for that of an 8-10 year old boy, very simplistic and matter of fact. But the content of the story with its bloodshed and heinous acts of war, along with the difficult scenarios that Y'Tin must endure as he continually beats the odds when death is at his every door, was a bit heavy and serious for the writing ability level. This is an excellent book, but I do caution parents to use judgment as they consider the content for the younger readers; there are a few graphic scenes presented that paint a very vivid picture of the horrors of the Vietnam War"}, {"userName": "Bernie Gourley", "userReviewDate": "Feb 28, 2015", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/6423134-bernie-gourley", "userReview": "This young adult (YA) novel is set in the Central Highlands of Vietnam during the last few years of the war. The lead character, Y\u2019tin, is an adolescent whose life ambition is to be an elephant handler, a dream which he\u2019s well on the way to achieving and which he\u2019d be a shoe in for if he didn\u2019t live in war-torn times. His life is complicated by the fact that his father has worked for the American Special Forces (as a tracker), and the war is turning in the favor of the North.When US forces withdraw and South Vietnamese forces are overrun, Y\u2019tin escapes into the jungle with a couple of other boys and their elephants. Almost immediately a fault line freezes out Y\u2019tin. The three boys had been close friends in the village, but under the stress of jungle life, the other two resent that Y\u2019tin\u2019s father worked for US Special Forces and that Y\u2019tin, himself, had once gone on mission with the Americans. They believe that this is what has brought the war to their village. On the other hand, they recognize that Y\u2019tin is more gifted in jungle craft than they, especially tracking, because of the education of his father. Because of these skills, Y\u2019tin is chosen to go back on a mission to reconnoiter their village, and he finds it\u2019s been bombed out and nobody is to be seen. This leaves it unclear how many of the villagers escaped versus being executed by the North Vietnamese forces\u2014but he does know many were killed. [Incidentally, the title comes from Y\u2019tin\u2019s view of the jungle after seeing the remnants of his village\u2014i.e. instead of being a million shades of green, all he can see is gray.]Besides telling the story of Y\u2019tin\u2019s adventures in surviving the war, the novel pivots on Y\u2019tin\u2019s role as a mahout\u2014and ultimately as a protector of the elephants. Y\u2019tin finds himself in a position in which his dream is no longer tenable, and he must decide whether take a heroic risk to save the elephants or hold on to his dream in the face of unfavorable odds. The book is only a little over 200 pages arranged into 14 chapters, and\u2014as would be expected of YA fiction\u2014is readable. The book\u2019s strength is in building a lead character who\u2019s interesting by virtue of his mix of worldly naivet\u00e9 and jungle [local] wisdom and giving him intense challenges and dilemmas. Weakness? The strict chronological progression results in a slow start in which the author spends a chapter establishing that the lead character loves elephants without anything interesting happening. However, if one gives the book til the second chapter, things start happening. I\u2019d recommend this book for readers of fiction, and particularly those interested in YA fiction and stories of war."}, {"userName": "mitchell k dwyer", "userReviewDate": "Jun 09, 2010", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/632763-mitchell-k-dwyer", "userReview": "I didn't know there were tribal agrarian peoples in Vietnam who were not officially involved in the war. I don't think I'm especially ignorant about these things, so I admit I was surprised to learn about the Rhade people, a tribe in the southern part of that country, some of whom helped American Special Forces to navigate the Vietnam jungles.This is the best thing Cynthia Kadohata's A Million Shades of Gray has going for it. The story of Y'Tin, a young elephant handler who longs to quit school so that he may pursue his dream of training other elephant handlers, is a glimpse at a culture I was completely unaware of. After the signing of the 1973 Paris Peace Accords, the Americans leave a Vietnam that is divided North and South, assuring the Rhade that if the armies of the North should aggressively move into the South, they will return to help. Y'Tin is the youngest elephant handler his village has ever seen. Although he is a talented tracker and his father is a successful tobacco farmer, elephants are his passion and he is sure he will spend the rest of his life caring for them. But the northern armies are moving south, and the Americans don't seem to be coming back. Y'Tin is worried about what his village will do in response as his way of life and the survival of his people are thrown into jeopardy.It's an interesting story, but largely unsatisfying. Y'Tin's character is rather shallowly defined, and although Kadohata's descriptions of everyday life in his village are interesting, her story feels flat and it doesn't resolve well. I am currently a few chapters into Kadohata's \nWeedflower\n, and already it has the deep, poetic, heartbreaking beauty I remember from her Newbery-winning \nKira-Kira\n. A Million Shades of Gray lacks that depth, and although it's a pretty good read, it's fair to call this one a mild disappointment."}, {"userName": "Ellory Liles", "userReviewDate": "Feb 22, 2017", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/59177281-ellory-liles", "userReview": "This book was a very heartwarming story.

Cynthia Kadohata takes us back to a time in Vietnam just a couple of years after American involvement in the war ended. Thirteen-year-old Y'Tin comes from a privileged family living in a remote village in southern Vietnam, and he holds the distinction of being the youngest elephant handler in his village's history. Y'Tin's ties with Lady, his elephant who was named by an American, run very deep. This connection becomes a major factor when the forces of northern Vietnam find Y'Ting's village and begin to attack his people, killing his friends and neighbors as if their lives didn't matter at all. Prior to this point the action in the book is actually fairly slow-paced, but when Y'Ting escapes from where the survivors of his village are being held by the enemy forces, the narrative suddenly becomes swallowed in tight suspense. Y'Ting and his two friends must find their way through the stultifying Vietnam jungles to an oasis of safety, all while Y'Ting is trying his best to care for his elephant Lady, who is expecting a baby at any time.A Million Shades of Gray is a book that has some excellent characters that really grab a hold of the reader's thoughts. Y'Ting's sojourn is an emotionally confusing one for him; he is coming of age during the horrific tumult of civil war, and he hardly knows anymore what way is up in his own life.  This is a book with few answers, simple or otherwise. It feels very real, though, not at all like your typical story, and brings texture to a place and time that isn't often seen in American literature, and even less often in juvenile novels. Cynthia Kadohata has done a good job of creating a solid story, and I might give it two and a half stars."}, {"userName": "Judith", "userReviewDate": "Apr 13, 2010", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/3535005-judith", "userReview": "In Cynthia Kadohata\u2019s new novel, A Million Shades of Gray, Kadohata reveals the story of Y\u2019Tin, a 13 year old boy who dreams of becoming an elephant trainer, and the hardships that he faces in his remote Southern Vietnam village. Y\u2019Tin\u2019s story takes place a few years after the Americans left South Vietnam and focuses on the trepidation and fear the villagers face. Y\u2019Tin\u2019s main focus in life is to become the youngest elephant trainer and maybe one day open his own training school. The effects of this devastating war might cause him to sacrifice his dreams when his village is attacked and his relationship with his beloved elephant, Lady, is tested. Kadohata, author of the 2005 Newbery Medal winner Kira-Kira, takes the reader on a heart wrenching ride as Y\u2019Tin must decide whether to stand with his family and neighbors or protect his beloved elephants.\tAs the story progress, the reader sees how a young innocent Y\u2019Tin is forced to realize that life is not as idyllic as he previously thought. Though the story starts out slow, the author sets the stage for the reader to understand the importance that the Americans played in the security of these remote villages and how their departure has left them vulnerable. Y\u2019Tin must rely on himself to survive in the harsh jungle after he is able to escape his captured village. This is a story of friendship, betrayal, war, family, tradition, love, but more than anything it is a coming of age story for Y\u2019Tin. Some critics believe the brutality of the Vietnam War is not appropriate for the 9 to 12 year age group that this book is recommended for. I believe A Million Shades of Gray is a great way to introduce children to this part of history. Though the author is not able to capture the same success she had with Kira-Kira, A Million Shades of Gray is an effective story to teach children about the harshness Vietnam War"}, {"userName": "Andrea Wickenhagen", "userReviewDate": "Nov 27, 2013", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/23463885-andrea-wickenhagen", "userReview": "In a small village at the heart of the Central Highlands of South Vietnam lived a boy named Y\u2019Tin Eban. The majestic animal of his people, the elephant, fascinated him. All he wanted in life was to become an elephant handle. Y\u2019Tins dreams came true when he became one of the youngest handlers among his village at age thirteen. Watching over Lady was the best part of his life, she taught him patience, responsibility, love, and friendship. The story is set back in 1975 during the time of war between the Northern Vietnamese and the Southern Vietnamese. Y\u2019Tin lived amongst the Rhade tribe one of the largest Dega tribes in Vietnam. Many men of his tribe including his father worked with American Special Forces as spies and guides throughout the jungle to help South Vietnam try to defeat the North. Life was peaceful for his tribe. They were simple farmers and hunters, out of the way of war set deep within the jungle. That is until the American troops pulled out of Southern Vietnam, and shortly after life for the Rhade trip changed. The Northern Vietnamese Army also referred to as the NVA come through and destroy the entire life Y\u2019Tin and his Rhade tribe ever knew. The book tells Y\u2019Tins unique story, as he has to overcome the deviation that the NVA brought to his tribe.

While it also teaches you the struggle the villages in southern Vietnam experienced during the war. As you follow this young man on this journey to safety you feel as if you are experiencing the struggle and heartbreak right along side him."}, {"userName": "Aiyu_Z", "userReviewDate": "Sep 18, 2016", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/59124467-aiyu-z", "userReview": "Y\u2019Tin was an 11-year-old boy who strived to become an elephant handler, who hated school and looked after his elephant Lady in his tribe Rhade remote from the worst of American War (Vietnam War from local Southern Vietnamese viewpoint). Y-Tin\u2019s father and several other tribesmen worked closely with the American Special Forces and were considered guilty by Northern Vietnamese afterward when Americans left, and Northern Vietnamese overran Y\u2019Tin\u2019s village by abusing and massacring innocent tribesmen. Forced to escape into the capricious jungle where he reunited with Lady and his friends, Y\u2019Tin gradually developed his new understanding of survival, friendship, and loyalty while discovered dimensions of hatred and anger inside himself.The author illustrates the wisdom of Y\u2019Tin\u2019s father\u2019s words---\u201c the jungle changes a man\u201d ---by developing deep into the soul of her protagonist. Following the prints left by Y\u2019Tin, readers get to comprehend complex themes, including historical background, ethnic diversity in Vietnam, Dega tribal culture, elephant handling, as well as childhood and growth, in an engaging and immersive way. Although the book might be intense for younger readers as it contains a few dimensions, the subject matter of the confusion of growing up, dealing with pains, or animal-human relations are relatable to present society. The book is a suitable choice for complementary reading for a middle-grade history class on Vietnam War. It tells the story from marginalized indigenous Vietnamese during the war and creates mirrors for Vietnamese immigrants (also other people from similar backgrounds). It dives deeper than \"5f\" to discuss Dega culture values and cultivate empathy in readers."}, {"userName": "Jenny / Wondrous Reads", "userReviewDate": "Jan 29, 2010", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/985260-jenny-wondrous-reads", "userReview": "Before reading A Million Shades of Grey, I didn't really know a lot about the Vietnam War. I didn't know the politics or reasoning behind it, or the extent of the horrors that people experienced. Kadohata ended up giving me a history lesson of sorts, and for that reason alone, I'm glad I read this book.Y'Tin's tale is one of bravery and hope, and is as much a coming of age story as it is an adventure. Nothing makes a boy grow up like being in the middle of a war and, as horrific as it is, the whole experience undoubtedly makes Y'Tin become a man. His beloved elephant, Lady, is an important part of his life, and is a constant companion to him and his family. Their bond is strong and unwavering, and is the kind that you enviously read about or see depicted in films. I never knew elephants could be so close to humans, which again just shows how much I know about this way of life.The pace of this book is quite slow and steady, with a lot of character building and scene setting. I wanted it to speed up and get going, and make me unable to put it down. It didn't do that, but it did hold my interest plot-wise. I was fascinated by the conflict between North and South Vietnam, and by the differences in the various tribes. I also now know a lot more about elephants, like the fact that their teeth grind down and they grow more!If you like your books with historical elements, strong characters and an animal that you'll fall in love with, I'd recommend A Million Shades of Grey. As well as being good for educational purposes, it's also a lesson in humanity, and what it means to survive."}, {"userName": "Thi", "userReviewDate": "Dec 08, 2014", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/18029400-thi", "userReview": "This is a terrible book. It is plain boring. The narrator's tone is flat. There is no suspense. The characters are forgettable. Even the protagonist has no special characteristics. Everything is predictable. So main character's whole world was torned apart because of the war and then he decided move to Thailand, that's it? What was the point in writing it? Oh yeah, to paint a nice picture of the Americans and maybe get some $$ for it. What pissed me off the most is not how much time I had wasted in reading this book but what is written in the author's note. She wanted to highlight how evil the Vietnam government was toward the Montagnards and how GREAT the U.S. was for allowing 9,000 Montagnards to have a better future in their country. 9,000 is such a great number? Should they earn a medal? How about the millions of people the had killed since they formed this country? Did they get punishment for that? What a joke. And why pretend that the Vietnam government doesn't torture their own people and is only discriminating the Montagnards? Why pretend that the U.S. government didn't send Japanese Americans&Immigrants to concentration camps during WWII? Why pretend the U.S. didn't have a massacre of the Native Anericans? Need I say/type more? This is sensitive subject. So MS/MRS Author, stay away from it. You are not of Vietnamese descent. You have no right to talk shit here. I suggest you stick to with what you're familiar with. It's reflected in \"Kira-Kira\" which is one of my favorite books."}], "description": "A boy and his elephant escape into the jungle when the Viet Cong attack his village immediately after the Vietnam war.", "title": "A Million Shades of Gray", "url": "http://www.goodreads.com/book/show/6261153-a-million-shades-of-gray", "average": 3.61, "cover": "https://images.gr-assets.com/books/1391968175l/6261153.jpg", "reviews": 190, "authors": [{"url": "https://www.goodreads.com/author/show/51527.Cynthia_Kadohata", "name": "Cynthia Kadohata"}], "type": ["Historical", "Animals", "Young Adult", "Historical", "War"], "outlinks": ["http://www.goodreads.com/book/show/6261153-a-million-shades-of-gray", "http://www.goodreads.com/book/show/7327840-a-million-shades-of-grey", "http://www.goodreads.com/book/show/11045888-a-million-shades-of-gray", "http://www.goodreads.com/book/show/89731.Kira_Kira", "http://www.goodreads.com/book/show/223182.Cracker_", "http://www.goodreads.com/book/show/8559036-the-thing-about-luck", "http://www.goodreads.com/book/show/224392.Weedflower", "http://www.goodreads.com/book/show/18510235-half-a-world-away"]}
