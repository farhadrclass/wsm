I always know what to expect and I know I'll never be disappointed. So it is no surprise that I Flipping Love You is Hunting at her comedic best. This rom-com is not only hysterically funny and sexy but it also has tons of heart. The characters' backstories give them a depth that makes it impossible for you not to fall in love with them. You'll laugh, you'll swoon and you'll wish you had a Pierce of your own to make your panties go *poof* because that man is all sorts of yummy!!!I loved the fiery Rian and her twin sister Marley. There's a spark in them that makes them fun and a force to be reckoned with. Rian's internal dialogue had me laughing throughout the story. She's the kind of character you'd want to be friends with in real life because she's just so real! However, not all is as perfect as it seems as Rian has ghosts from her past that have shaped her adulthood and clouded her future. Pierce was the perfect match for Rian. Aside from his stunning good looks, he's funny, suave and romantic. He's stuck in a situation he doesn't want to be in, dealing with family issues that cloud his future as well. The pull that these two have is undeniable. They are like two magnets drawn to each other, unable to stay away, creating a deliciously sexy and beautiful love story that will have readers swooning hard. Even with some large speed bumps that get in their way, they navigate through and come out on the other side with an adorably sweet HEA that was perfectly befitting of this perfect couple. While I Flipping Love You is a complete standalone, fans of Hunting's work will relish the characters from other books that make several appearances. When I realized the connections they had, I was giddy! It's not necessary to read previous books and there really are no spoilers per se for the other books but of course I do recommend them because they, too, are fabulous! If you are looking for a flirty, fun, sexy and sweet story, I Flipping Love You fits the mold perfectly. This one gets five fabulous stars from me."}, {"userName": "Cristina | CristiinaReads", "userReviewDate": "Aug 15, 2017", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/43355962-cristina-cristiinareads", "userReview": "Want to win a copy of I FLIPPING LOVE YOU? Enter the GIVEAWAY I'm hosting with SMP by clicking here.\n\u27b3Who said one cannot mix business with pleasure? Because Helena Hunting knows how to bring the comedic, extra spicy, and sexy romances that one always looks for to be swooned over\u2026\n\u27b3When it comes down to rom-com novels, Helena Hunting is absolutely the queen of them all! There is no other author out there that can truly master the ideal purpose of making the reader laugh in a romance novel, where erotic scenes can be combined together and be brought to be considered such a steamy masterpiece that you can utterly read over and over again. Rian and Pierce are two individuals that during a \u201chit-and-run\u201d accident met and the chemistry between them both is one that sparkles like a unicorn\u2019s shiny bottom, and crackles like the fireworks on the fourth of July. Their attraction to me seems like an instant one that is not like the normal smutty insta-love stories I read from AR, but Pierce and Rian definitely have those sizzling feelings that of lust, the moment they meet. Being in the environment where beaches are right around the corner for the summer, Pierce\u2014 the brother of Amalie from HOOKING UP\u2014leaves his life in Manhattan to spend the summer relaxing with the company of his brother. That\u2019s when he stumbles upon Rian, thinking that she is someone else due to a past accident that happened to his car, when in reality he got himself confused with Rian\u2019s fraternal twin sister.\u27b3As both characters quickly learn to realize the truth behind the \u201chit-and-run,\u201d Pierce and Rian constantly keep meeting in locations that are purely through fate, or like Pierce would like to say, through the idea of it being \u201ckismet.\u201d Something that I find rather romantic in every essence. Rian is a strong minded woman, with the pure love of numbers, who wants the best for herself and her sisters. When I mean \u201cthe best,\u201d I am not regarding having the best that money can buy, but simply have a stable life that does not include any sort of financial struggle. When she meets Pierce, nothing changes, things do indeed fall more into place when the coincidence of working next to him as a client becomes a puzzling dilemma but also a relief for Rian. Their attraction is one that never diminishes no matter where they are\u2014 it could be the beach, a kitchen, a near by restaurant, the outside pool of a horny old lady\u2019s house, or even the laundry room, Rian and Pierce are just the ultimate sex fiends that Helena has written. \u27b3When feelings are being added to the sexual relationship Pierce and Rian start off with, these two become one of the most complex couples I have ever read. But a realization of what is really going on is what truly brings them together as one to enlighten each other that they are just simply meant to be. Both are complete goofballs, making me wish I were Rian for the taking of being with Pierce;\n \"We\u2019re having a sleepover. We\u2019re going to do this all night, and I\u2019m going to cuddle you like a motherfucker after finishing sexing every last orgasm out of you\u2026\u201d\n\u27b3Overall, this is yet again another romance novel by the Queen Hunting that has mastered anything beyond the rom-com category. I don\u2019t just say this because she is one of my favorite authors of all time, but she just simply never seems to diminish in the charisma aspect, and also the passionate factor when it comes down to an ideal romance novel. Thank you so much to SMP for allowing me to take a part in this journey because this series is one that I'll constantly be going back to for a re-read.Amazon \u2192 http://amzn.to/2j8b9zjB&N \u2192 http://bit.ly/2Fy24fBChapters \u2192 http://bit.ly/2HVYOIyBAM \u2192 https://bit.ly/2HCUpKqIndie Bound \u2192 https://bit.ly/2GYUUiC\u27b3ARC kindly provided by SMP, in exchange for an honest review...\u27b3Follow Me On:Blog \u2655 Instagram \u2655 Facebook \u2655 Twitter"}, {"userName": "Christy", "userReviewDate": "Apr 04, 2018", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/11284813-christy", "userReview": "What can I say about this book, aside from I FLIPPING LOVED IT! Helena Hunting delivered an adorable, fun, and sexy read with I Flipping Love You. I\u2019ve enjoyed all the stand-alone novels from her \u2018Shacking Up\u2019 series, but this is my favorite so far! Pierce and Rian meet in a grocery store in the most uncanny way. Seriously- this book had me rolling with laughter from the first few chapters. There aren\u2019t many authors who can make me laugh as much as Helena Hunting can. Rian and her twin-sister are a hoot, and Pierce is a bit of an ass\u2026 at first anyways. \n\n\u201cThat asshole was hot, which are two of your favorite qualities in a man. And rich. He\u2019s a rich, hot asshole. And he thinks you\u2019re hot.\u201d\n\n\u2028As much as Rian wanted to deny it, she and Pierce had a huge connection from the very start. Their chemistry is completely undeniable. Rian is a bit on the stubborn side, though. It takes her a while to come to terms with Pierce. I could understand, after learning about her past, why she was the way she was though. Pierce was amazing. There was some push and pull between the two of them, but I wanted them together so badly.If you\u2019re looking for an entertaining, funny, light-hearted, and steamy read, pick up I Flipping Love You. Helena Hunting does not disappoint when it comes to romantic comedy!"}, {"userName": "Helena Hunting", "userReviewDate": "Apr 28, 2018", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/6015704-helena-hunting", "userReview": "Let the bed frame breaking commence!I FLIPPING LOVE YOU is LIVE! Check out chapter one :)Preorder NOW:Amazon USCA  UK AU iBooks Nook  Kobo Google PlayChapter 1Angry Hot GuyRianI flip through my stack of flyers, checking for a sale on the jumbo box of Cinnamon Toast Crunch cereal so I can price match it. I\u2019m a conscientious price matcher. I mark the sale with a big circle before tucking the red Sharpie into the front of my shirt. If I\u2019m going to wheel and deal at the cash register, I want to make it as easy as possible for the cashier and the people in line behind me. Nothing is worse than getting stuck behind an unorganized price matcher.I shimmy a little to the song playing over the store intercom as I toss boxes of my most favorite, unhealthy cereal in my cart. A prickly feeling climbs the back of my neck, and I shiver, glancing over my shoulder. A mom rushes past me down the aisle, her toddler leaning precariously out of the cart in an attempt to grab a box of Fruit Roll-Ups. I can\u2019t blame him. They are artificially delicious.But the mom-toddler combo isn\u2019t the reason for the prickly feeling. Halfway down the aisle is a suit. A big suit. Well over six feet of man wrapped in expensive charcoal-gray fabric. He doesn\u2019t have a cart or a basket. And he\u2019s staring at me. Weird. I can\u2019t look at him long enough to decide if he\u2019s familiar or not without making it obvious that I\u2019m staring back.I have the urge to check my appearance, worried I have his attention because my hair is a mess, or there\u2019s a sweat stain down the center of my back. I\u2019m not particularly appealing at the moment. I\u2019ve just come from a boot camp class at this new gym my twin sister forced me to try.Marley bought an online two-for-one coupon for forty bucks, so now I have to attend six of these stupid classes with her. I managed to get out of last week\u2019s class, but she wouldn\u2019t let me escape two weeks in a row. My tank is still dewy, post-exertion, I have terrible under-boob sweat, and my thong is all wonky. If I were alone in this aisle, I\u2019d for sure fix the last issue, but suit guy is here so I must leave the thong where it is for now, wedged uncomfortably between my vagina lips.The suit quickly shifts his attention to the shelves and picks up the jar directly in front of him, which happens to contain prunes. He inspects it, then maybe realizes what it is, because he rushes to return it, exchanging it for another item. I bite back a smile, pleased that even in my disgusting state I\u2019m being checked out.As suit man gives the shelf in front of him his full attention, I return the checkout favor. His attire and his posture scream money and a twinge of something like longing combined with jealousy makes my throat momentarily tight. At one time, price matching was a practice I would\u2019ve laughed at\u2014like an entitled jerk\u2014now it\u2019s a necessity.Suit man must be warm, considering it\u2019s late April and we\u2019re experiencing temperatures far above average for this time of year. Based on the tapered fit of his suit, I\u2019m guessing it\u2019s a high-end brand. He\u2019s complemented it with black, patent leather shoes. Very impractical for this weather and location. Does he realize he\u2019s in the Hamptons?He\u2019s wearing a watch, and from his profile, he can\u2019t be much beyond his early thirties. I have to assume the only reason for the watch is because it\u2019s expensive and he wants to show it off. In my head, I\u2019ve already profiled him as a pretentious, rich prick who probably commutes to NYC a few times a week where he bones his secretary and has a penthouse with the barest of furniture. The rest of the time he works from home.I return to shopping and continue down the aisle, in the opposite direction of the suit\u2014it\u2019s my way of finding out if he\u2019s actually creeping on me or not. I keep tabs on him in my peripheral vision as I scope out more sales and more delicious, un food items. My job is to balance out all the fruit and vegetables my sister, Marley, is currently picking out in the produce section.I grab a jar of the off-brand peanut butter since we\u2019re out and the good stuff isn\u2019t on sale, dropping it in the cart. My phone keeps buzzing in my purse. It\u2019s distracting, so I give up ignoring it and check my messages.It\u2019s my sister.We\u2019re in the same store. It\u2019s not particularly huge, so I don\u2019t know what could be so pressing that she needs to text four thousand times instead of finding me.ABORT SHOPPING LEAVE NOW Meet me in parking lot RIAN?????? Jeez. What the heck is going on? Maybe the grocery store is being robbed. Holy Hot Pockets. What if there is a grocery store heist going down? I\u2019m about to abandon my cart in a bid to find Marley and escape the mayhem I\u2019ve created in my head. It\u2019s all very dramatic. As I turn, I come face-to-face with the suit.I suck in a breath and slap my hand over my chest. The tank is still damp, and my skin\u2019s a little gritty with salt-sweat, so I drop it quickly, because ew.\u201cHi.\u201d His expression is hard to read. He seems . . . smug.\u201cHi, hey. Uh . . .\u201d I wave a hand around in the air, a little flustered, and conflicted, because it\u2019s not often I get approached by a guy this hot\u2014and in a grocery store of all places. Maybe he\u2019ll be here again next week. \u201cI\u2019m sorry, I\u2019d like to stare at your pretty face, I mean . . .\u201d Crap, why are words so hard? \u201cI have to go.\u201dI try to step around him, but he mirrors the movement, taking a linebacker stance, as if he\u2019s considering tackling me. Which is an odd way to stage an introduction.\u201cRecognize me?\u201d he asks, one perfect eyebrow archeAs I take him in, I wrack my brain for a time or place I might\u2019ve run into him before. I don\u2019t think so, though. His light brown hair is neatly styled, and the cut of his suit highlights all of his assets. Well, the visible PG ones, anyway.He widens his stance and crosses his arms over his chest. His very broad chest. The sleeves of his suit jacket pull tight, biceps bulging and flexing. He\u2019s a bit intimidating based on his size alone, but we\u2019re in a public grocery store, so I feel relatively safe. And he\u2019s just so gorgeous. Which is a silly reason not to be concerned, some of the most notorious serial killers are attractive men. Also, I need to find my sister, in case the grocery store is really under attack\u2014although maybe this suit could save us.I adopt his crossed arm pose, but I don\u2019t think I look intimidating. All I succeed in doing is awkwardly squeezing my boobs together inside my damp sports bra and jabbing the right one with the Sharpie. \u201cShould I?\u201dHe looks me over, a slight smirk tipping his mouth. His gaze gets stuck on the Sharpie for a few seconds before they come back up to my eyes.It\u2019s possible I met him in a bar, but I swear I\u2019d remember his face if I did. The bar scene is also more my sister\u2019s speed than it is mine. Oh God. It\u2019s also possible he\u2019s mistaking me for her. It\u2019s happened before.While we look nearly identical at first to most people, we\u2019re actually fraternal twins. After a few interactions, most people can tell us apart. I have a distinctive Marilyn Monroe mole on the right side above my lip, and my eyes are amber, where Marley\u2019s are closer to green. My mouth is too big for my face, my lips a little too full and my nose too small. At least that\u2019s my perception. Marley\u2019s also the more outgoing of the two of us and an inch taller. And about ten pounds lighter.Marley is a little less cautious than I am with men, so there have been a few uncomfortable occasions where her previous hookups have approached me, asking why I haven\u2019t returned their calls. It\u2019s too bad if this is the case, because this guy is inordinately attractive and it would be nice if he wasn\u2019t one of my sister\u2019s castoffs.His face is a masterpiece of masculine perfection; straight nose, high cheekbones, an angular jawline that could cut glass, full lips. Especially the bottom one. The kind of full that makes me think of kissing, with tongue, of course. He\u2019s all-American handsome with a shot of alpha hotness. It\u2019s a lethal combination for the state of my already damp panties.\u201cI recognize you.\u201d He has a low, rough voice, like the delicious scrape of fine grit sandpaper.He breaks me out of my ogle daze. He must think I\u2019m Marley. I\u2019m actually rather disappointed. \u201cI think maybe you\u2019ve mistaken me for someone else.\u201d\u201cOh no, sweetheart.\u201d His gaze rakes over me again. I feel very naked all of a sudden. And hot. It\u2019s really hot in here. \u201cYou drive a powder-blue Buick.\u201d\u201cHow the heck\u2014\u201d\u201cI knew it!\u201d he shouts, eyes alight with some kind of weird, victorious satisfaction as he points a long finger with a blue-black nail at me. Maybe he slammed it in a door or something. Or based on the way he\u2019s rudely pointing, maybe someone slammed it for him. \u201cI fucking knew it! You hit my car.\u201dI definitely would\u2019ve remembered hitting someone\u2019s car, especially if a guy this good looking was driving it. He should probably come with a warning, like: Panties may combust if you get too close, or something. I take a step back since he\u2019s all up in my grill and clearly he\u2019s not looking to flirt like I originally thought. \u201cI have absolutely no idea what you\u2019re talking about.\u201d\u201cDon\u2019t play dumb with me! You think you can flip your ponytail\u201d\u2014he reaches out and flicks the end, which is rather startling\u2014\u201cflash a smile and some cleavage, and it\u2019s going to get you out of this. Well, think again, sweetheart. I guarantee my paint is still all over your bumper.\u201d He\u2019s leaning over me, face way too close to mine. So close I can see tiny gold flecks in his deep green eyes. They\u2019re an unusual shade. Dark like pine tree needles.And he\u2019s chewing gum. Juicy Fruit. I can smell it when he breathes in my face. I would\u2019ve expected a man like him to chew something more along the lines of Polar Ice, or \u2014strong mint.I put a hand on his chest and take one deliberate step backwards as he opens his mouth to resume his tangent. It\u2019s a solid chest. Extremely hard. His gaze darts down, brows furrowed. I use his distracted state to my advantage. \u201cFirst of all . . .\u201d I point my finger in his face, like he did to me. \u201cDon\u2019t \u2018sweetheart\u2019 me. That\u2019s condescending. Secondly, I\u2019m sure I would\u2019ve noticed if I\u2019d hit another car. Thirdly, there are literally hundreds of powder-blue Buicks in this stupid city. It\u2019s not an uncommon car. And I\u2019d like to point out, that the cleavage comment was completely unnecessary and unwarranted and actually, pretty damn sexist.\u201dHe blinks a couple of times, possibly taken aback. That expression doesn\u2019t last long. His lip curls in a sneer and that pretty all-American handsomeness morphs into downright malevolent hotness. \u201cNice try, sweetheart. But there\u2019s no way I\u2019d forget you.\u201d His gaze sweeps over me\u2014it\u2019s not in an unappreciative way either.I poke his hard chest. \u201cStop leering at me, you pervert. I don\u2019t know what kind of drugs you\u2019ve been snorting, but I assure you, you\u2019ve got the wrong person.\u201d\u201cOh shit!\u201d my sister\u2019s voice comes from behind me.I turn to find Marley doing an about-face, and then she breaks into a little grapevine step as she moves back toward me. Her eyes are wide, mouth contorted into some kind of grimace as she grabs my wrist.\u201cWhat the fuck? There are two of you?\u201d hot-crazy guy asks, eyes bouncing between us.\u201cWe gotta go.\u201d Marley latches onto my hand and drags me down the aisle, away from crazy-hot suit.\u201cWhoa! Wait a damn second!\u201dHot suit makes a grab for me, but Marley yanks me out of the way and shoves my shopping cart at him\u2014hard. He\u2019s not quite quick enough to get out of the way, and the corner of the cart slams right into his crotch. He doubles over with a groan and aggressively pushes the cart aside. It ricochets into a display of canned peaches, which spill into the aisle with a deafening crash.\u201cWhat the heck, Mar?\u201d\u201cCome the fuck on!\u201d She sprints down the aisle, dragging me behind her. I\u2019d protest, but I don\u2019t think I have much choice in the matter, considering the death grip she has on my hand, or the fact that she\u2019s assaulted the sexy-crazy suit with my shopping cart.Marley fast-walks to the exit, glancing over her shoulder. \u201cAct natural.\u201d\u201cWill you tell me what\u2019s going on? Who is that guy?\u201dShe flips her hair over her shoulder and smiles as we pass the cashiers and the automatic doors open. Marley fast-walks down the sidewalk toward our car. \u201cI may have tapped that guy\u2019s car last Saturday when I was shopping.\u201dI stop walking, which brings her to a jarring halt. She yanks on my arm. \u201cSeriously, come on. I\u2019ll explain when we\u2019re in the car.\u201d\u201cNope. No way. You explain now.\u201dHer eyes are bouncing all over the place. \u201cIt\u2019s not a big deal. I just grazed his bumper.\u201d Marley spin and tries to push me forward from behind. \u201cNow let\u2019s get out of here before he finds us again. We should probably shop somewhere else for a while.\u201dI stumble forward a step and then spin away from her. \u201cYou hit that guy\u2019s car?\u201d\u201cIt was more of a graze. At least I think it was.\u201d She wrings her hands and makes her oh crap face.Now crazy-hot suit guy seems a lot less crazy and much more justified in his reaction. Except for the cleavage comment. That was still unnecessary. \u201cIt sure didn\u2019t seem like nothing with the way he freaked out in there.\u201d\u201cHe\u2019s probably overreacting. Where are your keys?\u201d She\u2019s still wringing her hands.I pat my hip with the intention of keeping my purse safe and away from my sister. Except all I end up patting is my actual hip. I look down, running my hands over my stomach, searching for the cheap, faux-leather knockoff. \u201cOh fudge.\u201d\u201cWhat?\u201d\u201cMy purse. It\u2019s in the cart. I have to go back and get it.\u201dMarley grabs the back of my tank. \u201cYou can\u2019t! What if he\u2019s still in there?\u201d\u201cIt has my identification in it, Marley. And my bankcards, and my money, and keys to the car and the apartment. I can\u2019t leave it in there!\u201dMarley flails and paces around in a circle. \u201cWhat if he\u2019s waiting for us to come back and get it?\u201d\u201cYou can stay here if you want, but I\u2019m going back for it. I\u2019m not leaving my purse behind because you hit some guy\u2019s car in a parking lot. I can\u2019t believe you just drove away!\u201d\u201cI thought I tapped it, and then I panicked.\u201d Her fingers are at her mouth now. \u201cI didn\u2019t want to drive up our insurance premiums over some guy and his Tesla.\u201d\u201cYou hit a Tesla?\u201d This keeps getting worse.\u201cAnyone who has the money to buy a Tesla has the money to fix it, right?\u201d Marley says.\u201cSo you drove off! Jeez, Marley. What were you thinking?\u201d I shake my head. I\u2019d like to say I\u2019m surprised by this, but sadly I\u2019m not. Marley doesn\u2019t always use common sense in day-to-day life.\u201cI don\u2019t know. I wasn\u2019t thinking. That\u2019s the problem, I guess.\u201dI\u2019m about to go back into the store, but stop short at the sight of the suit leaning against the side of my car, one ankle crossed over the other, all calm like. Dangling from a single finger is my knockoff, hot-pink Coach purse. \u201cForget something?\u201d"}, {"userName": "Jenny\u2022\u2022Steamy Reads Blog\u2022\u2022", "userReviewDate": "May 23, 2018", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/12634115-jenny-steamy-reads-blog", "userReview": "****Now Available****Definitely a fun read.

Pierce & Rian are both working in the Hampton's in real estate, and vying for the same properties while at the same time enjoying something new with one another.

From a memorable first meeting between two interesting and lovable characters to a series of not-so unfortunate events that lead them to each other's paths, I Flipping Love You promises a diverting rom-com packed with Ms. Hunting's signature humor and heart.Rian Sutter and Pierce Whitfield's first meeting is memorable, to say the least. There are groins getting hit by shopping carts, dinged Teslas, and mistaken identities involved. Thanks to Rian's flighty and slightly irresponsible twin sister Marley doing a hit-and-run on Pierce's fancy car, they have to pay him with money they can barely afford to spend. But unlike Marley, Rian knows what responsibility means, and she knows it's the right thing to do.You'd think that settling that issue would be the last of their interaction, but it's harder to shake off an interested and persistent Pierce than she first thought. Especially if Pierce is the brother of her and Marley's real estate client.After a blunder at his law firm, Pierce takes a few months' break in the Hamptons to regroup. He's no longer happy with what he's doing, and now he has a chance to do what he really wants\u2014flipping houses. When he meets Rian, he can't help but pursue her. She always thwarts his advances, staying as detached as she can, but he knows it won't take her long to admit that they have a connection stronger than lust. But with secrets threatening to come to light and dreams so close to coming true, a connection might not be enough to reach their happily ever after.Honestly, I wasn't so sure how I felt about Pierce consistently pursuing her at first, but he grew on me. He's cocky, confident, and endearing. He's also caring, sweet, and so transparent with his feelings. I love me some brooding men, but goodness do I love men who aren't afraid to express their feelings. That's Pierce, and I just love him for it. \nI cuddled the f*k out of you all night.\" I laugh. \"That you did.\"\"You know what that means, don't you?\" He wraps his arm around me and pulls me closer. \"It means we're dating.\"\nRian and Marley have gone through a lot, and it says so much about them\u2014Rian especially\u2014that they were able to go past it and find a way to survive with little to their names at such a young age. I'm not a huge fan of what Marley did at the beginning, so the jury is still out on that one. But I love Rian with all my heart. She's strong, resilient, sassy, and loyal. She deserves the best, and I cheered for her to reach her goal.Watching Pierce and Rian fall in love was an experience I'd love to relive again. They were funny, sweet, and incredibly heartwarming. The chemistry has been there from the start, but to see it grow alongside their feelings, to see them know more about each other and love what they find, it can make anyone swoon. I won't say how this book is related to the other books in the Shacking Up world, but the clues are all here. Besides, I think it would be more fun for you to find out yourself. If you're looking for an all-out romantic comedy with a touch of angst and a healthy dose of heart, you'll enjoy I Flipping Love You.Tropes: Hate to Love, Love in Real EstatePOV: First Person, Dual POVStandalone: Yes*ARC received in exchange for an honest review.

Confession #1 BLOGGER FAIL! I had no idea until I just pulled this up that it was book 3 in series! Apparently, I wasn't paying attention while reading the review request! On the plus side, it's a total standalone series so apparently, I didn't feel like I missed anything but am now anxious and a bit excited that I get to go back and read the others! I loved this book! Confession #2 This is only the second novel I've read by this author. *whispers... I wasn't much of a fan of the first*Please stop booing and throwing rotten vegetables at your computer ... it's unsanitary! Give a girl a break! Maybe I was in the wrong head space... \"we all read different books\" yadda yadda... and all other clich\u00e9 terms ... The point is when I was asked to review this book I figured... why not give her another shot and I'm so glad I did!! \ud83d\ude12... I'll wait for all the \"I told you so's\" to simmer down... (Y'all can yell at me in the comments) Look, I'm a picky reader. Usually trying to stay away from insta love and the toothache romance (I can't usually do too sweet because it usually comes off too farfetched...) However, there are a few authors that have mastered the beautiful sweet romance genre, and I have to admit... Hunting my just be one of those authors. I get it now, the reader love for Helena Hunting ... I get it. She created a beautiful sweet romance within the pages of I Flipping Love You, that swept me away with each turn of the page. I have to admit, I think her writing has progressed drastically since I read her last and I'm quite impressed with her writing style now. Ms. Hunting gives us a fun and quirky read full of swoon-worthy romance and shows us that you can have character turmoil without the overplayed repetitive back and forth about their \"issues\" and their \"haunted past\". I Flipping Love you is NOT a repetitive back and forth. It's a love story about a headstrong woman, a determined man, and a summer that will set the beach bodies on fire! I Flipping Love You is a free-flowing charming read that will redeem your outlook on men. Not all hotties these days (be it real or fake) need to always be the \"bad boy\". Pierce is the golden boy package. The one anyone would be glad to bring home to mom and dad. Sexy, sweet, successful and 100% Rian's from the moment they meet. \"Rian with an i\" comes face to face with Pierce in the strangest of circumstances but once they run into each other once, they can't seem to NOT run into each other. Each new encounter brings with it some smiles, some laughs, and some steamy pages. I simply adored Rian and Pierce. With their fun banter, instant chemistry, and beautiful passion, I have a feeling they just may be one of your new favorite couples. Readers should expect to devour this easy and quick read. May I suggest while on the beach? In fact, I highly suggest you grab this one for this year's summers vacation. You'll be glad you did! Though any time of year will have you smiling and escaping to the Hamptons with Rian and Pierce. May I also suggest perhaps not eating or drinking anything while reading chapter 15. Because honestly, no one likes to shoot mojito through their nose during a giggle fit.

Rian is a real estate agent/flipper living in the Hampton\u2019s with her sister, and trying to move on from a scandalous past that she didn\u2019t choose. Pierce is a patent lawyer in NYC who is taking a somewhat forced break in the Hampton\u2019s for the summer. Buying and fixing up rental properties along the beach and living with his younger brother. All it takes is a fender bender, a hit and run, and a case of mistaken identity to bring these two together.What these two have can only be described as constant kismet. Even though one party is reluctant to admit it there is chemistry, attraction, and tension between them. Combined with the fact they can\u2019t stop running into each other... how can they avoid the inevitable? I enjoyed Rian and Pierce\u2019s relationship. While all the characters in this book can be over the top at times, it works for me because this is a romcom. I also felt like the angst/drama in this book was reasonable and handled well by the characters. The banter was pretty funny. The naughty bits were sweet and steamy. It\u2019s just a fun, easy, and enjoyable read.https://instagram.com/p/Bi2EGpbB4O1/https://instagram.com/p/BjXMSfhAs4p/^ a fan edit on IG*ARC provided by NetGalley*"}, {"userName": "Lana \u2747\u273eDirty Girl Romance\u2747\u273e", "userReviewDate": "Jun 04, 2018", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/5498948-lana-dirty-girl-romance", "userReview": "4.5 STARS\n\nThat is what wanting someone is. This is the pinnacle of desperate attraction. This is the chemical reaction that ignites and burns until there\u2019s nothing left but ash.\n\n*dreamy sigh and googly eyes*This book was so flipping cute. I have an newly found obsession with all things Helena Hunting, but most especially her Shacking Up series. It's the perfect blend of rom-com, steam, and feels. It's just one of those easy, feel-good sort of romances that will leave you with a big ole' goofy and satisfied grins on your face when you're finished. And it had quite possibly one of the best meet-cutes I've read in quite a while. I mean, how funny when the gorgeous man staring at you in the grocery aisle is actually mistaken you for your fraternal twin sister that scratched his car and drove off? Well, Rian doesn't find it very funny, but I did. And the sparks were immediate between her and Pierce!\n\nWe\u2019re having a sleepover. We\u2019re going to do this all night, and I\u2019m going to cuddle you like a motherfucker after I finishing sexing every last orgasm out of you.\u201d \u201cOkay.\u201d I mean, what else can I really say to that?\n\nI loved Pierce's slow and thorough persistence in going after skittish Rian. Rian is done with gorgeous man and their defined bodies. She needs a 9/10 match, and that seems to set her up with boring but safe man that she has zero chemistry with. And of course it would figure that Pierce's mere presence makes her entire body tingle. But he's everything that shouldn't give into. She's focusing on getting her life back together, her real estate endeavors with her sister, and the gorgeous man that tempts her beyond reason doesn't fit in that picture. Unfortunately for her, he refuses to take no for an answer.\n\nDid you do that math in your head?\u201d \u201cYes.\u201d He crowds me. \u201cYou need to stop that.\u201d I have to tip my head up so I can meet his serious gaze. \u201cI need to stop doing mental math?\u201d \u201cIn public places, yes.\u201d I bite my cheek to keep my smile in check. \u201cDo I want to ask why?\u201d \u201cBecause I find it sexy, and it makes me want to do inappropriate things to you in this aisle.\n\nPierce was absolutely delicious. I loved his unrelenting pursuit of Rian almost as much as I loved to see her unsuccessfully fight the connection between them only to inevitably give in to the explosive fireworks. Pierce was the steady force to Rian's somewhat indecisive and skittish nature, and it was the perfect balance.Everything about this book worked for me; the chemistry, the pacing, the character development. It was funny and steamy and absolute romcom perfection. I enjoyed it thoroughly and cannot recommend it enough. I'm also hoping to get a bit of redemption for Lawson with the next book, because he drove me crazy with his mood swings in this one and I'm itching for the details of why.ARC courtesy of publisher in exchange for an honest reviewFind me on:"}, {"userName": "Corina\u261eBookTwinsReviews", "userReviewDate": "May 15, 2018", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/8905971-corina-booktwinsreviews", "userReview": "Woohoo - happy release day!!!Whenever I open up a Shacking Up\u00a0book by Helena Hunting I'm looking forward to her charismatic characters, her funny and heartwarming plots, and the sizzling and hot chemistry between the main characters.I FLIPPING LOVE YOU had all of the above.It was a sweet and easy romance, with a sexy side that kept me flipping pages. I loved the feel good feel of the story. Especially the main couple, Pierce and Rian (with an i) impressed me with their mature and grounded personalities. They were the heart and soul of the book and they carried the responsibility well.HH did a fabulous job of making me fall in love with Pierce and Rian. They were drama free, handled sticky events with grace and open mindedness. No rash actions from either one. I can say that I FLIPPING LOVE YOU was a delight from beginning to end. Its my favorite SHACKING UP novel so far, and all thanks to the main couple.Whenever Pierce and Rian where together the air sizzled and they had a hard time keeping their fingers of each other. But besides the sexy times, the couple really put effort into making their relationship work. I adored that most of all. Both equally thought before they acted, it was honestly refreshing and utterly satisfying. I would have loved to read a bit more about the flipping and remodeling aspect of the plot, but besides that it was a wonderful romance that I can only recommend.If you love HH's writing, and you love a good romance that makes you feel good \u00a0- you MUST give I FLIPPING LOVE YOU a try.

From the moment you read the first chapter, you immediately become hooked and cant wait to find out what\u2019s going to happen next. That is what I love about reading a new story. The thrill, the excitement, and those new found butterflies that seem to make an appearance on the cusp of something being new to you. Rian Sutter has had her fair share of family drama for the past few years and if there\u2019s one thing about her, is that she doesn\u2019t like drama or confrontation. Well little does she know, she\u2019s about to get a whole lot of that in the cereal isle. Yes you read that right. Who knew that going to the grocery store would be so life changing in the form of a hot suit?Pierce is tired of the Manhattan lawyer scene. Taking a much needed break in the Hamptons for the Summer to do what he loves, could be just the right thing that he needs. Renovating houses, and having a nice place to stay while enjoying his summer, what more can this man ask for? How about a woman who has managed to capture his attention and is deemed a once in a lifetime?As I\u2019ve said previously above, I absolutely loved the beginning of this story. It had an effortless humor, sexual tension that would\u2019ve made anyone crazy with lust, and a complicated but hilarious dynamic between the main characters. I simply adored those moments but for some reason, I just couldn\u2019t connect with the female heroine. I honestly don\u2019t know what it was but I wasn\u2019t on board with her as a person and that did diminish my reading experience. Aside from the fact that I thought we were going to get a lot more fixer upper and demo in the storyline, I liked the fact the author made some of the characters with real flaws and they were relatable. Everyone has secrets and we\u2019re all flawed in one way or another so I appreciated that she did that.If you\u2019re looking for a sweet humorous story, then this one is for you."}, {"userName": "L.J.

He recognizes the woman who not only hit his car and caused some damages, but also fled the scene. He confronts her and is met with opposition because she insists it wasn't her. Rian wants to be rid of this guy who insists she owes him for damages. Rian breaks free from Pierce and meets with her twin sister and discovers why this man is making these accusations. Her sister admits to the incident but believes Pierce is at fault, too. Rian manages to negotiate a settlement whose terms were hilarious. This ignites a turn of events where Pierce is now pursuing Rian because she is different and unforgettable. Rian resists because she has secrets that threaten her heart and while she is attracted to Pierce, she doesn't want him to learn what she is hiding.I enjoyed this book and loved the characters who each seemed to inject a kooky personality adding more depth to the storyline.

Their connection might be undeniable, but Rian as goals and baggage while Peirce is trying to make his own luck and isn\u2019t on the market for more than a fling or a flip. Yet they find themselves getting dirty not only fixing up their fixer uppers but with some bedroom gymnastics too. I loved pretty much everything about this story. It was fairly light hearted with just a touch of angst. The characters were mature and fun. I fell head over heels right away and love going on the journey of falling in love right along with them.

In fact, I have become obsessed with Helena Hunting. She has written a series that hit every mark for me. I read most of them while I was not in the privacy of my home... which meant Numerous Times, I was either laughing out loud or looking over my shoulder making sure no one could see the delicious, sexy, wonderful words that were consuming me.

These characters were the sweetest. I Flipping Love You is a charming romance from start to finish. Loaded with witty banter, sprinkled with sexual innuendos, and brimming with laugh-out-loud moments, it's a pure RomCom winner. I am such a fan of Helena Hunting and her quirky characters. They're easy to love, with distinct personalities that make them completely unforgettable. If you're looking for something light and sweet, something low on angst but high on swoon, then you've found your next read. It's a perfect romance that gave me all those delicious feels, and I more than enjoyed it.Rian, pronounced Ryan, and Marley, her twin sister, find themselves in a situation. You see, a week ago Marley accidentally \"grazed\" someones vehicle in the parking lot of the grocery story. Instead of stopping to see how much damage she did, she left the scene. This leads to one hell of a meet-cute a week later when Rian (Marley\u2019s twin) is accosted in the cereal isle of the grocery store by Pierce\u2014the victim of Marley's hit and run. Pierce and Rian are an absolute hoot. Their chemistry lights you on fire. The back and forth, the push and pull, the tension between them is everything. As these two work together to take care of Marley's mishap, it leads to major interest on Pierce\u2019s side for Rian, and man is it ever charming. I honestly, could not get enough of this cast of fun loving characters. Rian is somewhat closed off to the idea of relationships. She has baggage, but so does Pierce. They try to keep things chill but that chemistry they share, and Pierce\u2019s unrelenting desire to see behind Rian\u2019s walls, makes for one sexy romance,Overall, I Flipping Love You is delightful. A real estate agent, wannabe house flipper, falling for a rich lawyer from the city, looking to find something he's passionate about, and while doing that he finds Ryan, the girl of his dreams. GAH. GAH. GAH! Swoon and sweetness, I just loved it. I loved the writing, the pacing, the characters, the story, the everything. It was romantic, so full of heartfelt, tender goodness. A great read from start to finish.***Received an ARC off Netgalley in exchange for an honest review"}, {"userName": "Jacqueline's Reads", "userReviewDate": "Apr 01, 2018", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/4197769-jacqueline-s-reads", "userReview": "3.5 \u2013 4 StarsI Flipping Love you is a standalone and is part of the Shacking UP series. You can read each book on it\u2019s own, but it\u2019s best to read them in order. The Shacking Up series is adorable, fun and always gives you a good smile so if you are in the mood for a good time, this one is for you. The beginning of this book is very cute and I love the way Pierce and Rian meet-up. From the moment they meet it has been an up and down roller coaster. Rian is a tough cookie to crack. She\u2019s very set in her ways and she doesn\u2019t need to be in a relationship when she\u2019s trying to purchase and flip houses with her twin. I found her personality hard at times to get through only because the girl is so stubborn, but she\u2019s no pushover. Pierce is handsome, smart and who doesn\u2019t love a lawyer with big dreams. I love Peirce and to me he was the star of the show. I also love a Hero that chases after the Heroine. As Pierce continues to go after Rian, she tries to push him away but who can say no to him? The book overall is light, low angst and high in cuteness. The side characters are adorable like Pierce\u2019s brother and Rian\u2019s twin. I wonder if they will get their story?I flipping love you is a sweet treat.

I Flipping Love You is definitely my favorite of the series, and the perfect rom-com read for the summer. It\u2019s set in the Hamptons, with a sweet yet hilarious romance I thoroughly enjoyed reading. This book is HGTV meets romance, and Helena Hunting does an incredible job at incorporating the flipping houses aspect with the love story.I Flipping Love You has one of the best meet-cutes I\u2019ve ever read \u2013 mainly because it\u2019s not cute, but hilarious. A gorgeous man in a suit has been checking out Rian at the grocery store, but it turns out he\u2019s been keeping an eye out on her because he thinks she did a scratch-and-run with his car. Fortunately, it wasn\u2019t Rian who scratched his car. Unfortunately, it was her twin sister. What starts off as an already heated relationship sizzles even more as Rian and Pierce handle car troubles and coincidentally reunite in the Hamptons.Rian and Pierce have a fairly drama-free relationship, and I loved the slow burn aspect of it. Pierce knows what he and Rian have is a once-in-a-lifetime thing, but Rian is hesitant and reluctant. In between Pierce fighting for the woman he\u2019s falling for, we get lots of home renovation talk, hilarious one-liners, and the gorgeous setting of the Hamptons. This book honestly made me want to be relaxing by a pool, it has such a summer vibe. I highly recommend this one if you\u2019re in the mood for something light-hearted and fun this summer.\u201cI promise I\u2019ll take good care of your heart, Rian. And I promise it\u2019ll get easier if you keep saying it.\u201d He kisses me again, whispering against my lips. \u201cI love you.\u201dThanks to the publisher for generously providing me an ARC to review.Quotes are taken from the ARC and are subject to change in the final version.Amazon Ebook: https://amzn.to/2Ihtc3DAmazon Paperback: https://amzn.to/2JU8x2TAudible: https://amzn.to/2ro58BKLiked this review?

I flipping loved it \u2665.I Flipping Love You is the third book in the Shacking Up Series by Helena Hunting and one of my favorites so far.I Flipping Love You opened up with a comical situation that hooked me from page one. Rian & Pierce were a pair of characters that went to places in my heart, where I wasn't expecting them to go. I fell so hard for these two. This was a light and heartfelt romance, with Hunting's brand of humor and a fulfilling dose of steam that kept me flipping the pages. Overall a feel-good story that left me with a smile on my face.

This book FAR surpassed my expectations in the best of ways. I LOVED this book. I was DRUNK on it. I didn't want to put it down. In fact, if I could have I would've climbed right into the book and immersed myself in these characters lives! How in the HECK is this my first Helena Hunting novel? How come no one told me what a fantastic and HILARIOUS author she is!?! HMMM???? Joking aside, this is one my my absolute FAVORITE books of the year. I don't even care. It's got everything that I crave in a romance- a swoon worthy hero who is more interested in a relationship than the heroine, a sassy and FUN heroine who is as cute as a button and sweet as pie (also her sarcasm is top notch), a gorgeous setting that is described so well that you can practically taste the salt of the ocean and the sun on your skin, humor that is up to par with my favorite writers Meghan Quinn and Tara Sivec, AND a beautifully uplifting romance that will make you SWOON. Sheesh, this book has EVERYTHING. I HIGHLY recommend readers grabbing a copy of this novel the SECOND it hits the shelves because it is so damn good. I Flipping Love You tells the story of Rian (that's RYAN with an I- she is a GIRL) and Pierce. Both live in the Hamptons. One has a ton of money, the other is making a life for themselves after some unfortunate events within their family. When their worlds LITERALLY collide (a shopping cart, car mishap, and anything else that brings the crazy), they can't help but be drawn to one another (one more so in the beginning- it's so damn cute). Their relationship at first is merely based on coincidental meetings, but soon feelings begin to sore and what happens next... Well, you would have to read it to find out! This book brings flipping houses to the next level! Readers are going to LOVE the banter between Rian and Pierce and their slightly dysfunctional relationship. You are going to find yourself giggling the whole way through, and blushing from time to time. But the best part is the way they seep into your heart. Obviously, I HIGHLY recommend this book to romance fans and everyone else who needs a good laugh. So make sure to grab a copy when it comes out on May 29!
