People who look no different than you and me. But they lack a fundamental component of the human species: a conscience.\u201dAn Amish family of seven is annihilated at twilight in the tiny farming community of Painters Mill, Ohio. Kate Burkholder, Chief of Police, has her hands full trying to cover as much ground in the crucial first forty-eight hours of the homicide. Because of the cruelty and brutality inflicted on the victims, Burkholder immediately calls in for help. What follows is a dangerous venture into the dark, seedy underbelly of pornography, and the loss of innocence.After reviewing my highlights and notes, I realized that this book didn\u2019t quite measure up to the initial book in the series for two main reasons: repetition and repetition. See? It\u2019s annoying. I\u2019d have hoped that most mystery writers would take a cue from the Miss Marple, Hercule Poirot, and Nancy Drews series. It\u2019s not necessary to rehash the plot of the previous book until the reader is bored out of their mind. Carolyn Keene\u2019s books usually had a sentence that read something like: \u201cNancy, Bess and George had a close run-in with a ring of dangerous jewel thieves in an earlier adventure.\u201d Done and done!Apart from that, I just grew tired of Castillo\u2019s same use of descriptive words, especially the word \u201csage.\u201d Has anyone ever given you a \u201csage\u201d look? What does that even encompass? Or her reference to Kate\u2019s past and how it kept coming up in this investigation to haunt her. I get it.Don\u2019t get me wrong. This is a thrilling page turner. Could it have been better? Yes. Am I giving up on the series? Definitely not. I\u2019ve already purchased the third book, although I\u2019ll probably wait a minute or two before reading it."}, {"userName": "Liz", "userReviewDate": "Jul 07, 2017", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/4125660-liz", "userReview": "This book is not for the faint of heart. It starts with the gruesome murder of an Amish family of seven and goes from there. I really like Kate Burkholder, the formerly Amish police chief. This crime really hits home for her, reminding her of her youth. She's troubled to begin with and this crime doesn't do anything to bring her peace. Well written and fast paced. This was one of those books I kept trying to squeeze in just one more chapter.

I really enjoyed \"Sworn to Silence\" and looked forward to reading this one. I'm happy that I didn't spend any money on it since I could not finish it. The gory descriptions of the killings of the Plank family are not for the faint of heart and I had a hard time reading through the first 40 pages or so. My biggest problem, however, is that Ms. Castillo must think her readers are stupid. Why else, would we need to be reminded on every other page that Kate Burkholder grew up Amish and KNOWS what it's like and how it feels and how one can keep secrets. We get it, Ms. Castillo. So repetitive and unnecessary. Also unpalletable, are Ms. Burkholder's serious lapses in judgment since she is supposedly an experienced police officer. The book was overlong and in need of some serious editing. I seriously doubt that I will read the next in the series."}, {"userName": "Jim", "userReviewDate": "May 11, 2017", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/36199787-jim", "userReview": "\u201cThere are monsters living among us. People who look no different than you and me. But they lack a fundamental component of the human species: a conscience.\u201dThis is the second book in the Kate Burkholder series and it is a thriller. Officer Chuck \"Skid\" Skidmore is working the graveyard shift. After one too many cups of coffee at the diner where he was checking out the young waitress he pulled his cruiser over in a farmers field to answer natures call. That was when he heard the screaming. The screaming was coming from one of the farm workers. Investigating Skid finds the bodies of the owner of the farm and his sons. Kate is called in and upon further investigation it is discovered that the entire family, seven in all, have been brutally murdered. The Plank's had moved from Lancaster County Pennsylvania to Painters Mill, Ohio less than one year ago. They were respected and seemed the model of the Plain Life in the Amish community.Everything is not what it appears though. The Amish are a close-knit society and have their secrets. Kate finds a journal belonging to one of the daughters indicating that she had very dark secrets. Formerly Amish herself, Kate finds that she identifies with this daughter. For Kate this hits close to home, she is out raged, and she is determined to learn the truth about what happened that night.She calls State agent John Tomasetti who she met during the Slaughterhouse killings (Sworn to Silence). Kate and Tomasetti developed a complex relationship. Tomasetti has his own issues and is on administrative leave from the Ohio Bureau of Criminal Apprehension but that does not stop him from coming to Painters Mill ... and Kate. This case forces them both to face their troubled past.There is a lot of repetition and references to the first novel, Sworn to Silence, but I don't think it is to the point where it ruins the story. Linda Castillo does a wonderful job of bringing Kate Burkholder and her team to life. The setting is a terrific alternative to anyone seeking a change from the typical urban setting."}, {"userName": "Jonetta", "userReviewDate": "Sep 16, 2012", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/4876540-jonetta", "userReview": "Kate Burkholder and her detectives are severely challenged when an entire Amish family of seven is discovered brutally murdered on their farm. One was an infant and the two daughters were horrifically assaulted. They begin the investigation to determine who would have a motive and capability of committing such a heinous act and discover one of the daughters had been living a secret life.The crime was horrific and the details aren't spared so be prepared. However, all that occurs in the beginning and the rest of the story focuses on solving the crime and the mystery. There are distasteful revelations, though, that are heartbreaking. John Tomasetti makes another appearance as he and Kate continue to figure out just what kind of relationship they have and he has his own set of concerns to worry about. There's an exciting climax, though one could question Kate's judgment to some degree.I'm continuing to enjoy this series and its interesting cast of characters, especially Kate. The narrator again turns in a terrific performance, pacing the story perfectly, effectively adding tension and excitement and providing distinction to the character voices. For those for which narrative matters, the story is told in a combination of first person (Kate) and third person narratives (all other characters). In my opinion, it feels like the best of both worlds as you get the insights and emotions of the main character but don't lose the perspectives from others. I'm really looking forward to the next book"}, {"userName": "Sean Peters", "userReviewDate": "Mar 20, 2014", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/14058345-sean-peters", "userReview": "Another great read from Linda Castillo and the second Kate Burkholder books.One family. One horrific murder. An entire town under suspicion\u2026The Planks moved from Lancaster County Pennsylvania to the small Amish community of Painters Mill, hoping to resume the comforts of the Plain Life in Ohio. Less than one year later, the family of seven is found dead\u2014slaughtered on their own farm.This isn't just any brutal murder, either- a family of seven, Amish, bound and slaughtered. Sound pretty gruesome? It is. Kate Burkholder is the chief of police in the small town of Painters Mill. Formerly Amish, Burkholder finds the crime shocking and is immediately thrust into the center of a tornado of questions. Trying to find answers, Burkholder must confront her own past and penetrate the tightly-knit Amish community who distrust the 'English', as they call outsiders in a town uneasily divided along the lines of faith and culture.Castillo does a great job with her characterization. She really breathes life into her supporting cast, and you start to get to know Kate and all team better as well as Tomasetti.I really do like Linda Castillo's writing style, and the brutal crimes in \"Pray for Silence\" will make even the most avid genre reader flinch while reading. This is definately not a book for the squeamish as Castillo visits some pretty nasty corners of Painters Mill.While I don't think \"Pray for Silence\" was as nailbiting as \"Sworn...\" it's still a great read, and Cheif Burkholder is one of the best new characters to hit crime fiction in years. If you haven't discovered this series...do yourself a favour and pick up both Burkholder books. Just have another five to read, and as Linda Castillo says herself, her new book looks like being a best book, it's out in 2015."}, {"userName": "Lynne Davis", "userReviewDate": "Jul 27, 2017", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/22937637-lynne-davis", "userReview": "Excellent thriller by Linda Castillo, as police chief Kate Burkholder tries to solve the horrific murder of a family in Amish farm country.

Her and her friends need to have their mouths washed out with some soap. We get it already, you are not God-fearing, pacifist Amish. If the penchant for drinking away pain and the intimidation of witnesses didn't give us this impression, the frequent f-bombs certainly clue us in. Although I really do enjoy the wonderful writing and meticulous plots, I going to have to put the series aside. The excessive use of adult language has been a turn off.  Plot summary The normally quite town of Painter's Mill is left paralyzed by fear when in the early morning hours a family of 6 (or maybe 7)is found shot and murdered with no trace of a killer left behind. Amongst the family members killed by gunshot wounds, the two teenaged daughters appear to have been tortured while one of the girls was found to have been mutilated. It is the story of this savaged girl that leads the investigation. While investigation these brutal crimes, Kate Burkholder finds herself emotionally drawn into the investigation and she faces what she has lost and what could have been. The Good  Death and Destruction Brought to you by Thomas Kincade This series by Linda Castillo features one of the best setting for any crimes novels I have read. The peaceful and rolling countryside dominated by the insular Amish society provide a stark contrast for death and destruction. It is almost profane to imagine such dark crimes taking place in this pastoral setting. The author does a wonderful job of blending the beauty of the setting with the brutal and brooding darkness of the human mind. The Bad  Plug your Ears Grandma As I complained above, I felt the adult language was again excessive. As I chose to listen to the audio version of this book, the language really stood out. Linda Castillo continues to paint a story with stark contrasts. While the language may be used to contrast with the surroundings, I was put off by the constant swearing. Give the Woman a Tissue I always enjoy strong female characters. Without a doubt, Kate Burkholder is a strong woman...well, mostly. Unlike the first book, we found Kate, somewhat stereotypically, teary and close to losing control of her emotions. Granted, she does more than cry. Kate has a hard time with impulse control. Throughout the story she finds herself in bed with a person she is trying to avoid, drunk on several occasions when it was not appropriate, attacking a potential witness, finding herself unable to say no to the strong male character and in one major move, taking action that could conceivable cause her to lose her badge. While a broken character is believable, Kate felt like more a caricature that in the first novel. I expect the first novel of a crime series to involve a case that is personal to the protagonist. I thought we did that in the first novel. Apparently, it can get more personal. If I ever read the third novel, I hope it is less personal as that ground is now well tread. Final Thoughts The language aside, I really did enjoy the book. While I had issues with the development of Kate Burkholder, Linda Castillo is an amazing author with a wonderful sense of plot and setting. If you are not bother by adult language and you like dark crime novels, you will enjoy this series. Audiobook Notes If I do continue the series at a later point, it will not be in the audio format. I found myself tired of the narrator after this second book. She seemed to play up the frail emotions in her narration and added to the feeling of a stereotypical female lead. While her narration is fairly good, I don't enjoy her in this series.  Content Advisories  It is difficult to find commentary on the sex/violence/language content of book if you are interested. I make an effort to give you the information so you can make an informed decision before reading. *Disclaimer* I do not take note or count the occurrences of adult language as I read. I am simply giving approximations.Scale 1 - Lowest 5 - Highest Sex  -  4 There is sexual tension between characters and one non graphic description of an implied sexual encounter. There is some non graphic descriptions of a victims consensual sexual encounters. The rating was raised because there was a major theme of rape and sexual encounters where the victim could not give consent (through the use of drugs). Though the investigation, there is much discussion of forms of pornography where there is non consenting participants. While the description are at most, moderately graphic, it is a major theme and persistent. Language  -  4 While there may have been a small reduction in adult language from the first novel, I was still pervasive. I felt the use of mild obscenities and the f-word were excessive and unnecessary.  Violence  -  4 Violence is a major theme. It covers the gambit from execution style murder, suicide, torture and rape. The crimes are dark the perpetrators are unrepentant. While the violence is persistent, the author avoids gore and manages to be respectful despite the high violence level."}, {"userName": "Licha", "userReviewDate": "Jan 05, 2012", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/5614272-licha", "userReview": "This is the problem I have with series. The repetition of what happens in the first or previous book, the replay of each character's personality. It becomes annoying after a while. Why does all the information have to be repeated all over again? If someone wants to start with the second, third, etc book, then that's the risk that person runs of not having a full understanding of the storyline. However, for those of us who choose to start series from the beginning, I don't want to have to have it explained to me all over again in the second book what happened in the first. This made it very hard for me to focus on this story line and enjoy it all on its own. Instead, I found myself picking it apart. My mind began to drift and think that if I actually met the main character in real life, I probably wouldn't particularly like her too much. This in turn made me start feeling like the author was trying to make the reader admire what a strong woman Kate Burkholder was, how vehemently she felt for the victims, how human she was... It started becoming more of a chore to finish reading this book. The plot seemed too way-out for me to actually buy into. Snuff films/Amish girls. Come on. The love story between Kate and Tomasetti never really plays out and never really explains where it has gone between book one and two or where it's going to go. I don't know if that's to play it out into the next book, but it never really makes me believe what bond these two have besides the fact that both have gone through some horrific pasts.

Kate grew up in an Amish family but left the community as a teenager. Still, her past helps her deal with cases involving any members of the large Amish community in the area, as they have a tendency to mistrust the \"English\" police.In this, the second book in the series, Kate must investigate the shockingly brutal murder of an entire Amish family. Initial enquiries indicate that the Planks were upstanding members of the community and had no enemies. Why would anyone kill them, and with such vicious violence and cruelty that motives like robbery make no sense? But Kate soon discovers that, like everyone else, members of the Plank family had secrets. And with the help of John Tomasetti, her on-and-off lover, currently on leave from the Bureau of Criminal Investigation, Kate must get to the bottom of them.I think I'm done with this series. Kate Burkholder is a bad cop: bad in the sense of her investigations being illogical and downright dumb, and bad in the sense of her being utterly contemptuous of suspects' civil rights. I might read a book with such a main character if they're a sort of anti-hero protagonist, but as far as the narration is concerned, Kate is a great cop and all her actions are justified (and none of what are clearly lapses in judgment have any negative consequences). So, a family has been massacred, no indication of drugs whatsoever, and yet Kate's first instinct is to go harass the locals who she suspects (knows, as far as she's concerned) make meth. Why? Just because they are bad people and she judges they deserve to be harassed, even when there's nothing to indicate they've done anything wrong. Obvious lines of enquiry (e.g. which men were frequent visitors to the store where young Mary Plank worked?) must wait till much later.Then she decides she'll go harass someone because he once assaulted an Amish man, and there are indications that was a hate crime. The guy goads her (pretty mildly, to be honest), and she responds by assaulting him with her baton. And when the guy complains, both Tomasetti and her deputy, who were in the room, say they didn't see anything. Classic. It takes some doing to make me sympathise with scum like these guys, but Castillo manages it. In both those interactions, I was on the side of the suspects, not Kate's, and it really shouldn't have been that way. There were a couple of instances which were along the same lines in the previous book, too, so it's not a problem that's likely to get better.Additionally, both the first and second books in the series have young women tortured horribly and graphically, in ways that feel exploitative and titillating. If I'd felt more positively about Kate I might have given this series another shot and hoped this trend didn't continue. As it is, I'm done. Shame, because Castillo's previous books were just as dark but in a much more imaginative, original way, and with much better characters.MY GRADE: A D.AUDIOBOOK NOTES: The narrator is the same as in book 1, Kathleen McInerney. I liked her in that book, but she started to get on my nerves in this one. The voice she does for Tomasetti really isn't great (she does it raspy, but to me, in a way that crosses the line into creepy). Also, there was a particular scene where Kate is interrogating a young man with learning disabilities, and the way McInerney did her questions, exageratedly as if she was talking to a young child, disturbed me (well, Kate does describe him as \"mentally retarded\", which is a whole 'nother problem, and which McInerney might have taken as a clue as to what her attitude might be!)."}, {"userName": "Brenda", "userReviewDate": "Mar 28, 2013", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/2337007-brenda", "userReview": "Skid was totally over the graveyard shift!

Chatting to Mona back at the station to alleviate the boredom was another past-time; but when he heard screaming, like a wild animal in pain, he reported in to Mona, telling her he would take a look at the Plank farm, which was where the sound seemed to come from. The Plank family were Amish and had moved approximately a year before from Pennsylvania to the small and peaceful town of Painters Mill. But that night in October when Skid called into their farm, lives changed, for murder had visited the family.

What is unique is that her protagonist is a young, former Amish, female police chief in a small, rural Ohio town.In Pray for Silence, the second in the Burkholder series, an Amish family of seven is found brutally murdered on their farm, and Chief Burkholder and her small police force must investigate. Realizing she needs additional help, she calls upon her BCI pal, John Tomasetti, for assistance. There\u2019s a problem with that, however. Tomasetti is on administrative leave due to a previously failed drug test; nevertheless, he is anxious to pick up his relationship with Kate and comes running to assist with the case.I enjoyed the first book, Sworn to Silence, but I felt that Kate did not seem Amish enough for someone who spent at least 16 years being raised Amish. She frequently drinks to excess, she swears like a sailor, she bums an occasional Marlboro, and she seems to have rejected religion. In Pray for Silence, Kate\u2019s bad habits continue, making me wonder if Tomasetti is the only one who should be under the care of a psychiatrist to face his demons. In this book, Chief Burkholder does have more interactions with her Amish neighbors, of course, because the murders happened among them, and her knowledge of Pennsylvania Dutch is definitely an asset. We do get more insight to her feelings about her upbringing and events that happened to her as a teenager because she is strongly affected by what happened to one of the teenage female family members who was murdered.The descriptions of the murders and of the video evidence that is found are extremely graphic and disturbing, perhaps excessive for some readers. These crimes repulse Kate, and her response is visceral. She often struggles to maintain her composure and her professionalism; she reacts violently toward suspects then seeks solace afterward in a bottle of Absolut. While these reactions may not seem appropriate, they are understandable, and they make her seem very human. What doesn\u2019t fit for me in this novel is that she is too close to the case emotionally because of her past, and against her better judgment, she allows Tomasetti to become involved in the case. Of course, the whole plot doesn\u2019t work if these breaches in protocol don\u2019t occur, but Castillo allows Burkholder and Tomasetti to take some big chances personally and professionally in this book. Despite the flaws and errors, I really enjoyed this book. The police officers, as well as the Amish characters, seem like real life folks. The plot has just enough twists and suspects to keep things interesting almost to the end. I would prefer less sensationalism in the details \u2013 so much sex and violence can be overkill, if you\u2019ll forgive the pun. I do see development in Kate and John, and I look forward to seeing more growth in those characters as the series continues.4/5 stars"}, {"userName": "Anke", "userReviewDate": "Aug 13, 2015", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/2845457-anke", "userReview": "3.5 starsI read this is a rather short time, but in the end I was a bit disappointed. I was totally gripped until about 80%, but then I started skimming and the whole thing lost me. For one, the repeating of Kate's Amish upbringing and everything Amish got boring. Second, the whole development had several similarities to the previous book. Kate, although said to have lots of experience as a police officer, nevertheless, in both books she came up with several harebrained ideas. The murderer was a sociopath, again. Third, there was no development relationship-wise between Kate and John.On the other hand, the set-up got me interested enough to finish reading. I'm just not sure whether I'll give the next book a try."}, {"userName": "Kevin", "userReviewDate": "Jan 03, 2017", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/896357-kevin", "userReview": "Small town Ohio Amish innocence meets the darkest underbelly of humanity. Heavily violent, and stomach turning pornography and worse. The vilest of the vile of racist, prejudicial users of human beings. I found myself disgusted by the specificity of this book. The police procedural was interesting and I enjoyed the look into Amish culture. I liked the recurring characters enough I will likely revisit."}, {"userName": "Julie (A Girl and a Book)", "userReviewDate": "Jul 10, 2017", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/22435546-julie-a-girl-and-a-book", "userReview": "I am so in love with the series. It has just the right amount of grittiness that I love and I just can't read these books fast enough. Although the mystery in this one wasn't as good as the first in my opinion it was still fun. And I really enjoyed getting to know Kate even more through out this book, she is turning to such a great character.

As Chief of Police Kate Burkholder and her team work the scene, many things just don\u2019t add up.Chief of Police Kate Burkholder and her team work with scene with the help of the Ohio Bureau of Criminal Investigation.

She's the kind of single woman cop I like -- tough but sensitive, damaged by her past yet still open to new relationships, and the most important characteristic: she's not perfect and has some endearing flaws that make her human and someone you'd like to know.In this story, an Amish family of 7 is brutally murdered. The tragedy is magnified by the discovery that one of the children, Mary, was involved with an outsider. Could that association be what has led to her death? Chief Burkholder, aided by BCI agent John Tomasetti (also returning from the previous book) sets out to discover why someone would kill this family.The plot moves along rapidly and is interesting and absorbing. I was captivated and enjoying every page until we get to the very last segment of the book. Then Kate decides to use herself as bait to lure in the killer -- NOW COME ON -- this device has been used ad nauseum in so many thrillers that you'd think the authors would avoid it. All the loose ends are tied up and a conclusion neatly reached.(I had some issues with the fact that the two main characters were doing a lot of DUI and found it hard to believe they could function with the amounts of alcohol they consumed. And there was a lot of description about torture and sexual depravity that might not appeal to the more squeamish).All in all, I enjoyed this second novel in the series and will look forward to the third installment. I like the fact that the story has much interesting background about the Amish -- it adds a dimension to the story and to the various characters.Comment Comment | Permalink"}, {"userName": "Dianne", "userReviewDate": "Jul 08, 2011", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/1401819-dianne", "userReview": "Pray For Silence by Linda CastilloThis is the second installment of Linda Castillo's Amish detective/police procedural series; and while it may be enjoyable and even advisable for you to read her first novel \"Sworn to Silence\" to get a better idea of the background of our main characters, the town, and the religion, it is not absolutely necessary. Though I have a feeling that once you've read \"Pray For Silence\" you'll be hunting down the last book to see what you have missed!This book is set in the fictional Ohio town of Painters Mill, a small town with much of the townspeople being of the Amish faith. One night in mid-autumn, Officer Chuck \"Skid\" Skidmore is taking a break from patrol when he hears the eerie howl of what could be a cow mooing or a dog that has been hit by a car. Unfortunately, it was nothing so simple. It was the screaming of a man who had just found the bloody bodies of several members of a family. We come to find out that there are 7 dead family members including an infant and two tortured teenage girls, and that this crime looks like a murder-suicide.Right from the very first chapter, with no breathing room whatsoever, Linda grabs on to your throat and doesn`t let go. Actually, you won`t want her to let go since this book is so spellbinding, provocative and complex. There are some very clever red herrings and a tiny bit of clever misdirection with some of the suspects. Frankly, I thought I had it figured out but was pleasantly surprised to be surprised at the ending.To complicate things further there are relationship problems between Kate and John Tomasetti a BCI agent who has helped Kate in the past and will do so again in this book. And further problems arise when the other Amish are a little reluctant to get involved with the \"Englishers\". Linda has a deft way of blending the Amish religion and lifestyle into these novels that deal with things the Amish rarely have to contend with.A superb read and I will be waiting anxiously for the next book in this series."}, {"userName": "Rachel (TheShadesofOrange)", "userReviewDate": "Oct 17, 2016", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/7487619-rachel-theshadesoforange", "userReview": "4.0 StarsI'm really enjoying this gritty mystery series.The second book in this series is just as strong as the first. Castillo has a knack for writing engaging stories with strong characters. Her writing is decent, although she has a tendency to reuse phrases too often. There is some very dark and disturbing content in her books, with detailed descriptions of both physical and sexual violence. Despite the difficult subject matter, I was, once again, hooked into the mystery. Highly recommend to any fans of mystery novels."}, {"userName": "Stacy Green", "userReviewDate": "Dec 18, 2013", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/5500554-stacy-green", "userReview": "I'm giving this book 3.5 stars because I read it in two days, and the murder plot kept me entertained. I didn't feel like it kept me quite as emotionally invested as the first. And I did notice parallels to the plotting in the first, which is fine, but I think that's why this book didn't seem quite as original as the first. However, the plot was solid and very dark, so be warned.
