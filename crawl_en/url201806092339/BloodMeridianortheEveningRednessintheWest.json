The man sat down again like a man sitting down.I didn't really like the book, said the dead deer.I reckon I was pretty conflicted, replied the man grimly.His writing style is pretty problematic.I reckon his style is perty silly, he just strings a bunch of them declarative statements together, like 'the man did this then the man did that etc\", but they don't paint no picture, they're done totally unevocative of anything. I reckon it don't take no skill to just state in excessive detail what someone is doing. It takes artistic skill to say it in a way that done bring it to life for the reader, and he don't done really do that. I reckon it's some sub-Hemingway shit he's doing.It's not all bad though.I reckon some some of the images t'were pretty powerful.And the judge is a memorable character.I reckon he's the only one though. All the rest of them there charac'ers ain't real memorable, like he done put no effort into 'em 'cause he spent all his time on the judge. And that there whole novel was all...whatdjacallit, structureless and stuff. And real repetitiv' too.I read that he doesn't see why people like Proust and James because he thinks all novels should be about life and death things.I reckon that's 'cause he's too obsessed with subject matter and not enough with style and art.The dead deer nodded and walked out. The man slowly got up again by putting one foot then the other on the floor and then used his hands to push himself up out of the chair.

It\u2019s also one of the best.For those who would consider that a turn-off, I offer this caveat:For the overwhelming majority of fiction that involves a lot of violence, the violence itself is an act of masturbation representing either the author\u2019s dark impulse or, perhaps worse, pandering to the reader\u2019s similar revenge fantasies (this might explain why the majority of Blood Meridian fans I know personally are men, where as the majority of those who\u2019ve told me they were unable to finish it are women).Don\u2019t get me wrong, the violence in Blood Meridian is gratuitous. It\u2019s both mentally and emotionally exhausting, even in a day and age where television and movies have numbed us to such things. But unlike, say, the movie 300, the violence serves a purpose \u2013 in fact the gratuitousness itself serves a purpose. Like how the long, drawn out bulk of Moby Dick exists to make the reader feel the numbingly eventless life of a whaling vessel before it reaches its climactic destination (McCarthy is frequently compared to Melville, btw), Blood Meridian exists to break the reader\u2019s spirit. Like the mercenaries the narrative follows, the nonstop onslaught of cruelty after cruelty makes us jaded. The story brings us to what we think is a peak of inhumanity that seems impossible to exceed, and just as we stop to lick our wounds, an even more perverse cruelty emerges. The bile that reaches the tip of our tongue at reading of a tree strewn with dead infants hung by their jaws at the beginning of the book (a scene often sited to me as the point many readers stop) becomes almost a casual passiveness when a character is beheaded later on. We become one of these dead-eyed cowboys riding into town covered head-to-toe in dried blood and gristle. The story is based on My Confession, the questionably authentic autobiography of Civil War Commander Samuel Chamberlain, which recounts his youth with the notorious Glanton Gang \u2013 a group of American mercenaries hired by the Mexican government to slaughter Native Americans. Whether or not Chamberlain\u2019s tale is true only adds to the mythic quality \u2013 exemplified by the character of Judge Holden.Blood Meridian is really The Judge\u2019s story. He is larger than life. Over seven feet tall, corpulent, hairless, albino, described as having an infant-like face and preternaturally intelligent. He is a murderer, child killer, pedophile and genocidal sociopath. But the question that plagues anyone who reads the book is \u2013 who is he really?The easiest conclusion is that he is the devil, or some other demon. His joyous evil and fiddle-playing are enough clues to come to that, but more controversial (and less popular) is the idea that he is actually the wrathful God of an uncaring universe. He\u2019s called THE Judge, after all.He spends a great deal of time illustrating new discoveries \u2013 be it an Indian vase or petroglyph \u2013 only to destroy it when finished. It\u2019s commented that he seems intent on \u201ccataloging all creation\u201d. When a fellow mercenary asks why he does it, he smiles and cryptically replies \u201cThat which exists without my knowledge exists without my consent.\u201dThe fact that the book is rife with biblical imagery implies that he is more than a mere symbol of man\u2019s inhumanity to man (which is not to say that the devil isn\u2019t), but when the book ends (\nSPOILER ALERT\n) and our protagonist\u2019s body is found shoved into a commode, the townsfolk stand staring into the darkened doorway of the latrine, eerily mirroring the apostles staring into empty crypt after the resurrection. But here, there is no ascension; no salvation offered. Only the Judge, who dances to the closing lines, \u201cHe is dancing, dancing. He says that he will never die.\""}, {"userName": "Stephen", "userReviewDate": "Feb 05, 2011", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/1413439-stephen", "userReview": "Spilled...emptied...wrung out\u2026soul-ripped...that pretty accurately sums up my emotional composition after finishing this singular work of art. Ironically, I\u2019m sure I only absorbed about 10% of the \u201cmessage\u201d McCarthy was conveying in this epic exposition on war, violence and man\u2019s affinity for both. Still, even with my imperfect comprehension, I was shaken enough by the experience that, though I finished the book days ago, I\u2019m just now at the point where I can revisit the jumble in my head enough to sort through how I feel. One feeling I have is that Cormac McCarthy is word-smithing sorcerer and a genius of devious subversion. He's taken the most romanticized genre in American literature, the Western, and savagely torn off its leathery, sun-weathered skin in aid of showing an unflinching, unparalleled depiction of man at his most brutal and most violent. This is man as \u201cworld-devourer.\u201d Oddly enough, in subverting the Western motif, McCarthy may have written its ultimate example. I tend to agree with Harold Bloom\u2019s assessment when he says, \u201cIt culminates all the aesthetic potential that Western fiction can have. I don\u2019t think that anyone can hope to improve on it\u2026 it essentially closes out the tradition.\u201d Well said, Mr. Bloom. PLOT SUMMARY/CHARACTERS:Based, at least partially, on real life events, the story is set around 1850, immediately after the end of the Mexican-American War, and takes place in the \u201cborderlands\u201d between the two countries that stretches from Texas to California. The narrative follows a young teenager, known only as \u201cthe kid,\u201d who runs away from his father in Tennessee after his mother dies. \nSee the child\u2026 He can neither read nor write and in him broods already a taste for mindless violence. All history present in that visage, the child the father of the man.\n After engaging in a number of notably violent occupations (including bison hunter/skinner and as a soldier in an \u201cirregular\u201d army borderland goon squad), the kid eventually hooks up with a group of scalphunters led by John Glanton (historically known as the Glanton Gang). The rest of the story follows the kid and his exploits with the Glanton Gang as they cut a swatch of violence across the borderlands that is unlike anything you are likely to have read about before. However, the narrative of the kid and the Glanton Gang are simply there to give McCarthy\u2019s story a framework to work through, a context. This is not a novel about the history of the borderlands or the atrocities that were committed there. That is incidental to its purpose. McCarthy uses the lawlessness and extreme carnage of the period and the horrific events that transpire as a microcosm to explore the nature of war, violence and man\u2019s unrivaled capacity for unmitigated depravity. Not a beautiful subject\u2026but soooooooo beautifully done. This brings me to Judge Holden (aka \u201cthe Judge\u201d), one of the most memorable literary figures I have ever come across. He's also among the most amoral, depraved, sadistic, and remorselessly cruel individuals I have encountered in my reading. In the character of the Judge, McCarthy has distilled and personified the ultimate expression of war and violence. He is a manifestation of pure evil, a spokesman for the belief that war is man\u2019s calling and his purest state is to be an instrument for violence. Fun guy huh?The Judge's philosophy is that \"War is god,\" man\u2019s purpose is to be its ultimate practitioner and any attempts to civilize or reform this aspect of man are doomed to failure.  \u201cMoral law is an invention of mankind for the disenfranchisement of the powerful in favor of the weak. Historical law subverts it at every turn.\u201d He preaches that only by embracing and celebrating man\u2019s capacity for violence can man attain his true potential. \n If God meant to interfere in the degeneracy of mankind would he not have done so by now? Wolves cull themselves, man. What other creature could? And is the race of man not more predacious yet? \u2026 This you see here, these ruins wondered at by tribes of savages, do you not think that this will be again? Aye. And again. With other people, with other sons.\nThe Judge is described as huge, completely hairless and very pale. He speaks multiple languages, is well-versed in classic literature and has extensive knowledge of many of the natural sciences. Throughout the story, the Judge is shown as almost \u201cotherworldly.\u201d He is depicted accomplishing seemingly miraculous deeds and having \u201cspecial\u201d insight into events. He appears not to age despite being seen over a span of 30+ years. In addition, everyone who rides with him recalls \u201cseeing the Judge\u201d earlier in their life (and always at a time of great violence). I came to see him as the \u201cMuse of War and Violence.\u201d Here is a great description from the end of the book where the kid muses on where the Judge came from:\n A great shambling mutant, silent and serene. Whatever his antecedents, he was something wholly other than their sum, nor was there system by which to divide him back into his origins for he would not go. Whoever would seek out his history through what unraveling of loins and ledgerbooks must stand at last darkened and dumb at the shore of a void without terminus or origin and whatever science he might bring to bear upon the dusty primal matter blowing down out of the millennia will discover no trace of ultimate atavistic egg by which to reckon his commencing. \n Whatever the Judge\u2019s true nature, he is singularly compelling.THE WRITING:One quality of McCarthy\u2019s writing that amazes me is that it is both fire and ice for the soul. His unique style combines both (i) sparse, but deeply layered prose similar to Hemingway (i.e., short, seemingly straight-forward sentences that upon further inspection can mulch up your insides) with (ii) flowery \u201cimage heavy\u201d descriptions that are almost Shakespearean in their melodrama. The combination can be devastating and it's why I am so sure I only absorbed a fraction of what McCarthy was saying on the first read. Almost every sentence, if you go back and re-read it can be chewed more slowly to increase the amount the amount meaning and flavor released. This is the kind of book I think you should read once and then subsequently re-read a chapter at a time over a much longer period. At least that was my impression. Much of Blood Meridian is written from a dream-like yet \u201chyper alert\u201d state of consciousness. No, not dream-like, more like nightmarish as McCarthy constantly transforms the settings into aspects that call to mind classical visions of hell. Here are a just a few quick examples I picked out: \n They rode through a region where iron will not rust nor tin varnish. The ribbed frames of dead cattle under their patches of dried hide lay like the ruins of primitive boats upturned upon that shoreless void and they passed lurid and austere the black and desiccated shapes of horses and mules that travelers had stood afoot. These parched beasts had died with their necks stretched in agony in the sand and now upright and blind and lurching askew with scraps of blackened leather from the fretwork of their ribs they leaned with their long mouths howling after the endless tandem suns that passed above them. The riders rode on. \n I love that last sentence, \u201cThe riders road on.\u201d It\u2019s just so Hemingway. Here\u2019s another: \nOn the day following they crossed the malpais afoot, leading the horses upon a lakebed of lava all cracked and reddish black like a pan of dried blood, threading those badlands of dark amber glass like the remnants of some dim legion scrabbling up out of a land accursed, shouldering the little cart over the rifts and ledges, the idiot clinging to the bars and calling hoarsely after the sun like some queer unruly god abducted from a race of degenerates.\nCONCLUSION: In sum, a truly sublime experience. After reading No Country for Old Men, I was not sure that McCarthy would ever be able to floor me like he did in that book. I was mistaken. Round two with McCarthy has found me once again knocked to the canvas with my brain reeling. I'd be hard-pressed to choose a winner between the two, but this one definitely has become the newest addition to my list of all time favorites. 6.0 stars. HIGHEST POSSIBLE RECOMMENDATION!!!"}, {"userName": "Michael Finocchiaro", "userReviewDate": "Jul 16, 2016", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/48483884-michael-finocchiaro", "userReview": "Breathless. Unique. Brutal. There are many words that could be used to describe Blood Meridian by Cormac McCarthy. For me, this was my second time through and I liked it far better than my first reading. Judge Holden, John Job Glanton, Toadvine, and the \"kid\" are all fantastic characters. I shudder to think that the horrors visited upon the Indians and Mexicans and homesteaders were all based on fact. The apocalypse described in The Road is not too far a cry from the hellish country on the US-Mexico border (which has not really changed if we exchange the scalper mercenaries for the drug cartels) and yet the descriptions and language of Blood Meridian is more beautiful to me. The symbolism here is quite strong and one wonders whether the author is a nihilist like his characters or if there is really some redeeming quality buried deep inside man...a true American masterpiece.I would read The Border Trilogy after finishing Blood Meridien. I have not tried Suttree or Child of God, but they would have a hard time to top this one!"}, {"userName": "Lyn", "userReviewDate": "Jul 18, 2011", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/5253785-lyn", "userReview": "After reading Blood Meridian, I may never view a western film the same way again. To be certain, it is a masterpiece, a rare and unique work of literature that rises above classification and genre. And to be certain, McCarthy must be viewed as a great American writer, one of the greatest in our time. That having been said, this book is not for everyone; it is painfully brutal, violent at it's heart. McCarthy's primitive writing style emphasizes this primal, bloody landscape like a Jonathon Edwards sermon. Glanton and Judge Holden, based upon actual persons, have been written as archetypal villains. The Judge may be a composite of Mephistopheles and Conrad's Mr. Kurtz, and perhaps even Richard III. Strong, powerful book."}, {"userName": "\u00b7Karen\u00b7", "userReviewDate": "Aug 11, 2011", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/1652898-karen", "userReview": "This is Jane Austen antimatter. Trying to convey how this was so different to anything I've ever read, it occurred to me that it was like a huge black vortex that would suck early nineteenth century marriage plot novels into the void. It's the complete obverse of sweet girlie stuff: no lurve, no irony (I wonder if Cormac McCarthy has a humour mode? If he does, he certainly wasn't in it writing this), no insightful self-discovery or examination of the human heart. No, this is bleak and bloody, gory and grisly, there are bludgeonings and beheadings, shootings and stabbings and skewerings and scalpings, and piles and piles and piles of corpses - as a film, I wouldn't have been able to stand it. How could I stand it here? Well, it was usually over pretty quickly. He doesn't dwell long and lovingly on every detail: radical and dramatic images burn on the mind's eye, but no prurient poking and puddling. Nasty, brutish and short. Stomach churning, but not for too long.Then there is little in the way of plot. Characters? Bad, worse, or imbecile. So what pleasures does it afford, pleasures that can compensate for the horror? Or is it the horror that becomes pleasurable? Yes, that is the worrying thing - obviously the language is a wonder and can make up for much, but there is a very troubling phenomenon. The reader begins to take on the reasoning of the charismatic, satanic Judge Holden: this is a game in which the stake is life itself. There is only life or death, nothing else. And the Glanton gang is so evil that we can take joy in their annihilation, and the kid is the only one who has shown the slightest faint scruple when it came to slaughtering, so we hope for his survival and follow keenly his fight for life. And did I mention the language? Majestic, portentous, weighty, reminiscent of Milton and Blake and the Bible. Sparse, terse dialogue. Sumptuous description. A fearless novel that shocks and troubles, especially when you realise that this is based on real events on the Texas borderlands in 1848-51. \"... and not again in all the world's turning will there be terrains so wild and barbarous to try whether the stuff of creation may be shaped to man's will or whether his own heart is not another kind of clay.\""}, {"userName": "Eric", "userReviewDate": "Sep 07, 2007", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/351034-eric", "userReview": "There are two ways to evaluate a book, as far as my unlearned mind can concoct at the moment. Stylish literary flourishes sometimes cloud our judgment when it comes to evaluating the plot itself, which is, after all, the reason why the book exists.This book is well written. If I'm a 11th grader, and I need to do a book report, I'm drooling over the blatant symbolism dripping from each page. The scene is set admirably, though the repetitive nature of our brave hero's wanderings (at least it's with symbolic reason) lead to a paucity in novel adjectives by the 13th desert crossing. There are only so many ways one can say that it's hot, dry and empty. And dry. Boy, that sun sure is strong. I'm there, I'm with you, all right, it sucks around here, phew, the sun's really beating down today. And there are a lot of bones. Dead things abound, OK, I get it.Then there's the story line. Explain to me again why I'm interested in the wanton marauding of a band of depraved demons? So, we enjoy the dashing of infants into rocks because of the supposed literary merits of the work? We can bash/splatter/expose brains of whatever, happen upon crucified corpses, and ignore any modicum of human decency because the book is about something deeper? But, you say (and without quotes you say it), that's what it was like. Oh yeah? It was like that? Says who? Why do you want to believe that it was like that? As bad as humankind is, our reality is not that despicable, though our souls may be. Why do we have to play follow the leader behind our impish pied piper, pretending an enlightened understanding of some grandiose truth, while all we really do is sate our own personal blood lusts? I wonder.By the way, if neglecting quotation marks somehow makes the book classier, why not just go all out and remove spaces between words. You better believe I won't be speed reading the repetitive descriptions of how tired everyone is if there aren't any spaces. Why stop there, periods are for two bit hacks too. You're not a real author until you slaughter a few hundred non-innocents (nay, no one is innocent) while neglecting a basic courtesy to the reader.

"Cormac McCarthy's west of absolutes is a wonder to behold. Villainous attacks on people devoid a home, desecration of the west-land, listings of all things in the majestic, transitory landscape like observations by Darwin at the Galapagos in lush (sometimes horrific) detail, murky human psyches, no dialogue, and especially that campfire philosophy by which anyone can find some sort of meaning in their modern lives (especially if you're fortunate enough to inhabit the places which Mr. McCarthy describes!)... are all the ingredients of a McCarthy book and the way this one is polished, symbolic & graphic makes it my favorite McCarthy book by far.The apocalyptic landscape of \"The Road\" is here, but it's thankfully not as literal as that novel about human annihilation after cataclysm. If you were shocked by the cannibals eating babies in that one... well, you ain't seen nothin'. This ultraviolent account is well researched, well versed, poetic. The \"Blood Meridian\" and the act of scalping are one: you simply lose most of your head as you look at the very promise the west has (had) to offer. My favorite line: \"A lamb lost in the mountains cries. Sometimes comes the mother. Sometimes comes the wolf...\"Lawlessness and betrayal reigns supreme. Apache attacks and famine are omnipresent; & it is this blood-thirst that shocks the reader and at once impels him to continue reading to see what befalls the group of barbarians & sinners next."}, {"userName": "Samadrita", "userReviewDate": "Mar 26, 2015", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/13266158-samadrita", "userReview": "The wiki page for 'manifest destiny' has a picture of a painting by John Gast depicting an angelic figure (personification of America) purposefully drifting towards the west, her pristine white robes and blonde curls billowing in the breeze, a book nestled in the crook of her arm. Airborne, she awakens stretches of barren, craggy terrain to the magical touch of modernization. The landscapes she leaves behind are dotted by shipyards and railways and telegraph wires strung on poles but to her left the canvas shows a murky abyss - skies darkened by smoke from volcanic eruptions and fleeing native Americans gazing up at the floating angel in alarm.Whenever I think of 'Blood Meridian' from now on, I hope my mind conjures up this same image not because both painting and novel provide perspectives, albeit contrary, on America's ambitious mid 19th century pursuit of extending its frontiers. But because Cormac McCarthy destroys this neat little piece of Imperialist propaganda so completely and irredeemably in his masterpiece, that all viewings of the image henceforth will merely serve to magnify the irony of this representation. If John Gast's visualized panorama seeks to establish the legitimacy of the American Dream, vindicates the Godgiven right of determining the foundations of civilization, then McCarthy's vision of 'American Progress' brutally mocks the same and depicts the wild west as a lawless hunting ground submerged in a moral vaccuum. Here, there is no line of distinction between predator and prey. Heads are scalped, entrails ripped out, limbs dismembered, ears chopped off as trophies of war. Apaches, Mexicans, Caucasian men, women and children are skewered, bludgeoned, crucified and raped alike and so routinely and relentlessly that after a while the identities of victim and perpetrator blur into each other and only a dim awareness of any moral consideration remains at the periphery of our consciousness. The barrel of the gun and the sharpness of the blade speak in the universal language of might over right and all humanly attributes are silenced into submission.\nThe wrath of God lies sleeping. It was hid a million years before men were and only men have power to wake it. Hell aint half full. Hear me. Ye carry war of a madman's making onto a foreign land. Ye'll wake more than the dogs.\nThere are no protagonists here. Only creatures of instinct shambling along sun-scorched sand dunes, mesas and buttes, pueblos and haciendas, gravel reefs and dusty chaparrals, oblivious of the passage of time or the context of their grotesque exploits, unhesitatingly leaving a trail of mutilated corpses, carcasses and torched Indian villages in their wake. Jaded as one becomes from all the savagery, one does occasionally feel some measure of empathy for 'the kid' but then he vanishes often among the featureless, faceless individuals of Glanton's gang of scalp-hunters as they embark on a destination-less journey across the cruel, hostile terrain of the US-Mexican borderlands. In course of their blood-soaked, gory quest which McCarthy chronicles in exquisite turns of phrase, the identities of all the members of the band fuse together to symbolize something much more profound and terrible to comprehend all at once - the primeval human affinity for bloodshed which devours all distinctness of personality. Only the ageless Judge Holden towers over the other characters as the Devil's advocate with his lofty oratory on the primacy of war and his unabashed exhibitionism and seeming invincibility. \n...war is the truest form of divination. It is the testing of one's will and the will of another within that larger will which because it binds them is therefore forced to select. War is the ultimate game because war is at last a forcing of the unity of existence. War is god.\nIn the last few pages when the Kid and the Judge parley in a sort of face off, I finally came to realize the real reason why the former is deprived of his centrality in the plot and relegated to the status of a mute presence in the background. As the eternal representative of the debilitating voice of morality which is always drowned out by fiercer cries for carnage, the Kid's internal sense of right and wrong, too, fails to resist the evil within. The Devil's cogent arguments, no matter how preposterous at times, negate all sporadic pricks of conscience. \nIf God meant to interfere in the degeneracy of mankind would he not have done so by now? Wolves cull themselves, man. What other creature could? And is the race of man not more predacious yet? The way of the world is to bloom and to flower and die but in the affairs of men there is no waning and the noon of his expression signals the onset of the night.\nNeedless to say, this is the grim rationale that underpins all the interminable slaughter. And such a solemn message leaves one with a lingering suspicion that if we peeled away the glossy veneer of democracy, modernity and the daily grind of mechanistic endeavours and reduced any society of humans to its bare bones, McCarthy's apocalyptic vision of an amoral world is the only thing that might remain - a perpetual heart of darkness. A conjecture as staggering in its enormity as it is bone-chilling. Perhaps, a conjecture with a modicum of truth to it."}, {"userName": "Dan Schwent", "userReviewDate": "Mar 27, 2012", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/870755-dan-schwent", "userReview": "In the old west, a young man falls in with a bad crowd, scalphunters, and the worst of them all, the judge.It's not often when I can't figure out how to summarize a book. Not only does Blood Meridian fall into this category, I'm also struggling with trying to formulate my thoughts about it. I'm sure it's one of those big important books that has themes and things of that nature. It seems apocalyptic at times, with the judge showing the kid the horrors of the world, kind of like the devil and Jesus in the desert.Cormac McCarthy's prose is simple but powerful. It also feels really smooth, like he barely had to work at it at all to get it on the page. It has an almost Biblical feel to it. Once the kid hooks up with the judge and the Glantons, things get worse and worse, like getting kicked in the crotch by progressively more spiky shoes.There were a lot of times during my read of Blood Meridian where I had to stop and digest what I just read. It had a dreamlike, or nightmarish, quality a lot of the time. The judge is by far the most memorable character in the piece.The book really doesn't have much of a plot, just scene after scene of brutal violence. I read a lot of detective stuff but this was one of the most violent books I've ever read. I could only read it for 30-45 minutes at a time before I had to stop and digest.Lastly, what's with the lack of quotation marks?

McCarthy pulls back the curtain to reveal the unforgivable evils and trespasses our species made all too often and all too easily in a new world, a novel that shows us the true price we paid in bodies and blood for the expansion of the 'Wild West'. Unlike some of Cormac's other work, 'Blood Meridian' is not a particularly easy read for either style or subject matter. If your want to experience the work of this true literary master, I certainly wouldn't start with this book (Try 'The Road', or 'No Country For Old Men' to get your feet wet). Generally, I only advocate that people read well-written work that is fluid, pacey, and has total command of the language. But there are a handful of exceptions where I honestly believe that a good deal of effort is also required from the reader. 'Blood Meridian' is one such book, written on its own terms by an author who plays by his own rules. You will have to work to get through the pages, but it is rewarding in ways you might not anticipate. The brutality in this book is harrowing, and also true of the time. There have been countless analyses of it, so I won't get into the many themes, messages, and interpretations it offers. I will say that it does fall under the category of 'required reading' for everyone. However, it must be said that this book was not written for anyone's enjoyment. It wasn't written for entertainment. It was written to open your eyes to a hell on earth that humans willingly created, to open your ears to the beating of black hearts. If this book doesn't shake your faith in the human race, then nothing will.*This book was one of my '10 Books That Stuck With Me' piece.

This book is monumental. Seems like a contradiction, brutal and poetic, but somehow it works.

Tough book, not sure I took it all in and had to take some breaks during the read.... but hey, it's Cormac McCarthy...a grand writer he is. It was evening of the following day when they entered San Diego.

Loose strands of ambercolored kelp lay in a rubbery wrack at the tideline. A dead seal. Beyond the inner bay part of a reef in a thin line like something foundered there on which the sea was teething. He squatted in the sand and watched the sun on the hammered face of the water.

Based on historical events that took place on the Texas-Mexico border in the 1850s, we follow and witness the grim and bloody coming of age of the Kid, a fourteen-year-old Tennessean who stumbles into a nightmarish world where Indians are murdered and the market for scalps is thriving...They rode on and the sun in the east flushed pale streaks of light and then a deeper run of color like blood seeping up in sudden reaches flaring planewise and where the earth drained up into the sky at the edge of creation the top of the sun rose out of nothing like the head of a great read phallus until it cleared the unseen rim and sat squat and pulsing and malevolent behind them. The shadows of the smallest stones lay like pencil lines across the sand and the shapes of the men and their mounts advanced elongate before them like strands of the night from which they'd ridden, like tentacles to bind them to the darkness yet to come.

Butchering? Yes, you're probably right. Butchering them. That's the right word. Anyway, since Cormac McCarthy has the most distinctive and powerful voice of any modern writer (that I've read recently)(in my opinion), I pose the question: what if Cormac McCarthy were to revisit the classics of the English canon? What if McCarthy had been the author of The Great Gatsby? How would it have ended up? I think this is an important enough question to begin a new writing project, or, at the least, write a Goodreads review pretending I'm going to. First, we have to establish these new versions of the classics will be stylized after McCarthy's Western Novels, starting with Blood Meridian and ending with Cities of the Plain. Characteristics include:1) No punctuation other than periods and question marks.2) No indication of who is talking during dialogue, although you can always tell. 3) Poetic descriptions of barren landscapes which often reflect the callous indifference of nature to the plights of humanity. 4) Untranslated Spanish dialogue.5) No hint of the characters' internal dialogue; all characters are revealed only through action and conversation.6) Gratuitous and unexpected acts of horrendous violence.7) During casual conversation, characters frequently say incredibly profound shit. Although there's more to his style than this, we can take this as the most bare-essential aspects of what is necessary to properly \"translate\" a novel into its McCarthy version. As an example, let's take a certain scene from Pride and Prejudice. How about the one where Lady Catherine is quizzing Elisabeth about whether D'arcy has indeed proposed to her? They're alone, walking in the garden (although in the McCarthy version, they would be walking upon a windswept moor). Here we go:+++++++Dust clung to their boots and the tall grass shuddered on the frigid wind. A raven perched upon the fallen branch of an elm and watched them with one jet eye. Lady Catherines hands grasped nervously at nothing as she looked across the moor.Young women of unfortunate birth shouldnt attempt to reach beyond their station.What?Don't pretend you don't know of what I speak.Eliza spat and turned away. She walked into the doorway of a church. Inside dozens of bodies lay heaped upon the floor. Blood hard and dried like clay caked upon the stone of the floor. Flies traversed upon the eyelids of a child that stared blankly at Eliza who turned away.Los Muchachos estan muerto.Muerto?Muerto.Si.Eliza brushed her hair back. All of the constrictions you place upon mans actions are nothing to the ineffable stretch of the world which knows that all is war. No system of morality is anything but pretense which the least of gods vile beasts can shatter simply through the act of killing for its survival. Morality holds no water when it stands eye to eye with stark reality.Lady Catherine spat and wiped her mouth on her sleeve.Its damn cold.Wait which of us said that?I did. Oh. Alright.I wont promise I would never accept a proposal if I dont think its ever to be given. Nor can I swear as to what I would do in a situation that Ive never known myself to be in.Well arent you a contrary little whore. Lady Catherine spat. Ill not forget how youve treated me this day. Her finger moved closer to the knife that hung at her hip.++++++And here's one of the Bible's more memorable passages, McCarthyized:19:1 From out the dark sky over all Gods reckoning the two drifted like fallenleaves downward as Lot tipped back the widebrimmed hat, rubbing his thumb over stubble and spat on the grounddirt. Raising heavy to his feet and stretching he ambled forward dust raising an etherial plume in the nightair like ghosts of sinners dwelling on the threshold of the dark. the untamed past hovered there in the darkness by Sodom. 19:2 Come in ifn you want. We don't mind sleepin outside. No really I got plenty room. Cmon in. The angels came in bare feet on the packed dirt covered with indescribable years of footprints crisscrossed into an impossible to fathom reckoning of feet stretching back through indescribable years. So many feet and such a dirty floor. 19:3 He cooked bread. They warshed up and ate. 19:4 Out the window shadows encroached from the jet locustridden expanse of Sodom. Figures in stillness, nooses dangling from withered hands and that dust rising like the dead pounding from the other side of eternity trying to return trying to be unforsaken from the temporal purgatory the men dwelt in. Who them men we saw with them white robes. 19:5 Gone home, Jenkins, he said. Not til we know who them fugitives is you harborin. They aint niggers is they. Didn't you see they white robes. They aint no niggers. Lot walked out the house into that humidity the wind like the word of God drifting with threats of retribution and reckoning. Tell you what, men, you better get back on home and mind ya damn business. This aint no affair of yourn. The Willis boy had a strapon fixed to his forehead pointing up accusingly at the heavens an erection of defiance. He wore that collar that said Slave as always. He was danglin handcuffs from his hand like like a hypnotist without a pocketwatch. We just wanna see um. We just wanna meet um. Maybe have a little fun with um. 19:7 Lot spat a wad of nasal discharge loudly upon the earth and glanced back at the house. Tell you what boys. I invited them men into my house and I wont have them mistreated but I got them two good fer nothin daughters. You leave my visitors alone Ill bring them on out. 19:8 Willis nodded, that plastic tusk swaying in the nightair. What fer. Whatever yall find fittin. It aint fer me to say. Just leave my visitors alone. Okay, apparently it's not easy to write in Cormac McCarthy's style without sucking. I suppose the only way THE CORMAC MCCARTHY PROJECT can be effectively carried out is if McCarthy himself were to actually write these translations. So, if anyone runs into Cormac, let him know about this project, and how important it is for him to get to work right away. After all, there are lots of classics. I believe he lives in New Mexico. So, if you're wandering through a dark, dank cave and hear the sounds of typewriter keys pounding away, you've probably found his lair. Approach slowly, and don't make eye contact. I suppose, while I'm at it, I could say something about Blood Meridian. FUCKING AMAZING! I hate giving five star ratings, probably because I'm so curmudgeonly. But, for the third time, McCarthy is making me give him one. I just can't find anything to fault here, and the story is different from any I've ever read before. The writing is amazing, the characters are good (although the Judge fits a certain fiction stereotype, he's a very memorable version of it), and I was startled by the horror of it all . . . until I became numb to it. Which was the intention, or I think it was at any rate. This is the horrifying story of a group who are being paid to hunt down injuns and scalp them. Over time, the bloodlust of the group grows and they begin scalping those they're intended to be saving, and basically everyone they come across. When it comes time to be paid for the scalps, the scalps all look the same anyway. Sothey make tons of money from the indiscriminant slaughter of soldiers, villagers, travelers and everyone else. And, from there, things get uglier. This is all based on historical events, or so I've heard. I haven't researched it enough to know how closely. But, this is a very dark vision of the \"wild west,\" and the blood that was spilled while the land was still wild. If you have the stomach for it, this is an amazing book."}, {"userName": "Eric", "userReviewDate": "Apr 10, 2010", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/26852-eric", "userReview": "Fuck yeah. This is great. I felt fully absorbed and enclosed in the nightmare. I was scared. McCarthy at his very best commands some black and frightful reserves. To chose from so many scenes: Judge Holden under a ribcage parasol holding the halfwit by a leash, the two shuffling though the sun-bleached desert Golgotha bellowing threats and promises to Kid and Expriest who are hidden, cowering, \u201cprone in the lees of those sour bones like sated scavengers\u201d awaiting \u201cthe arrival of the judge and the passing of the judge if he would so pass.\" A classic is a book whose audacity and imagination overwhelm my presumption of judgment, my niggling page-by-page interrogation of stylistic choices. Everything bodied forth complete, final, and inevitable. I find no seam. ~Like Moby-Dick, Blood Meridian restores to us a proper fear at our planetary marooning and barrenness, our culture-making sacralization of bloody motions amidst an indifferent geology. Melville\u2019s \u201cThe Honor and Glory of Whaling\u201d heralds Judge Holden\u2019s \u201cWar is god\u201d soliloquy. \u2026all the land lay under darkness and all a great stained altarstone. ~But I do think that at present man is a predatory animal. I think that the sacredness of human life is a purely municipal ideal of no validity outside the jurisdiction. I believe that force\u2026is the ultima ratio, and between two groups that want to make inconsistent kinds of world I see no remedy except force. I may add what I no doubt have said often enough, that it seems to me that every society rests on the death of men\u2026 (Justice Holmes, letter to Sir Frederick Pollack, 1 February 1920)~\u201cMelville manages to keep it a real whaling ship, on a real cruise, in spite of all fantastics\u201d (D.H. Lawrence). So does McCarthy. Hence my fear. The world of Blood Meridian is at once recognizable, historical\u2014and a prehistoric void, the very birth of violence: The Yumas seemed immobilized by these misfortunes and the kid cocked the pistol and shot down another of their number before they began to collect themselves and move back, taking their dead with them, lofting a flurry of arrows and howling out bloodoaths in their stoneage tongue or invocations to whatever gods of war or fortune they\u2019d the ear of and retreating upon the pan until they were very small indeed.Even the horses looked alien to any they\u2019d ever seen, decked as they were in human hair and teeth and skin. Save for their guns and buckles and a few pieces of metal in the harness of the animals there was nothing about these arrivals to suggest even the discovery of the wheel.~The rough materials of spirit and form and idea\u2014the cities made from packed mud, the \u201crude Christ\u201d kissed by the villagers, \u201ca poor figure of straw with carven head and feet.\u201d ~ Holden, the metaphysical pessimist who practices what he preaches. Philosophizing and killing; meditating upon ruins and making them. A cold kiva of the Anasazi is his perfect lectern. ~McCarthy recommends that I go re-read Faulkner, by showing that rhapsodic run-ons can coexist with laconic pictorial precision. My unrevised undergraduate prejudice against Faulkner centers on mushmouthed prolixity. Perhaps an inevitable opinion when Absalom, Absalom! goes up against the revelation of Nabokov's suavity. ~The historical situation of Blood Meridian is a sweet spot. I love the Mexican War just a bit less than the Civil\u2014the former the bloody nursery of the latter. McCarthy\u2019s Glanton gang rides out in 1849, a year after the signing of the treaty that gave the US sparse and haphazard dominion over a land area greater than France and Germany together, an empire won by the tiny regular army supplemented with irregular settler militias, levees of war-hungry volunteers, deputations of rough riders and sundry freelance killers. The historical John Joel Glanton rode with the Texas Rangers during the war and made epic desert rides scouting for the army. Expriest mentions riding with Ben McCulloch\u2019s company of Ranger scouts, and the Kentuckian with whom Kid and Toadvine join the gang is a veteran of Doniphan\u2019s Ride, the 2,500 mile trek Missouri volunteers made through Northern Mexico, fighting Apaches and the Mexican army all the way. The war and its aftermath was the great age of the filibustero, the freebooter, the hired gun paid partly in plunder. It was a time when a band of Americans armed with rifles and the new six-shooters was thought invincible against mestizo conscripts with antique muskets and Indians with simple bows. During the 1850s bands of adventurers sallied forth from New Orleans, Mobile and San Francisco ambitious to reproduce the seizure of California in Cuba, Nicaragua and Baja. Some were picked up by the navy and set back; others made landfall and proclaimed brief chimerical kingdoms; and still others were captured and garroted in crowded plazas or stood against walls and shot down by squads of fusileros. This was neither the first nor the last of many American filibustering expeditions south of the border during the unquiet years following the Mexican War. The chronic instability and frequent overthrows of the government in Mexico City created power vacuums filled by bandit chieftains and gringo invaders who kept the border in a constant state of upheaval.

It is a book that I have had a hard time reading, one that upset me because of its brutality, its sadistic characters, and because of its graphic killings. I would pick it up and put it back down. I just could not make friends with it. But then I would come upon some of the most haunting prose, and I would think, like others have, I want to read it again and again. Someday. I just feel that I was not with the book; the book was with me, and yet, I hardly knew what was going on.Men gather upon horses to ride the southern parts of the U.S. just to find what they can slaughter, and what they slaughter is Mexicans and Indians. They meet their death in some very gruesome ways and scalps are gathered as trophies. And we once were told that it was the Indians who were really brutal; it was they who took the white man's scalps. It was only they. As I was reading this I have had to stop and get over scenes. The first where a kid went into a bar and when the bartender wouldn't serve him, he hit him over the head with a bottle, and then he gouged his eyes out with that broken bottle. Next, a man was handed a gun, and just for the fun of it he shot a few animals that were nearby. I put the book down again, and when I pick it up they are dashing babies against rocks, just like in the old testament when God's people dashed babies against rocks, and just like how the Christians dashed babies against the rocks during the Indian removal, just to shut them up. You don't get the bloody details in those other books, you do in McCarthy's. Basically, there was nothing right about this book except for its having great prose, and that it was loosely based on historical facts. The characters display no emotions when killing; in fact there are no emotions in this book except those which you wish to give it--those which you feel when reading it. \u201cA man's at odds to know his mind cause his mind is aught he has to know it with. He can know his heart, but he dont want to. Rightly so. Best not to look in there. It aint the heart of a creature that is bound in the way that God has set for it. You can find meanness in the least of creatures, but when God made man the devil was at his elbow. A creature that can do anything. Make a machine. And a machine to make the machine. And evil that can run itself a thousand years, no need to tend it.\u201d\u201cWar was always here. Before man was, war waited for him. The ultimate trade awaiting its ultimate practitioner.\u201d \u2015 Cormac McCarthyUpdate. This time I read it and understood every word. Something happens when you read graphic violence; it numbs you. Maybe it was that I was tired of it, and tired of the book, but I made myself listen, and I am glad that it is over with. I am glad that I read it as well. This is like a book that you read on a dare, you know, the dangerous dares that kids almost force other kids into doing. And I still think The Road is his best book, and second to that, Wilderness by Lance Weller. Neither were boring, nor were they filled with violence of this sort. And I grew tired of McCarthy's philosophizing. Still, it is a masterpiece. Adios.Update, January 2018: My Goodread friend DarwinBu put a link up of Harold Bloom's interview. Harold Bloom is a famous literally critic. https://www.avclub.com/harold-bloom-o...

I don\u2019t think I was feeling very well then anyway; my health was going through a bad time, and it was more than I could take. But it intrigued me, because there was no question about the quality of the writing, which is stunning. So I went back a second time, and I got, I don\u2019t remember\u2026 140, 150 pages, and then, I think it was the Judge who got me. He was beginning to give me nightmares just as he gives the kid nightmares. And then the third time, it went off like a shot. I went straight through it and was exhilarated. I said, \u201cMy God!

In Blood Meridian McCarthy writes about three or four wolves, calls them humans - those characters he bothers to name at all - and shows that with enough talent and powerful prose, a writer and his work can be called \"great\" without having to develop a single character in 330 pages.Among those who would be unsatisfied with the mere word \"great\" and have to go further in describing Blood Meridian, unbelievably enough, we find literary critic Harold Bloom. Mr. Bloom, who has published at least 1,000 pages that say irony and character development are the only measures of a major writer, is ridiculous in his praise, writing that Blood Meridian is \"clearly the major esthetic achievement of any living American writer.\"McCarthy is a writer of overpowering prose, no doubt. So overpowering, in fact, that where lesser writers would come to a moral dilemma and have to use it to shape a character somehow, McCarthy simply overpowers the story and character and reader with his prose. For this he's earned comparisons with everyone from Dante Alighieri to Homer to Melville to Faulkner. Frankly, he can have his comparisons to Faulkner, but he can't have Melville.The nearest McCarthy comes to Melville's Ahab is with his \"Judge\" character in Blood Meridian. But the Judge is about what Ahab would be if we didn't know he'd lost his leg, didn't spend 400 pages chasing his whale and just came to the last few pages of biblical soliloquies about Ahab thrusting his spear. The most McCarthy's willing to do for us in the way of character development is capture the Judge thrusting his spear over and over again - with newer and more accomplished and more grotesque depictions on each page.Why is the Judge thrusting his spear? Something about the permanence of war and violence. When it comes time for such explanations, McCarthy either offers us an indecipherable sermon of florid language from the Judge or provides an insight like this:\"For this will to deceive that is in things luminous may manifest itself likewise in retrospect and so by sleight of some fixed part of a journey already accomplished may also post men to fraudulent destinies.\" (p. 120)Even if McCarthy had been a touch less \"literary\" and actually employed punctuation that sentence would be incoherent.One needn't be a lazy reader to realize, quite early on, that there's little irony to be found in McCarthy's prose. Really, what we have in The Crossing, Cities of the Plain, Blood Meridian and The Road are travelogues written in a fierce American prose and offering some of the most beautiful depictions of gore in a century of literature.About that prose a different - and probably better - critic than Bloom, James Wood, memorably writes:\"(McCarthy) is an American ham. When critics laud him for being biblical, they are hearing sounds that are more often than not merely antiquarian, a kind of vatic histrionic groping, in which the prose plumes itself up and flourishes an ostentatiously obsolete lexicon. Blood Fustian, this style might be called.\"If one wants McCarthy's exact same landscapes populated with actual characters, creatures who think and converse and evolve, one is better off reading Larry McMurtry.And if one wishes to catch McCarthy doing honest-to-goodness storytelling, one is better off reading (or seeing) No Country for Old Men.Or, as an unnamed character in Blood Meridian, who goes by the moniker \"the kid\", thinks to explain things after 100,000 words of changing not one bit: \"I aint with you\" . . . at least not if you're saying this novel is the major American literary achievement of the last fifty years."}, {"userName": "Frank Maccormack", "userReviewDate": "Jun 08, 2008", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/341354-frank-maccormack", "userReview": "This book has moments of fleeting brilliance, and the last 50 pages of the book are almost flawless. However, there are 280 pages before that you have to read, which consist of, in my opinion, nothing more than barren landscapes, borderline shock-value accounts of depravity, and self-indulgent simile. It's a never-ending journey on the shoulders of quite possibly the most unlikable group of characters I've ever read, which in the hands of a particular writer, may work...McCarthy does NOT pull it off. When a reader spends an entire novel hoping the main characters die the worst death they can, it is almost NEVER an enjoyable situation. One cryptic and ominous character is interesting, but not enough to make me care what happens to any of the others. Don't get me wrong, I'm pretty sure I \"got\" what he was doing the whole time; but just because an epic philosophical subversion of American expansionism is attempted doesn't mean it is successful. It seems a lot of people love this, but I don't get the attraction. What people could see in this miserable story, I'll never know, when his later work like The Road is much more engaging and well paced.

If the above sentence made you clutch your breast and squeal in unabashed terror, you're gonna want to skip everything Cormac McCarthy writes. No use in aggravating yourself. McCarthy is an author's author. While people who do not write could likely marvel at what he manages in this novel, I think those who love and study the craft of writing will receive the most bang for their buck while reading this. For fuck's sake, guys, they teach this book at Yale and you have people out there who think the book is riddled with errors. Just go read some of the negative reviews. I'll wait...Blood Meridian, or the Evening Redness in the West is a masterclass in literary simplicity; simple language used to pitch-perfect effect. There is nothing superfluous about the contents. Every word has been chosen to place you in the moment. Yet, while the writing is simple, the prose is poetic. It is brutal poetry, but poetry nonetheless. And I quote:Dust stanched the wet and naked heads of the scalped who with the fringe of hair below their wounds and tonsured to the bone now lay like maimed and naked monks in the bloodslaked dust and everywhere the dying groaned and gibbered and horses lay screaming.The scene before this paragraph is astounding in its visuals, as is every act of violence, of which there are several, throughout the book. I found the cast of characters impressive as well. From the earless Toadvine to the hairless Judge (whose part in this tale seems much larger than I first imagined) to the quiet-and-violent kid, each character is subtly and passionately drawn, giving you just enough information so that you can tell them apart but never so much that you feel like McCarthy is demanding you imagine them one certain way. I love that. I don't like it when authors hold my hand. Give me the defining characteristic (a hairlip, a birthmark, a missing appendage, a lisp) and let me figure out the rest. I sat in awe, reading the final chapter. Not the Epilogue, but the chapter before it. Chapter 23 is filled with allegory, and the judge's role throughout the whole mess laid out for everyone to see but still cleverly hidden. He is dancing, dancing. He says that he will never die.In summation: This book will not be for everyone, especially not those Dickens-minded sorts that require a billion commas. And if you need quotation marks even though it is always clear who is speaking, then you should also skip this. Everyone else, I highly recommend this brutally-poetic and endlessly-bleak novel.

They\u2019re killing all who they encounter on their road, no matter, Indians, soldiers, villagers which they were to defend. They leave no witness of their crime and iniquity. Only blood and death behind them, and more blood. They ride like Bible Apocalypse Riders. Who are they ? Where do they ride ?They rode out on the north road as would parties bound for El Paso but before they were even quite out of sight of the city they had turned their tragic mounts to the west and they rode infatuate and half fond toward the red demise of that day, toward the evening lands and the distant pandemonium of the sun.Who are they then ? Glanton, leader of the gang, the earless Toadvine, black Jackson and white Jackson, ex-priest Tobin, the kid and Holden, the judge. The scalphunters. Glanton\u2019s gang , murderous troop sent out to Mexico-American borderlands to defend peasants really had existed and  Blood meridian is an epic story depicturing their nightmare odyssey. They\u2019re hunters, sometimes being hunted. Violence begins almost on the very first pages and continues to the very end. Massacre of the Tiguas, Slaughter of the soldiers, Scenes from a massacre, The murdered in the church, Night among the dead it\u2019s only some randomly chosen titles from the book. But McCormac doesn\u2019t overuse our endurance, doesn\u2019t shock for shocking itself. Some apt words and it\u2019s done. Death is always quick.One of the most intriguing person and undisputed leader is Judge Holden. He\u2019s a real nowhere man, enigmatic, ruthless, demonic. When he makes a speech on the desert he seems to be a mad war apostle. War was always here. Before man was, war waited for him. The ultimate trade awaiting its ultimate practitioner. That is the way it was and will be. That way and not some other way. War is the ultimate game because war is at last a forcing of the unity of existence. War is god.He appears in the most unexpected moment and all the time is trying to bend others to his own will. Seduces them . Who will resist ? The priest ? Ah Priest, what could I ask of you that you\u2019 ve not already given ? The kid ? There\u2019s a flawed place in the fabric of your heart, You alone were mutinous. You alone reserved in your soul some corner of the clemency for the heathen.Grotesque, huge, hairless albinos, in fact he looks like a caricature of a man. I\u2019m not even sure if he\u2018s a real man. But if not a man, then who? Personification of, of what ? Death, fate, time ? Evil itself ?I seen him before, said the kid. In Nacogdoches. Tobin smiles. Every man in the company claims to have encountered that sootysouled rascal in some other place.There is one more protagonist of that story. The nature. Rugged landscapes, majestic mountains, naked rocks ,vast prairie, wilderness. And the nature itself seems to be the only witness of all that carnage.That book knocked me down and then left completely stunned. And an ambiguous ending only deepend a feeling of being totally lost.He never sleeps, the judge. He is dancing, dancing.

Know what you are getting into before cracking this one open.It is the mid 1850's, and the Glanton Gang is riding roughshod over the countryside, giving no quarter to any living being. Indian scalps are at a premium. Join Toadvine, Bathcat, Tobin, the kid, and the judge out on the trail. I will never be able to get the judge out of my head. He is skewed, mad, evil to the very bone. And he dances . . . ."}, {"userName": "Szplug", "userReviewDate": "Nov 05, 2009", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/1843184-szplug", "userReview": "It seems that almost everybody raves about Blood Meridian and rates it the best novel written by Cormac McCarthy. I had already read three of his books prior to taking on Meridian; I was a fan, and regarded the book with a mixture of excitement and trepidation: excitement, because I had heard so many superlatives about it from other reviews - trepidation, for the exact same reason. It was with such conflicting expectations that I began; from word one the prose wasn't holding me for some reason, and I foolishly began to steel myself for a disappointment...up until about half a dozen pages in, when I beheld the first appearance of the magnetic Judge Holden: and then I knew that all those other enthusiasts were right on the money!Blood Meridian is a dark, debased, death-riddled and bone-dry reworking of the frontier myths of the American Dream into the American Nightmare. Whatever honour and nobility may have existed there has long fled to brighter realms, or been corrupted into an all-encompassing savagery, cruelty and greed; into the domain of the irrational, the lust for violence that endlessly threatens to assert its suzerainty. The Christian God does not reign over McCarthy's deserts and scrubland; this is the world of El Diablo, a place where magic works and the twinkle of the raven's eye forbodes of more death.The protagonist is a young drifter, known as the Kid, a cipher and everyman, who shows no real traces of pleasure or disgust, eagerness or reluctance at the depravities undertaken by the gang of Indian scalp-hunters that he ends up joining after a prior military expedition into Mexico - led by the na\u00efve and glory-hungry Captain White - comes to disaster against a savage band of Comanches. This gang is led by the ruthless and taciturn Glanton, and guided by the aforementioned Judge Holden - surely the most intriguing and disturbing character in this novel of wretched humanity - as they routinely set about collecting Apache scalps for bounties offered by the Mexican authorities. After making themselves unwanted by their excesses, the gang heads into the Sonora desert to make for the Pacific Coast - and to scourge the land they pass through like locusts sent by a vengeful Deity.McCarthy is a master at describing stark and areolated wildernesses, the amoral majesty of nature, the quick bite of violence, and at depicting conversation between hard-bitten men; and he delivers it all in spades in Meridian. Other than a few tumbleweeds at the beginning, and spots here and there at the ferry crossing, the book is flawless, reaching its greatest level during a surreal telling of how the gang found (or were found by) the Judge. The ending seems utterly apropos, considering all that had gone before it. Dantesque and infernal, full of sound and fury, a five-star masterpiece from one of America's greatest living writers."}, {"userName": "Michael", "userReviewDate": "Apr 24, 2017", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/65909643-michael", "userReview": "I love McCarthy's early work.

And these are people I like; people who have my back (bibliophilisticly speaking).\u00bb The prose is like nothing I\u2019ve read before. It\u2019s elaborate, but not fussy. No flourish need apply. And I swear he just makes words up if the standard ones in English seem too refined. The effect is just right for a seared earth adventure. It grew on me.\u00bb See if you can tell from the pattern of my recent reads what I was due for next: Pride and Prejudice, The Long Ships (the epic Viking adventure story), Mrs. Bridge, ???. It was time to swing back towards testosterone.Reasons to stop:\u00bb August weather did ultimately arrive here in Chicago. Did I really want to read a book set in the blazing hot, dusty expanses of Texas and Mexico?\u00bb It took very few pages to figure the violence would not be giving up center stage. The 14-year-old kid from Tennessee was born for it, enjoyed it as a form of recreation, and had a knack for doing it well. I can\u2019t remember if killing and maiming was literally \u201cat the drop of a hat,\u201d but it might as well have been. To what end, I wondered? Was it just part and parcel of westward expansion? How much was just a Cormac McCarthy fetish?\u00bb The library copy I was reading was dingy, dog-eared and probably full of some sociopath\u2019s DNA who was reading this as a \u201cHow to\u201d book.I\u2019m not saying I won\u2019t come back; I\u2019m just saying you have to be in the mood."}, {"userName": "Aaron", "userReviewDate": "Jul 29, 2007", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/233448-aaron", "userReview": "I don't get people's love affair with this book. It's like if Kill Bill, Vol. 1 was consistently trumpeted as the greatest movie of all time. They both are cartoonish exercises in violence. They both are a pastiches of high and low art. They both have one stunning scene that wins over the critics (the Indian attack in Blood Meridian, the snow duel in Kill Bill) and then feel pretty flat for the remainder. And yet, Blood Meridian has become a darling of critics and now, with McCarthy's Oprah-approved status, readers too. I guess one big difference is that Kill Bill's violence and appropriation doesn't seem to have any central idea driving it, where Blood Meridian clearly does -- it's just that I can't figure out what that point is. And I haven't found any analysis of it (it's a gnostic text; it's a reformulation of America's history of violence as a new Bible; whatever) convincing. Maybe I can learn a lesson from the Kid, and come to terms with my not getting it by stoically spitting. A lot."}], "description": "An epic novel of the violence and depravity that attended America's westward expansion, Blood Meridian brilliantly subverts the conventions of the Western novel and the mythology of the \"wild west.\" Based on historical events that took place on the Texas-Mexico border in the 1850s, it traces the fortunes of the Kid, a fourteen-year-old Tennesseean who stumbles into the nightmarish world where Indians are being murdered and the market for their scalps is thriving.Publisher's Note: The 25th Anniversary Edition has been reset, causing the text to reflow.
