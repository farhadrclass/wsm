The Anomaly series is a great military sci-fi series, that I feel can be enjoyed by urban fantasy readers and sci-fi readers alike. The heroine effectively has supernatural powers that make her one of the best soldiers in the Known Universe making her seem a lot like urban fantasy heroine.SHADES OF HONOR keeps all the things I loved about about SHADES OF TREASON, everything from the intense battles and political intrigue to the great romance subplot. SHADES OF HONOR adds to that including an epic chase scene and a lot of great character development. SHADES OF TREASON spent most of the time devoted to characters just introducing them, this allows SHADES OF HONOR to actually take time to develop the characters know that you are familiar with them. Sandy Williams put a lot of effort into really fleshing out Ash and Rip in SHADES OF HONOR, and I'm eager to see how they continue to develop in the next book.My only problem with SHADES OF HONOR is the same one I had with SHADES OF TREASON. And I even had reason to believe it would be avoided too. About halfway through the book Ash and Rip talk about how stupid it was for them to have sex when they were literally being chased down by an enemy force. So I thought the sex scene in this book wouldn't be so stupid. But it still was. When Ash and Rip should be getting ready for an op only minutes away, they decide that is a good time to have sex, and in the armory of all places. I'm sure others won't have a problem with this, but it really makes it hard for me to suspend my disbelief.In the end, what made SHADES OF HONOR such an amazing book for me was that it actually made me laugh on multiple occasions. So if nothing else I said piqued your interest maybe that does. SHADES OF HONOR isn't a \"hard science\" science fiction novel. SHADES OF HONOR focuses on character and world development, so you don't have to worry about pages and pages of technical information. SHADES OF HONOR is just an amazing story that takes place in space, and I highly recommend it.One sex scene"}, {"userName": "Sunny", "userReviewDate": "Dec 29, 2016", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/1022402-sunny", "userReview": "ARC Review to come"}, {"userName": "Camille", "userReviewDate": "Oct 20, 2016", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/12504360-camille", "userReview": "[yet again failed to get their hands on it.

I can't get enough of Ash and Rip! Ash and Rip are on a new mission together, with Rip as her superior officer and told to keep his distance from her. Ash is vital to the mission and Rip has to keep her safe whilst keeping his professional and personal relationship with her in balance. Ash is seen as unstable, volatile and dangerous and she has to deal with the prejudices that come with being an anomaly. She is not one to follow rules and is not afraid to speak her mind - definitely not the person to have on a delicate diplomatic mission. In Rip's own words - she is infuriatingly reckless, beautifully unpredictable, and undeniably addicting. This is my favourite in the series so far - we get to meet Rip's family, and learn more about Rip and Ash's pasts. There is plenty of character development as we get to see them outside their comfort zones, and see their strengths and vulnerabilities. They are both strong, determined characters and their dynamics are fascinating. I became completely involved in this book - it was so intense, filled with intriguing characters, sizzling romance, nail-biting action and a thrilling, unpredictable plot. I\u2019ve fallen head over heels in love with Ash & Rip and their world, and I cannot wait to continue on with this series!"}, {"userName": "Shelley", "userReviewDate": "Nov 09, 2016", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/3081722-shelley", "userReview": "*Source* Amazon Kindle*Genre* Science Fiction, Romance*Rating* 4.0*MY THOUGHTS*Shades of Honor, by author Sandy Williams, is the second installment in the Anomaly series.

Lieutenant Ramie Ashdyn is a tough as nails anomaly who has fallen hard for Commander Rhys Rykus, who is her fail-safe and supposedly has total control over her, since she\u2019s been brainwashed by the Coalition. Ash fights Rip's influence at every turn, and enjoys giving him a hard time whenever she can, and he wouldn\u2019t have her any other way. He\u2019s supposed to keep his distance from her, but they end up on a mission where they\u2019ll have to work together to keep the minister prime safe, and it is harder and harder to resist giving in to their feelings and be together. Ash must also deal with the complication of an attempt on her life, the telepath threat, dealing with the other anomalies on the ship, and her difficulty in integrating into a new team after the deaths of everyone on her old team. Life is more complicated than ever, and it was a pleasure watching these two navigate through all the danger and make it through mostly in one piece. I loved all the action as well as Ash\u2019s interaction with Rip and her new teammates. This is such a fantastic series, I can\u2019t wait to read the next story to find out what happens next."}, {"userName": "Nevada", "userReviewDate": "Dec 12, 2016", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/29114908-nevada", "userReview": "This is the writer that hooked me on her Shadow Reader series. It has almost everything I love about her writing style. And supporting characters a-plenty here, I really missed them last book. Funnily, Ash is not happy to have a cast of supporting characters again, she's too busy trying to keep a wall up around herself to be happy to have a group of people care about her again. Can you say \"insular\"?Ash and Rip are my favorite character couple to be annoyed with right now. Seriously, Ash & Rip are a perfect fit for each other, they're both grindstones that would pulverize anyone else less strong they tried to be with, but with each other they are able to hold their own. Neither one of them is needy or mushy or incapable, a little bit broken but they understand their own particular type of broken. And it certainly doesn't hurt that they're two strong and fit people who are quite easy on the eyes (I imagine). So, of course, they spend half the fricking book tortured by their love, remembering and alluding to the steamy, three day bonk-fest they had before the book starts and now must not at any costs be repeated where the reader can enjoy because they're on a mission together. le sigh. Don't get me wrong, a little sexual tension is good, but come on, why do they have to take two steps back? No more Ross and Rachel; no more Ted and Robin; no more Olivia and Fitz/Jake; just be together and be happy and bone dammit!The action (aside from the eventual horizontal action) was great. This book really didn't take a breath. When people weren't punching each other there were space battles, when there weren't space battles there was parental hostility, when there wasn't parental hostility there was political manuevering and intrigue that led to more battles. Loved it. It was great to see Ash and Rip interact together and separately with a whole new group of people, and see how those dynamics developed.One thing I missed that Williams does so well is banter. I feel like the dialogue was a lot more tense and serious (which is appropriate for the book) than her typical writing. I missed the witty repartee that was so prevalent in Shadow Readers, but I have to make peace with the fact that Ash and Rip aren't really the jokester types, there more the toss-a-grenade-behind-you-as-you-jump-off-a-cliff-and-figure-out-the-landing-plan-on-the-way-down kind of people, and I'm okay with that.I'm totally looking forward to book 3. It kind of pains my pride to say this, but I don't know where book 3 will take us in the story. I don't know how she's going to tie together Glory, and Sariceans, and telepaths, and mob bosses to resolve our plot but I can't wait to find out.For the love of all things holy Sandy, stop reading review and write!

I loved the characters especially the new side characters that were introduced in this book. Sandy Williams is great at writing really likable characters.Ash is still my favourite character of the series. I liked seeing the more emotional side of her that is dealing with the things that happened in the first book. But what I liked most about her character in this book was that she was still witty and confident whilst trying to handle her emotions.I liked Rykus' character a lot more in this book because we got to know a lot more about his background and his relationship with his father.I really enjoyed the storyline, it was just as action packed as the first but this time you get to see more of a political side of things with the relationships of the planets which was really interesting.I feel like I got a better understanding of the universe/worlds in this book. I liked finding out different things about each planet and I'm excited to read more about them.Overall I loved this book. I think it's a great sequel and I can't wait for the next book in the series."}, {"userName": "Lesley", "userReviewDate": "Jan 10, 2017", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/4204126-lesley", "userReview": "3.5 StarsIf you enjoyed Shades of Treason, then Shades of Honor will not disappoint. This story picks up where the first book left off, following Ash and Rykus as they navigate political intrigue and family drama, shoot their way out of deadly situations, and continue to get it on at very inappropriate times/places (facepalm).

Shades of Honor, picks up a short time after the end of the previous book. Ash, our fantastic heroine, is once again giving her new team a hard time. We learned in the first book that Ash can be difficult to get along with, as she is very tough, brash and independent. She is an Anomaly, a human who is smarter mentally and physically than the normal person, which makes her an elite soldier, who is faster, stronger, with phenomenal endurance then the regular soldiers.Rykus, our hero, is facing charges concerning the last mission, but all charges are dropped, since he is being assigned another dangerous mission. Both Ash and Rykus love each other, but they try to keep their distance, as the Coalition will not accept their relationship. Much to his concern, Rykus finds out the mission will include Ash, which will make it much more difficult for him to concentrate.The minister prime, Tersa, has put the team together to try and make peace with the evil Sariceans, who caused massive destruction in a recent attack. Rykus and the entire team, including Ash are not happy about this mission, but Tersa will not be denied.What follows is an exciting & fun adventure that will bring Ash a bit closer to her new team; solidify Ash & Rykus love for each other, despite his attempts to keep his distance; and an all out battle that will put all their lives in danger. Who will survive? Will Ash and Rykus find a way to keep their romance hot and heavy?Sandy Williams does a fantastic job in continuing the flow of this complex world , and she has created some great characters. Most of all, I love Ash, and her chemistry with Rykus is off the wall. I look forward to more of this fabulous romance. This was a fun, exciting, pulse pounding story that had me unable to put the book down, especially as we raced to the tense climax. Bravo to Sandy Williams, for another wonderful addition to her Anomaly series. If you like Sci-fi, lots of action, great romance, and twists and turns along the way, than you should be reading this series.BarbThe Reading Cafe"}, {"userName": "Sandra", "userReviewDate": "Dec 27, 2016", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/3161958-sandra", "userReview": "Again I really enjoyed this second instalment in terms of action, plot and characters but I am still really uncomfortable with their relationship and the whole loyalty training/brainwashing aspect.

We get to see some of RIP's background and interaction with his family. We learn a little bit more about anomalies and I particularly liked the interaction between them all - having two in the same room together seems like a bad idea. The character of Ash - oh my. I thought the author did a great job of highlighting both the intensity of her character as well as the many issues that make her crazy and broken. It was nice to see that there was some thought put into the consequences of her experiences in the last book. She wasn't just ok after all that. While I like the two main characters I thought the sexual tension distracted from the story here and there. I think it was intricate to the story and well written for the most part but there was a lot of it. Other than that and a few loose ends which I'm hoping will come up in the next story in line (Ash's run-in with Brookins, her involvement with Taya, and teaching Teal how to fight), I thought this was a great read.
