So I was very excited to sink my teeth into (no zombie pun intended) Eat Slay Love by Jesse Petersen and read it in just a few days.Picking up where Flip This Zombie left off, Sarah and David are making their way to the Midwest wall in hopes of passing off the vial of the cure they\u2019ve procured. But the journey is much easier said than done since they have to stick to local roads (zombie and car crash filled highways are just too risky) and find supplies along the way. Sarah and David\u2019s marriage, which was rocky when we first met them, is intact but Sarah has a sense of worry over losing David \u2013 who was bite, but cured, by a zombie.Her fears aren\u2019t irrational either. Suddenly David is lifting nearly double his weight, sleeping less and overall is a bit more bad ass than before. While Sarah struggles with this they end up saving a tabloid TV reporter who joins them on their trip to the wall to film it all.Just when the three think they\u2019ve left the crazy cults behind on the West Coast they run into one down south. A shocking discovery is made about David in the process of their escape from the cult. While Sarah fights to keep the secret of the cure from their TV reporter friend, it becomes harder and harder. Especially when a former rock legend now turned some-what-recovering addict joins them. Now, the four kick it into gear and aim to make it to the Midwest wall before any cults (or zombies) can get a hold of them.The last 50 pages or so are completely addicting and left me turning the pages at record speed to find out what happens. While the ending gives a bit of closure, enough so that I\u2019m wondering if there will be a 4th Living With The Dead. While Eat Slay Love could work as the final book, I can\u2019t help but want more of Sarah and David\u2019s adventures. Heck I\u2019d even read a \u201cLife After Living With The Dead\u201d book. Who wouldn\u2019t want to see Sarah back at work pulling a gun on a co-worker who sneaks up on her? Overall, fans of Living With The Dead will find themselves loving Eat Slay Love. Which, in my opinon, may just be the best book in the series.Book Rating: 10/10"}, {"userName": "C.R.

I am glad that their marriage was saved by the Apocalypse. I found the TV reporter a tad annoying, but I loved the addition of the rock star. So funny. They run into another cult could you imagine.

Sarah and David are slowly making their way toward the Wall, with the zombie cure- hoping that it actually exists!In route to the Wall, they happen across Nicole Nessing (a TV star from before) running from a pack of zombies.

Dave and Sarah are married you see, and just before the zombie apocalypse they were on the verge of divorce. But nothing brings you together more than the world around going to shit and Sarah and Dave found their love for one another growing again, and surprisingly they made a pretty good team.However, with the second book \u2018Flip the Zombie\u2019 the humour was missing for me which made the book a little darker. Normally I love dark and gritty urban fantasies but since I fell in love with the snark and Dave and Sarah\u2019s lighthearted married couple banter I was disappointed when I found it lacking.Unfortunately, \"Eat Slay Love\" has gone the other way. There is way too much snark, innuendo and jokes that I felt saturated by it. Nearly every paragraph Sarah is making some quip or smart alek comment and after a while it just had my eyes rolling and started to get on my nerves.But despite this irritation of Sarah\u2019s I still liked her, she is kinda funny and sometimes the comedic moments were spot on and brought a smile to my lips. There\u2019s also plenty of action and suspense, and with the addition of two other characters, Nicole, a reporter and McKray, a washed out rock star, there are lots of great interactions and the dynamics between these four was great to read.After being bitten by a zombie at the end of book two, David is finding that he isn\u2019t quite the same \u2013 he\u2019s slightly different. Sarah is noticing all sorts of things such as his increased hunger, increased strength and the fact that the zombies don\u2019t seem to want to eat him. While dealing with these disturbing revelations, their small group is also taken by another cult, which of course they have to escape from as well as avoiding the zombies who want to munch on their brains.VERDICT:\u201cEat Slay Love\u201d is fun reading and great for a quick entertaining read. It\u2019s not quite up to par with the first book, but definitely better than the second. I\u2019m sad to hear that Orbit have now dropped the series, I think Sarah and Dave still had quite a few stories to tell - at least the series ended on a high note."}, {"userName": "Jaki ", "userReviewDate": "Jun 10, 2011", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/1158-jaki", "userReview": "I knew nothing about Jesse Petersen, nor had I ever heard of this book. I didn\u2019t know her style, what she wrote about, or anything else she had written.Ten pages into Eat Slay Love and I was absolutely kicking myself that I had not discovered her earlier. What the heck had I been doing that I was completely oblivious to this funny, witty, absolutely delightful series about a married couple living through the zombie apocolypse?? This is the third book in the Living with the Dead series, and as soon as I had finished it, I was on the phone to my local bookstore ordering the first two. The remarkable thing is that while this is the third about David and Sarah, I had no troubles at all following it. I wasn\u2019t confused or lost, not having read the first two. You can definitely read this without having read the others.Sarah would probably be my favourite kick-ass heroine to date. Seriously. She has no special powers, no superstrength and she doesn\u2019t talk to ghosts \u2013 but by god, she can kick zombie ass when she needs to.David and Sarah are my new heroes. I just adored them. And here we\u2019ve got a bit of romance, but there\u2019s no love triangle between the lead heroine and two broody alpha males \u2013 they\u2019re married! I can\u2019t tell you how refreshing that was! Snarky, sarcastic, funny\u2026.honestly I can\u2019t say enough good things about this series. The characterization is absolutely spot-on. I actually laughed out loud in quite a few places. Seeing the zombie apocolyptic world through Sarah\u2019s eyes almost had me hoping for the real thing \u2013 cos believe me, I\u2019d be trying to channel Sarah if it happens!!!This is a book I will award 5 out of 5 to, and that\u2019s rare. It\u2019s only happened to me a couple of times this year so far \u2013 I\u2019ve read a lot of fantastic books, but to go all out and give it the Big 5 Stars doesn\u2019t happen very often at all. But this book\u2026.oh peoples, go out and BUY it\u2026NOW!If you love zombies, if you love strong tough independant and FUNNY heroines, if you\u2019re tired of the same ol\u2019 same ol\u2019 kick-ass heroine with the issues and baggage and having to decide between two alpha males\u2026you are going to LOVE this series."}, {"userName": "VampireNovelFan", "userReviewDate": "Feb 07, 2011", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/4897902-vampirenovelfan", "userReview": "A series where each new book is better than the last.\nThe Living with The Dead series should be a sitcom. It\u2019d be the anti-The Walking Dead. I don\u2019t know what it is about these books, be it the current pop culture references or that Shaun of the Dead/Zombieland kind of feel, but I really like them. The lines are genuinely funny, there\u2019s plenty of action and zombie gore, and it\u2019s a perfect length for this kind of story. In short, it certainly packs a punch (or in this case, a shotgun). If you want a departure from the usual drama-filled and highly sexualized urban fantasy series, then this one comes highly recommended. Peterson writes in prose, making it very easy to visualize what\u2019s happening so that the comedy translates better. What\u2019s also good about these books is that you don\u2019t really need to read the previous novels to understand the story. Sure, it does enrich the experience, but Peterson throws reminders out there at just the right time so that it isn\u2019t a distraction or an annoyance. This helps a lot with flow and decent plot progression.I will say that if you\u2019ve read the prior novels, it is starting to become a tad predictable in terms of their companions that they meet along the way. It\u2019s no longer a \u201cwill they disband?\u201d rather it\u2019s now a \u201cwhen will they disband?\u201d I do rather like some of the characters we\u2019ve met so I don\u2019t always want to see them go.

And after enjoying the hell out of the other two, I couldn't wait to get stuck into this one.Sarah and David now have a new mission--they've got the zombie cure and are making their way towards the Wall to make sure it gets into the right hands. Sure, there might not even be a Wall, but it's worth the effort. So they continue to trek across the country, stumbling on other survivors along the way. Here, they meet up with an annoying reporter on a mission, and a doped-up rocker. But not before nearly being killed by some radical rednecks who want to teach them a lesson.Oh, and there's the David-having-super-strength thing. And the zombies-don't-detect-David thing. Both seem to be side effects after receiving a dose of the cure himself, and definitely prove to be very handy.This is another hilarious, fast-paced addition to a series that I've grown very attached to. It's got a bit of everything--hungry zombies, lots of zombie shooting, plenty of funny banter, some sad moments, some happy moments, and some darn-scary moments. Besides, Sarah and David are so likeable, I'm very sad to see them go. I can't believe the publisher dropped this series.

She always gets caught or pinned by zombies and ALWAYS needs help. The whole time say \"I'm no longer squeamish\" then turns around and acts squeamish. Or \"I'm no longer surprised by zombies\" Then turns around and gets surprised and nearly bitten like she just started fighting instead of months under her belt AND always has excuse after axcuse of why she sucks so bad after boasting how good she is.. Finally I thought in this book that you know David seems to have some kool powers, Zombies avoid him, super strength, doesn't feel pain. But wait a minute he's not the star of these dame books! sarah is still weak and submissive \"I know better than to argue when he has a plan...\" she doesn't even have a back bone! The first book started out great (If they argues she's stand toe to toe, now she just nods like a dick whipped woman) but got crappier and crappier from there, and by this book its apparent David is the dominate one between them, he makes the decisions, she follows.

Insomma, Sarah si ritrova tra la preoccupazione che suo marito si trasformi in uno zombie da un momento all\u2019altro, alla diffidenza verso il nuovo acquisto del gruppo; Nicole, una reporter, e lo stress nel portare avanti il loro piano e raggiungere il Muro dove poter condividere la cura in modo da salvare l\u2019umanit\u00e0.Come al solito, i problemi saranno tanti e non semplici di affrontare.

The story automatically picks up from where it left off with David just barely being saved from becoming a zombie himself.The same funny comments that I\u2019ve become to expect from Jesse Petersen did not disappoint either; however, I do wish that she would change up the story a bit. It\u2019s always: keep heading towards the Wall, pick up supplies, kill some zombies, find some weird random human that will eventually die, find crazy people and get kidnapped, escape from crazy people, continue heading towards the Wall.Nicole\u2019s character, well\u2026 I kept hoping she\u2019d hurry up and get eaten. She was obviously some dumb blonde bimbo and what was up with her constantly doing sexual favors for everyone?

I'll round up based on the first two. \"Whatever, all\u2019s fair in love and zombies.\"\"Eat, Slay, Love\" ends Jesse Petersen's cute little 'Living with the Dead' trilogy (I understand there's perhaps an additional 4th (e-)book but can't find it anywhere). However, after spending less than my alloted reading time for JUST 2 DAYS on this painfully short 3-chapter collection of pamphlets, I really felt the author had run out of gas and all the momentum was gone by the time I closed the last page. This is easily the weakest of the 3 books with the usual strong characterizations and humor from the first 2 books being mostly absent.\"ESL\" has so much potential but too much was just glanced over and quickly set off to the side that it became almost, I don't know, awkward. You just get the feeling the author regretted having to finish it or even having started it! Even the crazy cult-scene which had so much potential was far too brief - particularly taking into account the importance of same to the overall plot - and the ending rushed and ultimately unsatisfying. I think if I hadn't become emotionally invested in Sarah and Dave by the end I wouldn't have even rated it as high as I did. But they survived and yay, anyone up for FroYo? But what the heck, right? Not the worst books I've ever read and I have to admit to still being bummed that JP is no longer writing (again, as far as I can tell as all explanations and the links to same are long since gone).

We follow Sarah and David on their journey as they push themselves to their physical and emotional limits while avoiding being torn apart by hordes of zombies. As they travel across the country in search of the safety of the Midwest Wall, David and Sarah will run into more obstacles than just the living dead which will test the bond between them and their trust of others. In a chaotic frenzy to reach sanctuary and alert masses of people within the wall of a potential cure, Sarah and David barely survive with the help of some friends and family and are able to succeed in their mission. Petersen's purpose in this novel was mainly to entertain the audience as well as bring her Living with the Dead series to a close. The overall feeling one gets from this novel is wild, quirky, and dramatic. The intended audience is likely aimed at young adults and anyone older as it's theme, while told in a bit of a silly way sometimes, can get quite serious. Star Gazing: Overall I'd give the book 4 stars because it kept me on an emotional roller coaster and kept me giggling all the way through. It also does a pretty good job of keeping you in the loop with what happened in the two previous novels so you aren't lost, which was great since I read these out of order! Cover Story: I have to admit that the cover was a tad disappointing considering the amount of action, turmoil, and romance that takes place in the book. However the image does convey the central theme of the book in albeit in a more concise way. I'd give it a solid 6 maybe 7 out of 10 for the 'punny' title. Believe It or Not: I'd have to give this a C in terms of whether the events in this were truly realistic. Obviously there's the fact that this novel centers itself around the two protagonists surviving a zombie apocalypse which is itself something out of science fiction. However the way which the main characters react to many of the tragic or life-threatening events that occur to them does redeem some of the more unrealistic action sequences. Lessons Learned: This novel seems to be more for entertainment purposes than to teach morals, but the lesson here (at least to me) was to trust those close to you and to always stand by them even in the worst of times. If one does this then the trust will be returned, creating a stronger relationship or bond. Casting Call: A.) Hugh Dancy as DavidHugh Dancy is best known (at the moment) for his role as Will Graham on NBC's Hannibal. His physical appearance on the show best matches what I believe David to look like in the novel considering the duo is constantly moving and likely have unkempt appearances. However I feel he'd have a more muscular body type as Sarah mentions in the beginning of the novel due to his \"partial-zombie\" status. Personality-wise, Hugh Dancy himself also seems to fit into the character of David who is a cheery, optimistic, fun-loving type.B.) Emily Browning as SarahEmily Browning, known for her lead role in the film Sucker Punch, captures the image of Sarah that I'd like to see portrayed. The more gritty yet still lighthearted woman she is. Although I picture her looking a bit more mature than she does in Sucker Punch, she fits the character nicely. Someone kind and devoted, but who can still crush zombie skulls or escape from a tricky situation if she needs to. Preach or Ditch?: Despite it being one of the dorkiest things I've read in a while, I'd definitely preach this to every single one of my friends. This is something that you'd read casually one day, but quickly develop a huge obsession for once you were 10 pages in. Despite some heavy scenes the overall book was lighthearted and very fun to read. My favorite part had to be the sarcastic chapter titles that made me giggle every time I got further into the novel. Of course I'd recommend reading the series in order as you'd probably get more enjoyment out of the novel is you did, but I don't believe it's necessary since the author does a great job of summarizing the events prior to the book quite well, where the reader can fill in the gaps easily along the way."}, {"userName": "Elisa ", "userReviewDate": "Mar 05, 2017", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/5133558-elisa", "userReview": "Well, I enjoyed this zombie trilogy about a husband and wife zombie slaying team. It was zombie \"light\" but still filled with plenty of grossness, blood, goo and death and destruction and lots of humor. Read them in order, a nice check to see if you like zombie fiction or a good break away from all the mayhem of the hardcore stuff."}, {"userName": "TheBookSmugglers", "userReviewDate": "Jul 21, 2011", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/1223249-thebooksmugglers", "userReview": "Originally Reviewed on The Book Smugglers: http://thebooksmugglers.com/2011/07/b...Sarah and David have survived the initial outbreak. They\u2019ve survived the journey south from Seattle to Phoenix. They\u2019ve survived a mad scientist, his unlikely offspring, and even a zombie bite (thanks to said mad scientist\u2019s mad cure). Now, with a vial of the precious serum that could save the vestiges of humanity in hand, Sarah and David leave the southwest and make their gradual way towards the Midwest in hopes of reaching the rumored Wall, behind which there is supposedly a working government\u2026and no infection. Of course, getting to Illinois is no easy feat with hundreds of miles of zombieland in front of them \u2013 and when they begin to pick up a pair of straggling survivors (a perky former entertainment news anchor and a drug-addicted has-been rockstar), things only get more complicated.And then there\u2019s the pesky matter of David\u2019s increasing strength, invisibility to zombies, and freaky sleeping habits to contend with\u2026Eat Slay Love is, I am sad to say, the final book in the Living with the Undead series by Jesse Petersen.1 As with the prior book in the trilogy, Flip This Zombie, Eat Slay Love is a departure from the relationship snark of Married with Zombies and more plot centric, as our favorite zombie-busting duo make their way towards a hope for future civilization in the east. The story this time takes the couple down a road filled with more crazy villager-cultist-types that have a sweet Jabba the Hut type dungeon pit (filled with zombies to devour unlucky prisoners, naturally), an irritatingly pretty and surprisingly intelligent and conniving reporter, and a full-fledged evil military government (complete with an opposing underground resistance movement). Ms. Petersen\u2019s writerly superpower seems to be her ability to use tried and done tropes, and yet somehow keeps readers engaged and excited to find out what happens next. I\u2019m still not quite sure as to how she does this. Perhaps it\u2019s the level of action in the story, with Sarah and David constantly on the move and staving off enemies both living and undead. Perhaps it\u2019s the delightful gory details of the zombie plague and the ravaged countryside?Actually, while all of these things are pretty good, the best thing about Eat Slay Love and the series overall is the snappy dialogue and interplay between main couple Sarah and David. You want pop culture drops that range from Alicia Keyes to Star Wars? Look no further. I love that in this final book, the relationship between our intrepid duo is severely tested, and not by some emotional BS or the usual marital issues. David\u2019s prolonged reaction to being bitten by a zombie and the cure that saved him from becoming one changes everything for the couple \u2013 in both good and terrifying ways. Sarah\u2019s fear at losing her husband for good is palpable throughout the book, and I love seeing how their relationship has grown from the stunted angry thing in book 1 to the level of trust shown in book 3.Beyond the serious stuff, as always, Sarah\u2019s narration is hilarious, biting, and insightful. This last book builds up to a crescendo of action and high-stakes, but ends in a way that is both satisfying for now, but could promise more books. I\u2019ll miss Sarah and David dearly, and I\u2019ll be keeping my fingers crossed that there will be more from my favorite Zombiebusters in the future."}, {"userName": "Shelley", "userReviewDate": "Apr 20, 2011", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/3081722-shelley", "userReview": "Rating: 4.0 starsGenre: Dystopian Fantasy/Science FictionEat Slay Love, by Jesse Petersen, is the third book in the Living with the Dead series. Sarah and David have been through hell and back after surviving the zombie apocalypse and escaping from Seattle where the infestation started. Along the way, they have stumbled across cults, mad scientists and other groups who have tried to kill them. Now, they intend to do everything they can to reach the Midwest Wall where they hope to find survivors, including Sarah\u2019s mother Molly, and safety from the massive zombie outbreak that has spread all over the Badlands (the West).It has been more than a month since David was bitten by a zombie after coming into contact with a mad scientist who also had a cure. Sarah has been having nightmares of him turning zombie and her shooting him dead. Thanks to the cure, David hasn't turned, nor does he desire to eat anyone\u2019s brains. But, he's not exactly normal either. His strength has more than doubled, he needs more and more food to keep him from going hungry and he can walk among the zombies without being attacked. Sarah calls him the Zombie Whisperer.Sarah, as always, is sarcastic, funny, and witty, as well as a little worried that the infection will end up costing David his life. She absolutely loves her guns and toys she picks up along the way, and by the end of the story, she has an even better toys to play with. Think really big guns.Along the way to the wall, the couple meets up with a reporter named Nicole Nessing who worked for ENZ \u2013 Entertainment News Zone (Think TMZ). She was down in Mexico when the outbreak started, and since then has been hearing things about the couples exploits from various survivor camps. Sarah calls her a stalkerazzi, and truly hates her when they first meet. They also meet Colin McCray, who is the lead singer of Lead Tongue who decided to remain locked up in a hospital in Oklahoma. Colin definitely is should have been tossed to the zombies, but I digress.Nothing is ever easy for Sarah, David and crew. They once again face a test of survival by a group who have come together to keep out the infected and other survivors. Call it Mad Max and the Thunderdome if you will. Eventually, they do reach the Midwest wall, but nothing is as it appears. In fact, it appears that the government is doing its best to ignore the situation in the Badlands.I love the fact that Sarah and David have remained married throughout the zombie infestation; in fact, they\u2019ve actually grown closer in every way possible. While others are struggling to survive, Sarah and David ended up making zombie killing a business adventure and have a growing fan base throughout the badlands.I\u2019m not going to spoil this story or the ending which is definitely worth reading about. The ending does leave open for the continuation of this series, but for now, this is the last book of the series. This book is only 200 pages long so readers will have no trouble getting through this book. There are a few unanswered questions that need to be answered including one very important one regarding David, and Sarah\u2019s parents.However, I still rate this as a fun and interesting book that will take its place in my ever growing zombie book obsession that I need serious help with.**ARC Received from publisher via NetGalley.com** posted 06/19/2011"}, {"userName": "Hannah", "userReviewDate": "Aug 03, 2011", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/3899614-hannah", "userReview": "A further month after the events of Flip This Zombie, Eat Slay Love details life after Dave\u2019s zombie bite and subsequent cure. It worked. Dave is still in one piece, he\u2019s just a little.. different. And people are starting to notice. In particular, one stalkerazzi reporter, Nicole, who they meet. She ends up being a little more useful than expected on their way to the Midwest Wall to share the cure with somebody who could do some good with it and of course, finally, safety.Now that I\u2019ve read the series up to date, I can happily say that the best thing about these books for me is how quick and easy to read they are. I read all three in about a week and I\u2019m a pretty slow reader. They\u2019re just fun little reads and it\u2019s so easy to pick them up for half an hour inbetween other things, and because of that they have a great re-readability. And it\u2019s very easy to immerse yourself while reading these, which isn\u2019t as bad as it might sound considering it\u2019s set during a zombie apocalypse because that\u2019s generally what you look for in a good read, though I say that and a few days after I\u2019d finished reading them I had a zombie dream. That was pretty scary, because unlike Sarah and Dave, I don\u2019t kick ass!Despite the same fantastically placed obstacles that we saw in the previous two novels, I didn\u2019t feel like this story was quite fast paced enough for me, though it was a little better than Flip This Zombie in my honest opinion. There were new characters and tight, barely-escaped from situations, but it didn\u2019t feel like the story was really moving along very much for most of the book. And I despise the McCray character. Not because of who he is (a drug-addled rockstar), but because I really don\u2019t enjoy the American depiction of typical Brits. There was actually a part where he picked up a baseball bat and called it a cricket bat. Those two things are nothing alike! Cricket bats have a flat-ish surface, if he was going to confuse it with anything then perhaps a rounders bat but being a rockstar known in the US, I\u2019d imagine he knows what a baseball bat is. Brits aren\u2019t stupid, and if the idea was that his drug-addled brain couldn\u2019t tell the difference, that wasn\u2019t presented very well.I found the story picked up a lot towards the end, however, and it finally went somewhere. In fact, Eat Slay Love definitely had the most gripping ending of any of the books in the series so far (I\u2019m assuming Jesse is writing more, it was left open for a sequel), leaving you on the edge of your seat.The little notes at the beginnings of chapters in Eat Slay Love read like advice from a self help book for the zombie apocalypse. These don\u2019t quite beat the zombie marital advice from Married With Zombies but are nevertheless just as light-hearted and hinting at events to come in the chapter. It makes me wonder what other kinds of advice Jesse might give us \u2013 perhaps travel advice for the zombie connoisseur?To read Eat Slay Love, you will really need to read Flip This Zombie first just so you know what the heck is going on from the get go. I wouldn\u2019t recommend doing so but you could maybe get away with reading them without Married With Zombies, even so I would still recommend reading all three. Jesse Petersen is clearly a massive geek and for that I will love her eternally."}, {"userName": "Elizabeth", "userReviewDate": "Mar 31, 2012", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/4299179-elizabeth", "userReview": "Sarah and David have been through a lot together: the zombie apocalypse, bionic zombies, mad scientists, backstabbing people, killing their zombie therapist, the list goes on. David was actually bitten by a zombie, but they administered a cure in the nick of time and he seepyms fine. They still have a vial of the cure and hope to take it over the fabled Wall in the east. Things are going along as normal as can be in the zombie apocalypse until David starts behaving strangely. He suddenly has superhuman strength. He needs less sleep and when he does, he breathes really strangely. Sarah doesn't know what to make of it, but definitely doesn't want to alarm him. Then comes new (not always welcome) additions to their group: a \"journalist\" (read stalkerazzi) intent on recording every minute of the apocalypse and an aging, drugged up rock star. Can this rag tag group get the cure over the Wall? Does it even exist and what will they find when they get there?This is the third book in the Living with the Dead series that follows Sarah and David. The first book works out their relationship problems through zombie slayage. The second features their successful zombie killing business (plus some more relationship problems). The third is harder to classify and much less comedic than its predecessors. Eat Slay Love is the best book in the series so far. The complaints that I had about the zombies either having emotion or physical feelings are finally fixed in this book. No zombies running away in fear or flinching at super important moments that save a major character from a big bite. Our characters are in real danger throughout the novel and the intensity doesn't let up. Sarah and David are constantly fighting for their lives through zombies and crazy rednecks bend on making an example out of them for other outsiders. The best thing is that it evolves from silly fluff to more serious, sustainable dystopic plots.Sarah and David are always a joy to read about. Their ability to find humor in just about every situation is fun and even brings this more emotional installment of the series much needed levity. The new characters are much better than the previous books' minor characters. Nicole, the stalkerazzi, was initially very annoying and kind of creepy, but as the story went on, her intelligence and real personality came through. She isn't just a creepy reporter that would do anything to get ahead or get a story, but proves to be a real friend to Sarah and David McCray, the drugged out musician, also proves to be more than just an inconvenient hindrance. I loved these characters and can't wait to see more from them.The only criticism I have is the ending of the book. I had to finish it because I was so engaged in the story, but the ending threw off the momentum a bit. There is a huge reveal near the end and I feel it would have been more effective to stop there and continue the story in the next book. I still very much enjoyed this novel and I will definitely be looking forward to the next book in the series."}, {"userName": "Phillipa", "userReviewDate": "Apr 26, 2018", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/4267176-phillipa", "userReview": "As always, a light, fun zombie novel."}], "description": "Sarah and David have survived the zombie apocalypse.
