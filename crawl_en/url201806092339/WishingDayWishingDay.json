There were a few typos in this copy, but I wasn't really concerned about them since I new it was an advance copy. I was upset by how choppy the book felt. It's in third person, but it almost seams to be following 'stream of consciousness' half of the time. The rest of the time things seem to have an actual order to them. I also felt like there were too many things left unanswered at the end. Questions were asked, but with no yes-or-no answers they still left things pretty much up in the air. I'm sure for someone else this will be a great read, but for me it was just really disappointing. The idea is good.

Even though I realised this story wasn't for me partway though, I kept chugging away as I enjoyed the characters and wanted to know the answer to the mystery around which the tale is centred. I was therefore infuriated when I reached the last page to find there wasn't an ending! The whole book leads towards understanding one plot point, and to be left hanging and without answers was so frustrating. Unfortunately, the book also had other points I did not enjoy. It begins as a children's fantasy story, but doesn't end up so. The fantasy elements are soon covered by annoying romances and sibling fights. The children's book elements disappear under the heavy weight of the parental depression that permeates the story. Reading this felt as though I'd been sold one product and received another; had I known the one question I had wasn't going to be answered, I wouldn't have kept reading. The charm of this book lies in its characters- a unique family with a likeable and relatable protagonist. The author has a great understanding of her characters and brings them to life with rich descriptions and complex interactions. Had she stuck to creating the magic for which the characters so wish, as opposed to retreating to the realities of schoolyard crushes and mental illness, this book would've been great.

What a terrible mistake. I'm so sorry to rip this apart as much as I'm about to, but it was truly awful. I couldn't relate to the characters, any of them, but I thought that perhaps a child with siblings could. Natasha, a girl with the mind of a writer, is curious about nothing, and allows herself to not have any idea why her mother \"disappeared.\" No one talks about it, and she's not sure if she's dead or what, and she's not curious, really. She never asks. She has a lot of freedom to go where she pleases and she's really intelligent (having to pretend to finish her tests second because she's tired of being the one on top, the class pet, etc.) yet she never goes to the library to read up, perhaps, on what happened to her mother (and again, she doesn't ask anyone in her family, either). This is maddening, and I can't believe for a minute that such a person would exist, so how could I love a book with characters like that? The magical realism aspect was annoying rather than magical, especially since there's this magical ability for Natasha to learn about her mom, her first wish. But instead, she shows typical tween characteristics of moodiness and pushing away that which is good for her and pushes away the magic, denying it's existence despite two of her wishes coming true....everything about Natasha's character development contradicts itself. And the ending is absolutely ridiculous--frustrating, implausible (even if you believe in the magical part of it), and then answers none of your questions. This may have been the worst book I've ever finished, and the fact that it's titled up there as \"Wishing Day #1\" does not forgive its ending. Most books in series leave you completely aware that the book ended at a climax and there's no doubt that there's a book 2, OR, the book stands alone and you may be surprised to find a book 2. This just fizzled out in the worst way. However, now that I think about it, Natasha had a hard time finishing her own stories and maybe the author chose to have Natasha not finish this one either? This technique, although worth a moment of praise to the author for a clever move like that, is not worth the overwhelming dissatisfaction the reader experiences. If I had known what book I was reading, (honest mistake if you see the covers of both books), I'd have seen the poor reviews of this one compared to the one I thought I was reading, so sadly, I wasted 6 hours. The good news is, I'm an adult, and hopefully this book touches the lives of children in a way that I won't understand, so as always, my review is a narrative of my experience and not a judgement on the book's worth."}, {"userName": "Allie", "userReviewDate": "Mar 02, 2016", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/42538608-allie", "userReview": "I feel very fortunate to have received an ARC of \"Wishing Day\" by Lauren Myracle, the first book in this series. This is the perfect little novel for a young girl to read, especially one between the ages of 9-12. The story contains magic, sisters, friendships, crushes, and mystery. I found the whole family mystery aspect to be the most fascinating part of this novel- what happened to Natasha's mom? Who is Emily? What happens next? I was surprised by how anxious I was to know how the story progresses, especially from a children's novel. I thought this book was amazing, I just wish it had focused more on the story and the history of the wishing tree because I wanted some more backstory on that. I liked the little quotes that would sometimes take place in between the chapters. If you have a young daughter who enjoys reading, I would get her this book.

Soll sie sich zum Beispiel wirklich w\u00fcnschen, dass ihre Mutter zur\u00fcckkehrt? Und wie sieht es mit ihrem ersten Kuss aus? Mein Leseeindruck:Das Buch richtet sich an junge Leserinnen ab 12 Jahren. Es ist daher kindgerecht leicht und einfach geschrieben, hat aber trotzdem eine gewisse Tiefe \u2013 alleine schon aufgrund des Themas der fehlenden Mutter. Die Autorin hat dieses sensible Thema gut in die \u00fcbrige Handlung eingearbeitet bzw. ihre Geschichte drumherum aufgebaut. Nat\u00fcrlich ist das Fehlen der Mutter immer pr\u00e4sent, aber es geht eben auch um Themen, die wohl alle jungen M\u00e4dchen irgendwann besch\u00e4ftigen \u2013 Verliebtsein, der erste Kuss, Freundschaft. Mir hat es sehr gut gefallen, wie die Autorin diese Thematiken miteinander verkn\u00fcpft und den Zusammenhalt der Schwestern \u2013 trotz ganz nat\u00fcrlicher Meinungsverschiedenheiten \u2013 immer tiefer werden l\u00e4sst. Dabei ist das Buch in einem sehr einfachen und leichten Schreibstil geschrieben, so dass auch junge Leser die Geschichte fl\u00fcssig lesen k\u00f6nnen, denke ich.

It\u2019s a young adult novel that is part of a trilogy. Natasha lives in Willow Hill, where every girl, when they turn 13, gets to make three wishes - The first wish is an impossible wish. The second is a wish she can make come true herself. And the third is the deepest wish of her secret heart. Natasha is a typical 13 year old girl, but she lives in a world with magic and wishes that can come true. There is a good mystery and the characters are fun and likeable. The only thing I don\u2019t like is something that I don\u2019t like in a lot of young adult series these days - they just leave off on a cliffhanger. I mean, I get that it\u2019s fun to leave things open that need to be solved throughout the series, but I like some sense of closure. JK Rowling did this really well in her series - even though we knew there were bigger issues that weren\u2019t resolved, she closed up each book and left us with a satisfying ending. Wishing Day almost seemed like a long introduction to the series - a lot of exposition of the setting and backstory.

Yet, there are two things in the book that I think some parents might think are a little too mature to mention in a book for younger kids: 1) the suggestion that the MC's mom ran off with another man and 2) a 12 year old telling an adult to \"Lay off the vodka\".

The endemic self-doubt and questioning. The coming to grips with reality while retaining a bit of adolescent magical thinking (if wishing could make it so; not referring to the special \"wishing\" of a girl's Wishing Day).I'm not sure whether the fuzziness of the story arc are down to this being an advance copy of the book or whether it is intentional. Myracle is an oft-published author, including of series books, so this may be her style. Regardless, the pacing and plot points were incredibly frustrating. This is non-spoiler so I will be vague about my criticism of foreshadowing, and leave it that some of the parallels are just too obvious. I think even young readers who twig to them will share this frustration.As for character exposition and development, the nicest touch was of a hobby Natasha enjoys that contains a roadblock she copes with. This bundle came across as very authentic and credible. I wish other parts of the book had risen to this level -- and absolutely the best of YA fiction is capable of doing so, so I don't think I'm setting unrealistic expectations.It is tough with an ensemble cast to bring all the personalities into sharp focus, but I thought too many of the characters were left as too vague. We were left with visuals, not deeper illustrations/characterizations. My biggest disappointment, however, was how the author handled the ending. It was everything one dislikes about a cliffhanger-wait-for-the-next-installment ending. No denouement, lots of dangling threads. No real satisfaction that the story accomplished something. I liked the premise of the story and would have been accepting of it as being a trilogy as per the author's plans. However, when you set something up as a multi-volume work, the first installment needs to be a standup double with a steal of third base so there's a buffer for the second batter up. Unfortunately, Wishing Day is a ground-ball single, and I fear that rather than setting things up in case there's the almost-inevitable second-book dropoff, what we're seeing is the prelude to a sacrifice fly and possibly a scoreless inning. I would be glad to be proven wrong by the next two books, because I like the premise of the story."}, {"userName": "Liss", "userReviewDate": "Nov 23, 2017", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/9891519-liss", "userReview": "Wunschtag ist ein Buch, was meiner Empfindung nach sowohl f\u00fcr Kinder als auch f\u00fcr Erwachsene ein sch\u00f6nes atmosph\u00e4rischen Buch ist.

Geburtstag 3 W\u00fcnsche \u00e4u\u00dfern. 3 W\u00fcnsche, mit einem unterschiedlichen Schwerpunkt. Man hat dabei das Gef\u00fchl, dass ganz tief drinnen die Leute in der Stadt oder auch in Nataschas Familie an diesen Tag glauben und diesem Tag Magie innewohnt. Denn es geht sehr geheimnisvoll zu und irgendwie gibt es immer Spuren, die zum Erf\u00fcllen der W\u00fcnsche beitragen.Vor allem die Vogelfrau, die echt unheimlich ist, aber auch sehr viel wei\u00df, bringt die Geschichte voran und bildet einen roten Faden, der sich durch die Geschichte zieht. Immer habe ich gehofft endlich mehr zu erfahren. Ansonsten ist Natascha ein ziemlicher Familienmensch. Doch auch ihre Familie ist aufregend und geheimnisvoll zugleich. Aufregend wegen ihrer zwei Tanten, die sich gerne streiten. Der Vater, der seit dem Verschinden der Mutter in sich selbst verloren ist und die anderen beiden Geschwister, mit denen Natascha mitzuhalten versucht.Oftmals tat mir Natascha ziemlich leid, da sie sehr sch\u00fcchtern ist und oft das Gef\u00fchl hat, das Geschwisterchen zu sein, was nicht heraus sticht. Denn Darya und Molly sind schon ziemliche Pers\u00f6nlichkeiten.
