For me, she has the strongest voice in the epic fantasy genre at the moment. Her plots are expertly crafted and well-drawn out, as I\u2019ve said before, except this one has been a very long time in the making. The ending I\u2019ve been waiting many years for has finally arrived. To call it emotional would be to evoke a drastic understatement. Ever since  Assassin\u2019s Quest I knew it would end this way eventually. \n\u201cThis is our last hunt, old wolf. And as we have always done, we go to it together.\u201d\nAll good things come to an end eventually, and this series has been working towards such an end over the course of sixteen books. Robin Hobb has weaved so many strands of story together here. The set-up is ridiculously immense. She has literally drawn on everything. The Farseer Trilogy, The Liveship Traders, The Tawny Man Trilogy and The Rain Wild Chronicles are all brought together into one epic conclusion. Fitz and The Fool seek aid from the dragons of Kelsingra and speed across the sea on the liveship Paragon with the ultimate goal of revenge.Bee has been taken on the orders of The Four, a group of whites in charge of Clerres. Fitz believes that she is dead. He approaches his destination with nothing but malice in his heart. He wants blood, and he wants lots of it. He doesn\u2019t think he will succeed; he is going into his mission blind and weary, but he intends to kill as many of his enemies as possible before he draws his last breath. The Fool, on the other hand, believes Bee is still alive. He has dreamt of another future, a future he didn\u2019t think was possible. These are uncharted waters for both men. Why didn\u2019t I give it five stars?The final few chapters of this book were everything I expected them to be; they were everything they needed to be, but it took a long time to get there. A few chapters were very similar in content. Bee\u2019s journey was repetitive at times, and a good proportion of the text was given over to some of the less interesting characters from The Liveship Traders. They were not given point of views, thankfully, but I don\u2019t think the narrative needed to concern itself too much with their lives. Sure, give them a mention but don\u2019t get bogged down with their stories again. I don\u2019t wish to give away major spoilers (or any spoilers for that matter) but this is a very strong ending, though the world remains very open for more stories. There are plenty of threads that could be picked up in the future, and I don\u2019t for a moment think that this will be the last time Hobb's readers get to venture into the Six Duchies and the walls of Buckeep castle. This was a strong ending, but I think the book needed to be edited down just a little."}, {"userName": "Petrik", "userReviewDate": "Apr 15, 2018", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/59458347-petrik", "userReview": "Here lies the end of my journey in The Realm of the Elderlings. Robin Hobb, if you\u2019re reading this, thank you for writing this series and for saving your best work for the last installment.Assassin\u2019s Fate marks the conclusion of The Fitz and The Fool trilogy and at the same time, it\u2019s also the final installment within Robin Hobb\u2019s overarching The Realm of the Elderlings series that\u2019s comprised of sixteen books in total. I started my journey into this series on January 15th and somehow, coincidentally it all ends on April 15th; it took me exactly three months to read all sixteen full-length novels + one novella + one anthology (4.1 million words within 11473 pages of the UK paperback edition) and what a journey this has been. It gladdens me to say that Assassin\u2019s Fate ended up becoming my favorite installment out of all Robin Hobb\u2019s works, by far; it was a heartfelt, bittersweet, and a satisfying conclusion for the series that completely left me in awe of Hobb\u2019s capability as a writer. Having finished this book, I can finally understand why people kept on raving about Robin Hobb being the current reigning queen of high fantasy; as it turns out, she also has become the first female author to be included my favorite authors of all-time list.Like all Hobb\u2019s books, this one started off slowly for the first half despite continuing immediately after the cliffhanger in Fool\u2019s Quest. That said, don\u2019t let this let you into thinking that this book will be similar to Hobb\u2019s previous books. There are so many things that happened here and you can only fully appreciate everything if you actually read all Hobb\u2019s books, not only the one that features Fitz as the main character. Assassin\u2019s Fate is amazing because Hobb converged all the previous plot lines and the key characters from all her series into this one, this is especially true for The Liveship Traders. This book is a culmination of twenty-two years of Hobb\u2019s works and it blew all my expectation out of the water.\n\n\u201cTo Fitz and the Fool.My best friends for over twenty years.\u201d \u2013 Robin Hobb\n\nI can\u2019t emphasize highly enough how incredible this last installment is. I won\u2019t lie that it hasn\u2019t been a smooth sailing going through the entirety of this series but the most important thing is that it was worth the struggle. What makes Hobb\u2019s books amazing? Well\u2026 There are plenty of reason and I talked about them like a broken record already but let me repeat the most important thing one last time (insert Fast and Furious meme here): The excellent characterizations. Hobb\u2019s characters\u2014excluding Rainwild Chronicles\u2014are extremely well-written and believe me, the characters will become real in your head and heart. My favorite parts of this series lies definitely in this aspect: the relationships formed between the characters and how the passage of time affect us as a person. Fitz may not be a favorite of mine but his narration about coming of age, friendships and family is just so incredibly compelling and evocative because of Hobb\u2019s prose. Fitz\u2019s relationships with Nighteyes, The Fool, and Bee in particular are definitely one of the best experience I\u2019ve ever had in reading. The first 50% of this book was dominated by Fitz\u2019s traveling to Clerres, this is in a way almost similar to the dreadful Assassin\u2019s Quest travel sections but one simple thing separate this one from that: The Liveship Traders characters. As I said before, everything converged here and because of that, even seeing the characters just talking and interacting with each other brought a joy that only readers can understand. Finally seeing Fitz interact with the Liveship Traders' characters which I loved making the slow part of the book immensely enjoyable to read.Contrary to my belief that Hobb can\u2019t write great action scenes, she clearly proved me wrong here. The last half of this book was an emotional rollercoaster and tension-packed. It was intense, full of twists and turn, and at times heartwarming and beautiful. I truly didn\u2019t expect this capability from Hobb, the final action sequences in this book almost look like something that Sanderson wrote. Hobb properly builds every single thing in Fool\u2019s Assassin towards this final battle, with chapters ending in cliffhangers all the time, the last half was an unstoppable page turner that will relentlessly tug on your emotion.\n\n\u201cNever do what you can\u2019t undo until you\u2019ve considered well what you can\u2019t do once you\u2019ve done it.\u201d\n\nThere isn\u2019t anything left I can talk about without spoiling or giving hints about this book. I pondered about it for a day on how to approach writing this review and this is pretty much all I can say about the book itself. As for the series itself, let me first say that Robin Hobb is clearly a fantastic author. However, most of her books, in my opinion, do have pacing problems and being repetitive, this is especially true in Assassin\u2019s Quest. Not only that, I also think that The Rainwild Chronicles are still unnecessary to read. Sure, you\u2019ll miss some nuance about Silvers, Dragon Blood, and Kelsingra but for me, it wasn\u2019t worth going through the pain and frustration I had reading Rainwild Chronicles only to get to this book. With the exception of Assassin\u2019s Quest and Rainwild Chronicles, Hobb never fails to constantly deliver a great book. It\u2019s really weird that Hobb gave me one of the worst series I\u2019ve ever read (again, The Rainwild Chronicles) and also one of the best series I\u2019ve ever read (this trilogy, The Fitz and the Fool), Other than the one I mentioned, all her books received 4-5 stars rating from me, heck this book actually deserves a 6/5 stars.I know a lot of people want Hobb to write more books in this world, I personally don\u2019t. Let\u2019s be real here, this series is massive already and there are a lot of moments where the story dragged longer than it should; most of all though, it\u2019s because I doubt Hobb can write a better ending for this series than this. This book is a culmination of all Hobb\u2019s work, she has poured every groundwork from her careers into this book, furthering the series beyond this would just be forcing it.Anger, laughter, sadness, heartwarming, these emotional impact I got from this series are something I\u2019ll remember. Robin Hobb\u2019s achievement on completing The Realm of the Elderlings is stupendous and something that readers in the future will always remember. I have lived my life with these characters besides me for a full scope of three months, these characters have become \u2018real\u2019 in my head but it\u2019s over now. It\u2019s time for me to let go and move on to other worlds. That said, this is not a final goodbye. One day when I miss the characters dearly, I know I\u2019ll visit the words on these books again because there are only two words left to describe my feeling of completing this massive series: I\u2019m content.\nThe Realm of the Elderlings overall review:\nAssassin's Apprentice: \n\n4/5 stars\n\nRoyal Assassin: \n\n4/5 stars\n\nAssassin's Quest: \n\n2/5 stars\n\nFarseer Trilogy: \n10/15 stars\nShip of Magic: \n\n4.5/5 stars\n\nThe Mad Ship: \n\n4/5 stars\n\nShip of Destiny: \n\n4.5/5 stars\n\nLiveship Traders: \n13/15 stars\nFool's Errand: \n\n5/5 stars\n\nThe Golden Fool: \n\n4/5 stars\n\nFool's Fate: \n\n4/5 stars\n\nTawny Man trilogy: \n13/15 stars\nDragon Keeper: \n\n3.5/5 stars\n\nDragon Haven: \n\n1/5 stars\n\nCity of Dragons: \n\n3/5 stars\n\nBlood of Dragons: \n\n2/5 stars\n\nRainwild Chronicles quartet: \n9.5/20 stars\nFool's Assassin: \n\n5/5 stars\n\nFool's Quest: \n\n4.5/5 stars\n\nAssassin's Fate: \n5/5 stars\nThe Fitz and The Fool: \n14.5/15 stars\nThe Realm of the Elderlings: \n60/80 stars\nPicture: My full collection of The Realm of the ElderlingsYou can find this and the rest of my Adult Epic/High Fantasy & Sci-Fi reviews at BookNest"}, {"userName": "Niki Hawkes - The Obsessive Bookseller", "userReviewDate": "May 28, 2015", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/13396599-niki-hawkes---the-obsessive-bookseller", "userReview": "What can I say about the conclusion to the series that has dazzled me for years (becoming my all-time favorite) other than: wow.Assassin\u2019s Fate was beautiful, terrible, and profound. I savored each page, painfully aware it might be the last time I experience this world. I\u2019ve never been as emotionally invested in a story as I was with Hobb\u2019s work, her writing draws you in so completely that you forget yourself for a while, totally at the mercy of her story. Each of her series evoked real emotion \u2013 a sense of love and loss that is almost unparalleled by anything else I\u2019ve ever read. Assassin\u2019s Fate was the most gut-wrenching to date, but it was worth every painful, poignant moment. I\u2019ll be reeling from this one for years to come.I love this series for so many things: its rich histories and epic world building, its endearingly human characters (flaws and all), its immersive writing, but one of my favorite things about it is the subtle weaving of dragons into the story. It\u2019s quite brilliantly done \u2013 dragons always seem to be the center of the overall arc of each series, but are often kept on the periphery of the events within each book (with the exception of the Rain Wilds Chronicles). The further you read, the more you start to realize their significant impact on the world and characters. As someone who loves dragons almost obsessively, I ate up every word. Hobb\u2019s representation of them is truly breathtaking. Oddly though, I wouldn\u2019t call these series dragon-centric because, while essential to the plot, they are usually not the focal point.At the conclusion of Fool\u2019s Fate, (the final book in the Tawny Man Trilogy, a reading experience I\u2019ll never forget), I\u2019d been under the impression Fitz\u2019s tale was at an end. Therefore, when The Fitz and the Fool Trilogy was announced in August 2014, it felt like Christmas had come early. And it was even better than I dared hope! With the introduction of a new POV character, Bee, whom I love just as fiercely as Fitz, this trilogy offered a convergence of every Elderling series before it (Fitz + Liveship + Rain Wilds = Amazing!). It was an unexpected surprise, and I can\u2019t even begin to describe how elated I was. If you haven\u2019t yet experienced the brilliant world of the Elderlings, I suggest reading in the following order (to avoid spoilers):Farseer TrilogyLiveship TrilogyTawny Man TrilogyRain Wilds ChroniclesFitz and the FoolEach series brings with it loads of new discoveries, and I cherished every detail. Learning the histories of this world is also one of my favorite elements to the series. Each new detail felt like a revelation, and it got to a point where I was hanging on every word, hoping to find out more. Who knew it would go so far beyond the somewhat narrow framework of a little orphan boy at Buckkeep castle in Assassin\u2019s Apprentice?All the books Hobb has written in this world are amazing. Each story is a slow burn that takes its time, building momentum as it goes. By the time you reach the end, you\u2019re hurtling so fast you wish you could slow it down to savor every moment. Assassin\u2019s Fate and every book that came before it are officially The Obsessive Bookseller\u2019s top recommends. I loved every beautiful, gut-wrenching moment and will keep these characters close to my heart forever.*Thank you Random House Publishing Group \u2013 Ballantine, NetGalley, and Robin Hobb for the chance to read and review an early copy of Assassin\u2019s Fate\u2013 you made my year! :DVia The Obsessive Bookseller at www.nikihawkes.comOther books you might like:Dragon Weather - Lawrence Watt-EvansThe Thief's Gamble - Juliet E.

I'm still processing my thoughts and feelings in regards to this book, and will have a more complete and articulate review closer to its release day.

There have been tears. What a wonderful gift this series has been and what a wonderful final episode.All strands were connected and interwoven in such an amazing way. Did Robin know how she wanted the story to end up all those years ago when she wrote the Assassin's Apprentice? It boggles my mind. I also found it slightly strange as well as delightful to see the worlds of the Elderlings and Kelsingra combine with Fitz's. Have you ever seen Bedknobs and Broomsticks? Well it was a bit like that when the real cinematic world combined with the animation!I noted so many memorable scenes while reading that I thought to cite in this review, but I'm not going to spoil your fun. I have (almost) never minded the long and winding way in which Robin tells her stories. Every word, you realise afterwards, had its place and its reason. But in this book I found the story zoomed right along from page 1. No more hints and subtle foreshadowing: all that's been done already in the previous books. THIS is the big reveal, where everything comes together.The ending was fitting and perfect.Please don't read this unless you've read the preceding volumes of this work. I'm sure Robin wouldn't thank me for saying this with so much of her writing career still to come, but to me this is her Magnum Opus.Thanks to Netgalley, Robin Hobb and Random House Publishing group for this ARC.

Esta saga tiene 20. No puedo decir que transit\u00e9 toda mi vida junto a Fitz, Nighteyes y the Fool. No puedo decir que crec\u00ed con ellos y me form\u00e9 desde mis primeros a\u00f1os junto a sus aventuras y desgracias. No tengo esa satisfacci\u00f3n literaria, interna y casi personal. Comenc\u00e9 a leer la saga cuando ten\u00eda 19 a\u00f1os. Cuando el primer libro sal\u00eda \u2014Assassin's Aprendice\u2014 yo contaba con 2 a\u00f1os de vida. Ni siquiera sab\u00eda leer. Los sonidos que sal\u00edan de mi boca eran balbuceos de palabras incoherentes. Fitz en ese momento ya hab\u00eda comenzado su camino. Yo estaba comenzando el m\u00edo.Empec\u00e9 a leer a Fitz como por un impulso. Fue al azar, algo que no estaba destinado a ser, tal como Fitz no estaba destinado a vivir. Un d\u00eda entr\u00e9 a una librer\u00eda cualquiera con un par de billetes en el bolsillo. Solo hab\u00eda entrado para mirar. Ni ten\u00eda pensado comprar nada. Sin embargo, contra todo pron\u00f3stico ese d\u00eda sal\u00ed con una bolsita blanca con el primer libro de la saga dentro. Y ese mismo d\u00eda lo comenc\u00e9. Y ese mismo d\u00eda empez\u00f3 esta aventura compartida que me acompa\u00f1\u00f3 estos \u00faltimos a\u00f1os hasta en momentos que no la estaba leyendo, pensando en sus personajes a altas horas de la madrugada como si fuesen personas del mundo f\u00edsico, tangible.Porque con esta saga aprend\u00ed lo que un autor puede ser capaz de lograr con sus personajes. Cada uno de los personajes que integraron esta serie no fueron representaciones de cart\u00f3n, sin vida y resquebrajadas con el tiempo. Se sintieron, como dije m\u00e1s arriba, personas reales. Y con esto me refiero a que yo ya era capaz de saber c\u00f3mo reaccionaria x personaje ante x hecho, algo logrado enteramente por la complejidad interior de cada uno de ellos, este entrelazamiento transliterario que supera la simple lectura y se deposita como una certeza en la mente del lector. Fitz, the Fool, Nighteyes y dem\u00e1s personajes no eran solo focos de atenci\u00f3n, herramientas para que la historia pudiese fluir como la autora lo quisiera. No. Con el paso de las p\u00e1ginas, los protagonistas fueron abandonando su cualidad de personajes para presentarse ante m\u00ed no como un medio de entretenimiento, sino como mis amigos.Fitz y the Fool quiz\u00e1 no hayan estado conmigo 20 a\u00f1os, como muchos lectores pueden decir; pero estuvieron 3 que se sintieron como 20. Fue una relaci\u00f3n entre lector y personaje intensa, divertida de a ratos, pero mayormente triste. Porque esta saga no cuenta una historia del tipo \u00ab... y vivieron felices por siempre\u00bb. Este es el camino de un h\u00e9roe tr\u00e1gico, inmerso en desgracia, infelicidad e injusticia. Un h\u00e9roe que gana su condici\u00f3n de h\u00e9roe de rodillas. Aqu\u00ed no existe la recompensa disneysiana, aqu\u00ed las segundas oportunidades no existen. Aqu\u00ed se viene a sufrir, a buscarle compa\u00f1\u00eda al sufrimiento propio. Es un abrazo de alguien que entiende. Un asentimiento de cabeza de un compa\u00f1ero silencioso. Tambi\u00e9n cabe resaltar que la historia de Fitz no es una historia para cualquiera. No puedo recomendarla as\u00ed como as\u00ed. Como ya dije, aqu\u00ed no hay recompensa, o, para decirlo de otra manera, Hobb no nos va a dar la felicidad que tanto queremos, el festejo alegre de un final satisfactorio. La historia es agridulce desde el inicio hasta su conclusi\u00f3n. Asimismo, si alguien quiere leer esta saga, tiene que tener antes en mente que esta se despliega de forma lenta, con una gran introducci\u00f3n y una casi carencia de acci\u00f3n. Lo realmente esencial de esta aventura de 16 libros son las relaciones interpersonales de los personajes y el caos interior de Fitz, de este bastardo solitario que tanto he llegado a querer.Assassin's Fate proporciona un buen cierre de todos los hilos narrativos de cada una de las subsagas que la conforman (la de Fitz, Liveship Traders y Rain Wild Chronicles). Todo converge. Todo encuentra su final. Viejos personajes reaparecen y se encuentran con personajes de historias pasadas. Es una maravilla c\u00f3mo Hobb ha sabido construir ladrillo a ladrillo una historia tan compleja sobre una base simple y sencilla. La primera mitad, como es habitual en sus libros, es lenta y elaborada, sin mucha acci\u00f3n. Las relaciones de los personajes se presentan tan complejas como siempre y el hilo argumental se va formando con firmeza, preparando el terreno para lo que estaba a\u00fan por llegar. Una vez pasada la primera mitad, todo comienza a caer. La acci\u00f3n dice presente y las sorpresas abundan. Asimismo, la prosa de la autora acompa\u00f1a a la perfecci\u00f3n el car\u00e1cter del libro, lento, minuciosamente detallado y de un gran uso de la autoreflexi\u00f3n. En mi primera lectura, una vez pas\u00e9 la p\u00e1gina 400, me result\u00f3 imposible no seguir hasta terminarloEn cuanto al final en s\u00ed, fue lo m\u00e1s duro con lo que me encontr\u00e9 en mi vida. Yo cre\u00eda, so ingenuo, que nada me podr\u00eda impactar, que todo lo que pudiese pasar me iba a resbalar. Estaba acostumbrado a los finales duros, injustos, de esos que te agarran y no te dejan ir hasta mucho despu\u00e9s de haberlos le\u00eddo. No obstante, eso no import\u00f3 en lo m\u00e1s m\u00ednimo: el golpe fue efectivo. Las \u00faltimas cien paginas fueron una pu\u00f1alada, una burla, un ahorcamiento. Fueron traumatizantes e inolvidables, insuperables. Un asco desgarrador. L\u00e1grimas hechas palabras. La conclusi\u00f3n de esta saga la esperaba y tem\u00eda por igual. S\u00e9 con certeza que esto no la voy a olvidar jam\u00e1s. Ya pasaron casi dos meses de mi primera lectura y a\u00fan no me la puedo sacar de la cabeza, como una c\u00e1scara podrida pegada al zapato. D\u00eda tras d\u00eda tengo esta suerte de necesidad patol\u00f3gica de volver a agarrar el libro y releerla una y otra vez para hacerla menos dolorosa por repetici\u00f3n.A\u00fan no lo logro. Preparen los pa\u00f1uelos.Y listo. Basta. Me gustar\u00eda decir m\u00e1s. Me gustar\u00eda llenar todo el espacio blanco que tengo disponible de alabanzas y palabras sentimentales. Pero no puedo. Ya est\u00e1. Aqu\u00ed yo tambi\u00e9n termino. No tengo m\u00e1s palabras para decir. Y as\u00ed como les digo gracias a mis amigos, a los personajes de las mil caras, Fitz, Tom, Keppet, Changer, y the Fool, Lord Golden, Amber, Beloved, a vos tambi\u00e9n te digo gracias, Margaret Ogden, Megan Lindholm, Robin Hobb."}, {"userName": "Bob Milne", "userReviewDate": "Feb 28, 2017", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/2224905-bob-milne", "userReview": "Wow. I finished this over the weekend, and I am still struggling to find the right words to convey what a massive emotional impact it had on me. Assassin's Fate is everything I could have asked of Robin Hobb - an entirely satisfying conclusion to not just the story of FitzChivalry Farseer, but that of the entire Realms of the Elderlings and all its interconnected works.This is a book of Farseers, Fools, White Prophets, Liveships, Dragons, are more. It's as if everything that Hobb has ever teased or hinted at before is finally realized here. Not content to merely rip out our hearts, she tears the entire world asunder, ensuring that no corner of the Six Duchies will rise from the ashes of Fitz's final story unchanged. Let there be no mistake, this is a book of endings. Yes, there are new beginnings to be found as well, but Assassin's Fate marks the end of so many characters and storylines that it's easy to miss some of them.I will be honest, it hurt to see Fitz and the Fool at such odds in this series, and that pain only gets deeper here. The closer they get to realizing their thirst for revenge, the more fractured their relationship becomes. He's always known that the Fool lies, holds back, and plays things close to the chest, but it's only here that Fitz feels the true sting of well-meaning deception. What's more, as much as the loss of Bee has already driven a definite wedge between them, the discovery that she may still be alive only serves to splinter that wedge and drive it in deeper. There is a lot of guilt and sorrow here, on both sides, and the way Hobb finally resolves that conflict . . . well, I refuse to spoil it, but I will say it does a beautiful job of bringing the entire story full circle, with a climax that's quietly significant, rather than explosively tragic.In reading this final volume, I find myself gaining a new appreciation for its first installment, a book I was rather hard on at the time. While I still feel Fool's Assassin had some pacing issues, I now understand what Hobb was doing with the characters. It was clear from the start that they had aged, changing drastically in the process, but it's taken three books to understand the how, the why, and the how much. The more we learn about Fitz, the Fool, and Bee . . . the more we understand how their fates intersect . . . the more recognize who they really are . . . the bigger their shared story becomes. I still feel as if Chade was set aside a little too easily, but I loved the way Hobb allowed Queen Kettricken and Thick to slip back into the story, all part of bringing so many things full circle. As for Bee, I resented her in the first book and barely tolerated her in the second, but here she becomes a heroine of note, still hard to like, but easy to admire.Much of this story is a journey, but it's deeper than the waters of the Rain Wilds themselves. There's a dual significance to just about every scene, a story that we read upon the surface, and a story that we feel beneath the waves. I wish I could say more about the Liveships, the Dragons, and their connections to far-off Clerres, but that's something to be discovered in the course of the story. Like I said earlier, hints are exposed and secrets revealed, and done so in such a way that we almost feel as if we should have already guessed at them, yet cannot deny the skill with which Hobb uncovers each one. You don't necessarily need to have read The Liveship Traders Trilogy or The Rain Wilds Chronicles to enjoy this final volume, but you'll certainly miss out on some of the significance.Robin Hobb books take a lot of patience, focus, and thought to appreciate. Her stories are not easy ones, and the emotions they provoke are not always the ones we'd like to take away from an escapist fantasy. Despite the dragons, the prophecies, and the magic of both Skill and Wit, these are human stories, well-grounded in the human experience. As such, Assassin's Fate is the final chapter in a long life, well-lived, a story that many of us have aged with, and while we never want to let go of friends, sometimes it's clear that it's time.Originally reviewed at Beauty in Ruins\nDisclaimer: I received a complimentary ARC of this title from the publisher in exchange for review consideration.

Turning the last page of the previous book my heart hit a wall. How could it end there..... well, it didn't. I produce the UK cover art for Robin's books, and I knew this would be the third in the trilogy, and the cover art would have to be the best I'd done. Robin fed me a short piece of the book when I asked her about the cover and oh it was worse than reading none, because then, of course, I wanted more. And then she sent me the manuscript. When you read to produce the cover art you read in a different way, searching the text for a key, an image. The trouble is that Robin writes so well that I get picked up by the story and carried along, forgetting it's work ( please don't hate me). And this book is everything I ever wanted and more. Things I couldn't imagine. It's like being in a boat in a storm at sea at times. You can't breath, you can't read fast enough. Sketch after sketch I did and it was knocked back by the editor as being a plot spoiler, so I can't show them, and then Robin talked me through the towers. The bee is an obvious motive. I can't say more.I only read the unedited text. I know the book has been edited and honed and polished since then, so it is with great excitement that I await a proof copy of the book. When I get it I will lock all the door, pretend I have gone away on holiday, admit no one, speak to no one, do no work, until I've read the book, this time for the pure pleasure of the story. Because that's what it is. A masterpiece that spins a tale woven around the difference between justice and vengeance."}, {"userName": "Kaitlin", "userReviewDate": "May 14, 2017", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/19126246-kaitlin", "userReview": "Okay...I finished it... I REALLY didn't want to finish it, because I just *hope* it's not the end of everything in the Realm of the Elderlings. This has easily surpassed all the other fantasy series I have ever read for my favourite of all time (I'm including all the Realm of the Elderlings books in that) and as such it's so deeply part of my reading that I don't know if I could objectively review just this book. Hobb's world by this point is completely real to me, and every character feels genuinely like a friend, foe or something in-between...they are REAL to me, and that makes it hard to know what to say about this...possibly the last of the books.Was this book everything I hoped? Yes and No. There's so many things and threads that do come together in this book and a lot of our immediate questions are resolved. However, so many things are once more opened up in this book that I fully believe this world is not over yet and whether Hobb writes more or not, this world lives on past the ending of this book.Fitz. Fitz's story has been a story that got to me in a way no other character's story yet has. I think it's partly due to just how RAW Hobb is on the page. She really gives these character to us, the reader, shows us their hearts, loves, passions and fears. We fall for them time and time again, and then she'll do something horrible to them and we are right there suffering with them. I've never encountered an author who can make me cry in almost every book multiple times, but Hobb can, and does. CONSTANTLY. Even when I felt like I was doing ok and processing things that the characters were going through I would get to the next line and something about the words she had written would just draw out tears and make me pause.This book took me 10 days to read. It's 860ish pages long, and it's the last one (for now). I didn't want it to end, and so I took this slow. Whilst reading this book I went through all sorts of emotions, happy at the love I finally saw for some of the characters, sad at the danger I knew they headed towards...Whilst I was reading this book I dreamed of soaring with Dragons and conversing with Bees and Wolves. I became immersed entirely in Fitz, Bee and the Fool, but also the others who surrounded them.We saw some old favourites return in this book, and so many of the plots we've seen before were rounded off and continued and pushed further than I ever anticipated. SO MANY THINGS HAPPENED.I always tend to read these books with a few friends of mine at the same time and leave messages for them with my thoughts. This time, I couldn't. This one felt too raw. Too personal. Too much.I left a message that was me talking for half an hour once I finished this book. That was all I could do becuase I just didn't want to voice that things were coming to their close whilst I was still reading...The world we saw in book #1 of the Farseer trilogy is SO far from the world we see in book #3 of Fitz and the Fool. We have been through so many wonders and horrors with these characters that they feel like part of our soul by this point of the book, and everything that happens to them we take inside ourselves like the memories of Liveships. This was a journey...Without spoiling things, I loved and hated this all at once. Again I feel conflicted becuase it felt final, and yet there's so much left that we could go to explore. This world is ALIVE for me and just becuase I can't hop on a boat/plane and visit, doesn't mean it's not out there somewhere. I believe Robin Hobb knows it intimately, and we, the reader, are just scratching the surface...but what a story we've already uncovered...If you've never read a Hobb book, I'd start at the start. There's a lot of pages ahead, but every one tells you something raw, and by the end it's beyond beautiful. 5*s of course, and I will forever have a special place in my heart for all these books and for Hobb in general.

I mean, seriously. It only took three doorstopper Fitz trilogies, the Liveship trilogy, the Rainwilds trilogy to make this book shine... but shine it does.

I feel like I've invested so many of my memories and hopes and fears and anger into these books... it's almost as if something of a monumental world-building is shaking off its rocks and leaping off into the distance to hunt itself some prey.I'm frankly amazed that Fitz's story took him through all of the tales of the Elderlings and the Dragons and the Liveships all the way to the Servants, held together with the singular intent to save Bee. It's just ... so immense.Hobb's writing is always pretty much a careful construction and total immersion that builds to a howling wind that then explodes into some of the most memorable scenes in fantasy, but in this trilogy, she ties ALL of these trilogies together and let them ALL explode into something really grand.Wit, Skill, or a synthesis of the two, it doesn't matter.

This series has been one of the most satisfying reading experiences I have ever had, of anything I've ever read, be it literary or genre fiction. Five trilogies, sixteen main volumes, and each book was a joy to read. All of them together was a fine art. What a journey this has been with so many highs and lows. And what an ending this book was. I never anticipated this ending, but thinking back, it couldn't have ended any other way. Every important character, every bit of history and lore and individual adventure came together in this final instalment. It is not only the journey that made this reading experience so amazing but the hypnotic writing, the maddening real characters, the complex relationships and the commentaries on sex and gender. I still don't know if the Fool was a man or a woman but after wondering about it for sixteen books have been led to accept the Fool as just being.

In fact, my sisters are reading this book and warned me not to spoil it, and I told them that up to that point, I couldn't spoil anything even if I tried - NOTHING had happened. It was reminiscent of the last book of the 1st trilogy where it was just tons of travel time and introspection until the last 25% of the book and then BAM, non stop action and emotion.I will say that Bee really grew on me in this last book. I really disliked her in books one and two, but she was great in this book. And little Perseverance - he was so adorable. One of my new favorites. So many people in this series overall that I just loved and were so memorable - Verity, Kettricken, Nighteyes, Chade, Burrich - even Motley! Oddly there were others that I feel I should have liked, but just never really did. Dutiful's wife, Nettle, Fool as Amber, Bee when she was young. Molly most of all - I never liked her. Am I the only one that never really \"felt\" the relationship with her and Fitz?One of the things I didn't like is I felt like the book took too much time with Rainwild and Liveship stuff. I liked those characters, but those sections went on forever and were totally irrelevant to anyone that didn't read the Liveship or Rainwild books. It felt a little indulgent to me that Hobb seemed to want to write a sequel to their story too, but was foisting it on me in a place I didn't want it (in a Fitz book). If I could rate the last 35% of the book - this would be 5 stars. The ending was everything you would want, everything is wrapped up nicely. You'll probably feel like me, absolutely wrung out emotionally, sad to say goodbye to old friends (and let's be honest - their story is done - time to let them go), but satisfied with how things turn out. Despite my nitpicks, this series will always be one of my absolute favorites of all time. The characters are fantastic, Hobb can write so beautifully and emotionally. The magic system is great (skilling, wit, dragons, elderlings), the world is so complete and complex.

I started it over two years ago. I DNF'd Assassins Apprentice twice before trying it one last time. Fate decided I needed to find Fitz and the Fool then. I read the Farseer trilogy over several months. Then I fell into a deep depression. I didn't read for almost a year, not one page. After I healed, this series was waiting for me. I put myself back together, like Fitz had to put himself back together so many times. It's taken me 5 months but I have finished this 16 book series in its entirety. I've never been so passionate, nor so emotional about a book or characters in my life. Fitz and the Fool represent so much more to me than I can put into words. They are two parts of the same being, one isn't complete without the other. The Catalyst and the White Prophet. Their relationship goes beyond explanation. Throughout the books many characters ask them what they mean to each other. They can never seem to explain it well. Boyhood friend, lover, brother. I have used the word soulmate to describe them in the past and I think that is the best word. They love each other deeply, perhaps one of them loves the other in a more romantic sense, but they both love each other. They complete each other and they live for one another. They can't bare to be parted by death, one can't die and let the remain living. It's not right. The ending. Well I knew it would end this way from Assassins Quest. Fitz's goal had always been the same. His road was never going to be easy. The hints are there throughout the Fitz and the Fool trilogies. There is so much foreshadowing for this story. From earlier books and in this one itself. I think it's fair to say that all of the little pieces of information that are at the beginning of each chapter are terribly important. Sometimes you don't want to read them because you want to get straight back into the action. But these little pieces tell you the fates of our heroes many times. If you know how listen. I can't write a review for this book. I can't even begin to make sense of what I feel. All I know is this series is a massive part of me. It will stay with me forever. A memory etched into me like carving stone. This is the first book that made me cry. Normally when I get emotional whilst reading I get tears in my eyes. I have never properly cried. This book made me sob, full on ugly cry. I have never been so emotional from reading a book. This last book was a joy to read and it was painful. Bittersweet. But perfect. Things come full circle, and are finished at last. I'm not going to spoil it but that scene where two (or three depending on how you look at it) become one was beautiful. My heart aches every time I read it again. I'm so happy it ended this way, even if it's not necessarily a happy ending. And for those that are curious. My top three books out of the entire 16 book series are:1) Fool's Quest2) Assassin's Fate3) Assassin's Quest \"Then it was finished. Something finally complete, as it should have been.\""}, {"userName": "Andi", "userReviewDate": "Mar 26, 2017", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/1339848-andi", "userReview": "[For the first time, I felt how some readers felt when it came to Fitz. All he did was whine and cry. I mean, sure he lost his daughter and at one point in the book he thinks his daughter is dead, but I couldn\u2019t believe how many times he was telling everyone he wanted to die and or wanted to end it in a blaze of glory. For someone who has friends and a family that still exists, you sure have a funny way of forgetting that they exist.Bee is an irksome little girl. I know she felt as though she thought her father never loved her and loved The Fool more. That may be true, but I\u2019m sure he most certainly loves her if he\u2019s on his way to Clerres for her. At one point she says something truly hurtful to The Fool \u2026 and after all her chapters of accepting her fate as the \u201cDestroyer\u201d, that ruined her character development for me. I really loved Amber during Liveship, so seeing me take Fitz side regarding her was a bit of a shocker. Then again, The Fool was all over the place like Fitz. He was so dead set on revenge that he just abandoned ship on their way of trying to get into the castle/fortress where the Whites are. What was the point of bringing Fitz with you, Fool? Seems you had everything planned.There are some unanswered questions. The fact that Pillkrop lives and broke off from the destruction of Clerres with a few whites is a bit of puzzlement for the future. He told Fitz and the Fool that the Whites should continue to exist and return to how things were before the Four fucked it all over. However, with the way the world is now\u2026. should they?Where does the Skill River come from? Or, where does the silver come from? And to partner even further off that: where on earth does the Wit come from? These all never got answered and all I found out was that Clerres were stealing unhatched serpents and drawing out their \u2018venom\u2019 to make their magical drug. At least I found out what the Others beach was. Though that beach is still creepy.The Fool said that Dwalia was not Bee\u2019s Catalyst. Who is? Can a white be another white\u2019s Catalyst? Has that ever happened before? It was never really answered. So, the question remains: who is Bee\u2019s Catalyst? Obviously her skin was shedding so it was someone in the story \u2026 I guess, again, if Robin writes a sequel series we will find out. (Edit: This was addressed in one of the comments - I like the fact that she may be her own Catalyst, did not think of that. But I'm waiting for Robin's official word on it.)The Skill Stone is still a mystery to me. How is it that if it was a way of travel from one place to another that people still got lost inside it? Why did they continue to use it if it was unsafe? Hopefully that will be something to dwell upon in another series.When Chade kicked the bucket after diving headfirst into the Skill I said \u2018WELL, THAT HAPPENED\u2019 and then \u2018THANK GOD\u2019. He was so annoying, but in retrospect, he was a very tragic figure. The private letters that Robin included that were sent to Fitz and or what Fitz wrote about in regards to him were enough to understand that he should be pitied. However, the end product was that he was so fucking annoying and he deserved losing his mind.So, to the basics: The reason I give the book three stars is that I believe after getting to Clerres, the story got sped up and very mismatched. Things weren\u2019t answered or explained. As I mentioned before: Skill Stone, where the Wit comes from, motivations of some of the characters, the lack of including some of the characters from other books, and the ending that should have happened but seemed to happen too soon\u2026If there ends up being a sneaky book four out of this, I\u2019ll give it a four-star rating. Again, it was the ending that it was meant to be, but probably not at this moment.

What I can say is much like Ms. Hobb's previous works, this book made me feel. A lot. Audiobook: Elliot Hill is a pretty good narrator. He can be a bit soft spoken however. And he's not great at female voices. I rather wish he didn't try. Still it's more good than bad, and I do think he adds something to the narration that makes the audio worthwhile. If you liked him in the previous books, you should like him here.\nFull Review\nThis book was difficult for me to rate. I don't give out 5 stars easily, and normally when I do it's a no-brainer. This one not so much. The book has some pacing issues, especially early on. I have no idea of the final page count, but in audio it's nearly 40 hours long. Ms. Hobb's books have always been on the slower side, but there were points in this book where it was a bit too much. That's only a minor gripe though.FitzChivarly Farseer is one of the most real character I ever read. When this series was announced I was both excited and nervous to get to spend more time with him. What terrible things would Ms. Hobb do to him this time? She has really put him through the ringer over the years. However my desire to spend time with him again outweighed my fear.When the series started, I was not happy about the addition of Bee's chapters. At its conclusion, I'm still a bit torn on them, but I think the story could not have been told otherwise. I think part of me was just irritated to have to spend any time in the book away from Fitz. In addition to Fitz, it was really great to see some old friends again, some of whom I never expected to see.This book like Fool's Quest before it, rewards those who have read the entire Elderlings series, not just the Fitz books. If you haven't read Liveship Traders and Rainwild Chronicles, I highly recommend you do so first. There is so much that'll you be missing if you don't.There isn't much else I can say without getting into spoilers beyond this: Ms. Hobb has an incredible ability to make feel strong emotions for fictional characters. Joy, anger, love, hate, cheer, sorrow. I feel so much that I'm drained. Few books do that to me, but hers seem to do it all the time, especially the Fitz books. It is for this reason I decided to give this 5 stars instead of 4.Prepare yourself for an emotional journey.

So now I'm finally emerging from what is probably the most debilitating book hangover I have ever experienced, I'll write an actual review. I always try to keep my reviews spoiler free, but with so much riding on the events of this entry that's much more difficult than usual. What that means here is that I have to keep it super vague. Throughout my Hobb reviews, many times I have likened the Realm of the Elderlings to an intricate tapestry in which Hobb slowly and methodically weaves together her ideas and events into a larger picture that isn't immediately apparent. Each part of the tapestry is beautiful in its own right, but the larger picture emerges very slowly. Until now. We learn so much about the world in Assassin's Fate that it's dizzying. Seeds she planted 12+ books ago come to fruition. I feel sorry for anyone who didn't read Liveships or Rain Wilds because they are not the ones who will get the most out of Assassin's Fate. There are new faces and old friends, and things haven't necessarily developed for them in ways you might expect. They will all be hugely impacted by the events of this book. For some, their whole way of life will have to change. Worlds collide for two facets of the Fool with awkward, funny and occasionally terrifying results. It's a masterpiece.About The Ending (stop here if you consider my emotions a spoiler), AKA:It was fitting. As soon as I realized how it would end, I knew it had been inevitable from the very beginning. That didn't prevent me from weeping my way through the last 100 pages, mind you. Granted I'm an emotional reader, but Hobb in particular sure knows how to play my heartstrings like a fiddle. Well enough that my husband took one look at me, said, \"Oh no! Oh honey!\" and immediately brought me both chocolate and a glass of whiskey. He's good like that. If this is the last in the Elderlings novels (and that's a very big \"if\"), it was a magnificent end to a magnificent series. If it's not (and I do hope it's not), I very much look forward to seeing the consequences of the changes that were made to the world in this entry.

You get the picture.Three-quarters through (or thereabouts):Let the tears flow.And finally, you guessed it:Did I jump for joy? Yes, but included in that was a little of every emotion (see above). That's because the ending also put in mind the very beginning of Fitz's tale. I'm talking about the first book, Assassin's Apprentice. Even though I have forgotten much of the in-between during those three long series of stories, the feelings I experienced while reading them are still there. Often while reading this final book, a character would mention a scene from those earlier books, and I would think, \u201cYes, I remember! Loved those parts.\u201d I've said this before, and it still holds true: Fitz has become one of my favorite book characters. After all, I've spent 9 books and 3 series with him. The Fool? Well, I've often held some reservations there, but without him there would be no story. Bee, who is Fitz's child \u2013 and the center of this latest series - is much like Fitz to me. I love her. That's simply stated, but completely honest. And finally, Nighteyes, the wolf who bonded to Fitz, and whom I have missed dearly.

Robin Hobb spent decades carefully sculpting an utterly perfect, captivating, compelling, breathtaking narrative featuring living, breathing characters with rich, consistent inner lives in a relationship that read as more real and important than any I have previously encountered in fiction.So why does the ending ring so false?'Ware spoilers.Let's just get this out of the way: no, I am not butthurt because Fitz and Fool didn't end up banging. Sex and romance were never where I envisioned them ending. I LIKE the representation of true love as platonic between them. I feel romance would have added absolutely nothing to their unspeakably gorgeous relationship.What is bothering me is how stiff, unnatural, and forced their actions are throughout this book, as Robin Hobb abandoned her usual character-driven writing to railroad them to her designated endpoint. This applies to Fitz and Fool's interactions, to Fitz's choices throughout the entire final arc, and even to Bee through much of this last book.What is also bothering me is the lack of a narratively appropriate conclusion to the story and character arcs as previously presented.Regarding the first point, in what world does it make sense to finally, climactically resolve the issue of gender and homophobia between Fitz and the Fool--and then immediately go back to those same old fights? What is Hobb's problem, exactly, with allowing the two of them to fall into uninhibited mutual affection and support? The conflicts feel bizzarre at this point. Unnatural. Forced. The same can be said of the series of choices which leads to a worm-riddled Fitz stumbling into the Elderling quarry. An in-depth review of all the ways Hobb has contradicted her own magic system and lampshaded Fitz making un-Fitz-like choices would be painful, so I'll limit myself to one example:-Fitz and Nighteyes openly acknowledge that Fitz has worms.-Fitz and Nighteyes discuss remedies, and decide between them that a copper coin would be simple and effective. This is an obvious, commonsense approach in Fitz's mind, learned as a child.-Fitz kills his tormentors in the Elderling ruins and loots their bodies. Coins are specifically mentioned.-Fitz then doesn't check for a copper coin, or swallow a copper coin, or ever think about remedies again at all?-?????Hobb's Designated Perfect Ending relies on handing Fitz the Idiot Ball so many times it becomes ludicrous. This is not the character-driven writing that made the Realm of the Elderlings my favorite series for so many years. This is, frankly, weak.And what is this ending that is so important that Hobb sacrificed the charm of her characters and the intoxication of her writing to achieve?It is flat. It is tasteless. It is unsatisfying. It gives not even a nod to the themes of choice and destiny which have been central to the Prophet/Catalyst dynamic. It does not satisfy the narrative promises established by Fitz and Fool's relationship. It produces no emotional catharsis. It demonstrates no character development.The ending is empty.In short, Assassin's Fate is unworthy both of Robin Hobb's demonstrated skill and of the glorius construct which is the preceding series. This book ruins the series.My recommendation to future RotE readers is to stop following Fitz and Fool at the end of Fool's Errand. That is as close as RH came to neatly wrapping up their plotline. That is the closest I have experienced to satisfaction regarding these two fine characters, my favorite in all of literature. I hope that by skipping this last botched arc, your experience will not be as disappointing as mine has been."}, {"userName": "Suzanne", "userReviewDate": "May 25, 2017", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/5096743-suzanne", "userReview": "What a beautiful conclusion to multiple series. This was probably my most anticipated book of 2017, and it did not disappoint. I've loved the world of Fitz, and the Liveship Traders, and the Rainwild Chronicles, and this brought so much together. I would recommend that people read all those series before this one - for one thing, they are all excellent. And for another, it adds so much depth to this series, and especially this book, to have all of that beautiful background.There is not a lot that can be said about this book without spoilers. It was emotionally draining and beautiful :)"}, {"userName": "Paul", "userReviewDate": "Jun 13, 2017", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/9146810-paul", "userReview": "This is going to be an awful review because I've been reading this series for years and 16 books later I have finished my favorite author's series. I love this series. I love these characters. I love that this book was basically a farewell tour of the world and its characters. I think that The Fitz and Fool trilogy itself might be my favorite part of The Realm of the Elderings but I love everything about it. Don't let the hype of the series deter you or make you critical of the first books, stopping you from reading the rest. It is worth it, trust me."}, {"userName": "Lema", "userReviewDate": "Apr 15, 2018", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/18145934-lema", "userReview": "[ALL THE STARS]Haunting, mesmerizing, emotional to no end, fantastically satisfying.\n\u201cThis is our last hunt, old wolf. And as we have always done, we go to it together.\u201d\n*cue ugly sobbing* I have no idea who did this, but whoever you are thank you :')This is everything I wanted from the conclusion of this gigantic, amazing, frustrating series that I've been living for the past several months. This is clearly Robin Hobb's Magnum Opus, her writing, her plotting, the characterizations....ooooh the characterizations. It's been 3 freaking days and I'm still shook!I honestly don't know what to tell you, this is definitely Robin Hobb's fastest paced book, the plot just sort of explodes since page 1, I pretty much read it over one weekend. That's it! inhaled it in 2 days! That's how gripping it is, the sense of horror and trepidation because you know that anything can happen to those beloved characters and that Hobb definitely gives zero fucks for our feelings and is not afraid to do anything to them. Well she obviously does give some fucks for our feelings otherwise this wouldn't have come out as the wonderful masterpiece that it is but you know what I mean..Whenever I try to think of more quotes to highlight in my review I end up almost slapping the entire novel here, I can't recommend highly enough her writing and I can understand now why this series is called the Literary fiction of fantasy. I can thank her now for elevating my standard to sky high levels when it comes to prose.Now we come to the crux of this review and what probably every fantasy fan ask themselves when faced with the question: Should I read Robin Hobb? Are her books worth the hype?Well the short answer is:  YES YOU SHOULD AND YOU BET YO ASSBefore I get to the long answer, I'll just mention quickly this:How to read the series? Start by Farseer Trilogy, the popular opinion is that it's the weakest series, I disagree, it's certainly not Hobb's best work, but I loved it to pieces! then continue on with Liveship Traders then Tawny Man, here you can continue with publication order and continue on with The Rainwild Chronicles, knowing that it's Hobb's weakest work, or you can do like me and jump straight ahead to Fitz and the Fool trilogy, you won't miss much and talking to Petrik (who hated Rainwild Chronicles with a passion :'D) it looks like it's better to do it better my way, as you'll feel more sympathetic towards RWC characters when you meet them for the first time in F&F and now I have RWC to go back to and enjoy because I'm still not ready to leave this world yet.The long answer would be the following:This is a character-driven fantasy, I can count of one hand the amount of actual \"epic battles\" and \"physical confrontations\" typical of this genre. This is also not only a character study but a dissection of society and the eternal discussion of feminism, free will, slavery, racism, gender identity, tolerance, not to mention the ones everyone love to read about such as loyalty, friendship, family and love. That from the point of view of a deeply flawed (with a flare for the dramatic) hero that you can't help but love and root for since Book 1, so imagine how deeply attached you'll be by Book 16 (70-pages-of-continuous-crying attached I kid you not). Not to mention is that the Fool is probably one of the best characters I've read about in fiction, his mystery and ambiguity give him a certain charm that doesn't fade, and peeling out the multitude of layers that his character is famous for never fails to give the reader a deep sense of satisfaction.The character of this book are not just characters to me any longer, they are my friends and they are real to me as they can get. You live their joy and sorrows, their triumph and losses, you feel every bit of pain they feel (PREPARE TO HAVE YOUR HEART RIPPED OUT AND YOUR SOUL TORN TO SHREDS) and you'll enjoy EVERY SECOND of it. Let it be known though that this won't be an easy ready, it'll give you many frustrations and sometimes can be a struggle, but the payoff is so worth it that you'll forgot all the bad and remember only the good glorious.So to answer your: Should I read this? It certainly is a commitment, I would say if by Book 2: Royal Assassin (my favorite of out Farseer Trilogy) you don't feel that you're rooting for these characters, then I wouldn't bother to continue. My favorite out of all the series? Definitely the final trilogy Fitz and the Fool and definitely Assassin's Fate, probably this book will stay with me for a long long time and will always be on my favorite books of all time.Fitz, the Fool and Nighteyes by Sashamalikart on tumblrThe Farseer TrilogyAssassin's Apprentice 4 starsRoyal Assassin 4.5 starsAssassin's Quest 3.75 starsThe Liveship Traders TrilogyShip of Magic 5 starsMad Ship 5 starsShip of Destiny 5 starsThe Tawny Man TrilogyFool's Errand 5 starsGolden Fool 5 starsFool's Fate 4 starsThe Fitz and the Fool TrilogyFool's Assassin 5 starsFool's Quest 4.75 starsAssassin's Fate 5 stars"}], "description": "More than twenty years ago, the first epic fantasy novel featuring FitzChivalry Farseer and his mysterious, often maddening friend the Fool struck like a bolt of brilliant lightning.
