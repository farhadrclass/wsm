It's Allen not Al-laine. & he is enjoying a holiday in Marsh's native New Zealand.Members of the Incorporated Playhouses acting troup offer Alleyne a seat in their train carriage. They are all on their way to the fictitious town of Middleton, near Ohakune in the centre of the North Island..\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nThe Daylight Limited train crossing the Hapuawhenua Viaduct north of Ohakune, ca 1930s(National Library Collection)\n\n\nAlleyn is invited to their latest production & of course there is a murder. Typically for Marsh the murder is staged (Ha! Staged - I kill me!) in a highly unlikely way and (also to me highly unlikely) Alleyn ends up assisting the local police.What I liked was revisiting old fashioned kiwi slang. I'm old enough to remember some of these now dated expressions. We do still say we are \"feeling crook\" if we are unwell, less likely to \"go crook\" if we are angry. & I promise we aren't so sensitive to criticism of \"God's Own Country\" as we used to be.There are also signs of how real Alleyn is becoming to Marsh. His character changes often in the previous books - in the case of A Man Lay Dead often in the same chapter! This book he is more consistent - & with less of the upper class angst that is a tiresome feature in some of her later books. Marsh even has Alleyn as an author;\n\n\nThis reminded me so much of my made up world as a young teen that I gave an affectionate giggle!I also liked the cast of characters and the inventively named chapters. The latter is just fun, but the former helps this reader keep a large cast straight. I wish more modern mystery writers would do this.\n\n\nLastly, I can't resist this quote from this 1937 novel.\n\"What do you think,Mr Alleyn? If there's another war will the young chaps come at it, same as we did, thinking it's great? And get the same jolt?

So far I have really enjoyed some and others, like this one, have left me a little under-whelmed. Roderick Alleyn is on holiday, with the suggestion that he is \u2018recovering,\u2019 from an illness, or injury. However, he is not destined to get much relaxation after falling in with the Carolyn Dacres English Comedy Company, who are on tour in New Zealand. One of the players is Susan Max, a character actress who appeared in an earlier novel, which gives some suggestion as to why he is travelling with them. After arriving by ship, the company are travelling by train to their first stop, when Alfred Meyer, Proprietor and Managing Director of the company, says that someone tried to push him off the train. His wife, and leading lady, Carolyn Dacres, is upset, but as she is having a long time flirtation with leading man, Hailey Hambledon, perhaps she is not as upset as she says. Then, a silly young girl, Valerie Gaynes, who has been taken on by the company as a favour to her rich father, has a lot of money stolen. It is not the best start and then, when the company arrive, their initial on stage success is dampened by murder.All throughout her life, author Ngaio Marsh was heavily involved in the theatre and so this is obviously a world she knows well \u2013 as well as being set in her native New Zealand \u2013 so possibly I anticipated more from this. There are a number of suspects and motives; from love, jealousy, greed and secrets. Alleyn is present at the murder and, when the local detectives discover who he is, he is immediately involved in the investigation. Personally, though, the mystery seemed a fairly unsatisfactory cataloguing of endless motives. Which got somewhat bogged down in loose ends, alibi\u2019s and timings and did not have a particularly satisfying ending. Still, I have really enjoyed some of the series, so look forward to reading on and exploring more of her work."}, {"userName": "Bev", "userReviewDate": "May 07, 2018", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/5082359-bev", "userReview": "Vintage Murder (1937) by Ngaio Marsh finds Inspector Roderick Alleyn on a rest cure holiday in the large island country of New Zealand. He's recovering from some unnamed injury acquired in the line of duty and he's hoping for a trip full of nothing but peace and quiet. However, while traveling cross-country by train he encounters a touring acting company which includes one familiar face (found in the earlier story Enter a Murderer) and he makes friends with others. This results in an invitation to a performance and the company's after-party--which will also honor the leading lady's birthday.He should have known that he was in for a very different sort of drama when said leading lady Carolyn Dacres's husband is nearly shoved off the train and a large sum of money is stolen from another cast member. It definitely doesn't surprise the reader that murder strikes during the birthday party and Alfred Meyer, the husband, is the victim. One might be surprised that the murder weapon is huge jeroboam of champagne that drops unceremoniously upon his head during what is supposed to be a pleasant surprise for the birthday girl.The local police assume it is an accident--a slight miscalculation of the angle of descent. But Alleyn is forced to gently lead them to the clues he's already spotted which point to a more sinister explanation. He then treads a narrow path--trying not to step on official toes--on a busman's holiday to help discover who had the opportunity to tamper with the champagne surprise package as well as a motive to kill the inoffensive company producer. They wind their way through suspect interviews looking for anyone who lacks an alibi for the critical time period and find themselves with several motives, but apparently no one with opportunity. It will take a careful review of the time table and looking at the scene of action from another point of view before Alleyn finally spots the culprit.I really enjoy the Marsh books set in the theater world. As I mentioned in my review of Enter a Murderer, her interest in and love of the acting world really shows in the detail she provides and the treatment of the characters. Favorite bits are the journey on the train and Alleyn's interactions with Dr. Rangi Te Pokiha, a Maori doctor. The plot style is a bit repetitive (from the earlier theater book)--relying again on who was where during the critical period and who had access to the equipment--but still interesting and well-done. The critical draw-back for me was the lack of Inspector Fox--though Alleyn does consult him by telegram and address him in letters. The Alleyn/Fox duo is a partnership I enjoy seeing in action. \u2605\u2605\u2605 and a half stars. [rounded to four here]First posted on my blog My Reader's Block.

For instance, this quote: \"when he spoke, one forgot his age, for his voice was quite beautiful: deep, and exquisitely modulated. He was one of that company of old actors that are only found in the West End of London. They still believe in using their voices as instruments, they speak without affectation, and they are indeed actors.\" The scene is New Zealand, Alleyn is on holiday and at first he's incognito.

They grew more and more wakeful and their ideas seemed to grow sharper. Their thoughts cleared. Alleyn spoke for a long time and the other two listened to him eagerly. Quite suddenly he stopped and shivered. The virtue went out of them. They felt dirty, and dog-tired.

We don't get Olivier's over-the-top emoting, but it needs only that. Some of the lower orders are certainly recognisable! His \"New Zealand\" accent had a tendency to slip over to Sahth Effrica, but nobody's perfect.Classic theatre mystery which starts on a train, giving the golden-age mystery lover a twofer...which is about right for Happy Hour, as the murder weapon is a jeroboam of champers. For the uninitiated colonial, a jeroboam is one of those huge bottles that holds six normal wine bottles' worth, and is often wasted at sporting events by being shaken and sprayed over the winning athletes. If wineries have any sense, they're probably filled with cheap plonk and sold high. After that, it's all who was where when, and could they have been there at all. Added to the murder there's the theft of about a hundred pounds from a silly young miss (the ingenue of the company, natch--in every sense of the word). I have to admit I tried to read this one and couldn't get into it; on audiobook it was bearable, but mostly due to the reader. Ngaio Marsh shows of the glories of New Zealand as seen through the eyes of our Inspector, who is meant to be very open-minded about the Maori character...and yet. There's a little too much reference to his \"savageness\" and how light his colour is, and how all the good Maoris are \"aristocrats\" for my taste. I know it's all very 1930s, and one really can't superimpose Third Millenium attitudes on a period piece which was written in the period, but her superior attitudes get the better of her, even in Alleyn's mind."}, {"userName": "Mary", "userReviewDate": "May 10, 2018", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/2244282-mary", "userReview": "A whodunnit of the old school.

Every character had stone alibi and that made the reading pretty exciting for me.I had a surprise in the end when I found out who was the killer because I thought it wouldn't be so obvious.In this sort of classic crime novels I don't know the reason why I can't write big reviews, but perhaps it's just because I don't want to spoil anything.

Wikipedia informed me that Marsh was born there so I was intrigued to read the only one of her mysteries set there. Vintage Murder was written in 1937 and in many instances shows her unshakable egalitarian nature. One is the inclusion of an urbane doctor who is Maori and studied at Oxford. It also contains the following line, (no spoilers, I hate that) good evidence that bigotry was not universal at that time, \"Mr. Liversidge added that Courtney Broadhead was a white man a phrase that Alleyn had never cared for and of which he was heartily tired\". You go girl.

A Maori doctor and a couple of local policemen have walk-on parts, and there is a very nice account of a picnic trip Commander Dalgliesh takes into the countryside as part of his holiday. Other than that, the characters are all members of an English acting company touring New Zealand. The story might as well be set in Bournemouth. The pleasure in this story is Ngaio Marsh\u2019s description of the actors and their lives as members of a theatrical troupe. She should know; she was an actor and accomplished director herself, and the strains of making a profit in a small repertory company (even then), the tensions between artistic temperaments, and the mechanics of handling props and flats on stage all ring true.Oh, and since I may not be the only idiot who used to pronounce the \u2018g\u2019 in her name, Dame Edith Ngaio Marsh DBE said her name as \u201cNio\u201d to rhyme with \u201cbio\u201d, not as in \u201cngaio tree\u201d."}, {"userName": "Starfish", "userReviewDate": "Dec 28, 2009", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/128770-starfish", "userReview": "I'm not sure whether this is excitement at the discovery of a mystery that has all the elements I enjoy in a Golden Age whodunnit, or gratitude to Marsh for writing about New Zealand in a way, that if self-conscious, is understandably so, and reminds me of an era I never knew, but is engrained in me as much as any part of New Zealand is -- which sounds affected and makes no sense, but there you are. There's just something about reading Ngaio Marsh talk about New Zealand that makes me nostalgic for home. The mystery is beautifully paced and filled out, the characters are charming and her one Maori character is quietly problematic -- really brings the attitudes of the time into uncomfortable focus, making the book fascinating for what it says about how NZers view themselves as much as the mystery itself.

The general setting is New Zealand, though apart from one Maori character and one scene in the mountains, the story could have been set anywhere.I listened to an audio recording of the book, read by James Saxon, who was a British character actor. He provided an intense variety of voices for this book--every character had a different accent or inflection. At times, it felt a bit too over-the-top, too caricaturish. His women, especially, sometimes seemed more like a man in drag out of a Monty Python sketch. But for the actor characters, the bigger than life voices were often perfect.

That gives it some good moments of description: there's one interrogation with a lovely setting, and there are some characters who are very lovingly described. There's a bit about Maori culture, too, but mostly that felt like a set piece tacked on for some exotic interest.I think I can see a development here toward something I'm more interested in reading -- Alleyn, Fox and Agatha Troy, introduced in the next book, might draw me in properly for good.

The characters were English , the setting was English and the story was very much \"English\".Now coming to the plot. It was a typical whodunit, lot better than Ngaio Marsh's earlier works and thats why I rate it as an above average.Ngaio Marsh is also considered as one of the notable authors from the golden age of detective fiction. But she is nowhere near dame Agatha Christie. Her plots are simple, their conclusion and ending simpler. But I really appreciate the characters of Roderick Alleyn and Nigel Bathgate.Overall, if one belongs to fandom of Agatha Christie and had ran out of her works then Ngaio Marsh is the real saviour at the time of some severe \"Christie Cravings\"I have read first five of Ngaio Marsh so far and I agree with the majority that her theatre based plotlines are lot better than others. Thus Vintage murder can be considered her one of the best works so far behind \"Enter the Murderer\""}, {"userName": "Susan", "userReviewDate": "Jul 11, 2017", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/47869902-susan", "userReview": "Alleyn is on vacation in New Zealand, recuperating from an undescribed operation. On a crowded train, he is sharing a car with a touring theater company, and most of the characters are introduced here. There is quite a bit of description of what goes on in setting up in a theater; Marsh directed quite a few plays, often with students and touring companies, so she knows whereof she writes. At an after-show birthday party for the star, Carolyn Dacres, her husband has his head bashed in by a jereboam of champagne in a surprise stunt gone wrong. Alleyn soon suspects murder, rather than accident, and helps the local police in their questioning. Many of the troupe members fall under suspicion, until it seems all the alibis prove out and no one could have done it. Alleyn befriends a local Maori physician, who gives him some information that helps lead him to a solution. The New Zealand countryside is described beautifully, and not in numbing detail. To someone who has read Marsh's autobiography, a lot of it sounds quite familiar. The various characters are well-drawn, sometimes so well that one really doesn't like them at all. The story is a little slow-moving, but following the laborious interviewing and conversations among the people keeps one interested in trying to figure out who is the murderer and even more, how he/she did it."}, {"userName": "Sherry", "userReviewDate": "Oct 26, 2017", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/4958153-sherry", "userReview": "I am reading this old series in sequence, now on #5. The author, a New Zealand native, has taken her Scotland Yard character to NZ on vacation. Not surprisingly, Alleyn finds himself investigating and solving a murder. The character continues to be engaging. NZ is beautiful. It is intriguing to read at a 90 year remove (1937 book) how racial/ethnic differences were treated. People use an expression our hero does NOT like, one I heard in my childhood, referring to an upstanding person as a \"white man.\" One prominent character is a physician who is Maori. Some characters speak condescendingly of Maoris. I won't abuse your ears with specifics. Here again, Alleyn has a more enlightened view, but even he thinks of the Maori influences and cultural history as the savage part of this doctor-character."}], "description": "Death served well-chilledThe leading lady of a theater company touring New Zealand was stunningly beautiful.
