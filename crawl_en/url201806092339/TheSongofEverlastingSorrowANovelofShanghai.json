But what he saw that day was not an object, like an old jazz record, but a person.\nThe closest author comparison I can make to this is that of Proust, but only while ignoring all the elitist claptrap that I myself once partook of in the mistaken belief that it would prove a good shortcut in the realm of literary matters. What I was interested in then was not the efficacies of translation or the technicalities of Modernism, although I tried very hard at these and all the rest of the boxes and labels so adored by my classifying species, but the matter of thought, specifically the type which takes all separation with a grain of salt and treats with fashionable clothing as seriously as it does with the Cultural Revolution. I'm not about to strip Wang Anyi's work and stuff it into the mystical Canon as I have also previously and mistakenly attempted to do with other writing. Frankly, the one thing I'm trying to figure out in this review is why, exactly, this work filled with smackings of Gatsby-type soap opera appealed to me so much, to the point of eyeing its various visual adaptations with increasing fervor.\nHasn't it been said that comedy is created by tearing down trivialities? Trivialities were certainly being ripped up in this city, although if truth be told, a good deal of flesh and bone were also involved.\nThe problem with those various visual adaptations, however, is the succumbing to impetus the text never involves itself with. Love, war, age, gender roles, modernization, architecture, life imitating art imitating life, memory, cityscape, violence, ideology, yes, yes, yes, but the existence of a woman as the main character does not automatically entail a character-driven entirety. If you know your history in the Shanghai part of the world, you'll understand the backdrop that introduces and draws back the men and women to and from the figure of Wang Qiao, but this novel will never give you your political thriller and/or critique no matter how far you chase. To put it succinctly, this is a work of the Mary Ann Evans sort of philosophy, far more glamour and glitz in its aesthetic and the gendered 'fallen' in its social analysis but, for all that, quotidian. I would think the only reason why I didn't find that last word associated with the mundane is my outsider status, perfectly encompassed by a persisting lack of passport, and yet the word on the grapevine is 'modern classic' and 'best Chinese fiction of the 20th century'. Mandarin and the rest of the Chinese dialects are beyond my ken, but this does make me happy.\nHere only one sound had an identity. The lord of all sounds\u2014and that was the sound of the bell tower ringing. It overrides all the other sounds and voices, which form a bed of echoes reverberating through the night. The echoes are the finest strokes of a huge painting that constitutes the deep thought of the night. This sound has a buoyancy that lifts you up and knocks you around as if you were riding on a bed of waves. When people have floating on the waves long enough, they feel hollow inside and out, thoroughly saturated by the night.\nIn a word, this work is slow, slow, slow. It takes twenty-six pages to introduce Wang Qiao, a name which only surfaces after cities, paintings, brushstrokes and back alleys, parables and pigeons have each had their turn in the build up to this character, whose embodiment of a specific locality of time is as much a doom as the titular reference to a 9th century work of Chinese poetry. For a brain like mine, one which works in holisms and is quickly fatigued by the successive and sensationalist climaxes espoused by both contemporary memes and espoused classics, this book was an utter pleasure, further enhanced by my unawareness that I even enjoyed this breed of aesthetic engagement. A good litmus test for your own purposes is, does the thought of treating with cities and their denizens as springboards for both plot and philosophy appeal? Or, have you seen the film In The Mood For Love and been haunted forever more? If so, you've found your way to the right place.The curse of translation is, as always, this edition's afterword's rhapsodizing about Wang Anyi's prolific bibliography may never be fulfilled in the English sense within my lifetime. In this at least, for once, youth is on my side.\nYet these are precisely the kinds of wooden and brick boxes within which we live our lives, playing out the good days and the bad.Let us put the wall back in place; otherwise we will hear cries of mourning, mourning the loss of those vanished days."}, {"userName": "Inderjit Sanghera", "userReviewDate": "Apr 04, 2018", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/900800-inderjit-sanghera", "userReview": "Sunlight and moonlight dominate the Shanghai in which \u2018The Song of Everlasting Sorrow\u2019 is set. Dappled sunlight, decorous beneath the dazzling Shanghai mornings, the dull, drudgery of pale, putrid the alleyways between the longtang apartments, the gentle fall of sunlight on a quiet afternoon, the evanescent moonlight, briefly illuminating the beauty of a woman whose life has been worn out beneath the weight of innumerable sorrows; moon-light and sun-light set the stage for the life of Wang Qiyao, whose flame flickers out, slowly and indecorously, whose dreams fall apart one by one, whose wounds, often self-inflicted, serve to sever her from the brief happiness and hope she feels as an adolescent.It is worth mentioning the poetic style of Wang Anyi. Reminiscent of the old Chinese masters, she is able to render the environment with a life of it\u2019s own. The Shanghai she creates is, along with Wang Qiyao the central character of the novel, its moods and beauty, its superficial loveliness and insurmountable depths of gloom are reminiscent of Wang herself;\u201cOne strand at a time, the first rays of the morning sun shine through just as, one by one, the city lights go out. Everything begins from a cover of light fog, through which a horizontal ray of light crafts an outline as if being drawn by a fine brush.\u201dRarely heavy-handed, Wang Anyi delicately traces the finery and finesse of Shanghai, the magic of it\u2019s street and heady atmosphere, gaudy with gossip and home to vast crowds of people, home to a million lives and stories. The principal story we follow is that of beautiful Wang Qiyao. Wan Qiyao\u2019s star rises, briefly, as she is crowned \u2018Miss Third Place\u2019 in a beauty contest, however it flickers fulminously beneath the irrepressible light of the movie camera where he mediocrity is exposed. Although Wang\u2019s life is tragic, this is mostly self-inflicted; she constantly rejects the love and friendship people offer her; discarding friends when it suits her, or disregarding the love of men, such as Mr Cheng, who truly love and care for her in favour of the superficial desire of Director Li; her life becomes a series of might have beens and could have beens, of unfulfilled potential, a life doomed to fade out beneath the half-light of a Shanghai afternoon.There is a rich side cast of characters in the novel, from the reticent and sensitive Jiang Lii, whose love of literature is transformed into a fervour for Communism, to the lachrymose Mr Cheng, whose calm poise is shattered by his love for-and rejection by Wang Qiyao, or Wang Qiyao\u2019s daughter the superficial and glib WeiWei. All of the characters have their own foibles and flaws and Wang is able to draw the rich tapestry of Chinese society. In a time of revolution and upheaval for Wang what was more important was capturing the lives of Chinese citizens, a change in women\u2019s fashion counted more for Chang because such changes had a personal impact, because these kind of changes, although superficial, documented the ordinary lives of Chinese citizens in a way that a simple historical analysis doesn\u2019t. In a way the story of Wang Qiyao, who foresees her own murder as an adolescent and whose last sight on earth is slow, sonorous swing of a lamp is as important as any political documentation of pre and post-revolution China because it captures the personal lives of people caught up in the political upheaval, lives which were doomed to be forgotten, to be lost within the vestiges of time;\u201cThe boats and carts along the interminable waterways crawl on for all eternity. Time is a wall forged of metal that no one will break through. No one can withstand time, The earth endures season after season of planting and harvesting. Waterfowl sing the same tune for hundreds of years. And in a scale of time where the units are counted in centuries, people are as ephemeral as fireflies.\u201d"}, {"userName": "Stephen Durrant", "userReviewDate": "Dec 12, 2010", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/1457001-stephen-durrant", "userReview": "I have been looking for a modern Chinese novel that was not constructed around the political horrors China has passed through during the past one hundred years. Wang Anyi's beautifully textured novel fits the bill. One cannot quite say that it is apolitical, for the political context is always the white noise humming just outside the Shanghai apartments, restaurants, and shops where Wang Qiyao, whose life this novel traces, and her array of lovers, friends, and family mix and mingle over a period of fifty years. The dominant character in this novel, however, is not Wang Qiyao but Shanghai itself. Wang Anyi has a way of turning the alleys, traditional homes, even the air and the pigeons flying overhead into parts of a vast living organism that is Shanghai, one of the world's most intriguing cities. The book is also about nostalgia in both its constructive and destructive forms. The romance of old Shanghai, a world of class, taste, and style . . . but also a world of sexual exploitation . . . yields to the vulgarity and coarseness of a new and more democratic world. Still, islands of memory remain--Wang Qiyao is one--and those islands become a refuge for younger people who want to glimpse the glory of an age that has past. Wang Anyi's novel is not a page-turner but it is a brilliantly nuanced and highly emotional story of one woman who spans the old Shanghai and the new and who is both a terrible victim of the past and someone whose power over others derives in large measure from the values of that earlier era that she personifies so well."}, {"userName": "Alicia", "userReviewDate": "Nov 25, 2008", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/255516-alicia", "userReview": "The Song of Everlasting Sorrow: A Novel of Shanghai by Wang Anyi opens with exquisite descriptions of Shanghai and its distinct and mysterious longtang - neighborhoods that are as much a character as Wang Qiyao, a former beauty queen whose life has gone sadly awry. Wang Oiyao, comes together with people, only to drive them away in the end, unaware of her impact on others as her country is on its people"}, {"userName": "Sookie", "userReviewDate": "Sep 10, 2017", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/4136921-sookie", "userReview": "By the time Wang Anyi introduces her protagonist Wang Qiyao, she shares an intimate tour of the city, Shanghai. Wang Anyi takes time to tell her readers the long intricate alleys, the way gossip travels through crevices of shared walls, the beautiful view of the city through the eyes of its pigeons and the changing times when girls dream of beauty pageants and PhDs. The protagonist and Shanghai are coming to terms with China's newfound modernity and the influence of the west on the country, on the city and its people. The politics of the time hovers throughout the story as a ghost; unseen but its presence felt in the sidelines. Wang Qiayo is representative of the women who want independent lifestyle defined on their own terms. The men she invites into her life are all shaped by the idea of Shanghai - in the way the essence of the city sticks to the skins of everyone encompassing it, its diverse population in terms of nationality and ethnicity. These men chip away a part of Wang Qiyao and she drudges through life as cultural changes and political rallies heat up the world around her. Like the city, Wang Qiyao moves to motherhood with grace and nonchalance. The idea of a child, a daughter encourages her to reflect on her own life, her choices and the sorrows it brought. She is kind to herself when she remembers some of the good times and handful or relationships that still remain. Her life ends in the way all her choices end - in tragedy. The city chose her, shined its lights on her as sprung into Shanghai society scene with a picture of her printed in a magazine, and took the spotlight in the hands of a scam artist. Wang Anyi's poetic prose is best when she writes Shanghai as a strong character. She withholds Wang Qiyao's thought process when the protagonist makes decisions that irrevocably affects her life. Its well understood that Wang Qiyao wants the life of glamor and loves the society life that the city offers but the readers aren't made privy to motivation behind some of her actions. The writing is appealing but the narration gets in the way of plot. The abruptness of ending works to the advantage of the plot but the time taken to get there, is heavy handed with exhausting drama.The title - The Song of everlasting sorrow is a disclaimer, a promise, a spoiler alert, an eventuality that the reader knows is coming when Wang Qiyao is first introduced. Just how a tabloid garners one's attention towards it, Wang Qiyao stays on the page; never really leaving and inching closer along the edges."}, {"userName": "Andrew", "userReviewDate": "Mar 13, 2018", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/442654-andrew", "userReview": "Think a Chinese Zola -- an epic novel of social change revolving around the life of a single woman, from her youth in the glittering heyday of Paris-of-the-East Shanghai, to the tumult of the Deng Xiaoping era. This alone should be a ringing enough endorsement.Wang Anyi's relationship to the upheavals of 20th Century China is also fascinating, and often in a rather perverse way. While the great realists of the 19th Century whom Wang takes her cue from -- Zola, Balzac, Tolstoy -- were all able to toss full-fledged political bombs, you can sense the invisible bonds of self-censorship. The 1948 Revolution is almost an afterthought, and the Cultural Revolution is addressed more like a sidenote (\"and then times were tough and shit\"). It's only when Deng enters the scene that Wang Anyi actually comes out guns blazing, and her narration doesn't really pass judgment on the developments of the 1980s, it just comments. Frankly, she's a bit of a genius at evasion of the issue -- somehow (and I'm not sure if this is what she was going for) all that self-censorship makes me notice the elephant in the room even more."}, {"userName": "Kimfu", "userReviewDate": "Aug 31, 2013", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/5515746-kimfu", "userReview": "Once more I've read a Chinese novel that I just couldn't get into. I SHOULD have been able to get into this novel because it talked about the struggles of a woman protagonist. But I just couldn't understand the character. I couldn't feel much empathy for her either. All of the time, I kept thinking, \"Just what is going through her mind? Why did she do that? Why did she say that?\" She seemed every bit as much a stranger to me at the end of the book as at the beginning.And the end of the book ended in her murder, so that's ANOTHER reason I should have liked this book because murder novels are one of my favorite genres. But I didn't really find the murder all that exciting. Although, interestingly enough, I could better understand the motives of the murderer than those of the female protagonist.What I DID find interesting about this book -- and I've never seen this in any other book covering many years of modern Chinese history -- is that all of the historical episodes that were occurring at the exact same time as the story, were kept in the background. It was as if the history of China weren't as important as the history of the female protagonist -- and I guess that's exactly what the author wanted to portray.This book won lots of awards, so I was able to read a lot of commentary about it. I actually enjoyed the commentary better than the novel itself. And it became clear to me that many people DID like the novel and appreciated the writing style of the author. What a pity that I wasn't one of those people!I give \"The Song of Everlasting Sorrow\" a 5.5 on a scale of 10.\"The Song of Everlasting Sorrow\" is Book No. 21 for 2014!(\u4e8c\u5341\u4e8c)"}, {"userName": "Graeme", "userReviewDate": "Sep 27, 2015", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/3190043-graeme", "userReview": "It's not, unfortunately, as good as its reputation would lead one to believe. The style can occasionally become wearisome, in particular in those purple passages where the author seems to be trying too hard to impress; I had always been brought up to believe that excessive use of \u6210\u8bed, especially run together one after another, is a sign of weak writing, rather than of cleverness. This is no presumably not the fault of the author, but, like other writers publishing in China today, Wang conveys the rather misleading view that things were pretty well okay in 1950s China, and into the 1960s (with a gentle nod to the famine years) until things went sour during the Cultural Revolution. That said, the novel has some real strengths. Some of the characters are well drawn and believable, and the way the denouement draws a line under a life while echoing an event from early in the story is neatly done."}, {"userName": "Mizuki", "userReviewDate": "Jan 27, 2015", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/16842102-mizuki", "userReview": "Some years ago there's a movie based on this novel, but I never am interested enough to watch it, and I don't think I'll be interested enough to read the book any time soon."}, {"userName": "Charles Laughlin", "userReviewDate": "Nov 29, 2011", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/6296544-charles-laughlin", "userReview": "Splendid translation of a fine novel, way to go Michael Berry and Susan Chan Egan!"}, {"userName": "Sharlene", "userReviewDate": "Jan 07, 2013", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/388772-sharlene", "userReview": "\u201cThe longtang are the backdrop of this city. Streets and buildings emerge around them in a series of dots and lines, like the subtle brushstrokes that bring life to the empty expanses of white paper in a traditional Chinese landscape painting. As day turns into night and the city lights up, these dots and lines begin to glimmer. However, underneath the glitter lies an immense blanket of darkness \u2013 these are the longtang of Shanghai.\u201dWang\u2019s writing style takes a while to get into. The Song of Everlasting Sorrow (\u957f\u6068\u6b4c) opens with details of the longtang or neighbourhoods within enclosed alleys of Shanghai. It\u2019s a beginning that requires some patience from the reader. Because plenty of beauty awaits within.\u201cFour decades the story spans, and it all began the day she went to the film studio.\u201dWang Qiyao is taken to a film studio by her classmate Wu Peizhen. There a director notices her and asks her to a screen test. However he realizes that:\u201cWang Qiyao\u2019s was not an artistic beauty, but quite ordinary. It was the kind of beauty to be admired by close friends and relatives in her own living room, like the shifting moods of everyday life; a restrained beauty, it was not the kind that made waves. It was real, not dramatic\u201d.To make up for it, he asks his friend Mr Cheng, a photographer, to take some pictures of her and one of them is published in a newspaper and Shanghai begins to notice her:\u201cThe girl in the picture was not beautiful, but she was pretty. Beauty is something that inspires awe; it implies rejection and has the power to hurt. Prettiness, on the other hand, is a warm, sincere quality, and even hints at a kind of intimate understanding.\u201dShe is convinced by the photographer Mr Cheng and her classmate Jiang LiLi to join the Miss Shanghai contest, where she becomes known as \u2018Miss Third Place\u2019:\u201cGirls like Miss Third place, however, are a part of everyday scenes. They are familiar to our eyes, and their cheongsams never fail to warm out hearts. Miss Third Place therefore best expresses the will of the people. The beauty queen and the first runner-up are both idols, representing our ideals and beliefs. But Miss Third Place is connected to our everyday lives: she is a figure that reminds us of concepts like marriage, life, and family.\u201dThis is just the beginning of Wang Qiyao\u2019s story. She gains the attention of a high-powered man, who essentially makes her his \u2018apartment lady\u2019 or mistress. After his accidental death, she is forced to restart her life in a different longtang, taking on the identity of a widow, making ends meet by giving injections (yes, this puzzles me too, apparently people come to her for various injections such as vitamins and \u201cplacenta fluid\u201d). She makes new friends, starts to have a clandestine relationship with one of her mahjong partners (he is from a wealthy family) and finds herself with child.While Wang takes us through the years of Wang Qiyao\u2019s life, an aura of mystery still wafts around her. She is quite the enigma.\u201cShe is the heart of hearts, always holding fast and never letting anything out.\u201dShe is that woman at the party who sits quietly in the corner sipping tea. Not the life of the party (she is after all, much older than the rest of the partygoers) yet the eye is drawn to her:\u201cShe was an ornament, a painting on the wall to adorn the living room. The painting was done in somber hues, with a dark yellow base; it had true distinction, and even though the colours were faded, its value had appreciated. Everything else was simply transient flashes of light and shadow.\u201dThis is not just Wang Qiyao\u2019s story but the story of Shanghai, as we move from the 1940s to the 1980s.\u201cShanghai in late 1945 was a city of wealth, colours, and stunning women\u2026 Shanghai was still a city of capable of creating honor and glory; it was not rules by any doctrine, and one could let the imagination run wild. The only fear was that the splendor and sumptuousness of the city were still not enough.\u201dIn 1960 though, times have changed drastically.\u201cIn the still of the night the city\u2019s inhabitants were kept awake not by anxious thoughts but by the rumblings of their stomachs. In the presence of hunger, even the profoundest sadness had to take second place, everything else simply disappeared. The mind, stripped of hypocrisy and pretensions, concentrated on substance. All the rouge and powder has been washed away, exposing the plain features underneath.\u201dThen in the 1980s, Shanghai is booming. Construction sites abound in this new districts\u2019 \u201cforest of buildings\u201d:\u201cThis was indeed a brand-new district that greeted everything with an open heart, quite unlike the downtown area, whose convoluted feelings are more difficult to grasp. Arriving in the new district, one has the feeling that one has left the city behind. The style of the streets and buildings \u2013 built at right angles in a logical manner \u2013 is so unlike downtown, which seems to have been laid out by squeezing the emotions out from the heart.\u201dThe Song of Everlasting Sorrow was such a different read for me. It moves at a very gentle pace and is probably best described as a portrait of Wang Qiyao\u2019s life. Yet I was drawn to her melancholic story, to Wang Anyi\u2019s intricate depiction of Shanghai through these volatile years. It\u2019s an enduring, elegant novel, and one of my favourite reads so far this year.Originally posted on my blog Olduvai Reads"}, {"userName": "Susana", "userReviewDate": "Jul 11, 2017", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/53314227-susana", "userReview": "Odio la nostalgia, pero agradezco encontrar una novela que repase la historia contempor\u00e1nea de China desde una experiencia femenina, gastron\u00f3mica, textil, arquitect\u00f3nica, sensorial... y menos desde la genial pero ya manida parodia pol\u00edtica de un Mo Yan o un Yu Hua."}, {"userName": "Wenna Chen", "userReviewDate": "Aug 12, 2017", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/70288478-wenna-chen", "userReview": "\u4e0a\u6d77\u5c0f\u59d0\u738b\u7426\u7464\u7684\u4e00\u751f\uff0c\u66f8\u88e1\u6709\u5927\u91cf\u7684\u60c5\u666f\u63cf\u8ff0\uff0c\u4ee5\u666f\u5e36\u4eba\uff0c\u5c0d\u767d\u53cd\u800c\u986f\u5c11\uff0c\u820a\u5f0f\u7684\u7de8\u6392\u4e5f\u9020\u6210\u95b1\u8b80\u7684\u4e0d\u6613\u3002"}, {"userName": "Wintersweet Cui", "userReviewDate": "May 10, 2018", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/75868073-wintersweet-cui", "userReview": "Pretty women can't have happy ending easily."}, {"userName": "Chenye G", "userReviewDate": "Jan 12, 2017", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/44362719-chenye-g", "userReview": "A sad story.."}, {"userName": "Jaimie Lau", "userReviewDate": "Sep 13, 2016", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/59619082-jaimie-lau", "userReview": "Where the book falls down is its inability to engage the reader and make them willing to invest into the characters themselves.

With such an unlikeable protagonist, the book screams out with the need for other characters to invest in but alas, they are flat, underdeveloped and are all discarded with in the same manner that Wang Qiyao herself throws them to the side.

The characters aren't fleshed out, the plot is meandering and there is so much \"telling\" instead of \"showing.\" It can't just be a bad translation; this is a bad bad book. It is so unnecessarily long and miserable; I've never read a book with a more apt title. GAH!"}, {"userName": "Kathleen", "userReviewDate": "Jul 02, 2011", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/2247489-kathleen", "userReview": "This book received rave reviews, but I thought it was rather long. The author's writing style is not terse by any standard, though it may have suffered during the translation. The subtitle is apt. I think it should be read as the story of Shanghai rather than that of the main character. I would hesitate before giving a general recommendation to read it."}, {"userName": "Kerry", "userReviewDate": "Aug 25, 2008", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/657269-kerry", "userReview": "This had a starred review in Publishers' Weekly, and although I only made it about 100 pages in I just couldn't take it any more.

This is an elegant book meant to be read slowly and savored. Although Wang Qiyao's story spans four decades (1940s - 80s), the history of China remains in the background. It is Wang Qiyao's inability to maintain human relationships that creates her sorrow."}, {"userName": "Kc", "userReviewDate": "Jun 19, 2008", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/831527-kc", "userReview": "I liked Song in large part because it evoked a time and place with for which I had very little reference and taught me about it.

During the next four decades, Wang Qiyao indulges in the decadent pleasures of pre-liberation Shanghai, secretly playing mahjong during the antirightist Movement and exchanging lovers on the eve of the Cultural Revolution. Surviving the vicissitudes of modern Chinese history, Wang Qiyao emerges in the 1980s as a purveyor of \"old Shanghai\"--a living incarnation of a new, commodified nostalgia that prizes splendor and sophistication--only to become embroiled in a tragedy that echoes the pulpy Hollywood noirs of her youth.From the violent persecution of communism to the liberalism and openness of the age of reform, this sorrowful tale of old China versus new, of perseverance in the face of adversity, is a timeless rendering of our never-ending quest for transformation and beauty.", "title": "The Song of Everlasting Sorrow: A Novel of Shanghai", "url": "http://www.goodreads.com/book/show/3114060-the-song-of-everlasting-sorrow", "average": 3.88, "cover": "https://images.gr-assets.com/books/1347986413l/3114060.jpg", "reviews": 44, "authors": [{"url": "https://www.goodreads.com/author/show/5481722.Wang_Anyi", "name": "Wang Anyi"}, {"url": "https://www.goodreads.com/author/show/327056.Michael_Berry", "name": "Michael Berry"}, {"url": "https://www.goodreads.com/author/show/1062756.Susan_Chan_Egan", "name": "Susan Chan Egan"}, {"url": "https://www.goodreads.com/author/show/14876978._", "name": "\u738b\u5b89\u5fc6"}], "type": ["Cultural", "Historical", "Fiction", "Cultural", "Literature"], "outlinks": ["http://www.goodreads.com/book/show/3114060-the-song-of-everlasting-sorrow", "http://www.goodreads.com/book/show/6571039-the-song-of-everlasting-sorrow", "http://www.goodreads.com/book/show/12289886-the-song-of-everlasting-sorrow", "http://www.goodreads.com/book/show/26173117", "http://www.goodreads.com/book/show/11292145-chang-hen-ge", "http://www.goodreads.com/book/show/1572300.Baotown", "http://www.goodreads.com/book/show/7427433-the-little-restaurant", "http://www.goodreads.com/book/show/2011779.Love_in_Small_Town", "http://www.goodreads.com/book/show/987760.Brocade_Valley", "http://www.goodreads.com/book/show/541862.Love_on_a_Barren_Mountain"]}
