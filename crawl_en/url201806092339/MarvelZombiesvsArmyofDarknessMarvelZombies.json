I do however still know enough about the main protagonists and vagaries to know the basics.Fortunately, that is where the nature of this book actually lends itself. You don't have to be an expert on either horror movies or the Marvel universe to be able to enjoy this book.Far from being what some puritans would probably refer to as a \"true\" Marvel novel, this should be treated far more as a standalone, utterly separate story, that if it were a musical or video output would undeniably labelled a 'mash up'.I won't delve too deep in case of accidentally unleashing any spoilers but suffice to say the only story element you should know is that Ash (wise-cracking brash zombie killer from The Evil Dead) has just been killed, only to wake up in this \"strange world of pumped up freaks in spandex\" which soon finds itself under assault from an unknown plague which turns its sufferers into sentient zombies.There are some nice little zigzags in the plot and enough irreverent humour to keep this from feeling like a generic cash cow flogging idea. As I said earlier, even if you're familiar with the majority of Marvel characters or have never seen Evil Dead, the juxtaposition between the two, at least in this book, makes for a fun accessible read."}, {"userName": "Andy Phillips", "userReviewDate": "Mar 28, 2014", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/19488649-andy-phillips", "userReview": "I'll read anything about zombies, so received this as a present. I don't really know very much about superheroes and graphic novels, beyond who most of the more famous characters are, but I quite enjoyed this. I think that some sort of knowledge of the backstory and the more minor characters would have been a benefit though. I also don't think the character of Ash will mean much unless you have seen at least one 'Evil Dead' film.The story is essentially as described in the blurb. Ash travels from another dimension and lands in a version of New York where superheroes are commonplace. He is followed by a superhero (who I don't recognise) who is infected with the zombie virus. A huge fight then follows as various other heroes wade in while the infected kill and eat the human population. Will the infection get out of control, or can Ash use his experience battling The Deadites to stop it?This publication includes the complete story (of 5 chapters), so there's no need to wait for the next instalment. It's a pretty good story, albeit a little odd, but I think you should expect that given the subject matter. Worth a look if you have any interest in at least two of the following:1) Zombies2) Superheroes3) The Evil Dead4) Graphic novels or comics"}, {"userName": "Joseph R.", "userReviewDate": "Sep 03, 2014", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/4737491-joseph-r", "userReview": "Ash, hero from the Evil Dead/Army of Darkness franchise, travels through an inter-dimensional portal and winds up in the Marvel Universe. Unfortunately, one of the deadites also comes through and infects the Avengers, who begin eating everyone in sight, thus starting a zombie apocalypse. Ash races around trying to find the Necronomicon (the ancient Sumerian book of the dead that causes the dead to rise and feast on human flesh) and change the superheroes back into, well, superheroes. He gets assistance from Spider-man, The Punisher (though not much assistance), and Dazzler, though things go from bad to worse. By \"worse\" I mean Ash eventually works with Doctor Doom!The story is a fun excuse to have Ash wise-crack his way through most of the Marvel roster. The humor is good if you like Evil Dead 2 or Army of Darkness. The gore is a bit gross but not as over the top as other zombie comics. It's a bit juvenile, not missing the chance to show scantily-clad heroines who rebuff Ash's advances. The book is really for Evil Dead fans more than anyone else."}, {"userName": "Vanessa", "userReviewDate": "Jul 07, 2011", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/752176-vanessa", "userReview": "Much like real zombies, Marvel's successful zombie series wouldn't die. This entry is a crossover with Dynamite Entertainment featuring Ash and his boomstick. If I have to explain that Ash is from The Evil Dead trilogy, we both already know this is probably not your kind of reading material. I was bound to like this just for throwing Ash and the Necronomicon into the Marvel Zombie mix but this entry isn't as good as the the ones written by Robert Kirkman (better known for his other zombie series, The Walking Dead.)The writer here, John Layman, also makes the curiously contrary choice to pair Ash up with Dazzler and Scarlet Witch, neither of whom are exactly the most well-known or...compelling of Marvel heroes. Fun but not as awesomely campy as the original. This edition does contain more excellent zombied up variations on classic Marvel covers by Arthur Suydam in the coda.

Was it odder than MArvel Zombies 5? No, I guess not. In fact it came off as way more superhero-ee than that one (the addition of seeing what doom was up to was cool). I'm not the worlds biggest Army of Darkness fan, I don't dislike it, I'm just pretty much indifferent to it. I generally walk away from reading it enjoying it and enjoying all the superhero stuff and wishing it had ALL been superhero stuff and that Ash just hadn't been there."}, {"userName": "Jukka Kuva", "userReviewDate": "Feb 12, 2013", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/17391988-jukka-kuva", "userReview": "A crossover comic where Ash battles the Marvel Zombies. Where the original Marvel Zombies stories work, this one just fails. There's very little of the original stories' charisma left and Ash seems like a totally different character than in the movies. You only recognize him from the chainsaw, boomstick and dull repetitions of some movie one liners. Long story short: this is not funny, nor does it give practically any more content to the main story.An useless crossover which some may enjoy but I'm not among them."}, {"userName": "Zoey", "userReviewDate": "May 05, 2014", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/2814302-zoey", "userReview": "I liked the idea, but I really didn't like the main character Ash; I was hoping he'd get eaten. I also questioned some of the logic: Spiderman's spider bite warded off the infection, but Captain America was infected despite the Super Soldier Serum? And Wolverine's ridiculous healing factor prevent him from being infected?Anyway, those bits aside it was a decent read, and I always like it when female superheroes get a decent amount of page-time."}, {"userName": "Mazzeo", "userReviewDate": "Jan 11, 2008", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/243363-mazzeo", "userReview": "This graphic novel is borderline fan fiction. While it\u2019s reasonably well written and the art is good the story definitely feels like a bunch of people said \u201cwouldn\u2019t that be cool\u201d around a dinner table one evening. The story revolves around Ash, from the Evil Dead films, as he runs through the marvel universe attempting to stop the undead yet again.

However, this one piqued my interest because of the AOD tie-in. I mean, Marvel and Dynamite Entertainment? Come on, that has to be pretty weird. All in all, it was incredibly and shamelessly corny as one would expect an AOD/Marvel collaboration to be, but still a pretty funny read. I'd recommend the book to any Bruce Campbell fan."}, {"userName": "Angel ", "userReviewDate": "Apr 20, 2009", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/190365-angel", "userReview": "There is a good blend of humor with zombie thrill to make this an entertaining reading. Fans of Ash Williams and Army of Darkness will likely enjoy this take. I enjoyed how he was able to use his fast thinking and previous experiences to get out of trouble, well, sort of. The zombies premise in this Marvel series is interesting, and the addition of Ash Williams adds a nice sense of light humor. Definitely enjoyable."}, {"userName": "Wolverinefactor", "userReviewDate": "Apr 24, 2013", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/3932259-wolverinefactor", "userReview": "Now this is what I'm talkign about. The explanation of the Marvel Zombies is awesome for any Evil Dead fan and the fact that this is a direct continuation of the Army of Darkness comic makes it that much better. If anyone is interested in the series you just need to read this, MZ 1-2 and Returns. They offer the best plot of them all and are coherent together.

I thought this was very entertaining and true to both the Marvel Universe and Ash Williams' character. I have almost no complaints. My one problem with it is that a different artist drew an issue or two and it ended up looking a little disjointed.

It jumps all over the Marvel Universe in a clear attempt to get Ash to interact with as many Marvel heroes as possible, instead of having a really consistent storyline.
