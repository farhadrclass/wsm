I was a bit disappointed by the wife's role and with the ending, since I saw both coming a mile away. But fine, so the story was a little predictable. No biggie. I was still entertained.That said . . .What drove Anal Retentive Me twitching-crazy? Spelling errors. Lots and lots of them. And nothing makes me crazier than unwillingly shifting into editing mode when I'm reading for pleasure. Somebody really needs to tell the editor/writer that \"its\" and \"it's\" fulfill different purposes. That \"waiving\" is never a substitute for the gesture of \"waving.\" That . . . oh, never mind. You get the idea.So. IF you enjoy zombie books and IF you can suspend your inner editor, LZR-1143 is a fun read.

Mike was a popular action movie star, when he claimed he had no memory of his wife\u2019s brutal murder, he is convicted of criminal insanity and locked away. But did he do it? How could he remember if they keep him doped up on medications? And then it happened, he began seeing zombies, had he lost his mind for real or was there something horrendous going on? If Mike thought his life had become nightmare before, the world he would escape into would make anything before that pale in comparison.Governments are collapsing under the gory chaos of the walking dead and the world becomes fodder for the living dead.

So tons of people die, there are graphic depictions of gore, and a larger-than-life protagonist. If zombie books aren\u2019t your thing, then you won\u2019t enjoy this book. For those who enjoy a novel full of the undead and some good guys who try to battle and survive their encounters with reanimated while trying to find a cure, then this might be the next book for you. But first, a few warnings:Mr. James must keep a thesaurus within arm\u2019s reach at all times. He also uses very long, detailed sentences that often take away from the plot. While I appreciate descriptive prose, this goes overboard. Way, too far, beyond the pale overboard (this is the kind of description you will find in Infection). Also, the protagonist, Mike McKnight, was very annoying. He was sarcastic, which is probably a solid defense mechanism when facing the undead, but his sarcasm was predictable. And after a sarcastic remark, McKnight congratulates himself or explains his sarcasm, which brings me to his internal dialogue with himself. This ongoing dialogue is not really made clear until later in the book when the internal voice is explicitly recognized. This internal voice gets old, especially when it/he keeps droning on about either the mental institute or the evening that this wife is killed and how he can\u2019t remember most of the events.Having said that, the plot is actually quite good. There were a few spots throughout the book where I actually found myself surprised or caught off guard. Mr. James would off a character, and I didn\u2019t see it coming. The plot moves quite quickly (although it could move faster if the flowery language were kept to a minimum). However, the ending was a bit off. [SPOILER ALERT] The scientist who is discovered in the research facility, after explaining that the vials of blue liquid are a vaccine and not a cure (GASP!) is baited into addressing why in the heavens he would do such a thing. The scientist, seemingly out of the blue, begins to blame liberals, the Hollywood elite, and the gays and explain that he is doing the work of God. This came out of nowhere and, quite frankly, went nowhere. And then a character from earlier in the book returns and, of course, is a bad guy. But why was he a bad guy? There\u2019s a brief mention of why McKnight was placed in the mental institute, but we never really learn why this guy was bad. And finally, the ending. Bad. It just stops. McKnight wakes up in a dirty white room and has no scars or wounds. He feels that the room is familiar but it cannot be [presumably the mental institute where the book began]. He reaches for the door handle. The end. Seriously, the end. Granted there is a sequel, but I am not really inclined to read it, but I kinda want to know where McKnight was. So the ending was quite disappointing. But to be honest, when you pick up a book like this, especially for free, you know you aren\u2019t getting a Pulitzer-worthy book. And, as other reviewers mentioned, there are errors throughout the book (misspellings, punctuation issues, etc.). But they aren't so bad as to take away from the story. 3.5 Stars."}, {"userName": "Fred", "userReviewDate": "Oct 15, 2017", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/5708307-fred", "userReview": "\u201cLemme guess,\u201d I said, affecting the appropriate sarcastic tone. \u201cWe\u2019re running low on gas?\u201d He nodded curtly, eyes on the road.

It probably wasn't the best Zombie book I've read but it was good enough that I'll still read the second one since I scored the Kindle version for free. This is the story about a action movie star married to a beautiful bio-engineer working on reanimating the dead and conquering death itself. Nothing could go wrong right? Well, surprise, it does. And action guy ends up only revealing his wife who went all bitey McBiteface on him in the flashbacks he has throughout the rest of this story. In the end we find out that, whatever her faults, she at least smuggled a vaccine out to Jean Claude and managed to inject him, so there's that. Not as if it makes up for the endless suffering inflicted on mankind and all of that.The writing isn't the best, but it'll work for cheap pulp action flicks and easy reads."}, {"userName": "Sara", "userReviewDate": "Feb 13, 2014", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/1776370-sara", "userReview": "Copied from the review I left on Amazon...As I was trying to decide on the the number of stars to give this book, I found my cursor hovering between four stars and three stars. If I could give it 3.5 stars, I would have. It's a little more than \"okay\", but I can't enthusiastically say I \"liked\" it.Quick Summary:The main character, Michael McKnight, is an inmate at a facility for the criminally insane. He wakes up one day to discover that he has been left behind at the mental hospital while the United States is becoming overrun with the living dead. During the first few scenes, the reader learns that McKnight is in the facility for supposedly murdering his wife. A crime he doesn't recall committing, but assumes had to be true. McKnight, a former action movie star, finds his way out of the facility with the help of a woman psychiatrist from the hospital wing. From there, the characters face all kinds of horrors. McKnight thinks he may be able to find a way to cure- or stop the spread of- whatever it is that is turning people into zombies. This is because he is starting to remember bits and pieces of his life before his wife's murder. His wife was a doctor at a research facility and had mentioned a project involving reanimation of the dead. As McKnight and his new psychiatrist friend make their way to the research center, they face all the horrors expected in a zombie-filled world. That's all I will write for a summary... I don't like spoilers.What I Liked:1) The author seems to have a good sense of humor. I liked the many witty comments made by the main character in the story.2) The story-line is an interesting take on the whole zombie apocalypse scenario.3) Bryan James is a good storyteller & keeps the action going strong.4) I like the two main characters- while not entirely believable, they are likable.5) The beginning of the book grabbed my attention.What I Did Not Like:1) There are way too many \"coincidences\" that I found irritating after a while. For example, lights going off at just the right time and coming back on at just the right time... televisions that just \"happen\" to work long enough for the main characters to get just the right information... recorded videos that just \"happen\" to be cued and ready to watch. Those are just a few examples.2) I liked the main character, but I found him very difficult to relate to.3) There could have been more character development. The story is told in first-person, which I like, but even with being able to be in McKnight's mind, there didn't seem to be much to him... other than he wonders if he truly is crazy.4) Some of the scenes are so unbelievable, it was hard for me to overlook. Yes, it is a story about zombies, so of course it's going to be unbelievable to a large extent. I don't want to create a spoiler, but a certain scene sticks out in my mind where one of the minor characters has her arm hacked off by an ax. Even with this major injury and very little medical help, she is able to continue traveling and evading hundreds of pursuing zombies (for a while, that is). The extent of my medical knowledge is limited to the application of Neosporin and a Band-Aid, but this just doesn't seem right to me.It's not a bad book, but I was expecting it to be better because of other reviews. This is the first book in the series, so I am holding out hope that they will only improve with time. I will give the sequel to Infection a try after I read some other authors on my list of books I want to read."}, {"userName": "J.R.", "userReviewDate": "Jul 19, 2012", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/7586367-j-r", "userReview": "LZR-1143 introduces us to Mike a one-time Hollywood action hero who was a serious box office draw. Mike has been accused of killing his wife but has no memory of doing so. This places him in a mental institution instead of prison but that\u2019s not always a good thing. He\u2019s essentially remanded to his cell where he\u2019s heavily sedated for fear that somehow; he could become violent with possible repressed violent schizophrenic tendencies. Waking up one morning, he finds himself in the TV room with no supervision, no escorts and no morning dose of anti-psychotics. Not that he needed the medication to begin with but I\u2019ll get into that later. Meanwhile, the world outside the walls of the facility has changed into a land of the walking dead.It takes some time for Mike to come out of his nightly dose of meds to realize that the dead have been reanimated and some are inside with him, wandering the halls seeking fresh victims. After initial contact with one, he escapes unbitten and is able to meet up with a few other fellow survivors. These survivors consist of Kate, one of the doctors and a few patients. One particular patient, Fred, is blessed with a one word vocabulary, \u2018pancake\u2019 which adds to some of the dark humor throughout the story.The story moves on from the asylum as they escape, run into more infected, a bad cop, a Target store night manager and of course, several thousand infected all while dragging along a couple of mental patients.As the storyline progresses, the reader, as well as the primary character, Mike, are shown flashbacks to Mike\u2019s life prior to incarceration. This lends a nice spin to the plot as Mr. James beautifully incorporates it into the current flow of the story instead of sidetracking the reader with paragraphs or chapters that move away from the core of the tale. Mike slowly and eventually gets his memory back of what happened the night he allegedly killed his wife and the truth is shocking. While I began to suspect there was another reason for the murder and then started to put the pieces together as I read, some of it didn\u2019t make too much sense until the ending chapters where it was all explained. Or was it?While the cause for the infection was explained and the reason behind his wife\u2019s murder which he was wrongly accused of are all laid out, the ending makes the reader sit back and wonder if what they read really happened or was it a hallucinogenic reaction to the medication that was administered to Mike and the entire course of events only occurred in his drug addled mind.I have to say that Mr. James has written one of the better novels in this genre to come my way in a long time. He successfully combined a murder mystery, political intrigue, industrial espionage and cover-up into a zombie/apocalyptic/horror genre novel and made it work.I\u2019m very much looking forward to the next book in this series."}, {"userName": "Karen", "userReviewDate": "Dec 24, 2012", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/15411105-karen", "userReview": "This was a really good zombie story that has it's own little twist. The main characters are somewhat light in the beginning but get fleshed out nicely by the end, though there is still room for more development. The story is fast paced and brings things to a critical point pretty quickly. There is a bit of a mystery as to how things got started as well as the mystery surrounding the death of the main characters wife, though that seems to have been figured out. The language is straight and conveys the thoughts and actions of the characters perfectly.The narrator is an ex-action hero and movie star, Michael McKnight, who was convicted of killing his wife and committed to a mental hospital as criminally insane. He does not remember killing her or anything else about that time, and they keep him so doped up he can barely function. When he wakes up and finds all the staff and a number of the patients gone he has no idea what happened until an orderly wanders in and eats the only other patient he has seen.Michael meets Kate, a psychiatrist and some of her patients as he tries to escape the hospital. They get out together only to be confronted with the reality that the dead are walking and trying to kill them. Michael is having flashbacks and is sure that they are a way to redeem himself by saving the world, or maybe he really is crazy and its all a delusion.The zombies are gross, the infection is fast, and the world is being devastated quickly. The only thing that really annoyed me about this was that it seemed to end so abruptly. I know there is another book but it could have given a better lead in for it. Still good though!"}, {"userName": "Darke Conteur", "userReviewDate": "Jan 26, 2015", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/4592992-darke-conteur", "userReview": "I found this book after I downloaded about seven free zombie books. None of the previous seven kept my attention for longer than the first page, and I was hesitant about reading this one, but after reading the sample, I decided to buy it. Movie star Mike McKnight, incarcerated in a mental institute, wakes up from a psychotic drug-induced sleep into a world that's gone to hell. Zombies litter the landscape of his hospital, and after a brief fight with the undead, he meets up with some survivors and head off to find a cure.I gave this book two stars because, as strong as the writing was (which is why I purchased it), there were still too many things that I couldn't get into. I understand it's a fantasy story, and for this type (zombie) there has to be a certain element of believing in the impossible, but for me, there has to be an thread of logic to keep me in that frame of mine. I can believe almost anything in a story as long as it seems logical, and most of this didn't. The characters found exactly what they needed, when they needed it, and the sarcastic tone throughout the book (and from just about every character) started to weigh the story down."}, {"userName": "Kathryn", "userReviewDate": "Oct 29, 2016", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/1187425-kathryn", "userReview": "I really considered giving this book only one star. There were so many things about it I just didn't like. The biggest were the spelling and grammar mistakes. One mistake I can forgive but when there's a mistake what seems like every few pages it's too much. There was also a lack of continuity. The character would be sitting one moment and the next he's somehow somewhere else without having moved, or in one paragraph he sits down and the following paragraph he takes a seat. I found the main character himself boring. The idea of him being famous was pushed too hard and brought up too often making it feel forced. I also disliked the constant inner-monologue of the main character that slowed the story down quite a bit. The action was also overdone. It was never one or two zombies posing a threat but always dozens and at one point over a hundred. The beginning was fun and interesting with the main character discovering the outbreak and I enjoyed his flashes trying to remember his wife, but otherwise everything felt very contrived and the plot twists very convenient."}, {"userName": "Olethros", "userReviewDate": "Oct 20, 2014", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/18503124-olethros", "userReview": "-Sobre tendencias habituales, un protagonista algo particular.-G\u00e9nero.

The main character being someone well-known and well-off rather than the usual Joe Schmoe that normally accompanies this kind of book was a departure from the normal premise. However: Michael McKnight is annoying as hell (he's one of those guys who doesn't know when to take it down a notch with the sarcasm - and this is coming from someone who speaks said language fluently). I found him irritating quite often, but not quite to the point of wanting him to get eaten alive. I also wasn't a fan of the senseless inner voice. Is he schizophrenic? DID? My LEAST favorite part of this book was how it ended. Abruptly. In some random room. I guess the current story arc was fulfilled enough to end the episode, but that was no season finale, and there are too many questions still left unanswered.Nevermind. The second book is on Amazon for free. Well, okay, no. My irritation at how the first book \"ends\" still stands, but it's definitely offset by the fact that I'm going to go download and read the second book right now and pretend that it isn't broken up into two different sections. ;DETA: I must have gotten a further edited copy of the book from many of the previous reviews, because I didn't see a lot of typos.

If given the choice, I'd rate this book a 3.5. I enjoyed the storyline and the action, and the humor was well placed. Each character is unique, and adds something truly special and necessary to the story. Mike McKnight's backstory was an interesting one, and I liked how it unfolded over time. This book gave me a different take on the zombies themselves, as they seemed to be able to seek out their prey a little more than the zombies I'm used to reading about or seeing on TV. The cause of this Zombie \"Apocalypse\" is also something I can see as being somewhat possible in the real world, which added to my enjoyment of the story. I wasn't thrilled with the ending, or with the role that our hero's wife played in all of this, which is why I couldn't bring myself to give a higher rating. However, as I've already started reading the second book in this series, the aspects of the first book that left me disappointed were somewhat made right in the beginning of the second book.

Zombie novels tend to be much of a muchness, but this had a cracking good start and I read through to the end without noticing much - if anything- in the way of SPaG errors, probably because I was enjoying it too much!

Mike McKnight (stupid name) is in a facility for the criminally insane that to me was a very interesting background so i expected some \"grittyness\" like some kind of heavy psychological undertones to the characters to come. haha NOPE! neither mike nor his cliche love interest Dr. Kate have any personality at all. all my boy mike does is make little wise cracks, sadly that overused trait can't make up for his and Kate's lack of substance. the little they tell about mike is that he was your standard good looking hollywood douche with a huge ego until he kills his wife but guess what he was FRAMED. God forbid Mike be interesting at all in the slightest. and Kate is completely un-unique and could be replaced by anyone. they tried to give both some sob story but sense it took up about three sentences i didn't care. and i love how Kate just automatically believes mike is innocent because the \"timing of the autopsy was off\" she was a psychiatrist in college at the time so how come she is an expert on the subject all of the sudden? once Mike's innocence was introduced (it was obvious from the beginning but i mean when they outright say it) i knew that the genericness was in full effect. also the romantic sub plot was so bad. they just seem to bond from nothing like some kind of Stockholm syndrome where being stuck together trying to survive just conjured love out of nowhere. This should be labeled as a comedy because half the dialogue is witty banter between characters. also every once in awhile the author tries to impress me with his existential philosophy but since the whole book is from a rich prick's pov, i wasn't interested. then the plot tried to introduce a conspiracy theory and guess what (again SPOILER) Mike's wife helped create the zombie virus and he was framed for killing her zombified corpse (wooow so convenient) but right before she tried to eat him she gave him the cure (i guess the power of love was too strong).Overall the book wanted horror and suspense but had none. it tried to be funny but the barrage \"wit\" was distracting, cliche, and poorly done. every plot twist was seen a mile away but most of all, if someone put a gun to my head and said list five personality traits for Mike and his love interest (or more accurately the hot chick he wants to screw) i wouldn't be able to do it. you could give me a year and all i could come up with would be \"smart ass\" or \"annoying\"2/10 would not recommend"}, {"userName": "D.elliott", "userReviewDate": "Sep 12, 2014", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/23663744-d-elliott", "userReview": "Bryan James's 'LZR-1143: Infection' was on Amazon for free, so at a loose end with nothing left on my bookshelf to read, I downloaded it. I was pleasantly surprised, though for the first day of reading this, I couldn't get the A-Team tune out of my head coupled with a comical picture the author had painted from the first scene, which was pretty hilarious!Anyway, the novel opens with the central character, Michael, withdrawing from his state issued concoction of mind numbing narcotics whilst locked on a high security wing of mental institution in the middle of a zombie apocalypse. Not an ideal situation, and not the typical opening to zombie novel either so I was definitely intrigued to read on.There's so many zombie novels at the moment that they have to have something different to allow them to stand out. What stood out for me was the Michael's narrative voice. I really like it! It was sardonic and comically inappropriate at all the right times. The central character was flawed but likeable: who ever needed the perfect hero anyway! So, although Michael probably wouldn't be your first choice in PA buddy, since he's just escaped from an asylum and is battling with his own inner demons as the literal ones attacking from all angles, he's certainly an entertaining character to follow. Without giving too much away, from the ending and the author's acknowledgement, I'd say this novel is more than your straight forward blood and guts mindless zombie fun: Bryan James has something else to say and I'll be plugging into the rest of the series to discover just what is that something else?Yes, there is a cliffhanger at the end but you know what, the author is giving the first instalment out for free. Nobody is being charged for a cliff hanger; personally I don't think Bryan James can be blamed for using some inventive marketing to get the readers to buy his next instalment!"}, {"userName": "Jane Kelsey", "userReviewDate": "Jul 16, 2014", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/3203726-jane-kelsey", "userReview": "LZR-1143: Infection is THE Zombie novel to read if you are a fan of the genre! I don\u2019t just like this guy\u2019s writing, I absolutely love it!Mike McKnight (ha!), and ex-action movie star is a mental patient at the high security facility after he was convicted of brutally murdering his wife. More than a year passed since they locked him in there and one morning he wakes up from his normal stupor, the door to his room open and nobody in sight. But he is not alone. From deep within the darkness, something hideous comes out in search for flesh.Soon after his encounter with the first flesh-eater, Mike finds himself in the company of a young female psychiatrist and some other inmates, my favourite being Fred. This forms an off pair in a post-apocalyptic world overrun by Zombies. They manage to escape the institution and facing more and more dangers in their quest for food and safety while their numbers fall short as the ravaging infection takes over.I loved the style of the book and the fact that the story is shown through the eyes of Mike\u2019s character. I liked the witty banter and the way the writer decided to express himself and keep me on the hook. Also the fact that the main character was a hunk with a memory loss and prosecuted for murder makes him unique and entertaining, especially when people, the few ones still alive, recognise him.....(Read my full review at http://janekelsey.wordpress.com/2014/...)"}, {"userName": "Unapologetic_Bookaholic", "userReviewDate": "Oct 14, 2014", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/1125077-unapologetic-bookaholic", "userReview": "**This review may contain spoliers. Tags provide theme, subject and setting etc** I really enjoyed this ZA novel. The main character is in a mental hospital. So I am wondering if this his thoughts are based in reality or his dreams. It held me in limbo until the end. So the story begins with a man in a mental hospital. He wakes up, or comes out of his drug haze and realizes something is very wrong. He wanders the hospital until he realizes that he has the right to leave. No one is manning the floor so he instinct is to flee. He encounters what he soon figures out is a zombie. He is able to fend off the first attacks. He meets up with another group on his way out of the hospital. Halfway through the group has been thinned by run-ins with zed's. I won't give too much away but any fan of ZA novels know the premise of survival. So the only questions are: How do they survive and is there a cure. There is plenty of running and racing against time to find a \"cure\". All the while the MC's inner dialog is suggesting this might all very well be in his head. I look forward to book two!Story rating: 4 Action/rush factor: 4 Total rating: 4"}, {"userName": "Rolando Gill", "userReviewDate": "May 07, 2011", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/5004167-rolando-gill", "userReview": "I actually got caught up in the story and did not want it to end. I was impressed by the author's development of the characters, development of scenes and the slow reveal of the real story. Very well done in many ways. There were some weaknesses but I only remembered them after reading the book in one sitting. First person storytelling in my experience fizzles but not this one. Spell check and a more careful edit would have helped. Waiving is not waving, this error repeated and there were several others that distracted. In my opinion the author considers the witty retort to be one of his strengths and it turns out that most if not all of the characters in the story are able to deliver the zinging retort pretty regularly. Maybe just a little unbelievable. The \"pancake\" character ending was over the top and unnecessary and felt very forced. However, these are all minor nitpicky weaknesses to a very good story with a great protagonist."}, {"userName": "Peace Love and Reviews", "userReviewDate": "Mar 26, 2012", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/1963075-peace-love-and-reviews", "userReview": "Mike McKnight woke up the same way the protagonist of on 28 Days movie - Jim and Walking Dead - Rick Grimes woke up. World in chaos and zombies taking over the world he knew. I do not know how can these three possibly survived while in a medically induced sleep. But they did. I am not sure what to make of Mike. Former actor convicted of killing his wife, pronounced as criminally insane. Pretty good start. There is a lot of running, shooting and trying not to get bitten, all pretty standard stuff. As soon as his first memory resurfaced I already knew that his wife and her project was connected to what had happened. The stroy was predictable but Mike isn't, he have an unstable character. The voices inside his head bugs me (in a good way). I do not know if he really has some mental issues or this is how he weighs his decisions. The ending of the book is quite interesting, a cliff ahnger!
