I do enjoy romance novels especially when intertwined with time-travel. This is a cute love story of two people from two different worlds.Jessica Blakely, travelling in England, wishes upon a star one night to meet her prince charming. She's then somehow transported to the year 1260 and meets up with Richard De Galtres, a knight who is feared by all. All except Jessica, who drives him nuts with her self-confidence and out-spoken thoughts. Over time, Richard starts falling in love with her as she slowly breaks down his tough and angry traits and replacing it with love and laughter, something he has never experienced before.Even though I enjoyed reading this book giving it four stars, I thought the love between Richard and Jessica, lacked passion. Not to mention that it didn't have any sexy heart-pounding love scenes. I also had a very hard time believing that her mother accepted her daughter's adventure without batting an eye. I also have to question some of the items that Jessica took back with her to 1260. I know, I know. It's fiction but still....."}, {"userName": "Debbie", "userReviewDate": "Nov 28, 2008", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/1709540-debbie", "userReview": "The book is mainly set in the medieval period. The world-building in this book is excellent, and the characters are well-drawn. The pacing is good, and every scene serves a purpose. The focus is more on the romance than the history. The book will probably appeal most to women who have always wished to marry a knight in shining (or not so shining) armor. There are no explicit sex scenes, but the main characters do have sex after they're married. I'd rate this as \"good, clean fun.\""}, {"userName": "Susan (susayq ~)", "userReviewDate": "Aug 10, 2011", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/5305480-susan-susayq", "userReview": "Well, this one is going on my favorites shelf.

Here, we meet Richard de Galtres. Richard was a young boy when he fled the merciless abuse of his father to the magical keep of Artane and became another foster son of Robin and Anne de Piaget. The abuse that he survived has hardened Richard's heart and all that he wants is to rebuild his keep, live in peace, and, maybe, one day marry a child heiress that he can raise to be a quiet and biddable wife so he can have an heir. The last thing he needs or wants is to have Jessica Blakely storm into his life and create a whirlwind of chaos.Jessica finds herself in a medieval castle in England wishing on a star for a truly gallant knight. The next thing she knows, she is hurtled back in time to find herself in the arms of a truly grumpy knight. She is convinced that fate has truly goofed things up. But before long, Jessica starts to see through the armor that Richard keeps around his heart and she starts to touch the tender soul that is hiding within. The artist who can paint pictures that touch her heart, the man who has found the courage to be gallant despite the torments that he lives with, and the love of her life. Together, Richard and Jessica start to create a life together that can be a \"claim to fame\" for them both.But fate isn't quite done with either of them. When Richard's foster brother, Kendrick of Artane, is brutally murdered by the woman he was supposed to marry, Richard and Jessica must travel to Artane so that Richard can help investigate. But Artane is a seat of medieval power and their visit there attracts the notice of the king. With Richard's lands and wealth at stake, Jessica must decide if she can take away from Richard all he holds dear while only offering herself in return.This is another one of Kurland's books that show her true talent. Richard is beyond the sterotypical abused child. That Richard is less than a serial killer based on what he endured in his childhood is hard to imagine. But Kurland makes Richard not only believable, but lovable and endearing, as well. Jessica can, from time to time, be a bit annoying in her attempts to shove twentieth century ideals and values onto Richard, but these moments are few and far between. The love and passion between Richard and Jessica are clear and believable and the gentle love that unfolds between them is beautiful to read.As part of the series, this is a turning point. As must be expected in a series, a beloved character meets his end. Since the beginning of the series, Kendrick is a lovable character. In this story, the arrogant and charming Kendrick works well as a foil to Richard's grumpiness, he brings humor into the story. His character also allows the reader to see that Richard can love. He clearly loves his foster brother and best friend and so it keeps there from being too much of a stretch when we see him falling for Jessica.While this book can be harder than some of the others to get into at the beginning, the end result is worth it. The de Piaget crew continues to grow and to change and to keep the reader coming back for more. Since this book was actually published much earlier than it comes in the chronological timeline, and some books that are chronologically earlier are published after it, there are some characters that are \"missing\" and some that are there that shouldn't be. But due to the fact that the books were not published in chronological order, that is inevitable. This is the one book where that problem comes up if you are reading along with the order that I have given. But the problem comes up toward the end of the book and it is a minor one. Hopefully, a reader can look beyond that and appreciate The More I See You for the treasure that it is! :)"}, {"userName": "Jane Stewart", "userReviewDate": "Sep 28, 2010", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/3789528-jane-stewart", "userReview": "Witty and enjoyable read.I was chuckling out loud several times during this book at witty or unexpected conversations. I enjoyed the romantic story of the gruff never smiling man whose heart was slowly being warmed by a woman from the future. His natural reaction to women was that they were not equal to men and could not do things that men did. He was incredulous that she could not sew or cook. Then he was in awe of her archtectural abilities toward the design and building of his castle. I don't want to give away the ending but I liked it and a question I will phrase related to the ending is what would one bring back from the future if they could? I expect that I'll continue to think about things from the book from time to time. Nice story.Sexual content: mild. Setting: 1999 and 1260 England. Copyright: 1999.

Though wary of Jessica\u2019s mysterious ways, Richard protectively harbors her in his castle by the sea. Though her stubborn will nearly drives him mad, the very sight of her puts a smile on a face that has known too few. And when Jessica\u2019s tender desire pierces the armor around his heart, Richard fears he may never be able to recover \u2013 or resist\u2026Jessica eagerly accepts a month long trip to England (on a university faculty sabbatical) with her blind date, Mr. Stafford III, in hopes of having a \"vacation from her life\" and \"a chance to get some perspective on the Big Picture\" (pg 10) Except shortly into her trip, she makes a wish for \"a man who would love her as much as he loved himself\" (pg 19) and instead of finding herself among manicured bushes in an English garden, she emerges from a fog in the year 1260 at Burwyck-on-the-Sea. Adjusting to a Medieval lifestyle is harder then she expected; especially when she has to deal with Richard de Galtres's stubbornness, preconceptions of women duties (i.e. sewing & cooking...something Jessica knows nothing of), and the lack of music. If this is to become Jessica's new world/life, how will she survive (especially with out chocolate)?I'm a sucker for time-travel tales, especially when they involve a little historical romance as well. So, after reading Lynn Kurland's One Enchanted Evening, I opted for more and, I have to say, I highly enjoyed The More I See You quite a bit. It wasn't as kooky and ridiculous as some time-travel stories can easily become and I enjoyed that Jessica didn't really make it a secret of her time slip. Richards harshness was easy to find displeasing, but you could also easily see him falling for Jessica throughout the book - which was adorable. Happily, the ending wasn't abrupt . . . since you could feel the story winding up quickly, you'll be glad to read more chapters after the fact to tie everything together nicely. Something I love!The reader gets a lot of one on one time with Jessica & Richard for the first half of the book, with a few of Richard's comical guards thrown in here or there. Yet, my favorite interactions were when Jessica was forced to mingle with other Medieval women in the second part of the story and finds a kindred spirit. Sadly, I felt the good-byes at the end were bit rushed though and would have been much harder to accept personally, but the characters do do a great emotional roller-coaster and I even found some other characters (ex. Kendrick & Abby) that I want to continue reading up on in the future. Can't wait!Likes: At least there was more \"parallel action\" in this book compared to the last one I read, One Enchanted Evening. Nothing too graphic, but enough to satisfy my romantic side.Dislikes: They made such a big deal of Richard's past treatment as a child in the first half, but it kind of fizzled away in the second half. I would have liked the fact to have been pursued a little more to get a deeper understanding of his character."}, {"userName": "Ricki Treleaven", "userReviewDate": "Mar 09, 2013", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/3749793-ricki-treleaven", "userReview": "In honor of Valentine's Day this week I re-read The More I See You by Lynn Kurland. Kurland is my very favorite romance writer because she is such a fantastic storyteller. Many critics claim that she out writes other romance writers by a mile, and I tend to agree. Plus, I like that her books are PG or PG-13: They leave plenty to the imagination! ;PThe More I See You is probably my very favorite of all of Lynn Kurland's books. In Kurland's world, a simple wish upon a star can transport you back in time, and that's exactly what happens to Jessica Blakely. Jessica is an up and coming composer and doctoral candidate on holiday in England with her obnoxious professor boyfriend. At a dress-up tea, her boyfriend carries her thrown over his shoulder while he's wearing full mail and armor. She has had enough, so she ditches her date to take a walk. As night falls and mist seeps into the garden, Jessie wishes upon a star for a strong, chivalrous knight. Suddenly, the Victorian extension to the castle disappears, and Jessie is almost run-over by a medieval hunting party. Richard de Galtres is the most fearsome knight in thirteenth-century England. When the hunting party returns to Richard's keep, Burwyck-on-the-Sea, Richard's nightmarish past is slowly revealed to a patient and loving Jessica. Richard razes the old keep to the ground because it reminds him of his abusive father and is rebuilding the castle with stone. Jessie's modern ideas and artistry enchant Richard, and they soon fall in love in the half-built castle.The plot is chock-full of conflict: Richard's internal battle with his past; Richard's superstitious brother who suspects Jessica of being a fairy; a sullen squire who prefers the priesthood and singing to training; and Richard's flirtatious and sexy foster brother Kendrick. This book has more action and violence compared to most of Kurland's other books, but Richard's character more than makes-up for the nail-biting passages. If you haven't read any of Lynn Kurland's romances, you should do yourself a favor and check one out today!Lynn's next romance will be released April 30th. Lynn is also well-known for her fantasy series, too."}, {"userName": "Kimberly", "userReviewDate": "Jan 15, 2015", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/34651418-kimberly", "userReview": "Let me first state that I have never read a book penned by Lynn Kurland before an after finishing this one, I am in love. This book was just perfection to me an it had me hooked within the first couple chapters - it was that good. Everything was just perfect - the characters, the settings, and the story. I suppose it does help that I love a story with a bit of time traveling in it, I mean who wouldn't want to be given the chance to go back in time to see the past, to walk the paths of great men and women before our time, to live and breath the same air, and see the un-altered land before everything was torn apart for our modern conveniences. This book just left me hungering for more, it was like a bag of delicious chocolate chip cookies that melt in your mouth and the tastiest morsel of this story was Jessica and Richards relationship. At times it was down right hilarious - made me snicker a few times - an at other times, it was sweet and beautiful. Richard is a big brutal knight whom seldom gets challenged by others. He has harden himself and his heart off from everyone due to his unpleasant cruel childhood but he slowly lets Jessica in, letting her love him and he love her in return. I loved how when he wanted Jessica to do something or to listen to him (she is a bit independent and free spirited), he would bring up that he was wearing the ring at the moment so therefore it made him Lord and the 'boss' of their chambers. Jealousy... boy is Richard one jealous man when he feels his territory (ie: his lady) is threatened by another man. The jealousy he displays when his friend Kendrick shows up at his castle is priceless, so much so that he became a brooding, bossy, grumpy, and possessive man around Jessica. When I got to the end of the book, I was so happy that they got their happy ending and that it swayed the way I was hoping for. I will definitely be checking out more of Lynn Kurland's books that's for sure."}, {"userName": "Sarah", "userReviewDate": "Feb 07, 2015", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/8219064-sarah", "userReview": "My first in the De Piaget series though for this book at least it doesn't seem to matter so much that it's the 8th book and not the first. Jessica has been enveloped in music since her first piano lessons at five years old, she made her way to college on music scholarships and now makes her living as a composer. Sadly while music has helped her though life it has also taken over her life to the point where she has no friends. Thus we find her on a trip with a blind date in England, *note to self never travel anywhere with a person that you have not known for at least a month! While trying to escape her 'date' she takes a stroll in the gardens and wishes upon a star, and thus her white knight appears out of the mist and she finds her self in a very different place than she had been mere moments before.Welcome to the 13th century! Where women are have little value other than breeding, are treated like servants and are expected to do as there told! We all know that this doesn't fly with any woman of our time and thus the fighting and stand offs begin between Jessica and her white knight Richard De Galtres. Richard has a rather sullen disposition to start with and several fears and insecurities that were instilled by his father as a child(i.e. extreme child abuse). When Jessica appears out of the mist he finds himself woefully unprepared to deal with her. Jessica has her work cut out for her in bringing Richard around to her way of thinking but slowly they start to fall in love with each other. There are several miss steps, misunderstandings and interferences along the way but eventually they both get there HEA.*** So many things that I could say about this book, but I really don't want to ruin it for anyone.

The heroine is thrust back in time and into the very unwilling arms of the hero. He's surly, gruff and without the patience to deal with her as he's urgent to repair his keep. The story really picked up once they arrive at the castle when the two characters go from strangers bound together by chance to a reluctant friendship. The hero is tortured by his abusive childhood and as a result he's very self conscious and unable to properly express his feelings. He never smiles, doesn't know how to be kind but despite this, he's so sweet. Though he's argumentative and brisk, he goes out of his way to make the heroine happy. The heroine just wants to go home. She's often stealing his horse and running away, making the hero track her down and drag her back. But soon she finds herself drawn to him. She sees inside of him and is willing to wait patiently for him to open up to her. I loved this book because it was about real people. The heroine is attacked and as she's recovering, she had to wear a make shift diaper. This is a very simple thing but very rarely do authors pen about it. But Kurland allows the heroine to cry and show utter embarrassment because it allows the hero a chance to comfort her and to grow closer to her. One thing about this book, however, was the fact that it's PG. Absolutely nothing is written about sexual except kisses. Mind you, with the chemistry between the characters, it was hot, but I felt cheated somehow when I wasn't able to experience that natural joining. That being said, I loved this story. It's so much more than a time travel, it's so much more than a cheesy period romance. It's about two lost souls finding each other in the darkness.

Richard is kind of a chauvinist and is very grumpy and gruff all of the time. Not really a guy that you find easy to fall in love with as you read. He kind of bugged me.

It is sweet how she softens him up and also begins to change his mind about women and what they are capable of.
