This series is a bit of a different take on the average cozy mystery in that it has a historical setting mixing both genres wonderfully.Frances Wynn is an American that was born to a wealthy family that found herself in an arranged marriage to her husband, Reggie, that brought Frances the title of the Countess of Harleigh and her husband access to her family funds. In the beginning Frances thought she could learn to love her husband but as time went on she began to see the man he truly was.One night Frances was awakened by a house guest who seemed to be extremely upset, it seems that Frances\u2019 husband Reggie had been in the lady\u2019s bed and passed from a heart attack. To save them all scandal Reggie\u2019s body had been moved back to his own room, the doctor called to pronounce his departure and Reggie buried putting Frances into a season of mourning.Now that Frances\u2019 mourning season is coming to an end a year later she finds that she finally feels free of her philandering husband and his money hungry family. Frances purchases her own home where she\u2019s invited her younger sister Lily to prepare for her first London season. However, before Frances really gets settled she gets a visit from the law claiming they have reason to look into Reggie\u2019s death as a possible homicide leaving Frances to set about finding out what really happened before she\u2019s accused of a crime.Taking a cozy mystery into the past giving it a historical setting had A Lady\u2019s Guide to Etiquette and Murder a fun read right from the start. I wasn\u2019t sure how the historical side would mix with the leading lady going about investigating on her own but the author worked it all into the mix quite nicely keeping the feel of those times. With this being the first of a new series I\u2019m really excited to see what happened next for Frances and the rest of the characters.I received an advance copy from the publisher via NetGalley.For more review please visit https://carriesbookreviews.com/"}, {"userName": "Kester Grant", "userReviewDate": "Feb 12, 2018", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/59915124-kester-grant", "userReview": "The first in a start to a fantastic mystery series, starring the delightfully acid witted Frances - exactly the type of heroine I adore.

There is an understated chemistry between her and the hero, that is smoldering before bursting into flame. The mystery is well-plotted and full of twists.

With the help of her new neighbor and not really welcomed old acquaintance George she gets caught up in investigating the suspects, who are also the suitors of her younger sister.This novel was refreshingly entertaining, with a female protagonist who was funny in a tongue-in-cheek way without being the inept or helpless heroine. Her male sidekick was a little bit flat but likeable none-the-less. The story telling was fast paced and believable. Highly recommended! Interesting tidbits: the novel mentions the use of photographs, telephone, and even a motor car, which prompted me to google the time of invention as I usually don\u2019t find those mentioned in historical novels.

The story centers around an American heiress around the turn of the century (1900s) who finds herself widowed with a young child. While she is wealthy in her own right, she has her brother-in-law and his wife living in her midst with their hands out. The widow strikes out on her own after a year of mourning to break the hand-out cycle with her in-laws and begin to live life anew as an independent single mother in an era where titles and class are of utmost importance. The story weaves through a season when young women are seeking suitors with whom they could marry. So, it is not surprising the younger sister of the widow comes of age and spends a season in the care of her sister and aunt. Through the courting of the sister by various suitors, there are a few sinister situations presented where personal property is either missing or damaged. This leads us through a wild goose chase trying to determine who was in attendance at parties, when the theft or vandalism was revealed, and who is the most viable suspect. Coupling this with in-laws who are determined to maintain the estate and the lifestyle to which they have become accustomed, the in-laws each in their own way are masterminding a plot to control the money and/or the estate."}, {"userName": "Jessi", "userReviewDate": "May 11, 2018", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/1715224-jessi", "userReview": "What's more embarrassing than your husband dying in his mistress's bed?

I was immediately attracted to the prospect of a murder mystery set in Victorian England, one involving a female member of the upper class no less.This is quite a short novel, only about 270 pages or so, and yet it packs quite a lot of events into it. The plot is complex and very, very well developed as we make progress through the pages. The blurb merely mentions the bit about Frances being implicated in her husband's murder, but that's only the tip of the iceberg. The author managed to balance and do justice to several plot developments that the blurb does not mention at all. I don't mention this as a negative point. In fact, I think this is something that works in this book's favour. Readers come in with the expectation of a typical murder mystery but are exposed to quite a complicated plot. The pacing is impeccable for a book of this length and all events are given a sufficient amount of attention in terms of time.The setting is only described briefly and never in long info-dumps. One of the strong points of this author, in fact, is her ability to seamlessly 'show' rather than 'tell', resulting in even the setting becoming revealed to the readers slowly and naturally rather than being shoved in their eyes. The same I will say for the plot. Frances' journey of trying to prove her innocence is very well told and every step of the investigation is explained for the readers' sake. I found this a tad unnecessary at times, but it was quite helpful at others. At first, I was a little disappointed with the characters but they reveal themselves slowly as events unfold around them. Frances herself is 'shown' to be a very headstrong, clever and passionate woman, all of which are qualities that are frowned upon for a woman of her class. I found her and her female companions' attitudes admirable and refreshing. There was a distinct lack of the author shoving any heavy feminism into this and that was a relief. The ending was definitely a surprise and I was relieved that it was unpredictable. I was very satisfied with how the events were unveiled and how the investigation progressed in the midst of the social events and obligations of the upper class folk. I really enjoyed the humour in this book and the insights into other characters from the perspective of Frances were handled very well.There are only a couple of reasons why I gave this 4 stars out of 5. The first is that I wish Frances emotions had been conveyed a little bit better in the beginning of the book. Her remorse at her husband's death could have been given more attention even at the cost of a few extra pages as the length of the book is quite short, to start with. The same should have been done to a few other characters such as George and Lily's suitors. Overall, this was an excellent debut novel and I'm looking forward to reading other works by this author. ---Short review on LitsyARC by NetGalleyThis novel is about Frances Wynn, pulled out of her brief independence from her in-laws by a letter implicating her in her husband's death.The pacing in this short novel was excellent and no words were wasted in info-dump passages. The murder investigation became very complicated but was handled very well. I wish Frances' and Lily's suitors' emotions had been shown a bit better and more.

None of the characters really engaged me, the relationship had no tension, and honestly? There was hardly even a serious mystery or any investigating done. In all? Boring.My major problem was just not feeling anything for the characters. The only one I really liked was George, but even he irritated me at times (the overprotectiveness trope can die already). The rest I just didn't care enough about. That may have partly been behind my lack of investment in the relationship between George and Frances too. I love a slowburn, but there was just no tension to this one. They didn't even really interact that much before starting to call each other by their first names, so there wasn't that much development going on either.In terms of the plot - there really wasn't that much investigating going on until beyond the halfway point. It just kind of drifted along for most of the book, then all of a sudden the mystery is solved. Not to mention the blurb made it sound like Frances being accused of Reggie's murder was going to be a bigger plot point than it was - it ended up being pretty much brushed aside in the end.It was also really hard to work out when this book was supposed to be set. I assumed kind of Austen era, but then there are telephones and cars, so obviously it's later than that. It just didn't really have a distinctive feel to it.
