No wait, chick-light. Anyone who has ever been on an email group will understand the book. You'll even identify with some of the characters. A couple of the characters were simply too extreme and unrealistic. It was funny in places, but mostly I found it annoying. A very light read, but I couldn't get it finished fast enough. This one won't be going on my bookshelf."}, {"userName": "Heather", "userReviewDate": "Jan 03, 2008", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/675793-heather", "userReview": "I am going to start with the things I liked about this book before I get into what I did not.#1- It was fast and laid out in e-mail format throughout which made it fun to read (albeit confusing at times).#2- A couple of the characters were realistic in their SAHM lifestyles.However, what I did not like was:#1- Unless I read the description wrong, I was not under the impression that the basis of this book's \"e-mail group\" was of a religious nature.#2- Some sections were a little dull at times.#3- The sister's e-mails which were randomly thrown in were slightly irritating; not only due to their tone but also because they didn't seem to have a real connection to the story itself.All in all, this book helped passed the time and was decent. Had I known more about the plot (perhaps I did and just overlooked it) I probably would have opted not to read it."}, {"userName": "Kellie", "userReviewDate": "Mar 19, 2012", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/3597682-kellie", "userReview": "A very enjoyable book. Even though this is Christian fiction, and the ladies did talk about praying and God, it didn't feel like you were being preached at. I found the emails to be quite entertaining, especially the stories about the kids. The one who got his head stuck in the cat tower - now that was funny!This was written in a fun, easy format. I'm not a mother, but even I had fun reading about all their trials and tribulations with their husbands and kids."}, {"userName": "Christie", "userReviewDate": "Jan 17, 2009", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/321697-christie", "userReview": "Even though I'm still reading this book I feel confident saying that it will thoroughly entertain any mom who has been a part of a group of any kind. At first I was hesitatnt about whether the style of the novel (nothing but emails!) would be burdensome, but it is quite easy to follow. Already, I have had several laugh out loud moments. Already looking forward to reading the second installment..."}, {"userName": "Leah", "userReviewDate": "Jun 05, 2008", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/1214862-leah", "userReview": "Actually, I didn't read past the first few pages. B.O.R.I.N.G. I hated the format...all emails, no story.

I could really relate with pretty much every character of the book. The format of the book is very interesting, it's told completely through emails. Having a group of moms that I \"speak\" with on a daily basis, it's interesting to see that other moms do the same thing. Even though we're not in the same state, we've all got a baby around the same age. We're all from different backgrounds, we've all had our shares of difficulties. And we're there for each other. Just like the ladies in the book. There is a Christian theme to the book (it being Christian fiction, I'd be surprised if there wasn't.) That said, it wasn't overtly beating you over the head with it Christianity. These women still had faults. They still had problems. And they didn't automatically say \"well, it must be what God wanted.\" They worked on their problems, and did what they could to solve them themselves."}, {"userName": "Kara", "userReviewDate": "Apr 15, 2014", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/1715626-kara", "userReview": "I should NEVER pick up a book based on it's cover. I thought this would be a funny book, maybe with some Mommy conflicts. I did not expect it to be such a steaming pile of religious bull$h!t. It was horrible. Maybe the worst book I've EVER read. The women are weak, and whiny. The characters hide behind religious dogma. Writing the book as if it were emails between friends allowed the author to revel in weak writing styles. I wouldn't recommend this book to anyone, except if you need something to burn."}, {"userName": "Patty", "userReviewDate": "Sep 09, 2008", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/1292947-patty", "userReview": "This book sucked. Get a job. Or a hobby. Or something. For Christ's sweet sake. And HOLY OVERCHRISTIANITY, Batman. P.S. I'm sure it didn't help that I was prepared to judge the author as soon as I read she homeschools ... perhaps I should no longer pick books out of the library when I have my sons with me?) I skimmed this piece of crap just to get to the blessed end so I could say I read it.P.P.S.

I thought some of the character's personalities were over-exaggerated and the content a little too \"I am a great Christian woman doing my Godly duty\" to give it a much higher rating, but if you have ever had toddlers around, it is worth the read to get a few laughs."}, {"userName": "Robyn", "userReviewDate": "May 17, 2010", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/2488824-robyn", "userReview": "I enjoyed only the stay-at-home mom parts of this book. It was mainly way too religious for me. There was bible talk, and pastor's wives, and church stuff, and while I'm Jewish, but non-practicing, and open to other religions, I found it was a bit too much for me. I would not read this book again, and I'm not really sure I recommend it to anyone."}, {"userName": "Alenna", "userReviewDate": "Dec 16, 2011", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/1624932-alenna", "userReview": "Not an unbearable read, but a little too cutesy and predictable for me. And (although not a really big deal), I found it very distracting that every 10-20 random pages, the spacing on the pages switched from single-spaced to double-spaced. Really? No one caught that before the book went to print?"}, {"userName": "Tara", "userReviewDate": "Jun 02, 2008", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/1199867-tara", "userReview": "I started reading this book for the \"SAHM\" part of it. However, it is intensely Christian. Every character in the book is Christian and many are pastor's wives. The e-mail format is cute for a light read, and it is a truly fluff read. I don't mind reading about people who are different from me, but I'd really only recommend this to Christian SAHMs."}, {"userName": "Patty", "userReviewDate": "Jan 08, 2011", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/4705743-patty", "userReview": "This book was ok if there was nothing else around to read. I enjoyed that it was set up as emails and you can see that one person is writing based on an email they just got, but the people receiving the email do not know that the person writing it has this whole \"backstory.\" I think that was the only thing that kept me reading, actually."}, {"userName": "Kim", "userReviewDate": "Jan 11, 2013", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/7244901-kim", "userReview": "I really enjoyed this book. I liked the format becuase it was different and it's nice to have a change in my fiction reading. I thought the book was funny and a nice light read, which I really needed at the time. I am part of an email group for foster parents and I've pretty much been a stay at home mom so maybe that was part of the appeal for me."}, {"userName": "Angela", "userReviewDate": "Jan 12, 2009", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/1860062-angela", "userReview": "It was a super quick read - I managed to swallow it in one day in a few quick sittings.
