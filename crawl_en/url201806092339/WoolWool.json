I didn't think the \"big reveal\" was all that exciting or as terrifying as I'm sure it was meant to be either. And the more I found out about the world, such as the technology or what happened in the past, the more questions I had that were never answered. I realize this is a short story and it continues on, but if you're going to sell me a book it needs to feel whole.Normally when a story features a husband and wife and something happens to one of them I'm a ball of emotions, but this couple's relationship felt flat and mechanical. At one point the guy talks about sobbing through the bars of the jail and I felt absolutely nothing. There's this level of despair that I'm supposed to be feeling for these two people, their relationship, and their potential offspring, but I honestly couldn't care less if the whole silo went up in flames and everybody died. That's probably not a good sign.Thankfully, Howey writes well so I didn't feel like I was slogging through this and I never felt bored, but I'm not the biggest fan of post-apocalyptic dystopia (or short stories, for that matter) so I think fans of the genre would enjoy it more than I did. This is free on Amazon right now and the omnibus version that contains the first five books is only $1.99 (at the time of this review it was, now on 4/6/13 I see it's been bumped up to $5.99. Hrm.) With the first story being so short and also free it's an easy choice to find out for yourself if it's something you'd like to check out or not. I didn't love this story but Howey dangled just enough in front of me that I might want to find out what happens next, but honestly I don't think I'll ever care enough to continue. I just don't think I'm the intended audience.Also, here's hoping my choice to read and review a self-published book doesn't come back to haunt me.

The author masterfully conveys the feeling of desperation, doom, and unrest that stem from questionably voluntary living/imprisonment in the confines of a giant concrete underground shelter in the toxic world, as well as the overpowering need and drive to find out whether there is truth in the faint but forbidden hope that there just may be something better outside. For such a short book, the themes are very well-developed. The narration is great, the pacing and the feeling of suspense well-realized. The ending may be a surprise for some readers or the inevitable conclusion for others, but it is shocking regardless. On to the next installment immediately.

The book ain't terrible, and it was certainly worth the $0 price tag, but I don't understand how anyone could possibly claim it is at the top or anywhere near the top of the post-apocalyptic genre. Maybe my expectations were set too high going into it; if I'd had the experience of finding a diamond in the rough like the first readers of Wool probably felt themselves to have done, I would be more invested in singing its praises. But as it is the popularity of this book is a complete mystery to me. The twist struck me as convoluted and tacked-on. I'll grant that it was somewhat of a surprise (I worked it out before Holston, but not long before), but it just didn't make enough sense to stick with me. A good twist ending should see all the pieces finally falling into place in a way that makes you want to hit yourself for not seeing it all along. This one raised too many questions. Why did the silo society require a view of the outside so desperately if it was such a grim desolate place? Why did they insist that the work of cleaning sensors be done by the banished, when they appeared to have the technology for brief expeditions into the outside world (which without the fake visor images would have only served to further justify their practice of staying in the silo all of the time)? How exactly does the false image of paradise encourage people to clean the sensors? I can imagine that it might have that effect on some people, but it seems really odd that such a ploy would come up in a brain storming session on the issue. Much more effective would be finding some kind of leverage to bring to bear. It wouldn't even have to be a threat: If I was going to be banished into the wasteland either way, I would clean the sensors if I knew, for instance, that my doing so would mean extra rations or improved accommodations for someone I cared about. Better yet-- decriminalize the act of leaving the silo. Make it known that it is likely a death sentence to leave, but make it a decision that can be freely entered into, and which the group will offer support for. Then, when the adventurer is ready to try his luck outside ask whether he would mind doing his community a much needed favor en route. Just a thought. I just can't see how thinking that the silo society is deceiving itself would make a banished person want to clean the sensors. If anything it would seem to have the opposite effect. After all, by cleaning the sensors which display the false wasteland, the banished would be making himself complicit in this deception. If he refused to clean, on the other hand, he would be contributing the eventual black-out of the sensors which might lead people to lose their fear of the outside world and come join him in this paradise. Yup, sorry, I can't get into a series with such a bullshit premise. And don't tell me that this is because it's the first of series. Wool was intended as a standalone so I don't see why I shouldn't evaluate it as such."}, {"userName": "Penny Raspenny", "userReviewDate": "Feb 29, 2012", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/7015013-penny-raspenny", "userReview": "AmazingI'm lost for words...This was good!

A love I might add that we saw from the end. I mean, it was already there when we started reading, we never saw it being born, yet it was not at all less powerful. We were provided with every detail of the emotional state of the MC and the journey that lead him there, all being presented exactly right. The writing was very good and in every step of the way you were taking the path the author wanted you to. Like inception, he planted the idea and you just followed. You never knew more or less than what he wanted you to know. I was carried away actually feeling and thinking whatever he intended for me to feel and think. I applaud!

At 49 pages long, the tale can be read in a single sitting, and more than likely you will do just that, because you will find yourself immediately getting sucked into this one from the first paragraph.In this post apocalyptic world, a remnant of mankind lives in a giant circular silo. (It is never mentioned whether this is an old nuclear missile silo or not, but having spent too many hours watching the television show \u201cDoomsday Preppers\u201d that is how I envisioned this sanctuary.) No one is allowed outside. That is because outside lies quick death by toxic air.Hidden in their small silo, the only view of the outside that these survivors are allowed is a large tv screen fed from several cameras outside. The only problem is that every so often the cameras need to be cleaned. But since no one can go outside and live, it presents somewhat of a dilemma until they come up with a novel solution: send condemned criminals outside to clean the cameras.And Sheriff Holston never questioned this at all until . . . the day his precious wife Allison was sent outside. Ever since, he has wondered if she is really dead? Some part of him longing to believe the outside world is not devastated but habitable. The story of its toxicity just a falsehood to keep them entombed in their concrete and steel coffins. But the only way to be sure is to do the unthinkable: follow her outside!This was one of those stories that lived up to its hype. Hugh Howey penned a clever, inventive story that took a standard post apocalyptic idea and turned it on its head.

There\u2019s a few thousand of them living in this silo that extends about 150 stories beneath the earth and the only glimpse the inhabitants ever get of the barren outside world is through the silo\u2019s cameras. The first part follows Holston who becomes consumed by curiosity about what state the outside world is actually in as he's suspicious about the veracity of these 'cameras'. When he can't take the not knowing any longer, he volunteers for a suicide \u2018cleaning\u2019 mission in order to be sent outside and finally see for himself. The plot took a while to pick up, most of the novella in fact, and the writing was a little long-winded and stilted at points, but I did feel invested in Holston's story and Howey managed to create a certain amount of suspense over the outside world. It was three stars for the majority but then there was that final reveal. Holy shit, that ending was awesome. I will definitely start reading the Omnibus so that I can carry on with the four subsequent stories and see how they (hopefully) answer all the questions raised by this first instalment.

Set in a post-apocalyptic and uninhabitable world where the survivors live in an underground missile silo, criminals are sent outside to clean the sensors and cameras so everyone inside can continue to see what's out there. They are also supposedly sent to their deaths due to the toxic air, but no one really knows because they never come back. It's a wonder they actually complete their cleanings before going off over the hill, but somehow, they always do.Three years ago, Sheriff Holston's wife dug up some things from deleted computer files that led her to believe that they haven't been told the truth about the outside from their leaders, and expressed the one thing that would immediately evict her from their society - her desire to go outside. So, Sheriff Holston watched her leave and hoped she'd return for him as she promised. But, she didn't, and so Sheriff Holston decides it's time for him to follow her.

The kind of fun that only a decent post-apoc and creepy dystopian story can deliver. One of my favorite kinds of literary fun. The set up to the story is simple as the novella is only 59 pages. It is told from the point of view of one character - -both in the present time of the story and through brief flashbacks to three years earlier. I do not want to give anything away; the story is dystopian (taking place in a very limited society after a post-apoc event) so readers can assume there will be a delightful twist at the end.

I've broken down and jumped on the bandwagon, and yes it is brilliantly written. Each sentence is crafted to evoke a specific vision, emotion, and even memory that is embedded in our animal self. We all have the same fears, desires, insecurities, and paranoid thoughts. Somehow Hugh Howey has tapped into all those base elemental DNA, built-in, animal fight or flight, crap that we are all born with and wrapped it all up into a world that would drive even the most \"mellow dude\" to grab an AK47 and go all \" start the revolution NOW\" ! Do any of you really totally trust your government?Being surrounded on all sides by a poisoned world...( yes it's been done to death 1000 times) would drive me out there to kill myself eventually as well, BUT... it hasn't been done quite like this. I think this would be a stellar TV series if done properly, (Id like to see lots of inner dialogue going on), which would make it very unique, in television. But it would have to have one HELL of a budget. HBO are you paying attention?Howey writes with precision. There is not one wasted word or sentence. Each, is there for a reason, to evoke a response. There are some predictable twists, right off the bat, and then...( ahem) a few that are not. This was an epic to read. Man has ruined his planet and sequestered the survivors of an apocalypse in a silo out in nowheresville. Anyone who breaks the rules is sent out in a \"less than securely sealed\" space suit to scrub the windows, and eventually die in the process. So that all who live in the silo can be reminded how poisonous the planet remains, and how \"fortunate\" they are to be safe in their silo. But what most of the general populous don't know is that they are not alone. There are many silos, just out of view of each other, and all with the same problems.There have been \"cleansing\" uprisings every generation or so, but few remember them so they keep happening, like clockwork. Funny how these \"little internal wars\" happen at just the right time to adjust the population, and rid the silos of the curious IT intelligencia who discover the reason for the uprisings, hidden in the computers memories. This story moves from one educated IT worker, to a husband, to a lowly maintenance worker, to a security officer, throughout several levels in the silos hierarchy, all the way out through the poisonous atmosphere to another silo, and it's inhabitants.This is a tightly woven, intricately detailed interesting look at a very possible future. A way to control a certain number of the population in a vertical space that would be a very small footprint on our planet. It keeps the bad stuff out, or it could keep the bad stuff in. A prison any way you look at it.

Despite its length, the story was well paced and very well developed. I've read books that are more than four times as long with less going on than WOOL. The book description does a great job summarizing the plot, so all I\u2019ll say on that end is that the plot is quite unique and keeps you guessing until the end. Besides the story, what I liked the best about WOOL was how immediately familiar such a barren world felt. Living underground is a commonly used theme in post-apocalyptic fiction. However, in WOOL, the author goes one step further to get into the head of the main character and make us feel what he feels: the claustrophobia of living underground, the almost primal urge to feel something real and natural, not man-made. The ending, while I was able to predict what would happen, still came as a shock to the senses. What I will say is that things do not appear as they seem, in more ways than one.

They are so good, one must say as little as one can about them so that you don't ruin it for the new reader. With that, here's my review.The WOOL series of short stories began as a stand alone tale that soon grew to five, well-received short stories that weave a dyspotian tale of human perseverance. Set in the distant future, the world outside is toxic. People live and die beneath the earth in silos. Except for a few whom are tasked with cleaning the exterior monitors, no one goes outside. For to do so is a sure death sentence as nothing can resist the toxic winds that whip a scorched earth.Everyone is not sure why, but when put out to clean, most folks do. Though they have no reason to, they all seem to take the time to clean the monitors, allowing those inside a glimpse of a world they once knew. After cleaning, they inevitably walk a small distance away to die. Their decaying bodies remind all inside what awaits them out there.That is, of course, until one of the cleaners walks away.Set in the near future, the WOOL series is an exploration of humanity and hope as we follow the rise and fall of the inevitable. The story revolves around a mechanical engineer with more sense than luck as she tries to do what is right, the IT head with more on his shoulders than we can imagine, and a whole host of characters than remind us of who we all are. To say more than that would give too much away. I can\u2019t recommend this series enough. The writing is tight, the plot intriguing, and the story of these characters trapped in the underground silos will move you to tears.And hope."}, {"userName": "Lemar", "userReviewDate": "Jul 09, 2017", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/5172572-lemar", "userReview": "A great plot supported by writing that effectively takes you to a future time in its convincing detail.

In the world Hugh Howey creates, people have been forced into underground silos to survive the destruction that's taken place on the surface. Around the silo there are screens that show the world above - brown, dusty, ruined, colorless and lifeless. The reader is drawn quickly into the silo world as former sheriff Holston climbs the metal steps to his execution. As other readers have noted, the description of the silo is spare. (As a reader, I didn't have trouble creating images of it in my mind. I can see how this world could be developed into a full-blown novel!) For three years, Holston has been grieving the death of his wife, Allison. She chose to say the fateful words \"I want to go outside\" - a death sentence. Anyone who says those words are sent outside to clean the lenses but then are eaten away and suffocated by the toxic air. We learn in a flashback that she'd been investigating historical uprisings (one every generation or so) in the old hard drives and computer files. She's investigating who deleted the files and why. Holston asks her, \"You're saying that someone wiped out our history to stop us from repeating it?\" (pg 21). Both Allison and Holston choose the same fate. The ending of the book literally took my breath away. It also gave me some food for thought - in my opinion, the trait of a story that's more than a story.Themes of the book are hope and insanity. Should people hope for a better world? Should people be kept from wanting an alternative?This story also raises questions about the human spirit. How long can it be repressed without something giving way? The title reminds me of the phrase \"pull the wool over your eyes\" which means \"to deceive someone intentionally.\" This is a short book and it's well worth the time you'd spend reading it!"}, {"userName": "Bruce", "userReviewDate": "Nov 04, 2016", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/6309342-bruce", "userReview": "This is a twisted post-apocalyptic world where people live underground in a silo because the surface has somehow been horribly corrupted. Although they have a sheriff and a mayor, the silo is run by a malicious IT department, and the worst thing you can do is ask to go outside. You\u2019ll get your wish. Howey creates an aura of desperation and dread that permeates his writing. You\u2019ll feel the horror of the world and the claustrophobia of the silo, and you\u2019ll want out too. Luckily the characters Howey developed moved me from desperation to hope. It\u2019s not really a character-driven story, but the characters are good. The book read like different stories being pasted together, although they fit together in an ingenious and suspenseful manner. I guess it started out as short stories, and it still has that feel, but with plenty of twists and suspense. The plot still moved me right along and kept me reading. The weakness for me was the writing itself, and too much internal dialog, going over and over the issues at hand. The characters are alone through long swaths of the book, and so they have long internal dialogs with themselves. I found myself skipping over much of it. I think it could be condensed down to a shorter book and it would be much better. Nonetheless, I recommend it. A fun read."}], "description": "Thousands of them have lived underground.
