I just want to bite into that thick, juicy tube o\u2019 meat and let the uniquely succulent flavor of indulgence course through my veins even as it drips greasy trails of superfluous yumminess down my chin. That\u2019s kind of how I feel about thrillers. I don\u2019t read them all the time, but every once in a while, the mood strikes, and I just want\u2014nay, NEED\u2014one. It doesn\u2019t matter that it may be full of clunky expository dialogue or stock characters or logic-defying plot twists; as long as it\u2019s taut and tense and keeps the pages turning, I want it in my literary gullet. And, boy, did I treat Messrs. Preston and Child like a hearty Oscar Mayer Selects Smoked Uncured Angus Beef Frank vis-\u00e0-vis insertion into said gullet. I charred them to perfection, slathered them with ketchup, and just about swallowed them whole.Relic was exactly what I was in the mood for: a dark and mysterious page-turning thriller, one set IN A MUSEUM, no less (I\u2019m hard pressed to think of a more perfect setting)\u2014one that incorporated history and myth in equal measure, and one, due to the date of its publication, that didn\u2019t rely TOO much on new-fangled technology to play deus ex machina (with one notable exception that I shan\u2019t spoil). This is the kind of thriller I especially like\u2014there are nods to character development (even if they don\u2019t necessarily go anywhere), and the central investigative figure\u2014FBI Agent Pendergast\u2014is both entertaining and compelling, a fastidious Holmes archetype with a southern drawl and just the tiniest bit of menace. It was creepy, it was engrossing, it was set IN A MUSEUM (did I mention that? Because that really was a stroke of genius\u2026rooms full of dusty old relics, access to a warren of tunnels underneath New York City, a gathering place for super smart academic types well suited to chasing down clues of both a historical and scientific nature\u2026brilliant)\u2026it was, in short, a worthy read, and I will undoubtedly check out Mr. Pendergast and company\u2019s next adventure. Now, if you\u2019ll excuse me, I need to go wash the fetid goat stink out of my clothes, because there\u2019s a lot of that going on in this story. And it\u2019s kind of gross.

I introduced her to things like epic fantasy she \"introed\" me to things like, well Preston/Child or Koontz). I am surprised not only that I liked it (them) but that I decided to give it 4 stars. This is a surprisingly absorbing read and the Pendergast character while he could have ended up a caricature works very well. You come to know him and like him (even if it would be a lot like being friends with Superman).This book can be enjoyed on several different levels and you can think about it or not pretty much as the mood hits you.So, no spoilers, a threat from the jungle invades the museum.... It turns out to be more than what we might first think of as a threat from the \"natural world\", at least the \"natural world\" we're familiar with. This is a bit of a genre bending title and comes closest to a cross between horror and urban fantasy. I suppose the closest comparison I might make would be with the repairman Jack books. Of course, Jack is a somewhat more believable \"human\" than Pendergast who seems to be a master of all disciplines eastern and western and tough enough to make the incredible Hulk pale (green) if he happened to know what he was up against in the tall painfully thin Special Agent in unrelieved black.Lots of fun, lots of action, pure brain candy. Pretty good book.

Too well adapted, perhaps. There is a population explosion of the successful life forms. Then, suddenly a new species appears out of the blue. It is almost always a predatory creature, a killing machine. It tears through the host population, killing, feeding, multiplying. Slowly at first, then ever faster.\u201d\nThe Amazon has always been an attractive source for exploration for the scientific community. There are so many unknown critters, bugs, fauna, and lost tribes that scientists, regardless of what particular field they are specializing in, will find opportunities to make their career, if they are willing to risk their lives in the deep, dark jungles of Brazil. Even if they survive the poisonous snakes, the flesh eating diseases, and the hostile tribes, there are things, monstrous things, that might find them tasty. Dr. Julian Whittlesey is more than a little annoyed when Crocker disappears into the jungle because he is holding up the expedition, but Crocker, as it turns out, has a very good reason for being missing. \u201dA cloud of fat flies roared and swarmed about the open rib cage. Whittlesey noticed that a severed left arm was lashed to the tree trunk with a fibrous rope, the palm sliced open. A number of spent cartridge casings lay around the body. Then he saw the head. It lay face up under the corpse\u2019s armit, the back of the skull torn away, the cloudy eyes staring upward, the cheeks bulging.Whittlesey had found Crocker.\u201dWhittlesey is going to discover that he is leaving the Amazonian jungle one damn day too late. The crates of specimens from the expedition make their way back to the museum in New York, but the members of the expedition join the ranks of the many missing explorers and scientists who have disappeared in the mountains, the rivers, the jungles, and the deserts of the world. Something has followed the crates back to the United States. When savagely mutilated bodies start showing up in the museum basement, the police and the FBI soon find themselves in a desperate battle with a beast that defies categorization. When a claw is recovered from the body of a victim, the analysis of the DNA is more baffling than helpful. \u201dThe analysis of the claw creates a general caricature of the creature in the question, comprising a primary mix of primate, reptile, and human genes; a nocturnal nature; a strong sense of smell; a quadruped build; a maximum speed of 60-70 KPH; and thick muscle definition and bone structure. Frock describes this hypothetical combination as having the strength of a grizzly bear, the speed of a greyhound, and the intelligence of a human being - the ultimate predator.\u201dDid I say baffling? I meant terrifying!The team of museum staff, Detective Vincent D\u2019Agosta and FBI special agent Aloysius X. L. Pendergast, are in a desperate race to discover what exactly they are chasing in the bowels of the museum, while at the same time trying to convince the powers that be that the gala event to raise funds for the museum will just be providing a buffet for the monster. Further research ties this creature to the Kothoga tribe who worshiped a lizard god called Mbwun--HE WHO WALKS ON ALL FOURS. It is addicted to a plant that produces the same hormones as the hypothalamus in the human brain. Could this be the creature in the bowels of the museum? Could this explain the busted skulls and slashed brains of the victims? The computer programming that was so intrical in determining the type of creature will seem antiquated to many readers now, but since I was using computers in that era, for me it was just a bit of nostalgia. It does not detract from the plot, but it certainly places the situation in historical context. The details about the workings of the museum were also fascinating. One of the authors, Douglas Preston, worked in the American Museum of Natural History in New York for seven years so that experience lends so much authenticity to not only the culture of the museum, but also the characters. Preston also wrote a book called Dinosaurs in the Attic about his time spent working in a museum. Wouldn\u2019t it be great to work in a museum? \nThe movie stars Tom Sizemore and Penelope Ann Miller.There was a movie made of the same name in 1997. It follows the book pretty well, but interesting enough, one of the main key characters in the book is completely erased from the script. Special Agent Pendergast, whose character continues to be developed by the writing team in fifteen more books after Relic, is sliced from the movie storyline. The writers on the movie script expand the role of Detective D\u2019Agosta and keep things simple by eliminating the odd, but very interesting character of Pendergast. I read this book probably fifteen years ago and recently decided that I wanted to read more of the series because I remembered really enjoying this one. It holds up well after all these years, and now I\u2019ve reopened the gateway to read the rest of the series. Memory rebooted. Onward to Reliquary.

What I would like to focus on is what remained with me.I\u2019m sticking to my original rating. This novel is one of the few that my wife and I still discuss on a rather regular basis, even after all this time. Relic ticked quite a few of the right boxes. Such as:(1) Atmospheric setting. In this case, the museum. When night falls, the museum itself becomes a character in the story: creepy as all hell.(2) Interesting protagonist. Even though Aloysius Pendergast was still sharing the lead role(s) with Margo Green and Vincent D\u2019Agosta when Relic was published (he made the series truly his own by book 3: The Cabinet of Curiosities), he is as endearingly eccentric and competent here as he is in any of the later instalments.(3) Creature feature. Ah, I specifically liked this aspect of the novel. In fact, my wife and I were so enamoured with Mbwun, we took to calling our dogs by that name. (4) Scares. Yes, there are plenty of them, courtesy of the synergy of the aforementioned Atmospheric setting and Creature feature, when combined.(5) Twists. I, for one, did not see that coming! Did you?(6) Well researched. You have to give honour where honour is due. Preston and Child go to a lot of trouble to get it right. My wife is a medical doctor and we had some interesting discussions regarding, for example, the function of the hypothalamus and the book\u2019s depiction of forensic autopsy.Expect some horror elements, police procedural elements and a bit of Michael Crichton. I still recommend this novel to everybody I discuss books with. Yes, not everybody likes it, but if you are going to fall for Relic, you\u2019re going to fall big time. In closingYou can\u2019t help but be dumbfounded by Hollywood\u2019s stupendous lack of foresight by leaving Pendergast out of the film.

Not in a bad way, but it was all super-sciencey and talked about a prehistoric creature from the Amazon. The museum setting was fantastic -- it really lent itself to the vibe of claustrophobia which inevitably upped the suspense factor of the book. The characters themselves were fantastic. Smithback stood out and I hope we see him again; I was really annoyed by him at first, but then when everything went to hell and he wound up hiding under a table stuffing his face, I was just like...

This silly book turned out to be one big, over the top, cheesy, load of fun! I enjoyed it quite a bit. I\u2019ve read some reviews where people called The Relic a mystery horror (and I guess in some ways it is) but I tend to look at it as a crazy, disaster, monster film. If you took The Position Adventure, threw in a furry, brain-eating, velociraptor, and then had a total nincompoop in charge of the rescue mission -- that would be this book. Yes it\u2019s that crazy. There are lots of WTF moments. Were the characters one dimensional? Hell, yes! But I grew to be fond of them. D\u2019Agosta is the hard broiled New York city cop just trying to do his job. Smithback is a slimy journalist who turns out to be not such a bad guy. Dr. Frock is the crackpot scientist genius. Pendergast is the amazing (Sherlock Holmes like) FBI Agent who comes from out of nowhere to assist. Wright is the totally self-absorbed director of the museum who cares more about money than human life (he has a couple of cronies that hang out with him.) And Coffey! OMG that guy was hilarious. He gets the Dwayne T Robinson award for being the most obnoxious (I\u2019m in charge of this operation and we don\u2019t need fire exits) stupid asshat. I\u2019m still laughing at that guy!And last but not least there\u2019s Margo Green the doctorial student. She\u2019s pretty boring. I think of her as the token female character that was put in so it wouldn\u2019t be just men. It's a full cast. :DDid I have problems with the book? Yes -- I thought it was too long. The beginning is painfully slow. I think some text could have been cut out to make the story more taut. Maybe it would have been more interesting if there had been real characters with real dialogue, but that wasn\u2019t the case, so it was a bit tedious to read. There's lots of science babble, which is repeated several times, and since the scientific theory is so damn silly anyway, it\u2019s probably kind of superfluous. The ending was great though. I couldn\u2019t set the book down. I wanted to know what was going to happen and find out who was going to get eaten. This book has so many clich\u00e9s, but they are fun clich\u00e9s. I was laughing while I was reading. So if you want to read a disaster, monster book that doesn\u2019t take itself too seriously, I think you would enjoy this.

Set in the massive New York Museum of Natural History, the element of horror around the gruesome and brutal killings has just the right atmospheric tone to make the narrative creepy enough without being too cheesy. The story started with two separate Prologues that allude to the potential source of the mysterious murders in the museum. Introduction of the main characters did slow down the first quarter of the book to a certain extent before the investigation went full swing with the arrival of Agent Pendergast. As far as characterisation goes, it is hard to avoid some form of tropes in this genre, which has an immense amount of published material. Aside from the titular character, we have a resourceful young researcher in training under a distinguished anthropologist and curator, the arrogant and smartass upstart, the disgruntled and outspoken journalist, the hard-bitten and competent lieutenant, and the museum administration who refuses to listen. Oh, and how can I forget the obnoxious FBI agent who struts in and imposes control over a situation which he doesn't understand. Agent Pendergast has sufficiently intrigued me with his Holmes-like persona. A learned and eccentric Southerner with a refined and immaculate poise ever so lightly touched with a threatening presence, his eventual arrival to the museum was when the story becomes way more engaging.This is a well-written book with tight pacing and a pretty clever plot. While I view the story predictable, the suspense and action scenes towards the end of the book are quite intense. There is one thing about this genre, however, which I always find jarring and that is the typical exposition by soliloquy. Regardless, it does not by any measure reduce the entertainment value of the story and I\u2019ll take it as the standard literary device in this genre.More importantly, am I going to continue reading this series?

This was a great mystery/thriller that was raised above the norm by two elements. The first was the inclusion of a very interesting SF/supernatural element into an otherwise straight-forward crime drama. \u00a0This may have had a more positive impact on me since my reading tastes tend to run towards speculative fiction and so the \"X-file\" element was very welcome.\u00a0The second was the character of Aloysius Pendergast, the charming, brilliant, FBI agent with a Southern accent and an open-mind ready to follow the fqcts into the realm of the bizarre if that is where they are pointing (keeping with the X-files analogy, he is like a cross between Scully's practical, skepticism and Mulder's imaginative deduction). I love when a character acts they way you hope they will in a bizarre situation rather than simply saying \"nope, can't be that, let's think of something else\" until they get hit on the head with a sledgehammer clue. Pendergast don't play that way and was on his game throughout the story.\u00a0Briefly, the plot involves...you guessed it...RELICS from a failed and fatal expedition that end up the New York Museum of Natural History. Well, coincidentally (or is it?) only days before a new exhibition is set to open at the museum (called interestingly enough, the \"Superstition\" Exhibit), a series of grisly and bizarre murders takes place and it is up to our group of researchers, historians, curators, cops....and Pendergast to solve the mystery.\u00a0I thought the backstory of the Relics was fascinating and the slow revealing of the central mystery was well done. On the negative side, there were a few characters that were a bit boring and the middle of the book had some slow parts though nothing too bad. The beginning and ending were terrific and Pendergast was compelling whenever he was in the scene (which thankfully was quite a bit).\u00a0Overall, I liked it and will certainly read the next book in the series.

I didn\u2019t know it was based on a book, but I enjoyed its fun monster movie gimmicks set in a conveniently too-dark museum. The past few years I\u2019ve seen mention of these authors, and even had an unread book of theirs donning my shelves, yet I knew nothing about them. I wasn\u2019t sure if they wrote horror, mystery, but knew I\u2019d figure it out eventually. (edited to note \u2013 I still don\u2019t know their genre really \u2013 horror/mystery/thriller??) Now fast forward to this year, after I bought a lot more of their books from a friend, where I was finally spurred on by a group read, where everyone was digging into Relic, and now here we finally are.If you were like me and had seen the movie but not read the book, expect big differences. Murders occur at the New York Museum of Natural History before a major opening exhibit, prompting the arrival of the local detective D\u2019Agosta. When more bodies pop up, enter the FBI agent Pendergast. It slowly becomes clear to the characters that more than a mere man is responsible for these monstrosities. Half the book is mystery trying to figure the culprit; the other half is figuring out how to best the beast and escape with their lives.Despite being a fascinating story, the book does produce dull moments, especially in the first quarter. It keeps picking up, however, and proved to be a surprisingly quick read at 473 pages. The slightly sedate pace worked well to develop the right kind of atmosphere for a creepy tale. The close wraps up the book with a wallop ending I didn\u2019t see coming.I\u2019d heard about what a great character Pendergast is \u2013 and he proved to be all that and more (except my misgivings about big game hunting stories). He takes a while to come on board, but meanwhile detective D\u2019Agosta is an unexpected delight who steals the page-time just as hard. Margo as the main character is serviceable but nothing special.Thanks to the characters we have humor, but thanks to the writers we have a dark book that\u2019s hard to put down. You can almost feel the shadows closing in when reading this one. Tense scenes are riveting, I may have chewed a fingernail or two. The monster is a creepy villain who manages to stay creepy even when he\u2019s not on scene. It\u2019s not particularly bloody, but it\u2019s violent when needed. Mystery is strong as I figured things out slowly along with the other characters. A good thing about intellectual mumbo-jumbo like this is I can\u2019t fully pre-guess what\u2019s going to happen since I can\u2019t fully grasp it in the first place!The ending leaves the book open for a sequel.

Do not judge me too harshly. Although I enjoy reading classic literary novels, and respectable Pulitzer Prize and Booker Prize award-winning books, and challenging books that are taught in Great Literature classes, and informative topical non-fiction - I also am a fan of the Silly Saturday SyFy horror movies! I watch them all day and into the night! (Ok, ok, I look away a lot.) The traditional classic horror scenarios of being trapped and hunted down one by one on a moving train or in a haunted house or in a skyscraper or in an abandoned psychiatric hospital, or lost in a jungle or on an island being chased by a vengeful magical undying monster - ah! Popcorn heaven! Such delightful terrors and thrills! But the number one top horror location has to be....the never-to-be-topped classic Museum of Natural History! OMG! Natural history museums have it all! Sacred artifacts and preserved half-rotted dead things! Secret hallways, alcoves, rooms and dangerous mad mental scientists elbow-deep amidst large medieval manuscripts and maps, and bubbling chemicals! Boxes of Bones! Mummy critters! Shrunken heads! I bet, gentle reader, like me, you LOVE museums of the dead! Of course, they are not called that. 'Natural History' is the 'safe word'. If one is too overt in using words, the room clears out. Think about the difference between 'steak, and 'dead cow meat'. But we know the truth, gentle reader! During the day, natural history museums all seem so respectably academic and culturally thought-provoking, displaying all of those objects so artistically. So educational. But, at night, the truth is revealed in all those glittering glass-eyes of dead creatures in the displays, and in the glass cases of dusty carvings of staring gods and in the lifeless remains of hundreds of dried-up skeletons, skins and thiinnggss! They are looking at you!'Relic' is just such a shivery spooky creepfest! There is much to love in a traditional (well, since the 1970's) horror novel done well, and 'Relic' is done very well! This is the first novel in the FBI detective Aloysius X.L. Pendergast series.I am not going to say anything else about it. No. Not. 'They' might come for me! Monsters always come when you think about them! Or say their name three times! Or look in mirrors at night aloooonnne. Or pick up objects with curses written all over them. Don't you know ANYTHING? Don't be too stupid to live, like young adults in the horror movies!

I just finished Relic and it was mind blowing. The pacing and atmosphere make this an intense read like nothing else. The story is simple & straightforward - in the words of Hudson (Aliens), its a bug hunt. But what a bug hunt. I am still getting over it.I have seen the movie before and it is quite forgettable. The book is way better - in terms of characterization, the dialogues as well as the sense of creeping dread one gets as the book progresses.In conclusion, it is a great read. Go for it.

Still, this was an easy beach read. The plot advances rapidly, as does the body count. I remember the movie when it came out and enjoyed that for what it was. I liked Special Agent Pendergast for whom the series is named. And I liked this enough to give the next book a shot at some stage.

I can't say it's 100% a 4-star book, but it's a great adventure romp, and for the change of pace I bumped it up.Something mysterious is in the NYC museum, it's hunting people, there's lots of blood and magic and murder and I really had fun with the plot. Very B-movie fun. I LOVED the details about the Museum of Natural History, it feels very well researched and made me want to go snoop around the basement of that building next time I'm in NYC!The characters are not that 3-D but I just found out they continue in later books, so I'll definitely be checking it out."}, {"userName": "William", "userReviewDate": "Jan 31, 2016", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/997203-william", "userReview": "I was in the mood for some monster mayhem, and THE RELIC has long been a favorite movie, so I finally got round to the original book, and I'm glad I did.It's a fine example of the genre and reads a bit like an extended monster-of-the-week episode of the X-Files, with some added gore and thrills. The claustrophobic nature of the museum at night is a great venue for the jump scares and the monster itself is well realized, and suitably nasty in its habits.There's an unfortunate sag in the middle 'what are we dealing with here' section, with too many talking heads and point of view characters - the movie did away with that by dropping some characters all together and merging others into each other. But it's a minor quibble in what is a great creature feature that rattles along nicely apart from that.The prose is direct and straightforward, there's little character development, but really, that's not the point of a tale such as this. You're in a museum, at night, locked in with a ravenous beast that will eat your brain. At such times, it's not literary quality that you're thinking about."}, {"userName": "Mark", "userReviewDate": "Oct 16, 2012", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/6755739-mark", "userReview": "I admit honestly having seen the movie first and I liked it in a B-movie monster show. By coincedence I found a 1st edition Hardback at a flea market and decided to buy it to read it on one of my daily traintrip from and to work. And suddenly I found that the writers of this novel were very shortchanged by the movie. However I do hope some folks discovered the writing of messieurs Preston & Child because in my humble opinion they are the current best writers in thriller/adventure/fantastic novel.This book is about a problem in a large New York museum on the brink of opening a new, large & important exhibition. There is murder and the main characters among them the FBI agent Pendergast, Margo Green & Vincent D'Agosta start looking into the problems and a great and exciting mystery gets opened up from its source from the Amazon.This is a book I read in one long go, and it made me seek out the other books by these gentlemen. (Their solo-works have a lesser attraction for me)It started my fandom with these writers and I have all books from their collaboration collected.

I read the book right after the movie came out because I loved the film so much. I found Chuck Palahniuk and Thomas Harris the same way. Fight Club and Silence of the Lambs were both movies I had no idea were originally books. As with most film adaptations, the books were much better. Which brings me to Relic. Not only is the book better than the movie, but it makes the movie look stupid by comparison. Note: I still LOVE the movie, so I don't say that lightly.)What Relic does well is blending the impossible with the possible. Though I'm a layman, Preston and Child come off as if they know what they're doing. They suspended my disbelief with an adept hand. If they made it all up, cool beans. At least it sounded plausible. And please don't comment about how far-fetched the monster or story is. I'm simply saying, I believed in the fiction enough that I could enjoy the story. The review blurb on the front of the book states: \"Far above Crichton's Jurassic Park.\" To me, this is truth, but only because of my literary tastes. Jurassic Park was another movie I watched before seeking out the book. I disliked Crichton's novel,though, feeling the movie was much better. Don't get your knickers twisted, as this is simply my own subjective opinion. Honestly, I probably liked Relic more because of the horror elements, which were handled very well, leaving a great deal to the imagination. What I respect the most about Relic is the ending. Preston and Child manage to maintain tension for well over a hundred pages. I breezed through this book, as every chapter-ending left me wanting to move on. In fact, I think this is the quickest I've ever read a book of this length - 468 pages in only four days. I'm a slow reader. Don't judge me. :PI'm reading the sequel, Reliquary, next. I will review when I'm done.E.(P.S. I forgot to explain why I gave it four stars. The writing is very matter-of-fact and often repetitious, sometimes even banal. Preston and Child have certain words and phrases they love, and you can tell. Oh, and another very minor thing that bothered was that everyone in the book not only had a fondness for saying \"Chrissakes,\" but they also all said it the exact same way. The story, though, makes up a great deal for all the little things I didn't like.)"}], "description": "Just days before a massive exhibition opens at the popular New York Museum of Natural History, visitors are being savagely murdered in the museum's dark hallways and secret rooms.
