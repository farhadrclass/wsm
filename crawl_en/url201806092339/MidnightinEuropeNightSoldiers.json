The Spanish Civil War is going on and times are desperate for the Spanish Republic as Axis troops from Germany and Italy have joined the Francisco Franco Nationalists effort to overthrow the government. Interesting enough the Soviet Union and Mexico are allied with the Spanish Republic. Ferrar has an extended family in France that he is supporting, and so though he wants to go join the fight to protect the Republic it would mean leaving his family impoverished. \nI\u2019ve always liked this shot of Hemingway working as a reporter and gathering material for a book in Spain in 1937.Meanwhile he is enjoying his life in Paris so aptly described by one of his friends. \u201dThe conversation drifted away, to life in Paris and then, as they worked through the second bottle of wine and ordered a third, to nightlife in Paris; nightclubs high and low, and brothels catering to every imaginable inclination\u2026. \u2018The Parisians are worldly in these matters,\u2019 he said. \u2018They believe that with money, all things are possible. They accept the reality of the human appetite, and the reality of markets. Here, one can have whatever one can pay for. I have always admired their point of view.\u2019\u201dFerrar is offered the services of a high class madam who has a stable of aristocratic women indebted to their dressmakers, but he prefers his lovemaking infused with passion.\u201dNo, I like love affairs, a woman\u2019s desire is the best aphrodisiac.\u201dI would give Ferrar a high five if I could walk into the pages of this book, sit down at the table with him, light a Gitanes cigarette (I would most assuredly have smoked in 1937.), and order myself a gentiane. \nGitanes Cigarette Poster from the 1930s.The Spanish Republic is in desperate need of supplies, weapons that can be bought from the Soviets, but must be moved by ship and train through German controlled territory to Spain. (Danzig or Gdansk, a city with an interesting history.) Ferrar is asked to be a broker to help move those much needed weapons to his friends in Spain. His predecessor, a museum director, did not fare well. One of the issues for the Republic is that they don\u2019t have a professional spy organization and so have to recruit amateurs to be those valuable facilitators to keep the war effort alive.\nIconic Robert Capa photo of a Falling Republican Soldier.Ferrar meets people, some working for the cause and some selling information to whoever is willing to pay. I particularly liked the description of Professor Z. \u201dFinding Professor Z was not hard; he was sitting on a bench at the foot of a staircase beneath an ivy-covered pergola, reading a French novel. When he looked up and saw de Lyon, he kept his place in the book with his finger, and there it stayed for the length of the conversation. The professor was wearing a battered old chalk-stripe suit and had the sort of beard worn by men who don\u2019t like to shave but don\u2019t like beards either; a scraggly growth, brown and gray, chopped back when it grew too long. He was smoking a cigarette in a cigarette holder and was, apparently, a chain-smoker--there were more than a few squashed-out butts on the brick cobblestones by his feet.\u201dHaven\u2019t we all been in that position with our finger in a book waiting for someone to stop talking to us? Books always play a part in Alan Furst novels. Ferrar\u2019s girlfriend in New York is a librarian by day and a lurid pulp fiction writer by night. Furst\u2019s characters generally are readers and Ferrar is no exception. When time drags he picks up Robert Byron\u2019s book The Road to Oxiana which is still considered one of the classics of travel writing about the Middle East. Lose yourself for a moment along with Ferrar in Persia in 1933.\u201dThe day\u2019s journey had a wild exhilaration. Up and down the mountains, over the endless flats, we bumped and swooped. The sun flayed us. Great spirals of dust, dancing like demons over the desert, stopped our dashing Chevrolet and choked us. Suddenly, from far across the valley, came the flash of a turquoise jar, bobbing along on a donkey. Its owner walked beside it, clad in a duller blue. And seeing the two lost in that gigantic stony waste, I understood why blue is the Persian colour, and why the Persian word for it means water as well.\u201d\nRobert Byron, a writer who died way too young.Alan Furst has a talent for infusing his atmospheric novels with elegance, sensuality, anxiety, sacrifice, and cleverness. His characters, generally, are common people placed in uncommon circumstances who sometimes have to choose between loyalty or survival. Things go wrong. Sometimes luck is as important as skill. His characters are learning the rules of the game on the fly and the penalty for losing is best not thought about. There is a stylishness that I really appreciate in a Furst novel. He places me back in time, a time that was full of danger and possibilities. A time when a beautiful countess might be the love of your life or she might be the one who tries to kill you. A time when criminals are useful and crimes have new definitions. A time of changing alliances and trust is a difficult commodity to earn. A time when a man might save the world and the world will never know it. I highly recommend his Night Soldiers series. They all work fine as stand alone novels so no need to read them in order. I was first introduced to Furst with The World at Night so I have a soft spot for it. I believe that universally The Polish Officer is considered one of his best. I won\u2019t disagree with that assertion."}, {"userName": "Michael", "userReviewDate": "May 15, 2014", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/4086118-michael", "userReview": "I got a pretty good fix for my addiction to this loosely connected series. Now up to 13 books known as \u201cThe Night Soldiers\u201d collection, they all take place in the last few years before France is invaded (May 1940) and feature relatively ordinary people become extraordinary by getting involved in actions to slow the impeding takeover of Europe by the fascists.. France is usually a setting for much of the action, but the plots spread the narrative to peoples and locations in other countries which vary from book to book (e.g. Poland, Hungary, Bulgaria,the Netherlands, Greece). Here our hero is a Spanish transplant to Paris, Cristi\u00e1n Ferrar, who works for a large international law firm. He gets drawn into an arms supply scheme to help the Republican forces fighting a civil war against the military takeover by Nationalists led by Franco.As a lawyer who frequently travels around Europe for corporate clients, Ferrar is a logical candidate to facilitate financial dealings on arms deals on behalf of the Republic. But France is technically neutral, and an embargo is in place on direct shipments. Shipments through neutral countries often get intercepted. In contrast with Russia\u2019s inadequate efforts to support the Republic, the Nationalists are well supplied by Hitler and his Luftwaffe dominates the skies. Their besieged forces continue to hold big cities like Madrid and Barcelona, but most of the country has been taken. Ferrar wants to help, and the espionage division of the Spanish embassy in Paris encourages him to take on the task of finding a source and directly managing the purchase and shipment of tons of anti-aircraft shells. There are definitely some thrilling parts where Ferrar has to engage criminal elements in his task and orchestrate clandestine activities in Berlin, the Polish port of Danzig (now Gdansk), Istanbul, and Ukraine. German spies work hard to sabotage their schemes, and Ferrar is concerned over whether his new lover, an exiled Spanish marquesa, might be working for them. For those like me are a little fuzzy about the human cost of the Spanish Civil War, I pull this thumbnail sketch from Wikipedia: The war was cast by Republican sympathizers as a struggle between tyranny and democracy, and by Nationalist supporters as between communist and anarchist \"red hordes\" and \"Christian civilization\". Nationalists also claimed they were protecting the establishment and bringing security and direction to an ungoverned and lawless society. \u2026Death totals remain debated. British historian Antony Beevor wrote in his history of the Civil War that Franco's ensuing \"white terror\" resulted in the deaths of 200,000 people and that the \"red terror\" killed 38,000. Julius Ruiz contends that, \"Although the figures remain disputed, a minimum of 37,843 executions were carried out in the Republican zone, with a maximum of 150,000 executions (including 50,000 after the war) in Nationalist Spain\"..As usual, Furst achieves in me as a reader of this book a marvelous sense of presence in this time and place of momentous significance. The prose becomes invisible, and you can\u2019t help but be transported by the atmospherics. I believe Furst\u2019s tales to be quite realistic and not over dramatic or romantic about his favorite theme of citizens from various walks of life moved to become secret soldiers and volunteer spies. People hooked on espionage thrillers will likely be disappointed with the limited scope of the action of Furst\u2019s lead characters. But their plausible heroism still moves me. Unlike le Carr\u00e9\u2019s plots, Furst\u2019s protagonist characters are not in moral torment or struggling with cynical despair, but merely human in their weaknesses, doubts, and vices. You root for them with sadness over their doomed task to stop the forces of darkness and cling to the currents of nostalgia over the lives and culture destined to be swept away in the coming maelstrom.To help prospective readers with their choice I share a couple of quotes that speak to the sense of life in the character of Ferrar and some of his bold creativity in his approach to his efforts. His attempts to garner useful help from the cagey representatives of the Spanish embassy in Paris stimulates this reaction:He had seemed genial and forthcoming, but he was a diplomat and it was his job to seem so. What was the old joke? \u2026\u201dWhen a lady says \u2018no\u2019 he means \u2018maybe.\u2019 When a lady says \u2018maybe\u2019 she means \u2018yes.\u2019 But if a lady says \u2018yes,\u2019 she\u2019s no lady. When a diplomat says \u2018yes\u2019 he means \u2018maybe.\u2019 When a diplomat says \u2018maybe\u2019 he means \u2018no.\u2019 But if a diplomat says \u2018no\u2019 he\u2019s no diplomat.\u201dTo get across the border into Germany, Ferrar and his partner in deception unfolds the following ruse with the security guard:\u201cWhat then will you do in Germany?\u201d\u201cWe are here to take photographs for a special issue, to be called \u2018Nudism in the Reich.\u2019 It is quite popular in Germany we are told.\u201d It was. In an effort to stimulate the national libido, and thus breed more Germans, public nudity had been officially endorsed. Hitler himself, known to be a great prude in all things, had attended a nude ballet in Munich. \u2026\u201cHerr Major?\u201d \u2026\u201dWould you care to have a look? I\u2019ve brought along some recent issues.\u201d \u2026\u201dWould you care to keep those, Herr Major?

Just now the dog is biting Spain, and nobody else in the neighbourhood wants to get bitten, so they look away.\u201d\nBut there are people like Cristi\u00e1n Ferrar, a Spanish lawyer employed by Coudert Fr\u00e8res in Paris, for whom the situation in Spain matters. Consequently he allies himself with a clandestine operation where he assists in the procurement of arms for the Republican forces in Spain.1938 is a difficult time in Europe. The Spanish Civil War is in full swing and war is just around the corner for the rest of Europe. Spies are everywhere and the arms race is on. Ferrar and his oddball companions have to do what they can to find weapons for their cause. The action takes place in various countries, and there are meetings in restaurants where delicious food is consumed, other meetings take place in bars and nightclubs. Here is Ferrar\u2019s observation of one such nightclub where \u201cslumming nouveaux riches, swindlers, spies, prostitutes of the higher order\u201d congregate: \u201cThe scene struck Ferrar as a kind of undersea world. Beneath a placid sea, exotic creatures mated and fed on each other and, as you sank deeper, the world turned darker and the creatures grew strange indeed.\u201d Ferrar is adept at finding the right locale for any business meeting, and he keeps lists in two separate drawers of his desk; one with restaurant names and one to cater for other appetites: \u201cFar easier were requests such as you know Paris, Mr. Ferrar, where shall we eat? So, another list, kept in a different drawer to avoid mortal error, perhaps by a secretary. But Mr. Ferrar, can the bistro really be called domination and whipping? Do they have onion soup?\u201d And so Ferrar might choose \u201cAn elegant restaurant, expensive and not subtle about it. We want our guest to feel honoured and respected, a man we see as a high personage, because we\u2019re going to insult him, by assuming he\u2019s the sort of gent who would take a bribe.\u201dIt doesn\u2019t all take place in restaurants or caf\u00e9s such as the famous Angelina\u2019s (which still exists!) where he indulges in pastries and hot chocolate, but he and his associate Max de Lyon undertake dangerous journeys to Germany, Poland, etc. in their quest for arms for their Spanish Republican comrades and their contacts are not always people that you would like to introduce to your mother.This novel is apparently the thirteenth in the Night Soldiers series.

Here, a lawyer in Paris gets involved in arms smuggling on the Republican side of the Spanish Civil War, and in the course of telling the story, Furst presents as clear an understanding of what that war was about as I have read. All of the bad guys - Germany, Russia and Italy - were getting ready for the bigger war to follow while the French and British dithered.Furst's ability to set a scene - warmly and indelibly - is as good as any author I know. Some authors take paragraphs or even pages to do this; Furst does it, time after time, in a few words. Almost instantly, you are in the setting, seeing and hearing along with the characters, feeling the weather. His scenes of Paris, many of which describe locales I know, are magnificent.The only complaint I have about \"Midnight in Europe\" is that it was, at 250 pages, too short.

I finished it in one day! Now I have to wait two years for his next one! *sigh* Maybe I'll go reread Night Soldiers or Dark Star. That might make me feel better.I've always wondered what the Spanish Civil War was really about. No one could tell me. I knew it was a testing ground for Hitler's new weapons, but that's about it. (So, yeah, maybe I'm a dope, but I wasn't really clear on what World War 1 was about either, until my daughter wrote an 11th grade paper about it.) As he always does, Alan Furst teases apart the tangled threads of the war, explaining and displaying the different sides, then showing you the terrible human cost. Over the course of this brief, intelligent, sexy, and elegantly written novel, it became blindingly clear how this conflict grew into the horrors of World War 2, an extension of the grotesque battle between communism and fascism.Was this Furst at his best? Well...for that you must read the aforementioned Night Soldiers, or Dark Star, and I would also recommend The Polish Officer.

His crisp prose and compelling narratives are spare and go down smooth, but their iciness chills the blood as you realize that his protagonists, often idealistic yet jaded men caught up in the snare of fascism, are about to come up against forces far greater than they expect. He never wastes time filling in backstory. From page one, you're drawn into his masterful tales set in isolated corners of a Europe hovering on the brink of annihilation, populated by spies, black marketeers, gilded dames with secrets, night club owners, and blustering arms dealers. Each novel stands on its own: a piece of an overall devastating picture. Where he excels is in creating lasting glimpses into a vanquished world full of flawed humanity, whose choices are never simple, never easy, and of decisions made in a vacuum of historical forethought. For Furst's people, war is a reality, not an abstraction. Every day is another day to survive. What comes next cannot enter their minds because they never know if the future will ever arrive.In MIDNIGHT IN EUROPE, it's 1937 and Christian Ferrar, a Spanish refugee lawyer living in uneasy Paris with his family, all of whom have fled Spain, is approached by a branch of an office dedicated to ensuring Republican victory in his civil-war torn country. Hitler growls in the distance, his shadow already looming over Europe, and Spain has become a bone of contention, with a non-intervention pact that has allowed Franco's Nationalists free rein. The Republicans' last desperate stand depends on munitions, and Ferrar is asked to assist in the secretive negotiations. Abetted by a Jewish spy / jack of all trades, Ferrar plunges into the murky underworld of arms dealers and Russian subterfuge, while entertaining a marquesa of dubious motivations who needs his legal counsel. Ferrar is a classic Furst hero: not a fighter by nature, but rather a man of good taste and reserve, who can see which way the wind is blowing and hopes to sidestep the impending chaos. But he's also loyal to the ideals of freedom in a time overcome by fascist nationalism, and his journey entails him shedding pieces of himself along the way as he struggles to defend a doomed cause.The book is deceptively slim and moves at a rapid pace. Furst depicts Paris in all her finery and seediness, a city of elegance and bistros, and back-alley night clubs where shady dealings are par of the course. The jack of all trades, de Lyon, is a wonderful character: wry, unimpressed by humanity's capacity for betrayal, and dedicated to preserving himself while abetting the battle against fascist ideology. While Ferrar is the hero, de Lyon is the heart. Together, they manage to pull off a seemingly impossible feat, with harrowing scenes set in Nazi Berlin, but the price is, as ever in a Furst novel, too high.The ending too, as always, is a fading, sepia-tinted scene. We never know what will come next, like the people themselves. And that's what makes these novels so addictive. Furst doesn't pander to our sentimental need for stories wrapped in tidy bows. What he offers us instead is a cold drink of reality; and when the glass breaks, its jagged pieces are ours to make of as we will."}, {"userName": "Emily", "userReviewDate": "Jun 18, 2014", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/1889783-emily", "userReview": "What is there left to say about Alan Furst? This novel was not better than the others, nor as good, but I can't call it appreciably worse. Some reviews have said Furst phoned this one in, which I don't agree with, but I think they put their fingers on something lackluster in this book, which I'm more willing to pin on its focus on the Spanish Civil War. That conflict is more complex and less familiar and it's not going to be as easy to use its events and outcome to loom over the story. I did find the main female character in this story particularly frustrating; she gets written out of the story barely ten pages after she is given a backstory and motivation. Above all, I really wish Furst would try something new. I'll even provide some free ideas in ascending order of difficulty. He should write a book about a protagonist with a wife or family that he is close to, and who are involved and at risk in the spying. (I think he's written some men with families, but they still operated day-to-day like lone wolves. That gives the novels a certain freedom and style, but significantly contributes to their interchangeability.) Or, he should write a book that takes place during the war. Better yet, after the war, since the machinations and choosing of sides at the end must have been just as complicated as at the beginning. Or, he should write a book about a woman, a real woman and not one of the walk-on vixens he usually does. The female protagonist should have her own motives and an actual emotional life that goes beyond adventure and lust. She can't just be the usual male character with breasts, but I can't specify exactly what such a character should be like, because that's the author's job.Review copy received from Edelweiss."}, {"userName": "Jim Loter", "userReviewDate": "Jul 04, 2014", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/2436192-jim-loter", "userReview": "Less an espionage thriller and more of a procurement procedural, Furst's latest in the \"Night Soldiers\" series is downhill even from \"Mission to Paris,\" which I felt was already a marked decline from his earlier novels.In \"Midnight in Europe\" we focus on Cristi\u00e1n Ferrar, a Spanish lawyer living in Paris, who becomes involved in an effort to smuggle arms and ammunition to the republicans in his home country. There is very little tension as Ferrar rather openly pursues his aims, announcing his mission to virtually everyone he come into contact with. The only real tension occurs near the end in a marine encounter that feels tacked on.The novel gets off to a good start with a sort of \"cold open\" involving a courier named Castillo who is questioned and ultimately executed by sinister Spanish Nationalists. It's only a few pages long, but it's a well-crafted set-piece that nicely introduces the conditions in Spain during the Spanish Civil War. We never experience those (or any) terrifying conditions again. Furst's novels focus on the Everyman spy - the reluctant do-gooder who is persuaded to take extraordinary risks on matters of principle, justice, and patriotism. This really only works when the protagonist actually has to make sacrifices. Ferrar is barely inconvenienced by his covert work and never directly faces any real danger. He operates from Paris in comparative safety and comfort. He has meetings at night clubs, openly travels throughout Europe, visits his family, has an affair with a Marquesa, conducts business while horseback riding, flies to New York and buys an apartment for his relatives to escape to, and dines at the Brasserie Heininger, the location of Furst's favorite leitmotif - a bullet-hole-ridden mirror above Table #14. All in all, Ferrar seems to be having a pretty swell time while conducting an illegal arms deal more-or-less in his spare time. With nothing really at stake, it's hard to care whether the arms-running plot succeeds - and even if it does, we all know how the Spanish Civil War plays out. What we really need in these kinds of novels is for the protagonist to undergo some kind of personal transformation or overcome some kind of inner war for which the events unfolding in Europe are merely the backdrop and/or a metaphor. Sadly, Ferrar has no personal arc, struggles with no inner conflict, and experiences no growth. What appears to be a story about a man trying to get a big gun from Russia to Spain turns out to be just a story about getting a big gun from Russia to Spain."}, {"userName": "Abby", "userReviewDate": "Aug 31, 2014", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/6843326-abby", "userReview": "Either Alan Furst has lost a step or I've read too many of his books and they're starting to seem interchangeable.

Max de Lyon, not the protagonist, brings a spark when he appears; the reader knows he will have a plan, an idea, something. There is even a time sequence mistake. And don\u2019t even get me started on the dull ending. My husband didn\u2019t even get halfway through the book and we have both read all of Mr. Furst\u2019s books and even went to see him at a Manhattan a presentation. We are fans. Therefore, it pains me to say that since \"Mission to Paris,\" his previous book, he's lost his magic. I hope Mr. Furst takes a year off and recharges his source of inspiration."}, {"userName": "Tony", "userReviewDate": "Jun 19, 2014", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/1361000-tony", "userReview": "MIDNIGHT IN EUROPE. (2012). Alan Furst. ***.Furst was not up to his usual high standard with this novel. It is more of an outline of potential characters thrown at a potential crisis that he could dip into in the future. His main character is Cristian Ferrar, an attorney for a global partnership dealing in international affairs. He has offices, seemingly, in most countries of Europe. The period is the late 1930s. The Spanish Civil War is raging. Franco is sure to win since the Republicans cannot obtain the weapons they need to combat his troops. The only country that will sell weapons to them is Russia. Most all of the rest of the world has gotten together and agreed not to ship weapons to them. Ferrar thinks he can make a difference, and volunteers to help grease the skids so that weapons can get into the country into the right hands. He has no experience in weapons trading, and doesn\u2019t know any of the players. He is helped along the way by a series of shady characters who all contribute their particular skills. The problem, however, is that these individuals have no official standings either. They are all drawn with a sharp pen, but are not ever developed. By the end of the book, I was wondering what kind of cockamamie story this was. I got the feeling that Furst submitted this novel in response to a time commitment. It is not part of his best work."}, {"userName": "Joe", "userReviewDate": "Jun 09, 2014", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/25882000-joe", "userReview": "Furst\u2019s books are billed as World War II historical thrillers. The \u201cthriller\u201d label is a bit of a stretch, which is not a knock. (And Furst\u2019s books are usually set just before or early in the war.) His books are character driven, rather than being one heart thumping chase scene or shoot-out after another. Furst\u2019s protagonists are not your stereotypical war heroes. They fight off the battlefield and on the fringe of the war, battling Nazi Germany/tyranny/evil one day at a time, against incredible odds and staying just one step ahead of apprehension. There are plenty of clandestine meetings, train travel, atmosphere, cigarette smoke, fine dining and romance. All very enchanting, but \u2013 and echoing previous reviews - this Furst template/formula is tiptoeing right up to becoming paint by the number repetitive and vanilla dull.In this novel our hero, Cristian Ferrar, Spanish born \u2013 living in Paris, is an attorney working for a French law firm with international clients and connections. Thus he\u2019s perfectly positioned as he \u201ceffortlessly\u201d slips into his new endeavor \u2013 weapons smuggling; Cristian supporting/supplying his homeland\u2019s Republican government against fascism and Franco. This \u201ceffortlessness\u201d that permeates the book is both the good news and the bad news. On the positive side Furst\u2019s evocative descriptions of time and place \u2013 as we\u2019ve come to expect - are excellent. On the other hand, the plotting, even the story itself, lacks any real tension or suspense; challenges/problems encountered along the way \u2013 all are solved simply and efficiently within pages \u2013 and then it\u2019s on to the next adventure. (Cristian also \u201cfalls in love\u201d several times \u2013 which at times gets a tad Harlequin romance-ish.) Midnight In Europe is an okay and quick \u201cread\u201d, but without the depth and nuance of the author\u2019s earlier novels."}, {"userName": "Thelma Adams", "userReviewDate": "Jun 11, 2014", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/3606770-thelma-adams", "userReview": "Has Alan Furst spoiled me for Alan Furst? He remains one of my favorite authors of historical espionage. I pre-buy every new volume, although his last book, \"Mission to Paris,\" about a Hollywood actor spying in Europe was the least satisfying. In \"Midnight in Europe,\" the research is impeccable. The prose pristine. The psychological insight astute. The women characters intrigue; the protagonist wise and complicated.Again we have a chapter from the WWII playbook, a slice that evokes the whole: a sophisticated Spanish-born lawyer living in Paris moonlights in the arms trade in service of the Spanish Republic in 1938. While we know that Franco's fascists won this battle, and that the Nazi's will rise even further in the coming years, Furst builds suspense in the way that small acts of courage build to impact large strategic movements -- or fall by the wayside in futility.Still, the romantic underpinnings of this particular volume -- between the lawyer and a mysterious Marquesa, and a Manhattan library worker -- seems particularly forced, as if even Furst had tired of creating these couplings. And that could be because I know Furst too well, and found this book a less compelling read than \"The Polish Officer,\" \"Red Gold,\" or \"Night Soldiers.\" Maybe I am ready for Furst to reach back to his Eric Ambler roots and go darker, quirkier, even as his elegant novels gain wider recognition within the literary mainstream."}, {"userName": "Terri", "userReviewDate": "May 14, 2014", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/5963725-terri", "userReview": "Review also found at http://kristineandterri.blogspot.ca/I received an advanced copy of this book from the publisher Random House via Edelweiss in exchange for an honest review.

A spy novel with numerous dangerous and sketchy plots in an effort to assist a war effort. Check. Well written and easy to understand. Check. An interesting venture in to a volatile time in world history. Check.Based on this you would think that I would give it a glowing review. Somehow I cannot. There was just something missing in this story for me and I am not sure I can pinpoint what it was. The characters did not interest me enough to become fully invested and therefore I did feel part of the story as I do with a truly outstanding read. I found the story dull at many times and that in spite of everything that occurred, nothing really happened.I will caution anyone who may read my review that just because I am not doing cartwheels over this story does not mean that I do not recommend it.

Still though I've read and listened to some that were really good and so it isn't a genre I'd deliberately exclude. Plus I do enjoy the historical aspect of them. This book was chosen, like a lot of my audiobook selections, based on the library availability, but it sounds interesting enough. It was in fact, but just barely so. Something about this tale of international agents struggling to get weapons for the Spanish republic army in 1938, specifically one agent, Ferrar and those who help or deter him, just fell flat. The international settings were fun, Europe on the brink of WWII was a sufficiently dramatic backdrop and yet the entire thing felt distinctly disjointed and unengaging somehow.

This one has much of the great sense of place and time, pre-WWII Europe, which are Mr. Furst's strengths. With that said, MIE continues some recent trends in his work which to me, at least, are not positive. First, the mood and menace of his early novels is virtually non-existent here. Yes, there are some close calls, and some risky missions undertaken, but the overall effect is rather light. Second, the protagonist is a well-to-do lawyer in Paris, whose involvement in risky business is pasted on to that of those who are really doing the hard work. One never feels that he has real skin in the game; he's more of a dilettante. By contrast, most of Mr. Furst's early protagonists were relatively ordinary citizens sucked into the Nazi-dominated vortex in pre-war Europe. They were frightened, driven and only a step ahead of capture or worse. This was exciting. Next, the plot involves individuals working in service of the Republican side in the Spanish Civil War. While this is interesting, it's not gripping, at least not in the same way that living in minute-to-minute fear of the Nazis is gripping. Finally, it seems to me that Mr. Furst, for whatever reason, is spending more time and effort introducing romantic involvements (three in MIE) into his stories. I don't know why. All of them, save possibly one, were gratuitous and didn't advance the plot. Plus, writing romance and sex is not his forte. It's probably too much to expect continued, much less annual, high quality novels from Mr. Furst. He's written so many, and it must be hard for him to stop when things are going so well for him. I would never begrudge him his success; it's well-earned. Still, books like this are disappointing. I guess we just have to be thankful for his earlier work."}, {"userName": "Cathy", "userReviewDate": "May 09, 2014", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/1257747-cathy", "userReview": "*ARC*This is the first Alan Furst book I have read, and I loved it. The plot is so subtle you almost miss it. The gentle storytelling and personal details make the reader feel like they are sitting next to Cristi\u00e1n listening to him tell about his day in the office. When he is finished you think, WOW, that was amazing. The nonchalant way the action happens draws you in and keeps you reading even though you know you need to put the book down and go to bed. This isn't one of those spy novels that is packed with non-stop action and leaves you worn out when you turn the last page, it is a beautiful story of a man pulled into a war and does what he needs to do.

There\u2019s just something about the way he sets a scene that has me hooked by the end of the first paragraph. And I don\u2019t come up for air until I\u2019m done. It\u2019s as if I was a spy in the 1930s, or wished I was.Midnight in Europe, while maybe not one of his best, ticks off all the boxes of a classic Furst novel: diverse characters facing tough decisions, gritty locales, historical context, sex, even pacing, and a brilliant portrayal of prewar Paris.What I LikedThe premise\u200a\u2014\u200acouple of Spaniards trying to procure illegal arms for the Spanish Republic in the 1930s\u200a\u2014\u200ais fascinating. You can\u2019t help but feel for the two as they get jerked around by pretty much everyone they encounter.The protagonist, Ferrar, was a lot more interesting than the movie star in Mission to Paris. The grittier the main character, it seems, the more interesting the story.Furst makes everything seem so plausible. You finish the book thinking \u201cYeah, that really could\u2019ve happened like that.\u201d There never seems to be a need for sensationalism.What I Didn\u2019t LikeIt was too short. I remember feeling this way about Martin Cruz Smith\u2019s books after Gorky Park. The writing was so good that I didn\u2019t want it to stop.Having read all of the books in the Night Soldiers series, the descriptions of the Brasserie Heininger do get redundant. It\u2019s featured in every book, so you know the story is going there at some point.RecommendationNight Soldiers (the first in the Night Soldiers series) is one of my top 3 favourite books. I can\u2019t recommend it enough if you have an interest in espionage during the first half of the 20th century. Midnight in Europe doesn\u2019t quite reach that level, but it does make a great intro to Furst\u2019s style."}, {"userName": "Nancy", "userReviewDate": "Mar 10, 2018", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/1690005-nancy", "userReview": "Set in Paris in the run-up to World War II, Furst offers a good spy novel which is one of the few I have seen that is easy to follow.

An emigre from Spain, he inadvertently becomes embroiled in working for a secret agency which is trying to supply weapons to Spain's army where war has already broken out.

Alan Furst plainly doesn't think so and to be fair, he continues to entertain. Furst's combination of a fine eye for detail, unexpectedly sharp sense of humor, and ability to conjure the past has helped make his long series of novels a success. That said, it isn't so much the period as the plot which seems to be growing repetitive. With few exceptions, his heroes are all strong men (and they're always men), with a well developed sense of honor, a penchant for heroics, and a habit of getting in over their heads. The women they love are always mysterious and have some secret that the reader eventually discovers. Yet it is a testament to Furst's skill as as a writer that, even if these plots get tired, they never get completely old.\"Midnight in Europe\" follows all the classic Furst tropes and comes through as an engaging even at times exiting read. Our hero is a Spaniard, an international lawyer named Ferrer, who lives in Paris and gets caught up in the savagery of the Spanish Civil War. WWII receives lots of attention, but too many are ignorant about the Spanish Civil War. While Furst isn't writing a history book, he does give a taste of that bloody, byzantine conflict which will serve as a good education to many readers. As is usually the case, Furst also gives up lots of characters - real and fictitious -- as well as scenes in cities across Europe.In the end, however, Furst wraps up the novel a bit too tightly and several subplots just fall away, serving more as false leads than actual parts of the story. While \"Midnight\" doesn't equal the best of Furst's novels -- I'm partial to \"The Polish Officer\" and \"The Spies of Warsaw\" -- it does deliver an engaging read."}, {"userName": "Charles Vella", "userReviewDate": "Jul 31, 2015", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/18302569-charles-vella", "userReview": "I am a big Alan Furst fan. He writes about an interesting place and time and generally comes up with a pretty interesting cast of characters who often find themselves in pretty tough positions. Occasionally his books seem to meander to an end without anything being resolved, but given that is how real life works I've never been bothered by that. I bought this book as a gift for my wife, who is also an Alan Furst fan. I picked it up and noticed she'd started reading it and set it aside. She couldn't remember why, so I read it myself.By the end of the first twenty pages or so I had a pretty good idea why she'd set down. I kept going. It wasn't exactly a chore, the prose was good, as always. I finished it relatively quickly, it isn't that long, and when I set it down I told her what I have to tell you, I can't really recommend it.As I said, the prose is good, but that is all I can really say positive about it. The setting is Paris, where many of Furst's novels are set, but this one seems to be missing the atmosphere that his other novels have. The main character, a successful lawyer, is dull. He gets involved with the Spanish Civil War, steals a train in Poland, and is shot at by an Italian patrol boat, but never seems to be in any real danger. Nothing much happens to him and there's almost a complete lack of dramatic tension.I have an almost complete set of Alan Furst's novels, and have read many of them multiple times.

The book's central character is Cristian Ferrer, an attorney with a well known law firm with offices both in Paris and New York. They are sympathetic to anti fascist causes. Ferrar's boss flew in WWI. Ferrar's family fled Spain when the civil war began. He is the only breadwinner for the family which consists of his father whose main purpose in life is to track down rare stamps, his mother, his religious sister and his Abuela (grandmother) who really runs the household and is the only one, other than Cristian, who is grounded in reality. Cristian is approached by a member of the Spanish Republican government to assist with arms shipments to Spanish soldiers. It's all but impossible for the Spanish Republic to get the arms they need thanks to British and American laws, but apparently Franco gets everything he needs from his fellow Fascist.
