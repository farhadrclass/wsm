I am completely sad and heartbroken about the last chapter. Mr. Brown has definitely written a series that in my opinion is one of the best I have read. The world he has created is realistic and I find myself asking what would I do if faced with the problems and situations that Steve, Kevin, Juan, Jody and the rest are faced with. I'm very much enjoying the story of Vix. I can't wait to see what is in store for her and Gemma. It's nice to see a woman as a \"hero.\" Between Mackenzie and Emily and even Shari I had some pretty heavy emotions. I simply can't wait til may for the next book. I found myself not wanting to finish this because I was scared of the outcomes for some of our characters. But as I have stated in one of my other reviews, you find that no one is safe in Mr Brown's world."}, {"userName": "Vix", "userReviewDate": "Oct 10, 2013", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/7521915-vix", "userReview": "So now we are getting down to the real issues of survival... its not the zombies we need to watch out for.This series has taken on a whole new level of terror - human nature.. as if Garret & Shaw werent bad enough...The new groups bring a great global element to the story line.As each group is now struggling with its own demons, the story moves along and yet again another round of deaths, shudder.I do wonder who Mr Brown functions on a day to day level with all this yuck pouring out of him... and yet he appears to be the sweetest man possible (pls note he is an AWESOME fan of fans!!)"}, {"userName": "Hammy", "userReviewDate": "Oct 09, 2015", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/45873280-hammy", "userReview": "great read great series."}, {"userName": "AudioBookReviewer", "userReviewDate": "Aug 10, 2015", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/7365795-audiobookreviewer", "userReview": "ABR's original Siege & Survival audiobook review and many others can be found at Audiobook Reviewer.First thoughts about the cover of Dead Siege & Survival by TW Brown? Zombies children! The zombie children are creepy and very eerie. I absolutely love the feel and flavor of both innocence and horror they portray. The shot up vehicles in the background and the random shambling zombies give the over all flow an even creepier vibe.There seems to be a few main characters in this story. They alternate every third chapter. My favorite is Vix Kirkpatrick in this story. I love that she\u2019s sassy and not afraid to say what she\u2019s thinking. It\u2019s also a plus that this \u2018character\u2019 has read lots of zombie stories so she is ahead of the game on staying alive.I greatly enjoy this author and this series. This books would be a little hard to get into the storyline if you picked this book up without reading the other four first though. Not that it couldn\u2019t stand alone, it could. But there is so much back story already filled in with the first four that the reader would loose if he/she didn\u2019t read the others before this one. An example being Steve\u2019s story and how he became the leader of his group. Or Kevin and how he came to be out on a run for medications during the winter when his camp/group was overtaken by Wanda Bears.The Narrator is Andrew McFerrin. This is one of my favorite narrators. I absolutely love the way he reads a story. His accents for different characters definitely have their own accents and they do not blend together. That\u2019s always a plus when you\u2019re getting into a story. This book is Dead: Siege & Survival from the Dead Series, Book 5 by TW Brown. The length of this story is twelve hours and fifty minutes.Warning \u2013 This story does have some gory and bloody scenes. Would not recommend for anyone under the age of sixteen.This story left me wondering about the lengths people will go for family and friends. How much loyalty can be bought or be taken by brute force? Is that actual loyalty, or is it greed and fear? At what point do people stop caring about what they can get from a situation, about the consequences from their actions, if they stop being \u2018loyal\u2019 to those that bought their loyalty by hook or crook?Audiobook provided for review by the production company."}, {"userName": "Sonja", "userReviewDate": "Jan 02, 2013", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/8927384-sonja", "userReview": "I had waited for this book so long and was so happy to see it finally that I bought it. If you have started reading the \"Dead\" series, keep it in the order it was written, or else you will get pretty confused.I loved the book, because it is all about the people you meet, not so much about the zombies.SPOILER....SPOILER....SPOILER....SPOILER....SPOILER....SPOILER....SPOILER...=====Spoiler alert! Do not read if you do not want to know who dies!====I was heartbroken that Emily will not make it, but of course the group could not have had a \"safe honeymoon\" time up in the mountains. I am still curious where the Egyptian story line will lead, and I am not unhappy that \"Slider\" had to go. Overall, I liked this installment a lot again. What is going to happen in London? And will Kevin and his crew hook up with the group that Willa was a part of?And again, I have to wait till the next installment comes out. I know one of the author's inspirations has been Stephen King, so I guess the only thing I wish for is that the next installment will be a Stephen King like 500 pages book! *lol*"}, {"userName": "Ang", "userReviewDate": "May 14, 2013", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/6333656-ang", "userReview": "Ok let me start by saying I am loving this series! Mr. Brown has captivated me with these lives of the living and the dead. The first four books had me heart broken, surprised by out comes, and riveted for the next story! Apparently we need to expect the unexpected with this author. Which is a refreshing change. I have been appalled at the unfortunate but what could very possibly be a very true outlook on what we as humans are more or should I say less than capable of doing. What I am truly seeing in these books is a very real scenario of what could happen with humanity and the way we think and feel. You are put in these very real situations and are left thinking what if?.....Again Mr. Brown has gone above and beyond. I can't even begin to say which of these books is my favorite. I can't even say they get better and better because they have all been excellent. I can not wait for the next book!"}, {"userName": "Jessie", "userReviewDate": "Jan 30, 2013", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/3797768-jessie", "userReview": "I have very much enjoyed reading this series. It is very well written and I love most of the characters. The story is great and really makes you think. I have read in other reviews that no one is safe in this book series but I really hope that Brown slows down on killing off the main characters. There comes a point that the risk isn't worth the gain. Or at least that's my opinion."}, {"userName": "Dawn", "userReviewDate": "Dec 23, 2012", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/7502955-dawn", "userReview": "I cried.

Why? Because one of the things I enjoyed most about the series is that people (ok the 'good people' at least) made rational, reasonable decisions. That trend has been significantly abandoned. Worse yet it feels forced, like it has been done to simply generate the drama and challenges the bad decisions create. It's still an interesting read and doesn't fall into simple silliness but it could have been much better. I hope the next book elevates itself back to the prior levels."}, {"userName": "Rhonda", "userReviewDate": "May 22, 2013", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/7402836-rhonda", "userReview": "Wow. I read this in March 2013 and just finished with the audio version. Even though it wasn't new to me, this book still had a powerful impact and I'm still processing all the emotions Mr. Brown wrung out of me. This is such a great series. The stories and characters are so realistic that I can't help crying at times over the loss of some characters, yet still rooting for others to overcome and survive in a world where zombies are not the only threat."}, {"userName": "Lucas Darathy", "userReviewDate": "Jan 06, 2015", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/27597430-lucas-darathy", "userReview": "Boring Kevin.
