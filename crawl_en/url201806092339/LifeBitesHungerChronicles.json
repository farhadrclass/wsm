Really, really liked this book! It was not the typical zombie apocalypse type of world, and I loved that! The main character, Eva, is one tough cookie. If I ever have to deal with a zombie situation, she is who I want to have with me. She is equipped with just about everything you would want to have when the un-dead take over. However, she doesn't really fit in anywhere, so she is pretty much a loner. In Life Bites, you see some of her past and her present. They are seamlessly blended together, and you soon find out why she keeps to herself. I really appreciated the way Tes Hilaire transitioned between the different times of Eva's life because it is not always an easy thing to do. Sometimes all of the \"time-travelling\" within a book can get confusing. I DID NOT have that problem here. It was also nice to experience this world from Eva's perspective. I found her to be a very interesting character, and you get to learn a lot about her in the book. Her sarcasm and people skills were so entertaining! It was very easy to get sucked into her story and the challenges she is facing. The supporting characters are great too! You do learn quite a bit about John in this book, and he has an interesting story too. I can't wait for more in this series because I'd like to learn more about some of the others as well. Oh, and not to mention the information that was obtained towards the end of the book! The anticipation of what comes next is killing me! Great book!"}, {"userName": "Gaele", "userReviewDate": "Jul 16, 2013", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/9146116-gaele", "userReview": "I will admit to not being the world\u2019s largest zombie / apocalyptic reader. What drew me to this title was the mixture of a vampire and a virus that has endangered them, and the main character seemed to be the sort of smart, snarky, geeky girl that I prefer for my heroines. Hilaire did not disappoint: not only was Eva incredibly clever and very well developed as a vegan now forced to obtain food from \u201cthings with faces\u201d, she developed a world that was unique in premise with enough familiarity to be comfortable for readers. Mixing the events in time provided good insight into Eva\u2019s essential nature and self-reliance, and was done with such flair that it was easy to follow and provide layers of information that would not have fallen into place as well as in a straight narrative Secondary characters are well presented with interactions feeling quite normal, if one can say that about a zombie apocalypse, and the intrigue surrounding John presents potential for some interesting twists in the next instalment. There are some good twists in this book, with enough information to lead seamlessly into the second in the story without the frustration of a large cliff hanger. This was a fun book to read, and the perfect one to wet my feet with a longer zombie story, and a good read for YA and Adult readers alike. I received an eBook from the author for purpose of honest review. I was not compensated for this review: all conclusions are my own responsibility."}, {"userName": "Su Halfwerk", "userReviewDate": "Mar 29, 2014", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/4139695-su-halfwerk", "userReview": "I bought this book after reading The Hunger Chronicles: A collection of shorts and didn't regret the purchase. Life Bites is Eva's story, a teenager who lives in a world filled with zombies and some other creatures. You'll see this world through her eyes and will learn how she became equipped to survive it. A very creative and adept take on that new world.Although Eva thinks she's a loner who's worried only about herself, there are situations that show us that she's the opposite. The layers of Eva's personality are peeled one by one until we see a teenager who learnt to survive against all odds only to discover that she wanted to belong.Really loved the book and can't recommend it enough.Zombies, when you see Eva coming, run the other way\u2026if you can."}, {"userName": "Linda", "userReviewDate": "Aug 25, 2013", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/7638295-linda", "userReview": "I have read the author's paranormal romance and really enjoyed them. So, I decided to check to see if she had anything else out and found this and a book of shorts. I'm glad I did.A bit of a departure from her Paladin series, this book is slanted to the YA urban fantasy market. Our heroine is a vegetarian teen, turned blood craving vampire by her too-good-to-be-true date for the prom. Eva is running from her maker and his sadistic, mommy-dearest, vampire queen who is none too happy with the girl her son brought home. When we meet her she has joined up with what's left of the military in the fight against the z-virus. Eva is an endearing mix of kick-ass and vulnerability and her supporting cast is interesting also. This story is a winner. Enjoy!"}, {"userName": "Steyo", "userReviewDate": "May 06, 2015", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/42817322-steyo", "userReview": "Loved this book. Something different and new.
