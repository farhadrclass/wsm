I was fortunate enough to read Callis Rose before release. I have to say that there is a roller coaster of emotions that flow through these pages. If you are expecting the tongue-in-cheek humor of Talbot or the engrossingly cute Riley, you need to set that aside and allow Mark to show you yet another aspect of his talent.There are some elements here that will be reminiscent of Stephen King's \"Carrie\" but it goes beyond that. One of the real beauties of this story is that, by the end, you really do not know who to \"cheer\" for. I avoid spoilers in my reviews because I believe that the reader should have the pleasure of that discovery. What I will say is that Tufo manages to make you feel sympathy for the \"villains\" and almost root against the main protagonist. That is a credit to his talent and the reason he sits where he does in the Top Horror writers on Amazon.There were some moments where I wanted to think that he dropped the ball, but every twist and turn proves to have a reason. Set aside all that you thought you knew about Mark Tufo and read this book."}, {"userName": "Lady of the Lake", "userReviewDate": "Jul 01, 2014", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/1332853-lady-of-the-lake", "userReview": "I really liked this book. But much of that had to do with that I listened to the audiobook form of it. The narrator, Sean Runnette did a very good job with the tone of the story and did much to help make the characters play out the way I think the author had wanted. I don't want to add any spoilers to my review I had wanted it to turn out a little differently. I did have compassion for the main character. What was going on started out of her control. I would like there to be a sequel to this as there is something I would like to see be a continuation. But can't say anymore without spoiling things. I highly recommend the audiobook over the print/ebook version. The narrator Sean Runnette was before this book on the bottom rung of favorite narrators for me. I never liked his voice and the certain speech impediment he has that always drove me crazy when I would listen to him I always avoided books with him as narrator. But after the first half hour into Callis Rose I got used to his voice and was happy how he read and his portrayal of the characters. It really made all the difference for this book. So if you're interested in paranormal things, astral projection may be part of an explanation... Get the audiobook."}, {"userName": "Jeanne", "userReviewDate": "Jan 29, 2013", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/8559735-jeanne", "userReview": "I had no idea what this book was going to be about, and as I read the first few chapters, it reminded me of the writing style of The Spirit Clearing. At first I thought this was going to be a short story, but the writer is just filling in the background in a short story mode. Once the story arrives at the present time, the story attaches to you and you are drawn in. I haven't found a Mark Tufo book I didn't love. This was a very interesting book, with choices and decisions that the main character must make. The ending was quite surprising to me, in fact many of the outcomes in the story surprised me. I felt it was a very good read.

While there is a lot of potential behind the story everything about it seemed force, there is no natural flow to the words, everything seems to be exaggerated for no reason. Callis does not come across as sympathetic at any point, I really could not find it in me to invest any emotions into her or any of the other characters in the book. With the exception of Callis' dad everyone in this book is just horrid. And while there is some of the Tufo humor that I know and love it is not enough to save this book for me. I love Mark's Zombie Fallout and Indian Hill series and I thought this one would suck me in also, but I could not help but feel like it was rushed and there was something missing the entire time that I was reading. This modern day Carrie failed to sweep me off my feet with words."}, {"userName": "Anne Seebach", "userReviewDate": "Mar 09, 2014", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/5455711-anne-seebach", "userReview": "Reminiscent of 'Carrie', though not at all the same story. I'd have to say I did like it overall, but it didn't flow as well for me as some of the author's other works. I'm not quite sure why, but I found the storytelling often a bit plodding - perhaps because it didn't have as much of the leavening, sarcastic humour Tufo usually injects into his stories. About halfway through I found myself becoming a little irritated with Callis and wanting her (and the story) to just 'move on already'. There were a lot of interesting characters we spent a little bit of time with, but they weren't really fulfilled - it felt rather 'Callis heavy'. Two and a half stars from me."}, {"userName": "Glenda", "userReviewDate": "Feb 10, 2013", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/9099949-glenda", "userReview": "Callis Rose is a young girl that has telekinesis, as Stephen King's Carrie White did, and lands herself in foster care after a tragedy strikes her family. Callis Rose bounces from one bad foster care home to another. Mark Tufo describes some really brutal crimes on children in this book, including pedophilia. I gave Callis Rose 3 stars because simply put I didn't like the characters in Callis Rose or root for them to pull through. But I did meet up with a favorite character from ZF again! I do have to say that the story was packed with action to the last word.

I kept reading at first because it was reminding a bit of Carrie and I wanted to see exactly where it was going to go. The story flows from point to point well and makes sense for the most part. there were just a few things that I had an issue with and they were mainly related to a few of the characters. It seems someone does not think highly of the social services system and gave them a pick poke here.The characters are both believable and unbelievable in the sense that there are those that I can relate to easily and those that seem to be total fabrications of a type. While Mindy Denton as a 'mean girl' seems totally plausible, the lengths that she goes to in order to rid herself of Callis does not ring true with me. Callis herself is real for me, a girl who has done something wrong at a young age but really tries to not make the same mistakes. I liked her because she was vulnerable and just wanted what everyone does, a normal life.I do have to say though that much of what happened I saw coming if for no other reason than that this was a story about high school girls. I was one once and these girls were like a lot of the ones I went to school with. Not to mention that I have read a lot of books with similar plot lines.The first time Callis ever used her power she was six years old and neither she nor her mother understood what was happening. As she grew older she used this power by accident and her mother told herself that it was nothing. The day everything changed for Callis marked a turning point for and her family, Callis became an orphan and ended up in the system. When Callis arrives at the Lowries, her new foster family life gets better than she could ever imagine. On the first day of school she meets a boy who becomes the light of her young life, she also meets a girl who will be a bitter enemy, the problem is they are brother and sister. I have read Zombie Fallout by Mark Tufo and loved them so much I had to give this a look too. It does not disappoint. He is a really good writer who manages to take you places you would not expect to go and when you get there you do not want to leave. I felt for Callis and was so mad at her angry antagonist that I would have fought for her. Enjoy this!"}, {"userName": "Christine", "userReviewDate": "Aug 31, 2013", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/9976469-christine", "userReview": "I was able to have the opportunity of listening to an Audio book of 'Callis Rose' as an ARC (Advanced Reader's Copy) on Goodreads.Wow. I have no clue what to say about this book. I will say it took me a while to get used to the Audio (this was my first audio book). In the beginning, I wasn't entirely roped into the story. I thought the book was just about a spoiled girl, but boy was I wrong. When Callis was transported between different Foster homes, I felt a large amount of sympathy for her. A girl at such a young age nearly experienced rape twice and abuse. I hated how awful everyone was in these homes, only Joshua (the baby) and her second Foster Mother were good.I thought her powers were interesting. They were weird but it worked in the story. Kevin. He was the only genuine person in this whole novel. His compassion and love toward Callis was beautiful. For once I thought that Callis finally had something in her life worth something. Their relationship was the ONLY thing I liked about the book. Even through the worst of times they were still together in love. Then Kevin's B***H of a sister, Mindy ruined everything. From then on I thought Mindy deserved whatever came to her. Thanks to Mindy, Callis lost everything dear to her, so much pain was inflicted upon her. I started to dislike the book when things got out of hand and became dark, murderous and wrong. The writing was good. A bit too descriptive in some areas but I highly disliked the amount of swearing that came from all the characters, I would have been fine if there was a small amount but there was a swear word nearly every sentence.I was speechless at the end. I had no idea what to personally take out of the book. It was ok but not one of my favourite books. I know I gave it a 2 Star but I really would have put 2.5 Stars. Even though I didn't really like Callis Rose, I would suggest you read it for yourself and make yoour own views."}, {"userName": "I.S.

The cover did intrigue me, but I do not think that was it. All I know is I am glad I did notice it and I am glad I tried it. I enjoyed every minute of the 9+ hours it took.\tCallis Rose is a girl with a supernatural ability. They do not reveal the true natural of it until the very end of the story; she had the ability to control people. The ability first manifests when she is a small child and she learns to use it, as she gets older.\tLike all teenage girl stories, she eventually runs into a boy that she likes, mean girls, and a need for better clothes. This is after she spent most of her childhood in the foster care system. Yes, her parents die when she is young but I will not spoil how that happens.\tI guess the one pratfall of this story is that it is dark and depressing. The main protagonist Callis Rose is victimized a lot both by circumstance and by external forces. Much of her suffering though is brought on by her own actions.\tMany people are comparing this story to Carrie by Stephen King. I can see this story being inspired by that but it is not the same story. It\u2019s not like comparing 50 Shades to Twilight. If you prefer rainbows and unicorns, this story is not for you.

I think I'm a tad heartbroken. I would easily, hands down, rate the first 75% of this book a 5 star read, but then, something just happened. It felt like the last part was written by someone else. It lost the passion that the majority of this book had. I lost connection with the characters. They felt foreign all of a sudden. I just don\u2019t get it. The last 25% was a 3 star read for me. It just felt rushed and I felt no sense of closure at the end. To be honest, I was pissed! Perhaps I'm just bitchy because the potential for this book was endless. I mean, it is in a class of its own. I was hooked, and it sucked me in. I loved the characters, the excitement, and most of all the revenge. I am all about some vengeance!I was fortunate, and got this as a freebie on amazon. I'm going to go with an overall 4 star rating because of this. I think if the last 4th of this book had been as good as the first 3/4ths I would easily qualify this as one of my favorite 2013 reads.

His Johnny Lunchbucket character facing the Zombie Apocalypse was a refreshing take on the sub-genre. (Unfortunately, the series decayed.) This book is similar to those stories, but without Zombies.The story is a mashup of Cinderella and Carrie. It has the same type of low-middle brow characters and POV as the Zombie Fallout series. I didn't find anything in this story to be new or too demanding.Tufo really wants to be just like Stephen King when he grows up. However, he doesn't have that much range. Some parts of this book are funny. However, clever snarkyness does not make a novel.I would pass this one up, because there are too many better stories, \"out there\" to spend your time reading.
