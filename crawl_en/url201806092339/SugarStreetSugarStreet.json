With its story of women willing to do everything to save their marriages but ultimately saving themselves in the process, M.J. Pullen's SUGAR STREET sucked me in and wouldn't let me go until the very last page If you're looking for a riveting, rolicking, heartwarming story with a core of steel, don't miss this gem!"}, {"userName": "Chris Negron", "userReviewDate": "May 23, 2018", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/13339221-chris-negron", "userReview": "It's so difficult to write a novel with multiple points of view well, so that each character is different and fully realized, but M.J. does it magnificently in this risqu\u00e9 romance. I loved how each of the characters' marriages were teetering on a foundation that was slightly cracked for different, unique, and realistic reasons, and the threads of the plot all came together brilliantly at the end. Can't wait to see what M.J. does with these characters next!"}, {"userName": "Diane", "userReviewDate": "May 29, 2018", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/5246393-diane", "userReview": "Sugar Street by author M.J. Pullen is about four women who decided to make their husbands jealous in order to spice up their love life but end up making a deal with the Devil, The story is well written and even though Jess, Delia, Carras, and Maizy are not best friends, they stick together during the good and the bad of their decision. I won't post spoilers, but the story is very entertaining. The bargain the four women make could work out well, or they could lose everything, it is a gamble they are willing to take to shake up their husbands and change their married lives. Personally, I could never believe Georgia girls could be so naive as to agree to this type of arrangement, but the loyalty the women have for each other is a southern thing and it works for the story. The wonderful thing about the story is each of the women finds her own inner strength and recognizes the value of her own self-worth within the family dynamic.(Mature Themes)Thank you to NetGalley and the Publisher for the opportunity to read and review this book."}, {"userName": "Gaylen Brainard", "userReviewDate": "May 29, 2018", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/67845612-gaylen-brainard", "userReview": "This book was full of surprises all the way to the end - A smart, funny, racy romance that peers unflinchingly into the lives of four desperate women and their relationships with their husbands... a deeply insightful and engrossing read!"}, {"userName": "Cole", "userReviewDate": "Jun 06, 2018", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/13464001-cole", "userReview": "3.5"}, {"userName": "Kristin", "userReviewDate": "Jun 05, 2018", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/43036036-kristin", "userReview": "\"Thank you Netgalley and the publisher for the advance copy of this book, in exchange for an honest review.\"Loved this book very much.
