The novel is set in Russia between the end of the Russo-Japanese War (1905) and the start of the Bolshevik Revolution (1917). The Fixer tells the story of Yakov Bok, a Jew dwelling in a Russian shtetl 30 versts from Kiev who tries to work as a general handyman, a fixer. But there's not much to fix in the shtetl, and not much money to go around in payment. Bok is usually paid in soup. But Bok is ambitious and after being left by his wife, whom he believes barren, he heads for nearby Kiev where there dwells a large population of Jews living in the ghetto. He believes that in the shtetl life was passing him by. On his way to Kiev, he fantasizes about wealth and property and a new wife who bears him beautiful children. He is able to pass for a Russian. One day he finds a fat man, Nikolai Maximovitch, face down in the snow. Turning him over he detects first the liquour on his breath and then the emblem of the Black Hundreds, a virulently anti-Semitic group, on his coat. The man's daughter appears and together they carry the inebriate home. As a reward, Bok is put to work papering the flat Nikolai Maximovutch owns above his own, for 40 rubles--an enormous sum. Later, Bok is promoted to run the Russian's brick factory. When a dead boy is found, and his death absurdly attributed to nonexistent Jewish practices, Bok is picked up by the police. It's clear from the start that their only goal is to frame him for this murder. The intensity of false witness borne against Bok simply astonishes. The monstrous hate with which his accusers are consumed stuns the mind. The so-called testimonies from so-called witnesses reveal a legal system rotten to the core. Everyone, it seems, is a pathological liar. The fixer is then moved to prison and it is here that Malamud appears to do the impossible: to take us through a day to day existence that is bleakness itself and yet which holds the reader through sheer narrative impetus. Arthur Koestler's Darkness at Noon was probably a model for Malamud, and without question Dostoyevsky's Crime and Punishment. Solzhenitsyn's Gulag Archipelago did not appear until 1972 and The Fixer was published in 1966. Both are set in Russia and contain long detailed sections about coercing false confessions. I know a lot of readers abhor this book, or any book not about sunny, feel-good topics. Those readers are apparently in the game for its power to divert them from their current miseries. The Fixer isn't interested in doing that. It is in fact about misery, about suffering. It's almost as if Malamud said: Let me take the grimmest subject matter imaginable and not only make it supremely readable, but make it into art. However, he has done far more than that. He has also dramatized a common plight under the ignorant Tsar Nicholas II--whose entire family would shortly be executed by the Bolsheviks--and thereby instructs us all in matters of virtue."}, {"userName": "Ted", "userReviewDate": "Feb 16, 2012", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/7213075-ted", "userReview": "kissing this book goodbye from my real book-shelves ... probably my fault that I didn't quite see the artistic depths of the novel.The is a Pulitzer prize winning novel. I found it a very depressing read. It tells a story that, in its historical setting, is believable. The main character is a victim of circumstances, for which we feel sympathy, and even horror when we reflect on the fate that befalls men. But he is not actually very likable. All of these things are good, or at worst, not bad. I just skimmed through the last 60 pages of the book, perhaps I will change my mind about it at some point. But for now, the one thing that I dislike about the book is its resolution. Perhaps very artistic, but it seemed to me that Malamud finally couldn't decide how he wanted to end the book, and just stopped writing.

Taste them, enjoy them and then roll them around in your head. \u201cIf I have any philosophy\u201d, said Yakov Bok, \u201cit is that life could be better than it is.\u201d\u201cOne thing I\u2019ve learned\", he thought, \"there\u2019s no such thing as an unpolitical man, especially a Jew. You can\u2019t be one without the other, that\u2019s clear enough. You can\u2019t sit still and see yourself destroyed.\u201dYakov reflects as he goes to his trial, \u201cWhat is it Spinoza says? If the state acts in ways that are abhorrent to human nature it\u2019s the lesser evil to destroy it. Death to the anti-Semites! Long live revolution!\u201dIn discussing Spinoza the investigating magistrate asks Yakov how one can achieve freedom if all life is bound by \u201cNecessity\u201d (determinism). Yakov replies, \u201cThat's in your thought, your honor, if your thought is in God. That's if you believe in this kind of God; that's if you reason it out. It's as if a man flies over his own head on the wings of reason, or some such thing. You join the universe and forget your worries.\u201dThis book is an intense, gripping depiction of discrimination of the Jews in Czarist Russia at the beginning of the 20th century. It is based on the incarceration of Menahem Mendel Beilis, which eventually lead to trial in 1913. We are given a fictionization of the arrest and two and half years in prison awaiting trial. In the fictional account, the imprisoned Jew is Yakov Bok, apolitical, a freethinker and unreligious. He is your Everyman. He has left his wife, his father in law and the shtetl, all that had ever been home. Six years married, still no child and his wife has left him for a lover. In Kiev, he hopes to make something of himself, but it is in Kiev that he is accused of killing and draining blood from a Christian child. It is Passover and the blood is supposedly a necessary ingredient for the holiday matzos. He is accused of ritual murder. That he has rejected Judaism and that he declares himself to be a freethinker is discounted. The truth is if it were not him another Jew would have been accused. He was there, at the wrong place and at the wrong time, and he is Jewish by birth. It is his treatment during incarceration that is so intense and so gripping. It is brutal and in no way an easy read. Yakov\u2019s mental and psychological transformation is the second element of the story. Here ugly horror is balanced by hope. Maybe\u2026.. Spinoza is brought into the context of the story over and over again. Yakov is no philosopher. He is just your ordinary man trying, if only marginally, to improve himself. He had come across the Spinoza book at a flea market, and picked it up for a kopek. A wasted kopek most probably, but then he started reading and it made a place in his thoughts most definitely! He is struggling to make sense of life. In prison forces are physically and mentally annihilating him. Conversely, he is struggling to cope and to find a reason for living. See what I have underlined in the last quote above.I might say that the story goes on a bit too long. Hallucinations at the book\u2019s end detract from the story\u2019s believability and impact. They are too clever, too after-the-fact.The book is about racism and prejudicial discrimination. It is not really philosophical, but you watch how philosophy changes Yakov. The telling is matter of fact, down to earth, but intense. The narration of the audiobook, by Victor Bevine, is very well done. I had no problem following any of the lines. Punlished in 1966, The Fixer won both the Pulitzer and the National Book Award for fiction. Menahem Mendel Beilis\u2019 descendants claim that Malamud had plagiarized the English edition of their memoir. See Blood Libel: The Life and Memory of Mendel Beilis: Includes: Beilis's Memoir, the Story of My Sufferings; And Pulitzer Plagiarism: What Bernard Malamud's the Fixer Owes to the Memoir of Mendel Beilis.

This is the book that won Malamud the Nobel, and I had to wonder why. It\u2019s ideological, heavy handed, a hammer on your skull, bald-faced allegory, and miserable to read, pages and pages of suffering. I know there\u2019s a grand point here, and it has something to do with the philosophy of Spinoza (which I haven\u2019t read), God\u2019s betrayal of the Jews after WWII, the reordering of one\u2019s worldview after Evil has shown its face and won, the attempt to locate spirituality and morality in a world without God, the slow glimmer of revelation that Jewishness is not in the end really Chosenness in any sense that can improve your life. I love these themes, but they come across better, for me, in a treatment of an old Jew in New York finding God in Harlem, a Jewish family trusting an untrustworthy Italian goy, an encounter between spiritually and morally flawed characters from colliding cultures who will each find redemption in ways that will surprise you. Malamud\u2019s other works, like Flannery O\u2019Connor\u2019s, embody both apostasy and a deeply religious and redemptive view of the world; they are about a spirituality that needs no God. I love that. I know these themes are in this tome as well but I still don\u2019t get it.

Ed \u00e8 un romanzo eccezionale, rappresenta una vetta sublime e inimitabile nel mondo della letteratura contemporanea. Nel romanzo, sofferenza e umiliazione sono raccontate come condizioni universali e ineluttabili, il dolore si percepisce come una porta per la maturazione, il riscatto e la consapevolezza. La tragedia individuale viene vissuta come mito collettivo, rituale che tende a ripetersi, a farsi eterno; la disgrazia e l'ingiustizia costituiscono un ambiente originario e immanente per l'eroe di Malamud, un teatro nel quale recitare una parte ineludibile e dove cercare una evoluzione che sia liberazione dal senso di colpa e di vergogna, che connota l'essere ebreo e pi\u00f9 radicalmente l'essere diverso, l'essere singolo soggetto non conforme n\u00e9 adattabile all'avidit\u00e0 e alla distruttivit\u00e0 del reale. Il romanzo si ispira a un fatto di cronaca del 1911, l'antisemitismo diffuso che condusse la Russia zarista a accusare e imprigionare l'ebreo ucraino Mendel Beilis per l'omicidio di un bambino a scopi religiosi e rituali (il processo, non narrato, si concluse con l'assoluzione). L'immaginazione di Malamud crea un'esperienza di parola irripetibile all'interno di una tradizione che va da Giobbe a Kafka alla tradizione yiddish: \u00e8 sempre l'uomo che soffre al centro della storia e l'individuo in prigione diviene simbolo di uno stato metafisico, di una corporeit\u00e0 innocente, vincolata e offesa, mai riconosciuta. Cos\u00ec la vita di Yakov Bok consegna al lettore un'allegoria esistenziale, il viaggio di un'anima al cospetto di un'entit\u00e0 che rispecchia un potere onnipotente e ultraterreno nella sua delirante inalterabilit\u00e0, univocit\u00e0 di posizione e prepotente violenza. Non c'\u00e8 spazio per il dissimile, non c'\u00e8 luogo per il vero perch\u00e9 \u00e8 necessario placare la ferocia della persecuzione e della discriminazione, il desiderio illimitato di mettere sotto processo e annientare l'altro, che rappresenta il personaggio che contiene il disconosciuto, il negato e il rimosso. Per questo l'unica via percorribile \u00e8 il cambiamento effettivo, la redenzione tramite la rielaborazione concreta, l'attesa di un evento fisico di salvezza, persino il sogno di una rivolta contro il tiranno, la conquista della libert\u00e0 attraverso un calvario dietro al quale si intuisce un esito positivo. Per lo scrittore newyorchese resistere al dolore comporta trovare una sorta di silenziosa quiete, un sentimento equilibrato di inspiegabile sollievo, che somiglia alla felicit\u00e0 mai concessa alla moltitudine, eterna promessa e fonte di tormento. Malamud racconta bene come siamo composti di paure irrazionali e memoria ostinata e quanto profonda possa rivelarsi la nostra solitudine; la sua scrittura meravigliosa e implacabile esprime pienamente e con compassione l'essenza umana, quell'errare dentro di s\u00e9, nella nostra sostanza paradossale e nella nostra estraneit\u00e0 indicibile e minacciosa. Cos\u00ec la volont\u00e0 da opzione arbitraria acquisisce il carattere di una continuit\u00e0 di destino e di scelta.

He simply wants a better life. He is slightly bitter that life gives him lemons but no sugar to make lemonade but that does not keep him from trying to improve. He reads Spinoza to educate himself and moves to Kiev to start a better life. He is a repairman aka a \"fixer\". Unfortunately, he is also a Jew in Tsarist Russia.I like Yakov. He is Everyman. He is not a hero nor a wise man. But he is sincere and honest. He is a basically honest man placed in an horrific situation. His one deceit, trying to pass as a gentile in an anti-Semitic society, is a deceit born of desperation and survival. Yakov is accused of killing a young boy in a \"Blood Ritual\". In the Russia of 1905 he has little chance of proving himself innocent. He is beaten and thrown in jail to waste away only to be repeatedly told to sign a confession to stop the torture. Yakov refuses but his faith in humanity, in society and in God is tested and weakened. He meets only one man who is willing to fight for him but even that is no match for the fears and prejudices of an unfair society.Malamud is not the type of writer to sugar-coat anything. His style is to the point and his descriptions of prison life comes close to unbearable. Yet Yakov remains the focus of this tale and that is the strength. Many of the most moving moments comes when Yakov have delusions and dreams caused by starvation, illness and general suffering. These delusional dialogues hold much of the philosophical meat of the novel. The ending dialogue of Yakov talking to Tzar Nicholas is a fitting and satisfactory scene in a climax that looks open-ended but really isn'., For while the author packs a lot of social and political discussion points in his tale, it is really about the emotional and philosophical journey of Yakov who would like to \"fix\" much more than just material objects but doesn't know how.I don't know how well Malamud has held up in the 21st century.

What is the greatest freedom, but the freedom of the mind? In the Fixer, Yakov Bok is a man accused of a brutal crime, and is forced to see new depths of human degradation every day during his imprisonment. His suffering hasn\u2019t just begun then; no, his suffering began since time immemorial, when his people were persecuted for their beliefs, and subjected to vile, violent and senseless racism (not that racism has any sense in the first place). \u2018In or out, it was history that counted-the world\u2019s bad memory. It remembered the wrong things. So for a Jew it was the same wherever he went, he carried a remembered pack on his back-a condition of servitude, diminished opportunity, vulnerability'.How much worse is it, then, when you are persecuted for the belief you lost, or never had in the first place? This is Yakov\u2019s major dilemma, as a man struggling for meaning outside the realms of religion. The Fixer is one of those thoroughly enjoyable books that blends history, philosophy (the book is a vehicle for Spinoza\u2019s core beliefs, such as the State\u2019s responsibility for the peace and security of its people, and God as the impersonal force of Nature), and although there are parts where the plot doesn\u2019t move much, you are so tied to the main character\u2019s fate that this book just zips along. Typical of Malamud, he draws the full spectrum of his character; no one is strictly a hero, especially when one is only on the road to redemption. The only complaint I\u2019d have against this book is that there were times when Yakov\u2019s self-pitying grates; but when the weight of historical fallacy is enforced by millions against a few, the choices between extreme suffering and death are but few.

Lonoff), anziano e ammirato scrittore, che alcuni ritennero ispirato alla figura di Malamud (altri per\u00f2 dicono Bellow, altri ancora Henry Roth!).Comunque sia, dopo la delusione iniziale per la distanza stilistica da Roth (cui lo accomuna l\u2019ossessione del tema dell\u2019ebraismo e poco altro), accentuata dal fatto che ho trovato \u201cL\u2019uomo di Kiev\u201d piuttosto datato mentre ritengo la narrativa di Roth universale e sempre attuale, piano piano il romanzo di Malamud mi ha avvolto nelle sue spire ed alla fine mi ha convinto, facendomi superare le remore che avevano condizionato la lettura della prima parte.Stranamente \u00e8 proprio a partire dall\u2019arresto di Yakov e dal conseguente restringimento della scena che Malamud imprime, in modo non brusco ma inesorabile, una svolta, quasi un\u2019apertura al racconto. Le progressive privazioni e sofferenze fisiche e morali cui l\u2019innocente prigioniero viene sottoposto, si accompagnano a una sorta di ascesi dello spirito in cui, pur rifiutando di ammettere colpe inesistenti, il protagonista acquisisce imprevedibilmente una pacificazione e un\u2019accettazione del destino avverso, fino al finale aperto che \u00e8 un azzeccato colpo di sceneggiatura, quasi che il percorso interiore fosse pi\u00f9 importante della conclusione della vicenda.Lo stile di Malamud \u00e8 piuttosto rigido e disadorno, tutto il contrario delle vertiginose evoluzioni e dei virtuosismi che Philip Roth adotta in molti romanzi, e quindi invece di affascinare e a rendersi accattivante, tende a respingere, riproponendo ossessivamente il tema dell\u2019atavico senso di colpa dell\u2019ebreo che in diverse forme, dalla satira alla tragedia, tanti artisti ci hanno elargito. Resta nella memoria l\u2019immagine di un povero Cristo incatenato non a una croce ma al muro sporco di una cella (immagine paradossale trattandosi di un ebreo perseguitato da cristiani), impegnato a mantenere integro quel che resta del proprio equilibrio mentale, fra le rare visite reali di parenti o avvocati che si avvicendano alle sempre pi\u00f9 frequenti apparizioni di fantasmi, personaggi morti, addirittura lo Zar!"}, {"userName": "Simona", "userReviewDate": "Apr 20, 2017", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/6222130-simona", "userReview": "I personaggi dei romanzi di Malamud portano con s\u00e9 sempre un velo di malinconia e \"L'uomo di Kiev\" non fa eccezione.

Reading it again so many years later I wondered how it would hold up.Yakov Bok, the Fixer of the title, is a free-thinking Jew whose trade is that of a handyman from the Pale in the Ukraine (where Jews are legally allowed to reside) in the last years of the Tsarist regime not long after the disastrous war that Russia lost against Japan, the aborted revolution that followed that defeat and the pogroms that diverted the Russian people down channels that were more acceptable to the Russian state.Life is not going well for Bok, his wife has ran away with a Goy and work is hard to find within the Pale. He eventually bites the bullet, sells up and decides to move to nearby Kiev to look for a chance to improve his situation, perhaps to earn enough and emigrate from Russia. After a period of hardship in Kiev Bok hits on some \"luck\" and gains the patronage of a Russian gentleman, some well paid employment before eventually being offered the position of foreman at the Russian's Brick-factory. Everything is going well, except the Russian is a member of the anti-Semitic Black Hundreds who doesn't know that Bok is of Jewish extraction. The factory is also sited in an area of Kiev that is out of bounds to Jews. When a twelve year old Christian boy is \"ritually\" murdered not far from the factory, a worker who Bok had previously caught thieving and who suspects that he is Jewish raises suspicions about him with the Police. Bok is arrested, his identity as a Jew is quickly ascertained and he becomes the number one suspect for the murder of the boy. The world that then envelops him makes Josef K's experience in \"The Trial\" seem like a holiday.\"The Fixer\" is an extraordinary work of literature, written for the most part in an understated manner that never the less contains some extremely powerful writing. Bok, as a character comes alive for the reader with great vividness without him being portrayed simply as a victim. Essentially a realistic novel, it does contain passages of almost hallucinatory terror that stick in the readers mind long after it is finished, though on occasions during the middle section I felt this was perhaps overdone, devaluing to an extent the otherwise impeccable realism that is the \"The Fixers\" major strength. The book appears (and my knowledge of Tsarist Russia before the 1917 revolution is far from encyclopedic) to have a firm rooting in historical experience, and conveys with regard to the Russian characters a sense of the divisions and clashes between an authoritarian establishment and some of the liberal groups and personalities of the time. It's disappointing that this book isn't better known and I thoroughly recommend it to anyone who has time for writing that makes them both think and feel."}, {"userName": "Ademption", "userReviewDate": "Jul 22, 2008", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/1045093-ademption", "userReview": "[Unpleasantly well crafted, the book ends abruptly with no closure whatsoever.

There may have been a time or two I have been this relieved that I have finally finished a book, but it hasn't happened often. It was such a relief to close that book knowing I never have to open it again. I know that \"The Fixer\" has won both the National Book Award and the Pulitzer Prize, just knowing that made me go and find out what it takes to win either of these awards and this is what I found just in case you're interested: \"Pulitzer Prize for Fiction: for distinguished fiction by an American author, preferably dealing with American life.National Book Award: Its mission is \"to celebrate the best of American literature, to expand its audience, and to enhance the cultural value of good writing in America.\"I trust that \"The Fixer\" deserves both of these awards, I still hated it. I know that lots and lots and lots of people love the book, I still hated it. \"The Fixer\" was written by Bernard Malamud and published in 1966. What I find even more depressing than the novel is that it is a fictionalized version of something that really happened. Menahem Mendel Beilis was a Jewish man unjustly imprisoned in Tsarist Russia. The \"Beilis trial\" of 1913 caused an international uproar and Russia backed down in the face of this indignation. The only good thing, two good things I guess about this real event is that there was an international uproar and that Russia backed down, although why they were doing terrible things to Jewish people in the first place is beyond me. Of course why anyone does terrible things to anyone else is beyond me. Maybe doing terrible things to entire big groups of people astonishes me even more, even if you don't like one or two people what can you possibly have against all of them?. I'm not going to tell you if the awful people doing awful things to our main character back down in the face of indignation at the end or not, just in case you want to read the book and would rather not have the ending spoiled.As to the story, in the novel our main character is Yakov Bok, a Jewish handyman or \"fixer\". The book begins in a shtetl, a Russian village, (yes I looked it up) where Yakov lives with his father-in-law, Shmuel. Yakov\u2019s wife, Raisl, has left him for another man. The marriage was troubled mainly because the couple did not have a child. Yakov has made a decision to leave the shtetl and go elsewhere where hopefully his luck will improve. Well he's wrong about that one. He loads a few things onto a wagon and heads to Kiev. However when Yakov reaches Kiev, he has difficulty making a living, there are just no jobs for Jews. Then one evening he finds a man lying drunk in the snow and helps the man's daughter take him home. The man, Lebedev, rewards him for his help by offering him a job at a brickyard that he owns. Yakov needs the job but is troubled because to take it he will have to live at the brickyard and Jews aren't allowed to live in that section of the city, I don't know why- just add it to the list of things I don't understand. He does take the job not telling Lebedev he is Jewish or his real name. Eventually some of the workers there find out he is Jewish, so when Yakov is arrested he thinks he is being arrested for living in a restricted area off-limits to Jews. At first he is unaware of the actual accusations which are of \"ritual murder of a child\". A twelve year old boy has been found dead in a cave with many stab wounds in the body. Yakov is jailed without being officially charged and denied visitors or legal counsel. When he asks for a lawyer he is told that it is not possible at this stage. The indictment must come first and the indictment won't come until there is a preliminary examination by the Investigating Magistrate and the Prosecuting Attorney. If they agree there should be an indictment they write one and it is sent to the District Court where it is either confirmed or disapproved by the judges. After all this the prisoner is given a copy of it and then within a week or two, possibly more, the accused may select his counsel and inform the court. What a terrible legal system this is. A man could be in jail for years just waiting for the indictment which is what happens to Yakov. Not only that, but no one believes that Yakov committed the murder in the first place. I don't believe it, the prosecutor doesn't believe it, or other prisoners, or the warden, or the guards or anyone else in the book, but no one cares, they want to convict Yakov of the crime because he is Jewish. I probably said this ten times already but I'm saying it again, why they are determined to arrest and torment a Jewish person is beyond me. There were words in the book used fairly often that I looked up just to be sure of what they meant, one of them was pogrom; lots of people running around in this book wanted to have a pogrom and here it is:\"an organized massacre of a particular ethnic group, in particular that of Jews in Russia or eastern Europe.\"An organized massacre?? Who would organize a massacre? Who would want to do this? Again, I don't know. Then we have \"matzo\", which is \"an unleavened bread traditionally eaten by Jewish people during the week-long Passover holiday.\" There seems to be nothing wrong with this only these horrible book people claim that Yakov and all the other Jewish people make it with the blood of Christians to cure their diseases or some such absolutely stupid reason. Then there is Father Anastasy, a priest who is a self-proclaimed expert - also insane in my opinion - on ritual murder. He tells us:\"In the recorded past,' said Father Anastasy in his nasally musical voice, ' the Jew has had many uses for Christian blood. He has used it for purposes of sorcery and witches' rituals, and for love potions and well poisoning, fabricating a deadly venom that spread the plague from one country to another, a mixture of Christian blood from a murdered victim, their own Jewish urine, the heads of poisonous snakes, and even the stolen mutilated host - the bleeding body of Christ himself.\"I'm not sure how crazy Father Anastasy thinks the Jewish people are supposed to get their hands on the body of Christ bleeding or otherwise since at this moment He is in heaven with our Father, but I don't really care of Father Anastasy's ideas on that anyway. I could add many more horrible quotes like that one but I don't want to, thinking of this book makes my head hurt. Then we get to read of Yakov being in prison and eating soup with cockroaches in it, of getting beat not just by guards but also by prisoners who beat him either because they believe him guilty or because he's Jewish, you decide which one. At one point in this \"lovely\" book Yakov's feet get sores on them, the sores become infected and swollen and the pain and swelling begins to move up his legs, he also becomes feverish. Finally the warden sends him to the infirmary but no one is allowed to help him get there and he has to crawl the entire way. There are these atrocious body searches that the evil deputy warden has done to Yakov six times a day even though he is kept in solitary confinment and chained to a wall. What in the world are they searching for?I don't want to think about this book any more so I'm done with this. I know it won awards and all that and because of that it must be a wonderful book, so take their word for it and not mine. I read that it is \"wonderfully written\", \"one of the world's richest novels\", \"a literary event in any season\". All kinds of things like that, but I don't know or care when a book is \"wonderfully written\" I just know I hate it. I hate that people can do things like this to each other. I refuse to give it more than one star because of how it made me feel no matter how many awards it won, I do however, recommend it to everyone, after all you will have to like it better than I did."}, {"userName": "Gautam", "userReviewDate": "Sep 15, 2016", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/32002534-gautam", "userReview": "Review soon."}, {"userName": "Joey", "userReviewDate": "Jan 12, 2014", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/10049704-joey", "userReview": "POGROM is the word which can give readers an idea of what this book is all about. This means a planned killing of large numbers of people, especially Jews, usually done for reasons of race or religion. In other words, it is synonymous with MASSACRE. The book, therefore, deals with anti-Semitism during Tsarist Russia beyond my knowledge of World History.This book breaks my heart and makes me feel for the protagonist, Yakov Bok, a Jewish fixer by trade, who dreamed to make something of himself by moving to Kiev after he was ratted out on by his wife Raisl. He was accused of murdering a Christian boy during Passover. He was jailed without official charges and maltreated like an animal, as though I wanted to help him by telling the prejudiced people that he is downright innocent of the crime. In addition, reading right smack dab in the middle of the book makes me abandon myself to the antagonists: Their cruelty, ignorance, and irrationality make me abhor them,particularly the History of Anti-Semiticism. So I am like holding hopes against hopes for Yakov; then, I am kicked in the stomach when his hopes are dashed many times,and when he is almost mentally and physically tortured. Nevertheless, I am impressed by his survival instinct and dogged-determination not to confess to the crime he did not do in spite of repeated torture and degradation.Gee,this book turns out to be a page-turner; I cannot put it down, excited and apprehensive about what may become of the protagonist at the end. Had I not been busy these past few days, I could have finished it for one night.I would say that this book is deserving of winning the Pulitzer-Prize and National Book Awards despite the fact that Bernard Malamud was said to have plagiarized the book from BEILI'S memoir, The Story of My Sufferings from which he drew inspiration. It is steeped in Spinoza's philosophy, existentialism, politics, and religion. At the end of the story, Yakov realized that a man is a political animal after all even if he had considered himself apolitical and a freethinker. Essentially, it deals with discrimination against Jews as well as their abject misery under pogrom period as what Bernard Malamud may have intended to tell the world since he was an American-Jewish writer. In fact, this book reminds me of notable novels written on passionate purpose by famous writers to make a big difference- Richard Wright\u2019s NATIVE SON and UNCLE TOM'S CABIN by Harriet Beecher Stowe on Slavery;A PASSAGE TO INDIA by E. M. Forrester and NOLI ME TANGERE by Jose Rizal on Independence Movement and so on. So Bernard Malamud\u2019s is on Anti-Semitism .These kinds of books, regardless of writing skills , that I find remarkable and that should be heralded as good and great books are deserving of 5 stars. So I wonder why this book is not included on the list of 1001 BEST NOVELS OF All TIME EVERYONE MUST READ by The Guardian.Deeply impressed with Bernard Malamud , I can\u2019t help reading his another notable book, THE ASSISTANT, hailed by TIME as one of the 100 best novels of all time since 1924. ^^"}, {"userName": "Saverio Mariani", "userReviewDate": "May 22, 2015", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/12836691-saverio-mariani", "userReview": "Brevi appunti su un libro bellissimo.Malamud inizia il romanzo con una sordina che gli impedisce quasi di parlare.

(1966). Bernard Malamud. *****.This is probably Malamud\u2019s best known work, and was the winner of both the National Book Award and the Pulitzer Prize. This is the first I\u2019ve read it since its publication in 1966. I was amazed at how much of the story stuck with me over the years. The \u2018fixer\u2019 was Yakov Bok, an itinerant Jewish handyman. He was modeled after the real-life character, Mendel Beiliss, who was arrested and falsely charged with the murder of a 12-year old boy in order to satisfy ritualistic requirements. (See my review of \u201cBlood Accusation.\u201d) The focus of Malamud\u2019s work was the examination of the trials Bok suffered in prison. He was isolated for over two-and-a-half years in the prison in Kiev, suffering the most brutal treatment by his jailers and accusers. The novel examines the effects such treatment had on the mind and soul of Bok. Many issues are reviewed in this novel: Anti-Semitism in Russia during the period before WW I, the conditions of the Jews in Russia; the state of the Russian government at the time; the attitude of the West towards the Russian regime; the strength of the hero\u2019s belief (or non-belief) in God.

There's a gradualness to the proceedings, an iceberg like slowness that lends both stories a heightened sense of acute dread interspersed by jarring moments of both depravity and humanity that affects the reader so much it could almost be called painful, though not entirely negatively. Imagine left to thirst in a desert until the absence of water is all you have, and then falling into a frozen lake, something like that.What Malamud does is present a character and break him, again and again, and give said character every reason, conceivable or not (he comes within a hair's breadth of madness towards the end) to confess to a crime he didn't commit if only to gain leniency for himself and his fellow Jews in the Pale of Settlement in Russia. But the character, Yakov Bok, doesn't. Much to the chagrin of his captors and tormentors and, I imagine, the befuddlement and even slight rage of his compatriot Jews. Not rage at Bok, but rather rage at their own impotence and place in history as Bok so lucidly (and towards the end wrathfully) elucidates.This is a book of cruelty, with no real heroism to speak of. Bok is not a hero though his resistance and strength of will under horrific conditions in a Russian jail can only rightfully be called superhuman. It was interesting to read a book with a protagonist like this. He's more human than many might like to admit to admiring.What fascinated me most about this book is the central question: why does Yakov Bok continue to live? It's certainly not for religion as he spites God regularly (and not without a certain cathartic pleasure) and certainly not out of love or pride, or out of a sense of brotherhood or unity with anyone or anything. In fact, Bok fits in very well as a consummate outsider of the highest level, someone who, from conception, is destined not to fit, and to be constantly reminded of it and rankled because of it. But his outsider status only solidifies his Jewishness, even if, this is maybe only my interpretation, he is the only true Jew among Jews, as he suffers to a level that few other Jews in the story or in actual history can understand, or want to see or know too much about. The fact that Bok is a fictionalized version of a real person (who was quite different and more pious, apparently) does little to dampen his effect on me, he better serves the overall running theme in the novel as he is and I feel Malamud's character, though not a hero, is immeasurably more memorable and even important than a pious unquestioning gazer towards God's just reward.Reading this book was, in a sense, refreshing. It was bracing to read a detailing of Jewish suffering that precludes the current 'trends' in American Jewish Fiction. The likes of Jonathan Safron Foer and Nicole Krauss have a disconcerting tendency to trivialize the shtetl experience (almost commidifying it for, gross, mass consumption) whilst waving limp hand to the intelligent sensitive strength of Jewish continuity in America and Israel. It's so disingenuous, like Walt Disney presents The Jewish Meta Narrative. Though not without its flaws (the ending text/dialogue blocks detailing the Jewish plight smacked of lecture and a rush to give historical weight) this is a book to be read and contemplated. It's a powerful shot of a story that will stick with you and remind you to never completely forget humanity's capacity to torture and suffer, but to also bear and remain steadfast."}, {"userName": "Mara", "userReviewDate": "Jun 14, 2008", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/330370-mara", "userReview": "What a difficult book to read, and, I can only imagine, to write. We start with the injustice of poverty and lack of opportunity in the shtetl and move almost directly into a variety of unjust accusations leveled against Yakov Bok, who has become a scapegoat for all the imagined evil deeds of all the Jews in Russia.Bok leaves the shtetl with hopes of a better life in Kiev. At first, things look up for him. Serendipity finds him a good job, and he is able to afford some books, and even put away some money. The catch is that he has to live in a district from which Jews are forbidden from living. All goes well, although Bok is not a popular figure, until a young boy is found murdered in a cave nearby.The police show up at his door, arrest him, and summarily throw him in prison. Things go from bad to worse as he is forced to submit to increasingly cruel and dehumanizing treatment, not least of which is having to repeatedly listen to the many crimes he is supposed to have committed. But he steadfastly declares his innocence, and it is this that is supposed to make him one literature's greatest heroes. I'm not so sure about this, but certainly he is a strong character.His strength almost makes this book harder to read, though. I found myself almost wishing he would confess, even though I knew he was innocent, just so the horribleness would end. But he and I both knew that confessing to a crime that he didn't commit wouldn't help at all, either his own dignity, or the plight of the Jews in Russia. So we endured together until the trial, to which Bok is on his way at the end of the book. At first I was disappointed that we don't find out what happens at the trial, but then I realized that the result of the trial isn't the point of the book. It's the persecution and the strength that it reveals that really matter."}], "description": "A classic that won Malamud both the Pulitzer Prize and the National Book Award.The Fixer (1966) is Bernard Malamud's best-known and most acclaimed novel\u2014one that makes manifest his roots in Russian fiction, especially that of Isaac Babel.Set in Kiev in 1911 during a period of heightened anti-Semitism, the novel tells the story of Yakov Bok, a Jewish handyman blamed for the brutal murder of a young Russian boy.
