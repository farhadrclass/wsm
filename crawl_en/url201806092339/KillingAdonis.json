This book definitely had some obvious issues for me, but overall I really enjoyed it!And honestly, this book deserves props because this was one of the only mystery books I've ever read that I didn't guess the ending. I mean I guessed SOME of it, but not all of it.To start, this book follows a girl, Freya, who gets a job working for a very wealthy family as the live in nurse for their son in a coma. She ends up finding out a lot of dark secrets about their family. Think of the family in Revenge but more powerful.I really liked the concept of this book. I liked the family dynamic, the mystery, the plot, the setting and the characters. It was really well done. I enjoyed how it was told and the pacing that the author set for all the various reveals in the book. Where I found this book a little bit lacking was that it seemed confused at times.For example, I personally did not understand the inclusion of Marilyn Monroe/that entire storyline. As well as Freya's sort of issue. I understand Freya's issue a little bit because it helped her connect to Jack, but otherwise it was a little bit confusing to me as to the reasoning for the inclusion. It by no means took away from the story though as they were minor points in the plot.I liked the characters honestly. Freya was a weird eccentric type who I just loved. I liked Jack and all his angst and brooding. I just liked how each of them were developed. My one issue again was that Freya at times did not act like she was in the mid 20s. I often times had to remind myself that she wasn't 17. She was just more immature than I thought she would be, but this is also an issue I had with Jack.The romance was also a bit weird to me. Don't get me wrong, I liked them definitely, but I didn't feel the chemistry, and I don't feel like they had any progression to their relationship as we only saw a few scenes. I'm really bittersweet on the ending. The irony is obviously very strong, but I don't know if I like it.I liked the ending. The reveal for everything made sense, I felt like there were no plot holes and the mystery part was by far the best aspect of this book. Everything well developed (albeit confusing at times). Overall, a good entertaining read! I would recommend it to people who want a light easy mystery!

LIGHT DUTIES. LARGE PAY. (ALL CASH. NO QUESTIONS ASKED OR ANSWERED)'After several hours of swilling booze with best friend Callum, Freya Miller drunkenly emails her CV in response to an unusual ad passed on to her by her friend, Jane. Just hours later she is summoned to the home of the powerful, wealthy and eccentric Vincetti family and promptly hired to care for their revered comatose son, Elijah. Though forcefully warned that curiosity about her employers, their business, or her patient, will not be tolerated, Freya can't resist unearthing their secrets, but is wholly unprepared for what she finds.Killing Adonis is Brisbane writer J.M. Donellan's debut adult fiction novel. With larger than life characters (including a cameo from Marilyn Munroe), a strange mystery and a surreal plot that teeters between farce and satire, it is a quirky and darkly comic story about corporate greed, obscene privilege, and murder.Freya is an entertaining character, quick witted and bold, with a prodigious capacity for booze, an irrational fear of pineapple cutters and the ability to see music as colours (a synesthete). She blithely ignores her employers warnings as she begins to poke around the mansion uncovering, amongst other things, two identical baby's rooms, one entirely pink, and one entirely blue, a room filled with boxes of tiny woollen jumpers (which she later learns are for the penguin victims of an oil spill), three billiard rooms, and Jack.Jack, Elijah's older brother, suffers from mild Osteogenesis Imperfecta (Brittle Bone Disease), agoraphobia and writer's block. He becomes Freya's unlikely, and sometimes unwilling, ally in the hunt for the truth about his brother's coma and his parent's machinations.As Elijah lies silently, a sculptured Adonis surrounded by 'beepers', Freya and Jack begin to investigate the enigma of Elijah's coma, the mystery of the 'Danger Room', the death of a beloved maid and a string of corporate rivals, all to expose Evelyn and Harland Vincetti's diabolical secrets.For me, Killing Adonis was a surprising page turner. I was thoroughly entertained by the snappy writing, audacious characters, and gaudy plot. I wouldn't hesitate to recommend readers comfortable with something a little less mainstream give it a chance - no question."}, {"userName": "Hanaluci", "userReviewDate": "Sep 16, 2014", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/34820260-hanaluci", "userReview": "This book is a very enjoyable read.

That was a very good idea!The humour was the first thing that struck me about this, it's placed in the story when you really need it to even out the mystery element and the creepy weirdness in it.The characters are well written, the mystery is intriguing (although the ending did remind me of something, either another book I've read or a movie/tv show, I can't quite put my finger on it just yet), the setting is Australia so I'm gonna love that anyway and it just all works well together.There is a line about Chewbacca that I lol'd at, on my own, in my room, like a crazy person. It's humour is, in my opinion, what brings it all together.Well done Mr Donellan, well done. Will be keeping my eye on you. In a new book way not in any creepy sort of way :)*Huge thanks to J.M.

She finds the only normal person in the household is oldest son Jack, until she finds out about his problems. The plot unfolds in patchwork fashion, and some of it is on the gory side, but there's also a lot of humor.

For me, the allure of the story was its pseudo positioning as a murder mystery - in some ways I felt like a young girl again, reading my Trixie Belden or Famous Five novels, willing the female protagonist to find the courage and giles to uncover the secrets hidden in the ostentatious mansion in which she was working. In fact, I recall a Nancy Drew reference was made in the story as a throw away line. The writing was snappy and darkly humorous, drawing characters that drifted towards caricatures with their displays of narcissism, malevolence and emotional dysfunction all playing in a conspiracy laden world. The contemporary Brisbane depicted in the novel floated around the edges of the story lending favoured landmarks, bars, institutions and a credible world, a burgeoning city, that existed outside the house of cards, the mansion, inhabited by the uber rich pharmaceutical giants into whose web our Nancy Drew is drawn. Whilst the characters themselves aren't ones that will reach into your heart, even the main character with her Aussie charm and the tragic Rosaline with her childish fancies are slightly inaccessible, there is insight and poignancy to be found in the way in which elements of the plot unfold and are structured, within the connections revealed, and the juxtapositions made, it's symmetry and balance of events, like justice attained. The truth of their own monstrosity this family of corrupt individuals are ultimately forced to confront were also strongly emotive.I would absolutely recommend this book for an entertaining and unerringly thrilling read."}, {"userName": "Denise", "userReviewDate": "Jan 15, 2017", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/5863827-denise", "userReview": "In this book we follow Freya, a nurse hired to take care of the comatose son of a very rich and powerful family. Even though she is tasked with not asking questions, she can't help but try to investigate the strange things she encounters in their giant house. Things become especially urgent when some mysteries begin to point to problems from her own past.The good:I think Freya was great. She's flawed and interesting and willing to poke her nose where it doesn't belong - all basic requirements for the protagonist of a mystery novel. Her relationships to others also works well; we can see that underneath her snarky and self-destructive exterior is a person who really wants to help people, no matter how mean or crazy they may be. We can see why she wanted to be a nurse even though she is currently struggling with it.The mysteries were also really great. Some stuff we can see or guess early, some comes late - but even at the end, I think there's plenty of room for discussion on what 'really happened'. The not so great:A good portion of the side-characters seem rather one dimensional. 'evil asshole' is fun to witness, but I wished some of them had a little more depth.The ending didn't quite give me what I wanted- I got enough answers to be satisfied, but I think the character resolutions were a little pat.Verdict:Overall, a solid mystery and I would definitely read more from the author.NB: I did receive my copy from Netgalley for review, but my opinions, as always, are my own."}, {"userName": "Erin Triplett", "userReviewDate": "Feb 15, 2017", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/32057405-erin-triplett", "userReview": "I loved the humor in this book.

The main character, Freya, is a nurse who chances upon a unique, well-paid job: to care for the inexplicably comatose son of a wealthy, powerful family of corporate monsters. It's based in Brisbane, and Donellan includes the occasional cute nod to his favourite local hangouts. He's a fine writer, though he tends toward excessive verbosity, and some of the dialogue struck me as unrealistic. I suppose my main criticism is that none of the characters are likeable; they all have distinct flaws, which is no doubt part of Donellan's design, but it doesn't make the book an easy read."}, {"userName": "roxi Net", "userReviewDate": "Oct 28, 2016", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/29135665-roxi-net", "userReview": "I laughed from beginning to end with this book.
