Hardly has she managed to get one stashed into a comfortable spot before another one comes knocking. A wolf even arrives at her door, but his intentions are less than honorable, and the other animals band together to subdue him. Little Mole prepares some warm soup for her friends, and they even share a bowl with Wolf. Since he's a bit tied up to keep the rest of them safe, he must sip his through a straw. Young readers are sure to enjoy the idea of so many animals seeking shelter in one place as well as seeing how the smaller animals work together to keep safe from Wolf. The illustrations are bright and cheerful, and seem to be filled with just as much warmth as that soup."}], "description": "", "title": "Little Mole, Please Open the Door", "url": "http://www.goodreads.com/book/show/40285483-little-mole-please-open-the-door", "average": 3.0, "cover": "", "reviews": 1, "authors": [{"url": "https://www.goodreads.com/author/show/1268948.Orianne_Lallemand", "name": "Orianne Lallemand"}], "type": [], "outlinks": ["http://www.goodreads.com/book/show/40285483-little-mole-please-open-the-door", "http://www.goodreads.com/book/show/13020263-the-wolf-who-wanted-to-change-his-color", "http://www.goodreads.com/book/show/29902388-the-blue-bird-s-palace", "http://www.goodreads.com/book/show/17076653-the-wolf-who-wanted-to-travel-the-world", "http://www.goodreads.com/book/show/19391170-le-loup-qui-n-aimait-pas-no-l", "http://www.goodreads.com/book/show/16147076-le-loup-qui-ne-voulait-plus-marcher"]}
