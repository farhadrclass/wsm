You won my heart. I knew you would. Before I started this series, I was asked, out of the Three Blind Dates, who would I choose? The Suit, The Rebel, or The Jock. Not knowing any of them before reading the story, of course, I chose The Jock. He didn\u2019t win. I wasn\u2019t disappointed. I wasn\u2019t upset with how that story ended, I think it was perfect. And now I finally got my Jock\u2019s story. And again, Meghan Quinn you are a Fricken Rockstar Author. Your writing is flawless to me. I knew I\u2019d love Hayden\u2019s story, I had no doubts. What I didn\u2019t anticipate was what his story would entail. A professional NHL star. We not only had glimpses of him in Three Blind Dates but we got some of him in Back in the Game. He\u2019s sexy, he\u2019s complete sports celebrity worthy. He\u2019s not a guy that plays woman, he rather keeps to himself. He's seems to be about heart, and damn is he ever so very patient. Oh...And after having a horrible end to his rookie year, he wants time to himself. What he doesn\u2019t expect to find is his forever and a little bit more. Adalyn, we were gifted her as one of the best friends in My Best Friend\u2019s Ex. I loved her then and I begged for her story. And Amen, I got it and I loved it. In this story, she drove me crazy, yet I couldn't get enough of her. Placing myself in her position, I can see myself doing some of the same things she did to preserve her heart, so I am not going to say anything bad about her. In the end she did the right thing. She is spunky, she is fun, she is kind, she is faithful, and she is so very beautiful. And did I forget to say, she doesn't fall in love, she would rather have fun than to have her heart get broken. So when she finds herself falling for a guy visiting town, will she have fun with him, give him her heart, or will she walk away and break his heart. Hayden & Adalyn find themselves in a predicament. A rather predictable one from the title of this book. What we don't know, is how this plays out, what happens and how, and will these two people enamored with love find their happiness? Don't forget the hurt, the happiness, the sadness, the brokenness, and the towers of love this story holds. When you've waited your whole life to find someone that captures your attention, your heart, your whole being, how far will you go to keep it. How patient will you be to hold on to it? In the end, if you know me at all, when I love, I love with everything, and dammit Meghan Quinn, I really want more Hayden & Adalyn. These two make love so believableSo if you take anything from this review at all, Take this: Read this series. It is so amazingly good. This book can be read as a standalone but I encourage you to enjoy the whole series as it is all tied together. But not necessary to enjoy. Make sure to grab this one upon release!!"}, {"userName": "Patty Belongs To Kellan~Jesse~Lautner~Miller~Jack~Racer~Rafe~Liam~Prince Nicholas~Hayes~Simon~Gianluca & Archer", "userReviewDate": "May 18, 2018", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/14302918-patty-belongs-to-kellan-jesse-lautner-miller-jack-racer-rafe-liam-prince", "userReview": "*****FIVE STARS*****{ARC Generously Provided by Author}Her voice is meek with a hint of desperation, like she\u2019s been waiting all her life for this one kiss, for my lips to be pressed against hers. And for one of the first times in my life, I\u2019m scared. I\u2019m scared of what this kiss might do to me, of how it will change me as a man, because Adalyn isn\u2019t just any girl. She could be THE girl for any lucky son of a bitch. No doubt in my mind she\u2019s someone you only come across once in a lifetime, and fuck if I\u2019m not nervous to take the next step, to see if my gut reaction is right, that this girl is my game changer.Ever since \u201dThree Blind Dates\u201d, I\u2019ve been ANXIOUS to get my hands on Hayden\u2019s book! Most readers were in love with Beck, \"the rebel\" from \u201dTwo Wedding Crashers\u201d, but I\u2019ve always been a goner for a hot hockey player!! I was so crazy about him that I couldn\u2019t see the lack of chemistry between him and Noely in book one. However, I knew this man was something truly special and I think I might love his story the most out of this truly amazing series! Get ready for some gut-wrenching angst and make sure you have a box of Kleenex handy because I guarantee you, tears will be shed. This is by far the most angsty and heartfelt story in this trio of amazing books!The story takes place a little before the timeline in \u201dThree Blind Dates\u201d. Hayden is currently playing for the Philadelphia Brawler's who just lost their shot at the Stanley Cup playoffs. Feeling bummed and needing some time to himself, he decides to make a trip back to his old hometown of Binghamton, where he catches up with his old buddy from high school, Racer. Racer is still one of my top favorite heroes created by Meghan Quinn and he's as funny as ever in this story. While at Racer\u2019s house for a \u201cwelcome home\u201d party, Hayden runs into Adalyn and is instantly knocked off his ass. We met Adalyn in \u201dMy Best Friend\u2019s Ex\u201d, she is Emma\u2019s close friend from nursing school. Adalyn and Racer became really good friends and he feels overly protective of her, and so he warns Hayden to stay away from her. But his warning only ignites Hayden\u2019s interest that much more.Soon enough Hayden and Adalyn start secretly spending time together since they don\u2019t want to deal with Racer\u2019s wrath. It\u2019s a slow and torturous burn between them as Hayden is the one who delays anything sexual happening between them. He's really crazy about Adalyn and wants to take things slow so that whatever is building between them will last a lifetime. Adalyn is the problem in this coupling. One thing about Meghan Quinn\u2019s heroines, you either LOVE them or HATE them, and I was leaning towards a strong dislike to hatred for Adalyn. She\u2019s never really had a relationship with a man because she hasn\u2019t stayed with one long enough to see how things could work out. It was clear from day one that Hayden wasn\u2019t like any of the other guys she\u2019s been with. Her fears were completely baseless. It took an eternity before they became intimate but holy hell was it sure worth the wait!! Just when things seem to be going perfectly for them, the couple is torn apart and I blame Adalyn for all of it. After she finds out that she\u2019s pregnant I end up disliking her, even more, when she decides to keep the news from Hayden.There\u2019s a tremendous amount of angst and drama when Adalyn\u2019s close friend, Logan, is added to the mix. Logan is always there to support Adalyn and from day one, Hayden has despised him. Will another man and thousands of miles between them, doom Hayden and Adalyn\u2019s relationship forever?This book was INCREDIBLE in my opinion. I loved the plot, the steam, and most of all I fell head over heels more in love with Hayden. He made this book a \u201cFive Star\u201d read for me. Even though I don\u2019t think Adalyn was good enough for him and I wanted to throw my iPad against the wall because of her, I couldn\u2019t help but be consumed by this book!Here are my overall ratings\nHero:\n 5+++++\nHeroine:\n 3\nPlot:\n 5\nAngst:\n5\nSteam:\n 5\nChemistry Between Hero & Heroine:\n 5ONE BABY DADDY is currently available and DEFINITELY worth a one-click!

Coming off an abrupt end to his season, he wants nothing more than to forget about the dramatic season-ending game and get lost. So he returns to his hometown, Binghamton, New York for some relaxation, never expecting to meet a fiery yet funny nurse who takes his breath away. They spend the summer getting to know each other with the expectation that when summer is over, he will be heading back to Philadelphia and even with Hayden's reassurance that they will still be together, Adalyn has her doubts. And she was right, because with one life-alternating phone call, a massive bump in the road is firmly planted in front of them--and I'm not talking about a baby bump.

She ended up being a problem for me and her actions REALLY pissed me off. Maybe if I didn't have children... maybe if I wasn't a single working mother... maybe if I didn't identify with her situation I wouldn't feel the way I did, but I do, I am, and I did.Getting pregnant takes two. That is correct. But keeping said pregnancy knowledge away from one of the parties is freaking selfish. It's cruel. It's rude. And it's freaking SELFISH!! Especially when the wronged party did nothing to deserve being the wronged party. I can understand if the soon-to-be father is an addict, is abusive, or carries some other traits that makes them an undesired potential co-parent. I get that. But Hayden was definitely not a candidate for worst dad of the century. He was sooooo good. To be left in the dark was disrespectful. So yeah, in the end I hated Adalyn. Because even after Hayden found out about the pregnancy, through no help from her, she still treated him like crap. He wanted to be there for her, to care for her, and she treated him as if he were repugnant. WTH???!!! By the end of the story, she didn't redeem herself enough for me. I still hated her and loved him.

There he meets Adalyn. They hit it off instantly and I was rooting for them at the beginning. I loved their relationship and their banter. Hayden is one of my favorite H's of all time. He's so loyal, sexy, patient and a true gentleman. He treats Adalyn with so much respect and tenderness, my heart melted. I wish I could find a guy just like him. I have to say Adalyn in the end kinda ruined this book for me. I really liked her up until 50%. Then she gave up on Hayden cause he got traded and basically didn't want to try and make their relationship work, even when Hayden was 100% in. She didn't want to know anything about him and wanted to hide her pregnancy from him. That is not ok, specially when Hayden's always been a gentleman and a good guy. I just couldn't understand Adalyn's hesitation and how she hurt Hayden. Also her relationship with Logan was a big no no for me. She frustrated me and in the end I just feel she didn\u2019t deserve Hayden. Overall this book was okay for me.

And the inclusion of some of my other FAVORITE male leads in her previous novels? So. Freaking. Good. I loved this book. I read it in ONE sitting from start to finish. I fell head over heels in love, and cannot stop THINKING about this amazing male lead. Friends, you DON'T want to miss out on Hayden's book. He is absolutely swoon worthy and his female counterpart? Just as superbly written as he is. Man. I am trying not to gush but this book delivered in so many ways. So, what will you get when you dive into One Baby Daddy? A captivating love story with a bit of slow burn. The hero is a pro hockey player who, upon returning to the town of Binghampton, meets the one woman he KNOWS is going to change his heart. Is it love at first sight? Maybe. But he is going to take his time and make sure that everything goes perfectly. Unfortunately, forgetting ones birth control can put a damper on things... And some unsaid words and feelings will change these two in more ways than one. Readers, you NEED to read Hayden and Adalyn's powerful love story! I loved every single second of it and want to immediately dive right back in the series from the beginning so I can experience it all over again. These characters are everything one hopes to read about in a romance novel and have the best personalities around. Obviously, I very highly recommend this book as well as the others in the series. Haven't read the series yet? I suggest starting from the beginning even though each book features a different couple. I think you will have a better understanding as to how the series came about if you do so.

He made me laugh. He made me swoon! I just loved this sexy jock with a heart of gold.Hayden and Adalyn connect with each other through a common friend, Racer from Twisted Twosome. These two hit it off right away and have a great few weeks together enjoying each others company. Despite the instant attraction, these two take their time getting to know each other. Hayden senses that there is something special about Adalyn and he doesn't want to ruin their relationship by getting physical too early. Adalyn is a very spunky heroine. She is strong and independent and is not afraid to tell it like it is. She has never had a real committed relationship before and she lets her fear of failing at love get in the way of taking a chance with Hayden. She makes some questionable decisions that made me want to wring her neck but it all worked out in the end. Hayden really stepped up his game in the last third of the book. His commitment to win over Adalyn was so sweet! He was so thoughtful and considerate. He just about melted my heart! Let me just talk about all the cameos for a sec. We get to see Racer and Tucker from the Binghamtom series and of course Racer is his usual crazy self. We also see Noely from Three Blind Dates and we get to see the date she had with Hayden from his point of view and oh my gosh, it's even funnier. Adalyn also meets Calder, Hayden's teammate, from Back in the Game. It was so much fun to see them all together in this book. You can definitely read this as a standalone but I think it would be so much better if you at least read Three Blind Dates first. This was a great way to end this series.

Hayden and Adalyn can't get enough of each other, but like with all romances, things take a drastic turn.You all may be wondering why the rating was so low and it wasn't because I didn't like the story; the story was sweet, charming, and emotional. I just didn't feel much of a connection to Adalyn and their was just some moments that had me second guessing where the story would go at one point.This one may not have been my cup of tea, but I will continue reading Meghan Quinn's books.

When he didn\u2019t end up getting the girl in Three Blind Dates, I was low key bummed about it but I knew Meghan Quinn would pull through and give Hayden the happily-ever-after he deserved\u2026or at least I hoped she would. *crosses fingers* After losing his cool on the ice and costing his team a shot at the championship, Hayden Holmes decides to head up to Binghamton to get away from the media and to clear his head. There he meets Adalyn, a sassy nurse who isn\u2019t used to commitment, but there\u2019s something about the charming hockey player that has Adalyn wanting more. Hayden and Adalyn end up falling fast and hard for each other, but when Hayden gets traded to another team, Adalyn decides that it would be best to break things off before anyone gets hurt. But a clean break isn\u2019t going to work in her favor this time around\u2014not with an unexpected surprise on the way.When I found out that Adalyn was going to be Hayden\u2019s love interest, I was hyped because that meant we were going to be seeing some of my favorite characters from the Binghamton series again! At the same time, I wasn\u2019t quite sure what to expect because Hayden and Adalyn have very opposite personalities so I was curious to see how things would end up playing out for them. The overall plot was entertaining and while surprise pregnancies can be a hit or miss trope, it worked for me in this book. Y\u2019all are definitely going to need some patience going into this one because holy shit this was such an angsty, slow-burning romance. There were numerous obstacles these two had to work through, but the wait is so worth it in the end.HAYDEN HOLMES IS MY NEW BOOK HUSBAND! I just want all y\u2019all out there to know that Hayden has been claimed for so hands off! But in all seriousness, Hayden is definitely my favorite hero in this series. He\u2019s just genuinely a good guy with a lot of patience and I loved the fact that he never pushed Adalyn to be with him. He just gave her straight facts and he let her decide whether or not she was willing to take a chance on him. Adalyn was a bit of a surprise because when we first met her in My Best Friend\u2019s Ex, she came off as this confident, go-luck girl who just wanted to have a good time. But in One Baby Daddy, we got to peel back her layers and see that she does have some insecurities and that just made her more relatable. I honestly couldn\u2019t get enough of these two together and I didn\u2019t want their story to end.One Baby Daddy was the perfect ending to the Dating by Numbers series and Meghan Quinn definitely knew what she was doing when she saved the best story for last! If you haven\u2019t picked up this series yet, then you definitely need to change that ASAP because this series is so freakin\u2019 good and no one writes rom-coms better than Meghan Quinn!

In the first half of the book, I enjoyed seeing her open up and move forward with Hayden. The last half of the book, I wanted to throat punch her. I was seriously perturbed with this woman. Like, pissed the heck off at the decisions she made. While I could rationalize a few of them based on her history with men, her naivety ended up being just a tad too much for me. And don't even get me started on her ex/best friend. Ugh!I also struggled a bit with the direction of the story. It was not at all what I expected. Yea, that's probably on me, so I won't ding the book too much for it.

But boy I had no idea how much emotion this one would pull from me.Adalyn was so sweet in the beginning but I really hated her attitude at times. Okay, yes she'd never been in a relationship before, yes long distance relationships aren't easy... but Hayden deserved better than what she put him through, unnecessarily may I had. She really made me mad, she kept hurting my sweet baby and it broke my heart to see him in pain.The first half of the book was pretty perfect. I loved watching Hayden pursue her and fall in love with her but then he's traded and everything in his life falls apart including the close-to-perfect relationship he had been building with Adalyn. She doesn't believe in a long distance relationship, much less one with a famous hockey player. And to add to the chaos, she discovers something that will change their lives forever at the time all this is going on.And that's the moment she starts pissing me off. I love it when a guy has to fight to get the girl, but she not only made it hard, she made it hurt as well. And that sucked for him, and for me as a reader because it was obvious how much Hayden loved her and was happy about the baby and she was just so stupid and blind and kept on hurting him over and over, and that really hurt to read. I just wanted him to finally FINALLY get his happy ending. After two books he darn well deserved it and so did I lol. The surprise chapter in the midst of the book scared me half to death. At a certain moment, I thought that he wouldn't get his HEA in his own darn book but thank god, it was just another bump in their long road.I'm sorry this review sucks. I swear this book made me crazy! I mean I love when books mess with my emotions but this one pulled emotions I don't particularly appreciate. I felt such empathy for Hayden, it was just really hard to read the unfairness of his situation. He was like the perfect guy, like complete full package, he was pretty transparent about his emotions too, only a blind person couldn't see (aka Adalyn). He seriously did not deserve what he was put through and it was something that could have been controlled, she had complete control of the situation and she really made the wrong choices. Yes it was her choice but she should have taken Hayden's rights into consideration and she didn't, she let her fears rule over every single possible outcome of their situation and I hated that. While she started the book as a pretty sweet and cool girl, she changed her tune when the going got tough and I lost all admiration for her at that point. Even though I still very much wanted him to get his girl, and rooted for things to work out, it just didn't feel right. I wanted better for Hayden, I really did. But anyway... my emotions are pretty clear on this book. I love Hayden way too much and I was kind of disappointed with Adalyn. Their story was a long journey and a complete roller coaster ride. It started way high and then dropped down low in a flash. It will probably frustrate you too but it's definitely worth a read. Mainly because it's Hayden, duh!

The moment Hayden and Adalyn first met already had me giggling like a school girl. Hayden is a professional hockey player who recently had a blow out on the ice, benched and as a result his team lost the Stanley Cup. Hayden got nothing to do but escape and brooding for a while. Hayden and Adalyn have a mutual friend Racer. During a get together at Racer\u2019s house Adalyn caught Hayden snooping around \u2013 she called him out on it and so the back and forth balls-busting begins. I like that the hero and heroine is relatable. I absolutely adore Hayden \u2013 popular, sexy, talented but there is something charming, humble about him. He is not a typical jock, but rather a gentleman when it comes to dating and relationship. Don\u2019t get me wrong Hayden is not immune to lust but it is important for him to have a deep love connection before hopping in bed with the woman. Like I said the man is totally swoon-worthy. Adalyn is a more forward one in this relationship. She is bold, sassy, a ball buster. Adalyn knows what she wants and is not afraid to go after it \u2013 and she wants Hayden!!! With Hayden waiting patiently for the perfect moment to make a move \u2013 you can guess the sexual tension is off the chart. I do enjoy how their relationship progress \u2013 friends to lovers, slow building, sensual yet sexy. There are of course speed bumps on the way to HEA (you can guess by the title of the book) among other things (Adalyn\u2019s ex-boyfriend) which make the story more interesting. There is also Racer \u2013 an overprotective friend. I got to be honest I was a bit weird out with how protective he is over Adalyn knowing that Hayden is a great guy. For a moment, I was not sure where that relationship was going. Not to worry \u2013 no love triangle here\u2026Over all, Hayden and Adalyn love story is adorable. Amazing chemistry, hilarious banters, very typical of Meghan\u2019s writing. Another sweet rom-com you don\u2019t want to miss. 4.5 Stars"}, {"userName": "Heather C", "userReviewDate": "May 17, 2018", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/3808873-heather-c", "userReview": "One thing that is always consistent with a Meghan Quinn book is that I get so easily wrapped up into everything. Whether I\u2019m falling in love with someone or despising them, it doesn\u2019t matter. What matters is that I feel some kind of emotion towards them. Fair warning, my review is basically loving on Hayden. I just can\u2019t help it.One Baby Daddy is sweet, sexy and funny. One beautiful package that keeps you engaged from start to finish. I can honestly say that I liked every single person in this story, including the one that I know a lot of people are going to hate.I hate to compare books and/or characters because I think each author deserves the recognition for their hard work. However, I\u2019m going to compare Hayden Holmes to someone only because it shows how much I love him. Truth\u2026I don\u2019t really fall for the sweet guys. Most of the time, I\u2019m indifferent to them. Sure, I\u2019ll do a quick \u201caww\u201d at some things but I don\u2019t usually fall for them. My first love with a sweetheart was Brody Murphy in Room For You. He\u2019s also a hockey player like Hayden so I\u2019m being real when I tell you that I compare the two. Both are swoon worthy with the biggest hearts on the planets. It\u2019s been almost four years since I fell in love with Brody and Hayden from One Baby Daddy has me questioning my loyalty. I\u2019m now one of those girls you read about who has fallen in love with two men and is absolutely torn. The girl that you want to scream at and make them pick a side. Hayden Holmes stole a piece of my heart reserved for someone else and I swear to you, that is the biggest compliment I could give.If you like sports romance with a swoon worthy, to die for hero who will sweep you off your feet and melt your heart, then you need to get One Baby Daddy. It has wit, banter, a bit of drama and a whole lotta love. Well done, Meghan.

I loved his approach toward Adalyn and their impending romance. Loved their slow burn. Loved how he built up that anticipation with every look and touch. Seriously swooning in my seat while I was reading. And Adalyn is equally amazing. She\u2019s strong willed, smart, sexy and can keep Hayden and the rest of the Brawlers and Hayden\u2019s brothers in check. Okay, equally amazing until I wanted to reach inside my Kindle a couple times to choke her . . . err . . . try to talk some sense into her. I loved how One Baby Daddy overlapped with the timeline of Three Blind Dates and Back in the Game. I loved Hayden and Adalyn as a couple. They are truly perfect for each other.

When I found out he would be part of her new series, I was so excited. Then I had to wait. She tortured me, forcing me to be patient for Hayden, but, boy, is he worth it. Hayden is absolutely everything I wanted, and I know I\u2019ve said it before here it comes again. HAYDEN IS MY FAVORITE MEGAHN QUINN HERO!Hayden is a freaking dream, and not your typical athletic hero. This man has the athletic stamina and confidence of the athlete, but his heart and desire for love is abnormal for this genre and what will make readers love him. His desire for something real and his need to connect to Adalyn emotionally is so romantic. Every time he surprises her and every discussion between them had me swooning hard for this man, just absolutely dead. It is a wonder any woman could resist his charm and wooing.Adalyn I love for most of the book. She is witty and fiesty, and I adore how she goes with the flow no matter how awkward and crazy a situation can get. Her banter and joking with Hayden makes her incredibly endearing. She has some fears, though, about her worth and a relationship, which affects her decision making, and while I understand it, it is incredibly frustrating. So many times I wanted to reach into my kindle and shake her, scream how can you not see what is happening. Her choices make me want to scream, especially because it stems from fear. Now, rationally and in regards to character development, her behavior is expected and true to the woman Meghan Quinn has developed her to be. It just makes me crazy. Adalyn gets it together, though, finally, and she really is so perfect for Hayden.There is also a host of secondary characters who steal the show. It was so much fun to see returning characters from her previous series, especially since stories overlap a bit. Plus, we get a host of new characters, and it may be a bit of wishful thinking but I need the Holmes brothers to have stories. This story is epitome of a slow burn. Heck, Hayden had me sexually frustrated in this book, so I fully understand Adalyn\u2019s need to jump his bones. He has everyone riled up with his charisma and teasing. They pay off and Hayden are absolutely worth he wait though, and their chemistry outside of the bedroom is so electric that readers won\u2019t miss the lack of intimate bedroom moments. Readers will see the conflict coming, and I expect they will be frustrated be the naivety of one of the characters. In the end, it all works out, and the hero an heroine get their HEA. One Baby Daddy is certainly worth the wait. Meghan Quinn delivers her signature sense of humor with a steamy and swoon worthy romance. I couldn\u2019t put it down, and Hayden and Adalyn will be firmly sitting in my must read pile. It is romantic comedy perfection.

Heading to his childhood hometown to visit his best friend Racer, he didn\u2019t even imagine meeting someone like Adalyn. She\u2019s adventurous, sassy and isn\u2019t impressed with his new star rookie status. He finds her a refreshing change and their budding relationship might be the start of something good until the unexpected happens. After spending the best off-season ever together, Hayden and Adalyn need to figure out how to go on alone. Until Adalyn ends up pregnant and Hayden\u2019s thrown a curve.\u201cHe makes me feel so\u2026brand new. Like he\u2019s awakened a part of me I\u2019ve never known before. He\u2019s introduced me to a personality I didn\u2019t know existed within me. Someone who can be content, thrilled, exhilarated all at the same time. A woman who doesn\u2019t necessarily depend on a man, but allows him to take care of her because he treasures her. Someone who doesn\u2019t need to shed her clothes to get a man to like her.\u201dWow! I don\u2019t typically like baby daddy stories but I loved this book! I really think it all has to do with this world that Meghan has created and sucked me into. I fell in love with Hayden in Three Blind Dates and Back in the Game. I met Adalyn in the Binghamton series and these worlds collided hard! Both Hayden and Adalyn were such likeable characters with Adalyn being rather gun shy. And who could blame her? If I had been burnt like she had been\u2026I would have felt the same exact way. But Hayden\u2026that man! I would say out of all of the perfect men in these series he may be one of the best men I have ever read. He TREASURED Adalyn. His goal was to be a man that would be worthy of her. I was swooning left and right. Pick me up off the floor and find the place I left off reading. Their love story is such a slow burn since they just aren\u2019t in the same place. But it really picks up once the baby situation comes to light. And let\u2019s not forget about Logan! He\u2019s her friend who maybe wants to step out of the friend zone. It really creates some crazy tension in the last part of the book. Can he compete with Hayden, the complete package, for Adalyn\u2019s heart?I feel like I have this addiction for all of these romantic comedies. I laugh and then swoon and then get upset and then completely fall for every single couple in these series.

What he doesn\u2019t expect is to meet a woman on his first night in town that intrigues him like no other woman has before.Even after graduating and becoming a nurse Adalyn still finds herself at house parties with her friends where she often ends up patching someone up, but when she catches a man snooping in her friend Racer\u2019s personal business she wastes no time confronting him only to find him charming and irresistible. As someone who has read almost all of Ms. Quinn\u2019s books, I\u2019m going to admit that I spent a good deal of the beginning of this book confused because its timeline begins before already published books therefore circumstances with supporting characters are different. In fact I found myself going back to those other books because I thought maybe I was reading out of order, but alas that\u2019s not the case. The other books, take place during this book and thus my confusion.Hayden and Adalyn meet at a party and enjoy the evening talking and getting to know one another despite his friend\u2019s warning to stay away from Adalyn because she doesn\u2019t need someone who is only going to be around for a short time, Hayden tracks her down and they embark on a sweet friendship that turns to more. I enjoyed the beginning of their relationship and the fact that Hayden was determined to make this different from any relationship he had before and prove to Adalyn she was special in his eyes. I felt like Adalyn was never fully in and she proved it over and over and I hate the way she treated Hayden for a large majority of this book. I wanted more for him, I wanted someone who realized what a good man he was, and appreciated every little thing about him and honestly I didn\u2019t feel like Adalyn was worthy of his love. I don\u2019t believe that someone with her background was na\u00efve enough to believe her \u201cfriend\u201d Logan did everything he did out of the goodness of his heart and I hate that she blamed Hayden for circumstances that were totally out of his control. I\u2019m not a fan of unnecessary drama and sadly this book was full of it. That being said, I was happy with the ending, but it was a chore getting to the end. The hero and his goodness is what made this book worth reading and while I accept the outcome, in my heart I still feel he deserves a better partner. Sometimes an author whose work you adore offers up a book that doesn\u2019t work completely for you and that is the case with One Baby Daddy and me, that doesn\u2019t mean it won\u2019t appeal to others but for me it was too angst filled and not enough relationship development for me to love it."}], "description": "\"What are you doing now that your team is out of the running for the Stanley Cup?\"Forget.I need to forget.
