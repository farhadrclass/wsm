Her second installment of the series is full of action from the first chapter again. Cash is still the tough, Iowa girl, trying to help solve problems in a zombie apocalypse world. Her contribution to the camp is invaluable. She is always there to save the day. Clutch was broody and a tad less likeable in this book. I understand his frustration to get better and contribute, but his broodiness was slap worthy. Cash should have smacked him around.

This after the mayhem that closed out the first book and wiped out Camp Fox, the National Guard base where most survivors in the area had migrated to after the dead rose. Clutch is still alive, but working on learning how to walk again after the injuries he suffered in the mayhem at the end of 100DiD. The survivors are fewer, but the human dangers from the first book are no more, making the undead once again their main concern. On a mission to save a group of refugees stuck in a building surrounded by zeds, Cash and Clutch discover that there are hordes of the undead roaming the countryside, moving south toward their current safe haven. After flying a surveillance mission it becomes clear to Cash that these hordes are massive, with tens of thousands, if not hundreds of thousands of the undead in them and they are wiping out everything in their path. Nothing remains except rubble and desolation. And soon they will trample the park and anyone who remains there. The survivors make a decision to seek the assistance of a riverboat captain, who has taken on other survivors on his boat that floats on the Mississippi river, out of clutching grasp of the zeds. This leads to new complications and more human conflicts as the two groups struggle to coexist with one another while at the same time the hordes continue to advance on their position.Deadland\u2019s Harvest maintains the fast pace of its predecessor and the narration has a natural flow and feel to it. While Cash has become a seasoned survivor who has been hardened by the trauma she faced in the first book, she has formed a family bond with Clutch and Jace, and will do anything to keep them safe. While this story is told in first person, the author manages to continue to let the secondary characters tell their own tale and grow as the story progresses. Avoiding many of the pitfalls that challenge the middle book in a trilogy, Deadland\u2019s Harvest does a solid job of standing on its own, though with an intriguing promise of what is to come in the final act in this three part saga.Kudos to the author for using the idea of massive hordes of the undead moving and migrating together, like other creatures who are avoiding the cold of winter. I do wish there was greater detail on the hordes shared, as the concept was an intriguing one. Also intriguing is the theme the author has carried over from the first book, which is to use Dante Aligheri\u2019s works to set the stage for her story. 100DiD traversed the nine circles of hell while DH examines the seven deadly sins. The final book promised to explore the seven virtues. The reader need not know anything further about Dante to appreciate the story, just the fact that this is a solid zombie action tale."}, {"userName": "Sue Moro", "userReviewDate": "Sep 18, 2013", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/4677076-sue-moro", "userReview": "Deadland's Harvest*I received a free copy of this book from the author in exchange for an honest review.One hundred days have past since Cash met Clutch while the world around them dissolved into a zombie infested nightmare. As the book begins, the two are at Camp Fox, along with forty-two other survivors, as they recover from the injuries they incurred at the end of 100 Days in Deadland. Clutch is struggling to walk again after severely injuring his back. Having previously suffered PTSD while in the service, Clutch has retreated into himself. Cash, while supportive, wisely gives him space and time and hopes the man she is falling in love with will return to her.Cash has become a valued team member at the camp. She has developed into an an expert shot, and she is also a pilot able to fly small aircraft to scout out the surrounding territory. While out on a run she discovers several massive herds of zombies (zeds) heading south and Camp Fox lies directly in their path!It is imperative that the camp be relocated, but with the herds spread out so far, there isn't enough time to move all of their supplies and live stock around and past before they are upon them. Bargaining with another local group of survivors, they move to barges out on the water and hopefully out of the zeds reach. The members of Camp Fox will soon face many challenges as trouble comes at them in both dead and undead form, and winter is just around the corner. Oh, the feels in this book! No one is safe in this series which keeps the reader on edge and constantly surprised. Danger is around every corner from both the living and the dead, and it makes for compelling reading. The characters are what truly make this series so special. Cash is wonderful and I love that the story is told from her POV. It's so nice for a change to see a female lead character develop into a strong and brave fighter. Deadland's Harvest is a great sequel! No middle book syndrome here! I absolutely loved the idea of the zed herds driven by some unknown instinct to migrate south for the winter. In 100 Days in Deadland, Ms. Aukes wove the story around the nine levels of Hell encountered in Dante's Inferno, with Clutch acting as Cash's guide through a nightmare world. Once again returning to the Divine Comedy for inspiration, Ms. Aukes ingeniously utilizes the seven sins from Purgatory to build her story upon. The sequel will focus on the virtues of Paradise and hopefully the survivors will rediscover their humanity."}, {"userName": "AudioBookReviewer", "userReviewDate": "Oct 14, 2015", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/7365795-audiobookreviewer", "userReview": "ABR's original Deadland\u2019s Harvest audiobook review and many others can be found at Audiobook Reviewer.100 days ago, zombies consumed most of the living population with the exception of pockets of survivors.

Cash, Klutch and Jayse are the main characters that discover there are herds of zombies \u2013 tens of thousands \u2013 headed straight toward their home in Fox National Park. In a leap of faith, a fellow colony of survivors is contacted and they generously share the broken and abandoned barges and other boats in their area. The downside is the group must repair them, stock them and move their colony there in under two weeks. Although their plans are set and they have contingency plans \u2013 Aukes throws in several twists that have the listener cautioning the characters knowing that things are not as they seem (nothing like yelling \u201cdon\u2019t go in there\u201d while driving solo in a car!). Aukes does an excellent job of bringing in the seven deadly sins and using the zombies and their situation to demonstrate them.Well written, character developments were strong and made one gasp when their situation was revealed. I was confused for a few minutes \u2013 it was not apparent, as I did not read book 1) that the zombie apocalypse occurred 100 days ago \u2013 so I was struggling to figure out why there were so many shortages. One example of Aukes clever writing and playing on emotions \u2013 she has a 10 year old boy with downs syndrome talking down a vengeful father hell bent on revenge. In his innocence, he prevents bloodshed.Hollie Jackson narrated the book; she did an excellent job with voices and reading concisely. Her energy level helped keep the realness present.

Picking up where the first book left off, Aukes continues to build upon her post-apocalyptic world, using the seven deadly sins to propel the story, while once again telling it in first-person voice through Cash\u2019s eyes. In order to have the best reader experience, it is best to read the Deadland Saga in order.Cash and Clutch are recovering from the injuries they suffered at the end of the first book, and it takes them awhile to be physically able to fight the Zebs (Zombies) again. With Clutch\u2019s injuries being more severe, Cash realizes that she needs to be patient with him because his personality has been affected too, which I adored about her. Cash is a thoroughly entertaining character because she really is a survivor. I\u2019d like to think that I would be strong like Cash is in facing the Zebs. I also loved that she is a straight shooter, just telling it like it is. Currently, the Zebs have started to travel in herds, migrating south for the winter. Unfortunately, Camp Fox is in the direct path of the herd, which forces their camp leader to trust another survivor group for help, all the while hoping that they\u2019ll not be betrayed in the process. Aukes does a wonderful job of balancing the characters\u2019 emotional growth while also keeping the characters feeling like real people in the harsh world that they are living in now. The pulse-pounding fight scenes with the Zebs along with the stunning, and at times, heartbreaking plot twists keep the pages flying by right up to the stunning conclusion.Once again, I was completely captivated by Cash, Clutch, and the other survivors as well as their battles with the Zebs\u2014I read Deadland\u2019s Harvest in one sitting!

There are so many specific things I\u2019d like to discuss, but instead of giving too many details, I will just tell you why this series is so freaking awesome.Deadland\u2019s Harvest is rich with character development, which kept me fully engaged from beginning to end. It\u2019s impossible not to care deeply about the characters\u2019 outcome. Cash is freaking badass. I love her to pieces. She\u2019s grown so much since the beginning of the first book. She feels like a real person to me after this much involvement in her story.There are wonderful glimpses of hope sprinkled throughout the story\u2026 and then pulled out from under you, of course. The great thing about that is the story is so well written I was never left feeling hopeless. I spent most of the book rooting for Cash and.. well, for the rest of the gang. Ooh, see, I almost wrote something that wouldn\u2019t be good for newcomers! The simmering build up just before the action scenes is enough to make even the most seasoned zombie fanatics want to scream from the anxiety.

Some people may not respond well to your reaction.Deadland\u2019s Harvest is filled with super awesome zombie goodness and characters that will make you love them (or hate them).

You have to give yourself a pep talk, promising yourself it will get better, because who wants to waste their time and money for more disappointment? With Deadland\u2019s Harvest by Rachel Aukes, the only pep talk that I had with myself was, \u201cYou really have to put this book down sometime.\u201d Deadland\u2019s Harvest (book 2 of the Deadland Saga) was a grand slam, and I\u2019m looking forward to book 3. Cash, Clutch and Jase are back and they are still learning to survive in this new world of the dead. They are saving lives and keeping the human race from becoming extinct in their own corner of hell.There are no super hero\u2019s, no Hollywood one-man-army kind of characters. Everyone is learning to rely on one another while they hone their survival skills. They become a troop. Some have military experience, some are simply learning as they go. What I liked about Deadland\u2019s Harvest is that there is gritty realism to the characters and the plot. Now, for the not so good news: I didn\u2019t understand why at 406 pages we couldn\u2019t see Clutch and Cash\u2019s relationships continue to develop. Although Jase got more \u201cscreen time\u201d he still is a bit of mystery; his character seems to be on the cusp of being fully developed but it isn\u2019t quite there yet.There are a lot of action scenes. The first few chapters start out a little slow, but once the pacing gets going it comes at you at full tilt until the ending. I really like these characters and the world that Rachel Aukes as created for us with this series.

So you can imagine how excited I was when I got a digital copy of Deadland's Harvest for review.And this book is awesome!Aukes uses the seven deadly sins as a guideline for her story, but in such a way that it doesn't interfere with your reading pleasure. You can easily identify the sins in each part of the story, but the things that are happening, the action, and zombie mayhem make sure you are totally engrossed in the story. The story starts where 100 Days in Deadland ended, and with only a small reprieve Cash and her friends are once again caught up in the horrors of the zombie apocalypse. The story is intense and full of action. Zombies, greedy humans and more make surviving difficult. There's lots of death and destruction going on, and Cash and those close to her have to fight for survival. I was hooked from the start and had trouble putting the book down. I had to keep reading to find out what would happen next.Aukes doesn't pull any punches and there were some gruesome scenes and deaths that shocked me. I can say I was glad that most of my favorite characters survived, although not without wear and tear.

According to another surviving faction, the zombies are migrating south and are on a collision course for Cash's home.

I find her writing style to be straightforward and clean, she doesn't bore me with any lengthy descriptions and there is very few moments of rest for her characters. Translation: Deadland's Harvest is truly a great piece of fiction with non-stop action.Her characters are well fleshed out and there is distinct progression shown in each one. Clutch has been transformed from a ruthless, uncaring soldier into a compassionate man in love, protecting Cash, Jace, and the inhabitants of his small community. He's got a new vulnerability that makes him a much more likable character rather than just a bad boy.For me, the shining moments in this already stellar book, were those including Benji, a boy with Downs Syndrome. I've really got to hand it to Aukes for portraying his character so skillfully. It had the potential to come off stereotypical or callous, but instead, she did this sweet boy justice and he is an inspiring part of the story.Just like the first book in the series, 100 Days in Deadland, Deadland's Harvest has earned five stars from The Bookie Monster, and I am excited to see how this story concludes in the third and final book, Deadland Rising."}, {"userName": "Adam Geise", "userReviewDate": "Jan 11, 2014", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/22614077-adam-geise", "userReview": "I want to give this 3 1/2 but my phone hates me today. I was really looking forward to this continuation of the deadland saga. The first book was great. This book was good. There were a couple things that detract from a higher rating and an overall better book. It seems that the first book was edited better or had more feedback. There are multiple references in this book to the survivors getting all their supplies from Doyle's camp. After the first refresher I didn't need to read it 2 more times. This occurs again later on the subject of there not being small talk. The two sentences, chapters apart arte so similar I thought it was an error. In the last quarter of the book it is pointed put that Cash had never heard Clutch pray before when he does, then in the final chapters it happens again. Maybe I'm nit picking but a little more time with the editor would help this book tremendously.The positives. Rachel Aukes uses the footprint again in a great way, only tweaking the story to fit here and there. It was fun to find the similarities in each section. The characters are written well. I think in the first book a more personal connection was built. The \"bad guys\" are bad but never have the same ominous feel as Doyle's Dogs. Not spoiling the end I can see some being a bigger problem later. I enjoyed this, but not quite as much as the first. I will still buy the third book to see how the story ends.

Often times it felt very rushed and like some stories weren't fleshed out enough. Everyone outside the main trio felt completely expendable. Which essentially they are, but it made caring about these characters impossible and ultimately is what led to me being less invested in this book. I was excited about the 7 deadly sins aspect but in the end it felt too forced. The first book's tie in to Inferno felt seamless and natural. There was a lot of good action (at times it even felt like too much, though), and more than a few moments that had me up reading well past my bed time. A few times I even carried the fear in the book into my own world. Suddenly finding myself nervous going to the bathroom in the dark of night...

It's a war story, it's mostly a survival story, unemotional yet emotional, defeating and undefeated. You can't take it with you but you sure as hell can carry it a long way. There was plenty of filler in Deadland's Harvest, characters streaming in and getting killed. There's also plenty of explosions and fires, gunfire exchanges, knifings and machete decapitations, blood-letting and anger and frustration and more killing but not viewed as killing but viewed as survival of the fittest.Deadland's Harvest? Yeah, loved it. There were few spelling and syntax errors, but still, some line editing was needed to eliminate unnecessary dead words like very, just, suddenly, like, almost, hear, began and a few more. Overall the Harvest kept my interest. If you like zombies you'll like Deadland's Harvest."}, {"userName": "Passion1kiss", "userReviewDate": "Apr 29, 2014", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/30404546-passion1kiss", "userReview": "I was given this book to read in exchange for an honest review.The author's work paralleling Dante\u2019s \u201cPurgatorio\u201d with zombies, yet again, subtle, was genius. \u201cDeadland's Harvest\" picks up after \u201c100 Days in Deadland\u201d and dives right back in as Clutch, Cash and Jase emerged from their own (Hell). Each begin to deal with their own demons both physically and/or mentally as they prepare to take on protecting what was left of Camp Fox. Along with the other survivors they must battle the (migrating herds) of zeds. Here, they will be guilty of the (seven deadly sins) as they fight the battle of right vs. wrong as any way necessary in surviving both dead and undead. Decisions will be made. Lives will be lost.It is full of action to go around, lots of gore, but still has very well-developed characters. Details were the key. Overall, a really good read for the 2nd book of it series."}, {"userName": "Sarah (blissbubbley)", "userReviewDate": "Jun 01, 2014", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/4955127-sarah-blissbubbley", "userReview": "You might remember when I raved about the first book in this saga and now I am back telling you to read Book 2!Starting right off from where the last book ended we're back with Cash - have I mentioned that I love her character in the other review enough? They are still fighting against the zombies and making decisions that could change their futures. I also love Aukes' writing style, she doesn't overwrite with lengthy descriptions and I loved the addition of Benji. My brother has Downs Syndrome and this character is so beautifully written that it made me feel a special protection for him, like I do with my own brother. I am looking forward to the final book to see how this will all end... but I also don't want it to end!"}, {"userName": "Monica", "userReviewDate": "Mar 10, 2014", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/797352-monica", "userReview": "Survival after the zombie outbreak continues for Cash, Crutch, Jase, and Camp Fox.

But! I question a few things. How does a flock of sparrows run to someone? Do they not fly?Why wasn't the Lady's Captain drawn out a little more in the story? I felt his part in the story and his ship where too quick to exit the story, especially the captains over dramatic end!I also wonder if in the audiobook version of this book of the narrator wasn't bartered for on discount. Over all the flow of the story sucked."}], "description": "The seven deadly sins with a shambling twist.The critically acclaimed DEADLAND SAGA:Book 1: 100 Days in DeadlandBook 2: Deadland\u2019s Harvest Book 3: Deadland RisingIt has been one hundred days since the zombies claimed the world. Cash, along with forty-two survivors, have found safety in the secluded and well-guarded Fox National Park. The leaves are changing colors, a beautiful, brutal reminder that winter is coming. As the survivors prepare for freezing months without electricity and not enough food, they learn of massive zombie herds several hundred miles north\u2026and headed their way. To save the park, Cash must find a place for the survivors to hide from the migrating herds. If Cash and her small band of volunteers don\u2019t succeed by winter, the Fox survivors just may become Deadland\u2019s Harvest.
