To say the prose is prosaic is almost a compliment. There is nothing at all exciting about the prose, in fact it doesn\u2019t even aim for excitement \u2013 its base level is \u2018mundane\u2019 and it hits it with painful persistence right the way through. But most disappointing is how simple it all is. You don\u2019t need to be a genius consulting detective to recognise the bad guys here; I - simple old me - was able to do it with unerring accuracy each and every time. The concepts of \u2018red herrings\u2019 and \u2018misdirection\u2019 are utterly unfamiliar ones to this book.So we have here a Sherlock Holmes novel which is flatly written and in no way exercises the mind, and surely that\u2019s not really the point of a Sherlock Holmes novel, is it?"}, {"userName": "Tony", "userReviewDate": "May 09, 2016", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/1361000-tony", "userReview": "THE STAR OF INDIA. (1997). Carole Bugge. ***.The title of the book reveals a lot ahead of time: we know India is involved; we also know that a famour jewel is involved. The jewel is a gigantic sapphire that was given to the Prince of Wales by an Indian prince as a token of his favor. Before the gift can be made, however, it disappears. Holmes becomes involved in finding it to ward off an international incident. He also learns that his arch-enemy Moriarty is involved in the theft, and two again clash wills and intellects. It all starts off with the odor of a rare perfume perceived by both Homes and Watson while at a concert at Albert Hall. It\u2019s a good tale with a sincere attempt to maintain the customs of the Holmes canon. I did detect, however, the presence of an alternate ending that arose towards the end of the book that was simply discarded by the author. How the editors missed that, I don\u2019t know. Perhaps the author used it as the basis for another adventure. I don\u2019t know. In any event, we meet all the usual characters plus a slew of new ones \u2013 even a highly talkative parrot!"}, {"userName": "Bernard A.", "userReviewDate": "Jan 01, 2015", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/17073653-bernard-a", "userReview": "I am not a Sherlockian or a Holmesian, having read the entire canon only once and a long time ago. That said, this is one great tale. It has all the elements of a Doyle story: deduction; the neurotic detective--who actually becomes introspective for once--the stalwart, if slightly dim, sidekick/biographer; the evil genius; the femme fatal; the Gordian knot of a problem; and the fate of the British Empire in the balance.The plot moves quickly, and Bugge` fills the pages with great details of 19th century London. The dialogue is crisp, and I could not help but hear Basil Rathbone's voice coming out of Holmes's mouth--but that's probably just me.I recommend this not just to those who love Holmes, but to anyone who enjoys mystery."}, {"userName": "Erin Britton", "userReviewDate": "May 09, 2017", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/14515345-erin-britton", "userReview": "October, 1894. Nothing of interest is stalking the streets of London and Sherlock Holmes is plagued by ennui so Doctor Watson, having noticed his friend ominously eyeballing his cocaine stash, suggests an evening jaunt to a concert at the Royal Albert Hall. Unfortunately for Watson, his enjoyment of the Saint-Saens third violin concerto is hampered by the exotically pungent perfume worn by the young lady seated in front of him. While Watson battles his allergies, Sherlock Holmes spots that there is something far more amiss than a surfeit of fragrance and, when the young lady fails to return to her seat after the interval, the game is well and truly afoot.The following morning the mystery of the young lady is uncovered when Miss Violet Merriweather comes to call on the detective duo at 221B Baker Street. She had attended the concert the previous evening in order to pay off a blackmailer and, when the blackguard had failed to show, she left for home during the interval. Miss Merriweather reluctantly explains that she has been conducting a clandestine relationship with a certain young gentleman, a royal young gentleman no less, and that she is now being blackmailed. To complicate matters further, her beau has entrusted to her the Star of India, a priceless gem that was a gift of friendship from an Indian prince. Sherlock Holmes agrees to keep the Star of India safe and to help Miss Merriweather, and he and Watson are soon embroiled in dangerous shenanigans involving chess, parrots, perfume, cockney roughs and a certain recently resurrected arch-nemesis.Carole Bugge\u2019s The Star of India is one of an increasing number of Further Adventures of Sherlock Holmes to be released by Titan [this particular story actually having originally been published in the USA in 1998] and is a testament to the enduring popularity of the world\u2019s greatest consulting detective. The Star of India is more than a simple pastiche though; it is a tribute to the works of Arthur Conan Doyle but it is also a new and interesting mystery in its own right. The story is maybe slightly less complex than those plotted by Conan Doyle himself, or perhaps it is just that Doctor Watson gets to be present for more of the excitement and investigation than usual and so doesn\u2019t have to rely so much on lengthy exposition by Holmes at the close of the case, but the disappearance of the jewel and the various intrigues that accompany it are certainly attention grabbing.With The Star of India Bugge has done a good job of capturing the tone and mood of the original Holmes stories and her dialogue certainly rings true for both the characters and the period. As to the detail of the characters themselves, Holmes is, as ever, seemingly always a step or two ahead of the villains and he is actually quite the man of action in this book. Although his intellect is as sharp as ever, this Holmes is perhaps portrayed as being more emotional than Conan Doyle originally intended in that he deliberately avoids embarrassing Lestrade on a couple of occasions and also seems quite emotionally invested in the plight of London\u2019s street children [Bugge uses the Baker Street Irregulars and feisty urchin Jenny to illustrate the great disparities that existed in society]. Doctor Watson is just as romantic as ever but he is certainly no fool and, of course, provides invaluable assistance to Holmes as well as narrating the story for us.The Star of India is an interesting addition to the Sherlock Holmes canon; a quick though satisfying mystery, it should please fans of Arthur Conan Doyle\u2019s stories eager for more outings [with a relatively authentic feel] for the great detective."}, {"userName": "Nancy Oakes", "userReviewDate": "Feb 12, 2008", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/900340-nancy-oakes", "userReview": "Once again, Sherlock Holmes has sunk into a deep ennui. Evidently there is no crime in England at this time, or at least, none which appeals to his crime-solving genius. Home alone, with Mrs. Hudson visiting her sister in Cornwall, the novel opens with a visit from Dr. John Watson, with an invitation to attend a musical concert. Et voila! A mystery begins as Holmes and Watson take their seats. It seems that a young lady with a very distinct perfume captures their attention (in fact, Watson is almost nauseous with the scent); she fails to turn up during the second act. However, she is soon back within the sights of Holmes & Watson as she comes to retrieve a pair of gloves left at the theater which Holmes has in his possession. Also in her possession: the fabled Star of India, and after hearing the story about how she came to have this famous and beautiful jewel Holmes realizes that his evil nemesis, Professor Moriarty, has returned from Reichenbach Falls where it was believed that he had died. But Holmes knows better. As soon as he makes this determination, it seems that things begin to happen in very quick succession, and as the story progresses, Holmes and Watson become aware of a sinister plot against the English throne. Once more, it's up to Holmes and Watson to save the day.So that's the basic outline of the story. As much as I love the various Sherlock Holmes pastiches (and there are a LOT of them out there), I was unhappy with the \"deus ex machina\" that the author devised to pull him out of a very sticky situation. I won't tell you what it was, but suffice it to say, it was just too pat. Also, I couldn't believe that Sherlock Holmes, with all of his genius, could not figure out one part of the mystery. I mean, I figured it out early on and I'm not Sherlock Holmes! I think the author should have realized that if a reader can figure it out, she needed to make Holmes just a wee bit quicker on the uptake.Overall, it was an incredibly quick read and a fun one. I LOVE Mycroft Holmes (he's always been my favorite character) and I did enjoy the author's portrayal of him. If you want something for pure escape fun, this is it.I would recommend it to people who read Sherlock Holmes pastiches, and who aren't terribly worried about them measuring up to the original product. I have another pastiche by this author which I'll be reading here in the near future."}, {"userName": "Andrea", "userReviewDate": "Oct 28, 2017", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/23693075-andrea", "userReview": "I hate myself a little after reading this book, because over the past year or so I\u2019ve checked it out on 3 or 4 separate occasions, and just now got around to reading it.

A solid mystery, brimming suspense, a gripping showdown with arch-nemesis Moriarty, and of course the oh so glorious bromance (!).

It's a decent effort - a nice inoffensive story that serves to pass the time - but the end result isn't up to the standards set by the original works of Sir Arthur Conan Doyle. This is the first Sherlock Holmes novel I've ever read where I was able to figure out the majority of the mystery long before Holmes did. I'd like to think it's because I am so much wiser as I enter into middle age than I ever was as a bright eyed youth devouring the adventures of Holmes and Dr. Watson... I'd like to think that but reality - in the form of a weak and predictable plot - prevents me from it."}, {"userName": "Read1000books", "userReviewDate": "Jun 14, 2015", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/3796936-read1000books", "userReview": "Attention, Sherlockians: Don't miss this one!
