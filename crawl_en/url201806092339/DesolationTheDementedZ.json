There is something quite profound in being able to sustain this level of intensity and violence for two books. Moving onto book three now. Great fun."}, {"userName": "Rhonda", "userReviewDate": "Apr 15, 2015", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/24217183-rhonda", "userReview": "This is the second book of the series, and like the first book (and I never thought I would say this) there is really too much zombie action. Tom, the main character, has found his wife and child and for a very short while, the safety of a small town.Many things happen very quickly at this point, and he leaves his family to g0 to a near by high school because they believe that children are trapped there. While in the school, they are attacked constantly in every room they go into. In fact, the writer loves to say the zombies are pouring in from every direction. Tom would never have been able to escape the level of zombies that he encountered, plus to make it worse, people tend to die around him leaving him free to live.While Tom is away, the bad guys show up, and put everyone in danger and of course Tom must go through the building and fight zombies pouring from every room to save his family. Sound familiar?With all that being said, Tom is a good man and he never plans for anyone to die around him. I guess he just has nine lives since he's the star of the book. I know I've been very critical of the story, but it's still very decently written, and I would advise zombie lovers to take a shot."}, {"userName": "Elizabeth", "userReviewDate": "May 27, 2015", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/15650947-elizabeth", "userReview": "Well, it was good, but.....I didn't like the way the wife of the great survivalist did nothing but scream and cry most of the time. I thought she would have it more together than that. And I'm mad as hell about Zeus. But I'll probably still get the third book. :-)"}, {"userName": "Karina Halt", "userReviewDate": "Jul 31, 2016", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/45474881-karina-halt", "userReview": "I'm enjoying this series.
