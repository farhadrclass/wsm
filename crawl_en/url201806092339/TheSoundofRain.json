But I shouldn't have worried. I usually love books set in the 1950s, and this one was so fun and also meaningful and tender.Judd Markley leaves behind the Appalachian Mountains after a mine cave-in and tries to make a life for himself on the beaches of South Carolina. There he meets Larkin Heyward, the daughter of his new boss. She's full of life and light, and has big dreams of ministering to the needy in his home mountains.Judd and Larkin take a liking to each other ... but with past wounds, secrets, schemes, and differing plans, will their romance be torn apart?The Sound of Rain was exciting. Fun. Sweet. I loved the 1950s feel, and felt the author did a good job with bringing that era to life. The beach town. Dancing at the Pavilion. Then there were parts of the book that took place in the Appalachian Mountains, another setting I love! There were mines caving in and hurricanes. Walks on the beach and gatherings of mountain folk to dance and visit. Volunteering at the pristine hospitals of Myrtle Beach, and helping the needy in the hills of Kentucky.Judd was sweet. Larkin was bubbly. I laughed and I sighed. Some parts of the romance were just so completely adorable. *heart eyes*A couple things I would mention ... the ending felt a little rushed. So much going on. I didn't really care for Peter's character - I felt he acted in a way that was wrong and didn't own up to it. Some of the characters went back and forth in a way that was a little confusing and made me feel I didn't really get to know them, at times.But overall, it was a very delightful read, with some lovely romance, meaningful lessons, and adventure. I really enjoyed.I received a copy of The Sound of Rain from Bethany House Publishers in exchange for my honest review."}, {"userName": "Abigail", "userReviewDate": "Oct 16, 2017", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/64445217-abigail", "userReview": "In the Dark of the Mine, In the Face of Rising Water,In the Shadows of the Hills, Faith Will See Them ThroughJudd Markley knew he could never set foot underground again. The mine collapse that nearly killed him and claimed his brother's life meant leaving West Virginia forever. Although that hard Appalachian world was all he knew, he put it behind him and headed for the open sky of the thriving town of 1954 Myrtle Beach, South Carolina.Larkin Heyward's life in the beach town is uncomplicated, mostly volunteer work and dancing at the Pavilion. But she dreams of one day doing more and being more--maybe moving to the hills and hollers of Kentucky to help the poor children of Appalachia. But she's never even met someone who's lived there--until she encounters Judd, the newest employee at her father's timber company.Drawn together in the wake of a hurricane that changes Myrtle Beach forever, Judd's and Larkin's dreams pull them in divergent directions. It will take a significant sacrifice to keep them together--or maybe, it will take a miracle.Who is up for going on a trip with me to Myrtle Beach, South Carolina and Logan, Kentucky?? After reading this amazing book, I really feel like a road trip is necessary. So, let's pack our bags and travel south. (Well at least for me) What was this book about, you may wonder well let me tell you.Judd Markley has just lost his brother to a mine cave-in that nearly took his life too. After he was released from the hospital, he traveled south to South Carolina. On the train there he meets a man named Hank, they started talking and Hank offered Judd a job at the local timber mill. After meeting with George Heyward, Judd received the job. Hank took Judd to see the ocean for the first time and that is where he ran into the beautiful Larkin Heyward. Now Larkin has always had a desire to help people. Ever since her brother, Ben, \"left\" home, she has wanted to be helpful to people in need. In her free time, she volunteers as a candy-stripper in the local hospital. Even though she helps people at the hospital she feels like she could do more. She then realizes that she wants to go to the Appalachians and help poor people there. She actually had never meet anyone who lived there except for Judd. The Appalachians actually is where her brother is ministering to people there. After catching her mom reading a letter from him, she realized that she could write a letter to him about her coming out North to help with his ministry. Judd and Larkin start to have a budding relationship but then a hurricane hit Myrtle beach and destruction was everywhere. The hurricane was so bad that wind and rain hit West Virginia, where Judd's brother and his family lives. Judd travels out there to help his brother, he takes Larkin along thinking that her father instructed him too. He learns once he is almost there that she tricked him into this journey all along. Once they arrive at his family's house, they spend the night and the next morning he tells her that he is taking her home. Larkin being the stubborn, independent woman she is, she leaves by herself to go to Logan Kentucky where her brother lives. Judd and Abram, Judd's older brother, leave to go catch up with her. Judd knowing her, knows that she has no idea how to get to Kentucky. After a few plot twists here and there, they finally all end up back in South Carolina. This book has so many plot twists and minor plots that we would be here all day if I tried to tell you about them. So, here's what I advise, I just told you the basis of this book know it is your time to go and get this book from your local bookstore or library. Here is what I love about this book:1. Character development. If a book doesn't have good character development it is not worth my time because without character development you have nothing. This book had great character development so thus this book passed one of my few requirements for a great book. 2. Romance. I love the romance in this book because it was just enough not too much and not any less than it should have been. The romance also was very appropriate and not inappropriate. 3. There were many plot twists and minor plots that made the story keep going. Without plot twists and minor plots, a story just cannot keep going. It would be really boring to just have one plot without plot twists and minor plots along the way. 4. This book was very well written!5. Overall this book was amazing!!

Meanwhile, Larkin lives life full speed ahead, trying to follow what she believes God has called her to do. The story seems to follow a realistic pattern more than a fiction pattern. It very much felt the era of the 1950\u2019s. I did find it to be slow moving and without a real thrust of tension that moved the story forward\u2014even during tragedies (which this book had a fair share of). That could likely be me, though.Romance wasn\u2019t highly prominent until the latter half of the book. I\u2019ve just gotta say: I was impressed. Larkin actually prayed about whether or not \u201che is the one.\u201d Usually it\u2019s all \u201cfollow your heart,\u201d so that little bit surprised and delighted me. There were kisses mentioned, but it didn\u2019t feel sensual at all, just mentioned. And through it all, Judd showed honor to Larkin\u2019s dad, even though he was difficult to deal with. I can admire the romance portrayed in this book.Spiritual content had its ups and downs. Ben was very knowledgeable in the Bible and quoted several verses. The other characters seemed to have a nominal understanding of the Bible and what was right to do. At the same time, Larkin\u2019s blatant dishonoring of her dad and going behind his back somewhat disturbed me. It definitely fits her personality, and was halfway dealt with, but it was more of a \u201cthings changed, so thus what she did wasn\u2019t exactly wrong.\u201d And I still never got where Judd stood with his relationship with God. He didn\u2019t go to church until it was to impress/be with a girl. He had good morals, but it wasn\u2019t because of his relationship with God. Also, the only mention that went anywhere near salvation was when a granny was asking about \u201cDo you think I\u2019ll see them again?\u201d and Larkin assured her that she was certain she would, but there was nothing mentioned about whether or not she had received Jesus Christ as her personal Savior (and the only way to Heaven). So, there seemed to be spiritual content in this book, it was just somewhat vague and shallow with some dips at leaning toward strong.*I received this book from Bethany House and happily provided my honest review*"}, {"userName": "Hannah", "userReviewDate": "Oct 09, 2016", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/17442587-hannah", "userReview": "[Okay, first off. Larkin's great escape. Now, as a young woman of 21, I don't see that she was obliged to stay and let her father force her away from Christian work, but there are lots of other ways she could have accomplished her goals without her deceit and her running away alone with a single man and her careful deception of both of them. Why didn't her father demand they marry as soon as he caught up with them? Also, this part makes her seem more 16 than 21; she doesn't seem to have a real calling to spiritual ministry, though when she sees a physical need she wants to meet it. It felt very childish of her and pretty much a selfish wish to join her beloved brother rather than a calling on her life.Second, Judd's faith. Ben carefully talks through with Judd what he actually has experienced from God and encourages him to give God another chance. Judd shares how he wanted to go forward in church, but was prevented by his father in boyhood. While he begins to go to church, and to pray, he doesn't ever have a salvation moment. When Larkin is talking about being led of God to marry him, I had a really hard time believing that God would lead her to marry anyone that wasn't a committed believer. I never got convinced that Judd was. His life turned around because of Larkin in it, he states more than once. Sorry, but God isn't in the business of salvation by romance. He saves by faith.Third, the final denouement. Judd decides he is glad for her father to have manipulated him into marrying Larkin simply because he thinks he wants the career. He splutters a bit, but sits down and has drinks with her dad and basically tosses Larkin's dreams under the table. Not cool, Judd. Not cool.

I find myself reading out loud from time to time just to hear the impact of her words. The Sound of Rain is an exquisite escape into another time and place. And I have a secret fascination for all things Appalachia. Stoic people, hardworking and proud. They blend faith and culture into a fascinating seize-the-moment kind of living that really speaks to me. But Judd leaves that life in a bid to escape heartbreaking reminders of all that he has lost. He flees the darkness of the coal mines for the promise of light in work above ground in South Carolina. What he doesn't realize is that he carries that darkness within him.By contrast, Larkin's light shines brightly. Enthusiastically. Misdirected at times but she has a gift for brightening the lives of the people around her. It's a dangerous gift in the hands of someone who doesn't recognize its power -- and Larkin doesn't in the beginning of the story. She's spoiled and idealistic which Judd finds both frustrating and fascinating. But he's drawn to that inner glow and Larkin is equally intrigued by a real-life mountain man.In some ways, Judd and Larkin's stories seem independent of each other as their goals lead them in different directions. That doesn't mean they don't share a lot of 'page time', because they do and when that happens there's an undeniable connection that speaks of hope in their future. Of course, there's a lot to work through before Thomas brings us to that end. Larkin needs to grow up some, and Judd need to open up more. There's a lovely spiritual undercoating that binds their stories together even when they are miles apart. Sarah Loudin Thomas delivers another stunning portrayal of life and love and the faith that connects it all."}, {"userName": "Amber Stokes", "userReviewDate": "Jan 12, 2018", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/3571177-amber-stokes", "userReview": "With an echo of some elements from Christy by Catherine Marshall, but a cast of characters with a story all their own, The Sound of Rain enchanted me. Not all at once. I liked the writing style from the beginning, but it's a gentle read, like comforting rain tapping on the roof\u2014even through the suspenseful scenes (including facing a hurricane or the terror of a dark mine). I think part of it is because the story is more concerned about the bigger themes and doesn't let temporary things sidetrack the message.I loved the two main characters (even though Larkin takes a bit of getting used to, with her recklessness and stubbornness). It's their interactions with the people in their life, including each other, that make the story sparkle, even when those conversations or kindnesses might seem ordinary or mundane. This is a story about learning to love wherever you go. It's about seeking after what's important and not getting so distracted that your real life slips by. It's a sweet romance that tackles the tough questions about whose dream to follow and what togetherness can accomplish. Meet Judd and Larkin, their families and friends, and stop for a moment to listen to the rain stirring life in ready soil.*With thanks to Bethany House for providing me with a free copy of this book.*"}, {"userName": "Jamie", "userReviewDate": "Feb 26, 2017", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/8586696-jamie", "userReview": "Sarah Loudin Thomas has written a well researched historical and very romantic story. There\u2019s no doubt about that. If you enjoy romance set in interesting places and times, I think you should check this one out. It\u2019s definitely a love story for the hopeless romantics.But, I can\u2019t say it was my favorite of her novels. You see, this one isn\u2019t like her previous novels and series, where the heroines each had unique qualities and characteristics. I LOVED that about them. It was such a different take on a historical fiction novel (with the thread of romance as well), and it added a creative layer to the story and the different relationships of the characters. I was hoping for something like that again. I know it\u2019s not always fair to judge novels that way, but I\u2019m human internet :).So while this isn\u2019t my favorite from Thomas, if you love all things romance, be sure to give this one a chance.(Thank you to Bethany House for a copy of the book.

Things I loved: I enjoyed the slow burn of the novel, the atmospheric writing that pulled you backward in time. The author did a fabulous job of immersing the reader into the logging era, the dancing of the 50\u2019s, the vehicles and clothes and overall aura. I enjoyed the characterizations from Judd to Larkin to Pete and Ben and all the other personalities. It was also neat to have a novel set in a historical setting at Myrtle Beach.Things I wasn\u2019t sure about: the book implied that the hurricane would really catapult the storyline and tension. I was disappointed it had only a cameo in the story that lasted about two chaps. The storyline was solid and as mentioned before, slow burn. However, I teetered between enjoying the quiet day to day life of the characters, and wishing there was more tension in the novel and a more centralized plot. Instead I felt there were several small plots all resolved at various times in the book and wrapped around the characters instead of the characters wrapped around the story. All in all, a good read if you\u2019re looking for a quiet, pleasant read with light romance, southern charm, and low stress situations. :)I will read more of Sarah Loudin Thomas\u2019.

With a comprehensive cast of characters, the reader will find that they weave their way into your heart.The novel's main themes are about knowing God and having the correct priorities. \"There's making money and then there's making a living.\" There is nothing wrong with having money and possessions but when they are your sole focus, something is wrong. People should come first. Relationships should be a priority as it is too late once people are gone.There are characters who have hearts for people, who put people first and cannot be swayed by bribery.A relationship with God is important. We need to listen to Him and follow His plans. If we do not know what they are, we must ask Him.God always answers prayer. We must pray at all times. Sometimes life is tough and only God can get us through.There is the theme of grief. Grief hurts. Grief consumes. Grief can take over. The only comfort we can have is that if our loved one knew Jesus, they will reside with Him and we will see them again one day.We all have dreams. The novel shows the importance of following our God given dreams.Family is important. Fractured families hurt. We need to work on restoring relationships.We are called to shine our light wherever we go. Light is needed to shine in this dark world. This is powerfully illustrated in the novel as part of it is set in a mine. We need to follow the light. Some people are the light.

He leaves his home in West Virginia to go to Myrtle Beach, South Carolina, where he finds a job working for a timber company. When he first meets Larkin Heyward, his boss's daughter, he figures she's spoiled and shallow, but as he gets to know her better, he realizes there's more to her than a rich girl who likes dancing. Larkin has been volunteering at the local hospital, but she finds herself wanting to do more and decides to join her minister brother Ben in rural Kentucky to help the people there. As she comes to know Judd better, she's torn between her desire to help the people in Appalachia and her feelings for Judd, who doesn't want to leave his job working for Larkin's father. This book was delightful! I loved the setting; I was so drawn into the time period (it's set in 1954) and the locations. I've never been to West Virginia, South Carolina, or Kentucky, but Sarah Loudin Thomas made all of those places real for me with her descriptions. Beyond that, though, the characters just pulled me in. From the get go, I couldn't help but feel for Judd, who's a lost without his brother and has to figure out what the future has in store for him. I also liked seeing Larkin find her own strength. Secondary characters (like Granny Jane!) stole my heart as well. There were so many great themes, such as figuring out what actually matters in life, finding the path God wants for you, and living again after a loss, that most readers will be able to relate to.

Though I was a bit skeptical when it came to the 1950's rich girl/poor boy storyline, it was so much more than this.It was the potentially condescending desire of a rich 21 year old girl to help those less fortunate, where such help is not wanted, that had me prepared to dislike Larkin as a character. Her work as a Candy Striper began to wear me down, however, and just like Judd, I was won over by her joyous nature. I found I quite liked them as a couple well before the end. Not without a bit of frustration, however, as Larkin makes some poor decisions and they each try to figure out what and who they are meant to be.As joyous and charmingly naive as Larkin is, Judd is endearingly humble, and admirable in his care for others and straightforward nature. Both the Appalachians and the South Carolina coast are depicted with details that bring the 1950's setting to life. From the weather to the assortment of secondary characters, the struggles with faith, purpose, honesty, and manipulation come together with the slow building romance of Judd and Larkin for a heart-warming and enjoyable read.

During his travel he met a man who helped get him a job with Waccamaw Timber Company. He advanced in his job quickly.

Her brother moved to the Appalachia to help others and minister to them. She wants to join her brother on his ministry. But her father wants her at home. Since his son will not take over the company, he wants Larkin to marry the man who will. This is such a good book. This is a story of relationships, family and caring for others. The story shows that we should turn to God before going forward with what we want to do. The descriptions are so clear it is easy to imagine the fear of cave ins, the heat, and the winds and rains of the hurricane. The parts in the story that stand out to me are the care Judd gives to his injured co-worker, even when he is caught between his co-worker and his employer. As well as the forgiveness Larkin's father has toward this worker who was out to get his family property back. I would recommend this book to anyone who enjoys Christian historical fiction.

Larkin (whose name I loved) was a little harder to like at the beginning. She seemed rich, spoiled and frivolous. But soon she was shown to have a really good and caring heart. Her father was tough as nails and I didn't see anyway for him to ever change his attitude about his family or his work. I related a lot to the language and dialect. Many of the sayings and way of talking was very familiar to me. It made the story so much more realistic. I love any story written in the 1950s when life seemed so much more simple, even though I'm sure it wasn't.

It's setting is different from my normal read. I loved the historical tidbits of 1950's Myrtle Beach, Hurricane Hazel and the Appalachian hills of Western Virginia and Kentucky. Judd and Larkin, both from such diverse worlds, struggle with discerning and following God's will in their lives. George, Larkin's father, struggles with wanting to leave a legacy. But what kind of legacy is of true value?  The author immediately pulled me into the story from the very first page. She is skillful in painting a picture with words that draws the reader into the story, rich with images and authentic vernacular. I look forward to reading more books by this author.

Sarah Loudin Thomas wrote another winner with this book! The characters are real and memorable. The plot is not predictable (like many novels).

From Mountains of West Virginia to the coast of Myrtle Beach, SC and to the hills of Kentucky this book will introduce to various cultures and people that populate the various regions. I found the descriptions of the locations realistic and believable.Rich with Appalachian dialect, and feisty characters you are sure to feel like you are right there in the story. I did, however, find it difficult to connect with the main characters. While they are charming and believable, I just couldn't quite seem to connect with them in this story.My favorite character is a secondary character, Granny Jane, a cantankerous old woman from the hills of Kentucky. Her wisdom and wit brought a smile to my face on more than one occasion.If you are looking for a story to read that will give you a glimpse into what everyday life was like for people living the in the 1950's then you won't want to miss this story. Overall, I'd give this book 3.5 stars, as this is an enjoyable story to read. \u00a0(I receive complimentary books for review from publishers, publicists, and/or authors, including Netgalley.

I was sad that I didn't get to read this one right when it came out, but life was very busy then.This book was beautiful. I love how she can take hardship and turn it into opportunity. I loved the friendships that came about in this book. I loved the redemption of more than one character. Truly, I just loved everything about it.But honestly what I truly love about her books is the setting. I do not have any personal knowledge of the mountains of West Virginia or about mining camps or timber camps. But reading these books transports me not only to that time but also to those locations in a way that most authors cannot do. I love that in her books I can smell the wood burning cook stove and can feel the humidity of South Carolina. Few authors can transport you that well and I love her books for it.I also really appreciated the love story in this book. In some ways it moved quickly but it felt genuine even it its speed. And the progression of the relationship made sense and was very sweet.This book reminded me a little of Ruth in the Bible in the way that Larkin viewed marriage. I liked how important prayer was to many of the characters and appreciated how the Granny in Kentucky didn't waste any time in telling Larkin to talk to God about her problems.The book Christy by Catherine Marshall has been coming up a lot lately. And I cannot help but think that everyone that loved that book or the TV show would enjoy Thomas' books too.I received a copy of this book from the publisher.

When he's brought out of the mine and recovering in a hospital, he's told that his younger brother Joe was one of the fatalities at the mine. It is at that moment that Judd realizes he may never be able to go back down in the mines again. Jobs are relatively scarce in West Virginia if you're not a miner, so the only option for Judd is to leave his family and home state. Traveling south, Judd goes to Myrtle Beach, South Carolina to begin working for a timber company. Although he doesn't know much about logging, he is a diligent, honest, hard worker as well as eager to learn. His diligence and eagerness, along with his mechanical abilities, pay off and he quickly begins to move up within the company. Larkin Heyward wants more from life than to just be a dutiful wife and good mother to an up-and-coming young, local businessman. She would like nothing better than to follow in her older brother's footsteps and become a missionary in Appalachia. Until she can join her brother, she fills her time as a candy-striper at a local hospital where she brings joy to many she meets and attends to, and begins to enjoy the companionship of Judd Markley. Then a devastating hurricane hits Myrtle Beach and the city will never be quite the same. Judd even takes time off from work to travel back to West Virginia because that same hurricane has caused wreck and ruin at his family's farm. Larkin is traveling with him and plans to continue on to Kentucky to see someone that Judd only knows as the mysterious \"Ben.\" Although Judd plans to head back to South Carolina after helping his family, Larkin plans to stay in Appalachia. How can their relationship go to the next step if they're in different states with seemingly different life goals? Can their relationship go the next step or is this the end? I actually read The Sound of Rain by Sarah Loudin Thomas a few weeks ago and as you can see, the story has stuck with me. There are parts of the story that are incredibly sad, but through it all I found this to be an uplifting and heartwarming story and not just because of the religious aspects (yes, this is a religious fiction book, namely Christian fiction but as a non-Christian reader I thoroughly enjoyed it). Ms. Thomas finds a way to incorporate basic ethical and moral values into a story without bashing the reader over the head with the lesson. This story leaned heavily towards Christian fiction as opposed to inspirational fiction simply because there's more discussion of the Christian faith and numerous scriptural references included in the storyline. At first, I thought Larkin was a bit flighty, but once I got to know her I couldn't help but admire her tenacity and spirit to overcome the societal norms of the time and try to do something different, even in the face of her father's disapproval. Judd is a quiet man that works hard, has few good friends, and always tries to see the good in people rather than being judgmental. Yes, there's romance but the romance is slow to build and is tender and heartwarming. Yes, there is drama and most of it is caused by Larkin and her father. There aren't really any bad guys in this story, although there are one or two guys that do questionable things. The Sound of Rain is a story about faith, family, romance, and endurance. I could go on and on about this sweet and touching story, but I'll simply say that if you enjoy reading well-written inspirational or Christian fiction with interesting characters and storylines, then you'll definitely want to read The Sound of Rain. If you're not sure about the Christian fiction component, but just want a feel-good historical fiction read, then I suggest you grab a copy of The Sound of Rain to read. I have read (and enjoyed) everything written by this author and am looking forward to reading more from her in the future.(I enjoyed reading this story so much, I gave a copy to my mother to read. She loved it so much that she gave it to another family member to read after that. That copy is still making the rounds in the family.)This review originally posted on 12/17/2017 at http://www.thebookdivasreads.com/2017...."}, {"userName": "Mandy", "userReviewDate": "Nov 21, 2017", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/51670924-mandy", "userReview": "This lovely book is near and dear to my heart for many reasons. First, I live in the Appalachian mountains and have vacationed in Myrtle Beach so I easily identified with the characters and the locations set in this story. In addition, I have experienced several hurricanes and their aftermath firsthand during my years growing up. The Sound of Rain beautifully ties tragedy, young love and personal growth together in a sweetly woven story that takes place between the mountains, the ocean and the hearts of two yearning people. I loved the easy flow of this story... It was soft and touching with many author-induced smiles along the way, especially when referencing the humidity of South Carolina versus the cooler air of the mountains. I appreciated how Judd wanted to carry on his deceased younger brother's memory while courageously embarking on a new path and welcoming change. The author created a character whom we can all fall in love with as a man of integrity, grit and perhaps even a quiet passion. As for Larkin, I enjoyed seeing her pursue the repairing of a relationship between her family members. In her pursuit, she becomes the main tie in connecting her family and helping them grow back together. The author beautifully portrayed Larkin as a delightful caring, willing spirit who should be an inspiration to us all.Amidst all the glory of this tender story, a massive hurricane and quite possibly one of the largest of it's decade, makes landfall in the heart of this book. While I do believe the author accurately described the historic details of the storm, I wondered where the fear of such an intense storm was. Oftentimes, witnessing howling winds shake the very walls of your home while weathering a category 4 storm is quite unbelievable. The aftermath of such is a state of disarray; so much so that life doesn't easily resume, especially without power, aid from neighbors and the accessibility to roads, food and stores. I am certain, however, that the author merely included this historic storm as a way to draw her characters together and give them a deeper connection while using the event as a bridge for the rest of the book's plot, rather than as a show stopping experience like this hurricane most likely was for life at that time. As the story continues to unfold after the storm, readers begin to soul search along with the characters and learn that God has a way of honoring our dreams and changing our hearts to see His dream for our lives. That was, perhaps, my favorite part of this book and a beautiful thought to absorb. For readers who enjoy historic fiction and the 1950's era particularly, I know you'll love this book! You'll not only fall in love the characters, but you'll find yourself enjoying a look back in time at coal mining, beach trips to the oceanfront and a well-researched peek into timbering the land and the U.S. Forestry division. I gave this story four stars because I eagerly looked forward to every moment I could spend in this book and it truly was a heartwarming story with a beautiful, underlying message. The book was so well written and it flowed naturally, and easily. In addition, I just have to add that the cover with it's gold foiled raindrops, is simply stunning! * I received a copy of this book from Bethany House Publishers in exchange for an honest review.

Set in 1954, The Sound of Rain is a romance of culture, events and a young couple that under normal circumstances would never have come together. Judd Markley is a hero in a quiet, unassuming way that allows him to captures the interest of our heroine, Larkin Heyward. The back cover of the novel paints the picture that drew me in at the start:\"In the Dark of the mine, In the Face of rising Water, In the shadows of the Hills, faith will see them throughJudd Markley knew he could never set foot underground again. The mine collapse that nearly killed him and claimed his brother's life meant leaving West Virginia forever. Although that hard Appalachian world was all he knew, he put it behind him and headed for the open sky of the thriving town of 1954 Myrtle Beach, South Carolina.Larkin Heyward's life in the beach town is uncomplicated, mostly volunteer work and dancing at the Pavilion. But she dreams of one day doing more and being more--maybe moving to the hills and hollers of Kentucky to help the poor children of Appalachia. But she's never even met someone who's lived there--until she encounters Judd, the newest employee at her father's timber company.Drawn together in the wake of a hurricane that changes Myrtle Beach forever, Judd's and Larkin's dreams pull them in divergent directions. It will take a significant sacrifice to keep them together--or maybe, it will take a miracle.\"My Thoughts:This book brings 1954 alive with a young man and woman looking for their purpose in life. Fate brings them together and they are as unlikely to get together as oil and vinegar. She is the only daughter of a wealthy timber company owner. She has the finest clothes, a snappy convertible and the beauty to capture any worthwhile young man in the whole of the county.He is a young man who arrived in Myrtle Beach on the Greyhound bus. He is recovering from the collapse of the coal mine that took the life of his younger brother Joe, leaving him behind with an injured leg along with a wounded heart. Wise beyond his years, he sets out to live the dreams Joe might have had if he hadn't been taken so young. Along the way, he sees much, says less and has a special insight on beyond his 27 years. I recommend this book without hesitation. Sarah Loudin Thomas created well developed characters set in colorful surroundings. I could almost feel myself in the midst of the hurricane or in the dampness of the mine in Bethel, West Virginia. The wise yet colorful Granny Jane comes alive....but wait I must stop here lest I begin to spoil the story for new readers of this wonderful book. Get your copy from your favorite seller of Christian Fiction! As for me, I am already looking forward to her next book!"}, {"userName": "Emily", "userReviewDate": "Dec 29, 2017", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/8685928-emily", "userReview": "I\u2019ll tell you right now - it was the cover that made me want to read it. Oh my word... the colors, the font, the raindrops... GORGEOUS. And the story, a West Virginia coal miner who\u2019s afraid of the dark and a southern belle who wants to change the world? Well, that\u2019s wasn\u2019t exactly a hard sell either. \u2029\u2029Alrighty. So, while I don\u2019t exactly understand the title (I think it relates to the hurricane) the classic fifties feel of Thomas\u2019 writing set up a gentle cadence that walks you into the story.\u2029The Sound Of Rain is a great afternoon read. The kind of book that will leave you sighing on your couch saying, \u201cthat was a nice story.\u201d\u2029But I think, when you\u2019re making up your mind about whether or not to add it to your library, there are a few things that struck me. And they\u2019re things we always consider when we buy Christian fiction.\u2029It all comes down to content, though. Content, content, content.\u2029I\u2019ll admit, I started reading Christian romance when I was in ninth grade. I LOVED a good boy-meets-girl story. And considering YA Christian fiction was virtually nonexistent outside the Christy novels (and I suppose there are two series with an MC named Christy, but I only read the ones set in Appalachia), I read a lot of Lori Wick. Innocent, sweet stories. The Sound Of Rain has the makings of that.\u2029I would ALMOST say that this is a great one to pass off to your daughters once you finish. The romance is very light and sweet and undetailed. But I say almost because of other content that may vary in perspective from reader to reader (but overall, well handled in my opinion).\u2029Thomas doesn\u2019t write in a highly dramatic, tense fashion. She\u2019s very lighthearted, and keeping in mind the Christy books, there definitely some similarities with Larkin\u2019s desire to go to Appalachia. But considering that setting, she doesn\u2019t leave out the realities of culture and social status. Drinking does come up, though briefly and not glorified (Gambling is also mentioned). And while one of the MCs does accept a drink, there is no drunkenness among the primary characters.\u2029My final comment on content is spiritual arc. This one actually has more of an arc than some of the other Christian fiction I\u2019ve read lately. And I will say... while a prominent spiritual arc can either be done VERY WELL or VERY BADLY, this one was very relatable.\u2029Throughout the novel, Thomas explores themes of God\u2019s calling on our lives, trusting his plans, success, failure, family and priorities. And I think, if you\u2019re wrestling with any feelings of frustration in these areas, this book will touch you. \u2029I received a free copy from Bethany House in exchange for an honest review.
