But this book is so much more than its historical setting. I fell head-over-heels in love with the narrator of this book, Delphine, and her younger sisters, Vonetta and Fern. With a group here on Goodreads, I recently reread the wonderful short story collection Gorilla, My Love by Toni Cade Bambara. We all loved Bambara's strong, resilient African American girls, and Delphine is certainly a full-fledged member of that sisterhood. Smart, brave, and responsible far beyond her age of 11-going-on-12, Delphine has looked after her younger sisters along with her father and Big Ma since her mother abandoned the family seven years earlier. When Pa decides that the girls need to get to know their mother, they travel to Oakland where they encounter a very different mother than the one they pictured. Their experiences in Oakland with their mother, Cecile/Nzila, are perfectly related through through Delphine's eyes. Part of Williams-Garcia's brilliance is that she keeps Delphine's point of view, but through Delphine, we come to know her sisters, the political climate of the time, and the other characters in the book, including Cecile/Nzila. Although no one would argue that Cecile/Nzila is anything but a truly terrible mother, Williams-Garcia, through Delphine, gives us a glimpse of the reasons behind her actions and we are able to feel compassion for her - no small achievement!There is no neat, happy conclusion to this story, and it would not be believable if there were. But there is growth on everybody's part and there is greater understanding. And, above all, there are Delphine, Vonetta, and Fern - beautiful, wonderful girls that I will never forget. Yes, this is a middle-grade novel, but it is so richly layered and beautifully written that I suspect that many readers of all ages will treasure this book. Many thanks to Rita Williams-Garcia for Delphine, Vonetta, and Fern and this dazzlingly beautiful book."}, {"userName": "Betsy", "userReviewDate": "Jan 02, 2010", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/221050-betsy", "userReview": "When I heard that teen author Rita Williams-Garcia had written a middle grade novel for kids I wasn't moved one way or another. I don't read teen books. Couldn't say I knew much of the woman's work. When I heard that her book was about the Black Panthers, however, my interest was piqued. Black Panthers, eh? The one political group so difficult to write about that you can't find them in a single children's book (aside from The Rock and the River by Kekla Magoon, of course). So what was her take? How was she going to do it? But the thing is, One Crazy Summer is more than merely a historical tale. It's a story about family and friendships and self-sacrifice. There are so many ideas floating about this little novel that you'd think it would end up some kind of unholy mess. Instead, it's funny and painful and just a little bit brilliant. One Crazy Summer is a book that's going to earn itself a lot of fans. And a lot of them are going to be kids.Eleven going on twelve Delphine has always kept a sharp eye on her little nine and seven-year-old sisters Vonetta and Fern. That's because their mother left them seven years ago and never came back again. \"Cecile Johnson - mammal birth giver, alive, an abandoner - is our mother. A statement of fact.\" So when their father packs them on a plane and sends them to Oakland, California to see Cecile, their mom, the girls have no idea what to expect. Certainly they didn't think she'd just leave them in a kind of daycare over the summer run by members of the Black Panthers. And they probably didn't expect that their mother would want near to nothing to do with them, save the occasional meal and admonishment to keep out of her kitchen. Only Delphine knew what might happen, and she makes it her mission to not only take care of her siblings, no matter how crazy they make her, but also to negotiate the tricky waters that surround the woman who gave her up so long ago.The whole reason this novel works is because author Rita Williams-Garcia has a fantastic story that also happens to meld seamlessly into the summer of 1968. I've been complaining for years that when it comes to the Black Panthers, there wasn't so much as a page of literature out there for kids on the topic (except the aforementioned The Rock and the River and even that's almost teen fare). Now One Crazy Summer is here. Certainly I don't know how Ms. Williams-Garcia set about writing the darn thing, but if she had stridently set about to teach without taking into consideration the essentials of good storytelling, this book would have sank like a stone. Instead, she infuses this tale with danger, characters you want to take a turn about the block with, and the heat of an Oakland sun.I mean, take the people in this book! Someone once sold this story to me as \"The Penderwicks meets the Black Panthers\" and for the longest time I couldn't figure out why they`d said it. Then I started thinking back to the sisters. Ms. Wiliams-Garcia must have sisters. She must. How else to explain the dynamic between Delphine, Vonetta, and Fern? So it all became clear. If you love the family dynamics of The Penderwicks, you'll probably find yourself loving the same thing here. Of course, when your heroine is an upright citizen like Delphine there is a danger of making her too goody goody to like. But this girl isn't like that. She has a duty that she believes in (taking care of her sisters) and she'll do it, even when they fight each other. Even when they team up against HER! The sheer unfairness of what Delphine has to handle, and the cheery lack of complaining (aside from the occasional and very understandable grumble) makes you care for her. Her interactions with her mother are what make you love her.Because this mother is a pip. Cecile throws a wrench (and a couple of other metal objects besides, I'd wager) into the good guy/bad guy way of looking at things. For kids, she's a pretty clear-cut villain from page one onward. And adults who have enough historical understand to be clear on why she does some of the things she does still won't like her. I wouldn't even be surprised if some parents referred to her as the world's worst mother. She isn't really, but many a parent's ire will be raised when they see how she refuses to call her daughter Fern by her name out of spite, or refuses to so much as look her own daughters for a while. Heck, this may be the only book where the phrase, \"Should have gone to Mexico to get rid of you when I had the chance,\" comes from the lips of a parental unit (not that any kid in the world would decipher what it means). Under normal circumstances, when you get a kid talking about the selfishness of their parent at the beginning of a book they turn out to be wrong in the end. So naturally I was waiting on tenterhooks for much of this book to see if Cecile would be perfectly redeemed by the story's end. Williams-Garcia never wraps anything up with a cute little bow, but she gives you closure with Cecile and maybe a drop of understanding. It's a far better solution.Williams-Garcia will even use character development to place the story within the context of its time. The opinionated Big Ma who raised the three girls gives her thoughts on any matter rain or shine. Delphine then lists them, and kids are treated to a quickie encapsulation of life in '68. Pretty sneaky. Teaches `em when they're not looking. And one of those very topics is the Black Panther party. I was very pleased with how Williams-Garcia sought to define that group. She dispels misconceptions and rumors. Delphine herself often has to come to grips with her initial perceptions and the actual truths. As for the rest of the time period itself, little details spotted throughout the book make 1968 feel real. For example, the girls play a game where they count the number of black characters on television shows and commercials. Or the one time Delphine had felt truly scared, when a police officer in Alabama pulled her father over.And, I'm sorry. You can make amazing, believable characters all day if you want to, but there's more to writing than just that. This writer doesn't just conjure up people. She has a way with a turn of a phrase. Three Black Panthers talking with Cecile are, \"Telling it like it is, like talking was their weapon.\" Later Cecile tells her eldest daughter, \"It wouldn't kill you to be selfish, Delphine.\" This book is a pleasure to cast your eyes over.There is a moment near the end of the book when Fern recites a poem that is just so good that I couldn't seriously believe that a seven-year-old would be able to pull it off. So I mentioned this fact to a teacher and a librarian and found myself swiftly corrected. \"Oh no,\" said the librarian. \"Seven is when kids are at their most shockingly creative. It's only later that they start worrying about whether or not it's any good.\" So I'm willing to believe that Fern's poem could have happened. Otherwise, I certainly would have appreciated an Author's Note at the end with information about the Black Panthers for kids who wanted to learn more. And I was also left wondering where Delphine got her name. She spends a bit of time agonizing over that question, why her mother named her that, and never really finds out. Some kind of explanation there would have been nice.It was teacher Monica Edinger who pointed out that One Crazy Summer pairs strangely well with Cosmic if you look at them in terms of fathers (on the Cosmic side) and mothers (One Crazy Summer's focus). That's one theme for the book, but you could pluck out so many more if you wanted to. Race and family and forgiveness and growth. Everyone grows in this book. Everyone learns. But you'll have so much fun reading it you might not even notice. You might just find yourself happily ensconced in the world of Delphine, Vonetta, and Fern without ever wishing to leave it. If this is how Ms. Williams-Garcia writes books for kids, then she better stop writing all that teen fare and crank a couple more like this one. Kids are gonna dig it.Ages 9-12."}, {"userName": "Rincey", "userReviewDate": "Jul 23, 2016", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/278339-rincey", "userReview": "Well, that gave me a whole lotta feels."}, {"userName": "Ivonne Rovira", "userReviewDate": "May 24, 2014", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/3803671-ivonne-rovira", "userReview": "[The poet formerly known as Cecile Johnson seethes with revolutionary fervor, admittedly essential for social change; I get that.

FabulousCharacters? EngagingNewbery material? Well, I suppose since adults are the ones to vote, then yes. Probably. But if kids were voting, I'm not sure this book would make the Newbery radar. I started reading it to my kids and ended up finishing it myself. Normally when kids have an awful, self-centered mother or parent figure in children's literature, there is a candy house or 7 little men to make up for it. Not so in this book. Cecile never seemed to come around to her own flesh and blood. I kept thinking there'd be a point where she would wake up and develop a shred of human decency, but she didn't. And maybe it has something to do with the fact that I was an oldest child who was given responsibility for my younger siblings I didn't always want, but poor 11 year Delphine being forced to take over the roll of mother to her two little sisters really boiled my blood. Not fair! Her responsible nature was exploited at the expense of her childhood. I realize I'm missing the point the story was trying to make; about the unfair struggles that went on in the black community in Oakland in the 70's. Maybe the idea was for the reader to draw the parallel between the unfairness of Delphine having the world's suckiest mom and the unfairness of the African American person's daily struggle to be treated civilly and with human decency. Both situations were maddening and made no sense.How could Pa and Big Ma send their three little girls across the country to spend an unsupervised summer with a woman they knew full well had not one ounce of motherly love? The story definitely had it's moments of triumph, like when Delphine was finally allowed in the kitchen to cook a regular meal for her sisters, the day trip into San Francisco, or when Fern ratted out Crazy Kelvin with her poem. I was just so overwhelmed with dislike for Cecile and anger at Delphine's lot to enjoy this story as I should have. Could it be that that was the point?At any rate, I don't think Cecile deserved that hug at the end. Surely not."}, {"userName": "Beth Knight", "userReviewDate": "Sep 16, 2011", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/688928-beth-knight", "userReview": "This is one of those \"one more chapter and then I'l...(clean the kitchen, throw some clothes in the washer, take a shower, etc...)\" kind of books. I loved it. I think Rita Williams-Garcia is a fantastic writer and she derserves all the awards and honors she got for this book. This is the first book of hers book I've read but it won't be the last. The story is fascinating (3 girls travel to California during the summer of 1968 to stay with the mother who abandoned them years before) and the setting is atmospheric. I loved reading about the Black Panthers, and even hearing the names of TV shows brought back memories of my childhood (I had just turned 4 during the summer of 1968). All three girls are delightful but the oldest, Delphine, is especially strong, smart, sassy and funny. Her maturity and her relationship with her younger sisters is inspiring. I highly recommend this book to readers of all ages."}, {"userName": "Lisa Vegan", "userReviewDate": "Oct 25, 2010", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/83445-lisa-vegan", "userReview": "Wow, what a trip, as we used to say back in \u201968. Did this ever bring me back to the summer of 1968! I was not an African-American eleven year old girl visiting Oakland, but I was a fourteen year old white Jewish girl across the bay living in San Francisco. There was a chapter that takes place in San Francisco.So, the author got one thing wrong about Oakland (no, there are no hills at all in that part of town) and maybe one thing about San Francisco wrong: I don\u2019t think there were palm trees in that location, but I could have just forgotten, I suppose. Otherwise, much of the locale and time period seemed authentic.This story definitely fits on my orphaned-and-quasi-orphaned kids shelf.I really liked Delphine the narrator, at 11 going on 12 and the oldest of 3 sisters who live in Brooklyn, New York with their father and paternal grandmother, and who go to visit their birth mother in Oakland, a woman who abandoned them when they were very young.I thought most of the story rang true. It was a bit on the edge of seeming realistic at times, yet so was my life at a certain point in time, so I bought it. The ending seemed not quite right but I can think of many other endings that would have worked even less well. I am glad that Delphine got some answers, very glad, and knowing what Delphine learns does give more credence and depth to what happened with this family, and why Cecile did what she did and why she was the person she became. I love the sisters\u2019 relationships with one another, especially how the oldest is most irritated by her middle sister but feels as though she knows her well, compared to how she loves her little sister even though she\u2019s a bit of a mystery to her, and then how the two youngest fight with one another ; it all seemed very genuine. The narrator really got across what it felt like to be a minority. She \u201ccounts\u201d other African-American (then going by black or colored) people in various locations; I\u2019ve been a \u201cminority\u201d only a few times, including two school experiences, but during those I definitely noted who else was \u201clike me\u201d and was highly aware of my minority status.This is a fine book for kids who enjoy historical fiction novels with a bit of adventure and novels with a believable child narrator. The story is sad in many ways, but it isn\u2019t depressing.I read this now because I think the Children's Books group is going to read this book as one of their January selections.

It does several things successfully: Sister relationships, kids who have to take on extra responsibility at a young age, homeless teens, and political action in America in the 1960s. And all within a palatable mid-elementary storyline. I worry, though, that kids far removed from that time and place will somehow get the picture that the black panthers condoned abandoning your children. The panther characters in this book seem angry, dogmatic, and tone-deaf to the needs of the actual people in front of them (other than food). The reasons for their political movement and the history behind them are only briefly touched upon. The ending also implies that everything is now okay. Delphine's mother may have told the story of her hard life; it explains, but does not erase, the hardness she has shown her girls. While reading, I kept making connections to the memoir by Alice Walker's daughter http://www.rebeccawalker.com/work/bla... who wrote about living between two worlds, coasts, and parents. I also have to admit that I can't help reading stories like this through my own experience of airline shuttling with siblings to parents whose attention was elsewhere, riding buses to pools and stores and other parts of the city alone at 8 and 11 -- It sounds free and adventurous and full of potential glamour but, for kids under certain age, it just feels unmoored."}, {"userName": "Raina", "userReviewDate": "Aug 21, 2012", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/1640308-raina", "userReview": "Delphine is growing up under tough circumstances. She is the de facto leader of her little family. Her sisters look up to her. Her mom left the family years ago, but now Delphine and her sisters are going to stay with her for the summer. I kind of loved the depiction of this very nontraditional mother. Delphine's mom is politically active, professional, creative, stylish, and not particularly interested in her children. The neglect is awful, of course, but I think it's healthy to see moms who do not fit the ever-giving stereotype. It's closer to reality. At least for some families. I'm particularly interested in 60s social movements, and know pitifully little about the Black Panthers. This is a very specific view, just a tiny part of everything going on. It's fascinating to hear about the way that they teach and induct the children into the political lifestyle. It made me think about propaganda, brainwashing, healthy teaching, and building a societal paradigm. It's thought-provoking - especially for an adult who can see a larger context to the story.I'd be interested to hear what an actual kid thought of the story, though. Would they enjoy it?

The characters are incredibly well-written and unforgettable, and not without their flaws - Delphine, our leading character is fascinating, as is Cecile/ Nzila, her estranged mother. This story also deals with pretty heavy subjects, primarily involving racism in a turbulent time and place - and it does a good job of handling the topic and not sugar coating difficult situations. I believe that this is the first time I've read a novel featuring the Black Panthers - although I have read nonfiction about the party, and I've seen them appear in documentaries as well as drama tv. It's fascinating seeing how they come across from Delphine and her family's perspective. Overall, One Crazy Summer is a must read if you're interested in realistic historical middle grade fiction.

The girls looked so strong and I had to know where they were going.I found myself pulled immediately into the narrative. Delphine, the eldest of three sisters, has such a mature voice for an 11-year old, and her sense of responsibility and integrity shine through her words. I liked how she managed her two younger sisters' moods and behaviours, and functioned as their mother, essentially, while the girls were in Oakland. Regarding the girls' actual mother, wow! She's not the picture of a good mother, but when she explained to Delphine some of her background, I certainly could see why she was so reluctant at first to take on the girls for a month, and really enjoyed the way the author subtly showed her very gradual thawing and reaching out to the girls.I really felt like the author took me to Oakland in 1968, and want to now track down the other books about the Gaither sisters."}, {"userName": "Bookishrealm", "userReviewDate": "Feb 21, 2017", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/27544898-bookishrealm", "userReview": "Update! Here's my full review: http://www.bookishrealmreviews.com/20...This book was phenomenal. I really enjoyed it. It definitely weaves in some interesting aspects of history! I had no idea how involved children were in the Black Panther Party. I knew about it's origins and it's most prominent members; however, I had no idea that children played such a significant role in doing small things for the party such as coloring in protest signs, organizing party newspapers, and protesting and performing at protests. What I really loved about this book was the incorporation of family ties and what it was like for these three young girls who grew up without a mother. It was heartbreaking at first, but I really do think that it all comes together in the end. It illustrates how Delphine takes on a hoard of responsibility since her mom isn't there to take care of her or her sisters. The relationship between the sisters is even interesting. They look to each other for love, courage, and inspiration. It really is a wonderful thing to watch. The only thing that I wished was that there was more Black Panther incorporation into the story. There was quite a bit information; however, it did leave me wanting more.

I personally loved this book. Delphine is easy to empathize with, through her confusions and her pride. Nzilla is a beautiful artist that refuses to play by the rules called out for her, and instead transforms herself to become who she wills herself to be. The writing is rich and playful with words. My only criticism is with the ending. SPOILER ALERT In the very end, Delphine finally gets a chance to talk to her mother and ask why she left. Cecile/Nzilla basically says Delphine wouldn't understand because she's too young. As an adult I can conjecture generalities of her life, but I felt the ending didn't give anything close to a satisfying answer or a piece to ponder for the child reader. Who knows, maybe a kid could understand the complexities of why a mother would leave her own children in pursuit for a new life based on her art. Nzilla is a gem of a character and I'm afraid her answer doesn't break open enough of the mystery that shrouds her past. And I also think Delphine and the reader deserve a more clear piece of her puzzle to ponder upon. A note on teaching this book: I was worried my second and third grader in the ell510 class wouldn't understand the historical references and would fail to see the significance of their search for identity from their mother and their skin color. In the beginning, my students said Cecile is just crazy and a bad mom. They didn't even believe she was their mom! In the second and third class, to my surprise, our discussions were able to lead to Islam, free (freedom) vs. free (cost), segregation in the 1960's, and protests. We even had a great discussion on the way Fern treats her white doll Miss Patty Cake (badly or with love?). I found myself talking more about outside things with this book, which they were actually willing to hear, and it's been working out. I definitely have to resist overtalking and lecturing.

When we started reading it, my 6th grade students raised some questions about the words \"colored,\" \"black,\" and \"Negro\" that appear in the book. I answered the questions as best I could, but then I thought, hey, what does the author think these words mean?I searched for Williams-Garcia's contact info, and eventually came up with an aol address that was prefaced by a warning not to trouble her with your book reports. I wrote her an email about the situation, but my hopes were not high, given my previous failure to contact my childhood hero Daniel Pinkwater through his website and having Kate DiCamillo ignore my question about the Despair Squid from the British SF show Red Dwarf.Williams-Garcia is passionate about the issues in her books, and she wrote a thorough, heartfelt response to my class' question. I can't overstate how empowering it is for 6th graders that an author treated their question seriously and sincerely. They received the message that they should read critically, understand history, and advocate for themselves. They also learned that they were ready to start talking about grown up issues.As far as the book itself, I have some discomfort with it. Specifically, I think the Black Panthers are portrayed too positively, and the police are portrayed too negatively.

The book takes place in 1968 and three sisters are sent from Brooklyn, NY to Oakland, CA to stay with their mother, who left when they were babies. Their mother doesn't want them there, so I can't imagine why their father thought this was a good idea. She's a bad mother. That's it. No redeeming qualities at all (unless you count that she's a poet who cares more about her poetry than anyone around her... and tell me, how can you be a good poet when you care so little about anything but yourself?). There's no \"in the end, she turned out to just be misunderstood.\" Nope. She's just a selfish, bad mother. Which is OK, I understand not all people are awesome. But the book kind of leads you to believe that she's going to turn out to be an OK person. Only she's not. Then there's the Black Panthers. The girls go to a summer camp run by the Panthers because their mother couldn't care less what they do. Turns out the Panthers are OK people, and despite hearing bad things about them from their father and grandmother, they end up liking them. There's no real background in the book about who the Panthers are, so all you really get is \"Pa doesn't like them\" or \"Huey is in jail.\" I feel like I know very little more about the Black Panthers now than when I started reading, other than that they attended rallies and weren't as militant as Pa thought they were. Because I didn't live through the time and have no clue how militant they actually were, I can't even make an guess as to who is right, Pa or the girls or both.I'm really surprised this has been suggested as a Newbery contender.

Delphine is in charge of herding the girls across country from Brooklyn to Oakland and making sure the younger sisters behave and don\u2019t act like a \u201cbig Negro spectacle\u201d. Upon arrival Cecile immediately lets the girls know that she doesn\u2019t want them there and that they better not bother her peace and quiet. Instead of spending time with them, she sends them out to get their own food from the Chinese restaurant and to spend their days at the local community center run by the Blank Panthers. The girls get educated in black power and revolution while their mother stays at home writing poetry for the Blank Panthers. Delphine narrates this story with a strong, no nonsense voice that shows the grittiness of racial adversities during this time period, as well as the issue of the difficult search for a mother\u2019s love. Great for grades 4-7 as a culturally specific book that can help readers more closely examine a highly sensitive and volatile time period in African American history. The characters are well developed and the events in the story will lend themselves to rousing discussion among students."}, {"userName": "Hallie", "userReviewDate": "Mar 16, 2015", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/1145657-hallie", "userReview": "This was so great - it's going on to the (virtual) shelf of MG books that present difficult, even painful family dynamics with a light and humorous touch. Delphine is wonderful, and the time and place beautifully depicted. It was also great to learn about the type of summer camp the Black Panthers ran in many communities. I especially loved the way we see Delphine finally able to voice her anger at her mother for leaving, and know that's not the end of it. Just one small quote: I wouldn't be exaggerating if I said I was born knowing what to do when I sat with Cecile: Don't cry. Stay quiet. Want nothing. I could talk, but I'd learned that, as long as I was quiet, I was allowed to stay with her while she tapped against the wall with her pencil, wrote and wrote and said her rhymes over and over. Don't cry. Stay quiet. Want nothing. Amazingly I ended up understanding Cecile a lot better than I expected to for most of the book, and that's another thing that's really well done. I'm very much looking forward to seeing the correspondence between Delphine and her mother in the next book."}, {"userName": "Katie Lalor", "userReviewDate": "Jan 26, 2017", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/31768985-katie-lalor", "userReview": "I really enjoyed this historical fiction novel because of the history I learned. It centered mostly on the Black Panthers in the late 1960s, which I knew little about. The author incorporated many tools to really show/teach the time period. As for the fiction side, I liked that it came from the perspective of children who knew little about the Black Panthers, and also went on an adventure to discover more about their mother. Another thing I enjoyed about the book was the many historical people that Rita incorporated in her story, including Gwendolyn Brooks.One question that I have is about the saying, \"I have no straw to spin\" (p.172)"}, {"userName": "Mary Ronan Drew", "userReviewDate": "Nov 25, 2010", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/2986995-mary-ronan-drew", "userReview": "This book is a dramatic revisionist history of the Black Panther Party.

The world of 1960's activism and the Black Power movement is seen through the eyes of eleven-year-old Delphine, who, along with her two younger sisters, are visiting their mother for the first time in the summer of 1968. Cecile abandoned the family when the girls were just toddlers, and their father thinks it's high time they got to know each other, so he sends the sibs on a plane from New York City to Oakland, California. Delphine has a hard time reading the sullen, angry woman who writes poetry, is marginally involved with The Black Panthers, and openly admits that \"I didn't send for you. Didn't want you in the first place.\" For four long weeks, the girls struggle to understand the messages of activism they are being taught at the local Black Panther summer camp, while trying to decipher the puzzle that is their mother. By summer's end, after taking part in a peaceful protest, they still don't have all the answers, but they have caught a glimpse into their mother's life and begun to understand the subtle difference between public, personal and family politics. I have been a RWG fan since her first novel, Blue Tights, but she has outdone herself here. The unusual topic, the rich, warm lyricism of the writing, and the perfectly executed portrayal of a child's eye view of a controversial political movement just scream \"Newbery!\" to me. If this title doesn't garner a load of awards come next January, I'll eat my hat.

This book was a TOTAL SOCK-OBLITERATING EXPERIENCE.11-year-old Delphine and her two younger sisters are sent to Oakland from Brooklyn for a month during the summer of 1968 to meet their mother, Cecile, who walked out when the youngest was a newborn. Turns out Cecile, who now goes by Nzila, wants nothing to do with her daughters (who live with their dad and grandmother) -- she's now a poet and an associate of the Black Panthers who seems to be seething at the girls' very presence in her house; every day she sends them off to the local community center's summer program run by the Panthers.Am I making this sound like a Worthy Book, an Important Social History Lesson? It's COMPULSIVELY readable, with such well-drawn characters, lots of dialogue, humor, suspense, even a boy crush. Yes, it offers an absolutely immersive experience of a particular time and place...but he plot unfolds in ways I guarantee you do NOT expect. And I can't recall another character like Cecile in children's lit -- at first she seems like this 60s radical natural-haired terrifying version of an evil queen from a fairy tale...and then, slowly and not cheesily, there's a little nuance. Whenever you say a book is \"brave\" it sounds too noble for words, but I think the portrayal of Cecile is absolutely brave. BUT HEY! THIS BOOK IS AWESOMELY READABLE! REMEMBER THE READABLE! Oh, and Delphine is SO endearing. If the world can be divided into the kind of girl readers who identify with Beezus and the kind who identify with Ramona, well, Delphine is for Beezuses like me.

However, as I'd avoided any reviews that seemed spoilery I had no clear idea of what the story was about, except for the story of three sisters growing up in the 1960's and having some sort of summer adventure.In short, I had no idea what a fascinating, surprising, soul-searching story was ahead of me, and I'm even more happy now that I went in unspoiled, because discovering all the historical, social and emotional layers of this book for myself was amazing. It deals with a time in history, and certainly a perspective on that time, which I'd never read about before; it has a brilliantly authentic eleven-year-old girl narrator and a cast of diverse, flawed, loveable, prickly, complex, passionate, richly human characters; it's full of wit and courage and fear and sorrow; and I would recommend it to anyone -- no, make that shove forcibly at anyone -- who wonders if books for children can really be as well-written and powerful as literature aimed at adults.If I had one very small criticism to make, it's that the climax and resolution of the book feels slightly pat, even a bit Hollywood, compared to the realism of the rest of the novel. But at the same time, it's also emotionally satisfying and I'm not sure how the story would have felt resolved otherwise, so I find it hard to fault the book much for it.Anyway, I hear there are two more books in this series, and now I can't wait to read them.

Often in children's books, the parents are by far the least interesting characters, which is just not right considering the huge importance parents have in a child's life. And even though children may often take their parents for granted, that doesn't mean the reader must.In One Crazy Summer, 11-year-old Delphine sure doesn't take her mom for granted. Cecile left Delphine, her 9-year-old sister Vonetta, and her 7-year-old sister Fern when Fern was just a baby - and now their father has decided it's time for the three girls to fly out from New York to Oakland for the summer of 1968 to get to know their long-lost mother Cecile.Cecile - or Nzilla as she calls herself now - is formidable. Tall and given to wearing pants, hats, scarves, and sunglasses, she exudes an exciting menace and intensity - which is absolutely not for show, as she is so focused on her poetry that she has little attention left over to share with her 3 daughters or anyone else. There is no softness or give to her and she doesn't care what anyone thinks. She won't even waste a kind word on her own kids, much less give them breakfast or lunch, but at least she is always true to her own nature. If it wasn't for her extreme selfishness, especially where her daughters are concerned, I'd find her quite admirable.Delphine, a pragmatic and \"plain\" child (as in plain-spoken, plain-thinking), thinks her mom is crazy, pure and simple, and isn't thrilled to have to be spending all day every day at a day camp run by the Black Panthers, where she has to watch Vonetta make lots of friends instantly and defend Fern from people who make fun of her for loving her little white baby doll Miss Patty Cake. It's surely difficult being the sensible big sister when you're thrust into a bizarre situation.Throughout the next few weeks, Delphine figures out how to make the visit work, making delicate arrangements with her mom (such as being allowed in the kitchen - where Nzilla's printing press is - to make dinner), making a few friends, observing the goings-on of the Black Panthers with a wary eye, and even managing to take her sisters on a great trip to San Francisco. When her mother is arrested and later released, she and her mother have a showdown that is both painful and cathartic, and for me the most powerful part of the whole book.Throughout this novel are many moments that illustrate the often uncomfortable and awkward rubbing together of the old Black culture (Delphine's grandma Big Ma, for example, who refers to herself as Negro or Colored) and the new (the Black Panthers, modern career women who don't automatically identify with Big Ma just because they share the same race). Delphine observes and judges it all, but refrains from forming her own hard and fast opinion - or perhaps it's just that she would rather try to get through each day. Delphine takes so much on her shoulders - finally her own mother (rather ironically) advises her to just let go, have fun, and be eleven years old.The part of this book that touched me most is the way Delphine keeps thinking and worrying about Fern and her white baby doll Miss Patty Cake. Fern has loved that doll since she was an infant - but when Vonetta ruins Miss Patty Cake in a fit of rage, Fern seems to forget all about the doll. What does it mean? How can Fern forget all about something she has loved so long and so deeply? Is she mourning her on the inside? What is going on? It makes us wonder, too, which brings us back to the mystery of Cecile and how she could leave her family. There aren't any real answers, but lots to ponder.The climax at the protest, with the girls' reciting of Nzilla's poem and Fern's own bombshell of a poem, felt inauthentic to me - it was too much a Book Moment, especially Fern's part. Could a 7-year-old really understand what the scene she witnessed meant, and articulate it so forcefully? Nah. It was effective - but at the price of the realism that pervades the rest of the book.As the third generation to be born in Oakland, after my dad and my dad's mom (broke the chain with my own kids, darn it), I'm thrilled to see a slice of Oakland history, and of Black history, brought to such vivid life. Now a part of me will always see Oakland through Delphine's eyes.Highly recommended for grades 4 - 7."}, {"userName": "Michael", "userReviewDate": "Jun 27, 2013", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/303327-michael", "userReview": "[When your mother leaves you at three and doesn't want to speak with you or spend time with you even after eight years, there is a point where all the incredible feelings this evokes must be expressed.
