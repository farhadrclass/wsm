All of the stories were very good, but I especially recommend Elizabeth Strout's \"Snow Blind\", which was so well written and insightful, I looked her up and bought one of her books. A solid collection."}, {"userName": "Sarah", "userReviewDate": "Feb 17, 2017", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/7490808-sarah", "userReview": "Excellent collection.
