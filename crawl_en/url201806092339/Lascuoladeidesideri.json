Roy Straitley is an aging Classics teacher about to reach his 100th term at the school. The sameness and relative serenity of St Oswalds is about to be shattered. A new teacher is up to no good, determined to wreak havoc, perhaps even destroy the school and all those in it. Ultimately, this will become a battle between the honorable Straitley and the wretch bent on revenge and destruction. This is a very engaging read, told alternately from the perspectives of Straitley and his nemesis. It takes place in two times as well, the present, in which small things disappear, evidence appears to incriminate people who are accused of crimes they did not commit. Pawns are used and sacrificed in the deadly game. We are also shown the roots of this evil, fifteen years prior, in which the young person comes to despise the school and its inhabitants. A game of chess, both then and now. Fun, fast reading, thrilling and with an excellent final-chapter twist. Heartily recommended."}, {"userName": "B the BookAddict", "userReviewDate": "Apr 27, 2013", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/19832827-b-the-bookaddict", "userReview": "Joanne Harris is best known for her award winning novel Chocolat that lead to the highly successful film of the same name and two more novels featuring the main characters. Her other novels include Blackberry Wine, Five Quarters of the Orange, The Lollipop Shoes and Peaches for Father Francis. Born in her grandparent\u2019s sweet shop, her family has a tradition of storytelling, folklore, cookery and strong women. It is no surprise then that many of her books feature food, sweets and strong women following their own path. But in Gentlemen and Players, Harris changes tack completely. She has taught modern languages at a boys independent grammar school for fifteen years and from this experience, she has gleaned inspiration.Art does often imitate life so it should come as no surprise then that Harris has set her 2005 novel Gentlemen and Players in the rarefied air of a private grammar school for boys, St Oswalds. The novel is a psychological thriller, which sharply features deceits, flawed childhood, hidden identity, class distinction and revenge; the story ends with a deliciously unexpected twist at the end. There are two narrators; Roy Straitley, the Classics Master, on the eve of his century (100th) term who is affectionately referred to, by his students, as Quasi or Quasimodo as he is a trifle hunched and whose rooms are in the Bell Tower. Straitley is a Luddite; ignoring all requests to attend to his email, he swears in Latin and smokes (banned by the school) secret Gauloises in his office. The other narrator is the unnamed perpetrator who is bent on revenge for a myriad of both real and imagined slights against St Oswalds; a sociopath who is filled with hatred and bitterness. This perpetrator knows no rules he will not break; somehow he has infiltrated the teachers ranks, become on of them; a serpent set loose in the garden. One by one, insurrection among the boys, then scandals involving the staff begin to erupt, bringing chaos to the Michaelmas term.A white King marks the first narrator, Straitley, at the beginning of alternate chapters. The second narrator is marked by a Black Pawn, and is the voice of the unknown enemy within St Oswald's.\u201cIf there\u2019s one thing I\u2019ve learned in the past fifteen years, it\u2019s this: murder is really no big deal.\u201dSuch a tantalising first sentence in a novel! Harris did not disappoint in the rest of the story. It is gripping, clever and well paced; the plot is tightly controlled with impressive ingenuity. A tale for every reader: Most Highly Recommended. 4.5\u2605"}, {"userName": "Phrynne", "userReviewDate": "Oct 08, 2013", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/8655084-phrynne", "userReview": "This book is an absolute delight from start to finish. Joanne Harris has always been a favourite of mine and she certainly did not let me down with this one! Mr Straitly is such a well drawn character I found myself cheering for him the whole time and I was desperate for him to succeed in the end. The last paragraphs of the book brought tears to my eyes. There is a very big mystery angle to this story and although I was able to guess the identity of the murderer fairly early on it was only because having read this author before I was aware of her devious mind and looked outside the square! It was very cleverly written and very entertaining. So so good - easily five stars."}, {"userName": "Tooter", "userReviewDate": "Feb 14, 2017", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/9469263-tooter", "userReview": "Another wonderful read by Joanne Harris. I wish I had read this one before the sequel (A Different Class published 11 years later) but nothing was spoiled by reading in reverse order. I'm looking forward to a third (or fourth...) in the series but, hopefully, sooner than 11 years! Highly recommended."}, {"userName": "Vonia", "userReviewDate": "Feb 18, 2016", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/5204784-vonia", "userReview": "This is definitely the best book I have read so far this year. Why? Let me count the ways. Where to begin? (The only real complaint I have is that the synopsis and teasers given tell a story nothing like what readers have. At least, it reveals only a sliver, and not even a very significant one- comparatively minor enough that it changes the overall perception.) 1. As always, Joanne Harris is an expert at characterization. This is my 4th book by her I read and even if I did not like the book too much overall, her characters have consistently been relatable to the point that I was able to see them in front of me, the two-dimensional dimensional characters becoming three-dimensional. In this book, it is John Snyde, a psychopathic man, and Roy Straightly, a dedicated and loyal Classics teacher for thirty plus years. Entering the minds of these vastly different men is nothing short of fascinating. 2. The book is set up in a chess game format. Book parts, rather than numerical, are labeled: Pawn, King, Knight, En Passant, Check, Bishop, Queen, and Mate. Readers should be told that the two points of view are differentiated by the color of the cheers piece. As for myself, without this information, I failed to notice this and was slightly confused throughout until the very last chapter, although it became pretty clear after several sentences. 3. A psychological thriller. The thrill of the chase. A mystery. A suspenseful battle. A masterfully written all night page turner.4. Themes I appreciate: the shame of the LGBT community, the difficulties inherent in teaching, friendships, parenting, abnormal psychology, loyalty, and institutions and traditions ineradicable and with a character of its own. 5. Sentimental and touching at the same time as appalling and frustrating. The ending is similar to that in Robin William's \"Dead Poet's Society\" (May he Rest In Peace) and quite heart warming. Well, unlike many mysteries and psychological thriller I have read, the eventual reveal was actually unexpected and not, like most, anticlimactic. **** Spoilers **** John Snyde is a man (and woman, as the reader find out as the story continues. He dresses up, first as a teenager posing as his \"mother\" Julia Snyde, then more than a decade later as a professor by the name of Diane Dare) that is driven to madness, by both his feelings of inferiority, his need for revenge, and the death of the only guy he ever really loved. As a child, because of his place on the lower end of the socioeconomic tier of life, he is excluded from the exclusive, sometimes pretentious St. Oswald's Grammar School for Boys. Because of his obsession with what he feels ruined his life, his new obsession is seeking revenge. His definition of this revenge is master planned, with a series of events and planned schemes, from spreading rumors that cause the staff to hate each other, claims of sexual abuse that tears then apart, encouragement to specifically targeted boys to rebel, missing items resulting in planted evidence, etcetera. His most intelligent rival can be found in Roy Straightly, whom is the one to eventually figure out his true identity and in clued in enough to unveil the truth, his true motive: he was the one (with an intense jealously of his girlfriend), many years ago, to push his (unrequited) love from the roof to his death. A satisfying conclusion, although far from perfect. And this is something I also really appreciate. Almost always, on happy endings are exactly that and very frustrating. On the other hand, happy endings are also frustrating in that this is nothing like real life. Here, the bad guy is not caught, having recalled to another country. But in his own way, his pain has caused him to pay for many years. Although many characters are murdered, St. Oswald's endures, as do most of the more likeable characters. Joanne Harris, I liked you before, but now I love you."}, {"userName": "Jeanette", "userReviewDate": "Feb 04, 2017", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/11869072-jeanette", "userReview": "Oh is this a splendid read! I almost gave it 5 stars until just 50 or 70 so pages from the end, when I think Harris jumped the shark a bit. But then I read \"Different Class\" first, so having given that one the 5 star, I felt this first one just shied behind it. It is 4.5 star if I could give it that rating. If you have ever taught for a private institution anywhere, this book will cut to your gut with its sharp spears of recognition. Not just in England is there an embodiment like St. O's. Be it for hundreds of years or 120 or a mere 75, tradition matters. As do the \"eyes\" of the gargoyle in the bell tower room #59. It's a maze of characters and most of them have at least one nickname. The cabals and the choirs of allied voices ever altering and taking juxtaposition. You need to be on your toes. This is no easy or sloppy read possibility. In fact, you may need to backtrack if you happen to catch a hint of what you wanted to \"grasp\" before that section.The voices are duo narrators. And of course one is always our centurion semester champion. So you also have to focus on who is speaking for that chapter or location. And it helped too, for me, that this was a reread for at least 1/2 of the book. I had this once before, way back in the days when it was a newbie and needed to get it back. Laughingly I thought I could speed through it. NO, this is NOT the book for that possibility. Every nuance counts. And the minutia also makes the mood, the wit, the whole piece living and breathing entire realm of susceptibility cemented within the place and times of St. Oswald's Grammar School for Boys.There are too many passages that are worth quoting to post here. About liars, charm, duplicity, and stolid honesty? And yet their opposites too. Do we ever stay 14 in our cutting likes and dislikes? And the psycho-babble asides and pop references add no little salt and pepper to the campus stew.Or to the town or to the Sunnybakers.Joanne Harris writes well. Now and again there glows a hint of bias- but well forgiven. Because even that is exposed shortly for being there. Like R. Straitley, take his example, miss no glimpse or detail! Highly recommend this book. And after you are finished go on to \"Different Class\". Don't do it in reverse, as I did. A few characters are in both and I knew who was NOT going to be gone which took away from the planned confusion. Sourgrapes and the League of Nations non-withstanding. Why is it that most educational situations of esteem worth continue to change their room numbers or hall names or building designations? At anywhere from 5 to 10 years, it's always another go around for continued and proper confusions. It isn't only from donor favor, of that I am sure. IMHO, it's new heads using their own \"Audere, agere, auferre\" powers. Because they can.\"To dare, to strive, to conquer.\" I wonder if the gifter of the fob watch will be returning for a class year #3. If possible or if occurring, I can not wait."}, {"userName": "WarpDrive", "userReviewDate": "Oct 21, 2016", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/16160897-warpdrive", "userReview": "Delightful, engaging and well written thriller, with an interesting plot and credible characters. It beautifully recreates the special atmosphere of an old, privileged, traditional educational institution, and the particular set of idiosyncrasies, values, ineradicable and peculiar attitudes that characterize teachers (as well as students) in such a unique environment. The main character, old-school teacher Straitley, is just lovely and his passion for teaching and culture are contagious. You can not but love the man and wish that you had a teacher like that in your own youth.The finale is also quite good and an apt conclusion to a riveting and well written novel presenting interesting twists and turns. The complex, deep, almost all-consuming relationship between the school and the main characters is beautifully portrayed. St Oswald's School and its peculiar atmosphere with its sounds, smells, and timeless weight of tradition will stay with the reader well after the book is finished. Highly recommended and a well-deserved 4 star rating."}, {"userName": "Sonia Gomes", "userReviewDate": "Dec 12, 2011", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/1948955-sonia-gomes", "userReview": "How do you feel when you know you are nothing but the porter\u2019s son and will never ever be accepted by any of the boys at St. Oswald\u2019s? Oh the agony of being overlooked, ignored, despised when you know that you are as good maybe even better than those snoots. That\u2019s when you transform yourself from Julian Snyde into Julian Pinchbeck, as Julian Pinchbeck you have the run of St. Oswald's, as the porter\u2019s son you have the bunch of keys that allows you to inspect every nook and cranny of St. Oswald, you know its secrets, its joys and aspirations. As Julian Pinchbeck you can eavesdrop into classes, although never an integral part of St. Oswald, you absorb knowledge like a sponge, you even have a mentor who you respect but also dislike. Although you feel a part of St. Oswald you know that you will never belong and that turns into a violent hatred for St. Oswald. And then along comes Leon the rebel\u2026\u2026.You love him with a passion, you will do anything, just about anything to be his friend even when he treats you, your father the porter, and all other people in your social class as something revolting.

You start a new life far away in France but you are never as vulnerable as you were as the porter\u2019s child. You are now educated and know how to look after yourself pretty well, but all along you nurture that awful hatred for St. Oswald\u2019s, you plot and plan your revenge for a decade and then you return to St. Oswald to wreak your terrible revenge from the very inside of St. Oswald, from its very soul you plan to finish St. Oswald. But what new avatar are you planning on?........... If you look at Julian Snyde/ Julian Pinchbeck's life, it could be ours too. How many times have we suffered slights, people ignoring you, people treating you like a bucket of garbage just because you do not belong to a particular social class, because we are not rich enough, the list is endless....And the harder you try the more you fail.Isn't it better then to be your own poor self?

But, (and this might be a bad thing), I'm willing to put up with a little more of that in a really great book. This book is definitely more PG13 than PG.That being said, it's a great story. It's set in a boys' prep school in England and the story centers around Roy Straitley, a latin professor who has taught there for 33 years. Chapters are alternately told in his voice, and the voice of an unnamed new professor who plans to \"take down\" the school. We know from the outset that this new professor is planning murder and mayhem, but we don't know who he is or what he's planning to do. I love Straitley's wry sense of humor and his take on academic life. And the intended murder/mystery aspect is quite gripping.

It's the sort of book that makes you want to turn to the beginning again to see where you might have picked up clues or see what you missed.I am a HUGE Joanne Harris fan, my favourites of hers being the \"foodie\" books and I must admit to being a tad sceptical when I picked this up thinking that maybe she wouldn't do thriller novels quite as well. I was wrong - this lady is no one-trick-pony. From the first page you know that there are a murder or two which sets the reader up for the unfolding story ahead. The story is set in a public boys school that is centuries old and has a mighty reputation to uphold and is narrated by two people in turn to keep us guessing. The old school teacher, Mr Straitley, adds some real comic moments too which add warmth to the book. However, whatever you think you know about this book, think again. By three quarters of the way through I guarantee that you will flick back wondering when you could possibly have missed the signs (not once but twice).

The novel alternates chapters from the perpetrator and the old teacher perspective. Harris does a wonderful job in creating a credible psychopath with a grudge. Although I sensed the identity of the perpetrator, it was a very nice twist. The ending felt a little drawn-out, but a very enjoyable read.

I went to Kepler's a week ago and almost came home with four new books. But I instituted an emergency policy on the spot -- only one book purchase allowed -- and I picked this one. It sounded so promising... I love page turners and this was touted as \"wickedly funny\", literary, and all that good stuff. But my high hopes were dashed! And I gave up after about 120 pages.In short, two narrators -- one who is supposed to be acerbically witty and the other who is ominously sinister. But I found neither to be particularly well done. I'm ruined by Arthur Phillips' \"The Egyptologist\" and Nabokov's \"Pale Fire\". The unreliable narrators in those novels are finely wrought, hilarious, and clever to boot. This book just felt common.Moving on...--After a comment on my review by a \"stranger\" on Goodreads, I thought I'd give this book another try. --October 6th, 2010 (Two weeks after David was born)Okay, I'm circling back to review this book more fully, after picking it up again after three years and actually finishing it. First of all, my review from three years ago was totally off-base and mildly embarrassing in retrospect. I don't know what business I had comparing one of the narrators of this novel to the \"unreliable narrators\" of \"Pale Fire\" and \"The Egyptologist.\" My guess is that I was actually misusing the phrase \"unreliable narrator,\" because \"Gentlemen and Players\" has no unreliable narrator.  So, shame on you, Lauren of three years ago!I enjoyed this book after picking it up again. The rough plot is that someone is wreaking havoc at a crusty old-boy prep school in England. That somebody is one of a handful of new teachers, someone who has a history with the school -- harkening back to childhood when they were an outsider, the progeny of the school \"porter.\" It's a sort of whodunit where the reader spends the novel guessing at this individual's identity. I actually knew from the beginning who the \"bad guy\" was, probably because three years ago when I first attempted to read the book and decided not to finish, I must have skimmed ahead (double shame on me!). But I enjoyed the book nonetheless. It isn't exactly deep, and for more insightful treatments of class at prep schools, I prefer \"Prep\" by Curtis Sittenfeld and \"Old School\" by Tobias Wolff. But this was a thriller and a decently-written one. I wouldn't classify it as \"literary,\" because although the writing was steady, the themes weren't particularly insightful or deep."}, {"userName": "Victoria", "userReviewDate": "Apr 01, 2010", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/3049657-victoria", "userReview": "Joanne Harris\u2019 novels have consistently impressed me since first discovering her. She\u2019s a great writer, and I just love the cadence of her prose and the wonderfully realistic characters that she presents in a vivid and rich setting. This more literary mystery of hers is no exception - it\u2019s an enjoyable and entertaining read. The \u201cevil\u201d narrator\u2019s real identity is not impossible to figure out before the end, but it doesn\u2019t detract from the fun in reading it, and adds that wonderful joy of being right.I also love it when books I read in random order seem to flow together. I read The Hummingbird's Daughter right before this, and had wished for a more smoother way to incorporate foreign language into the fiction. Harris does just that here with interjecting Latin phrases - but unlike Urrea, she includes a very handy glossary in the back of the book.

The other narrator tells an alternate tale of St. Oswalds as they constantly feel excluded from the prestige and decorum of the school and so starts the obsessive and intriguing game of revenge and destruction starting with the faculty and unfortunately my Mr Straitley..I was caught up with this book for a week and actually found myself slowing down, rereading and relishing the language and prose of this talented author.

I will say this much, I was hooked from the beginning; The plot for revenge by an outcast antihero. Going back and forth in narration between the PAWN, our schemer (with trips back into the past, and present) and the KING, the \"Classics\" Master, old centurion Mr. Roy Straitley, we find ourselves as readers woven into the murky history of St. Oswald's school for boys, and the lengths some will go to to destroy or preserve it.The darker the subject matter got, the more I found myself enjoying it, but there were too few instances of truly rich and masterful revenge. Most of the time, the book was muddled down by its boring middle portion. The plot to slowly dismantle St. Oswald's by our devious perpetrator is a somewhat remarkable one, but lacks a certain finesse. And the motivations behind it are (to quote an important character) far too \"banal.\" The incentive does not hold enough weight (in my eyes) for the ultimate modus operandi.Also, the twist that occurs during the climax happened to be one of the two routes I theorized it would go. The author does her best to throw you off, and had me thinking a third of the way through the novel that \"there's no way that it could be...\" But it turns out that it could, and it was. So, there was a sense of lacking any sort of powerful, shocking punch for me by the time the twist was revealed. By then, however, the book was starting to wind down. The ending dragged on and on, and just sort of fizzled out.Could a sequel be in the works? It's certainly a possibility given the circumstances of the ending. I doubt I'd give this story another go, though. All in all, it was a good book. I didn't loathe it, so that's a plus, but I didn't love it, either, and that disappoints me."}, {"userName": "Lindsay", "userReviewDate": "Sep 15, 2008", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/244939-lindsay", "userReview": "\"Gentlemen and Players\" may not be the best known of Joanne Harris's works, \"Chocolat\" undoubtedly holds that title, but this novel is a riveting story worthy of praise for its intelligence and ingenuity. Centered around the public (private for those of us in the US) St. Oswald's grammar school for boys where things begin to go terribly wrong - and we are not talking paper airplanes and spit balls disorder, more like school for scandal. As the school, and surrounding town, attempt to come to grips with the institution's unraveling, Harris weaves a set of plot twists that will have you flipping through the novel's pages trying to understand what you missed. This is a story of strategy and cunning shrouded in mystery and secrecy, which helps make up for several rather repetitive descriptions.Although satisfying, this novel is also disconcerting not only because of its subject matter, but also because Harris challenges readers to accept that not everything in life works out neatly according to the rules (no matter how badly we desire it). This novel will make you think and feel, which is truly something wonderful. Harris herself dedicated over a decade to teaching in the British school system and her devotion comes through clearly in every chapter, not to mention a lovely essay reflecting on her teaching career in the P.S. edition.One word of caution to readers before diving unreserved into this novel piece of literature - this is a story involving children and not everything that happens is good. If you are bothered by this type of thing, it might not be the choice for you.

It was fast paced and neat and every character was developed to a point where I felt satisfied and wanted to hear more of them.And then there were the twists! Impossible to say any more about them without spoiling, really, but I'll tell you that there were 20 pages in there that just one thing after the other had me gasping and shaking the book in front of me at the same time as being unable to pull my eyes from it.

It looked nice to have a book on my shelves that was normal, with simple people, no magicians, no genius children and so. Well, I have to admit that most of the books I thought they are simple, they are not. And this is an example.The book is telling the story of a young student. It's experiece. The way the school is working. And it's relationships with the people among it. It's family, its friends, its teachers.The book is also telling the story of a Latin teacher, who's been working for the school for several years. He tells us stories of his past and events that are happening to his life in the present.Meanwhile, there is somebody in the school, a teacher, an assistant, a student, no-one knows, who makes jokes, that put in danger many lives and many work spaces.As I said, this book is not normal. There are many travels back and forward to the past and the present as both of the main characters-the student and the teacher-are talking. When you read it, you have to be careful not to miss a spot. Mostly, when you follow the evidence correctly you understand the end before the book reveilles it. But this book was more complex than the others I've read on the past. You figure out the truth when the writer tells you so.This was the second book of Joanne Harris that I've read(the first was for young people). I wasn't sure at the beggining because Joanne Harris is also the writer of Chocolat (the book is been a movie with Johnny Depp). But it totally surpriced me. The book is not one of those that keep you in agony, because so many things are happening in, that after a point you understand that you have to sit back, relax and let the story reveille in front of you.And the end comes. And you're adsolutely sure who's who. You've guessed, you've followed the evidence, it doesn't matter. Cause the end is going to surprise you, no matter what.That's why I'm suggesting it to you.

Blackberry Wine, Chocolate, Coastliners and others from earlier in her career were very much tales about (and I think, for) women. Touched with magical realism and otherness, they had a warmth and hopefulness I haven\u2019t registered so much in more recent books. Gentleman and Players, like Blue Eyed Boy, has a riveting, page turning plot line that those earlier works did not posses though, engaging though they were.I\u2019ve mixed feelings. This was a fine read, a compelling story, but I do miss the old Joanne Harris. I\u2019m hoping that in a book or two\u2019s time, these two strands will blend together, and that we\u2019ll get back the inspirational heroines, and see them sitting in the more powerful and cunning plots.I love Harris\u2019s work, I\u2019ll follow wherever she goes though.
