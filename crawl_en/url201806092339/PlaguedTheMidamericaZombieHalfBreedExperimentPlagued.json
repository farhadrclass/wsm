This is the first installment in a trilogy, both quality writing and creatively imagined. A decade following the first of the zombie plague, America consists of a few walled \"Districts\" (compounds) for the wealthy, some agriculture and manufacturing, and a few enclaves where zombies are confined. The rest is barren--home to zombie populations. The confined are sold as slaves, for factories; not for field work, because they can't bear the light of day.The author doesn't blanch at zombie and hunter violence, but unlike many other stories of this ilk, it's not blood-drenched. Gore is not the focus: character and the very imaginative setting and background are the focus."}, {"userName": "Bailey", "userReviewDate": "Oct 22, 2013", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/22527850-bailey", "userReview": "\"I have your file, your picture. I know you like pictures. I'll tell your parents about you if I ever get out of here. In the meantime, just remember your name is Penelope Hope, and hope is a good thing.\"\n\t-TomPlease note that this book was given to KnightingaleReviews by the author in exchange for an honest review. Also, this is a collaborative project that was written with C.A young man by the name of Tom travels to the Plagued States of America, one of his few and only hopes that may lead him to finding his little sister Larissa. Years ago, when the zombie wave first hit, his younger sibling was ripped away from him. Larissa was unexpectedly bitten when Tom was supposed to be protecting her, an incident that he could never forget even if he tried. It is here in the Plagued States of America, particularly the area known as Biter Hill, where our troubled protagonist must search high and low twice a year for a hope that may never come to fruition. Biter Hill is where many individuals come to trade zombies that they've recently acquired and gander at the spectacles surrounding them, but only the zombie hunters are crazy enough to go near flesh eating, mindless humans. Even while the zombies seem harmless, you should never get too close to them. Used as slaves by modern day humanity, people are willing to use them despite the dangers. These ferocious beasts are kept in a prison at night, moaning until dawn. Placed and corralled like cattle, they are fenced in, never allowed to leave a heavily guarded area. Tom must look through the record books located at this zombie outpost. Perhaps he will see if his sister was brought here and finally fulfill his father's demands, or maybe something unexpectedly horrible will happen instead. When Tom meets Penelope, a half human/half zombie hybrid, he is naturally curious. Half-breeds are rare and a true site to see. While she appears distant and detached from the rest of the world, she's as fast as lightning and surprisingly intelligent. Her features are more human than zombie, and you could never tell her true nature unless you looked at her glazed eyes. Locked in a cage, she avoids Tom and rarely shows emotion. Despite Penelope's current feelings, Tom becomes seemingly more and more intrigued with her situation and her former self prior to this current zombie status. When Penelope catches a glimpse of a picture with Larissa on it, Tom knows that she is his only hope of finding her, no matter the outposts and their logs.Suddenly, as he is trying to depart back to his home, a horrible outbreak occurs. Zombies are getting out, running rampant, feeding off of every human that they can find, craving their flesh. So many perish. Zombie hunters, while many are present, are no match for the numerable waves of zombies that just keep flowing out of the prison, and only a few uninfected civilians make it out of this ordeal alive, including Tom. A group of zombie hunters picked him up out of the chaos along with several other men and women. They are led by Peske, the owner of the half-breed Penelope who is still under his thumb. Together, this group must make it out alive through the zombie ridden wasteland if they ever hope to make it safety. Tom promised Peske that if he got them to a certain point, he would call his father, a powerful Senator, who would have the power to help them receive a rescue team to fly them out of trouble. However, he was only willing to do this if Peske allowed him to borrow Penelope so that he could find his younger sister while they were waiting for assistance. In this day and age, zombie books are pumped out so often that the subject occasionally turns monotonous and feels so overused that the ideas are recycled time and time again. However, Plagued:The Midamerica Zombie Half-Breed Experiment was an amazing and refreshing zombie novel that all die hard lovers of the shuffling dead genre have to check out! The idea of half human/half zombie individuals was brilliantly executed! The mystery behind this subject unfolded quite well, and the answer to this secret was definitely unexpected. It was interesting to see how Better Hero Army created and breathed new life into a zombie world that had yet to be portrayed. While so many other stories in this genre are filled with nothing but chaos, his had a structure to it that involved several types of zombies. There were the half-breeds, a rare and fascinating topic to read about where we slowly discover their true nature during the book's entirety. Then we have the zombies who are selected and sold as slaves. These individuals are temporary disabled and, in a sense, operated upon, so that they cannot infect others with their contagious bite. Finally, we get to see the wild zombies that roam the land in search of meat to satisfy their insatiable hunger, and not only are there adult zombies but children are included in this group as well. Perhaps the children are just as compelling to read about as the half-breeds are. We don't want to spoil too much about the story so we'll just say that they don't kill for themselves and never age. There are so many aspects to this book that we thoroughly enjoyed. One of these includes how different the zombie hunters were portrayed compared to the everyday civilians. These two groups kept butting heads and definitely added a rich aspect to the book.\"How the hell do you guys do this for a living?\" Tyler asked.\"Hunting zombies? It's easy. No different than lions going into a herd of horned caribou. Any one of them could gore them lions, and the lions know it! But that don't stop them. It's when you start thinking like you're going to die, like you're prey. That's when you get yourself killed.\"-Peske As many have undoubtedly read, multiple zombie books have cataclysmic repercussions after the zombie apocalypse. Such worlds are often filled with lawless nations with gun-toting generic characters. However, Better Hero Army has interestingly enough constructed a zombie after effect that possesses a mostly high functioning human society that has learned to control the zombie outbreak, instead of letting it rule their lives. Zombies, while dangerous, also provide jobs for a large range of individuals who are willing to expose themselves to the danger that zombie hunting harbors. A cure is now on the way, but how they are figuring out the means to the end is part of the government's many dirty little secrets.If you are looking for a survival book, this is a possible option for you. We loved the descriptions contained in Plagued. For example, fireflies coated the scenery beyond the main scene. While many saw glowing insects, these glowing lights were really the eyes of the walking dead, slowly advancing on the group hoping to catch a meal. Can you imagine the chills after reading that?Overall, there are so many things to love in Better Hero Army's first installment in the Plagued States of America series to possibly write about. The journey to find Tom's sister and the guilt ridden conscious that he endured throughout this novel was a story worth telling. The ending was a shocker to us. It was not what we were expecting. It was both heartbreaking and uplifting at the same time. How is this possible?

Tom is a young man forced to go with his brother, Gary, to try to find his younger sister, Larissa. Tom blames himself (as does his father) for allowing Larissa to be turned into a zombie 10 years before. While Tom and Gary are in the zombie trading area, havoc breaks loose as the zombies become free.The idea that the government would \"cure\" zombies in order for them to be used as slave labor is unique. What better way to get free workers than to use zombies? Of course, when you have slaves, you also have slave traders, who also seem to function as zombie hunters.Tom meets a young woman who is a half-breed zombie and decides to use her to find his sister. Questions arise: can he trust Penelope to not hurt him? Can he find Larissa? And, most importantly, can Penelope be cured?The story was entertaining, but left me with a lot of unanswered questions about what made half-breed zombies. I don't know if there are more books in this series that explain things better, but I would like to know more. All in all, an interesting book if you love zombies."}, {"userName": "Books", "userReviewDate": "Jan 20, 2014", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/6665735-books", "userReview": "This captivating book with its refreshing take on what an outbreak of zombies could entail, turned out to be a read-through-in-one-go for me. Compelled by his father, his brother Gary, and his own feeling of guilt, Tom ventures into the zombie plagued states to search for his sister, Larissa. When the zombie trading post is cast into chaos, Tom uses his status as senator's son and the survival of a group of zombie hunters, a half breed, and some tourists, to reach his goal.I call Plagued a refreshing read because it is not the usual zombie apocalypse and world being overrun with hordes of zombies scenario. In this case the zombies are contained and controlled and, barring accidents, the general population is safe from them. There even seems to be a way to make them safe for use in the states which are not zombie infested.Full of nonstop adventure and a great deal of edge-of-your-chair suspense, this slightly dystopian novel is definitely one of the very best of its kind, and, thank heavens, not another Hunger Games look alike.The characters, especially the main characters, are skilfully crafted, fleshed out and realistic. Tom, as ultimate main character, is particularly realistic for a young man with a guilt complex; the desire to do the right thing and the doubts that any person should have in the kind of situation that presents itself to him. Life or death decisions are part of the zombie hunters' daily existence. Tom however, must make a similar decision and that on a much more personal level.For a read filled with adventure, a few thoroughly horrific incidents and a touching deal of tenderness, I recommend Plagued as an absolute must-read. I sincerely hope that we'll see much more of Evan Ramspott's brilliant writing in the near future.

It can't be that bad then, right? For only Cassandra Clare can write crap in 53 installments and still make a profit out of it. Other people would go bust.Better Hero Army knows this. Rather, Evan Ramspott knows this. And as he is still writing stuff, although under unusual pseudonym, I imagine his works are getting better and better.His publishers like what he's writing, as they are contemplating turning this entire series into audiobooks, so I imagine story will continue on a positive trend.Here we have two brothers entering the risky zone of zombies. They are looking for their long-abandoned sister, bitten by zombies a very long time ago.I guess guilt takes about 10 years to fully kick in, as that's when they finally decide to drop the security of their awesome lives as sons of a mighty senator and go look for their little zombie sister.In this world, getting bitten by a zombie isn't an immediate death penalty as it's possible to get pumped full of inhibitors which can slow/stop/reverse the process, depending on the individual. As a result, people aren't that afraid of them, and employ them as a workforce. Or security. Or... something else.Naturally, you have dealers/suppliers present who'll make money in this process of good, old-fashioned, slave trade.While zombies aren't really terribly useful slaves, as one would expect, there are half-breeds who may be. Half-breeds are a kind of a cross between humans and zombies.Nobody is sure how this really works - whether an inhibited zombie bite victim, pregnant bite victim, government experiment or something else - but nobody cares either. There's a good money to be made in the trade.Better Hero Army isn't spoon-feeding you information, which I liked very much. If you miss a dialogue or fail to recognize signs and come to own conclusions, you may be kept guessing for a while. Eventually, characters will connect the dots so you're not going to miss anything, but you'll have a feeling of exploring the world on your own, rather than watching a summer blockbuster movie which spells things out for you.There are still plenty of things we haven't found an answer for. But that's where the sequel kicks in. Despite a few shortcomings the book #1 has, I must admit I'm looking forward to it. It's been over a year since first part was made into an audiobook, so I hope intentions of recording other parts as well is real.Andrew Wehrlen did a great job narrating the book and I'd be happy to see him back in the sequel.Overall, 4* with a chance of sunny days.This book has been provided to me free of charge by the publisher."}, {"userName": "Patrick D'Orazio", "userReviewDate": "Jan 01, 2014", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/4328815-patrick-d-orazio", "userReview": "Plagued: The Midamerica Zombie Half-Breed Experiment is a mouthful of a name for a novella written by Evan Ramspott. The story introduces us to Tom and Gary, brothers who have come to the town of Biter Hill, one of the few locations within the Plagued States where the zombie slave trade occurs, to search out records on their lost sister, Larissa, who was infected ten years earlier and who may have come through the town as a slave at one point. Thorough records are kept on the zombies who pass through and they have been ordered by their father, a powerful senator, to find her. They return to this same place, year in and year out, in an effort to fulfill their father\u2019s wishes. Tom feels guilt for what happened to Larissa, since she was in his care when she was bitten. But Tom was twelve at the time, and had no experience with dealing with zombies. He struggles with the idea that he shouldn\u2019t be held responsible, but feels guilty nonetheless. It doesn\u2019t help that his father and brother both blame him, in their own particular ways, for what happened. Tom comes across a half-breed zombie in a slaver\u2019s cage while in Biter\u2019s Hill. She looks like a normal uninfected human. There are claims that half-breeds are creatures born of a human who is infected while pregnant, some other, unknown reason for their existence seems more likely. Though she is savage, there is a connection between the creature and Tom. She also seems rather interested in the picture of his sister when she sees it. Tom is separated from his brother when the prison in Biter Hill maintaining most of the zombies who are being held for the slave trade has a breakout. Tom has to flee with several zombie hunters and slave traders at that point; including the one who has the half-breed who Tom has discovered is named Penelope. Together, they must enter into the wastelands in an effort to find their way to another place of safety. Tom suspects that Penelope knows something about his missing sister and uses his clout as a senator\u2019s son to get the ragged band of survivors to head to a place where he believes Larissa have migrated to in the decade since she\u2019d turned with the promise of rescue and wealth if they do. And he is going to need Penelope\u2019s help to find her.Plagued is definitely a different type of zombie apocalypse tale. It is focused on Tom\u2019s personal journey and the relationship he forms with Penelope along the way. The craggy old slave trader Peske was probably my favorite character though, as someone who is gruff and seemingly uncaring about anyone else, he does what it takes to keep everyone alive and seems to have a soft spot for his half-breed who he insists isn\u2019t for sale. Tom is well developed as a character and Penelope, as a confused creature of two worlds generates both intrigue and sympathy. It\u2019s clear that this will be the first of perhaps a series of zombie stories set in this world, and this is a positive start. The zombies themselves are fairly Romero-esque and traditional, but the introduction of half-breeds other factors like potential cures and being able to eliminate a zombie\u2019s ability to spread infection once they are captured adds some unique elements to this saga. This is a quick read and the world the author created, long past the initial terrifying days of the zompcalypse, had an air of believability to it as the survivors adapt and cope with the fact that the undead are most likely a permanent fixture in their universe."}, {"userName": "Melissa B", "userReviewDate": "Oct 29, 2013", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/7581245-melissa-b", "userReview": "Let me preface this review by stating that I received a free copy of this book in exchange for an honest review. I'm a lover of all things zombie. I love reading new books about them, because many times the author has a completely different take on how the zombie apocalypse occurred. This one sat on my to-read list for awhile, and I'm sad that it did. The story follows Tom Jefferson, the son of a senator as he goes to Biter's Hill with his brother Gary in what feels like is the impossible task of finding their sister Larissa - who was bitten when she was eight years old. Biter's Hill appears to be both a tourist destination and a place where zombie hunters \"de-fang\" the zombies and sell them as slaves. By de-fanging the zombies (basically removing the salivary glands), they are no longer contagious, but they are still dangerous - as they will still hunt and eat humans. While there to hunt through the books to find his sister, Tom sees an oddity - a half-breed. Eventually the zombies break free of their prison and all hell breaks loose at Biter's Hill. Tom barely manages to escape on the duck owned by the owner of the half-breed girl with several others. Before everything went sour, Tom had managed to find the half-breed's name and information. The group makes their way to an airstrip in Midamerica, deep within the zombie territory, in order to try to contact the District - where Tom's father can and will send a rescue team. While en route, he figures out how to communicate with the half-breed and learns that the airstrip is where the half-breeds and the zombie children live. The zombie children apparently do not know how to hunt and are cared for by the half-breeds. He also figures out how the half-breeds have been created. The story itself is pretty well written. The zombies are not rotting corpses but pale, almost albino-like, creatures that detest sunlight. They moan to draw other zombies to their prey, and they descend upon humans in hordes. I am definitely looking forward to reading the next book in the series."}, {"userName": "Kat Desi", "userReviewDate": "Sep 03, 2015", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/23841672-kat-desi", "userReview": "A unique and interesting take on Zombie Apocalypse! In Better Hero Army's world, there is such a thing as a zombie slave trade. There is also such a thing as half-breed zombies. Tom and Gary are brothers who are looking for their sister, Larissa, who had been infected many years ago. Biter's Hill is where the slave trading happens, so the brothers travel there to find out any more information about their sister. It's also where a certain half-breed slave had caught Tom's eye (figuratively speaking--I had to point that out considering we're talking zombies and all) and he had a feeling that this half-breed knew where to find their sister... The thrill starts as a horde falls upon Biter's Hill and Tom was stuck with a few other survivors, and thankfully, including the half-breed. As a Senator's son, Tom had privileges and he could easily get rescued along with the others but not now when there's a possibility that he could see his sister again... Wow, firstly, this was a very well written novella. I really enjoyed this author's writing. An unpopular opinion, I'm not very crazy about zombies, so this was a new territory for me. I enjoyed this because this author provided something new. I went through this book in a jiff--probably half a day or see with some breaks in between. I did not expect the ending.

I thought this was a fantastic start to what is sure to be a thrilling series! The story flowed with a steady pace and the twist of the half-breeds really peaked my interest. My only negative is I wish it were longer. Andrew Wehrlen was a good narrator, easy to understand with identifiably different character voices. I am eager to read/listen to more in this series especially to learn more about Penelope.

The woman on the cover looked pretty and disturbed, plus the title was awesome; Plagued: The Midamerica Zombie Half-Breed Experiment. I was really interested because there is a ton of zombie, apocalyptic books out there, but I have never heard of a \u201chalf-breed\u201d zombie so this was a cool new concept. I was also looking for a short read something that wasn\u2019t going to take too much time to complete.I didn\u2019t realize how tiny this book would be until I got it in the mail. It\u2019s a mini book, a half-book for the half-zombie. The cover also has that cool smooth texture that some books have; it feels like a cross between a smooth stone or soft rubber. I\u2019ve seen more and more books doing this but it\u2019s still pretty unique to me so that was a nice.This book was fun to read. It wasn\u2019t complex or super in-depth, just a great zombie book which is really what I wanted. I loved the main character Tom, and like him quickly became attached and curious about Penelope or \u201cKitty\u201d the half-breed. My only complaint was that you didn\u2019t really get to know anyone else, so I had a hard time feeling bad when other people got eaten, it was kinda like, \u201coh so and so just died\u2026oh well at least Toms ok\u2026.\u201dThis book was very interesting straight from the start; I didn\u2019t have to try to get into it. There was a point in the middle where I wasn\u2019t 100 percent involved; but like I said, it was mainly due to my lack of remorse for the victims the zombies were eating. It\u2019s a small book, so the slump didn\u2019t last long and quickly picked up to more disturbing new concepts of the zombie children. I liked the idea that like with the living, the dead children relied on adults to help them as well; It was very creepy. That\u2019s all I\u2019ll say for now I really don\u2019t want to give too much away.I would definitely recommend this book, so if your wondering, you should read it. I love short books because I can read them over again; and I will with this. It ended where you can tell there is a second book, and it\u2019s out now. Its called Plauged: The Rock Island Zombie Counteractant ExperimentI will for sure read it, but it\u2019s not on my \u201choly shit I need to get it right this second list\u201d; for me this was a cool relaxing read and I will most likely save the second book for when I\u2019m in the mood for that again. I\u2019ve had a busy schedule the past few weeks, and have had no brain cells to spare on thinking so this short, straight forward, fun zombie book was just the thrill I needed.There is also a third installment in this series coming out from better hero army soon also make sure to follow along with our Chapter DiscussionsListen to my author interview with Better Hero Armys Evan Ramspott on Goodreadsmadreads Radio on ITunes and Stitcher Radio"}, {"userName": "Jack", "userReviewDate": "Mar 11, 2017", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/5088081-jack", "userReview": "An interesting read, especially the concept of the half-breed with different zombie-skill-set.

When the outbreak first started, before the walls went up, there was absolute chaos, and in that mess Tom's sister was bitten and turned. Ever since, Tom has been blamed by his father and his brother Gary for what happened. Twice a year, Tom and Gary travel to Biter's Hill, a trading outpost where zombies are brought to be logged and sold as mindless slaves. There, they pour over dozens of log books, searching for their sister's face. Their father would give anything to have his baby girl back, still clinging to the hope of finding a cure. It's during this trip that Tom discovers Penelope, a strange half-human, half-zombie. It's also during this trip that the zombies break lose and overrun the outpost. Suddenly, Tom finds himself stranded in Midamerica with Penelope and a band of other survivors. Tom hopes that with Penelope's help he can find his sister and maybe assemble a rescue mission before the zombies close in and tear them limb from limb. I haven't started a series in a long time...I've been on a stand-alone marathon, I guess. I also haven't read a zombie book in awhile, and even though they absolutely terrify me (irrationally), I love them. Plagued: The Midamerica Zombie Half-Breed Experiment is an interesting take on the whole zombie apocalypse craze. We typically think of zombies as shells of the person they once were. In Plagued, however, there are half-breeds, zombies that have been experimented on and administered a possible cure. Although they are not brought back from the dead, they are clearly more human than the full-on zombies, kind of like R in Warm Bodies. The writing was sometimes a little hard to follow, but the plot was interesting and fast-paced. I thought the characters needed to be a little more developed; I liked Tom and Penelope, sometimes Hank and Peske, but I didn't really care about anyone else. Like, when a member of the survivors died, I just kind of shrugged and said eh, and kept reading. It didn't really hit me too hard like the death of a character normally does.Oh, and I really liked the cover - very simple with a gorgeous model (even though she is half-dead) and helped me picture Penelope in the story.The book was quite short and made for a quick read. Although it didn't end with a cliffhanger, I'm still curious to see where book 2 will pick up and where the story will go from there. Not bad!*I read and reviewed a galley edition of the novel \u2013 if anything is misquoted in comparison to the published version, please let me know."}, {"userName": "Deb", "userReviewDate": "Jul 17, 2014", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/17142157-deb", "userReview": "Not having read much in the way of zombie fiction, I was not sure what I would find in The Midamerica Zombie Half-Breed Experiment besides the usual story of survival against the ravening zombie hoard. I was quite pleasantly surprised, as the book has a lot to offer in its novella sized page count. The story takes place in a post zombie apocalypse world, where the existence of zombies has become a part of everyday life. The contagion has been contained, and zombies can be \"defanged\", losing their contagiousness. Further, they are hunted and enslaved, being able to learn simple, unskilled tasks, and becoming an economic base for the surviving human civilization. Tom, the POV, is being handed the task of searching for his lost younger sister, Larissa, who had been turned ten years previously, during the first wave of contagion. Burdened with guilt by his father and older brother for his inability to save her, he travels to the zombie trading town of Biters Hill to search for her among the records of slave zombies who have passed through the town. While there, he makes a connection with a captive half-breed named Penelope (or \"Kitty\", her slave name). Following a prison breakout, Tom, Penelope, her keeper Peske, and a small number of survivors escape to the wastelands to search for a way to safety. The bond forming between Tom and Penelope becomes the heart of the story, and, eventually, she becomes central in his search for Larissa.I found the main characters to be quite well drawn. Tom is an interesting, complex person, haunted by guilt and questioning of the morality of the zombie slave trade, which is interesting given the place of the zombie slave trade in this world and his own status within it. Penelope is an intriguing character, a half-breed zombie/human, savage, but with the capacity to form an emotional bond with Tom and with the intelligence and ability to communicate with those who are patient enough to try. Also of note is her keeper, the slave trader Peske. While he is thoroughly businesslike about the trade in zombies, it becomes evident that he is Penelope's protector as well as keeper, as she is in danger from both humans and zombies. Other characters are rather perfunctory, as the length of the book does not allow for much character development. All, however, are realistic, and act accordingly.At 162 pages, the book is a quick read. My main gripe is that it is far too short. It is clearly the first installment in a series of stories, and the interesting background the author tantalizes us with just calls for more depth and detail. There are moral complexities involved with the zombie slave trade and the origin of the half-breeds that call out for examination, and I would really like to see the interactions of the Jefferson family. Hopefully, these threads will continue into the next installment and be expanded on.My thanks to the Goodreads First Reads program for providing me with the opportunity to read and review this book."}, {"userName": "Kathleen R.", "userReviewDate": "Jan 23, 2017", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/8063169-kathleen-r", "userReview": "Title: Plagued: The Midamerica Zombie Half Breed Author: Better Army Hero 4 unexpected stars \nResident Evil meets I Am Legend meets The Walking Dead. That's what automatically comes to mind when I think about Plagued by Better Hero Army. It's not a romance novel, nor is it a novel that spares any details when it comes to describing the life of the post apocalyptic world that has the human race having to deal and fight off zombies. Only some zombies have evolved and have some capacity to understand speech and can speak, known as Half Breeds. Ten years after the disappearance of his sister, Tom goes out to search for her at his father's insistence. Meeting a group of veterans, zombie hunters who know where to look and can make sure he can survive, Tom meets Kitty, a Half Breed, who just might know where to start his search and where his sister is.  3 cuddle worthy dreams \nThis is a novel that draws you in - not because of the gore or the zombie apocalypse, but because of the attention to details, because of the way that the story plays out and how the story pulls you right in, keeping you at the edge of your seat.
