I picked it up mostly because of the blurbs on the back, authors I trust not to lie to me said glowing things. I was only 30 pages in when I called the local bookstore to order the other books in the series. I like Kadrey's writing. It doesn't feel like he's trying desperately to impress me. It doesn't feel like he's trying to mimic the big powers in Urban Fantasy Butcher, Harris, Briggs, whoever the current flavor is. Kadrey is playing his own game here, and there's a sort of \"fuck you\" attitude to the whole book that I really enjoyed. Also, the language is gorgeous. Not lyrical and arty. Kadrey has a way of phrasing things that left me smiling and chuckling to myself in public. That's a rarity for me these days...."}, {"userName": "Will Byrnes", "userReviewDate": "Jul 08, 2009", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/1526851-will-byrnes", "userReview": "Having recently exited Hell, Stark is rather peeved at those who had sent him there for eleven years, and is eager for revenge. He has a fondness for stealing cars and making mayhem. Los Angeles comes in for some laugh-out-loud funny noir treatment. Richard Kadrey - from his site Richard Kadrey has created a world not unlike Kim Harrison\u2019s Inderland, a blended world in which the magical and non-magical co-exist. I love Kadrey\u2019s dark sense of humor, which reminds me very much of the Hell Boy series and Christopher Moore\u2019s vampire books. I suppose it might be argued that Sandman Slim is derivative, but the weaving of magical and the real has become a staple and what counts more is how the tale is told. In Sandman Slim it is told very well. Kadrey maintains our interest by adding bigger-picture detail to Stark\u2019s personal mission. There is a nice cast of supporting characters here, including a centuries old French alchemist, a spider-like person who survives by liquefying humans and drinking them, angels, anti-angels, magicians and at least one video store clerk who aspires to a bit more from life. If you thought that having one\u2019s head cut off would be a conversation killer, think again. Kadrey has filled his stage with impressive props, magical weapons, potions, tools and pathways. This is a fast-paced fun read from start to finish. Thankfully Kadrey has kept at it and there are several more volumes if this one doesn\u2019t leave you steaming in a very warm place.=============================EXTRA STUFFLinks to the author\u2019s personal, Twitter, FB and Tumblr pagesThe Barnes and Noble Sci-Fi Fantasy Blog has a feature in which various writers tell about shows or movies that go particularly well with their novels.

Rarely have I encountered a main character so loaded with ANGSTY RAGENESS and OMNIDIRECTIONAL BADITUDE as James Stark (aka Sandman Slim). I mean this guy is full of  ARRRRRRRRRRGGGGHHHH!...and it works...mostly. Now let me say at the outset that I don\u2019t read a ton of Keith Urban Fantasy. I enjoy The Dresden Files on a casual, non-rabid, basis and despite wanting to bitch-slap the main character for his all too often bouts of annoying. I really liked The Devil You Know and plan on reading more of that series and I am absolutely Cocoa Puff Coo Coo for the Monster Hunter International series. To that rather scrawny list, I now add the Sandman Slim series which I plan to continue reading as I think it has serious upside potential. Here\u2019s the skinny:In a world where magic and supernatural creatures are known to exist, Stark was a powerful magician in love with the only woman who ever really accepted him for who he was. Life was sitting pretty...until Stark was betrayed by a group of his magician \u201cfriends\u201d who had him literally sent to Hell in exchange for power, wealth and other assorted knick knacks. Oh, and the magic-wielding chunk-o-turds also decided to go ahead and kill the love of his life. Can anyone else see the rage clouds of the revenge storm beginning to form? Flashforward 11 years later\u2026.Stark is back from Hell and the experience seems to have been pretty handy. He\u2019s not only survived but managed to pick up some new skills (including virtual invulnerability), a few demon-built go go gadgets and increased his overall badassery quotient exponentially. To make matters worse for the assbaskets that betrayed him, his pissed off meter has also undergone a round of steroid therapy and is glued on red. Stark is back from Hell for revenge on the six who sent him there, especially the head of the group named Mason himself has become mega powerful thanks to arranging Stark's little tour of Hell. This is the UF genre\u2019s take on hardcore noir fiction. Stark is a paranormalfied version of your typical noirtastic main character. In fact, Stark\u2019s name and the fact that one of the main bad guys is named Parker are pretty clear homage to noir fiction giant, Donald Westlake and his Parker novels (which he wrote under the name Stark).I liked the world-building and Stark's revenge quest has him bumping into all kinds of bump in the night baddies as well as Nazi skin heads with demonic weaponry, and a team from Homeland Security sporting soem serious angelic firepower. There are no real good guys in the cosmic battle ground and ever the angels are played with huge streaks of gray in them. Stark has nothing but contempt for both sides and treats them all with a hearty \u201cfuck yourself\u201d as he sees them as two sides of the same crooked coin. I liked Stark's \"you can kill me but you can't control me and I promise you'll limp when its over\" mindset. This is espcially true when dealing with the \"good\" angels who he holds in special contempt. His anger lacede, expletive topped tirades at what they and their Boss have allowed to happen on Earth are some of the best moments in the book. Dark yes, blasphemous, oh yeah...but seriously compelling reading. In the end, I liked Stark and the fact that he never really mellowed during the book. You are in his head throughout the book and so you know he is not really \u201cevil\u201d and so it is easy to like the guy. He has a moral code (if seriously jaded and rough around the edges) and he looks out for his friends. It did take me a while to warm-up to him as he spent way to much time telegraphing his dumb mistakes and vacationing in the land of self-pity that the he seemed to be spiraling down to doucheville. However, he recovered nicely and when it finally came down to knocking heads around, he was a one man force of nature that was pure fun to watch. By the end of the book I was sold on Stark's potential as a really good character. His inner monologues and outer tirades were often spiced with heavy doses of funny and I liked the overall tone of the story. The writing was good and certainly didn\u2019t detract from the story-telling. 3.5 stars for this one and high hopes for future installments."}, {"userName": "Orient", "userReviewDate": "Feb 14, 2018", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/43587353-orient", "userReview": "[\nHe changed, right in front of us.

This is one of those books for me. I really liked it, but found myself picking some serious nits while reading it.Stark was a magician (a real magician, not a sawing-a-woman-in-half kind) who was madly in love with his girlfriend Alice when he was betrayed by another magician named Mason and some others. Mason managed to send Stark to hell, but as a living person, not a dead soul. 11 years later, Stark learns that Alice has been murdered on Earth by Mason and his pals. Determined to get revenge, Stark breaks out of hell with a magical key that allows him to access almost any point in any dimension. His stay in hell has made him supernaturally tough with an extremely bad attitude, but he soon runs across various angels, demons, monsters, alchemists, magicians, Nazi skin-heads and porn shop owners that he has to deal with as he learns that there may be something much bigger than his revenge at stake.This had a great concept with a lot of original ideas and some terrific action. Mixing magic with various weapons, including shotguns, makes for some awesome carnage when thing really get rolling.However, for the first 250 pages or so, Stark just comes across as an unlikeable asshole who blunders about warning his enemies he's back and generally getting his ass kicked. (I've noticed a common factor among supernatural characters like Harry Dresden or Joe Pitt that three-quarters of the books seem to consist of them getting beaten to a pulp by various beasties and this book continues that trend.) The first half of this book consists mainly of Stark complaining about all the clothes he's ruined by getting repeatedly abused.The author has a bad habit of having Stark do stupid things, that he acknowledges as stupid, just to advance the plot and it's just chalked up to him being 'impulsive'. Plus, there are some serious logic gaps. Stark can access any point in any dimesion with his supernatural key. Yet, he seems to prefer stealing cars. And when he needs to dispose of a body, he steals yet another car and thinks about how many chances he's taking as he drops the body in the La Brea tar pits. Why wouldn't he just use the key and take the body to Antartica or the middle of the Amazon and just dump it? It doesn't help that he uses the key about 5 seconds after dumping the body.However, the ending redeemed this book a lot. When the action finally starts, it gets massive in scale and imaginative in how weapons and magic could be blended. Stark become a bad-ass anti-hero instead of a whining jerk, and the ending sets up a lot of possibilities. I hope future ones are more like the second half of the book and less like the first half.Oh, and for you Donald Westlake fans, the main character's name is Stark and one of the bad guys is named Parker.

I don't mind antiheroes, if their good antiheroes.

The \"protagonist\" opens the book having sneaked out of hell apparently having learned nothing from the experience. I mean hell seems to be pretty much pointless. The first thing the guy informs us is that he hates cops and hero types...but sometimes he has to intervene and do the \"right thing\". He's explaining why he intervened in a brutal carjacking...shameful for any tough, mouthy, antihero. I just couldn't get involved with this guy or his story.Maybe I'm too old and have read too much of this crap...but enjoy it if you like.

Kadrey tries to come across all hard-boiled but the book reads as if the author was just as addicted to Buffy the Vampire Slayer and Angel as I was. straightforward writing with snarky, snappy dialogue that is often so on the nose that it made me wince, but also often a lot of breezy fun. there's much rushing back and forth and appearing in places suddenly (yay, magic) and swift reversals of fortune and just as swift reclamations of fortune; Kadrey keeps the pace popping but makes sure the story remains clear and the mysteries remain intriguing and engaging. I particularly enjoyed our hero's angst and irritation over his limited clothing options because I often feel similarly, although not usually because my clothes have been bloodied and burnt due to slaughtering various enemies (only sometimes). I also quite liked that talking head named Kasabian; possibly because I also like the band Kasabian. overall the book is a light delight and quite easy going down. fans of Urban Fantasy probably have already read this; if not, they should be reading this series as soon as possible."}, {"userName": "Felicia", "userReviewDate": "Dec 30, 2009", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/666892-felicia", "userReview": "Men, you want hard-boiled urban fantasy?

Hell, I don\u2019t even need a running mate. I suppose I could leave it at that, and just walk away, probably leaving more than a few of you scratching your heads. But I might as well expound upon my point, because once you start shoveling shit you might as well keep going.You see, James Stark is a character I\u2019m not supposed to like. In fact, he burns jackets, kills people (bad ones), and even manages to piss off a few angels just for fun. He\u2019s the kind of guy you\u2019re better off pretending you don\u2019t know. If he does happen to come around, you barricade your front door, and then you call the fuzz. If the cops can\u2019t keep him at bay, then you leave LA (it\u2019s filled with people more fucked up than Stark anyway), and head somewhere safer like Mexico or Colombia.Despite all of that, though, I actually liked the bastard. I rooted for him to rein hell-on-earth and kick the shit out of evil, and ruin a few more coats. I could almost feel his hatred coursing through my veins, and rather than be turned off, I was actually a little turned on. To be fair, it wasn\u2019t all fireflies and sparklers, and I did manage to cringe once or twice, based on yet another terrible path he took. But if I didn\u2019t see at least a fault or two, I\u2019d probably be in more trouble than I already am. So maybe there\u2019s the slimmest of slim chances I\u2019m not completely fucked up.In the spirit of Stark smashing a few faces, SANDMAN SLIM smashed together more than one genre, and made it work. The plot and dialogue raced forward (other than enough editing errors that I couldn\u2019t help but notice); all the characters were filled with warm and gooey goodness (smirks); the action made it seem as though I was driving on two-wheels down Wilshire Boulevard (without traffic); and I even discovered another reason to hate a junkie or two (when you read it, you\u2019ll see what I mean).Like this novel so aptly proves time and again: What doesn\u2019t kill you makes you stronger.I received this book for free at Left Coast Crime.Cross-posted at Robert's Reads"}, {"userName": "Scott Sigler", "userReviewDate": "Mar 21, 2016", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/1782315-scott-sigler", "userReview": "A kick-ass book.

Instead of a \"serial killer who kills serial killers,\" you have a \"monster that kills monsters.\" That was one of the few angles of this book that didn't work for me, though, as the main character is human an a \"monster\" only in spirit. Kadrey has a gift for PULP FICTION-esque dialogue, rapid-fire and full of creative insults. This is book one of a series that seems destined to follow the Sookie Steakhouse / Harry Dresden / Buffy Summers route of one Big Bad after another, all slightly escalating the stakes, as each subsequent tale builds to the ultimate big bad somewhere down the road.

Stark has quite a chip on his shoulder: He was sent to Hell at age 19 and has languished there for 11 years. Stark is out for revenge and wants to kill those responsible for his time \u201cDowntown.\u201dTold from Stark\u2019s point of view, the narrative voice combines a wicked sense of humor with irreverence, snark, and the need to get even with those who wronged him. Stark is a complex character: He is still grieving the death of his first love Alice. At the same time, there doesn\u2019t seem to be a car in L.A. that cannot be hotwired by Stark. Stark is adept at all kinds of weapons use. He is also a magician, but he hesitates to use his magic for fear of attracting the attention of the Hellions. Stark is also difficult to kill, a definite asset in his world. The world building is quite extensive and the use of L.A. and its\u2019 seedy side adds a dark, urban feel to this book. Stark\u2019s memories of his time in Hell and his descriptions of the various factions at war there add color and texture to the narrative. I was also impressed by the variety of different paranormal creatures. While there were the usual angels, demons, and vampires, there were also the Kissi \u2013 a freaky kind of fallen angel. One of my favorite characters was a Jade \u2013 a kind of vampire with shark teeth. The eclectic mix of characters makes this book very interesting. I loved Vidocq, Stark\u2019s old friend and companion. Allegra, the Goth video store clerk was a surprising character. Candy the Jade was a perfect partner for Stark. The story is well paced and there are some fantastic action sequences that kept me on the edge of my seat. Stark and his friends like their guns and know how to use them.

Our protagonist gets sent bodily to hell, somehow manages to survive for 11 years, then gets embedded with a magic key that lets him go anywhere, and comes back for revenge after they kill his girl.There are some interesting concepts - a bit of a twist that the guy coming back from Hell is still actually alive, some cool weaponry, like the na'at which is a weapon from Hell which is pretty mutatable, some magical stuff, so on and so forth.But the writing's pretty terrible. I mean, even for a pulp book. It was very jumpy. More than once I wondered if I was missing a page or a chapter or something, because he'd be cleaning up bodies, and then thinking of gum. (Ok, not a real example, but you get the general idea.)And he's pretty one-note - all of the characters are - and he's constantly flying off half-cocked and doing stupid things and getting other people hurt and just generally being a ponce. (The author makes some nods at trying to explain some of this. He time in Hell gave him impulse control problems, for instance, but it was pretty damn annoying to read about it over and over and over again.)All in all, it wasn't terrible and I wouldn't say \"Oh dear gods, no, don't read this book!\", but I'm less than motivated to read any more of it (especially since I've heard the sequel's \"not as good\" as the first.)In a way it's unfortunate because the last third of the book, after the rather anti-climactic big battle, the things that were there to sort of set-up the continuation actually started getting somewhat more interesting. Not enough, though, for me to check it out.I do think it had some interesting concepts and characters, though, especially if they're developed a bit more, but I think it could work much better as a movie or as a comic because the narration is really the worst part of the whole thing."}, {"userName": "Ariel", "userReviewDate": "Apr 17, 2017", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/22465719-ariel", "userReview": "\"Don't be modest, we've all heard of you. Sandman Slim-the monster who kills monsters.\"In an effort to regain control over my TBR and my Audible account, I made an excellent executive decision to re-listen to Sandman Slim and I think I enjoyed myself so much more this second time around.Richard Stark is the anti-hero of all anti-heroes, a self-centered jackass of a magician sent to hell by his magicians circle in exchange for all sorts of excellent power. Instead of dying, which is what everyone, including the denizens and generals of hell and hell's army expected, Stark was thrown into the Pits to fight the monsters of hell, Gladiator style. Eleven years of fighting demons and darkness can do a number on a person and it reflects in Stark when he's able to drag his smoking ass up and claw his way back to the the world.This guy is a total asshole. He's unfriendly, rude, focused on his mission of revenge and vengeance and has no room in his life for anything but smokes and booze. But honestly, don't let that fool you, because Stark is definitely one of those truffles that has the hidden ooey, gooey center that tries to hide that fact. He's a fabulous jerkwad and I adore his grinchy little heart.Richard Kadrey created a fabulous pulp-fiction noir seedy underbelly anti-hero goodness. It's over the top in the best ways, with some humor that had me literally giggling out loud. My husband, who only knows that this \"Supernatural the TV show on roids\", overheard me listening to this for about a minute long and laughed out loud as well. He had no idea what was happening or who was who, he just knew the goodness of raunchy humor and sailor talk.I'll also be honest and admit I love a good \"good vs. evil\" battle. Angels and demons fighting for the control of humanity and the universe is always a good read because I feel each writer really does put their own individual spin on it, and I really enjoyed Kadrey's. This world building and story telling is unique and interesting and keeps me entertained above all. The narrator, GOD BLESS YOU MACLEOD ANDREWS, your voice is cigarettes, gravel and whiskey all rolled into one. Literally one of the best narrators because he just FITS Stark so well! The narration for the other voices and cast of character is also top notch and very well done. I really enjoy the hesitancy that's projected into Candy and the over the top Texan accent for the non-Texan Wells. Plus, they do some great audio work in overlapping voices when demons are involved and it really adds to the atmosphere.The only downside to audio as a medium is that I'm not quite sure on the correct spelling for quite a few of the characters, and I'd really rather not go hunting down for names. I will say that everyone you are introduced to is interesting and adds to the story. There are no side characters that are added for us additions sake, but everyone is important to the story. I highly recommend Sandman Slim to anyone that is either in the mood for a laugh, or is looking to try something new in a genre they haven't read before. This is a great urban fantasy with pulp-noir overtones and a side of comedy and irreverent humor that will get you giggling against your will. I also highly recommend giving this a shot as audiobook as the narration is just fantastic and adds so well to the story.To close my review, I leave you with one of the last and most beautiful words said by Stark that I can relate to so well.\"Fuck me, I'm a rock star and all I wanted was a burrito.\" Amen, Stark, amen."}, {"userName": "Steve", "userReviewDate": "Mar 30, 2015", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/2314568-steve", "userReview": "3 stars, but could have been so much more.Okay, so this was a mash-up of urban fantasy, LA-style noir, gothic punk, with angelic/demonic tendencies, along with the potential to be a great story that didn't quite get there.As a 19-year old young man, James Stark was part of a gang heavily involved in magic -- real magic, the kind that can get you killed and sent to Hell. Which is exactly what happened to Stark. Sent to hell for 11 years, where he was used by his demonic tormentors in a gladiator-like arena. He has now escaped, and made his way back to LA for revenge against his former gang.That's the set up, and like I said, the potential is great. I'm not sure what happened along the way, but it failed to live up to that potential. The characters were okay, maybe flat and cliche, the plot was good, if a bit overused, and the \"surprise\" ending was anything but surprising, being broadcast loud and clear from about the halfway point.Even still, I'll keep reading/listening to the series for now, in hopes that it will improve."}, {"userName": "Mogsy (MMOGC)", "userReviewDate": "Dec 30, 2012", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/4379514-mogsy-mmogc", "userReview": "Whoa, this was dark. And also fun. It's got that whole \"I don't give a fuck\" attitude emanating off of it in droves, and you know what? I actually kinda liked that. I've read more urban fantasy in the recent months than I have in years. I like the genre; I admit it's grown on me. But sometimes, I just need an urban fantasy fix that doesn't involve any messy paranormal romances with werewolves, vampires, or faeries, you know what I mean? Sandman Slim was the perfect break from that, with its gritty story about demons and fallen angels and a main character who, like in most urban fantasy books starring a male protagonist, is hilarious and always armed with a treasure trove of pop culture references and creative metaphors. Stark is also so angsty and full of rage that I'm actually kind of worried if I'd be able to take it if he remains this curmudgeon-y for the rest of the series. I am still picking up the next book though, no doubt about it."}, {"userName": "Brian", "userReviewDate": "Aug 21, 2009", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/1936448-brian", "userReview": "Profane, violent, sarcastic, hilarious.

The difference here is Richard Kadrey's writing. His prose is faster than a bullet and as vulgar as a sailor pounding the back door out of a two dollar lady of the night. If that last sentence offended you, please stay away from Sandman Slim. The main character's first-person narration is far more blue. If you like crass descriptions and foul-mouth anecdotes, Sandman Slim is stuffed full of hilarity and offensive charm.Another reason I should have hated this book is the present tense storytelling, but once again, Richard pulled it off. I normally put down a book as soon as I see the first \"is\" instead of \"was,\" because I don't feel present tense is believable. I mean, how is the story being related? The only present tense stuff I can stand is normally short fiction and blog posts. I constantly wonder whether or not the narrator has a voice recorder in his pocket. If your doing this right now, how the hell are you writing it. I know, I know, I'm being to damn literal, but that's how I feel. I have no idea why I was able to withstand the tense of this book and not others. I just did. I loved the fact that the main character, James Stark, (aka Sandman Slim) doesn't care about anything else aside from his own revenge. The world is going to end, and the only reason he's saves it is because the person bringing about hell on earth is the guy who killed his girlfriend. It's a very human story surrounded by magic and supernatural evils. Not to mention, one fun ride. For those of you that care about typos and grammatical foibles, I will say that the book is full of words left in after editing, missing words and several instances where \"bought\" is used instead of \"brought.\" I could almost see someone using the find function in word and accidentally replacing every instance with the wrong word. Oh, and for the ebook version, there are several formatting issues. Mostly with the dialogue. One person will talk and the quotation marks will close out the speech, but then another piece of dialogue, from a completely different person, will start up without a new paragraph. Nobody's perfect, not even the Big Six guys. But most of you already know that. The only reason I even mention it is because I know some of you will care enough to stop reading, which, in my opinion, would be a grand mistake, indeed.I will definitely be checking out the rest of the Sandman Slim series.E."}, {"userName": "Anne", "userReviewDate": "Dec 22, 2010", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/1720620-anne", "userReview": "Remember that movie The Crow, with Brandon Lee? Ok. Sandman Slim has that same vibe...minus the emo goth-boy hero and scruffy little girl with a skateboard.James Stark is the pulp fiction style anti-hero of this story, who has literally been to Hell and back. Eleven years after being betrayed by a group of magicians, whose leader used Stark as the sacrifice to catapult himself to incredible power, he escapes from Hell with a new name and a new reputation. Sandman Slim, the monster who kills monsters. As the only living human in Hell, he was quite a novelty, and not in a good way. And now that he's back, it's time for a little payback. This book isn't for everyone, but if you enjoy dark and dirty, you'll like this. It's not a perfect book, and there were a few times I found myself thinking, why'd he do that, when he could have done this?, or WTF is up with all of his names.

His \u201cfriends\u201d managed to get him pulled into Hell and he's spent the last 11 years entertaining Lucifer and Beelzebub in the gladiatorial arena, learning plenty of new skills (including how to speak High Hellion, which sounds a lot like barking), and acquiring a couple of useful magical objects. Now he's crawled out of the abyss and he's ready for revenge on those who killed his girlfriend and sent him Downtown. Fortunately he's got a little help from a 200 year old French alchemist who's looking for a cure for his immortality and an L.A. Goth girl who runs a video store.Sandman Slim is a well-written and entertaining novel. What I liked best was Richard Kadrey's use of colorful metaphors and similes:* \"Aelita isn't what I imagined an angel would look like. She's about as ethereal as a zip gun. She walks like she's about to call in an air strike or buy Europe. Donald Trump in drag with her enemies' balls in a candy dish on her desk, right next to the stapler.\"* \"Wells motions me over, squinting at me like a constipated Clint Eastwood.\"* \"With a superhuman effort I try to push myself to my feet, but only get myself as far as propping myself on my elbows like a white-trash Sphinx.\"* Stark manages to ruin every piece of clothing he puts on: \"I'm the Joseph Stalin of laundry.\"Sandman Slim is written in a present-tense first person voice and I enjoyed hearing James Stark's thoughts and, especially, his occasional Rules of Thumb:\"One rule of thumb in fighting is that crazy can often overcome skill and numbers, because, while a trained fighter might actually enjoy going up against another trained fighter, no one really wants to wrestle with crazy. Crazy doesn't know when it's winning. And crazy doesn't know when to stop. If you can't pull off crazy, if, for instance, you're handcuffed in a small van with six armed assailants, stupid is a decent substitute for crazy.\"Sandman Slim was also informative. I've learned plenty of things that may be useful some day, like how to saw off a shotgun and how to use duct tape and cinder blocks to make a dead body sink. Also, in case I ever need to threaten to torture someone, I've got plenty of ideas \u2014 some of which involve the transposition of small round body parts.There were some minor issues with the writing \u2014 a couple of mistakes (Kasabian drops the bat but then he's still holding the bat, Stark tells Candy to meet him somewhere and wonders why she doesn't show up in a different place, etc.). I read an advanced review copy, so I hope the editor catches these things (and the typos) before the final version comes out.I really enjoyed Richard Kadrey's style, but I have to say that I didn't really enjoy the story of Sandman Slim. That's not really Mr. Kadrey's issue \u2014 it's me. Mostly the problem is that I'm not much of a fan of the urban bad-ass hero who's waging his own personal vendetta. I tried this novel, hoping it might change my mind, but it didn't \u2014 I just found it to be ugly, coarse, and lacking in beauty (except for those wonderful metaphors). Secondly, I'm a Christian and while I don't mind reading about people crawling out of Hell, I do have some sensitivities. For example, I feel uncomfortable with the premise that \"God f'd up\" which was sort of the theme of Sandman Slim.I have no doubt that there will be many readers who will enjoy Sandman Slim a lot more than I did. I also have no doubt that I'd like to read other works by Richard Kadrey \u2014 something without the personal vendetta and God-f'd-up themes.Richard Kadrey at Fantasy Literature."}, {"userName": "Barbara (VampAngel)", "userReviewDate": "Dec 12, 2010", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/3902029-barbara-vampangel", "userReview": "I'm not sure if I should be giving it 3 or 4 stars. I did enjoy the book a lot, but I have a feeling it is the weakest one in the series, as most first books are. This book is straight up Urban Fantasy, not a drop of Paranormal Romance in there. This doesn't bug me at all, as I'm as much of a fan of UF as I am of PNR. I've been reading a lot of PNR lately which mostly consists of female main characters kicking ass, although I quite enjoy that I was pleased to read a book with a male main character as the narrator. I quite liked Stark. He is an anti-hero, but a kick ass one at that. The book reminds me of The Dresden Files, but Stark is no Harry Dresden. They might share some snark, sarcasm, wit and balls of steel, but Harry is a hero in the best sense of the word. Stark not so much, although I still liked him. The world building is good and solid, gritty and edgy. Heaven and Hell play huge parts in it, and I loved Kadrey's take on it. I even enjoyed meeting Lucifer. I'll be reading the sequel for sure, but I might wait until tomorrow to start it. I think I had all the darkness I can handle for one night. I'd recommend this book to anyone who likes UF and it's not put out by the lack of romance. It might take a little getting used to for people who only read books with female narrators (or maybe not), but it's a book worth reading. Dresden fans will enjoy for sure. I still like Dresden better, but I don't think anyone can take Harry Dresden's number one spot in my heart, so that's not a fair fight."}, {"userName": "Ms. Nikki", "userReviewDate": "Jul 31, 2012", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/3291712-ms-nikki", "userReview": "The Sandman was the most unintelligent anti-hero ever.

Sandman slim could live with that, however wrought with guilt for not being able to protect his only love he's intent on tracking down the man responsible for her death, Mason the plots mastermind and talented magician. This book made for an exceptional quick read. Filled to the rim with action packed laughs along the way. I loved Kadrey's voice throughout the tale. He speaks to an average audience. Although clever there's nothing fancy about his delivery. Perfect style for this type of story.I love Sandman slim's introspection. It didn't give me too much to think about , but did it ever give me a great sense for what kind of character he truly is. What's to likeSandman's arsenal was off the chain. He has Old west dusters, sawed off shotguns, Some Hellion specialties Azazeal's Blade which doubles as a key that can unlock virtually anything, and my personal fave A Na'at \"Traditionally you use a na'at like a spear or a staff, but there's another trigger that collapse the central shaft. Suddenly the na'at is as loose as chicken chow mein, a metal whip that can strip the skin off a rhino like peeling a grape. Not that I've ever peeled a rhino or a grape, but you get the idea.\" Combine some cool weapons with handy earth magic, and Hellion Hexes and you've got a magician killing machine. Sandman slim's favorite pass times- Grand theft auto, he Jacks at least 2-3 vehicles daily.- Watching movies most people haven't heard of.- Smoking, drinking jack Daniels, And making out with mega babe monster chicks that on occasion drink people.Needless to say Kadrey had a lot of fun creating the sandman slim character. And this translated throughout the entire story to me the reader. Final thoughtsLet it be known I love the crazed vigilante Frank Castle. I figure if the Punisher went to hell and came back we'd be looking at Sandman slim. I feel Kadrey payed homage to the genre. and I wouldn't be the least bit surprised to learn that Kadrey was inspired by some great graphic novels like Neil Gaiman's SandmanThe Sandman, Vol. 1: Preludes and Nocturnes, well duh it's just the hell aspect was structured with many similarities. Also Hellblazer Hellblazer: Original Sins James Stark's back story totally reminded me of John Constantine.I would recommend this book for anyone who likes action quick paced (people that play video games) anyone that's dabbled in 90's era graphic novels.

So, on the one hand... I really kind of liked Stark, who was - most of the time - an 'anti-hero' with enough basic decency to carry sympathy for some of the things he did, which weren't -- gentle remonstrances of those with whom he had grievances. Actually, it was kind of creatively nasty sometimes, and there was a lot of humour for a book about someone escaped from Hell to create some hell of his own. On the other hand... I get really quite anxious when the protagonist is told that there's a strong possibility the world is going to end (literally), and it's his fault. At least when nothing could have told him that taking a seemingly sensible - like you'd be brain-dead NOT to if you could - action was somewhere down the line going to end the world. It's worse because the person who makes the accusation should be 'good', and worse again because Stark just wants to save his friends and let the others get on with saving all of humanity, and ... yeah, just anxious. And then there's the God stuff. I'd suggest looking away now if you are going to be offended by language - though seriously, avoid this book if so. I might have a small bit of detail wrong here, but the important bit is that the creation of humans is acknowledged by angels fallen *and* unfallen to have been a major fuck-up by God because He got too distracted playing with cosmic stuff to notice He'd made earth and all. I've no problem reading books with a god, heaven, hell and a (what's the collective noun for angels, I wonder?) bunch of angels that are different enough to treat as fantasy religion, but this gave me pause. It might well be addressed later in the books, but I don't quite get what makes such a big kid God. And back to the first hand .. Stark uses 'best first date ever' in the best way ever, and for that alone I was happy to have read this. I'm not planning to read on at the moment, but that could change as I see GR friends loving later books in the series..."}], "description": "Supernatural fantasy has a new antihero in Sandman Slim, star of this gripping, gritty new series by Richard Kadrey.Life sucks and then you die.
