It's free so why not?I didn\u2019t mean to read this all in one day, but I had to stay up to finish it. Normally, I\u2019m able to put even exciting books down and go to sleep, but this one kept me awake and wanting more.I would say this is a four-star book, but the author deserves a bonus for doing such a good job on his first book. It was well-written and edited. The characters were believable and the story was exciting. I agree that the book should have been longer. A little more plot development and hardship along the way would have made this a definite five-star. I will be sure to read the sequel. If you\u2019re thinking of reading this, please do. The author deserves some recognition and encouragement to continue what he\u2019s doing.Added March 1, 2014:The second book in the series is a definite 5-star. I really liked it. Check it out if you liked this.Remember to support independent writers by writing a review!

This is a smart zombie book. Not about smart zombies, but a story told from the point of view of an older medical doctor who discovers the new disease, a strange combination of leprosy and rabies that causes a homicidal rage in the infected. As society collapses, safe enclaves are created behind walled cities that obsess over cleanliness as a safeguard against infection. The story is well told, the pacing is swift, and the ending unexpected.

But we never get told how patient zero ends up with both diseases or why every country in the world reported this strange medical issue at the same time. How did they become zombies? How exactly does the lack of hygiene begin mini outbreaks? How does not cleaning your clothes or house turn you into a zombie? None of this is addressed in the section of the book I read. Instead it is one long description of the events over the last ten years from the start of the zombie virus until present day, where survivors are living in walled cities and hygiene obsession is your protection against infection. We have this doctor telling us about the first patient he had, the outbreak, the government building walls around cities, the strict hygiene rules, the lack of personal possessions, the grim life where you trust nobody and keep your head down. There is a lot of description about what life is like behind the walls and how people disappear if they don't follow hygiene rules. There was a lot of the doctor thinking about a rumoured place called Oasis where people lived free, the way things were before the zombies. The doctor thinks about it and thinks about his friend talking to him about it but doesn't know if it exists or where it is or what it would be like there. There are a ton of stats about population and infection and zombie numbers and I felt there was too much of this. There is so little dialogue in the book and when you do get a few lines, it feels forced, unrealistic and not very interesting. It's all about wondering where Oasis is or thinking about how grim life is, all things that have been described constantly already. There is so much detail about everything, but no time is spent really developing the characters. The doctor tells you about his new friend but we don't really connect with her because it is all tell and no show. And where are the zombies anyway? This was very heavy going and I got bogged down by it. Not for me."}, {"userName": "Krisaundra", "userReviewDate": "Apr 13, 2014", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/3956934-krisaundra", "userReview": "I just finished reading \"The Oasis of Filth\" and I thoroughly enjoyed it! It was quite different from the majority of novels in the zombie genre, but in those differences were some truly great decisions by the author in creating a post apocalyptic environment, and mind set, that is unlike any other I have ever read, and I have read literally over a hundred books by now dealing with post apocalyptic worlds. From the concept that was developed on how the virus is thought to be spread, to how those potentially infected are dealt with, each of these ideas were completely unique ideas that I thought showed a great deal of creativity. The main characters were engaging, and the overall plot was one I enjoyed from the first page to the last... I really enjoyed all of the things that made this tale different from any other I have read to date. I would not only recommend this book to anyone who enjoys post apocalyptic stories, but even more so to those interested in a different view of how the end of the world just might turn out compared to the usual options we have come to expect in zombie novels! I will be keeping a watchful eye out for any future works by this talented new author!"}, {"userName": "Bill Setzer", "userReviewDate": "Aug 27, 2013", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/23444938-bill-setzer", "userReview": "This book has all the trappings one expects to find in a zombie story... Mysterious disease of unknown origin? Check. Infected individuals thirsting for human flesh? Check. Survivors fighting to live in a post-apocalyptic world?

Humans can apparently survive with this disease for a while living in an enraged state, and referred to as zombies (but they're not dead, so I don't get the \"zombie\" term). The narrator was a doctor prior to the world collapsing, and now lives in the walled city of Washington DC - cities exist pretty much on their own now, and the main rule is cleanliness above all else, otherwise you might catch the disease and become a \"zombie\". He meets a young woman named Rosa who has heard of a place called the Oasis, where people live free of walls. They escaped DC, I cant' remember what exactly Rosa was arrested for, but she escapes and the two of them travel the country to find the Oasis, find it, figure out a cure for the disease, escape the Oasis when it falls due to idiots overwhelming it when Atlanta falls and then try to bring the cure to DC where Rosa is shot outside the walls.

Not because I wanted the characters to live or that I wanted to continue reading. No, I want it to be longer because it needs to be longer.In the first third of the book, the author does an outstanding job of creating a voice and tone that I just love. It's interesting and it weaves a beautiful thread through the canvas required to sustain the story. I can instantly attach to your protagonist. He then introduces Rosa and I understand her as a person, albeit not quite as much as I did the doctor. However, she continues to expand as the story unfolds during the middle third. The way the early chapters end is also just divine. Hanging on with suspense! Gets me to keep reading just one more chapter... And one more... Ok, one more.But somewhere in the middle, the story starts to speed up and much of that beautiful character development gets dropped in favor of focusing very precisely on less important details like directions, landmarks, specific roads, and whatnot. The characters begin to flatten and suddenly I forgot why I cared about them to begin with. Once they get to the Oasis, the book becomes too matter-of-fact, too clinical, too full of minutiae, and again, I want to understand the people who have lived there more than I'm allowed to. The chapters seem to end at points that aren't leaving me hanging on like they did in the first part and I can't quite understand what is happening to my protagonists. The zombie scenes are a flash of blurry activity that I can't picture in my head and then suddenly. It. All. Just. Ends.So to bring it back and not be a book basher, because I am incredibly impressed at the first published book, the author's ability to create characters as evidenced by the first few chapters is his strong suit, particularly in voice/tone. I think if he can continue that style from the beginning all the way through in the next work (because there should be a next work) and the author can add more dimension to the \"action\" scenes, he will nail it. I compare my feelings on the first part of this novel to why I love Stephen King's early work-his character development woven into brilliant storytelling is marvelous. Many of his books were long but that allowed the reader to full connect to the situation and the ones struggling to deal with it. The author started to do this and I was reading with my jaw dropping the further I got into it. I thought \"holy ---- this is GOOD\" and then it dropped off. And I wanted what I had in the beginning and unfortunately, that was gone.In short, bravo. I am amazed at the author's early chops, specifically with regard to the mental imagery of the main characters and the stylistic ease with which he presents them. Keith Soares has quite a skill there and I'm sure he will continue to hone it."}, {"userName": "Jeff Jellets", "userReviewDate": "Nov 22, 2015", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/15694222-jeff-jellets", "userReview": "\u201cStay clean. Stay alive.\u201d It was our mantra.Mixing a dose of leprosy with a dash of the rabies pox brings about the ubiquitous zombie apocalypse in Keith Soares The Oasis of Filth, where the last remnants of disease-free humanity seek shelter in walled, Orwellian city-states. With no way to counter the viral outbreak, filth is tantamount to infection, and humanity\u2019s last hope lies in rumors of a hidden colony where individual freedom -- and maybe even a cure for the plague -- exist.The story is entertaining enough, though there\u2019s also not a lot that you wouldn\u2019t expect from your average \u2018zombie\u2019 survival story. On the plus side, Soares provides a digestible origin to his zombie epidemic, creates a suitably sinister, dystopian society within the claustrophobic walls of Washington, DC, and keeps the plot chugging along rather briskly through a first person narrator \u2013 who is refreshingly sexagenarian. However, once outside the walls of Washington, DC, its pretty much plot standard for the genre -- zombie survivalist groups, search-for-cure, right down to the proverbial RV for conveyance. Not bad and not at all poorly told, just not all that original. More prickly is the book\u2019s timeline; ten years have supposedly passed since the plague outbreak, but the world-beyond-the-walls seems \u2018in a bit too good of shape\u2019 for that much time to have elapsed \u2013 not to mention that most of Soares\u2019 zombies (who are decidedly non-supernatural) should have starved to death (or shredded one another to pieces) in a full decade.Ah well \u2026 putting aside the quibbles \u2026 The Oasis of Filth easily kept me entertained on long flight from Las Vegas to Atlanta.

I passed on reading it many times, because the title turned me off. OK, I should have read this much earlier.This is the first publishing effort by this author, but you wouldn't know it. The book was well put together, appeared to be well edited and used approriate words spelled correctly.This starts out as if it was going to be a typical zombie book, but it's not. After the intro to the story, we learn that the triggering mechanism for the Zombie behaviour is that it is a disease that combines leperocy and rabies.A number of years later, we find the now 60 something doctor who opened the story. He has made a friend of a quiet woman (Rosa) half his age who works as one of the government researchers trying to find a cure for the disease.The story of how a cure for the disease is discovered and then the discovery of the ability to use eggs as a storage facility is interesting.

Those living 'safely' inside cities aren't really living - just working and getting by on the basics. One doctor is drivin to find more of life and a cure for the disease.The doctor teams with an equally inquisitive partner and leaves the confines of the city in search of answers.

Thank you, Keith Soares, for writing such a classic, tense outbreak plotline! The story is fast paced and absorbing from the get-go, with just enough scientific explanation to suggest plausibility. Bear in mind that this story focuses on the post-outbreak world instead of the initial discovery. It's an interesting, realistic take on the possible warping of human society after a devastating event; showing how humanity's natural protective instincts can have an unintended side effect of cultural stasis. The violence and the exciting fight-or-flight segments are well-balanced with the more reflective and character-developing passages.
