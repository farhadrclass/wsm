For my money, there are three of Austen's six finished novels that one can make a good argument for being her \"best\": \"Pride and Prejudice\" (the popular choice, and my wife's) \"Emma\" (the educated choice--most lit profs go with this one) \"Persuasion\" (the truly refined choice) Harrold Bloom in \"The Western Canon\" calls it perhaps a \"perfect novel,\" and while I disagree with some of his interpretations of the characters (yes, blasphemy, I know), I wholeheartedly concur with his overal assessment. While all of Austen's novels are generally comic, \"Persuasion\" is the most nuanced. It's been described as \"autumnal\" and that word suits it. There's a bittersweetness to it that you just don't get in Austen's other work. The novel it comes closest to in terms of character and plot is probably one of her earliest novels \"Sense and Sensibility.\" Like Eleanor in that novel, Anne is older and more mature than the typical Austen heroine. In fact, she's dangerously close to being \"over the hill\" at the age of 27(!). Love has passed her by, apparently. But unlike Eleanor, who one always feels will muddle through even if she ends up disappointed in affairs of the heart, there's something more dramatically at stake with Anne. She is in great danger of ceasing to exist, not physically, but socially. When we meet her, she's barely there at all. Although a woman of strong feelings, she is ignored and literally overlooked by most of the other characters. In the universe of Austen's novels, the individual doesn't truly exist unless connected with the social world, and while Anne has a stoic strength, we understand that she is in some senses doomed if things don't change for her. This is where we see what the mature Austen can do with a character type that she couldn't when she was younger. This edition also has the original ending of the novel included as an appendix, which gives us a rare and fascinating look in to Austen as a technical artist. I read this novel as an undergraduate, and have reread it several times since. I even took the novel with me to Bath on a trip to England, and spent a wonderful summer evening reading it while sitting in Sidney Gardens, across the street from one of the homes Austen lived in during her time in Bath, listening to Mozart's Piano Concerto #27. It's one of my favorite memories. More than any other of her novels, \"Persuasion\" shows how Austen dealt with profound existential questions within the confines of her deceptively limited setting and cast of characters. Those who think Austen is simply a highbrow precursor to contemporary romance novels or social comedies are missing the colossal depth of thought that is beneath the surface of any of her novels, this one most of all. Austen is nearly unique in the history of the novel for the consistency of her excellence. While most novelists have a clear masterpiece that stands out among their work, and usually a fairly sizable number of works that are adequate but not enduring, all of Austen's novels stand up to repeated readings and deserve a wide audience among today's readers. Having said that, \"Persuasion\" is simply the best of the best."}, {"userName": "Zo\u00eb", "userReviewDate": "Oct 30, 2016", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/9303625-zo", "userReview": "Jane Austen never disappoints me! This was the first time I've read this book, and, since it's one of her less popular novels, I didn't know what to expect. However, I quickly was swept up into the story and felt all of Anne's emotions like they were my own. I really enjoyed how, unlike the other Austen novels I've read, this one focuses on love lost and how, over time, people change in some ways but remain the same in other ways. Anne and Captain Wentworth aren't my favorite Austen characters, but I still very much enjoyed how they were forced to face many obstacles, reflect, and mature before getting their happily ever after. My only complaint is that I wish we got to know more about Captain Wentworth, so I could feel the love for him as strongly as Anne does."}, {"userName": "Kat \u2620", "userReviewDate": "Jul 14, 2014", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/18457521-kat", "userReview": "I want to share something with you. It's a long story and while it might initially seem irrelevant to this book, I assure you there is a point to it.Are you sitting comfortably? Then I shall begin.During the summer of 2008 my bestie and I were preparing to go to university. When it was time to move into our halls we had to hire (read: my dad did) a rental van to take our stuff - on account of my friend being entirely impractical and insisting on taking all of her shit. So, on the weekend of said move, my friend's older brother agreed to meet us there and help get us settled in.After a 5 hour drive (it should've taken half that time but the sat nav lady was a bitch and fucked us over) we arrived. I got out of the van and spotted my friend's brother. I halted momentarily in my haste to rush over and say hello when I caught sight of the man he was talking to. Talking to my friend's brother was quite possibly the most beautiful man I had ever seen. He was much taller than me, lean muscled, with hair that refused to behave and rebelled against product by continuously flopping right onto his forehead despite his many frustrated attempts to brush his hair back with his hand. To complete this look he was wearing the sexiest pair of geek glasses you could ever wish to see. I was an instantly smitten kitten.When I finally reached them the beautiful stranger turned his face in my direction. I'm pretty sure I had a mini orgasm when he did this because my beautiful stranger had the most ridiculous green eyes and a motherfucking chin dimple (drooling may also have happened upon this discovery).While I was staring at my beautiful stranger, my friend's brother decides to make introductions. . .\"Hey, Kat. This is my friend James. James this is--\"\"What the fuck happened to you?\" James saidI stood there stunned for all of 0.5 seconds that this beautiful man would speak to me that way especially when he didn't know me. Then I immediately went into full-on self defence mode. In the fairness of full disclosure I should say I did look a fright as I was suffering with severe sunburn after getting drunk and falling asleep in the sunshine (don't try that at home kids). My skin had blistered all along my left arm and was oozing pus and it really was gross. But I had my pride and my pride took over and I said, \"Hey! Don't be rude. For all you know I could have some deadly disease!\" \"Well, do you?\" \"Er, no. It's severe sunburn but that's not the point, fucker, and you know it!\" He responded by dazzling me with the most irritatingly gorgeous smile as though my outburst was amusing. My response was to gift him with my thousand yard stare which he didn't seem to appreciate. I have no idea why. By now an intense stare down had commenced between myself and James, the man who was originally my beautiful stranger. I did a little victory jig when he looked away first and then went about the business of moving in, all the while internally warring with myself about how I could find such a fucking fucker so attractive.That was the first time I met James.We saw each other intermittently during the following year (we attended different universities). Always verbally sparring. Outwardly I acted as though he was a pain in the arse. Inwardly I secretly loved those moments we shared.For our second year at university my friend and I left the halls and moved into a house with 2 other people. Without realising it at the time this was going to be the beginning of things changing between James and I. It was in my new dwellings I discovered Call of Duty. One of my flatmates had a PlayStation and introduced me to the wonder that is COD. I spent many hours playing this. Honing my skills. Knowing that one day it would be useful. And I was right.Somehow James found out about my new favourite thing and we began playing against each other online. It was here my COD mad skillz were made known.They were made known by my uncanny ability to kill James with a head shot nearly every. single. time. Weirdly this kept making him mad which amused me no end. In order for him to complain at the injustice of it all we began to speak on the phone. This was the start of us becoming best friends.The following three years were spent playing COD regularly, seeing each other when possible but still speaking every day. I learned all his secrets and he learned mine.In 2012 when I graduated university I moved back to London. It was always my intention to do it but I had the added motivation of that's where James was. And for the first time in the four years we'd known each other I was finally going to get to be in the same city as a man who'd come to be my best friend.For the most part I was in heaven with this. But I was internally warring with myself again when the realisation struck me that my feelings were beginning to change. Not willing to risk our friendship I said nothing. Not for once believing that this amazing man could ever feel the same about me.Every time he went out on dates with other women I swear a little bit of me died. I tried going on dates myself but they were always unmitigated disasters due to the fact my heart had already made up its mind and decided it wanted James. December 2012. Two weeks before Christmas and I was sick with flu. For the first time in four days I managed to leave my bed but made it no further than my sofa. James had declared himself my chief nurse during this time. Staying with me, taking care of me, and, knowing how much it mattered to me, making sure my cats were also taken care of. When he wasn't reading to me we were bingeing on box sets of The Wire. During an early episode of the the third series I started feeling a sense of foreboding that something bad was going to happen to my beloved Stringer Bell. I'd barely been able to speak for days but I managed to say, rather croakily, \"If David Simon kills off Stringer I promise you I will take up ninja fighting, fly to Baltimore, and use my new found ninja skills on him before threatening to do the same to his family members if he ever kills off my most favourite character, Omar, or Brother Mouzone.\" James started chuckling which I wasn't happy about because I was deadly serious. I continued watching The Wire all the while muttering to myself my revenge plans when James said with a smile in his voice, \"You're terrible.\" I still continued my watching but stopped my muttering to say jokingly, \"I know I am but you still love me.\" And then, in a voice I'd never ever heard him use before, \"Yeah. . . I do.\" There was something in that tone that caused me to drag my eyes away from the tv. And when I did, that's when I saw he wasn't joking.Because that look on his face. That fucking look. It said everything. I responded in the only way I knew how. With a very loud, despite my sore throat, \"WHAT THE EVER LOVING FUCK?!?!\"I was rewarded with the most beautiful smile and I knew we were going to be just fine.I later learned his initial reaction to me was that of shock at seeing me in the flesh that day, as he had no clue I would be there. Apparently, a few months before, he had seen a picture of me and told me that looking at it made him feel funny things. The good kind.That's the story of how James and I came to be.Okay, so I bet you're wondering what that has to do with anything. Let me tell you. I've always thought Persuasion was Jane Austen's most romantic novel. A large part of that is to do with this letter that Captain Wentworth writes to Anne:\nI can listen no longer in silence. I must speak to you by such means as are within my reach. You pierce my soul. I am half agony, half hope. Tell me not that I am too late, that such precious feelings are gone for ever. I offer myself to you again with a heart even more your own than when you almost broke it, eight years and a half ago. Dare not say that man forgets sooner than woman, that his love has an earlier death. I have loved none but you. Unjust I may have been, weak and resentful I have been, but never inconstant. You alone have brought me to Bath. For you alone, I think and plan. Have you not seen this? Can you fail to have understood my wishes? I had not waited even these ten days, could I have read your feelings, as I think you must have penetrated mine. I can hardly write. I am every instant hearing something which overpowers me. You sink your voice, but I can distinguish the tones of that voice when they would be lost on others. Too good, too excellent creature! You do us justice, indeed. You do believe that there is true attachment and constancy among men. Believe it to be most fervent, most undeviating, inF. W.I must go, uncertain of my fate; but I shall return hither, or follow your party, as soon as possible. A word, a look, will be enough to decide whether I enter your father's house this evening or never.\nAnd this line after Anne reads it:\nSuch a letter was not soon to be recovered from.\nThis letter was such a simple gesture. It cost nothing. Yet Anne could be in no doubt about anything.Much like that look James gave me that day. And to this day that look is the greatest thing he has ever given me, and bar any future children, always will be.So now I hope you understand why I told you this story.Persuasion is my favourite romance, my favourite second chance romance and my favourite Austen."}, {"userName": "Bookdragon Sean ", "userReviewDate": "Feb 02, 2016", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/27788046-bookdragon-sean", "userReview": "Jane Austen is ruthless and brilliant; she is sarcastic, subtle and superbly witty. She writes in such a matter of fact way that the absurdity of her characters is in plain sight. Sir Walter Elliot is a complete fool. Austen doesn\u2019t need to tell her reader this, she shows it to them. The man is completely bankrupt, but he completely refuses to cut down on his ridiculously high expenditure or sell of any of his lands. He is so obsessed with his outer image that he risks all to keep it in a state of, what he perceives as, perfection. Then there is the way he perceives his daughters. Elizabeth is vain and stupid like her farther, but, to him, she is wonderful. She adheres to the strict code of womanly/daughterly custom; she is also a self-absorbed flatterer; thus, her pig headed farther loves her dearly. The protagonist Anne, on the other hand, is intelligent, kind and occasionally speaks her mind; thus, her father and sister view her as furniture. She is \u201conly Anne.\u201d There is no affection for the younger sister because she isn\u2019t so fixated upon her outer image. She is pushed aside and rarely listened to. At the start of the novel, this is so much so, that it doesn\u2019t even feel like she is present. The initially quiet heroine is overshadowed by her overbearing farther and the ridiculous nature of society. And now, with Austen at my back, I\u2019m going to slate Sir Walter to death. Let\u2019s start with the opening of the book. Just look at the mastery of the tone:\u201cSIR WALTER ELLIOT, of Kellynch-hall, in Somerset- shire, was a man who, for his own amusement, never took up any book but the Baronetage; there he found occupation for an idle hour, and consolation in a distressed one; there his faculties were roused into admiration and respect, by contemplating the limited remnant of the earliest patents; there any unwelcome sensations, arising from domestic affairs, changed naturally into pity and contempt. As he turned over the almost endless creations of the last century\u2014and there, if every other leaf were powerless, he could read his own history with an interest which never failed\u2014this was the page at which the favourite volume always opened: \u201cELLIOT OF KELLYNCH-HALL.\u201dThis symbolises is high self-regard along with his obsession with his personal status; it is all that is important to him: it is all he wants to read about. As a result, he spends hours reading and editing the entries, and turns to it when in need of comfort. Traditionally, the book that would be taken in an individual\u2019s time of need would be the Bible. This demonstrates that to Sir Walter, his status is the most important aspect of his life; it\u2019s all he truly cares about. There is also a degree of significance in the fact that all the edits Sir Walter makes are past instances, there are no new entries to signify the recent decrease in monetary fortune. The book, and him, both belong in the past; he is constantly looking back at his family\u2019s foundations, but doing very little, prior to Lady Russel\u2019s intervention, to actually improve their current situation. This is both comic and contemptible because when his estate is falling into ruin, he only cares about its outward appearance making him a caricature of the old class; it, suggests that they, perhaps, need to go or at the very least change.This is where the new, more attractive, navel gentlemen come in. The idea of what constituted gentlemen was becoming more flexible during the Romantic era and nineteenth century. Previously, the higher societies predominantly consisted of those who received their status at birth: the landed gentry. The idea of what makes a gentleman was moving forward with the changing opportunities afforded by the Napoleonic wars. The war meant that men from common birth like Admiral Croft and Captains Wentworth and Benwick, could climb the social ladder due to fortune and title granted by successful soldering. They\u2019d earnt the money that was associated with a higher place within society. They could enter it with a degree of equality. -Captain WentworthSo, worthy men have an increase in fortune; they\u2019ve earnt their rank. But Sir Walter, as caricature of the old class, opposes this notion vehemently. This can be seen with, you guessed it, is obsession with outer appearance. This time it\u2019s with his physical beauty. He artificially attempts to cling to his youth, which can be seen when he converses with Anne later in the novel. He has a surprisingly large amount of knowledge about skin treatments that defy age. His self-absorbency with his physical appearance is symbolic of his perceived appearance within society. To him, a gentleman is supposed to possess certain outward qualities. He finds the idea of Admiral Croft disturbing, common and ungentlemanly. He remarks that he has only two objections to sailors:\u201cFirst, as being the means of bringing persons of obscure birth into undue distinction, and raising men to honours which their fathers and grandfathers never dreamt of; and secondly, as it cut\u2019s up a man\u2019s youth and vigour most horribly; a sailor grows old sooner than any other man; I have observed it all my life.\u201dAccording to him, this can lead to one becoming an object of disgust such as Admiral Baldwin who is \u201call lines and wrinkles\u201d and \u201crough and rugged to the last degree.\u201d Sir Walter is practically disgusted at this \u201cwretched life\u201d of a sea fairer. Never mind the fact that he has spent his life in service to his, and Sir Walter\u2019s, country, which contrasts with how Sir Walter has spent his whole life in service to himself. Yet, his position in society is higher and more esteemed. The navy is deserves his respect; they helped to facilitate an England that remained under English rule and not one under the thumb of Napoleon Bonaparte.The disapproval of Sir Walter is suggestive of Austen\u2019s approval. She is arguing for the benefits of a system like the navy; it promotes its members based upon merit and due distinction. This is in direct contrast to the old system that Sir Walter reveres. There is a certain degree of irony in the fact that Admiral Croft can afford to live in Sir Walter\u2019s home when Sir Walter cannot. It is a symbolic demotion, one that leaves the self-made man living in deserved splendour. This is where Austen uses free indirect style to suggest that the narrator\u2019s opinions are similar to our protagonist\u2019s. She has a choice between the old breed of gentry, a man resembling her father\u2019s class, or a young romantic naval officer who represents the benefits of an increase in social mobility. It\u2019s obvious which one she chooses. Anne is not a fool. She was persuaded once, but she now sees with clarity and focus. She can see the worth of the two men and knows which one is worth her time.-William Elliot (The young shadow of Sir Walter) From analysing the representation of the contrasting gentlemen, it becomes apparent that Austen gives social mobility positive connotations. Sir Walter Elliot remains in a position of higher social rank, but his so called social inferiors are afforded with gentlemen like qualities, ones that he so clearly lacks. They are admitted to high social circles despite their birth. They possess more honour, sense and purpose than the old class of gentlemen that Sir Walter represents. Therefore, when a man such a Sir Walter, one who is vein and self-obsessed, is resistant to the idea of social mobility, it becomes rather difficult not to be persuaded by the benefits of its progress that Austen evokes.I love Jane Austen\u2019s novels. Admittedly, I\u2019ve only read two, but I can already see the brilliance of the author. Her novels are so subtly clever with hidden suggestions. I really admire what she does. I\u2019m sticking with my rule from here on out though. I attest that each Austen novel needs to be read at least twice, perhaps even thrice, to get the full effect of what she does. I missed so much of it on my initial reading. It\u2019s quite surprising, but sometimes you need to have seen the entire picture before you can judge each individual part. There\u2019s just so much to take from this. I\u2019ve only focused on one angle in my review, though there is so much going on. I\u2019ve actually cut this down a little because it was starting to get far too long for a review. This is an English student\u2019s dream. I need to go and read more Austen novels!

I'm not a huge reader of classics-- a fact i'm working on rectifying-- so when I wasn't very much enjoying the first two chapters, I got nervous. But as soon as I pushed through to the heart of the storyline, I began to crave in-class discussions over this book. I absolutely loved Anne as a main character, and Captain Wentworth was such a fitting companion for her that I was hooked, dying to find out how their lives played out. This book made me feel a lot of things-- especially the feeling that comes with crying at 4 AM about fictional men-- and I'm thoroughly surprised that such an old book still remains touching and relatable. I just wish that Austen implemented more dialogue in her writing, which is why I took off half a star; I feel like sometimes the book was bogged down with too many paragraphs of thought and not enough spoken word.

My first time adding a book to my all-time favorites list in eight MONTHS!Yes, this one usurps Pride & Prejudice. I can hardly believe it. P&P remains in my mind the greatest love story ever told (or, okay, at least the greatest one I\u2019ve ever read). But this one has so much more than a killer romance and a wonderful set of sisters. (I still love you, Bennet ladies.)While I adore P&P, \u201cfunny\u201d isn\u2019t the first adjective that comes to mind. Persuasion had me cracking UP. 19th century eloquence has never been more hilarious. Also, Austen can feel wordy at times, but this little number rarely had that problem. I pretty much flew through it whenever I had the pleasure of picking it up.(This is a mini-update: just realized I never even mentioned the characters in this review. Lol.) On the character front: Anne pretty much rocks. She's a stone cold intellectual sweetheart and she's goals. Wentworth is also a total sweetheart (if a little boring/flat - he will not replace Darcy in my heart). It's usually really goddamn hard to tell Austen characters apart (I feel like 99% of them will have the same first name and there will only be like 3 last names) but pretty much everyone in this had a distinct personality and even manner of speaking, so distinguishing who was who was a lot easier! Also, the characters in this tend to be so flippin' funny it's insane.To everyone who told me this is the best Austen book: you\u2019re so right. I respect you so much, and I\u2019m sorry I laughed at you in my head for thinking this could be better than Pride & Prejudice.

I love Jane Austen, and I love the plot of Persuasion: Two people who loved each other deeply and parted badly, meeting again after eight years apart. Everything seems to combine to prevent their ever being able to come to an understanding again: his bitter feelings, her faded looks (mostly through unhappiness; she's only 28 or 29), other younger girls vying for his attention, which he's only too happy to give them. Austen's intelligence, dry wit and humor are evidenced on every page. The melancholy, autumnal feel of the first part of the book, when all you can see is Anne's blighted hopes and how she is disregarded and mistreated by almost everyone around her, is wrenching. Then, like springtime, comes the slow, gradual return of joy and hope to Anne's life. I loved the energy and achievements of the military characters, as opposed to the stagnant, superficial aristocracy. And mostly: That Letter. *sigh*I do have a few beefs: The actual writing here doesn't seem as nuanced and deep as some of Austen's other works. The characters tend to be a little bit one-dimensional: Anne Elliot is so unfailingly noble and kind and self-sacrificing; her family members are so invariably shallow and hard-hearted and self-centered. I got quite tired of Anne's nerves or whatever getting overwrought and her needing to retire to meditate in solitude to recover her self-possession; it happened All. The. Time. Anyone who thinks Fanny in Mansfield Park is a bit of a stick in the mud needs to take a closer look at Anne. And the last line of the book is still vaguely anticlimactic to me; I keep thinking Jane might have come up with a better ending if she'd had more time to polish the book.Still, there's so much to love in Persuasion, and the good far outweighs the bad for me. And I'm a romantic and a hopeful person at heart, so the persistence of love through the years, and the ability of the characters (with a little luck) to work through injured pride on the one side, and unsupportive family and friends on the other, and find lasting happiness together, warms my heart.

And this comes from someone who is well-accustomed to Austen's often whiny, vain, and hilariously self-deluded characters who serve as comedy gold and tools of subtle social commentary. But somehow in this posthumously published work, I feel she focused her attentions on lathering an extra layer of vindictiveness on to many of the players. Additionally, the first three quarters of the narrative progressed in the most lacklustre manner possible with little to no development on any front. No dramatic confrontations, emotionally charged conversations, simmering sexual tension or witty, flirty banter to spice things up. The overwhelming blandness of it all felt too close to real life situations.But of course, this is Austen. The same woman whose remarkable insight on the condition of women is reflected in a letter to one of her correspondents a hundred years ago. \nSingle women have a dreadful propensity for being poor-which is one very strong argument in favour of Matrimony.\nThe same woman who rescued the English novel from the tenacious grip of the age of sentiment and genre trope hysterics of the gothic novel to give it a truly modern form. The same woman who tried to challenge the laws that governed social interaction of the times by placing as great an emphasis on moral behaviour as on class-based identity. And this very same woman makes Anne Elliot her mouthpiece while arraigning the convention of woman-shaming that contemporary male novelists upheld with gusto and a latent smugness.\nMen have had every advantage of us in telling their own story. Education has been theirs in so much higher a degree; the pen has been in their hands. I will not allow books to prove any thing.\nSo yes my dwindling interest in the book and abrupt loss of faith in Austen's brilliance lasted only for a few disappointing pages before she turned things around quite climactically. At the ripe age of twenty-seven, Anne Elliot maybe one of Austen's least remarkable heroines. Neither does she possess Emma's sass and cool confidence nor does she exude Elizabeth's unwavering self-esteem and channel a sardonic indifference towards her social superiors. And yet she never backs down from defending members of her own sex from unsavory remarks based on hollow prejudices. \nIt is a difference of opinion which does not admit of proof. We each begin probably with a little bias towards our own sex, and upon that bias build every circumstance in favour of it which has ocurred within our circle; many of which circumstances (perhaps those very cases which strike us the most) may be precisely such as cannot be brought forward without betraying a confidence, or in some respect saying what should not be said.\nSo persuasion. The excellence of this book's central premise is that it establishes Anne Elliot as a woman who is consistent in love and errs only on the side of caution even though outwardly she is perceived as a pushover, one who yields easily to persuasion and incitement. Long story short, Austen ingeniously misled both her hero and her reader to the wrong conclusions about the heroine. And she knew how exactly to subvert the power dynamics of hierarchical social structures while simultaneously preserving the veneer of conformity. If that's not genius, I don't know what is."}, {"userName": "Nataliya", "userReviewDate": "May 02, 2010", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/3672777-nataliya", "userReview": "Dear Miss Austen,Ummm... Anne Elliot is past her youth and bloom??? Heh? She is MY AGE! Scratch that - she is \nyounger\n than me. **..........Basically, get off my lawn, kids. I mean it..............In all seriousness, this is the first Jane Austen book that does not feature a pretty and charming teenager looking for a perfect match in a cultured and rich gentleman. Instead, her protagonist Anne Elliot is well into the respectable age of seven-and-twenty, equipped with composure and maturity that only age can bring. (Hey, maybe advanced age is not so bad, after all! But I happily maintain that mentally I'm still eleven. Oh, and as I said, get off my lawn!)Anne finds herself in a quite uncomfortable situation. Years ago, she was engaged to a dashing young sailor whom she subsequently rejected on the well-meaning but ultimately flawed advice of a trusted friend. Now that sailor, having transformed into a respectable and well-to-do, and still dashing Captain Wentworth, reenters Anne's circle of acquaintances, clearly still resenting Anne, and appears to be actively looking for a younger prettier future spouse. All that while Anne, ruined by age (just kidding, she is still quite pretty, as it turns out) realizes she still harbors her old affection for him but needs (of course!) to maintain all the necessary societal proprieties.On top of all of that, Anne has the most rotten family! Her father is a pathetic handsome gentleman unhealthily obsessed with his own good looks (I mean, the man has a bedroom full of mirrors! Puh-lease.) Her younger sister will claw your eyes out if she were to think you'd eclipse her as a center of attention even for a minute (this is a woman who feels slighted if her dying son gets more attention than she does), and will spend hours sending little verbal put-downs in Anne's direction while shamelessly using her help for anything imaginable. And yet, this pathetic creature is still \"not so repulsive and unsisterly as Elizabeth\", the older sister. \"To be claimed as a good, though in an improper style, is at least better than being rejected as no good at all.\"And all of Anne's family members seem to compete with each other in how to best put down Anne - the treatment that she easily sees but tolerates without complaining and in good spirits. Oh, and they have to downsize because all the vain and shallow family members are quite rotten at preserving the family fortune.Basically, to sum up: .Anne Elliot is a well-mannered, reasonable, proper, and sensible heroine. Good thing she is NOT the one narrating this story, or it would have been quite bland. Instead, we are treated to a quite snarky (albeit within strict early-19th-century British sensibilities) narrative voice, picking apart all of our characters and their environment with a lovely and a bit sarcastic commentary. Ah, Miss Austen, you were really getting fed up with your well-mannered society, weren't you? And I love it.I love how delightfully drama-free this story is. No huge events, no shocking twists, nothing except for reasonable behavior and not-too-exciting provincial life (well, in all honesty, excepting two near-fatal falls, at least one of which was getting me all worried about epidural vs. subdural hematoma, which is no joke). The only hint of strong passion is in a short letter from Wentworth to Anne, and even then the declaration of love is done in a subdued epistolary form. And it is precisely this quiet flow of the story that creates an enjoyable atmosphere, strangely............................\"But I hate to hear you talking so like a fine gentleman, and as if women were all fine ladies, instead of rational creatures. We none of us expect to be in smooth water all our days.\"And another thing that I came to appreciate is the attempt to decry the classism of English society. The most admirable people in this book are not the gentlemen by birth, unlike the proverbial Mr. Darcy (ughh) but the naval officers and their circles - Wentworth and the Crofts especially. It's like Austen was finally acknowledging that it's not only the birth into the gentry class that makes you a decent person. Way to go, Miss Austen! Congratulations on succeeding in making all your hypocritical gentlemen with overblown feeling of self-importance appear to be total idiots like they should be: \"A man is in greater danger in the navy of being insulted by the rise of one whose father, his father might have disdained to speak to, and of becoming prematurely an object of disgust himself, than in any other line.\"A lovely 3.5-star book. It does not quite reach the 4-star enjoyment of Jane Eyre, but it is a delightful book with which to spend an overcast day filled with bronchitis cough. \"Anne wondered whether it ever occurred to him now, to question the justness of his own previous opinion as to the universal felicity and advantage of firmness of character; and whether it might not strike him that, like all other qualities of the mind, it should have its proportions and limits. She thought it could scarcely escape him to feel that a persuadable temper might sometimes be as much in favour of happiness as a very resolute character.\""}, {"userName": "Lisa", "userReviewDate": "Feb 04, 2018", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/32532774-lisa", "userReview": "to persuade (verb) \u201cto make someone do or believe something by giving them a good reason to do it or by talking to that person and making them believe it\u201dJane Austen delivers a PERSUASIVE analysis of the concept of PERSUASION, slowly PERSUADING the reader that being of a PERSUADABLE temper, commonly regarded as a virtue in young women of her time, is a weakness and a barrier to personal happiness.Why? The answer is quite simple, and still as valid as two centuries ago: more often than not, the kind, caring and sensitive characters tend to be PERSUADABLE, whereas the egotistical, narcissistic, and stubborn bullies tend to be PERSUASIVE.Anne Elliot, the classical Cinderella in a vain, ambitious and superficial family, sacrifices her love to accommodate the pride and prejudice of those who call themselves her friends and allies. Eight years pass during which she PERSUADES herself that her role is that of a supporting member of the family, patiently attending to the tantrums of her sisters and accepting the disregard of her conceited father.When her former love unexpectedly enters the stage again, they both remain PERSUADED that the other one is lost forever, and play a PERSUASIVE game of dissimulation before finally reaching the PERSUASION that love conquers all - even society\u2019s coercive directives.The lesson learned from this social study is that there is hardly a case in which PERSUASION is unbiased and truly beneficial. The moment a person needs to be convinced to do something against his or her natural inclination, all kinds of complications, sacrifices and frustrations are likely to follow.Listen to yourself before you listen to PERSUASIVE bullies, is my PERSUASION, after reading Jane Austen.I was thus a PERSUADABLE reader."}, {"userName": "Trevor", "userReviewDate": "Jul 09, 2008", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/175635-trevor", "userReview": "What can I possibly tell you about Jane Austen? I really enjoyed this. I really like that by the end you get to move a bit out of the head of the main character, away from her self-deprecations and almost masochistic lacerations and get to see what Captain Wentworth actually did think of her \u2013 rather than her-less-than-self-congratulatory version.Okay, it is all very romantic \u2013 but what I found most interesting in this book was how I felt compelled to consider how much of the world we learn by having it reported to us. There is the life we live and know first hand, well, more or less, and then there is the world that we know from \u2018trusted sources\u2019. And all of this adds to make up the whole of our perspective of \u2018reality\u2019, whatever that might be. There is always a layer of reality below which we can only ever guess at \u2013 and that is what is really going on in the minds of others. Sometimes we do discover something of this \u2013 and that might either bring joy or pain \u2013 but otherwise we construct and reconstruct the world on the best narrative we can make from the frowns or smiles of those around us, glimpsed however imperfectly in the twinkling of a moment.A while ago I took a very dear friend of mine to the local art gallery and showed her a couple of little statue things they have there of two old women. The artist has created these two miniature people \u2013 two homunculi who are engrossed in the conversation they whisper between themselves. If you view them from the front they look to be talking away quite contentedly \u2013 almost conspiratorially - but as you move around to view them from the back you see that one of them looks very anxious, perhaps almost about to cry, perhaps oddly frightened. This fear isn\u2019t something you notice at all from the front. But in life we don\u2019t get to have this 360 degree perspective on the people we meet and talk to \u2013 and so only one of these views is open to us. The guesses we make on the motivations and desires of others are always partial, always mixed up with our own motivations and desires and misattributions.So it is that Anne Elliot spends much of the novel \u2013 perhaps a woman a little too good for this world. She can even watch on with quiet resignation as the man she loves seems to be choosing someone else to marry.There are many interesting themes in this book \u2013 class distinctions and their worth in judging the value of someone, when to take the advice of someone and when not to, how jealousy has much to recommend it in regaining the love of your ex. But one of the things I was most interested in was the theme of \u2018love and property\u2019 which Marx and Engels talk about in the Manifesto. It is a knee jerk reaction now to say we should marry for love \u2013 but in the immortal words of an Irish folk song:\u201cLove is pleasingAnd love is teasingAnd love is a pleasure when first it\u2019s newBut as it grows olderSure the love grows colder\u2018Til it fades away like the morning dew.\u201dThis is a romance, so we don\u2019t get to see this happen to our protagonists, but the relationships of those around them would hardly make one seek to rush into the married state. From the bizarre and almost incestuous relationship between Anne\u2019s father and her older sister, to the marriage of her younger sister, Mary \u2013 and the marriage of Benwick to Louisa is surely destined to crash and burn. Everyone in Anne\u2019s family is unspeakably awful \u2013 when Austen wants to create a character that is a pain in the bum she does so with unerring perception. Mary and her father are masterworks in the description of the obnoxious in human form \u2013 the botched soul.Ms Austen also obviously had a bit of a thing for the \u2018strong, silent types\u2019 (think Mr Darcy without the fairytale quest bit in the middle) \u2013 but there is also something of the Enlightenment about this book. The idea that real feeling, the hope of a truly happy marriage, can only be based on the common rationality of the couple at hand. Love is a mingling of minds, rather than bodies. And this isn\u2019t some sort of nineteenth century prudishness, or at least, not only, but more a hypothesis that is played out in the marriages of the major characters.Love, then, is a version of that highest type of friendship that our old mate Aristotle was so fond of \u2013 and that life cruelly teaches us is so incredibly rare for us with people of either sex. To have both sexual attraction and mental attraction with one single \u2018other person\u2019 is perhaps really asking too much and just being greedy. Still, I guess all would be well if not for those damn hormones. And of everyone in the book poor old Benwick probably cops the worst press - for not being constant enough to the memory of his recently departed ex-wife. The discussion at this point reminded me a bit of Hamlet whinging about his mum and uncle. But this does all end up with that most wonderful of quotes \u2013 where Anne says that women may not love deeper, but that they do love longer, even after all hope is gone. If you are going to get a slap in a piece of classic fiction, it is probably best that it happen in a way that results in such a line. The fact she is almost moved to tears after saying this line and that it is basically the turning point of the entire book really is a lovely thing.If only in life it could be that saying the utterly perfect thing would reap such rich rewards\u2026 But then, I guess that does rather put the onus on finding the utterly perfect thing to say."}, {"userName": "Diane", "userReviewDate": "Aug 14, 2007", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/279256-diane", "userReview": "For the past few years, I've chosen one favorite book to reread during winter break. Last year it was Jane Eyre, the year before it was Emma. This year I decided to spend Christmas with Anne Elliot and Captain Frederick Wentworth. They are wonderful company! Anne is wise and well-spoken, considerate of others, and eager to help wherever she can. Captain Wentworth is a gentleman, thoughtful and courteous. He is conscious of Anne's virtues and her value as a companion, and he hopes to secure her love again.You see, Frederick and Anne first fell in love when she was 19, but he had no money, and her family objected to the match. So Anne was persuaded to refuse him. Eight years later, Frederick has returned to the neighborhood and is now a wealthy naval captain. He is single and is looking for a wife. Anne is also single and still loves him. In truth, she has been waiting for him. But can he forgive her for refusing him all those years ago? They'll have to work through a few obstacles to find out.Since Anne and Frederick are creations of the inimitable Jane Austen, you can be sure that although our hero and heroine have great worth, this novel also features relatives of such vanity and silliness as to make you both wince and laugh in amusement. Anne's father and sisters are ridiculously full of themselves and judge everyone to be beneath them, save perhaps for royalty. One of my favorite scenes in the book is when Anne goes to visit her whiny sister Mary, and everyone in the family takes turns pulling Anne aside to secretly complain about Mary, begging her to do something. Poor Anne, always caught in the middle!I am not sure when I first read Persuasion, but it's likely been a decade since I last opened it, so this reread was a true delight. Austen's insight into her characters, their feelings and motivations, is so profound that I always marvel at how cleverly and artfully she wrote them. Take this first description of Anne's foppish father:Vanity was the beginning and the end of Sir Walter Elliot's character; vanity of person and of situation. He had been remarkably handsome in his youth; and, at fifty-four, was still a very fine man. Few women could think more of their personal appearance than he did; nor could the valet of any new made lord be more delighted with the place he held in society. He considered the blessing of beauty as inferior only to the blessing of a baronetcy; and the Sir Walter Elliot, who united these gifts, was the constant object of his warmest respect and devotion.And we quickly see how little Sir Walter appreciates his daughter, Anne, and how much she is ignored by her vain sister Elizabeth:... but Anne, with an elegance of mind and sweetness of character, which must have placed her high with any people of real understanding, was nobody with either her father or sister; her word had no weight; her convenience was always to give way; \u2014 she was only Anne.Last year I also reread Sense and Sensibility, and in that book, I was struck by how well Austen described those who were vain and silly. There is plenty of that in Persuasion, but there are also excellent descriptions of love and feeling, and of the agony that only the heartsick person knows, that it shows the author's maturity. This novel was completed in 1816, and Miss Austen died the following year. I think her powers of observation and insight were never greater.While I think this to be a splendid novel, if you are new to Jane Austen, I do not think I would start here. I would recommend Pride and Prejudice to the novice; Persuasion should be delayed until you are ready. It is a treat all the more worth savoring because you have waited for it.

Who did not at one point suffer a love disappointment? Doesn\u2019t it follow that we deserve to dream that one day what was lost could be reconquered? Anne and Frederick meet again. Will Frederick change his opinion of Anne\u2019s character? \u201cA man does not recover from such devotion of the heart to such a woman! He ought not; he does not.\u201d Will Anne take her right to happiness into her own hands? \u201cShe hoped to be wise and reasonable in time; but alas! Alas! She must confess to herself that she was not wise yet.\u201dJane Austen with Persuasion gifts the reader with a bold and beautiful prose filled with intelligent satire. It abounds with common sense (maybe too much, for our romantic ideals?). In a world of painful social realities, Austen\u2019s heroine learns to navigate within these constricting times so as to try at last to reach for happiness.As she let herself be persuaded by those supposedly wiser and who should have known better, she set herself for years of suffering and an almost nothingness.\n\"Her eye half met Captain Wentworth's, a bow, a curtsey passed; she heard his voice; he said all that was right; the room seemed full, full of persons and voices, but a few minutes ended it. ...their visitor had bowed and was gone... \"It is over! it is over!\" she repeated to herself again and again, in nervous gratitude. \"The worst is over!\" ...She had seen him. They had met. They had been once more in the same room.\" \nAs far as reunions go, it was not easy at that, \"[h]is cold politeness, his ceremonious grace, were worse than anything.\" But Anne has not forgotten, far from it, but tries to discipline her feelings:\n\u201cSoon, however, she began to reason with herself, and try to be feeling less. Eight years, almost eight years had passed, since all had been given up. How absurd to be resuming the agitation which such an interval had banished into distance and indistinctness! What might not eight years do? Events of every description, changes, alienations, removals,--all, all must be comprised in it; and oblivion of the past--how natural, how certain too! It included nearly a third part of her own life.\u201d\nWhat I most enjoyed about Persuasion is Austen\u2019s witty irony when treating with the moral of the times. She is sarcastic, subtle and superbly witty. She writes in such a matter of fact way that the absurdity of her characters is in plain sight. She builds caricatures and sarcasm so plainly exposing Anne\u2019s vain father and frivolous sisters. Indeed, Sir Walter Elliot is a complete fool. \n\"Vanity was the beginning and the end of Sir Walter Elliot's character, vanity of person and of situation. He had been remarkably handsome in his youth; and, at fifty -four, was still a very fine man. Few women could think more of their personal appearance than he did, nor could the valet of any new made lord be more delighted with the place he held in society. He considered the blessing of beauty as inferior only to the blessing of a baronetcy; and the Sir Walter Elliot, who united those gifts, was the constant object of his warmest respect and devotion\"\nThe man is completely bankrupt but simply refuses to cut down on his ridiculously high expenditure or sell any of his assets. He is so obsessed with his outer image that he risks all to keep it in a state of what he perceives as perfection. Austen\u2019s prose is subtle and often veiled as we once again witness:\n\u201cI do not think I ever opened a book in my life which had not something to say upon woman's inconstancy. Songs and proverbs, all talk of woman's fickleness. But perhaps you will say, these were all written by men.\"\"Perhaps I shall. Yes, yes, if you please, no reference to examples in books. Men have had every advantage of us in telling their own story. Education has been theirs in so much higher a degree; the pen has been in their hands. I will not allow books to prove anything.\u201d\nAusten was ahead of her time; she could be considered a feminist. For her women should be allowed to strive for happiness, a novel idea in her times. Women should be allowed to marry for love and not only to increase their social standing or for money. Austen suggests that happiness lies in a woman\u2019s courage to act on her passion. However, Persuasion did not enthrall or mesmerize me. Even though Anne may be considered by many as one of Austen\u2019s most sympathetic heroines, I could not totally identify with her. First, she may be in grave peril of ceasing to exist, not physically but rather socially. That was the bane of women who did not marry in Austen\u2019s time. So, when we meet her, she is almost not there. We find her overlooked and ignored by virtually all around her. Indeed, the individual doesn\u2019t truly exist if not for his or her social connections. Finally, she comes thru to me as not that noteworthy, \"Anne an extremely pretty girl, with gentleness, sense and feeling\". She lacks the vivacity of Emma Woodhouse and the assuredness of Elizabeth Bennet. In fact, I felt for Anne but liked Elizabeth so much better. \u201cShe had been forced into prudence in her youth, she learned romance as she grew older: the natural sequel of an unnatural beginning.\u201dDespite all Persuasion qualities, I expected more from Anne. Nevertheless, not to be missed. ________I just upgraded Persuasion to 4 stars!After comment from my dear friend Jean-Paul, I started to doubt myself. Was I too hard with Anne? Can I judge her with 21st century standards? Certainly not. I could not imagine myself living in her time. Perhaps this out-of-time feeling is what led to my disillusionment.

(Originally published in 1817)A wonderfully pleasant classic by one of my favorite writers.When I was invited to review a new book, the premise of which, is a modern -day retelling of Jane Austen\u2019s Persuasion, I accepted immediately. But, once I\u2019d signed on, it occurred to me that I didn\u2019t remember any of the details of Persuasion. Surely, since Jane Austen has written some of my very favorite books, and I consider her to be one of my top five favorite authors, I have read every one of her books, right? Maybe I just needed a refresher. But, for the life of me, I have no memory of ever having read this one. So, despite my tight reading schedule, I just had to stop the assembly line and squeeze this one in. While there are already plenty of reviews for this book, I just wanted to share my experience of it with you. Up front, I must confess, this book, while listed as a favorite by many, is not mine, mainly because of the time it took to get to the meat of the story, and I felt the momentum dragged in some places. However, I did appreciate the more serious tone, the way Anne managed to dodge traditional female roles, and for her time, she is written as a strong, mature, character, who didn\u2019t mind pointing out the advantages men had in the way of education and the way they often thought of women as being \u2018inconstant\u2019. She wasn\u2019t exactly ironical, but she makes her point. I loved that! I also enjoyed the themes explored, concerning character traits, and the misjudgment, or maybe the PRE- judgment of those traits, while also touching on the disadvantages of remaining totally one- dimensional. This story also delves into the complexities of family, friendship, and of course love, and is well balanced and rounded. The writing of course is quite different from what we are accustomed to, or I should say, what I'm accustomed to, and at times the wordiness was challenging, but I did appreciate the manners, and activities described, and the characterizations. While this one isn\u2019t quite as sharp as other Austen novels, in my opinion, and is a just a bit more pensive than usual, I still found myself looking forward to the time I could spend with Anne inside her pre-Victorian landscape. 4 stars"}, {"userName": "Vicki", "userReviewDate": "Aug 18, 2007", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/265580-vicki", "userReview": "This is my favorite Austen book (actually, it's my favorite book, period). I originally read it in grad school, in an Austen scholarship class. I'd tried reading it before, when I was a bit younger, but couldn't get into it. But you think differently after being made to read every Austen novel. You think differently as you get a little older, and you're a little calmer, I guess. Most of Austen's novels have the same ingredients -- mysterious strangers, people who aren't what they seem, insensible parents, good and true friends, false friends, clowns and heroes, you name it. Those elements are in pretty much each of her novels, and why not, I guess? It's how she viewed things. But there's something about \"Persuasion.\" Perhaps it's best to read this book last, so you can appreciate the differences more. It's my favorite of her books because it's elegant, but also bittersweet. She's telling us that things don't always mystically come together the way we intend them. It's a slim, elegant little novel, completely readable, and filled with excellent \"morality.\" And there's a finality to it -- wonderful commentary on the difference between women and men, and whether or not books can tell us anything. She wrote this novel in response to a letter from a niece of hers, who was asking for advice about accepting a marriage proposal. Austen spends the whole book telling us about the consequences of \"yielding to persuasion.\" Also the consequences of attempting to persuade. It's still a good lesson.The whole book takes place in autumn, and has such a sad, sweet quality to it -- the joy that arises in the book is so well-earned.

While I have certain reservation on that conviction, I do see why it is said so. By all means Persuasion is different to her preceding work that I have read: Pride and Prejudice, Sense and Sensibility and Emma. In all these work mentioned, her writing is light and glow with \"sparkle and spirit\". But in Persuasion, her spirited and sparkle writing is replaced by more mature writing. It is still light but there is more warmth and emotion in her writing as well as more depth and colour. In short, Jane Austen has written Persuasion with so much of feeling so as to make it stand tall among all her other work. The main female protagonist, Anne Elliot, is a mature heroine who have lost her \"youth and bloom\" over the years as a result of her pinning for a lost love. She is unloved and neglected by the family except by the dear friend Lady Russel. But she is courageous and has a superior, cultivated mind so as to bear all indifference and to endure her loss without resentment. Anne reminded me of Cinderella; only difference was that she had an indifferent father instead of a wicked step mother. Anne is strong. She is self-made, kind and has a keen intelligence. She secures her own happiness more or less by her own means supported by circumstances rather than any support rendered by family or friends. Anne stands out from most of Austen heroines. Perhaps she is equal in stamina to the much loved Elizabeth Bennet in Pride and Prejudice. And I don't know if it is because of my own partiality and obsession with Elizabeth Bennet over the years, but I couldn't help feeling that Anne is sort of a mature version of Elizabeth, only that Elizabeth would not have been easily persuaded. Captain Wentworth is yet another beloved hero and could easily be placed in line with Darcy, Knightley and Colonel Brandon. I'm amazed at Jane Austen's ability to create these heroes and heroines who are felt so real and who would undoubtedly occupy a place in all reader hearts. No Austen hero or heroine is ever forgotten and for centuries they have survived to become \"immortal\". Like in all Jane Austen work, Persuasion too have a sweet love story. But unlike in others, it is a mature love; one that was found, lost and found again; one that has endured an eight and half years of separation. And what is more striking is Austen's excellent and emotional writing of Anne's feelings: her pain and suffering for having given up the man she loved; her painful situation at having to meet him after eight and half years; her pain at his cool reception of her; her agony in watching of him pursue another woman very much younger than her; her knowledge that her once pretty looks and youth have been robbed over and she would no longer be attractive in his eyes.; her knowledge that she has lost her chance to be happy again; and above all the her profound realization that she still loved him deeply and dearly. All these emotions are detailed and beautifully and touchingly expressed that they almost broke my heart. And as the case in all Jane Austen work, in Persuasion too, Austen's social commentary and criticism and realism is preserved. Through the characters of Sir Walter, Elizabeth and Mary, she exposes the vanity of the titled and mocks them for their air of superiority. At the same time she gently hints at the decline of superiority maintained by the titled class through the declining in wealth of Sir Walter, and shows the emergence of a new wealthy class in Naval Officers who would gradually elevate their position in the society with their wealth, gaining respect and admiration. Two brothers of Jane Austen were Navy officers and perhaps, this was her tribute to them. Overall, it is a beautiful book. I loved every minute of reading it. And for the first time I found another Austen work equal to her Pride and Prejudice."}, {"userName": "Duchess Nicole", "userReviewDate": "May 27, 2011", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/2204947-duchess-nicole", "userReview": "[image error]"}, {"userName": "Sean Gibson", "userReviewDate": "May 21, 2015", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/20955173-sean-gibson", "userReview": "Shiftless layabouts lay about shiftlessly, search for love in all the wrong places, find it.Okay, so, it's not Jane Austen's best work.

The brutally paced parsing of the text this time around is probably why I found the introduction and afterword so insufferable. Here I was, armed to the teeth with the single minded focus of hacking through the narrative foliage for tidbits of the ideal male mate as prescribed by Austenian code, only to be faced with nearly thirty page long bookends of Sparknote analysis and chewed out trivialities. It's the result of the worst sort of blinkered presumption that, wherein since English isn't rocket science and Austen is Austen, a minimum level of effort is more than acceptable when it comes to getting at the marrow of the stakes at hand. Mind you, anyone who tries to take my words and use them to condemn the Millennials or the immigrants or whatever newfangled ideologies are disturbing their self-complacent entitlement can take a hike. Austen knew what she was about when she made every novel of hers a matter of money, so if you want more of me and less of the status quo, be sure to have your ballots and checkbooks in hand.I've done enough rereading this past school quarter to no longer look at it as most certain slog if done within five years of the previous, but there's also the quality school environment to consider. Beyond all the bureaucracy of identity politics (I'd gladly trade places with the neurotypicals whose biggest concern is being hated by those who they think they want to \"help\"), there's nothing I love more than new critical perspectives, new paradigms, new ways of chewing through texts which, for all that, hold up admirably enough to justify the expenditure. The hardship, of course, is that I am no longer the person who wrote that first review below after reading the book in community college. I am the one who's encountering the text with the new abstract knowledge of Austen's family having been involved in the slave trade and the new practical knowledge of negotiating with those whose responsibility for college students amounts to little more than a subtle sadism. Deep down, I still enjoy Anne Elliot's character traits on an instinctual level, but I would no longer hesitate on tearing it and this novel apart to suit my analytical purposes. An underdog complex, perhaps, especially when considering this didn't dislodge P&P as my favorite after all, but I want to see the eight-and-a-half years of angst and painful self-reflexivity, not the pretense that everything worked cause, really, nothing had to change.Having now moved through the complete set of complete novels, there is a much stronger feel for the world within which the heroine moves with all its self-obsessed people, manipulating people, disabled people, female people, children, colonialism, sailors, class, and the socioeconomic politics of gender than there was in Sense and Sensibility, in the sense of serious consideration that does not pretend the current hegemony is the universal truth. Propriety no longer bows in the face of masculine entitlement, and what plot movement there was in the form of death and degradation was not passed over with the modicum of effort that is deus ex machina. One could make an argument for development/complication/experimentation of prose and grammar, but I am not such a one. I took this class called Jane Austen and Her Peers with the aim of enhancing an experience that had thus far been a little here, a little there, sizable amounts of love mingling with medium levels of indifference and even some measures of hatred. I'd say I got my money's worth. P.S. Completely missed the part where one of the characters criticizes the main antagonist as having a small dick the first time around. The joys of analysis. ---1/27/154.5/5For every work I read and review on here, I read about three decent sized novel's worth of online fanfic. This has lead to some weird and wonderful critical analysis skills, an example being my discussion of a key plot point that started off smooth, spazzed out of giddy control, and ended with a \"framing of narratives\" commentary that I didn't even know I could do. I blame the afterword of this edition with its \"Here's ten academic jargon things that Austen was great at!\" that totally messed with my shipping flow, but hey. The prof liked it well enough, even though I'm certain my \"He figured out he actually wanted to do the thing by talking about something completely different from the thing\" raised no small number of eyebrows.Anyway. Persuasion! Persuasion. I'm so glad the class picked this up because, one, christ this class is a sausage fest, and two, this book is so clever that I absolutely must to do my first paper on it. You'd think I'd have picked up on this during my three previous Austen books, but either I don't remember them that well or this last one of hers is another kettle of fish entirely. The introduction supported my suspicions a measure with talk about class differences and the coming of a nouveau riche type excitement that Austen was actually pretty okay with, but what really got me was the rhetoric and how invested the author was in stretching those three terms as far as they could go.Unlike the Swift and Pope and Gay that came before in class with their satire and misanthropy and lazy ass indictment of humanity via, you guessed it, women and non-Europeans, Austen's invested in making things work. It comes across the clearest in this work because of the problems she's wrestling of landed gentry versus incoming rich Navy personnel, age, gender roles, cultural ideologies formed by unbalanced representation, and what, ultimately, is right in terms of when, why, and how. This, mind you, is all coming across through a \"comedy of manners\", a romance wherein everything must happen carefully, subtly, and with the most fine-tuned pieces of rhetoric that English can afford. In short, persuasions of varying overtness and strength prove equally true under various circumstances that no one can always get the right of, or as put by this gem of a gem of a quote:\nThere, he had learnt to distinguish between the steadiness of principle and the obstinacy of self-will, between the daring of heedlessness and the resolution of a collected mind.\nMorality does not operate in a vacuum, for better or for worse, and any author who can successfully wrestle a meaning from it deserves praise. Stigma against drawing room romances be damned, a writer's apprehension is not limited by the share of humanity they were given. Besides, if you want to be able to appreciate the Deep Universal Things and giggle at the same time, Austen's your woman.P.S. For all my praise, I didn't like this as much as Pride and Prejudice because of the comparatively low potential for hate-sex.

Why? I didn't hear you ask. Because subsequent to that I went on to read all her other novels, there are not that many of them, I am not sure how that happened either, I think it was because I like her prose regardless of the story, and most importantly, there are some great reading of her books on Librivox, either by Elizabeth Klett or Karen Savage, two nice ladies who have sweet voices. In spite of not being English, Ms. Klett does very pleasant readings of Jane Austen books, with all the cadences nuances and warmth that I could reasonably ask for. I recently enjoyed Northanger Abbey, loved Mansfield Park,  Sense and Sensibility,  Emma and of course  Pride and Prejudice. So I thought I would loop back to Persuasion as I have a better appreciation of Austen now. Unfortunately, I am still unable to give my approbation to this particular volume as it is still not sufficiently felicitous. The most popular Austen novels seem to have alliterative titles along the line of \u201cSomething and Something else\u201d. Perhaps Persuasion would work better if it was called \u201cPersuasion and Persecution\u201d? However, while reading the first half of the book I thought a more suitable title would be:Honestly, this book is overpopulated by what my English friends charmingly call silly cows; not that the protagonist Anne Eliot is of bovine intellect but she seems to make her life unnecessarily complicated. She used to be engaged to Captain Frederick Wentworth but Mrs. Russell, another silly meddling woman, persuaded her that he is not quite up to snuff, financially. That was enough persuasion for Anne to break off the engagement. Seven years later Freddy comes back to England from the Napoleonic Wars, a successful, rich and respected naval officer. Anne\u2019s sister Mary Elliot and sister-in-law Louisa Musgrove compete for the silliest cows on the British Isles, the former never stops talking nonsense, the other hilariously jumps off some stairs for a laugh and knocks herself out*. Louisa has a sister called Henrietta who is engaged to a man called Charles Hayter. Charles takes an instant dislike to Freddy Wentworth who he sees flirting with his fianc\u00e9e, and besides Hayter\u2019s gonna hate. Soon, William Elliot, a slightly mysterious distant cousin of Anne\u2019s shows up and starts flirting with her just to add more complication for the Freddy-Anne relationship. William is from Austen\u2019s stock of charming bad boy/cad characters so he is soon sent packing. Captain Freddy is pissed off with Anne for dumping him, and Anne feels guilty as hell but still fancies the dude who also secretly carries a little torch for her. So how will these two crazy kids get together?For me, Persuasion is Jane Austen\u2019s weakest novel. The prose is as beautiful as ever, but the storyline is something of a non-event, and the protagonist is not as lively or acerbic as Austen\u2019s best characters like Elizabeth Bennett or Elinor Dashwood, Captain Fred, the love interest is standard Austen po-faced fellow. I think the novel\u2019s main theme is \"don\u2019t be so damn impressionable!\" (i.e. easily persuaded, hence the title). Is mehsome a word? If it is this book is mehsome.Notes:* As seen in this dramatized video clip.\u2022 Very nice free Librivox audiobook edition read by Elizabeth Klett,\u2022 There are too many characters in this book, most of them don\u2019t contribute very much to the narrative. Look at this damn family tree!Quotes:Personal size and mental sorrow have certainly no necessary proportions. A large bulky figure has as good a right to be in deep affliction, as the most graceful set of limbs in the world. But, fair or not fair, there are unbecoming conjunctions, which reason will patronize in vain--which taste cannot tolerate--which ridicule will seize.I did not understand you. I shut my eyes, and would not understand you, or do you justice. This is a recollection which ought to make me forgive every one sooner than myself. I must endeavour to subdue my mind to my fortune.

I always imagine Jane, herself, meeting up with her lost love and finally marrying him. So romantic...except, well, there are all those lost years of loneliness. And, in the case of Anne Eliot, there's the years of slowly drifting into the woodwork. When the one love-of-her- life comes back, he chases after two younger prettier girls right in front of her. And he's the good guy! Huh? Of course, the infinite Jane lets the reader see more sides of every character. The LOHLife doesn't know how she feels, because Anne dumped him cold. We are led to believe that it was because she was 'persuaded' with bad advice. But, in the end we understand that it actually wasn't bad advice...they were both very young and practically broke. A liitle maturity (on her part) and a little fortune (on his part) brings them to their happy ending. Something I found interesting in this novel is the way Austen introduces the (kinda) villain of the piece. She said he was not handsome. Usually the jerks are handsome and the nice guys are plain.

In Jane Austen's Persuasion our hero and heroine are neither interesting nor do they have an obvious magnetic attraction for one another. As readers we always knew they'd get together in the end, and yet we're still glad they do. That's the power of Jane Austen's persuasion!Unlike in some of Austen's better work, there is a twist, but not much of a triangle. And I felt the twist to be more Bronte-esque, as in the revealing of a horrible secret. Persuasion lacks a complicated plot, and what it does have doesn't come even remotely close to that of Pride and Prejudice or Sense and Sensibility. There's plenty of irritating busybodies, ala Emma, but Austen thankfully refrained from making them too irritating. No, here there is a good balance of silly characters and solid salts-of-the-earth. On a personal note, I found it refreshing to read so much about the navy in this book. During the Napoleonic Wars, in which Britain fought France over two decades, their superior navy was an integral part of their eventual success. Some of Austen's books are meant to take place during this tumultuous time and yet the war is hardly ever mentioned. Occasionally the female characters will fawn over some officer or other, but that's about it. In Persuasion, a naval captain is our heroine's love interest, an admiral takes lodging at her stately home and numerous other gentlemen of the navy fill out the periphery. Heck, a ship or two is even referred by name! I don't demand, or even think a book whose focus is meant to be on women finding love should be all about what the men are doing during a war, but it's nice to see that the women at least realize their country is at war, as it's nice to see Austen was not completely insensible of it either. It is quite correct that she should devote the bulk of her work to describing the home front war women of her society fought...the war to conquer a suitable man."}, {"userName": "Foad",

I felt like I didn't know Captain Wentworth as well as I got to know Mr Darcy and I wasn't as pulled in by the story. The writing is still beautiful and I loved getting an insight into the 1800's, but it wasn't my favourite.Around the Year in 52 Books Challenge Notes:- 15. A book set in the past (more than 100 years ago)"}], "description": "Twenty-seven-year old Anne Elliot is Austen's most adult heroine. Eight years before the story proper begins, she is happily betrothed to a naval officer, Frederick Wentworth, but she precipitously breaks off the engagement when persuaded by her friend Lady Russell that such a match is unworthy. The breakup produces in Anne a deep and long-lasting regret. When later Wentworth returns from sea a rich and successful captain, he finds Anne's family on the brink of financial ruin and his own sister a tenant in Kellynch Hall, the Elliot estate. All the tension of the novel revolves around one question: Will Anne and Wentworth be reunited in their love?Jane Austen once compared her writing to painting on a little bit of ivory, 2 inches square. Readers of Persuasion will discover that neither her skill for delicate, ironic observations on social custom, love, and marriage nor her ability to apply a sharp focus lens to English manners and morals has deserted her in her final finished work.", "title": "Persuasion", "url": "http://www.goodreads.com/book/show/2156.Persuasion", "average": 4.13, "cover": "https://images.gr-assets.com/books/1385172413l/2156.jpg", "reviews": 14305, "authors": [{"url": "https://www.goodreads.com/author/show/1265.Jane_Austen", "name": "Jane Austen"}, {"url": "https://www.goodreads.com/author/show/362983.James_Kinsley", "name": "James Kinsley"}, {"url": "https://www.goodreads.com/author/show/26484.Deidre_Shauna_Lynch", "name": "Deidre Shauna Lynch"}], "type": ["Classics", "Fiction", "Romance"], "outlinks": ["http://www.goodreads.com/book/show/2156.Persuasion", "http://www.goodreads.com/book/show/16045870-persuasion", "http://www.goodreads.com/book/show/926244.Persuasion", "http://www.goodreads.com/book/show/11758566-persuasion", "http://www.goodreads.com/book/show/21937378-persuasion", "http://www.goodreads.com/book/show/31693.Persuasion", "http://www.goodreads.com/book/show/37546.Persuasion", "http://www.goodreads.com/book/show/3234126-persuasion", "http://www.goodreads.com/book/show/33814694-persuasion", "http://www.goodreads.com/book/show/468274.Persuasion", "http://www.goodreads.com/book/show/2511353.Persuasion", "http://www.goodreads.com/book/show/442527.Persuasion", "http://www.goodreads.com/book/show/7050469", "http://www.goodreads.com/book/show/1778948._", "http://www.goodreads.com/book/show/18300265-persuasion", "http://www.goodreads.com/book/show/1885.Pride_and_Prejudice", "http://www.goodreads.com/book/show/14935.Sense_and_Sensibility", "http://www.goodreads.com/book/show/6969.Emma", "http://www.goodreads.com/book/show/45032.Mansfield_Park", "http://www.goodreads.com/book/show/50398.Northanger_Abbey", "http://www.goodreads.com/book/show/39928984-mercy-among-the-children", "http://www.goodreads.com/book/show/20620995-take-me-with-you", "http://www.goodreads.com/book/show/6565401-five-quarters-of-the-orange", "http://www.goodreads.com/book/show/25600623-the-diver-s-clothes-lie-empty", "http://www.goodreads.com/book/show/18867378-the-traveler-s-gift", "http://www.goodreads.com/book/show/40198373-big-stone-gap", "http://www.goodreads.com/book/show/40198387-friendship-bread", "http://www.goodreads.com/book/show/40193401-the-little-giant-of-aberdeen-county", "http://www.goodreads.com/book/show/35963775-her-sister-s-shoes", "http://www.goodreads.com/book/show/22617980-the-rock-harbor-collection", "http://www.goodreads.com/book/show/35269080-a-thousand-tomorrows", "http://www.goodreads.com/book/show/40204902-caravans", "http://www.goodreads.com/book/show/31192689-shoeless-joe", "http://www.goodreads.com/book/show/40204877-a-hero-of-france", "http://www.goodreads.com/book/show/6473113-death-in-venice", "http://www.goodreads.com/book/show/40266651-the-tilted-world", "http://www.goodreads.com/book/show/33117501-blonde", "http://www.goodreads.com/book/show/36546758-ever-after", "http://www.goodreads.com/book/show/40193580-rescue", "http://www.goodreads.com/book/show/22032837-the-pearl-that-broke-its-shell", "http://www.goodreads.com/book/show/36589911-the-lords-of-discipline", "http://www.goodreads.com/book/show/11963271-the-sheltering-sky", "http://www.goodreads.com/book/show/25596951-the-dressmaker-s-war", "http://www.goodreads.com/book/show/35120598-gena-finn", "http://www.goodreads.com/book/show/29550710-a-charles-martin-collection", "http://www.goodreads.com/book/show/19977229-remember-tuesday-morning", "http://www.goodreads.com/book/show/8530701-a-town-like-alice", "http://www.goodreads.com/book/show/35414455-the-other-alcott", "http://www.goodreads.com/book/show/18800554-the-scavenger-s-daughters", "http://www.goodreads.com/book/show/40205036-under-the-udala-trees", "http://www.goodreads.com/book/show/32861105-the-streets-have-no-king", "http://www.goodreads.com/book/show/39929534-the-passion", "http://www.goodreads.com/book/show/35654710-this-dark-road-to-mercy", "http://www.goodreads.com/book/show/11513574-breath-eyes-memory", "http://www.goodreads.com/book/show/21942189-the-language-of-hoofbeats", "http://www.goodreads.com/book/show/18165412-house-of-bathory", "http://www.goodreads.com/book/show/37984397-we-own-the-sky", "http://www.goodreads.com/book/show/36004055-not-perfect"]}
