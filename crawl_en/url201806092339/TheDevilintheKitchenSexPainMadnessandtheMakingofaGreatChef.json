It is really all Anthony Bourdain\u2019s fault. I read Kitchen Confidential after catching his show on the Travel Channel. I enjoyed his humor on the show and hoped that his amusing commentary would show up in the book. Reading the book was just like how I would expect a conversation to go with Bourdain. He was hilariously irreverent about everything. He certainly convinced me that cutting edge chefs had a lot in common with the dissenting, maverick attitudes of the gunslingers of the Old West. Only pistols at noon are exchanged for frying pans.\u201dFrom the moment my chef pals and I got a look at Marco Pierre White\u2019s first cookbook--and at photos of the Man Himself, in all his haggard, debauched-looking, obsessively driven glory---we dreamed of nothing more than to be just like him. He made history.\u201d-- Anthony BourdainTo say that White is driven is an understatement. His desire to be the best chef in not only Britain but in the world completely dominated his life from the time he became conscious in the morning until the time he passed out at night. He wanted three Michelin stars more than he wanted to be rich or famous. He blew up his marriages. He threw condiments at his staff. He called them demeaning names. He tortured them. It was impossible for anyone to match his expectations for himself. \u201dIn the kitchen, the first three weeks was the toughest period for the new boys. By the end of it they were usually fucked, having lost a stone in weight, gained a dazed expression and cried themselves dry. That was when the shaking started---and when many of them left. One day they were there, the next they were gone. If they could make it into the fourth week, they were doing well.\u201d\nYou might recognize Gordon Ramsay, who worked for the temperamental White for almost three years before having enough of the tirades. THE Mario Batali or as he was known in White\u2019s kitchen Rusty Bollocks is one of those guys who worked for him. He was an especially favorite target for White because he was fat and nice. So you would think, now that Batali is one of the most famous chefs in the world, that he might want to skewer White for some of that rough treatment. Let\u2019s check in and see what Batali says about him: \u201cMarco is a gift to humanity, with more passion per pound than anyone else I have ever met. His story is genius, his voice his own\u2026.Marco is still my hero.\u201dWTH? Batali must be suffering from Stockholm Syndrome. I would love to eat White\u2019s food, but after reading about how he treats his workers, I\u2019d rather scoop horse crap off the sidewalks of London than work for this guy. I\u2019d rather be the chief bedding washer at a Moroccan whorehouse than work for this guy. I\u2019d rather jack off a bull for semen collection than work for this guy. Whoa! Wait! I think I found the line in the sand...okay I\u2019d rather work for him than do that. He does become the youngest chef to ever win three Michelin stars, but each star is stained with the sweat, blood, and tears of anyone who ever labored for him. White worked for every great chef in Britain to learn as much as he could from them and then apply his own particular twist to their own greatness. He too was tortured by the system the same way he tortured his own staff, and like with the food, he put his own particular twist on that as well. He was on top of the world, untouchable. He had women slipping up to his private office for a quickie while their husbands waited patiently in the dining room for them to return from the \u201cbathroom.\u201d He threw diners out of his restaurant if they complained. If someone could not understand what he was all about, he did not have time for them. \nWomen were waiting in line to see The Devil in the Kitchen.He even went into business with the toughest man in London, My-Cool Caine. Of course, they had a falling out as well, not surprising. You don\u2019t mess around with Caine, and you don\u2019t mess around with White. It was like putting two rocks in a blender. White does mix in some tips on cooking that are more about seeing food differently. Seeing an egg for more than just an egg: \u201dCook\u2019s brain. It\u2019s the ability to visualize the food on the plate, as a picture in the mind, and then work backward.\u201d\u201dFor instance, let\u2019s just think for a moment about a fried egg. It\u2019s not the most inspired dish, but then again, if you can\u2019t cook an egg, what can you cook? And actually, a perfectly cooked fried egg is quite beautiful.\u201dI\u2019m an eggoholic, so I was visualizing the clouds parting, and a ray of sunshine beaming down to turn the yolk to a yellow flame.It really comes down to the fact that Marco Pierre White may not have been the easiest man to like, but many of the people who worked for him loved him. The tree of successful Chefs who learned from him and passed his knowledge onto another generation of chefs is wide and deep with numerous branches that can be found in just about any high-end restaurant in the world. He is still to this day the youngest chef to EVER win three Michelin stars. He was the grandson of a chef, the son of a chef, and his brothers were chefs, so the stove was his cradle. Sauces were his milk. He made music with skillets and ladles. He became the Mick Jagger of the kitchen.

I think I might like to have him cook for me, but I wouldn't want to know him in any other context. I wouldn't want to be his wife and I sure as hell wouldn't want to work for him.I understand that to some degree a mercurial, self-confident demeanor is a job requirement for being a Michelin-3-star-caliber chef but White comes off as a 5-star jerk. He's very quick to quote positive reviews and people who bolster his image as a sex-god Mick-Jagger-of-the-kitchen. I daresay there are probably four times as many ex-wives, ex-girlfriends, ex-employers and ex-employees who would not be so willing to burnish his self-image. Funny, we don't seem to hear from *any* of them in this self-love-fest.He's had an interesting life and a remarkable career, and he has a compelling story to tell. You just get the sense that there's a lot he's left out -- like anything that would cast him in the unflattering light he likely deserves."}, {"userName": "Jim", "userReviewDate": "Dec 05, 2010", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/4535798-jim", "userReview": "By the end of this book, Marco is neither a devil nor in the kitchen, but you do understand why he once was both. Undeniably a difficult character, the autobiography goes some way to explaining the drive and motivations behind the man and I did wonder if a couple of therapy sessions had added to some of the more reflective and self-analytical passages. On the other hand, selective amnesia is often also in evidence especially when concerning business or personal relationships, although he does resist having a malicious swipe at those involved, perhaps an acknowledgment of his part in the downfalls. There is no doubt he inspired and changed a generation of chefs and drove himself to the edge of physical and mental breakdown in trying to achieve a perfection that would bring some sense of inner satisfaction, but you are left in no doubt that the person he wanted to please most of all died when he was too young to impress her. The ghost of Marco's mother is a constant presence in his life, and as he recounts the ups and downs of his career you feel that inner peace is something that he's always struggled and is still struggling to find. As an autobiography, this is quite a revealing and straightforward book but also entertaining and especially evocative of Eighties London.

If this sounds like I'm damning it with faint praise I kinda am. . .Marco White is the self-described \"first celebrity chef\" aka \"rock star chef\" - he made great sacrifices to gain three Michelin Guide stars for one of his restaurants and is clearly passionate about high cuisine. It comes across and is compelling. At the end of the day this did not transcend the genre. . .i.e. a memoir by someone at the top of their field. Nothing really remains at the end. . .he got his stars, he was kind of an asshole at times (kicking bores out of his dining hall is a recurring theme) and then he retired. He also had sex a few times. I think what hinders the greatness of this book is a lack of self-doubt - which is truly incredible to witness but trends the overall affect of this book to the average. You can admire his amazing achievement (try to make sense of the recipes in the back) but are left with a portrait of a damaged man. . .unappealing for his absence of love and humanity. Still this was a good read. . .fun for people into the kitchen. I think though - for punters like us - Heat by Bill Buford is the top of the heap."}, {"userName": "Ms.pegasus", "userReviewDate": "Feb 17, 2013", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/5015851-ms-pegasus", "userReview": "You've achieved your life's dream at age 33. Now what? It's a problem few of us even think about, let alone encounter. It's the problem Chef Marco White faced in 1995. The choices he made at that point were, like his life, unusual and courageous.DEVIL IN THE KITCHEN is Marco White's memoir. It's the story of a boy from a financially strapped working class home in Leeds. It chronicles the distress of a boy who lost his mother at age 6, who feared the loss of his father from terminal cancer four years later, who was estranged from his father in late adolescence and who floundered through two unsuccessful marriages and nearly a dozen irretrievably damaged relationships in pursuit of his dream.Much of his story follows an established template -- long hours, grueling work, physical discomfort, verbal abuse, sleep deprivation and unremitting pressure. Both physically and mentally, White focuses on his career as if waging a battle campaign. It is no accident that he gets his culinary training on the job, moving from one Michelin starred restaurant to the next. At his two star restaurant, Harvey's, he recounts cringe-worthy anecdotes which reflect a manic obsession for perfectionism that make Hell's Kitchen's Gordon Ramsay seem like he is on tranquilizers by comparison.For a chef's memoir, the book touches on food in a cursory way. Chef White does, however, reflect on the grandeur of the Escoffier tradition. White got his start at the Hotel St. George, and his appreciation of the \u201cGrand Hotel\u201d era echos the admiration for Chef Paul Bocuse evident in KNIVES AT DAWN. White has a keen appreciation of history. He contrasts early on the differences between the era of his youth and the present. Diners then were much less sophisticated, and the experimentation we have come to take for granted grew out of a few gradual experiments by chefs considered radical in their day. This was especially true in Britain, where comfort food like Toad in the Hole was both expected and ubiquitous. Chef White is not an introspective man. Behind all of his stories, we sense the pervasive influence of British class distinctions. When Prince Charles mistakenly believes he is French (his full name is Marco Pierre White) it is a social miscue that triggers red-faced embarrassment on the prince's part. It's hard for an American to think of such a situation as anything other than merely funny. While denying that he envied the rich and famous in his youth, one can't help but wonder if young Marco didn't envy their sense of belonging. The contrast between his ambitions and his upbringing constantly seemed to make him an outsider in any group. At Harvey's, Chef White's almost sadistic treatment of offending restaurant patrons seems not unlike summary evictions from the perfect-fit world he is attempting to create for himself. As the book ends, Chef White has decided to give up his Michelin stars and leave the kitchen. The new chapter in his life anticipates business ventures and publicity stints \u2013 a less stressful route than his demanding kitchen routine. Hopefully, he declares: \u201cThe process of writing this book helped me to leave behind the baggage that was weighing me down and allowed me to move forward with my life. I like to think that I've developed, for the best.\u201d Despite recent setbacks, the reader hopes as much for him as well. Look at the portraits of him by Bob Carlos Clarke on the web and you will see a charismatic intensity that commands at least interest, if not admiration."}, {"userName": "Shahine Ardeshir", "userReviewDate": "May 12, 2013", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/6036595-shahine-ardeshir", "userReview": "Silly as it sounds, I started reading this book after watching Marco Pierre White in action on Masterchef Professionals. I know precious little about fine dining, but I liked the man from what I saw, and thought that a book about his life would be interesting.I was half-right. The book begins beautifully. In fact, the first half was one of the best autobiographies I\u2019d read - about how a young boy from very humble beginnings started a life and built a career in the culinary scene in England. It was honest without being sappy, insightful without being too detail-laden. I thoroughly enjoyed it.Unfortunately, it went off the rail for me thereafter. I felt like Mr White had a list of incidents (mostly reported in the press) that he felt the need to explain or address. Fair enough, but I\u2019m not sure this was the place to do it. The book\u2019s flow vanished completely, and became a series of reactions and recounting of specific scenes or words exchanged. I wasn\u2019t interested and eventually, got quite bored.I come out of this read still greatly respecting the man - he\u2019s obviously a legend in the world of chefs. But I think his editor did him a disservice in the second half. The first half is good enough that I\u2019d recommend you read it anyway - but be ready for a disappointing change some way in."}, {"userName": "grundoon", "userReviewDate": "Sep 30, 2011", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/6229558-grundoon", "userReview": "3.5 Wow, this is a tough one to rate. On the one hand, it's an autobiography (ghostwritten) of a charismatic, narcissistic, volatile, wildly-talented chef. On the other hand, it's an autobiography of a charismatic, narcissistic, volatile, wildly-talented chef. The story is entertaining, mostly compelling, and there's a good deal of culinary and kitchen life. But the further you read, the more you notice how much has been left out and how just about every anecdote comes padded in justification, righteousness or plea for understanding. How often the word \"friend\" appears when name-dropping, yet in the end seems a concept perhaps utterly foreign to him. Conveniently avoided are detail (or even mention) of issues pertaining to his frequent moves in kitchens and partnerships, and there's essentially nothing at all about his post-kitchen career as restaurateur. If an ultimately too-short MPW-sanitized MPW on MPW appeals, this is a terrific read (and I'd give high recommendations to do so to anybody in the biz)."}, {"userName": "Eat.Sleep.Lift.Read.", "userReviewDate": "Aug 23, 2017", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/15403298-eat-sleep-lift-read", "userReview": "A decent and fun romp through the life of a decent chef.

James Steen (the ghost-writer) has done such a superb job here that found myself wishing that I could now read his book of how he wrote this book. I can\u2019t believe that he could have had an easy time of it. Good 1980s restaurant food WAS memorable, though mainly because of the exuberant decorative extremes it hit before a modicum of sense reasserted itself. MPW had (still has?) that subtle sense \u2018in spades\u2019; as glimpsed throughout this book. His astute \u2018blink and you miss it\u2019 observation as to how Albert Roux \u201ctouched the dishes with his eyes\u201d (pg.55) before they were sent to table, speaks absolute volumes about quality. Today, I am intensely saddened, dislike, and indeed actively avoid restaurants where the chef whose name advertises and prices the restaurant is not to be routinely found in that kitchen.MPW is clearly a terrifically complex but deeply talented man. I might not commission him to lead a corporate training course on leadership skills; but I bet that even today he has the gritty pugnacious ability to inspire those who have no hope within themselves to believe that they too can take control and change their lives for the better. I so very much hope that MPW has now found his own inner peace and happiness, is still fishing on the River Test, and that he thoroughly enjoys cooking what he catches."}, {"userName": "Jim George", "userReviewDate": "Oct 23, 2011", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/4501999-jim-george", "userReview": "Marco is undoubtedly a brilliant chef, his accolades and accomplishments proceed him in the culinary world of fine food.

Hillocks of puff pastry or shivering gelees sheltering stronger stuff inside: fish, eggs, puddings of blood or brain.In a way, The Devil in the Kitchen is like those dishes: under the puff pastry of celebrity memoir lurks the tale of a brutally ambitious chef, wanting nothing in life but his own three Michelin star restaurant. Hands down the best parts of this book are when White talks about his strategies for achieving first employment and then advancement at each of the two star restaurants in London, what he learns from each, and how he contrives to top them. If the chef life interests you, it's meaty and intoxicating stuff.But just as with a meal, you have to consider the book as a whole...and it is that bland, underbaked puff pastry that fails the reader in the end. White had a colorful childhood and years of celebrity so he doesn't lack for stories, but he very actively eschews introspection.This works when he and ghost writer James Steen\u2014and I have to say I found entirely charming the amount of praise White heaps on Steen in the Acknowledgments (or perhaps Steen heaps on himself, maybe?\u2014are making a case for White as a fiend driven only to become the best chef in England, but fails badly when White hits that goal and decides to retire from the kitchen at the age of 35. There are a few paragraphs talking about the decision and they all but shrug on the page at you.Worse, the book continues from there, so one gets to hear more about White's devotion to opening restaurants and earning money, to children he rarely bothers to name and a wife he never bothers to describe. A long semi-amusing anecdote about business partner Michael Caine suggests any number of things about White (an obsession with the rich and successful, his own fiscal conservatism, a near-constant opportunism) that cast all the previous pages in lights other than how White would want them perceived.I don't care much if that's the case, frankly: I'm more than happy to read about people I wouldn't want to share a meal with, but a memoir should at least be entertainingly fraudulent.But yeah, I'm giving it three stars because the stuff I enjoyed, I enjoyed a lot. There are probably better books out there that give more insight into the mind of a successful chef, but this was one of my first. Until a better one comes along and really shows me what I've been missing, I can't help but have some fondness for The Devil in the Kitchen."}, {"userName": "Shelly ", "userReviewDate": "Mar 19, 2008", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/803353-shelly", "userReview": "Marco Pierre White's story is interesting. I'm not a \"foodie\", but I still enjoyed it. The writing style was kind of rough at times, extremely conversational and would sometimes jump from one topic to the next without much transition (surprised he had a ghostwriter), but all in all it was an entertaining read.White, like most chefs, is a hothead. His infamous temper was apparently the talk of London's restaurant world during his heyday. Although to me he seems to go overboard at some times--like when a member of his kitchen staff complained of being too hot and he pulled a Zoro on the kid: hacking up his clothes with a butcher knife--a lot of his blow-ups are funny to hear about. One of my favorites was when, at the height of his popularity, a customer ordered fries at one of his very \"posh\" restaurants and insisted Marco make them himself. It was annoying enough to him that patrons would request he make their meal himself--but to order fries off the menu and demand that Marco prepare them too! The nerve! Marco ending up making the fries himself, then charged the guy 25 pounds (sorry, I can't find the little symbol for pound) for the pleasure.I read some user reviews on this book and found a few other goodreaders who felt Marco \"whitewashed\" a lot of his past in this book. I agree. Rather than being apologetic about some of his past offenses he would say he did what he did out of a commitment to the food and a drive for perfection. His ego jumps off the page at times, but considering he's the youngest chef ever to earn three Michelin stars (an accomplishment that still stands), and the first Briton ever to do so, I'd say he's earned some bragging rights."}, {"userName": "Jill", "userReviewDate": "Dec 19, 2008", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/291844-jill", "userReview": "Anthony Bourdain's Kitchen Confidential - a behind the scenes look into a chef's life - was what got me hooked on food literature. Although Bourdain and White are different in many ways (White's a three starred Michelin chef and he stresses that he never did drugs nor did he binge on alcohol), the Devil in the Kitchen reminded me of Bourdain's book in many ways: the hard scrabble to the top, their accounts of verbal exchanges in the kitchen with the liberal use of foul language, and ultimately, their passion for food and addiction to the adrenalin rush that comes with working constantly under pressure that kept them in the business for so long. But the Devil in the Kitchen makes for a much better read for several reasons: Bourdain's raw, gritty, take-it-or-leave style can be jarring at times. By contrast, the Devil in the Kitchen is less abrasive. Also, it was fascinating to learn of White's connections to chefs like Mario Batali, Heston Blumenthal and Gordon Ramsay."}, {"userName": "Firecooked", "userReviewDate": "Mar 12, 2008", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/750682-firecooked", "userReview": "Ok, second book in a row that I was just glad to get to then end!

There is nothing worse than getting a celebrity biography/memoir and there is little of interest in it or all the secrets or scandals are ignored or glossed over. It kind of defeats the purpose. Well you can't accuse Marco of any of that. He tells the reader exactly how things were and isn't worried about altering things to make himself look better. He is happy to tell the stories that make him look like a psycho which does make it entertaining. It also gives you an idea of what kind of extreme lifestyle it is to be a successful chef. My favourite bit was where Marco was talking about Oliver Reed being a regular customer who was well liked by staff and other customers. As Marco rushed through the place one night during service, he realised that Olly was running behind him. Marco pauses, wondering why Olly needs to talk to him so urgently and Olly replies that he thought Marco was heading to a fight and was coming to help!

Throughout the book, it becomes clear that this has, and continues to have a significant impact on him. While at points, he does gloss over some less savoury moments in his life, for the most part, MPW is pretty upfront about his own bad behaviour, and although at times he explains, he doesn't often excuse it.

I think a proper biographer, and not the subject, would have a far more equitable, and interesting, story to tell."}, {"userName": "Juliet Slemming", "userReviewDate": "Feb 16, 2012", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/6477066-juliet-slemming", "userReview": "I was hoping for more \"Kitchen Confidential\".. this was allll about the three stars Marco has won, did I mention he has three stars? if he mentioned it once he mentioned it 100 times... how many stars? 3 I think.

Ever wanted to know what you can achieve by hard work and passion? How about the youngest ever 3 Michelin Star holder and First Ever British 3 Michelin Star Chef. The almost rock star status he had achieved by his late twenties is all the more amazing when you consider. He grew up on a council estate in Leeds, his mother died when he was 6 and his father worked all hours to keep the family together.This is the story of how he did it, warts and all. After all Marco was also famous as the foul mouthed bully of the kitchen. It seems to work though as many of his young chefs went onto make big names for themselves. Including the mighty Gordon Ramsey. At the time this book was written, they had fallen out big time.I hope that many years later they have reconciled, but given Marco's past record I doubt it. Anyway, a fantastic book that should make 99.9% of people run away from the thought of being a chef and should make 99% of chefs realise that really they may never be more than glorified cooks. Such were the standards he set."}, {"userName": "Antonella Montesanti", "userReviewDate": "Mar 09, 2017", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/7679429-antonella-montesanti", "userReview": "Libro autobiografico di uno chef stellato.In questo libro c'\u00e8 tutto di Marco Pierre White, dall'infanzia tribolata all'apoteosi in ambito culinario internazionale.Anzitutto personalmente cambierei l'aggettivo stellato, dalle tre stelle Michelin ottenute, a stellare.Questo personaggio \u00e8 allo stesso tempo un anarchico, un creativo, un maniacale, un genio, un enfant terrible nel vero senso della parola.Dal nulla si \u00e8 creato un impero miliardario attorno, con un duro lavoro e con un carattere a dir poco difficile e irascibile, a volte a discapito della vita affettiva, lasciata sempre in secondo piano fino all'abbandono della scena in modo quasi plateale.Premetto che non ho mai guardato programmi di cucina molto in voga ai giorni nostri, questo libro ha saputo rapirmi dall'inizio alla fine, mi ha fatto capire che per l'autore la cucina creativa \u00e8 affascinante e paragonabile sicuramente ad una delle pi\u00f9 belle lettere d'amore."}, {"userName": "Darnell Kebo", "userReviewDate": "Nov 13, 2017", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/31449127-darnell-kebo", "userReview": "The Devil in the Kitchen was quite an enjoyable read. It's format takes you through Marco's journey to becoming a celebrated chef. The writing makes is easy to see his trials and tribulations, however, I felt that it really lacked depth. It was a great read to understand the process of what he went through but you don't really get a thorough grasp of any of his relationships and there are many he mentions. Some are fleeting in passing and some are described with a bit more detail. There are lots of stories and experiences he shares about being in the kitchen. You get a thorough understanding of his strong desire to provide excellent dishes and his drive to be the best.The title seems a bit off. There isn't much discussion about sex nor his intimate relationships in very much detail at all. Pain and madness - yes there's lots of that."}, {"userName": "Helen Cargile", "userReviewDate": "Jan 03, 2018", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/22983196-helen-cargile", "userReview": "I worked as a hotel food and beverage director. I can tell you from firsthand experience that chef\u2019s are all very temperamental. The high stress of a busy commercial kitchen could break anyone. Chef\u2019s can be lovable and happy one minute then ready to kill someone in the blink of an eye. This book fully exposes what working in a commercial kitchen is like in no uncertain terms. Because they work so hard chef\u2019s can be prone to excess in their down time- also conveyed very well by the author. He tells his own story with candor, no sugar coating at all. I\u2019ll read more by the chef/celebrity/author."}], "description": "What do Mario Batali, Heston Blumenthal, and Gordon Ramsay have in common? Answer: They all survived tours of duty in the kitchen of Marco Pierre White. In the UK, White's brilliant cooking and high-wattage antics have made him a legend: the first British chef (and the youngest chef anywhere) to win three Michelin stars, a chain-smoking, pot-throwing, multiply married culinary genius whose fierce devotion to food and restaurants has been the only constant in a life of tabloid-ready turmoil. In The Devil in the Kitchen, he tells the story of his life in food, spanning his apprenticeship with Albert and Michel Roux, his wild years in the bacchanal of 1980s Chelsea, his ferocious pursuit of the highest Michelin rating, and his \"retirement career\" as a hugely successful restaurateur. With cameos from the likes of Michael Caine, Madonna, and Damien Hirst, The Devil in the Kitchen leaves no dish unserved, relating the backroom antics, the blood feuds, and the passion for great food that have driven London's greatest restaurants for decades.", "title": "The Devil in the Kitchen: Sex, Pain, Madness and the Making of a Great Chef", "url": "http://www.goodreads.com/book/show/69435.The_Devil_in_the_Kitchen", "average": 3.88, "cover": "https://images.gr-assets.com/books/1441581613l/69435.jpg", "reviews": 245, "authors": [{"url": "https://www.goodreads.com/author/show/39091.Marco_Pierre_White", "name": "Marco Pierre White"}, {"url": "https://www.goodreads.com/author/show/472285.James_Steen", "name": "James Steen"}], "type": ["Food and Drink", "Nonfiction", "Biography", "Autobiography", "Food and Drink"], "outlinks": ["http://www.goodreads.com/book/show/69435.The_Devil_in_the_Kitchen", "http://www.goodreads.com/book/show/2099553.The_Devil_in_the_Kitchen", "http://www.goodreads.com/book/show/1758548.The_Devil_In_The_Kitchen", "http://www.goodreads.com/book/show/9443556-the-devil-in-the-kitchen", "http://www.goodreads.com/book/show/12169317-the-devil-in-the-kitchen", "http://www.goodreads.com/book/show/1047254.White_Slave", "http://www.goodreads.com/book/show/19761557-the-devil-in-the-kitchen", "http://www.goodreads.com/book/show/1859467.White_Heat", "http://www.goodreads.com/book/show/22875645-white-heat-25", "http://www.goodreads.com/book/show/5723290-marco-pierre-white-s-great-british-feast", "http://www.goodreads.com/book/show/22008586-white-slave", "http://www.goodreads.com/book/show/1964349.Wild_Food_From_Land_And_Sea", "http://www.goodreads.com/book/show/16498123-a-guide-to-the-present-moment", "http://www.goodreads.com/book/show/40198297-hunting-eichmann", "http://www.goodreads.com/book/show/40193094-the-breaks-of-the-game", "http://www.goodreads.com/book/show/5312677-celebration-of-discipline", "http://www.goodreads.com/book/show/40243434-soul-keeping", "http://www.goodreads.com/book/show/22561514-the-autobiography-of-eleanor-roosevelt", "http://www.goodreads.com/book/show/31391295-how-to-be-a-bawse", "http://www.goodreads.com/book/show/8143199-how-remarkable-women-lead", "http://www.goodreads.com/book/show/5440602-how-soccer-explains-the-world", "http://www.goodreads.com/book/show/40193421-dry", "http://www.goodreads.com/book/show/40204948-a-truck-full-of-money", "http://www.goodreads.com/book/show/40229444-animal-liberation", "http://www.goodreads.com/book/show/19485478-a-woman-in-charge", "http://www.goodreads.com/book/show/38272015-the-measure-of-a-man", "http://www.goodreads.com/book/show/40203910-32-yolks", "http://www.goodreads.com/book/show/40193675-recovery", "http://www.goodreads.com/book/show/18880380-enemies", "http://www.goodreads.com/book/show/36693639-victoria", "http://www.goodreads.com/book/show/40203983-being-nixon", "http://www.goodreads.com/book/show/20960501-100-days-of-real-food", "http://www.goodreads.com/book/show/40268935-barbarians-at-the-gate", "http://www.goodreads.com/book/show/26064021-things-no-one-will-tell-fat-girls", "http://www.goodreads.com/book/show/29465033-whipping-girl", "http://www.goodreads.com/book/show/19730030-a-history-of-warfare", "http://www.goodreads.com/book/show/22844509-best-friends", "http://www.goodreads.com/book/show/18939110-let-it-go", "http://www.goodreads.com/book/show/40192801-future-crimes", "http://www.goodreads.com/book/show/13576617-still", "http://www.goodreads.com/book/show/35525893-sick-in-the-head", "http://www.goodreads.com/book/show/40205119-paris-1919"]}
