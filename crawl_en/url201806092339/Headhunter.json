It is perhaps as unsettling a book as I am willing to read, and yet, I've read it three or four times now. It keeps drawing me back, for all its horror.Note: The rest of this review has been withdrawn due to the changes in Goodreads policy and enforcement.

Headhunter is an inventive and possibly even brilliant re-telling of Heart of Darkness, set in Toronto at the Parkin Institute -- a thinly-veiled Clarke Institute of Psychiatry -- with Kurtz (yes, really) re-cast as the Parkin`s head psychiatrist, who has gone wayyyyyy up the river and over the edge into madness himself if not pure evil, and Marlow (yup) his alter ego, a fellow psychiatrist who functions as rational observer-saviour-hero. Look for all the dark-light symbolism that surrounds these two; perhaps a bit heavy-handed, but no less effective for it. The dystopian city and society Findley portrays - from its government cover-up and mass-scale extermination of starlings claimed to be causing the plague afflicting the city; to its raw portrayal of child pornography, incest and paedophilia (and those who are drawn to it, and why; we get a real insider`s look here) set amid the moneyed-artsy class of Toronto - has left me feeling unsettled and slightly nauseated. Findley is a fabulous writer, and probably not read as widely as he should be. His books tend to sprawl, and be about everything at once - they have huge scope. This one was in danger of heading off in too many directions, but he`s such a good story-teller, you forgive him what might be some of his excesses. Lilah is a wonderful, heart-rending and sympathetic character. You just want to take her in your arms and comfort her, tell her everything is going to be alright. You`d be lying, of course, but this book explores THAT as much as anything (and everything) else: that part of the human heart, the lightness, the capacity to love, and to have hope set against the opposite: the dark corruption, manipulation and brutality. Even through the horror (the horror), it kept me reading - fascinated by the characters, swept up in the breadth of Findley`s vision and the sheer inventiveness of it - but also, unable to look away, even though so much of this was truly appalling to think about. Equal parts dystopian social commentary, murder mystery and ghost story, at its heart (yes, I did just go there), it`s an exploration of the human capacity for evil. Plus, there`s some snide satire of the obnoxious Rosedale plastic-surgery loving elite (the Torontonians in the crowd will love this - unless you live in Rosedale, I guess), and a great, heroic dog named Grendel.Lots to love."}, {"userName": "Wendy Baxter", "userReviewDate": "Mar 12, 2008", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/777267-wendy-baxter", "userReview": "Definitely not recommended to my students. But my favourite of his books. Is that a terrible thing to say? It's kind of a terrible book. I mean, given its topic. But it is so well written that I couldn't help admiring it.

The book was okay, the material covered was reasonably portrayed but rather disturbing, but all in all it did not engage me or keep me on the edge of my seat. I had been recommended this book by someone who said that Timothy Findley is a similar author to Robertson Davies... I failed to feel the connection. Perhaps if I were to read some other books by Findley I might see the similarities but for now this book has turned me off of reading any additional Findley for a while."}, {"userName": "Heather", "userReviewDate": "Jun 19, 2014", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/28363483-heather", "userReview": "\u201cHeadhunter,\u201d is placed somewhere in the near future. Too close for comfort, I would say as this social dystopian novel looks at two elements; 1. species extinction as hallmarks for environmental collapse almost as closely as it examines the background behind 2. child pornography. (It asks the questions we find hard to ask as a community \u2013 what is the difference between deliberate apathy and obedience by likening the turning of a blind eye towards the bird pandemic and when society ignored the first signposts of AIDS.) These two elements are the axis of \u2018evils,\u2019 that collude and conspire within this Torontonian futuristic setting. Kurtz and Marlowe are brought forward from the, \u2018Heart of Darkness,' to play their roles of evil vs. good. Birds and children symbolize innocence and in a sense, Findley is commenting on the loss of innocence. Secondary characters reveal added dimensions to the overall plot by pushing at the boundaries of madness, which beg questions. When does madness become evil? I am not a fan of early \u2018reveal,\u2019 of the nemesis or antagonist as it surely predicts the necessity of doing away with this character in some manner. Still Findley\u2019s writing is one that commands attention and places it within a 360 degree arena/stage, where detail is perfectly wrought and balanced with succinctness. Now that I have discovered what Findley\u2019s elusive style of writing was, I can bump up my previous ratings of his works with greater confidence. What a perfect balanced writing style Findley had and what a loss to Canadian culture. I have finally encountered Timothy Findley\u2019s writing and I am looking forward to reading more of his works. 4.5"}, {"userName": "CynthiaA", "userReviewDate": "Jan 22, 2011", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/1501865-cynthiaa", "userReview": "Findlay is brilliant, but this wasn't one of my faves of his. Nonetheless, I enjoyed it. The parallels between this book and Heart of Darkness were fascinating. The discussion of 'madness' was interesting as well. The part I struggled with was the extremely disturbing sexual behaviours of some of the characters. I realize that to explore a theme of 'sex as power' these character's behaviours were necessary to the book, but it was just too edgy for me in some places.I found the ending to be a bit weak. Anti-climactic almost. I think that is because I wanted punishment and there wasn't any. Or at least one that I felt was suitable to the crimes committed.Still... some brilliant reflections and passages, and fodder for some deep social discussion."}, {"userName": "Claire", "userReviewDate": "Mar 19, 2007", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/31666-claire", "userReview": "Ok, so it's wierd and pretty graphic...I still loved it!

Wealth and power minus souls or empathy for the human race. The protagonist and antagonist in this book share the famous names of former fictional characters: Kurtz and Marlow a la Joseph Conrad's \"Heart of Darkness\". Their relationship is much the same as the originals. A bird-flu disease, psychiatric hospitals and patients, halluncinated fictional literary characters and The Club of Men.

She does not figure as prominently as expected. The book explores some interesting territory, particularly if you're able to recognize the literary references (not sure if I got them all). However, the book also explores some very horrible material, of a disturbing and sexual nature (abuse of power, sexual violence, pedophilia, etc.). I'm not sure that the interesting makes up for the disgusting. I enjoy Timothy Findley up to a point, but his books always seem to take a detour into sexual horror."}, {"userName": "Claire", "userReviewDate": "Oct 23, 2012", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/2880300-claire", "userReview": "I did find the first half of the book focused on the weathly Club of Men characters and associates very dry reading that I had to push through. Very dark. Never visits why such club members would desire such darkness. Just giving permission. The desire for power. Scary. Terrifying. Timothy writes about very complex ideas and dark natures. And there is no hope. Just acceptance and the right to survive. But no light or renewal. Horrible. There was indication of some change. The baby. The three sisters move forward.
