I can't explain this strange relationship I have with her characters. They are my guilty pleasure. More than the love plots (which usually involve infidelity, hmmm) and more than the character development, or lack of....it's her writing style. I love her cadence, her rythmn, and her emotional connections. One of my favorites is Fortune's Rock, which is a twisted sort of love story. But I couldn't put it down. Maybe because the book was set on the water, which is an immediate draw for me. Anyway, I will happily keep reading my Shreve books, rating them just 3 stars, asking myself why?, and then rejoicing in the fact that I'm an adult now.

Anita Shreve writes with skill, although I could have done without quite as much description of what people are wearing - especially since they change their clothes at least twice a day. But she captures the scene of a WASPy New England family summering on the coast of New Hampshire perfectly.[return]But by the last third, I started wondering whether she knew quite where she was trying to go with the development of Sydney and the course of her life, and the end felt a bit loose.[return]I often find it difficult to enjoy books that are so focused on the emotions of their characters, because they seem somewhat false to me, but that is one problem I did not encounter here. Shreve nails the emotions in every situation, for every character, and it all feels just right. I didn't love the plot and felt the end was weak, but all the same this was an enjoyable read, and not as light as I had expected."}, {"userName": "Margaret", "userReviewDate": "Aug 13, 2013", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/4110125-margaret", "userReview": "Warning! Stay out of the water. It's not safe to go Body Surfing!I've read several Anita Shreve books (Fortune's Rocks, Pilot's Wife, The Last Time They Met) none of which I call stellar but all much better than this one.Sydner Sklar finds herself once widowed and once divorced in her late twenties. She drops out of grad school and takes a summer job as a live in tutor for the Edwards family who live on the idyllic New Hampshire shore. (And who live in the same house that pops up in many Shreve books.) While tutoring 18-year old Julie, Sydney aimlessly drifts into the vortex of this dysfunctional family. Right out of Harlequin, she is attracted to both of the older brothers Ben and Jeff, she is shunned by their cold, resentful mother, and she adores the noble father.Warning. I am about to spoil the plot, if you can actually call it a plot.Over one fateful night, our heroine ends up in a romance with Jeff which drives a wedge between the brothers. Despite a less than compelling relationship, Sydney and Jeff move in together and get engaged. Eleven months later, Jeff dumps her at the altar when he admits to himself and to her that the reason he is with her is because he didn't want his brother Ben to have her. As it turns out, this isn't the first time Jeff has pulled such a stunt in competition with his brother. Jeff heads off to Africa. Sydney loafs around Boston to recover from the shock. She ends up back at the beach several years later and runs into Ben and they end up body surfing naked at night. How stupid.Why am I bothering to write so much about a book I disliked so? Good question. I'll eek a few more words on my 3 biggest gripes.1. The writing style. The first 18 pages is mostly incomplete sentences. I cannot figure out why this writer chose that style. It was hard to immerse myself in the story when it felt like I was skimming along the tops of choppy waves in a high powered speed boat. Not a fun ride.2. Sydney was milk toast. She was a completely bland character that I didn't understand, like, relate to, or even want to spend time with.3. Outlandish plot lines - There are great works of fiction with completely implausible plot lines. This is not one of them. She ends up naked on the beach with the brother of the man who left her at the altar. Whatever!Rating - 1 out of 5 stars.

I didn't care about the characters, which weren't well developed, and the main character keeps making the same mistakes again and again and doesn't seem all that smart. I had to force myself to finish it. The final section seemed to have promise because I expected to see the main character in a good light, but she just went back to where she started. The passive voice is not avoided by Anita Shreve. I kept getting irritated at that, as well as her continuous descriptions of clothes, jewelry, hair, food, etc. (OK, OK, the wedding dress was salmon colored. You don't have to constantly remind the reader of its color.) At times it felt like she was just trying to fill space. The book's structure was distracting as well. She put space breaks everywhere, breaking chapters into a zillion little sections, even putting breaks in the middle of scenes and in the middle of dialogue. I didn't understand what she was trying to do with that.Overall, this felt like a romance novel; it was all about trying to find the right man. The main character even flirted with a man days after her fiance left her at the altar.

My mom told me there were some pretty big twists, all which I predicted (which is disappointing-I love to be surprised!). She didn't develop the characters as well as I would have liked. Why did Mrs. Edwards hate her so much? You can read into the fact that she and Mr Edwards really grew on each other and had a great relationship, but I would have liked to have seen deeper conversations between the 2 of them-then, how she treated him when she moved on, so frustrating! I get why she moved on, but I was disappointed how she just wrote off the entire family....... She could have done a much better job with character description-not too much depth. But, over all, a good read over the Christmas season when I have to put down and pick up numerous times throughout a 4 day period!

I read her first novel, Eden Close back in the 70s when it first came out and remember really liking it. Her novel The Pilot\u2019s Wife was an Oprah pick and, thus, huge. But I\u2019m partial to the quieter novels: Where or When, The Last Time They Met.Body Surfing is the story of Sydney, a once-divorced, once-widowed woman who comes to live on the New Hampshire coast to tutor the beautiful but intellectually challenged Julie, youngest daughter of icy matriarch Mrs. Edwards and kind architect, Mr. Edwards. Her summer at the seashore is disrupted by the arrival of Julie\u2019s older brothers, Ben and Jeff. Soon, Sydney is caught in the undertow of the strange and antagonistic relationship between the brothers.I found the novel odd and oddly compelling. Shreve unfurls Sydney\u2019s story in short elliptical passages, layering Sydney\u2019s day-to-day routine with memories of her divorce and dead husband. It\u2019s hard to say what she is searching for because most of the time she isn\u2019t even aware of it. Perhaps she is looking for family \u2013 but the Edwards' family have issues of their own despite the appearance of perfection. Whatever she is looking for, it is complicated and there aren\u2019t any easy answers.Shreve is a good writer, but I wouldn\u2019t say that Body Surfing is her best book.

Anita Shreve chooses each word carefully and I was drawn into the world she created in this story.The novel takes place in an oceanfront cottage in New Hampshire. A well to do family has gathered for their summer vacation and Sydney is hired as a tutor to their 18 year old daughter who has special needs. A love triangle emerges as two older brothers in the family compete for Sydney's love and attention. There are a number of twists and turns in the story which made it interesting to read.\"Body Surfing\" will be particularly enjoyed by anyone who loves the beach. The main characters enjoy \"body surfing\" for enjoyment. The beach is my favorite place to be and it was obvious to me in reading this book that Anita Shreve shares my love for the ocean and the beach. The author describes the beach so well - I felt like I was right there each time I picked up the book.This book would be a great \"beach read\" or a good read on a cold day when you long for the beach!I have enjoyed all the other books I have read by Anita Shreve.

A more thorough review coming up! Whew! If only I could write book reviews as fast as I can finish reading books.******************REVIEW UPDATE:I have read two of Anita Shreve\u2019s novels, the first one was The Pilot\u2019s Wife, the story of which I can vaguely remember except that the rating I gave it on Goodreads was 4 stars, which means that I might have fairly enjoyed it. Then I keep seeing some of her books on my favorite bookshop, Booksale, and I cannot just resist not buying them. Who can resist low priced books, anyway? Body Surfing is a story about twenty-nine year old Sydney, a detail that might have partly affected my decision to buy the book because she was my age, plus that it was on sale at the National Bookstore for only Php 50!The story spans for three years \u2013 from 2002 up to 2005 \u2013 and it is during these years that Sydney finds herself in a roller coaster of emotions and existence brought about by loving and caring. Anita Shreve captures every emotion accurately except that I find Sydney\u2019s grief to be a little bit unconvincing. Or maybe it is just Shreve\u2019s way of leaving the thinking to her readers?Body Surfing is not an excellent read, but not entirely a bad read, either. It\u2019s good company at airports and ferries, not so heavy on the brain cells and not so dense to be altogether boring and uninteresting. The writing is fluid and the style is easy and uncomplicated. The plots are not necessarily original but altogether interesting and captivating. The characters are readable and possessed just the right amount of mystery to make the story not too predictable. It contains enough pace to excite the reader towards the twist and the ending without necessarily making the reader skip some pages.

Sydney is hired to be the tutor for their \"slow\" daughter, Julie, while Mr. Edwards is an architect who enjoys his rose garden and collects historical documents on the house they're living in. It is the same house that was featured in several other Shreve novels, like \"The Pilot's Wife\". Mrs. Edwards strikes me as a snob and a bit of a racist with her remarks about Sydney being half-Jewish. The brothers, Ben and Jeff, who arrive a little later in the novel are the catalysts to a big change in Sydney's life. Sydney is 29, divorced once and widowed once. She is floating through life, not sure what to do or where to go. She accepts the job as a tutor for the summer and builds a good relationship with Julie even discovering her artistic flair. In the midst of this summer she falls for one of the brother's and a relationship begins, rather suddenly. The whole story is based on this relationship and its outcome. I enjoyed the clean writing and the lack of overdescriptive paragraphs that tend to drive me crazy in some novels. I like to be able to picture the characters in my own way. Having said that, I would have liked a little more background or information on some of the characters, most notably the two brothers. I think we could have used a bit more fleshing out of their characters. I still do not completely understand why Jeff acted the way he did. There are so many internal struggles going on with this family that each character is a story unto themselves. Also, I had hoped for more of an ending but I guess I will have to make some assumptions as to Sydney's future life.

It's not a very common occurrence, but it is the main character of this book - Sydney's reality. This is the stage of her life in which she finds herself when she goes to work for the Edwards family. Ostensibly to tutor their teenage daughter, Julie, so that she can pass and do well on her upcoming SAT's, Sydney goes to stay with the Edwards at their beach house in New Hampshire. There, she body surfs, meets the Edwards' two sons Ben and Jeff, and begins to live again. As she opens Julie's eyes to her future, to love, Sydney once more opens her own heart and falls in love with Jeff. But then, on the night of her wedding, she learns an hideous truth, sending her life into yet another downward spiral.The interesting thing about this book is, just as Sydney is lied to, so are we as readers. I was none the wiser towards the truth than she was, and, though, in the back of mind, I suspected that something might be wrong, I never thought it was what was eventually revealed. It was heartbreaking and devastating, though my pain, of course, was minor compared to what the character experienced.At the same time, Julie runs away from home, the Edwards brothers get into a fight and never find their way out of it, Sydney forms a close relationship with her future father-in-law, and Mrs. Edwards never once thaws towards her employee/future daughter-in-law. While Sydney is undoubtedly the main character, as a whole, this book is a family drama, exploring all the various relationships one finds present in a nuclear family, making it extremely relatable. Also, due to the fact that it is written in the present tense, there is a sense of 'now' to the story, of the audience, as readers, being present. Though somewhat unconventional, it makes the story stand out.My only complaint about Body Surfing has to deal with the ending. The characters were extremely compelling - all rich and real, and the plot was character driven, my favorite. However, with this praise being said, the ending was abrupt. Though poignant and a fitting close, I also felt as though the story was left unfinished, but perhaps that was the point. Because this book was more of a character study, maybe it was just a brief glimpse into these people's lives and, once it was over, we were to realize that they would continue... even if the novel didn't. Whether this was the case or not, though, I wouldn't have complained if the author - Anita Shreve - would have offered her readers just a little bit more to wrap the tale up.Read more: http://miss-sbooks.livejournal.com/"}, {"userName": "Lynley", "userReviewDate": "Jun 05, 2011", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/4278829-lynley", "userReview": "I didn't warm to the main character, partly because I couldn't understand why she didn't work things out earlier - because I did. Stupidity never endears me to a character. Perhaps Sydney's attention was distracted by her manic vigilance - she notices clothes, how someone breathes, the details of a room and she even deduces what other characters are probably thinking. Whether she is right - another matter entirely. I'm inclined to think a character as naive as this one makes for a fairly unreliable narrator. Perhaps it would have been a more satisfying choice had Shreve decided to write from a more omniscient point of view. Instead, everything is filtered through Sydney's interpretation. Characters who obsess over what others are wearing come across as shallow to me, and led me to wonder if other people actually notice such details more readily than I do. (I think some do, some don't.)I listened to the audio book, which means I wasn't bothered by the short paragraphs others have mentioned, but it still felt choppy and I wondered at times if I had skipped a chapter, or zoned out, as can happen so easily with an audio book. But I don't think this was the case. The narrator did that really annoying thing whereby she changed her voice to emulate character voices, but for me it NEVER works when a woman attempts a male voice, or when a male attempts a female voice. I wish this wouldn't happen in audio books - instead, if voices are going to change, I prefer radio plays, which make use of completely different people. I'm not sure if this is a personal preference or if it's shared by many. But the narrator's voicing of Ben and Jeff resulted in a low, guttural, unnatural sound used by men who think they're hot stuff, and this didn't endear me to the men either. The characters of the mother and Victoria were voiced in a 'posh' voice, which I thought was overdoing it, because the listener can tell the characters of these women simply by what they do.I did really enjoy The Pilot's Wife some time ago, but I didn't enjoy this story nearly so much."}, {"userName": "Debbie", "userReviewDate": "Dec 09, 2012", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/5276322-debbie", "userReview": "This is one I wish that there was an option for a half star. I\u2019d give this book 3 \u00bd stars. This will be a brief review. This was an ok book. Anita Shreve is a talented descriptive writer. She paints a good picture of the atmosphere, the setting and the details of her characters. This is a kind of love story. A kind of story about family. I don't want to give much detail away because that's all there is. To be honest this review is hard for me because though the writing was good and once the story was finally clear it was good but it took so long to start. It seemed as if the scene was being set for the entire first half of the book. A plot didn\u2019t make itself evident until the second half of the book, at which point it seemed to explode and then die down again. It was strange. I was almost to the point of putting the book down, until I reached that second half and something happened. I thought, ok, this is getting good now but then the third section of the book was strangely disconnected. Some parts were kind of out of left field and I wondered what it had to do with the story as a whole. It ended with a \u201creally, so it\u2019s like that??\u201d type of feel as well. I mean, over all being finished with the book I can look back with an overview and think, ok, I see what the author\u2019s intension was but it really was a little disjointed. I don\u2019t like meeting characters who have nothing to do with the story at hand. Maybe it was a little bit overly descriptive. Looking beyond its faults I\u2019m giving the descriptive writing and the overview the 3 \u00bd stars. Would I recommend it?

And the author's way of writing it kind of different to me, and I had a hard time getting in the swing of things with it (the inside cover says \"...written in language both true and spare...\"). Spare is a good way to describe it, and each paragraph was separated by two line spaces, and it was like there was information missing between the paragraphs (I'm sure I'm not explaining this well).

In my opinion, there was very little character development and I felt very little attachment to the characters. It was like Shreve just expected you to take her words for face value - ie: saying something along the lines of \"she really loved him\" and expect you to feel it without the actions to back the words. The ending was very open-ended, leaving the reader to imagine what happens next. Perhaps so Shreve can write a sequel? After reading through the book, struggling to attach to the characters and writing style, I would have hoped to be rewarded with a better ending.Despite all of this, I did enjoy reading the book because it was quick and mindless, and just what I needed. This was my first Shreve book. I will try one more before making a determination about her. 3-1/2 stars."}, {"userName": "Dee", "userReviewDate": "Jul 28, 2011", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/2177726-dee", "userReview": "more like one and a half...if it hadn't been a challenge book I probably would have DNF'd it...thankfully, it only cost me $4 on the hardback sale shelf at borders vice full prince...I had many issues with it - the first being that there was wayyy to much about the authors political views showing through...I really hate it when I start to read a book and there is a section complaining about a certain section or person in the government...it seemed obvious that she also hadn't done a lot of research about certain aspects. While some might think its not a big deal, there is one part where she makes the statement about someone deciding the run the Boston marathon on a whim (umm, yeah, right...its a competative race to get into and you have to have a certain time in a previous marathon to qualify) and then like 15 pages later, she makes a comment that the same person is barely a runner...say huh?? did I miss something somewhere...aside from that, the prose just seemed really awkwardly written like it jumped back and forth between first and third person...a good editor was definately needed...this was my first by Ms Shreve and it will probably be my last"}, {"userName": "Jennefer", "userReviewDate": "May 12, 2010", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/3199532-jennefer", "userReview": "This is the first book I have read by Anita Shreve and I have to say I am very disappointed in this author. Some of the users of shelfari rated Shreve right up there with Jodi Picoult and that is why I borrowed this novel from a friend in the first place. Shreve doesn't compare at ALL to the likes of Picoult!! First of all ,the writing style in this novel is extremely choppy and distracting. Second, the characters are never fully explained and or developed. I never really felt any emotion from this author. I found it odd that she could be really descriptive about something but never fully explain what was going on. I felt like she was writing an essay and needed to meet a quota of \"words used\" instead of writing a well thought-out novel. In other words she had this annoying way of describing things using to many words but never really saying what needed to be said. It was tortuous to continue to read this novel but I didn't want to be a quitter so I continued. Don't bother with this book it was a complete waste of time! Not enjoyable at all! I really don't want to give up on this author but I just don't know if I can try again with one of her books!"}, {"userName": "Erin Rogers", "userReviewDate": "May 08, 2012", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/4043254-erin-rogers", "userReview": "Meh. Full discloser: I have never read a single other Anita Shreve book, and so I don't have the love for her as an author that so many other goodreaders seem to share. My first experience with her work was just okay. I saw the description \"beach read\" in another review, and I think that reflects my feelings towards Body Surfing. It's a half romance-half soap opera starring the WASP-y Edwards family and set in their New England beach house. Sydney, a once-divorced, once-widowed young woman, comes to live with the Edwards Family as a tutor to the youngest daughter and finds herself enmeshed in the drama and romantically involved with one of the sons. I think I may have liked this novel more if Sydney hadn't been so passionless. She has, no doubt, survived her fair share of tragedy, but I wish she had shown a bit more spirit. She seems to just be wandering through her life and making the same mistakes over and over again. Not exactly what I'm looking for in my heroine. Still, if you see another Anita Shreve book lying by my beach towel, I would not be entirely surprised."}, {"userName": "Amainer", "userReviewDate": "Sep 12, 2010", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/2074496-amainer", "userReview": "I haven't read any Anita Shreve in a while. The first book of hers that I read was  Sea Glass  which I really enjoyed. I also enjoyed  The Weight of Water  and  Fortune's Rocks  but the rest have been somewhat of a disappointment. So I quit reading her books. I saw this book several times in the store, but never picked it up b/c books like  Resistance and All He Ever Wanted  were so disappointing. Then I saw this in our used bookstore and decided to give it a try. I'm so glad I did. This book reminded me of why I liked Anita Shreve in the first place. I like the cadence of her writing and her ability to create tension, both pleasant and unpleasant. I started this book yesterday and found myself unable to put it down. I really enjoyed Sydney, the main character, and the Edwards family, particularly the two brothers, Ben and Jeff, seemed so realistic they were almost palpable. This book has encouraged me to pick up a few other books of hers that have been sitting unread on my shelves."}], "description": "At the age of 29, Sydney has already been once divorced and once widowed. Trying to regain her footing once again, she has answered an ad to tutor the teenage daughter of a well-to-do couple as they spend a sultry summer in their oceanfront New Hampshire cottage.But when the Edwards' two grown sons, Ben and Jeff, arrive at the beach house, Sydney finds herself caught up in a destructive web of old tensions and bitter divisions. As the brothers vie for her affections, the fragile existence Sydney has rebuilt for herself is threatened. With the subtle wit, lyrical language, and brilliant insight into the human heart that has led her to be called \"an author at one with her m\u00e9tier\" (Miami Herald), Shreve weaves a novel about marriage, family, and the supreme courage that it takes to love.", "title": "Body Surfing", "url": "http://www.goodreads.com/book/show/14964.Body_Surfing", "average": 3.31, "cover": "https://images.gr-assets.com/books/1388257738l/14964.jpg", "reviews": 1706, "authors": [{"url": "https://www.goodreads.com/author/show/3530.Anita_Shreve", "name": "Anita Shreve"}], "type": ["Fiction", "Womens Fiction", "Romance", "Contemporary"], "outlinks": ["http://www.goodreads.com/book/show/14964.Body_Surfing", "http://www.goodreads.com/book/show/6295901-a-casa-na-praia", "http://www.goodreads.com/book/show/1550740.Body_Surfing", "http://www.goodreads.com/book/show/5191.The_Pilot_s_Wife", "http://www.goodreads.com/book/show/89399.Fortune_s_Rocks", "http://www.goodreads.com/book/show/14965.Light_on_Snow", "http://www.goodreads.com/book/show/228534.The_Weight_of_Water", "http://www.goodreads.com/book/show/3121162-testimony", "http://www.goodreads.com/book/show/39928984-mercy-among-the-children", "http://www.goodreads.com/book/show/20620995-take-me-with-you", "http://www.goodreads.com/book/show/6565401-five-quarters-of-the-orange", "http://www.goodreads.com/book/show/25600623-the-diver-s-clothes-lie-empty", "http://www.goodreads.com/book/show/18867378-the-traveler-s-gift", "http://www.goodreads.com/book/show/40198373-big-stone-gap", "http://www.goodreads.com/book/show/40198387-friendship-bread", "http://www.goodreads.com/book/show/40193401-the-little-giant-of-aberdeen-county", "http://www.goodreads.com/book/show/35963775-her-sister-s-shoes", "http://www.goodreads.com/book/show/22617980-the-rock-harbor-collection", "http://www.goodreads.com/book/show/35269080-a-thousand-tomorrows", "http://www.goodreads.com/book/show/40204902-caravans", "http://www.goodreads.com/book/show/31192689-shoeless-joe", "http://www.goodreads.com/book/show/40204877-a-hero-of-france", "http://www.goodreads.com/book/show/6473113-death-in-venice", "http://www.goodreads.com/book/show/40266651-the-tilted-world", "http://www.goodreads.com/book/show/33117501-blonde", "http://www.goodreads.com/book/show/36546758-ever-after", "http://www.goodreads.com/book/show/40193580-rescue", "http://www.goodreads.com/book/show/22032837-the-pearl-that-broke-its-shell", "http://www.goodreads.com/book/show/36589911-the-lords-of-discipline", "http://www.goodreads.com/book/show/11963271-the-sheltering-sky", "http://www.goodreads.com/book/show/25596951-the-dressmaker-s-war", "http://www.goodreads.com/book/show/35120598-gena-finn", "http://www.goodreads.com/book/show/29550710-a-charles-martin-collection", "http://www.goodreads.com/book/show/19977229-remember-tuesday-morning", "http://www.goodreads.com/book/show/8530701-a-town-like-alice", "http://www.goodreads.com/book/show/35414455-the-other-alcott", "http://www.goodreads.com/book/show/18800554-the-scavenger-s-daughters", "http://www.goodreads.com/book/show/40205036-under-the-udala-trees", "http://www.goodreads.com/book/show/32861105-the-streets-have-no-king", "http://www.goodreads.com/book/show/39929534-the-passion", "http://www.goodreads.com/book/show/35654710-this-dark-road-to-mercy", "http://www.goodreads.com/book/show/11513574-breath-eyes-memory", "http://www.goodreads.com/book/show/21942189-the-language-of-hoofbeats", "http://www.goodreads.com/book/show/18165412-house-of-bathory", "http://www.goodreads.com/book/show/37984397-we-own-the-sky", "http://www.goodreads.com/book/show/36004055-not-perfect"]}
