I mentioned before that I was surprised that I got into these books. I have noted that most of the reviewers of these are women (no surprise). Had I not been desperate for something to listen to I would probably never have tried them. Yes they are Christian in content, but they don't get preachy. Yes we do follow Father Tim and his (new) wife and his shaggy dog, but they don't slump into soap opera. I am a Christian and these are a cut above a lot of \"so called\" Christian fiction.I'd describe it this way. There are works of Christian fiction that happen to be very good books.Then there are very good books that happen to be Christian fiction. These are, in general, the latter.Even if this doesn't seem like the kind of book you would usually read let me suggest you consider trying them."}, {"userName": "Sarah Grace", "userReviewDate": "Dec 15, 2016", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/59507807-sarah-grace", "userReview": "Lovely, as always!

It's a syrupy sweet old fashioned read which does not demand anything of the reader. Many find the series feel good, and there are some sparkles of true conflict here and there, but mostly it's about the mundane daily plight of a vicar who finds love later in life and saves people - emotionally and physically. If you like the first in the series, keep reading because you will be comforted by the characters and will want to see who is added to the \"family.\" This reads like it was made for a TV series, which I am surprised it has not been made into for PBS yet!What I like about this series is that it doesn't try to be anything it is not; that in itself makes it charming, and if you want to read a simple, feel good, clean series, then this is it."}, {"userName": "Melinda", "userReviewDate": "Jun 22, 2012", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/1661139-melinda", "userReview": "I cannot get enough of this series. After I finish each volume, I am so eager to begin the next one. Karon's eclectic Mitford characters have definitely captured my attention and I realize that I am seriously invested in what becomes of them. I admire Karon's apt ability to keep the stock characters engaging - the story lines have remained fresh and animated and the additions of new characters are lively and anticipated. I feel like I currently truly know these people.In this volume, I found Fancy Skinner and her ceaseless chatter to be fantastically believable - I have known several women during my life whose faces I could easily place in her stead, minus the over-abundantly pink wardrobe. Another fresh character is Scott Murphy; the history of why he comes to Mitford is telling and especial, a definite asset to this North Carolina community. And then there's Dooley Barlowe. There continues to be such growth with this character as her struggles to put his former piteous ways behind him and parade the skills that he is obtaining in private school. The \"ain'ts\" continue to slip in and I applaud his response of \"love ya back\".

You are such a breath of small-town fresh air! If you are unfamiliar with the Mitford Years series, you need to start at the beginning, At Home in Mitford. These books, which follow life in a sleepy North Carolina town, are told from the point of view of Father Tim, the rector of Lord's Chapel. Much like an easy chair or an old sweater, this series is a cozy delight. You'll not find arresting intrigue, high drama, or pulse-quickening action in the pages of a Mitford Years book. But that's not to say you won't find something of value.What you'll find in Mitford is a loveable town with endearing characters. With each installment, you'll feel like you're catching up with family and friends. Jan Karon says she writes \"to give readers an extended family, and to applaud the extraordinary beauty of ordinary lives.\" And she's true to her word. There may be a bigger dose of minutiae than you'll encounter in a dramatic novel, but therein lies the charm. These characters feel like ordinary people--people you'd meet in a real-life small town. And we watch their lives unfold at a steady pace. We watch them celebrate, grieve, love, laugh, and grow. And hopefully we grow a little bit with them as they learn lessons from every day life.So, if you find you need a break from whatever larger-than-life drama you might be reading and want a quiet escape to clear your mind and take a deep breath before plunging back into murder, mystery, or mayhem -- look no farther than Mitford."}, {"userName": "Janice", "userReviewDate": "May 16, 2009", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/1428024-janice", "userReview": "This is the third book in this series, and with each book I am more engaged with these characters and their stories. I have listened to the books on audio, and the reader is great at giving each different person in the story a voice that fits with the wonderful characterizations developed by the author. The setting is a small town in North Carolina, and pastor Tim Kavanaugh strives to serve all the community, whether members of his church or not; he is very much a part of their joys, sorrows, and daily lives. In this book, the pastor begins to have increasing concerns for a small area outside of town called \u201cthe creek\u201d, where poverty, drugs and violence prevail; pastor Tim feels that he is not doing enough to reach those who live at \u201cthe Creek\u201d, although he and his wife are raising a young boy from there, he has found a home for another child, and formed a relationship with Homeless Hobbs, who lives in a shack and serves soup to the others living along the creek.

But it was just way too syrupy, schmaltzy, and sentimental for me. Father Timothy Kavanaugh sounds like a nice guy; but his ministry is really a textbook recipe for severe clergy burnout. He's supposed to be a simple country parson... but in reality he's superman. And a real-life pastor wouldn't last a year doing what he does, with a smile and no complaints. I know, I know, Mitford is supposed to be a special kind of place... sort of a latter-day Mayberry, North Carolina. But after about 150 pages it started to feel like something out of an episode of The Twilight Zone... and any minute I expected Rod Serling to show up, asking to join Father Kavanaugh's church.

What will they do with the wondrous rest of their lives together? Meanwhile, they help several youngsters who are from broken homes, putting feet on their faith. Their marriage is a true partnership. Even though Father Tim is a primary character, the books are not preachy at all.

He finally met a man that will take over for him, and he and Cynthia can pursue new ideas, travel, and so forth. Dooley is doing well, and his new friend Lace is becoming an important person in their family.

The setting is a small town in North Carolina, and Father Tim Kavanaugh strives to serve all the community, whether members of his church or not; he is very much a part of their joys, sorrows, and daily lives. Father Tim feels that he is not doing enough to reach those who live at \u201cthe Creek\u201d, although he and his wife are raising a young boy from there, he has found a home for another child, and formed a relationship with Homeless Hobbs, who lives in a shack and serves soup to the others living along the creek. All of these books have brought me great joy to read"}, {"userName": "Lila Diller", "userReviewDate": "Apr 27, 2018", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/65512362-lila-diller", "userReview": "I had a hard time getting into this book. I've been plugging away through the first two in the Mitford series, and I'm wondering if there is ever going to be a plot, a single thread that ties all of these pieces together. I started this book once and put it down at the end of chapter 4. It was more than six months later that I finally came back to try it again, for a challenge in my book club to redeem a book you'd never finished. After that, it finally seemed to get more into the marriage, the interaction in the relationship, of Father Tim and Cynthia, which is what I've been waiting for ever since they met. I had already felt cheated by not getting anything about their wedding, so I was getting disgusted with all the seemingly irrelevant details of the lives of everybody else in that town. I think one of the hardest things for me in this series is that I just don't relate to Father Tim much. It's hard to care about the book when I don't really care how the main character thinks. I wanted to get more into the mind of Cynthia. This came down to a POV issue for me.(I received this book as a birthday gift. The decision to write a review, as well as the opinions expressed in it, are all my own.)"}, {"userName": "Elizabeth Castro", "userReviewDate": "Oct 22, 2017", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/43363595-elizabeth-castro", "userReview": "These High, Green Hills has been my favorite story in the Mitford Years series so far. The characters become more developed, seem to have everyday real life problems, and are less \"syrupy.\" And yes, I am addicted to this series flaws and all.One of the things I like least in this series is the occasional, out of the blue, old fashioned ethnic stereotypes that is generally not seen in today's writing. Page 170 states, \"We thought Indians were living in the cave and had scalped you or made you their slaves.\" And for the ending, I read faster and faster engrossed in the story, when it came to an abrupt and screeching halt. I actually read the ending four times seeing what I had missed. I don't understand how the story could end with Cynthia looking at a wall and thinking how it could look better. I was confused."}, {"userName": "Terry", "userReviewDate": "Jun 12, 2017", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/9760366-terry", "userReview": "We have definitely fallen in love with another series. Seems we have been introduced to many new friends in this wonderful little village. \"The Mitford Years\" is a series by Jan Karon and \"These High Green Hills\" is the third book. Absolutely delightful. The town, the people, the charm and the spirituality weaved through the whole story. It will fill your heart. Mitford would be a wonderful place to escape to as we face the challenges of our everyday life. How we would love to stroll down Main Street with Fr. Tim and Barnabas, listen to a sermon at Lord's Chapel, read one of Cynthia's children's books, listen to Dooley talk about anything or sing like an angel, dance in Miss Sadie heavenly ballroom, share breakfast at Percy's or be preached to by Absalom. Mitford seems like a perfect place to be even when dealing with difficulty and we can't wait to return."}], "description": "In These High, Green Hills we're once again in Mitford, a southern village of local characters so heartwarming and hilarious you'll wish you lived right next door. At last, Mitford's rector and lifelong bachelor, Father Tim, has married his talented and vivacious neighbor, Cynthia. Now, of course, they must face love's challenges: new sleeping arrangements for Father Tim's sofa-sized dog, Cynthia's urge to decorate the rectory Italian-villa-style, and the growing pains of the thrown-away boy who's become like a son to the rector. Add a life-changing camping trip, the arrival of the town's first policewoman, and a new computer that requires the patience of a saint, and you know you're in for another engrossing visit to Mitford -- the little town that readers everywhere love to call home.", "title": "These High, Green Hills - the Third Novel in the Bestselling Mitford Series\n      \n          (Mitford Years #3)", "url": "http://www.goodreads.com/book/show/821172.These_High_Green_Hills_the_Third_Novel_in_the_Bestselling_Mitford_Series", "average": 4.28, "cover": "https://images.gr-assets.com/books/1344618554l/821172.jpg", "reviews": 520, "authors": [{"url": "https://www.goodreads.com/author/show/40552.Jan_Karon", "name": "Jan Karon"}], "type": ["Fiction", "Christian Fiction", "Christian", "Adult Fiction"], "outlinks": ["http://www.goodreads.com/book/show/821172.These_High_Green_Hills_the_Third_Novel_in_the_Bestselling_Mitford_Series", "http://www.goodreads.com/book/show/112874.These_High_Green_Hills", "http://www.goodreads.com/book/show/16053794-these-high-green-hills", "http://www.goodreads.com/book/show/147902.These_High_Green_Hills", "http://www.goodreads.com/book/show/1280868.These_High_Green_Hills", "http://www.goodreads.com/book/show/10086313-these-high-green-hills", "http://www.goodreads.com/book/show/1818586.These_High_Green_Hills", "http://www.goodreads.com/book/show/665881.These_High_Green_Hills", "http://www.goodreads.com/book/show/71776.At_Home_in_Mitford", "http://www.goodreads.com/book/show/112872.A_Light_in_the_Window", "http://www.goodreads.com/book/show/71784.A_New_Song", "http://www.goodreads.com/book/show/78674.Out_to_Canaan", "http://www.goodreads.com/book/show/71787.In_This_Mountain"]}
