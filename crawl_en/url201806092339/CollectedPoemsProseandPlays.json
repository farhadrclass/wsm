Robert Frost is a rare exception. He frequently struggled with the implications of metaphor in his work, coming to an understanding \u201cthat all thinking...is metaphorical\u201d and, thus, a simulation of reality (Frost 720). Indeed, Frost\u2019s preoccupation with metaphor and, subsequently, simulation make his poetry and prose important manifestations of literary hyperrealism. Not only does his work illustrate the replacement of the real with a poetic \u201coperational double,\u201d it reveals the violence inherent in the process of simulation (Baudrillard 2). Reality is a state with which we cannot engage. The best we can do is simulate reality, creating an illusion of reality that is neither real nor unreal\u2014but, rather, hyperreal. Jean Baudrillard expresses this process in his essay \u201cThe Precession of Simulacra:\u201dIt is no longer a question of imitation, nor duplication, nor even parody. It is a question of substituting the signs of the real for the real, that is to say of an operation of deterring every process via its operational double, a programmatic, metastable, perfectly descriptive machine that offers all of the signs of the real and short-circuits all its vicissitudes. (2)The fundamental mode of this substitution is metaphor -- the ultimate simulacrum. To generate \u201csigns of the real\u201d one must interpret the reality being simulated. The resulting interpretation or \u201csign\u201d is immutably metaphorical, and, being such, it can only approximate the real, it can never actually be the real. Moreover, metaphor simulates perception; yet, nothing can ever be truly perceived because perception itself is necessarily metaphorical. Thus, perception, metaphor and literature can never engage with the real -- they are inextricably bound to the hyperreal. Poetry is one of the most explicit manifestations of hyperreality. Every stage of poetry is metaphorical. It is metaphorical in thought, concept, execution, and translation -- a perfect simulacrum. A poem is an \u201coperational double\u201d of reality, Baudrillard\u2019s \u201cperfectly descriptive machine,\u201d that does not just represent the real, it replaces the real. Simulation, then, is not a benign act of representation; it is a violent act of replacement, which \u201csuffices to render both [the real and the simulacrum:] artificial\u201d (Baudrillard 9).Nowhere is this violence better illustrated than in \u201cThe Road Not Taken.\u201d Frost\u2019s most famous poem simulates the poet\u2019s experiences hiking in the woods with Edward Thomas and, ultimately, replaces them. Frost reputedly revealed Edward Thomas as the inspiration for his poem in a letter to Louis Untermeyer: \u201cHe...said that it was really about his friend Edward Thomas, who when they walked together always castigated himself for not having taken another path than the one they took\u201d (128). Clearly, \u201cThe Road Not Taken\u201d is based on an actual occurrence. Yet, from the moment the original event occurs, the experience can only be recalled through simulation and, once the experience is simulated, reality is supplanted by hyperreality. Like the doppleg\u00e4nger of myth, simulation strips the real of its primacy and replaces the real with its hyperreal self. Hence, even Thomas\u2019 personal castigation \u201cfor not having taken another path\u201d is inevitably superseded by the traditional reading of \u201cThe Road Not Taken,\u201d which figures Frost\u2019s poem as a meditation on the narrator\u2019s \u201cprofound awareness of the complexity of choice\u201d (Johannes Kj\u00f8rven 58). The simulation replaces Thomas\u2019 actual reaction with the narrator\u2019s hyperreal aggrandizement of the choice made:I shall be telling this with a sighSomewhere ages and ages hence:Two roads diverged in a wood, and I\u2014I took the one less traveled by,And that has made all the difference. (16-20)Edward Thomas supposedly reprimanded himself for \u201cnot having taken another path,\u201d but the narrator of \u201cThe Road Not Taken\u201d considers the choice before he makes it, then rationalizes his choice into one \u201cthat has made all the difference.\u201d Thomas\u2019 ephemeral emotional response is nowhere to be found. It is dispelled and replaced by the very simulation it inspired -- just as is Thomas\u2019 reality. Indeed, only the most fervent biographers and scholars know that an actual event inspired \u201cThe Road Not Taken\u201d; yet, their primary concern, as with every reader of Frost\u2019s poetry, is the simulation rather than the event. If the actual event is thought of at all it is secondary to the simulation it inspired.There is still another step in simulation\u2019s aggression, however. Once an \u201coperational double\u201d replaces reality it must also precede it. As Baudrillard says, \u201cthe territory no longer precedes the map, nor does it survive it. It is...the map that precedes the territory -- precession of simulacra\u201d (1). Thomas\u2019 own engagement with \u201cThe Road Not Taken\u201d exemplifies this precession: \u201cThomas failed to understand it as a poem about himself; but insisted...to Frost that \u2018I doubt if you can get anybody to see the fun of the thing without showing them and advising them which kind of laugh they are to turn on\u2019\u201d (William Pritchard 128). Here, the precession of the \u201coperational double\u201d is exposed by Thomas\u2019 concern with the poem and its potential audience rather than the event. Although he might retain the stimuli of the original walk to add to his interpretation, he is engaging with and interpreting only the model -- the real is inaccessible. Moreover, he displays a preoccupation with the audience\u2019s reaction to \u201cThe Road Not Taken\u201d that is indifferent to their knowledge of the actual events. Indeed, the audience\u2019s understanding of Frost\u2019s \u201cfun\u201d is more important to Thomas than their understanding of his role as inspiration. All concerns with reality, therefore, are usurped by the words of the poem, conjuring myriad images and interpretations in the minds of every participant, both readers and walkers alike, making even the original moment nothing more than an interpretation.In fact, it no longer matters what the \u201creal\u201d wood or paths look like. Their simulation in \u201cThe Road Not Taken\u201d replaces \u201creality\u201d with a \u201cmetastable, perfectly descriptive machine that...short circuits all of [reality\u2019s:] vicissitudes:\u201dThen took the other, as just as fair,And having perhaps the better claim,Because it was grassy and wanted wear; Though as for that the passing thereHad worn them about the same,And both that morning equally layIn leaves no step had trodden black. (Frost 6-12)In the hyperreality of Frost\u2019s poem, the woods are always \u201cyellow,\u201d the \u201cleaves\u201d never shift on the forest floor, and the paths themselves are forever \u201cworn about the same\u201d (1). No subtle change of stimuli can ever occur. While a stimulus in a simulation can be interpreted differently, no subtle shift of a body\u2019s position, nor any change of light \u2014- the vicissitudes of reality -- can ever actually alter the stimuli. Instead, a state of metastability is achieved where the setting can only be interpreted through unchanging stimuli; thus, each interpretation only increases the stability of the poem\u2019s metaphors. Thomas\u2019 recollection of the actual event, then, is unavoidably informed and replaced by the \u201cperfectly descriptive machine\u201d of Frost\u2019s poem.Yet, potent displays of hyperrealism in Frost\u2019s poetry are not isolated to \u201cThe Road Not Taken.\u201d In some cases, Frost actually confronts Baudrillard\u2019s post-structuralism head on, conjuring metaphors that deal directly with the impossibility of reality. \u201cFor Once, Then, Something\u201d is inescapably hyperreal, consciously illustrating the process of simulation and the untouchable reality it invariably supplants:Once, when trying with chin against a well curb,I discerned, as I thought, beyond the picture,Through the picture, a something white, uncertain, Something more of the depths\u2014-and then lost it. Water came to rebuke the too clear water... (7-11) The \u201cpicture\u201d in the water is a reflection of the narrator and his world. It is a mirror image that simulates \u201cMe myself in the summer heaven godlike / Looking out of a wreath of fern and cloud puffs\u201d (5-6). Simulation, once again, reveals hyperreality through an \u201coperational double\u201d\u2014-the narrator\u2019s reflection-\u2014which usurps the reality of the model by being \u201cnot exactly like it, [but:] a bit more exact. There is never similitude, any more than there is exactitude. What is exact is already too exact\u201d (Baudrillard 107). Indeed, the simulation is both more and less than the model. The narrator is represented and replaced by a simulation, but the simulation also reflects a narrator that does not and cannot exist outside the reflection. After all, visual perception of the self is non-existent without simulation and, even then, \u201cnothing resembles itself,...like all fantasies of the exact synthesis or resurrection of the real, [the reflection:] is already no longer real, [it:] is already hyperreal\u201d (Baudrillard 108). Thus, the reality of the narrator\u2019s imagined identity, like Lacan\u2019s \u201cimaginary identity at the \u2018mirror stage\u2019 of development,\u201d disappears into the hyperreality of its \u201coperational double\u201d (Julie Rivkin and Michael Ryan 123). The hyperreal \u201cpicture\u201d of the narrator\u2019s reflection, however, obfuscates more than the reality of his identity. There is \u201csomething white, uncertain\u201d hidden in the \u201cdepths\u201d of the well, and Frost uses it to illustrate the total inaccessibility of reality:Water came to rebuke the too clear water.One drop fell from a fern, and lo, a rippleShook whatever it was lay there at bottom,Blurred it, blotted it out. (11-14)Situating this \u201csomething white, uncertain\u201d as the real, Frost subverts reality by showing that it can only be hinted at: \u201cWhat was that whiteness? Truth? A pebble of quartz?\u201d Ultimately, its reality cannot be known. The state of \u201csomething white\u201d is uncertain. It can only be seen through a lens of \u201ctoo clear water,\u201d water that is \u201cnot exactly like [water:],\u201d water that is \u201calready too exact,\u201d water that is \u201calready hyperreal.\u201d Thus, when a drop of water sends out \u201ca ripple\u201d that obscures \u201csomething white\u201d it is not an imposition of hyperreality, it is merely a reinforcement of the natural state of hyperreality that is already in place. Every perception and every shift in perception, every metaphor and every alteration in metaphor is a simulation; therefore, the \u201csomething white\u201d can never be perceived in a state of reality because the act of interpretation insures that it is already an \u201coperational double\u201d-\u2014the simulation must precede and usurp reality. Frost\u2019s fascination with the simulation of thought and metaphor appears again in his poem \u201cDirective.\u201d From beginning to end, it is a paragon of simulation. Consider the opening lines of the poem, which reveal \u201cDirective\u2019s\u201d shift to a past \u201ctime\u201d of hyperreality: \u201cBack out of all this now too much for us / Back in a time made simple by the loss / Of detail...\u201d (1-3). Here, the narrator expresses the need to escape from one state into another, to enter \u201ca time made simple;\u201d yet, to do so is to enter into a hyperreality he deliberately generates. Indeed, this new \u201ctime\u201d is merely a simulation of his own imaginings. Hence, it cannot have any reality of its own.This then raises the question: is the narrator leaving behind the real for the hyperreal? The answer is certainly not. Instead, the \u201call of this now too much for us,\u201d which the narrator seemingly rejects in favor of \u201ca time made simple,\u201d is itself hyperreal. As Baudrillard says, \u201cto simulate is to feign to have what one doesn\u2019t have\u201d and this is precisely how the narrator simulates the \u201call of this now too much for us\u201d (3). It is situated as an alternative to \u201ca time made simple.\u201d Neither alternative, however, is his to reject or supplant because the simulacra of the narrator\u2019s fancy are manifested in the \u201coperational double\u201d of a poem, which is beyond ownership. Moreover, the seemingly opposite alternatives embody the two villages that the narrator later describes as having \u201c...faded / Into each other;\u201d therefore, they are already inextricably bound together in the same simulation, comprising one hyperreality (34-35). Thus, no reality can be left behind.The hyperreality of \u201cDirective\u201d is further compounded by an increase in the sources of simulation. Unlike \u201cThe Road Not Taken\u201d and \u201cFor Once, Then, Something,\u201d it is not just the narrator\u2019s perceptions and simulacra that need to be dealt with:The road there, if you\u2019ll let a guide direct you,Who only has at heart your getting lost,May seem as if it should have been a quarry\u2014Great monolithic knees the former townLong since gave up pretense of keeping covered. (8-12)Although the \u201cguide\u201d is an element of the narrator\u2019s hyperreality, he is more than a simulacrum. He is a potentially active participant capable of summoning his own simulacra. The \u201cguide\u201d conjures the metaphor of the quarry\u2019s \u201cGreat monolithic knees\u201d and it is his misdirection that leads the reader down the \u201clost\u201d road. Thus, the narrator\u2019s power to simulate is momentarily usurped by the \u201cguide,\u201d who creates a simulacrum within a simulacrum. In addition, the narrator explicitly invites the reader to participate in the act of simulation, thereby pushing \u201cDirective\u201d even deeper into hyperreality: \u201cMake yourself up a cheering song of how / Someone\u2019s road home from work this once was\u201d (29-30). The reader is directed to create \u201coperational doubles\u201d of the road, the people and their employment\u2014-to substitute \u201cthe signs of the real for the real\u201d-\u2014to create a hyperreality in which one can become \u201clost enough to find [one:]self\u201d (Frost 36). Therefore, the narrator implicates both the reader and the \u201cguide\u201d in the process of simulation, assuring that three manifestations of hyperreality, rather than one, must be considered within \u201cDirective.\u201dFor all \u201cDirective\u2019s\u201d complexity, however, the most plentiful evidence of its hyperrealism is the abundance of straightforward simulacra. \u201cThere is a house that is no more a house / Upon a farm that is no more a farm / And in a town that is no more a town\u201d (Frost 5-7). Even though they are \u201cno more,\u201d the house, the farm and the town clearly exist. How do they exist? As simulacra conjured by the narrator. Moreover, the \u201cGlacier,\u201d the \u201cpecker fretted apple trees,\u201d \u201cthe children\u2019s house of make believe,\u201d and the \u201cdrinking goblet like the Grail\u201d are all simulations, manifestations of hyperreality that blur \u201cany distinction between the real and the imaginary\u201d (Frost 16, 28, 41, 57 / Baudrillard 3). In \u201cDirective,\u201d like much of Frost\u2019s poetry, simulations abound-\u2014and where there are simulations, there must be hyperreality. \u201cWe don\u2019t write poetry about the world, the world is poetry.\u201d People, senses, light, the most basic sensory experiences, are texts that we perceive and interpret through metaphor. All thinking, all feeling, all sensing, indeed all consciousness is necessarily metaphorical and, thus, hyperreal. Poetry, films, short stories, novels, music, all the arts, are simulations of our hyperreal state. Frost may have lacked the post-structural language necessary to name this revelation when he created his poetry, yet he was undoubtedly not an unwitting practitioner of simulation: \u201cI have wanted in late years to go further and further in making metaphor the whole of thinking. I find someone now and then to agree with me that all thinking...is metaphorical\u201d (Frost 720). If Frost had lived a little longer he would have found more than a few to agree with him. Metaphor, perception, simulation. Call it what we will it cannot be reality. Our state of being is hyperreal and Frost intuited this in his poetry. He was a post-structuralist when his contemporaries were still exploring post-modernism. He was a poet ahead of his time.WORKS CITEDBaudrillard, Jean. \u201cThe Precession of Simulacra.\u201d Simulacra and Simulation. AnnArbor: University of Michigan, 1994. 1-42.Frost, Robert.

I don't hold \"doth\" and \"lady fair\" against poets such as Shakespeare and Donne--they seem to be using their own natural language. But I can't help roll my eyes at times at the romantic poets with their classical allusions and archaic language. They write of flowers and brooks as if it came from reading dusty volumes inside by a fire. Frost writes of nature as if from observing outside in the midst of it--with greater eloquence and sharpness of detail than Thoreau. And his voice is conversational, colloquial, as if he's speaking to you as a friend. And though he died before I was born, and started publishing poems before my grandmother was born, he doesn't feel dated. At the same time, he's not obscurist or dada-ish such as many modernist poets. He's not the verse equivalent of Jackson Pollock. Frost is quoted as saying that \"\"I would sooner write free verse as play tennis with the net down.\" Conversational his poetry might be, they do have structure. He's not particularly prolific. From what I can gather from online sources, he only published about 130-odd poems in his lifetime. Compare that to the output of Emily Dickinson, along with Walt Whitman, the other American poet with a first-class world reputation--she wrote over 1,700. Each of Frost's poems is telling though and worth reading, and more varied than I expected. Yes, here you can find the familiar poems \"Mending Wall,\" \"The Road Not Traveled\" and \"Stopping by Woods on a Snowy Evening\" \"Birches\" and \"After Apple-Picking\" that fit his persona as a New England Farmer poet. But there are also works such as \"Home Burial\" and \"Death of a Hired Man\" that read like short stories--works of Flash Fiction. (Home is the place where, when you have to go there/They have to take you in.). There are very short epigrammatic works of a couple of lines such as \"Precaution.\" (I never dared be radical when young/For fear it would make me conservative when old.) There are works that treat of science and a few that deal with the political and philosophical. Particularly in retrospect after reading about his take on justice versus mercy in Milton's Paradise Lost in his letter to a friend, I found these lines in his verse play A Masque of Mercy very striking:The rich in seeing nothing but injusticeIn their impoverishment by revolutionAre right. But 'twas intentional injustice.It was their justice being mercy-crossed.The revolution Keeper's bring on Is nothing but an outbreak of mass mercy,Too long pent up in rigorous convention--A holy impulse towards redistribution. To set out to homogenize mankindSo that the cream could never rise again.And as for science, one of my favorite Frost poems was supposedly inspired by his conversation with an astronomer about the end of the world--although there are also echoes of Dante:Some say the world will end in fire,Some say in ice.From what I\u2019ve tasted of desireI hold with those who favor fire.But if it had to perish twice,I think I know enough of hateTo say that for destruction iceIs also greatAnd would suffice.There's something in the tone I just adore in this one. Irony? Whimsey? I don't know how to characterize it, except I found Frost's way at looking at so many things an unexpected pleasure in poem after poem I'd never read encountering Frost in anthologies or quoted here and there. So in content this is five stars--easily, which is why I rated it that way. Frost is a favorite poet. If I was tempted to mark the rating down, it's because I'm not sure if I had to do it over I'd buy this particular edition edited by Latham and Thompson. They say in their very brief introduction that the \"texts... are allowed to speak for themselves\" and that the \"editors have deliberately avoided making interpretations.\" Certainly Frost is very accessible, but I would have liked a little value-added--more notes on the context and background. And listing the individual poems in the Table of Contents or an index of first lines would certainly have been welcome."}, {"userName": "John", "userReviewDate": "Apr 22, 2008", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/429071-john", "userReview": "This is the perfect Frost book! What I like about this edition is that besides Frost's wonderful poetry, it also has a section of his prose. In addition, at the end of the book there is an interesting and useful chronology of the poet's life. It was interesting reading how Frost, when he was a young man, took over a school class. He had little tolerance for misbehaving students, and so he caned the worst offenders. Later on, their grudges having been well-nursed and cultivated, the \"caned\" students ganged up on Frost and beat him up.I also learned in an Paris Review interview included in the book that Frost never wrote at a desk...This beautifully bound book with acid free pages is the kind of book you want to buy and add to your permanent collection."}, {"userName": "Mark", "userReviewDate": "May 05, 2012", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/7182086-mark", "userReview": "Reading Frost is a wonder. His work has become so quoted in our culture that you'd think he'd be in danger of becoming cliche. He still transcends that. His icy scenes and wintry imagery show a mind so affixed to nature's quiet desolation; a soul-searcher firmly grounded in the soil he farms and fields he traverses, observing other lonely souls seeking shelter from frailty and encroaching infirmity. He's gruff, yet gentle; melancholic, yet stoic with a wry sense of humor. Nature inspires him, but unlike the English romantics, Wordsworth in particular, his intimations of mortality hint at darker themes (read \"Stopping by Woods on a Snowy Evening\" and it's more than just misconstrued Hallmark sentiment). What I love about Library of America's edition of Frost is their inclusion of his lectures and essays about reading, literature, and poetics. I'm fascinated by how other writers and poets reflect on their craft and the artistic problems they face creating it. You get a generous sampling of that here along with some of the most original and universal poetry, next to Whitman and Dickinson, in the American canon."}, {"userName": "S.

To immerse myself in his work and life was fortunate indeed. I came to love his poetry, and hisI suspected there was something deeper in Frost than the cursory readings of his most-loved poems. There certainly is. (I can recommend the three lectures on Frost from the 'Great Courses' course on 20th Century American literature, delivered by the inestimable Arnold Weinstein.) Something darker, more complex. His aesthetic is interesting too, as outlined in the 'prose' section of this beautiful book."}, {"userName": "Laurie", "userReviewDate": "Mar 07, 2017", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/797198-laurie", "userReview": "Had a whole class on Frost in college.

I was thrilled to recognize and remember so many of them the second time around.This volume also contains three plays by Frost -- short ones, and letters, essays, articles, lectures, and even some children's stories. His humor is so very 'down home' and in so much of his work he is the American farmer, presenting a clear view of what farming communities were like in the late-19th and early 20th centuries. I must confess that I prefer his poetry, but his essays on poetry and being a writer are necessary reading for anyone interested in writing, whether one writes for oneself alone or for publishing. His insights are beautiful, incisive and spot on. Writing is in the bones if is one is made that way. Some of us simply 'must' write. In my own case it is only because I find I get stung by a thought that I need to explain, if only to myself, and to remember. I have boxes and boxes of poems -- very bad poems, and also about seven partial novels. Obviously not writing for anyone but myself. Frost said one thing in particular that made me sit up and give an 'Alleluia.' Herewith:\"A poem begins with a lump in the throat; a home-sickness or a love-sickness. It is a reaching out toward expression; an effort to find fulfillment. A complete poem is one where an emotion has found its thought and the thought has found its words.\"Robert Frost, THE MAN AND HIS WORK, 1923. That's exactly right. The lump in the throat, a strong feeling that will not let you go until you have found the words that say exactly how you feel. I get that feeling several times a day. It's exquisite!"}, {"userName": "Keith", "userReviewDate": "Mar 09, 2011", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/4873736-keith", "userReview": "I am not attempting to read this book (with more than 900 pages) all the way through at one time. Instead I'm reading one section at a time and I'll offer my opinions on each as I read them. I will add that the Library of America edition is nice collection. I highly recommend it to anyone with a serious interest in poetry. North of Boston(1914) **** \u2013 This groundbreaking volume contains several of Frost\u2019s most famous poems including Mending Wall, The Death of the Hired Hand, and The Wood Pile. What\u2019s fascinating to me is his frequent use of dialogue in this set. Eight out of the 14 poems are dialogues between two or more people, and a few are dramatic monologues. During the height of Modernism, Frost\u2019s poems are more like playlets \u2013 mini dramas \u2013 mostly written in blank verse with some, but little, narration. (02/2014)Mountain Interval (1916)**** -- This is one of Frost's best books of poetry (not counting his anthologies). It includes many of his most famous poems including The Road Not Taken, An Old Man's Winter Night, The Oven Bird, Birches, and Out, Out, plus many other gems. It displays all of Frost's darkness and comedy. I highly recommend this selection.

His style didn't evolve much over the decades, but his poems are highly complex (they can be read on several different levels), with an unusual combination of voice and rhythm. He is a careful observer of nature, writes incredible poetic dialogue, and best of all (although this is resented by some academics), his poetry is highly accessible. The \"Collected Poems\" include everything he has written--all his poems, and two dramatic pieces (although not his aphorisms--they remain in his notebooks), and one can only marvel. Certainly they are not all great, but all are worthy of being published. Frost won the Pulitzer Prize four times, and one can see why.
