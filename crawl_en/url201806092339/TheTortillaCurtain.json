That is something of particular concern, I think, for \"socially conscious\" and environmentally minded folks. For example: a person can get way up on their soapbox about bringing reusable bags to the store, while trashing the environment by driving to the store in a gas-hog and after getting there, filling the bags with all kinds of inessential crap (most likely: made in China! literally, as we put the stuff in our shopping bag, we can be overheard, criticizing the Chinese for being big polluters, but the factories doing the polluting are the ones making all the stuff we buy! so who is really to blame?). It's an awful thing for privileged people to look down our* noses at people who have less than us. Especially when a lot of the social inequity in the world is caused by the wasteful practices of the modernized countries. The book illustrates the COUNTER-ARGUMENT to the belief held by many privileged people, that wealth and privilege stem from being STRONGER PEOPLE somehow (smarter, harder working, more motivated, etc), than the people who are poor. (And therefore: many privileged people feel justified in trampling on the rights and needs of poor people.) Because it illustrates this point so well, I think this book is excellent. (*Note: I count myself as a privileged person, for sure. As such, I know how easy it is to forget that I personally haven't earned that. If I had been born in a different situation, I'd have a totally different life. This book is very good at reminding us of this.) Also, I *really* liked the ending. No matter how F'ed up the world is, no matter how much suffering and betrayal we have endured as individuals, it is still possible to find within us, a heart of goodness, to help others in need. That was pretty much what I got out of the final line of the book. I found it very uplifting! Another thing I found interesting in reading the reviews: many people saw the white couple, Kyra & Delaney, as the villains, while seeing America & Candido as the underdog heroes. This was surprising to me. I actually thought that both couples were equally sympathetic or unsympathetic. I felt that both couples were stereotypes, made more believable by the human touches that the author added (America mustering the courage to go into town when Candido was hurt, Kyra's thoughtfulness in getting Delaney the step-ladder, Delaney putting aside the fight over \"the wall\" and kissing Kyra passionately in the grocery store, Candido killing household pets in his desperation to keep his family alive, Delaney destroying the photos showing who the real graffiti artist was) ... so, one of the redeeming qualities, I think, was the feeling that the author was not \"taking sides\" or villainizing one group or the other."}, {"userName": "F", "userReviewDate": "Jul 22, 2013", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/8161922-f", "userReview": "I hated this book!

An arrogant author, white and male, taking on huge socio-political issues and reducing them to 300+ pages of exaggerated, trite, offensive dribble. Another case of the white male fiction writer appopriating the voice of an ethnic minority in his work. And, yes, Boyle writes this with an interjection of the cultural elite, of whiteness, which for some crazy reason seems to give him access to minority groups, their feelings, their thoughts, their actions, their lives. For such a deliberate approach to addressing a very sensitive issue, I don't see any trace of humanity or compassion or sense of responsibility in Boyle's writing. The worst part is that this book continues to be used across the country in high schools and colleges as reading material on immigration reform! Another white male author part of a long line of celebrated writers shifting the American perception of minority groups. Boyle is lauded as \"timely\" and \"provocative\" by a white liberal america that is severely removed from reality. His characters are, at best, gross caricatures of the so-called reality his novel describes. My fear is that young readers will come away with less understanding and critical awareness of class struggle after reading this book in their institutions of higher learning."}, {"userName": "Livia Stone", "userReviewDate": "Oct 14, 2007", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/538362-livia-stone", "userReview": "This is the book that finally put me off of fiction written for adults. Unless you live under a rock with cotton in your ears and a bag over your head, you know that life sucks and the human experience is filled with misery and despair. When I spend my precious time reading, I want to read something well-written and inspiring, regardless of the content.For example: You can read something about the holocaust, and come away feeling amazed and grateful that there are some people in the world capable of doing extraordinary things in times of utter despair. Or you can read something that makes you want to blow your brains out and smack the pretentious idiot who wrote it, who seems to think that wallowing in the wretchedness of human existence makes him an amazing writer."}, {"userName": "Michael", "userReviewDate": "Apr 30, 2007", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/73396-michael", "userReview": "\"The Tortilla Curtain\" by T.C. Boyle is not without its flaws, but even a decade or more after publication, it has only grown in its relevance regarding the deep-seated problems of illegal immigration, particularly the Mexican-southwestern U.S. nexus.Boyle tells the story of two couples, one rich, white and privileged, the other homeless, Mexican and struggling, and how their lives intersect. Delaney and Kyra live in a polished, gated community north of Los Angeles, where she works as a real estate agent and he is a house-husband, ministering to his step-son and wife and writing a local environmental column. Delaney appears to be a classic, Eastern liberal -- although circumstances end up tearing off his veneer to reveal the darker attitudes that lurk just below the surface.Candido is Delaney's homeless, immigrant counterpart, a Mexican with a pregnant young wife, neither of whom can catch a break.In alternating chapters, their stories are told. The plot hurtles forward on Boyle's expert prose and the depiction of one vivid incident after another.While Boyle does skewer the privileged white folks without much mercy, there is enough dimension and complexity here for this reader to say that the author isn't merely bashing for the sake of bashing. The problem isn't easy, the anti-immigrant reactions aren't without justification, and no pat solutions are presented. What is presented is this horrendous confluence between haves and have-nots, and an environment in which the cultural, economic and language divide is deep and disturbing and far too open to tragic misunderstandings.This is not a problem that is going away; if anything, it has become more acute since Boyle wrote his book. I think where he succeeds the most is in getting us inside the heads of two desperate Mexican immigrants who are, at heart, honorable people. He helps us understand why they were driven to leave their homeland, gives us empathy for their plight -- while at the same time, managing to genuinely irritate us about their bad judgments. One is left, I think, with the sense that we -- as a nation of immigrants -- need to pay far closer attention to where we are going, and to develop public policies and resources toward genuine solutions. Terrible burdens are being paid every day for lack of this -- on both sides of the equation."}, {"userName": "Cyndi", "userReviewDate": "Jul 11, 2017", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/7132123-cyndi", "userReview": "This is probably not going to be a popular opinion, but...I didn't like this book very much.

I knew people like Candido and America, good, honest, hard-working folks who only wanted a chance to live and prosper, who spent each waking moment dreading the appearance of La Migra. TC Boyle has characterized these people beautifully. They're not angels, and he nailed the bad elements, the punks and chucos, just as thoroughly as he brought his protagonists to life on the page. If people think this book DOESN'T deal with the reality of life in Southern California...and Northern California, and Arizona, and Texas, and New Mexico, anywhere where the \"haves\" need the services and cheap back-breaking labor of the \"have-nots\"...then you need to get out more and leave the blinders at home! TC sets the action early and he is relentless. The Rashoman-style serves him well, although he was brutal in his descriptions of Delaney and Kyra and their neighbors...the quintessential liberal do-gooders in their SUV's and mammoth gated communities eating up the very \"wildness\" they glorify while sipping Chardonnay and munching smoked sturgeon. This book does an excellent job of throwing a spotlight on the racial discord, which unfortunately grows by leaps and bounds daily, particularly in our post-911 and Border Minutemen hysteria. What was true in 1995 has only intensified in 2010 growing to include irrational fear towards anyone \"different\" from the Euro-descended, workaholic, Christian villagers. Listen to the community fathers and mothers fret about homeless tent cities being moved to their 'hoods. It's a wonder we don't have torches descending on the churchyards harboring these supposed \"sex perverts\" and \"thieves\"...guilty by way of bad luck. Read this book. Get a look at the other side of your office cleaning lady's life, the reality of that small dark man with the leaf blower or stacking the shelves in your local Wal-Mart.

It's full of depressing, tragic (to the point of being very unrealistic in my opinion) events that keep on occurring to a poor, immigrant Mexican family. Their plight is contrasted with the transformation of a self-described \"liberal humanist\" into a paranoid racist who is obsessed with catching them. Except that the change in him is so dramatic in a relatively short time frame that I found it hard to believe. I found the book heavy on trite cliches with no development of any of the main characters (except Delaney), all of whom are one-dimensional and pretty much only evoke pity or dislike.

Boyle, dass es nahezu keinen Roman gibt, der mich g\u00e4nzlich von den Socken reisst und mich restlos begeistert? Gut dieses Buch ist gut - ok was sage ich - es ist sogar sehr gut, aber irgendwas ist immer, sodass ich erst einmal wirklich vollen Herzens 5 Punkte vergeben konnte. Diesmal bin ich irgendwo bei 4,5 und runde wohlwollend auf.Es fing ganz wunderbar an: Ganz Boyle untypisch sparte sich der Autor das ewige Herumgelabere warf den Leser mitten in die Geschichte - in zwei Welten oben und unten, arm und reich, Amerikaner und Mexikaner abwechselnd beschrieben.America, auch the Tortilla Curtain, habe ich ganz bewu\u00dft heuer aus meinem SUB gezogen, denn in Anbetracht der Tatsache, was sich gerade mit Donald Trump in Amerika an Rassismus gegen die Mexikaner abspielt, ist dieses Werk sicher grade topaktuell. Dabei fiel mir auf, dass der Roman eigentlich vor 22 Jahren als \u00fcberspannte Satire mit auf die Spitze getriebenen klischeehaften Archetypen geplant war. Leider hat die Realit\u00e4t die Satire schon l\u00e4ngst \u00fcberholt. Die ehemals b\u00fcrgerliche gr\u00fcne Linke ist in die Jahre gekommen und hat sich schleichend von gr\u00fcn zu braun (und das meine ich wie es hier steht) entwickelt - ist somit faulig geworden. Mit den Tieren hat man noch immer vollstes Mitleid und Verst\u00e4ndnis, und lebt unter ihnen ohne Furcht auch wenn die wilden Coyoten einem zwei Hunde t\u00f6ten, der Fremde an der Ecke ist aber gef\u00e4hrlich geh\u00f6rt ausgesperrt, vernichtet und n\u00f6tigenfalls nihiliert. Ein Menschenleben z\u00e4hlt nix ein Tierleben umso mehr, deshalb fordert man auch, v\u00f6llig alle Relationen verlierend, vehement die Todesstrafe f\u00fcr Carnivoren und andere, die Tiere aus welchen Gr\u00fcnden auch immer t\u00f6ten. Diese  BOBOS  - ja es gibt diesen Typus bereits zu Hauf auch bei uns und eine Bezeichnung wurde auch gleich kreiert - bev\u00f6lkern in Wien bereits mehrere Bezirke - wollen in sch\u00f6ne Ecken ziehen auch aufs Land und sobald sie dort sind, agitieren sie gegen alle anderen und sperren sie aus. Dies ist auch die perfekte Analogie zum Roman. Man hat viel Geld, lebt nachhaltig und zeigt \u00fcberheblich mit seinem Lebensstil und dem moralischen Zeigefinger auf die Armen, die man erstens unbedingt aus seinem eigenen Leben hinausschmeissen muss, und die einfach gezwungen werden sollten, sich anders zu verhalten. Nat\u00fcrlich ist man f\u00fcr Ausl\u00e4nder so ganz prinzipiell, aber sicher nicht in der eigenen privaten Waldorfschule - wo k\u00e4men wir denn da hin! Selbstverst\u00e4ndlich nutzt man den eigenen SUV aber nur gaanz selten, um ins Wochenendhaus in der Natur zu fahren, aber wehe ein armer Tropf von Pendler vom Land, der nur in die Arbeit fahren muss, braucht einen Parkplatz im eigenen Stadtwohnbezirk, der soll ruhig \u00f6ffentlich fahren der Umwelt zuliebe 2 Stunden mehr pro Tag verplempern, denn die Parkpl\u00e4tze sind nur f\u00fcr die eigne Community reserviert. Ich kann ja \u00fcber die derzeitigen Leute in Amerika nicht reden, weil ich nicht dort wohne, aber da dieser Achetyp auch bei uns schon komplett durchgeschlagen hat, kann man diesen Roman von Boyle als regelrecht prophetisch bezeichnen, dass die 22 jahre alte \"Dystopie\" der Gesellschaft exakt Realit\u00e4t wurde. Delany ist Umweltsch\u00fctzer und Demokrat hat sich mitten in die Natur gebaut, die er respektiert, aber wehe er sieht ein mexikanisches Gesicht der Armut, dann kennt er keine Gnade mehr. Da wird zwar schon zu Beginn noch mit ein paar prinzipiellen ethischen Skrupeln gek\u00e4mpft, aber durch die perfekte T\u00e4ter-Opfer Umkehr wird das mexikanische Opfer eines Autounfalls, bei dem man erstens medizinische Hilfeleistung unterlassen und die illegale Notlage ausnutzend einen Schwerverletzten mit 20 Dollar abgespeist hat, zu einem mexikanischen Betr\u00fcger, der einem absichtlich ins Auto gelaufen ist und somit um 20 Dollar Betrug begangen hat. So geht es in der abgeschotteten gutb\u00fcrgerlich reichen Siedlung weiter: Erst kommt ein Tor, um die braven anst\u00e4ndigen Leute vor dem b\u00f6sen armen Gesocks zu sch\u00fctzen und dann eine Mauer und dann bewaffnet man sich bis an die Z\u00e4hne. Auch die mexikanische Sicht - die Gesellschaft unten wird sehr gut beschrieben, mit wenig Sozialromantik behaftet, sondern genauso brutal und sch\u00e4big wie sie eben ist: Der t\u00e4gliche Kampf ums \u00dcberleben von Candido dem Familienvater in spe auf der Suche nach einem Job und den anderen Armen im Canyon. Nat\u00fcrlich muss man als Mann auch weiter nach unten auf die Schw\u00e4cheren treten, darf seine Frau verpr\u00fcgeln, wenn man nicht gut drauf ist, junge M\u00e4nner vergewaltigen andere Frauen ohne jede Skrupel und rauben sich einfach gegenseitig permanent aus.So schlecht kann es einem gar nicht gehen, dass man nicht ohne Not noch jemandem, der schutzlos ist, etwas ganz Furchtbares antun kann. Irgendwann kurz vor Ende fand ich die Geschichte dann etwas langweilig und vorhersehbar. Ist man normalerweise bei Boyle ganz \u00fcberfordert von dem Gewusel an Aktivit\u00e4ten, Beschreibungen, Figuren und Handlung, ist diesmal irgendwie alles zu normal und dramaturgisch wenig \u00fcberraschend. Das ist auch der kleine Kritikpunkt am Roman. Diesmal werden die typischen Schw\u00e4chen des Autors in Bezug auf \u00dcbertreibung so unterrated, dass sie nicht zu St\u00e4rken, sondern zu erneuten aber nur ganz leichten Schw\u00e4chen mutieren. Das Ende ist dann wieder grossartig, einerseits sozial-romantisch klischeehaft, aber im Sinne des brutalen Credos des Romans dennoch \u00fcberraschend."}, {"userName": "mark", "userReviewDate": "Mar 22, 2008", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/58766-mark", "userReview": "I took this out from the library over a year ago. I lost the book, paid for it, found it again, settled in to read it, but before I could do this Ryan returned it to the library thinking that it was way way overdue. Enough time has elapsed for me to overcome my feeling of foolishness, so I checked it out again. As it turns out, the timing was perfect. In the past week, the political landscape has turned racially quite ugly. And my passage through this book kept perfect time with the dispatches from CNN. Both the book and the political situation have an unresolved ending, but both point towards living with it. T.C. Boyle's writing is not particularly astounding in its craft, but I found the story to be quite engaging. Similar to \"The House of Sand and Fog\" the characters are annoyingly short-sighted and narrow minded, and you can see a trajectory that will surely be disastrous for all involved. Boyle gives his characters ways out of these situations, ways that are obvious to the reader, but the characters themselves are blind to these and invariably head the wrong direction. It would be a great gift to be able to read our own lives, see our own prejudices and foolishness as well as we can see them in Boyle's characters."}, {"userName": "M.L.

Lo and behold I see a portrait of the author, a white man, on the back cover. Of course I didn\u2019t even need to see a portrait of the author, because the first chapter was from the perspective of a liberal white male, and of course, when you\u2019re a white guy and you\u2019re writing about the experience of a non-white person, you need to juxtapose it with the white experience to relate to all your white readers! And, of course, the non-white characters in this books are gross, exaggerated stereotypes. The Mexican men are violent, animalistic, aggressively sexual, sexist thefts, while the one Mexican woman is a submissive, flat character. Although his white characters aren\u2019t supposed to be likable, by writing a novel like this, trying to encapsulate the immigrant experience while also adding the white experience, makes him almost as bad as the white characters he creates. Of course Boyle had good intentions, as do most liberal white authors who attempt to take on social/political issues that do not include them, but when one has never experienced racism, when one has never had the experience of an immigrant, it is nearly impossible to pull off a well-written and inoffensive piece of writing to encapsulate it. I\u2019m not saying that white authors should steer away from writing about people who aren\u2019t white (please do), but the phrase \u201cwrite what you know\u201d is pretty solid advice. There are plenty of books written by white authors (for example Life of Pi) that are beautiful and inoffensive, but mainly because they aren\u2019t about social/political problems the people they write about face, but rather a universal experience that can relate to everyone. It isn\u2019t even the subtle racism of this book that annoys me, it is simply not a smart book. The symbols are blatantly obvious. (the names Am\u00e9rica and Resurrecion/the coyotes and the dogs/the Spanish styled houses and names). The book is obviously trying to be smart and progressive, but it\u2019s a shallow, flat, and unimpressive work that I am shocked would be considered for an AP Language Arts class.

It works to the degree in that the suburban pair preferred to have their causes at several layers of removal , preferring safe memberships in organizations forever raising money for non controversial progressive causes; a check or a credit card donation was the exercise of their social responsibility, an acceptable penance for what is largely a consumerist lifestyle. Boyle does not sugar coat, euphemise nor glorify the awful trials and fate of the Mexican couple that had stolen over the border looking for a better life. Against a backdrop of a terrain of sunshine, opulence and the saturation of Conspicuous Consumption, Boyle tenders life at the margins, at the edges of glittering downtowns and cascading suburbs. Boyle is stinging and blunt in the way he describes the ordeals economic desperation that drives good people, and he is unsparing at offering up a priceless, painfully recognizable banter of a privileged psychology that inspects the hard facts of injustice and responds by trying to worm their way out of any sense of responsibility for others less well endowed."}, {"userName": "Jessica", "userReviewDate": "Jan 29, 2009", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/1535249-jessica", "userReview": "This book is honestly one of the worst I have ever read. While the author shows clear skill and talent at detailed imagery, he often takes things to an unwanted, graphic level. There is a scene where one of the main characters is described to 'shake his prick' after taking a leak. TMI, thank you very much. While the same action (or lack of it) was referenced in the novel \"Empire Falls\", the author of that novel had a clear point in it; to depict the character as unclean. In the Tortilla Curtain, I found no such point. The author is supposedly well known for skilled use of irony and satire, but I find myself agreeing with a review done by the New York Times; the author seems to have grown arrogant with praise, and his usual skill at satire becomes a very tiring volley of cheap shots.

But I was really bothered with his approach to such politically and socially-charged subject matter. Boyle clearly had an agenda, and for the better part of the read, his argument came across as oversimplified (especially after finishing the deliciously complicated, messy, challenging, put-your-balls-out-there manifesto The Mandibles). \"Privileged\" characters Delaney and Kyra are given equal screentime to illegal immigrants Candido and America, and unfortunately read like caricatures, with no redeeming qualities. (Delaney and Kyra: BAD. Candido and America: GOOD.)This is still a thought-provoking read about what happens when two classes live side by side, probably more relevant now than ever. But it read more like a parable to me than a novel.

I liked the writing style and enjoyed most of the story.I wasn\u2019t wild about some of the events that happened toward the end of the book: I thought they were heavy handed and unnecessary; it was the slice of life events that I found most interesting and I didn\u2019t need any big \u201cblockbuster\u201d events.Rife with symbolism and commentary on various topics & themes: most especially America\u2019s illegal immigration and Mexico\u2019s dire poverty problems, but also: coyotes & nature/desperate Mexican immigrants/affluent white southern Californians; different kinds of prisons; the drive for survival; nature & human nature; the presence or absence of safety; inequities: have and have-nots human beings; etc. I haven\u2019t uttered the phrase \u201cit isn\u2019t fair\u201d since I was seven because I\u2019m acutely aware that nothing about life is fair.

I think that both couples (Kyra & Delaney, America & Candido) were equally sympathetic and unsympathetic. I feel that both couples are stereotypes, made more believable by the human touches that the author added.I think it is chilling the way the author wrote about these \"do-gooder\" types (Kyra & Delaney) and how they are so careful to exercise regularly, live a healthy lifestyle, and be \"aware\" of society's ills (like the way Kyra speaks out against animal abuse, how Delaney speaks out against feeding coyoytes)...but at the same time, the author underscores how wasteful they are, with their brand new cars, expensive house built in wildfire country...it's like the couple in the book give themselves a lot of \"brownie points\" for all these details, while missing the big picture. The book illustrates the COUNTER-ARGUMENT to the belief, held by many privileged people, that wealth and privilege stem from being STRONGER PEOPLE somehow (smarter, harder working, more motivated, etc), than the people who are poor. For this reason, I think this book is excellent. Also, I really liked the ending. No matter how f'ed up the world is, no matter how much suffering and betrayal we have endured as individuals, it is still possible to find within us, a heart of goodness, to help others in need. That was pretty much what I got out of the final line of the book. I found it very uplifting! My one criticism is that the book seemed to take much longer than it needed to in order to get its point across. I found myself speed reading through parts that seemed more drawn out than they had to be. But I love the issues that arise and how it makes you rethink things. A great discussion book."}, {"userName": "Margaret Tufo", "userReviewDate": "Mar 09, 2008", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/980073-margaret-tufo", "userReview": "I read this for a class that dealt with immigration issues. It is a wonderful example of being born with privilege. Quick and easy read. Gave it 4/5 because the female characters are poorly developed (as is rest of TC Boyle's novels). I got frustrated with this novel because of the bad things that constantly happened to the protagonists and the in-your-face irony, but it had its good points as well.

He tells parallel stories of affluent Americans seeking refuge from L.A. in the canyons beyond its perimeter and indigent immigrants also living in those canyons--but not in beautiful homes--while trying to make a life and a family on a day laborer's wages and at the mercy of nature, which is not very merciful.C\u00e1ndido and Am\u00e9rica come from Tepotzlan, an enchanting town in Morelos not that far from Mexico City I happen to know fairly well. She is 17. He is in his early 30s. They have entered the U.S. with no formalities, are brutalized in passage, and barely survive on minimal food and in minimal shelter.Delaney is a naturalist and his wife Kyra is a realtor. He's a liberal environmentalist who gradually turns against what he, and others, feel is the endless invasion of what Donald Trump would call crooks, murderers, and rapists.The canyons surrounding L.A. are not \"better\" than Tepotzlan. They are not more beautiful, welcoming, or special, but they are associated with American wealth, and that's what draws Mexicans without visas to the U.S. Boyle describes C\u00e1ndido and Am\u00e9rica's plight poignantly, the insults to their dignity and their dreams,their desperation,imagination, and fortitude. Boyle is less kind to Kyra and Delaney, self-absorbed and convinced of the rightness of their wealth and their commitment to pristine nature, far from L.A.'s freeways.Quite skillfully Boyle engineers a plot that generates lots of truths about what both couples feel toward one another, but he tells a tale that is very difficult to resolve.Today (November, 2015), we are witnessing the continuing migration of economic and political refugees from the Middle East, South Asia and Africa into Europe. Their circumstances,and Europe's problems, are extreme, but anyone who knows the U.S.-Mexico border knows that our two countries have been experiencing extreme migratory difficulties for decades.As a diplomat many years ago I had responsibility for certain aspects of U.S.-Mexican border relations. My mandate stretched from Tijuana to Brownsville. I watched Mexicans and others cross into the U.S. at night using infrared binoculars, I visited maquiladoras, universities, elementary schools, city halls, environmental disasters, and the searing, bleached wastes of the desert on which Trump says he will build a beautiful 2,000 mile wall. (This is really, really insulting to the intelligence of the American electorate, by the way. It's shameless buffoonery.)Boyle masterfully gets at all this in fictional terms. He depicts the resentments and struggles in his characters' lives and circumstances with strong, vivid, accurate writing. In the process, he dramatizes the essentially unresolvable dilemmas of human migration between the Third World and the First.What we see in Europe these days is mind boggling, but it is more or less a tenth of what has transpired between Mexico and the U.S for the last five decades. If it is true, and I really don't know that it is, that we have 12 million non-citizen migrants in the U.S. from south of the border, think of how that would look should it make the nightly news on an ongoing basis. But unless a conservative, ill-informed and unrealistic (not to mention heartless) politician is out there throwing red meat to his equally conservative, ill-informed and unrealistic supporters, this wave of humanity is only sporadically covered.Attitudes change in the border zone depending how close you are to the actual line of demarcation. People in Tijuana and San Diego don't look at migration the same way that people in Hermosillo and Calabasas look at it. The same is true when you think of El Paso and Juarez in contrast to Monterrey and Austin. The border zone proper, 25 miles or so on either side, is a world unto itself, comes up with its own solutions, and begs for and seldom receives adequate resources from the federal government. Deeper in either the U.S. and Mexico, the migration phenomenon becomes more alien, spooky, and threatening. Delaney in Boyle's novel does a marvelous job of totally misinterpreting C\u00e1ndido. He's constantly wrong, which is not to say C\u00e1ndido really has any idea what he's doing.The problem is survival, it's miscommunication, it's cultural and linguistic differences, it's need on the one side, surfeit on the other.I think it's best that novels do not try to propose policy solutions. Boyle avoids this. He looks at human quandaries and makes them real for the reader. Then it's up to the reader to decide: is the way we run this world the right way?Probably not."}, {"userName": "Christopher Lele", "userReviewDate": "Apr 17, 2007", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/61595-christopher-lele", "userReview": "Tortilla Curtain gives a human face to an issue that all too often is cast in its extremes. Talk show hosts rail against 'illegals' taking over our country and our jobs; the other side demonizes the government and equates their handling of Mexicans the way that Hitler handled the Jews. In the end, both sides make us want to plug our ears. Illegal immigration, what should be done, how we should think about, is far more complex and nuanced than that. So it refreshing to see T.C. Boyle tries to capture the humanity of the migrant workers we all too readily cast out of our conscious as below us. Some will argue that his treatment of America, the ironically named wife, of is overly sympathetic, and at times bordering on bathos. Yes, Boyle may cross the line a few times, but as a novelist drawing on the dramatic, he has some license to thrust the couple into unlikely situations, and to make them.I did have a little problem with the way he drew the two white characters (who like the Mexican couple, Boyle allows the reader to inhabit their psyche.) As the cliche odious yuppies they weren't that believable. The wife esp., an alpha-alpha female bent on beating the crap out of anything that got in her way, seemed only a prop for Boyle with which to contrast the noble suffering of the abject, soul-shattered Mexican couple. Read: bad shallow whites vs. simple, yet virtuous immigrants.Still, those minor quibbles aside, I would recommend this book, esp. for reading groups or college (maybe even mature high school)lit classes. The writing is exquisite, truly the work of a master (Boyle is able to take an accident scene and infuse it with so much tension and momentum that his way with words, phrases, and paragraphs is nearly.) Ultimately, I would like to see Tortilla Curtain as part of the sociology/ethnic literature canon as I have come across few works that capture the ethnic tinderbox that our country so complacently and precariously rests on."}, {"userName": "Donna", "userReviewDate": "Sep 07, 2014", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/13244359-donna", "userReview": "I browsed some of the reviews before starting this book. People either loved it or hated it. So with that, I knew I had to read it. I think those who didn\u2019t like it, expected something more ... more realism ... more research of the rising and contentious border problem ... more character development ... just more! I admit it lacked some of those things to some degree. But I felt that is wasn\u2019t written with a serious hand that wanted to reveal a deep dark expose on the plight of illegals. The author definitely had his story to tell, but it wasn\u2019t meant to be deep and informative.Overall I liked it. Sometimes I found myself paying more attention to the writing, than the story. I liked his writing. He kept the story at a nice pace. The author relied heavily on typical stereotypes for his characters. They were always completely true to whatever stereotype they were meant to fill. But I have to say that truth resonated in them and around them in such a way that it made me feel uncomfortable at times regarding both sides. It did offer food for thought regarding this growing turmoil with no solution on the horizon. I have a son currently living in El Salvador, and he says he knows a lot of locals who have been deported 6 \u2013 8 times and are already planning and saving for their next border crossing. And I have another son who spent some time in Honduras, who had similar stories.

We all agreed that the book is even more relevant today than when it was written 1995. It explores the mindset of liberal whites when they are challenged with interacting with homeless illegal Mexicans that are living in their canyon. When Delaney Mossbach hit Candido Rincon with his car, he was unaware that the seemly wild canyon he lived by was inhabited by homeless Mexicans. The story goes between the lives of the Mossbachs and Candido and his wife America that live in the canyon while Candido tries to get work. T.C. Boyle really examines the difference of their lives and finds humor and irony in the situations. When the Mossbach's dog was taken by a coyote that jumped the fence it was very disturbing for them, the obvious parallel was the Mexicans that were threatening their security by jumping the border. The story is well written and presents the situation with humor and pathos. We all enjoyed the book and found it very interesting and worthwhile reading."}, {"userName": "Allison Floyd", "userReviewDate": "Dec 04, 2010", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/805686-allison-floyd", "userReview": "I had to cry uncle after chapter one on this one.
