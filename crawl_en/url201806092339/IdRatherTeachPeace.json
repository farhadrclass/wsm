A little inspiring, a little tame. Probably much more invigorating to the aspiring peace teacher. But more pointed and aggressive than I'd expected from a columnist from the Washington Post.I told Ryan I was reading this and he made some grumbling noises about people who do other careers, then teach for a year and write a best seller. This is a bit better than what I imagine that lot to be, but still an important critique. On the other hand (and maybe most personally relevant to me now...) McCarthy concludes by stating that the only way he was able to be so successful in bringing Peace Studies to such varied audiences (public high schools, colleges, law schools, prison schools) was by NOT making it his primary career. Interesting. Sorta how I feel about culture making in general? IE the corrupting influence of the wage/salary/\"living\"?I'm keeping it on the shelf, I suspect I may revisit over the coming years."}, {"userName": "Thing Two", "userReviewDate": "Feb 25, 2012", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/3722823-thing-two", "userReview": "When the now retired Washington Post columnist Colman McCarthy was asked to teach a class on writing at Washington's School without Walls, he reportedly responded, \"I'd rather teach peace.\"This book is a collection of lectures given over a period of time to students all across the country. McCarthy believes if we don't teach peace to our children, someone will teach them violence. He's adamantly against war and lectures on non-violence, conflict resolution, and pacifism. My favorite lecture was one that included an exercise to cause students to reflect on the manipulation of authority. Excellent book - it should be required reading for all high school students."}, {"userName": "Brent Fernandez", "userReviewDate": "Apr 11, 2009", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/1983771-brent-fernandez", "userReview": "if you teach social justice at any level, or wish to incorporate social justice in your classroom for any subject, please read this book."}, {"userName": "Stephanie Moran", "userReviewDate": "Jul 16, 2017", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/6176855-stephanie-moran", "userReview": "I absolutely loved this book.McCarthy shares with the reader what a semester of teaching peace is like. He discusses his tactics with different groups of children/teens/young adults. I liked a lot of his ideas. Many of them reminded me of the way I hear my grandfather talk - for example - McCarthy states that students should ask for a refund of their public education because they don't teach the other side. Students know all about war and war generals - but we don't learn about peace advocates - save Martin Luther King Jr. - but even then, we don't hear his anti-war messages.This book is chalked full further resources, which is what I was primarily grateful for."}, {"userName": "Gabriella Bugge", "userReviewDate": "Jun 28, 2017", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/50376535-gabriella-bugge", "userReview": "A must-read for anyone in education and anyone interested in peace studies or the promotion of peace studies."}, {"userName": "Larry Bassett", "userReviewDate": "Mar 14, 2011", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/3816725-larry-bassett", "userReview": "If you have a shred of idealism, read I\u2019d Rather Teach Peace by Coleman McCarthy. The idealistic part of you will love you for it. It made me admire Colman McCarthy all over again. This book and its nonviolent message deserve every one of the five stars I am giving it.I am a lapsed peace activist. I have retreated to primarily being a financial contributor to the peace and justice movement. I am proud of my past activities and actions for peace that included community organizing and civil disobedience. I am willing to bet that, like me, Coleman McCarthy would like to do more. I try not to feel too guilty that I am merely a cheerleader. Books like I\u2019d Rather Teach Peace remind me of my heritage of radical activism and give me hope that a new generation will take the struggle from the present to the future. Colman McCarthy was, for many years, a syndicated columnist for The Washington Post. He still writes occasional op-ed pieces. Last I heard he was teaching peace studies classes in high schools and colleges and speaking regularly at conferences. I once sat in on one of his classes in Bethesda, Maryland. I wanted to work out a partnership with Colman so we could do this work together. We talked about my proposal but Colman chose to continue volunteer teaching on his own, funded by a small non-profit, the Center for Teaching Peace, run out of his home. I was disappointed since I was sure he would want someone to join him in his work. I experienced rejection, something that many have to deal on a daily basis. But McCarthy remains a guide as to how someone can reach out to the entire age range of students and show them another way to think about the world. He teaches them about Gandhi, about King, about Dorothy Day, about the Berrigan brothers, and other people who chose a path of nonviolence.This is a how-to book. It shows by example how to teach nonviolence from preschool to law school. You get to sit in on the classes. The author has years of experience teaching peace and shares those experiences with us. And in that sharing, he teaches us about peace and nonviolence. It is an idea that is not in the main stream of American life. Pacifism is not something that boys and girls aspire to. McCarthy says that we have to change that, one person at a time, if we are to change the world. The book delves into animal rights, prisons and the justice system, the death penalty, the honor of teaching. These are all part of the realm of nonviolence.Why should you read this book? You want to learn about the history of nonviolent action. You want to learn about peaceful alternatives to war and violence. You are interested in contributing in some way to making a more peaceful society. You hope to become a better person and make a difference in the world. You want to achieve a greater awareness of the world. You want to further your own spirituality. You want to broaden your view of the political spectrum. These are some of the reasons students told McCarthy they had enrolled in his peace education classes. If you read this 140 page book, you will probably find yourself learning and changing. You will be encouraged to do something."}, {"userName": "Kelly", "userReviewDate": "Dec 25, 2008", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/815638-kelly", "userReview": "This changed my perspective on the way I lived my life to the subject I wished to teach. I no longer saw history as a string of wars and economic crisis'. The work of Colman McCarthy inspired me to research and incorporate peace education into my daily teaching and my Masters project. This book is excellent for anyone interested in breaking the pattern of apathy, whereever they encounter it. You don't have to be a teacher.Like I said about the Alchemist...read it, it'll change your life."}, {"userName": "Abigail", "userReviewDate": "Mar 31, 2014", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/29586892-abigail", "userReview": "This book is an inspiring collection of thoughts pulled from the mind of the wonderful Colman McCarthy.
