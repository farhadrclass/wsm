This is the second book featuring the surfing private detective Boone Daniels. An ex-cop turned PI, Boone seems to be the epitome of SoCal surf culture with a lifestyle that revolves around spending as much time as possible in the water with his surfing pals, the Dawn Patrol. Boone gets roped into a job that he doesn\u2019t much want by Petra, a lawyer and his kinda sorta girlfriend.Surfing legend and beloved community activist Kelly Kuhio, also known as K2, was killed in a senseless act of violence by a young punk representing the dark side of surfing territoriality. K2 was a friend of Boone\u2019s, and he wants nothing to do with the case when Petra asks him to help prove that it wasn\u2019t premeditated murder so they can get a reduced sentence for the punk. After realizing that K2 would never want anyone to be scapegoat in a misguided attempt to seek justice for him, Boone reluctantly signs on, but this instantly puts him at odds with the surfing community he loves and his friends in the Dawn Patrol, especially his best friend Johnny who was the cop who got a confession in K2\u2019s death. Another rich surfer adds to Boone\u2019s mental stress by begging him to find out if his wife is cheating on him.Just like The Dawn Patrol this book has a unique setting and likeable main character. Winslow conversational style makes the reader understand surf culture and as always, his writing is entertaining as hell. However, the two Boone books rate a bit down my Winslow scale. There\u2019s nothing wrong with them, and I\u2019d recommend them to anyone looking for a readable mystery with style, but they just lack a certain heft that you get in Winslow\u2019s best like Savages or The Power of the Dog or The Winter of Frankie Machine. But since the worst thing I can say about them is that they aren\u2019t Don Winslow\u2019s best books, it still means they\u2019re pretty damn good."}, {"userName": "Darwin8u", "userReviewDate": "Jan 14, 2018", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/2294090-darwin8u", "userReview": "\"Violence on the beach is very uncool.\"- Don Winslow, The Gentlemen's HourSan Diego Surf Noir, Take Two.I'm enough of a Don Winslow fan after The Power of the Dog and The Cartel to seek after al of Winslow books's. There is a cost and a benefit of going back to read earlier books of an author you admire.Cost: The books, invariably, are a bit weaker. This is usually the case. Writers grow, develop, and yes they too eventually slump. But this one follows the typical arc of a writer's carrer. This isn't top-shelf Don Winslow. Some of the characters are almost silly. The stories are a bit too neat and symetrical. So, you end up being a bit disappointed when viewing an author backwards. Try reading Mardi after reading Moby-Dick. I dare you. It is still writen by Herman Melville, but it ends up being a bit of a let down.Benefit: You get to see early seeds of things that will eventually grow and mature in the author's later, greater novels. These are like recognizing waves that will eventually be surfable. You also recognize that not every novel has to be perfect to be enjoyable. I like Winslow as a writer and as a person.* I enjoy reading his early stuff because it gives me a better, more rounded, view of his later work. So despite the criticisms here and there, it still helps.The Gentlemen's Hour is part two of the Winslow's Boone Daniel series (read The Dawn Patrol first). It follows the adventures of Boone Daniel, surfing P.I. and his band of surfing brothers (The Dawn Patrol), and yes sisters, as they deal with the friction of shifting loyalties, visions and ethics of life. It was Sprite, not gin, and went down easy. Some days, you just want a Sprite.* I think he is generous with other writers and very approachable to his fans."}, {"userName": "Michelle Curie", "userReviewDate": "May 03, 2018", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/27203016-michelle-curie", "userReview": "You know surfer dudes? Don't pretend you don't, because everyone knows surfer dudes: laid-back and easy going, probably good-looking and always up for adventure (of the next wave). That's Boone Daniels, whom we first met in The Dawn Patrol and whom I've started to genuinely miss. So here I went. The Gentleman's Hour takes us back to San Diego's Pacific Beach, where surfer and private investigator Boone Daniels is case-less and not doing particularly well financially (as per usual), which leads him to taking on a hatred matrimonial case. But then someone gets killed in the surfing community and lawyer Petra and the painful truth that violence is seeping into his safe haven can no longer be ignored.\n\"Is this what has you so jacked up? That this murder confirmed something you've known for a long time but didn't want to admit - that surfing isn't the Utopia you always wanted it to be? Needed it to be?\"\nThe characters though. This second book works as a stand-alone novel, but knowing all the characters already made me way more into it, especially when I realized that even close to a year after reading The Dawn Patrol I still remembered all of them: Winslow has just created an awesome and memorial bunch and a believable friendship group that makes you root for each and every one of them. They've all also grown quite a bit since the first one, feeling like real people with all their quirks and occasionally out-of-line behaviors. For someone who isn't a hard-boiled surfer egg, it provides a lot of humor as well, especially when the characters start talking in something that can be identified as surfer language, for which Winslow will literally provide a (much needed) translation. It's hilarious. Speaking of which, it's the conversational tone that gives the world such a distinct voice, making this a wonderfully summery read. Can't wait to read more of Don Winslow's work!"}, {"userName": "Tfitoby", "userReviewDate": "May 06, 2012", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/5454475-tfitoby", "userReview": "Pretty much the only positive I have to report from this second Boone Daniels surfing PI novel is that it was an easy read. Beyond that it kinda sucked. It's a generic trope filled crime novel complete with two different cases becoming interlinked as the investigation gathers momentum, but the major crime as far as I'm concerned is that Boone Daniels is a moron, one of the dumbest private detectives I've ever read; he takes every clue at face value, tells just about everyone he meets every detail of his investigation and is constantly surprised when it turns out yet another clue was a deliberate red herring planted by the bad guy or whatever. Winslow is repetitive in his descriptions and character backstory too, ultimately making this a quick yet unenjoyable read."}, {"userName": "Dan", "userReviewDate": "Jan 16, 2012", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/999556-dan", "userReview": "Winslow's book is the perfect balm for winter. The protagonist, Boone Daniels, is a laid-back surfer, who does just enough private investigation work to pay the bills. The book is worth reading for the surfbonics alone. For the uninitiated, Winslow will deliver snippets and sometimes even stretches of dialogue in surfbonics, and then, he'll provide the translation. This is a very entertaining read. For those readers familiar with Steve Martini's excellent Paul Madriani series, Winslow's Boone Daniels provides an outstanding contrast. Madriani is a San Diego-based attorney who ends up doing a large share of investigative work. By contrast, Daniels exposes the reader to a different side of San Diego altogether. As a result, the reader of Winslow's fiction views San Diego from a more diverse ethnic, cultural, and socioeconomic perspective.As a result, the reader is not only treated to the hilarious surfbonics but also to a richer sense of the multi-ethnic, multi-cultural, and broad socioeconomic strata that comprise contemporary San Diego. The book has also prompted me to go back to read Winslow's first Boone Daniels novel - The Dawn Patrol. Here's hoping that Winslow's Daniels character has as much fictional traction as Martini's Madriani character."}, {"userName": "Dana Stabenow", "userReviewDate": "Jan 03, 2011", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/1608124-dana-stabenow", "userReview": "Cowboys on surfboards. That's my thumbnail for Don Winslow's The Gentlemen's Hour, the second of two novels featuring San Diego surfer slash private investigator Boone Daniels (the first is The Dawn Patrol). I put \"surfer\" first for a reason. Boone's the California version of an Alaskan Bush pilot. No matter what his day job is, brain surgeon, governor, master mechanic, when you ask him what he is, his first response is always \"Pilot.\"For Boone, the PI business just keeps him in board wax. This time around there's a lot going on in his day job, starting with working for the defense of the worthless little skinhead who killed the god of the beach, Kelly Kuhio, which does not endear Boone to his early morning board buddies, aka the Dawn Patrol. There is the stricken husband hiring Boone to tail his adulterous wife, and the inopportune appearance of Cruz Inglesias, head of one of the biggest and most vicious drug cartels operating on the border. There are distressingly flat seas and disastrous sinkholes and blond bombshell receptionists and crooked records clerks and even crookeder real estate developers and coitus interruptus and coitus finally efficere. Winslow is just one of the best plotting authors around (see The Death and Life of Bobby Z if you don't believe me) and however improbably, all of these plot strands are gathered together and knotted securely in an epic fistfight, on a beach, naturally.But what I really love about this novel is the voice. Here's Boone setting the scene in the first chapter and, not coincidentally, snapshotting the plot as well:...Like water, earth is always moving. You can't necessarily see it, you might not feel it, but it's happening anyway. Beneath our feet, tectonic plates are shifting, faults are widening, quakes are tuning up to rock and roll...Face it -- whether we know it or not, we're all always surfing.Here's Boone talking about surfers going all Robert Ardrey over their beach:It's not that they're just taking his water, it's that they're taking his life. Without that Rockpile break, what he is is a drywaller, a roofer, a karate instructor in a strip mall. With that break, he's a surfer, a Rockpile surfer, and it means something.Here's Boone channeling Skink on real estate developers:Generally speaking, Boone would have every real estate developer in Southern California put on a bus and driven over the cliff, if it wouldn't kill the bus driver. If he can find a bus-driving real estate developer, though, it's on.Here's Boone shopping for electronic snoopers for a case:He already has the camera -- it came with the basic Private Investigator Starter Kit along with the cynicism, a manual of one-liners, and a saxophone soundtrack.Yeah, okay, you've met this detective before, starting with Sam Spade right up through Spenser, smart, tough, outwardly cynical, inwardly romantic, always irresistible to the ladies. Boone is your average, everyday, ordinary knight of the woeful countenance. But nothing says if it's done right you don't want to watch him tilt at another windmill.The day after I finished The Gentlemen's Hour, I picked it up again and reread the ending, just for that epic joust on the beach. It was, indeed, macking.Whatever the hell that means."}, {"userName": "Larry H", "userReviewDate": "Dec 22, 2011", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/5872506-larry-h", "userReview": "There's always an intrinsic coolness in Don Winslow's novels, whether he's writing his series with PI Neal Carey, chronicling the battles between drug cartels, or following a group of surfing friends, as he does in his terrific book, The Gentlemen's Hour. It's a combination of his vividly drawn characters and their often quirky-yet-authentic dialogue, as well as his ability to make you feel you're watching the action unfold in front of you. The Gentlemen's Hour is a follow-up to his 2009 novel, The Dawn Patrol, both of which follow a group of surfers on San Diego's Pacific Beach, which has been rocked by the violent murder of local legend Kelly Kuhio. The case seems open-and-shut: the killer, a wealthy member of a surfing gang, has confessed, and a number of witnesses say they saw him throw the fatal punch. Yet when PI Boone Daniels is asked to investigate the crime to determine whether the charge of first-degree murder should stick, in addition to alienating his long-time friends and the Pacific Beach community, he finds a lot of things to prove the incident wasn't as cut and dried as it appeared. And that's only one of his cases, as he also is asked by a friend to determine if his wife is having an affair. Couple that chaos with a great deal of self-discovery, and it's not all \"hang loose\" for Boone Daniels. I love the way Don Winslow writes, and every character in Boone's group is much more complex than they appear initially. Winslow takes the surfer stereotype and turns it on its ear\u2014sure, these characters are obsessed with finding the perfect wave (or any wave at all) and may fall into surfer speak, but they are much smarter and profound than you think. This is a great book, packed with action and character exposition, although at times it gets a little bogged down in background detail. Winslow did introduce a psychotic villain, who I feared was going to derail the entire book, but luckily he makes only a brief (yet annoying) appearance. All in all, I enjoyed this tremendously, as I have enjoyed nearly every one of Winslow's other books. I hope he's hard at work writing the next one!"}, {"userName": "James Thane", "userReviewDate": "Mar 23, 2010", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/3483907-james-thane", "userReview": "In the cover blurb for this book, Ian Rankin writes that Don Winslow is \"so good you almost want to keep him to yourself.\" Far be it from me to argue with Ian Rankin, but I would modestly suggest that Winslow is so good you want to shout it from the rooftops.\"The Gentlemen's Hour\" is the sequel to Winslow's The Dawn Patrol, featuring surfer/private eye, Boone Daniels, and again, the story is set against the backdrop of the San Diego surfing community. When a surfing idol is brutally and senselessly murdered, Boone alienates practically all of his surfing buddies when he goes to work on behalf of the attorney who is defending the spoiled-rich-kid-gangbanger-wanna-be who has confessed to the murder.If that's not bad enough, another friend believes that his wife is cheating on him and asks Boone to investigate. Boone soon finds himself caught up in the tangled web of not one but two cases, and he seems to be alienating people right and left as he digs into the seamier side of the California Dream, exposing secrets that a lot of people would prefer be left buried. In the meantime, Boone is also trying to sort out the possibilities of a new romantic entanglement and so life at the moment is way more complicated than it should be for a laid-back surfer dude.As is always the case with Winslow's books, this is an immensely entertaining ride.

I love his books, his high energy, straight to the point like a bullet that hits its mark, cool ass writing style. I also love that most of his books take place in and around southern California, I love the offbeat, yet feel very real characters he creates in his books\u2014and this book didn't disappoint one tiny bit since it was typical Winslow at his best. The Gentlemen's Hour is a fast paced, whodunit, but not an overly done whodunit. I almost forget you're reading a full-blown PI book, which is great for me because I'm not a huge fan of whodunits anyhow. I got wrapped up in the characters, the beach setting, the lingo of his writing and the crooked and loyal characters who are just so damn real to me more than I did the mystery aspect of this book. And Boone is now one of my favorite characters I've read in a book thus far. He's just so dysfunctional, yet so cool that he handles it ever so perfectly with a delicate balance that Winslow can write so well. This is the second book in the Dawn Patrol series and I hope to hell he continues on with these freaking addicting reads, characters and story lines!

Hey, I live in San Diego, I'm not a surfer but an ocean swimmer and have the love of the beach thang going, I consider flip flops and board shorts proper church attire..So why am I still so uncool? Then I just chilled and took pleasure in all the surfspeak, recognizing all the local spots (I even got a history lesson or two out of it) and enjoyed it for what it was. I liked Gentleman's Hour better, up until the last quarter of the book, where there were too many implausible twists and turns for my taste, bruddahs. I am especially fond of all the characters' nicknames, Not Sunny as the waitress replacing the irreplaceable Sunny Day, probably my favorite. Would love to see a sequel, or her own spinoff series, featuring the world shredding surf goddess Sunny. Winslow's writing reminds me a little of what I've read of Carl Hiaasen. A good thing.

I had also heard an interview on NPR. So I started with that book, but have to admit it was a little rough around the edges for me, and didn't get too far into it.Winslow is known for profiling the SoCal climate and lifestyle. The Gentleman's Hour is the sequel to his book The Dawn Patrol, but can be read on its own. This book is not as dark as Savagages, but still gives the reader the flavor of life lived on the edge in the San Diego area. Just this edge is a little more approachable to me.The main character, Boone Daniels, is a surfer/private investigator, and is more successful at the first endeavor than the latter. He becomes embroiled in a murder case that has shook up the surfer community, and finds himself on the wrong side of community opinion. He has an interior moral compass, as many of these PI characters do (Spenser, Rockford, ya know) that he must follow, even if those values isolate him.The murder case steadily amps up the action, with ties into land development, Mexican drug cartels, neo-Nazis, and bribery. But I believe at the core of the mystery is the importance of connectiveness, and what will happen to someone left unconnected.The Dawn Patrol is a group of surfers who have hung together on their boards early in the morning since they were teenagers. My guess is they are thirtyish, as the next group to take to the water is called The Gentlemen's Hour, and these \"older\" guys are in their forties and fifties. Each group has a strong sense of brotherhood and loyalty. The one surfer that crossed all lines, Kelly Kuhio, is a father figure in the community. His murder is the catalyst for unearthing the corruption lying just underneath all the fun in the sun atmosphere.Yes, this is a summer read, but it would be good anytime of year. It's a mystery with all the knots untangled by the end, with the hint that the characters keep living after the last page. I have plans to read the prequel, and hope more books come from this author about these surfers."}, {"userName": "Will Johnson", "userReviewDate": "Apr 08, 2014", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/2820455-will-johnson", "userReview": "I looooved The Dawn Patrol but my biggest complaint was that it had an extreme tonal shift that left you a little woozy (insert clever surfing/wave metaphor here).The Gentleman's Hour is Winslow's second look into the Boone Daniels universe and everything is tighter: dialogue is snappier and funnier, the tone does shift but it is a solid progression, the plot is more labyrinthine, sure, but also more intriguing (and, admittedly, less disturbing) and the world is a little more fleshed out and vibrant. Though The Dawn Patrol is pretty perfect, The Gentleman's Hour is ... uh ... perfecter.My favorite part about this thus-far two book series is that the characters really go through changes. This isn't about a particular case/event in which everyone resets at the end. Each action, like in real life, has consequences, and the characters grow (and grow apart) as life moves on. I always thought Winslow wanted people to think Boone was a comic hero though he was really making him a normal guy with cool hobbies. You certainly expect Boone to go one way ... as genre would dictate ... but, and the friends he brings with him, go in unexpected directions.In fact, unlike in The Dawn Patrol, Winslow leaves things pretty open. The 'mystery' is solved but so much of the world is blown open and so many of the relationships damaged that they can't simply piece it together with a bow and call it an ending. If there is ever a Boone Daniels 3, the characters will not be the same and you have to appreciate that creative direction, especially in a genre known for creating episodic adventures.One major complaint is Winslow must have been instructed to give every character a 'previously on The Dawn Patrol' section and it can make the first 50 pages drag since, like me, you probably read Boone Daniels first adventure. Other than that, this manages to build on the success of The Dawn Patrol while also improving it. I loved it."}, {"userName": "Stephen", "userReviewDate": "Jan 16, 2013", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/5321254-stephen", "userReview": "Epic. Macking. Crunchy.There's no other way to describe this book. The Gentlemen's Hour, Don Winslow's sequel to The Dawn Patrol, follows the continuing adventures of surfer/PI Boone Daniels, and is every bit as engrossing as its predecessor.When surf legend Kelly Kuhio (K2) is killed, a local law firm approaches Boone to help with the defense. All of San Diego is out for the killer's blood and Boone is on their side; he wants nothing to do with the case. But Boone's girlfriend Petra Hall (introduced in The Dawn Patrol), who works at the law firm, and his memories of K2 force him to take the case. What he finds is rot and corruption in the city of San Diego and the surf community itself.For a number of years localism has crept into the San Diego surf scene; a violent undertow running at cross purposes with the general spirit of aloha associated with surfers. Boone and the Dawn Patrol are aware of it, but treat it as the exception rather than the rule. But since K2's accused murderer is a member of the Rockpile Crew, a nearby surf gang, Boone has to confront the issue head on.Not only does Boone's work put a heavy strain on his relationship with the Dawn Patrol as a whole, but the K2 case was worked by fellow member Johnny Banzai, a San Diego homicide detective. Boone essentially \"jumped in\" on Banzai's wave, which makes the detective even more pissed. The tension is so thick and Winslow sets the stakes so high that when Boone muses about quitting surfing and going to law school, it seems like the only logical conclusion to the book.Once again, Winslow's style is great, his characters so vivid, and language so real that you'll find yourself turning the pages well after your self-imposed bed time.Highly recommended."}, {"userName": "Jason Gonsalez", "userReviewDate": "Jul 17, 2015", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/11250899-jason-gonsalez", "userReview": "Don Winslow has to go to be up there with some of the greats.

With available work for a private investigator at an all time low, Boone\u2019s life revolves around his regular surfing sessions. While The Dawn Patrol took its name from the early shift of surfers who spend their mornings chasing waves off Pacific Beach, San Diego, a diverse group made up of Boone\u2019s close friends, The Gentlemen\u2019s Hour is a far more sophisticated affair. When the regular working Joes have left the water and headed off to their various places of employment, a second shift of surfers made up of older veteranos and successful entrepreneurs take to the waves.Having nothing to do at the office except watch the bills role in, Boone decides to stay in the water for The Gentlemen\u2019s Hour and is approached by a recent acquaintance, millionaire surf clothing guru and all-round good guy Dan Nichols, with a potential new case. Nichols suspects that his wife is cheating on him and wants Boone to follow her for a couple of days and provide him with evidence as to her (in)fidelity. Matrimonial cases being notorious grubby, unpleasant things, Boone is reluctant to take the case but financial pressures make it impossible for him to refuse it. Boone quickly discovers that Mrs Nichols is indeed having an affair with a middle-aged soil consultant and writes the case off as simply another marriage down the pan. Until, that is, the middle-aged soil consultant turns up dead.Cases for private investigators in San Diego being something like buses, no sooner does Boone become entangled in one case than a whole heap of others come his way. In the course of his investigations, Boone discovers that drug dealing Mexican gangsters are moving into San Diego and decapitated corpses having started showing up. Perhaps even more distressing from Boone\u2019s own point of view, he reluctantly agrees to help his nearly-girlfriend, Public Attorney Petra Hall, with the defence of Corey Blasingame, a rich kid sometime surfer who has been charged with the murder of Kelly Kuhio, a San Diego legend and hero and personal friend of Boone. Despite his privileged upbringing, Corey hung out with the Rockpile Crew, a self-styled group of neo-Nazis, and supposedly killed Kuhio with a single punch. As much as he hates to think it, Boone is having doubts that Corey could really have pulled off the killing.Don Winslow does great crime. With The Gentlemen\u2019s Hour he has created a tight story, comprised of twists, intrigue and darkness yet still full of fun and populated by bright, witty and utterly believable characters. The quick, short chapters allow the action to surge forward and, as should be the case with every great mystery novel, the temptation is always there to read just one more chapter before putting the book down. There is a fair bit of surf jargon involved but it never becomes so technical as to detract from the story and instead helps to inform the personality of the characters and the mood of the location. The Gentlemen\u2019s Hour is a thoroughly enjoyable novel that transports the reader to the sun, sand and surf of San Diego and introduces them to the seedier side of surfer culture."}, {"userName": "Kenneth Iltz", "userReviewDate": "Aug 24, 2017", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/16168486-kenneth-iltz", "userReview": "Don Winslow\u2019s best book (and my favorite) is The Cartel. I was disappointed in The Force, his latest book. The Gentlemen\u2019s Hour is a good read. It is the most recent and perhaps last of his Boone Daniels books. It was first published in 2009. He has also written a series of books about investigator Neal Carey. Winslow says that he writes every day from 5:30 to 10:00 in the morning and then hikes six or seven miles before returning to work. He generally works on two books at a time, moving to the other when work on the first stalls. Boone Daniels reluctantly takes on two cases. First, fellow board rider Dan Nichols suspects that his wife is cheating on him and wants Boone to spy on her. Secondly, lawyer Petra Hall, wants him for the defense of 19-year-old Corey Blasingame. Corey is accused of the beating death of surfing legend Kelly Kuhio. Corey is a member of the Rockpile Crew, a surfing gang with a neo-Nazi skinhead agenda. Boone must also contend with surfers trying to keep their beaches for themselves. The Mexican cartels play a role in the book but I think that Winslow could have written his book without including the Cartels. Nonetheless, he is at his best with the brutal leaders of the Cartels. The title refers to the second shift on the daily surfing clock after the dawn patrol. You need to read the book to begin to understand the hierarchy and schedules of surfers."}, {"userName": "Aaron", "userReviewDate": "Jul 17, 2017", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/3113943-aaron", "userReview": "I should have known something was awry when Jose' Jesus Camargo flew in from East LA to drag me out of school in San Jose', Missourah. Deluded with drugs, denial and near catatonic shock though it just seemed like another weird ride. We did not speak but took a single toke of the polio bud and listened to a mix tape of our favorite songs from the hazy days we all spent in California. We motored down to Kansas City and into the hospital parking lot with the helipad and smoked one last time before we walked like zombies into fate. My brother was in a coma in the head trauma unit and somehow I still held on to the mistaken belief he was indestructible. The party was over and I was the last to know. I often replay that day because many days I pull into the same parking lot for work. I am always reverent walking up to the hospital doors; always aware of the trauma that some of my brothers and sisters are about to face as they cross the street. Pardon my language but these fricking surfer noir books always flood my soul with nostalgic times when mom and later I lived in California. Unfortunately in this post Orwellian world, if I write anything worse than frick I get censored. So I cried, again, at the end of this piece which confirms once more that Don Winslow is absolutely one of the very best of elite, contemporary story tellers."}, {"userName": "Jos\u00e9 V\u00e1zquez", "userReviewDate": "May 20, 2018", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/45251743-jos-v-zquez", "userReview": "Alejado de otras novelas bastante m\u00e1s profundas, La hora de los caballeros es lo que podr\u00edamos llamar una obra \"menor\" de Don Winslow. A pesar de ello no deja de ser entretenida, un pasap\u00e1ginas de esos que se lee r\u00e1pido y de un trago, como un vaso de agua fr\u00eda en plena ola de calor, pero que tampoco tiene mucho que ofrecer.El escenario de San Diego y el surf es tan agradable y soleado que a veces no consigues dejar de pensar que esa trastienda s\u00f3rdida tampoco es para tanto. Y no es que la historia est\u00e9 mal o que los personajes no sean carism\u00e1ticos, incluso tiene sus escenas de violencia extrema con las que Winslow siempre consigue sacudir que contrastan todav\u00eda m\u00e1s con la bondad del escenario, simplemente es que toda la historia parece demasiado relajada en comparaci\u00f3n con lo que Winslow puede dar en sus historias al otro lado de la frontera o en Corrupci\u00f3n Policial.Es una novela, en todos los sentidos, veraniega, recomendable para los fans de la novela negra que quieran pasar un buen rato con un producto que es entretenido y est\u00e1 bien construido pero nada m\u00e1s."}, {"userName": "False", "userReviewDate": "Oct 05, 2017", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/4769446-false", "userReview": "Notes for Me: I'm still reading through Don Winslow's work. There is a marked difference between his earlier work, like this book, versus the later heavy volumes of \"The Cartel\" or \"The Force\" that read more like historical crime novels. It was an effort getting through this one. I don't really care for his protagonist, Boone Daniels--a drifting surf bum who occasionally picks up PI work. Recently I was reading an interview with James C. Hall where he admitted he had never liked his chief protagonist, Thorn, and many a time wanted to kill him off, but as the books became more successful, he felt he was stuck with him. That's how I feel about Boone Daniels. Not very likeable or interesting, yet you're stuck with him. Hopefully, Winslow is finito with him. Epic. Macking.

It pales into insignificance against the 'Cartel', 'The Force' and 'The Winter of Frankie Machine'. One of the attractions in Winslow's novels is his dialogue. It usually crackles along. In this book it was laboured and contrived. The characterisation was not up to his usual standard - characters poorly created and two dimensional. The plot and it's rollout at times was almost laughable - chapter endings with a rogue sentence thrown in out of context to warn you that a major development was about to take place?? Please!One of my literary heros of the crime noir genre disappoints this time."}, {"userName": "Suz Jay", "userReviewDate": "Jan 22, 2018", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/14684876-suz-jay", "userReview": "Surfer PI Boone Daniels is back in Winslow\u2019s great follow up to THE DAWN PATROL.
