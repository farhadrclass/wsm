It\u2019s a good series, however I haven\u2019t felt that real need for the next chapter once I finish the one I have. I can say that I\u2019m beginning to feel that now.The Arrival of Armando really picked up the story for me and I also really enjoyed seeing how the Socoli\u2019s have managed to carve out a life for themselves very similar to how they lived before. It\u2019s clearly not the same but I like that there is an effort to it and it\u2019s interesting to learn more about the other vampires in this would as well. I like that we get to see a more grown up Vanora in this and that she\u2019s becoming her own person, and has some wit to her.Readalong Discussion: ArmandoSo this week we are focusing on Armando and all of his swoon-worthy goodness. He\u2019s dark, mysterious, and sounds damn near perfect to look at. I think the best thing about him is the fact that we truly have no idea what he\u2019s truly up to, is he a good guy or is he a bad guy? We get glimpses of him for both past and present, so we can kind of tell where it lies but I\u2019m more than a little curious to see how he gets to that point."}, {"userName": "Mary", "userReviewDate": "Apr 14, 2013", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/8243269-mary", "userReview": "Finally, we meet Armando!From Goodreads: \"A mysterious new vampire appears in the life of the Socolis. Is he friend or foe? In Darkness We Must Abide is the epic saga of one young woman caught in the dangerous world of the creatures of the night. Already living in the shadows due to her albinism, Vanora is just a little girl when her older brother inadvertently unleashes a terrible evil from the family crypt that changes their lives forever. As she grows up in a world where beautiful deadly beings hunt by night, one captures her eye and her heart. Yet, can she trust the mysterious Armando? For there is a powerful entity plotting to claim her when she reaches adulthood in order to fulfill an ancient prophecy, and her enemy has enveloped her in a web of deceit, casting doubt on all she believes to be true. Soon, she will have to fight not only to save those she loves, but also for her very soul.\"Episode 3 starts out strongly with present day Vanora driving for her life. Someone is after her. Is it Armando or is he trying to help her?We revisit the past and learn how Vanora and her siblings meet Armando. He clearly has an agenda but what isn't clear is if he will hurt Vanora or protect her.I loved the movement forward in this series and think that Armando is a great addition. He is mysterious and I cannot wait to learn more about him. Plus, I know there is so much more coming regarding the future relationship between these two. Are they friends with benefits or more?Vanora's character is growing on me with each installment. Roman is the ever overprotective brother. Alisha, I'm still not sure about.This was another 5/5 star read. Pick it up on Amazon or at the author's website.

Varona is now in her teens and has adjusted well to her new life. Her older brother and sister are now vampires, but they are nothing like the monster that turned them. They are actually quite normal. Things are going well until one night while Varona and Alisha go shopping for junk, she meets a man named Armando. Varona knows he is a vampire and can't help but sense danger around him, yet she is attracted to him. Armando is interested in her as well, but maybe for entirely different reasons. Finally! We finally get to meet the elusive Armando. I am both happy and pissed. He knows Roman is alive and he knows exactly what he is, He wants to be a part of his circle. He is tired of the other vampires and their games and finds it refreshing to be around vampires who still have a human life and are not sucked into the vampire's way of thinking. I won't say more about it, but he has more reasons as to why he wants to be in the Socolis' lives. I am dying to know where this goes since we know Vanora is still talking to him when she is in her twenties. I really enjoy this family. They had me cracking up at times. Alisha is being a bit rebellious with her new boyfriend, Sin. I am with Roman on this one, dating a guy named Sin, you are doomed from the start. But he wasn't all that bad, I must admit. Vanora was a blast. She is fifteen and obviously wants to grow out of her childish ways. When Armando shows up, it couldn't be more clear. She wants to impress him and not seem like a child in front him. But she was a lot of fun. She is one of those characters I would love to know and be friends with in real life. I can't believe where this book ended. I didn't see that coming. Armando apparently isn't the only one who wants in on the Socoli family, well Roman anyway. This was a very interesting part in the book for sure. It made it just that more amazing. These books get better and better. The more information we get with each book, the more intrigued we are. The Socoli family is such a blast. It will be very exciting and scary to see what will happen next. I really want to know what Armando will do and what the Socolis' will do when they discover his secret. I can't wait."}, {"userName": "Andrea", "userReviewDate": "May 21, 2013", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/7371354-andrea", "userReview": "This episode started out so ominous! As with every episode, it starts out with grown up Vanora. Her inner monologue drops hints that something really bad happened with her family once she turned 18, which by the end of this episode is about two years away. As she\u2019s driving home, things seem to get worse. She sees shadowy figures out in a field and when she pulls over, thinking it\u2019s Armando, he calls her and tells her to \u201cdrive. Don\u2019t stop again. Just drive.\u201d Yikes.We are now four years into the future of the flashbacks - does that make sense? Roman, Alisha, and Vanora have pretty much figured out how to make this vampire thing work, with the help of Ryan and Miss Robbins. Roman getting the short end of the stick because he is dead to the world, while Alisha at least as the opportunity to be seen in pubic.This is also the episode in which we meet Armando - obviously - another vampire who claims to have been alone for hundreds of years and is grateful to find more vampires as most vampires live in desolate houses and pretty much keep to themselves. He spends a good deal about of time with the Socoli family and eventually earns their trust and the affections of Vanora (she\u2019s 14-15 at this point). I\u2019m still not sure how I feel about him at this point.Episode three felt more like a filler to me. It was good, don\u2019t get me wrong, but not a lot actually happened. I get it though, you can\u2019t constantly have something going on. Downtime is a necessity. Frater moves us forward in the timeline throughout the episode and everything is seemingly perfect. Alisha even has a boyfriend!There is one scene that gets pretty intense, but it was pretty intense in comparison to episodes one and two. This episode brought on a lot of questions. What\u2019s the deal with Armando? What are his real intentions? What the heck happened between now and our present day scenes in the beginning of the episode? And most importantly: when does the shit in the fan (because I know it\u2019s going to happen at some point)?"}, {"userName": "Jennifer  Ricketts (Donnie Darko Girl)", "userReviewDate": "May 10, 2013", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/6097206-jennifer-ricketts-donnie-darko-girl", "userReview": "Armando attempts to grow closer to Vanora, which set off warning bells for me. What are his intentions? Can he be trusted, or does he have some sort of sinister plans for Vanora and her family? He's suave and an old world gentleman, but there's something underneath the surface that I don't trust even though I like his character. There's a chemistry between the two of them that is undeniable and interesting because it isn't just as simple as a crust - there's much more to it. Vanora begins to grow apart from Alisha and Roman, which really saddened me, but it's an honest and realistic view into someone her age. She's a teenager becoming a young adult and developing her own identity. Already she's mature and intelligent beyond her years. Not only is she growing apart from them as any normal teenager might, but there's also the huge obstacle of Alisha and Roman being vampires while Vanora is not. Alisha and Roman really are more like parents to her than siblings, and the interactions between them remind me of a teenager vs. her parents situation, which led to some comical moments. I really love that about these episodes - there are serious moments, funny moments, tense moments, and sad moments all which make for a story that seems to jump off the pages. The writing is stellar, the characters are ones I care about, and the plot reels me in right away. I'm looking forward to the rest of this season, and luckily, I have episode four waiting for me! ~I received a copy of this episode from the author in exchange for an honest review~"}, {"userName": "Toni", "userReviewDate": "Apr 08, 2013", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/13706669-toni", "userReview": "This third installment was OUTSTANDING! Rhiannon Frater really knows how to draw you right back in where you left off, and leave you salivating for more at the end, just like a weekly television series. Everything about this installment was captivating. I bit off every one of my nails in the time it took me to read it. I want to talk about how much I love what an awesome young woman Vanora is growing up to be, and about how adorable her crush is, but I am supposed to be discussing Armando. Sexy, swoon-worthy Armando with his auburn eyes and dark lashes. His story had a slight Interview with a Vampire feel to it in some ways; the story he told to the Socoli\u2019s, even though he wasn\u2019t being honest with them. I feel like I am getting to know his character, just as the Socoli\u2019s feel they are becoming his friends. I can understand how easily he was able to manipulate them with his charms. I have a feeling that, although Armando has an ulterior motive, he really does care for Vanora, and that he will end up protecting her at all costs, for his own sake, not because it\u2019s what his Master has commanded. I am so excited to read the fourth episode! I want to curl up and devour this entire series in one night (preferably tonight!)."}, {"userName": "Erin Hayes", "userReviewDate": "Apr 06, 2013", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/6816709-erin-hayes", "userReview": "By the third episode of In Darkness We Must Abide, I am fully invested in the Socoli family and the tragedy that has befallen them. Especially Vanora, whom I've taken a great liking to. She's the kind of character that you could find yourself being friends with.Episode 3 finds the Socolis adjusting to their new life, as Roman and Alisha are now vampires trying to live a mortal life with their younger and human sister, Vanora. And then the mysterious Armando DeLeon (from the title of this Episode) shows up. I don't want to give away too much of what happens, let's just say that he shakes things up in the Socoli household. As a reader, I'm very cautious of Armando's motivations because he comes across as a conflicted character.This third episode is a must if you've A) been reading IDWMA serial, because a lot of integral things happen, or B) a big horror fan who loves vampires the way they're meant to be (in which case, go back and read from Episode One).Rhiannon Frater has done a great job of producing a serial that keeps me coming back for - her characters are all very lifelike, including Vanora, who never ceases to make me smile or back her up.

I wasn't sure what to think of him, and as the episodes go on, I am really invested in the characters and the story so I totally don't trust what his motives toward the Socolis. Especially since Vanora got a bad feeling from him when she first meets him.Armando starts to integrate himself into their lives, but Roman being the super protective older brother/father figure doesn't want the vampire around Vanora very much. He becomes a regular in their lives though and is around a lot. Still, though he seems friendly enough, I still didn't quite know what I should think of him. Vanora is smitten with him, but of course she would be. He's an attractive vampire who seems to just ooze charm.Armando entering into their lives changes things a lot and now they have a whole other set of issues that pop up. We get to see just how protective of Vanora not only her brother and sister are, but Armando too.

Vanora is growing older and definitely has some teenage surly attitude going on. Alisha has come into her own and is enjoying her life once more, venturing out into the world often and developing her artistic career and human relationships. Roman is the only one still isolated, but with Armando showing up, their friendship grows and the comradery is apparent.This is my least favorite episode so far. The lingering darkness surrounding the family seems to be somewhat forgotten, and it feels out of place. Even with Armando arriving, he seems to fit in way too easily in the family. The ending of the episode did return to the horror elements somewhat again with the arrival of a new danger, but it felt quickly stilted and the terror was also snuffed out way too quickly and unexpectedly.I hope to find more scary elements and edge of my seat horror returning in the next episode, though I did quite like the mystery of the group that shows up at the end."}, {"userName": "Unabridged Bookshelf", "userReviewDate": "Apr 06, 2013", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/6447425-unabridged-bookshelf", "userReview": "The Arrival of Armando DeLeon feels like a crack in the dam before all the water comes flooding out to destroy everything. As each episode of In Darkness We Must Abide, I seem to be a little more attached to the Socoli Family, and at the end of each episode, I worry about what is going to happen in the next episode. In episode three, there is a strange foreboding feeling throughout the episode. I am now very nervous to find out what is in store next for Roman, Alisha, and especially Vanora. Finally, we meet the stranger, Armando DeLeon who made a brief appearance in the beginning of the first episode. I will admit I have been curious to see how he met Vanora, and how he factored into the story. Episode 3 gives some insight into those details, but keeps a lot more behind closed doors for future episodes. I know as the serial continues those little details will continue to grow.
