This is a subject I\u2019d usually avoid because the word cancer scares me, and I\u2019ve seen what it can do to loved ones, but I was surprised how inspired I became as I read it. The author is a nurse who educated herself with all the facts once she learned her diagnosis. She dug deep into her faith and found ways to nourish her soul throughout the process. I loved all the quotes and the positive way she approached a very scary situation for anyone. She got the help back she had provided in her career two-fold. We were with her during her surgery, chemotherapy, when she lost her hair and her daily walks and prayers. I loved how she talked about sending a card and really meaning the message and how much it meant to her at this time. I was impressed how she learned to let her ego go when she lost her hair, how she embraced each day as a gift, and her husband\u2019s unconditional love for her. These are good lessons for us in life whether we are fighting an illness or not. I ended reading this feeling more hopeful and inspired. This is a book for anyone dealing with cancer or any illness, but it is also for anyone who wants and needs to be encouraged. I highly recommend Ms. Ingalls' book!"}, {"userName": "Harmony Kent", "userReviewDate": "Feb 22, 2017", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/20096235-harmony-kent", "userReview": "Outshine is an Oavarian Cancer survivor's memoir full of inspiration and hope. The author shares her journey from diagnosis to cure and the part her strong faith played in that process. This book would prove useful for those suffering from cancer as well as their caregivers and significant others. One line I love is, '... attitude, acceptance, and determination are important factors in healing the body, mind, and spirit.' The writer learnt many life lessons along the way and shares these unashamedly for the reader's benefit. At the end of the book, the author includes helpful questions, signs and symptoms, and a list of resources.

The book takes you through the journey Ms. Ingalls faced as she first received her diagnosis and fought her way through treatment and healing. I had my own ovarian cancer scare in 2002 but was fortunate that it was not cancer.I applaud Ms. Ingalls for sharing her story and am in awe of her unwavering faith. She not only did conventional chemotherapy treatments but included many holistic treatments as well.This book is of value to anyone suffering from cancer or other chronic or incurable disease. I particularly love all the quotes in the book that help us remember the strength we have deep within ourselves. Maybe because I suffer from a chronic illness few understand, I appreciate her story and the quotes. I have so many of them flagged on my Kindle so that when I am having a particularly down time I can go back and read them for comfort and reassurance that things will be okay in the end.Two quotes that I truly felt inspired by were \"Stick to the fight when you're hardest hit, it's when things seem worst that you mustn't quit\" by Joe O'Keefe and \"We can turn our backs on tomorrow And live for yesterday. Or we can be happy for tomorrow because of yesterday\" --Anonymous.Read this book, I think you will be glad you took the time."}, {"userName": "Bill Ward", "userReviewDate": "Jul 20, 2017", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/23778663-bill-ward", "userReview": "I really enjoyed reading this book which seems the wrong thing to say, given it is about the author's battle with ovarian cancer! I found the book both fascinating and ultimately uplifting. We get all the details of the treatment as well as the emotions the author experiences. It is heart warming to read of the support she received from family and friends, and most importantly it is ultimately a positive outcome as the treatment is successful. The author has a strong faith in God, which has given her strength to endure the tough times. There are some very positive quotes from both the author and others, which make you stop and think about life. It was good to read of the excellent care the author received from health professionals, who are saving lives everyday.

It was educational and uplifting. When I say educational, I found that things that weren't written opened my mind to maybe just as many truths and questions as what was written. You survived a challenging ordeal and you had a wonderful, talented, supportive and knowledgeable healthcare team. I couldn't help but feel for those facing the same challenges who are in areas that don't have access to healthcare. You mentioned the cost of one particular medication (that was - thankfully - covered by your insurance), which led me to wonder about the plight of those with less-than-adequate health insurance (or no insurance at all). It was clear and obvious these were stressful times for you; it's hard to imagine facing all you did AND piling medical bills or the understanding that you simply can't afford treatment that is available [to others]. It's always good to be enlightened to or reminded of the realities of some of life's biggest challenges. I hadn't thought about, for instance, of the significance of fear in relation to cancer. It seems you were fighting your fears almost as much as the disease (not just about your prognosis, but also other aspects of life that one might think of as \"less significant\", like body image - nope...not insignificant at all when you're the one facing the fears). Thanks again for sharing; I appreciate what you've given me the opportunity to learn and think about!"}, {"userName": "Shirley Corder", "userReviewDate": "Feb 06, 2013", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/10914765-shirley-corder", "userReview": "Outshine is so much more than a memoir. Karen Ingalls uses her own experiences to guide the patient through the turbulent waters of ovarian cancer. The story starts with the discovery of a large tumour, moves through the surgery and treatments and on into the post-treatment period. Karen graphically describes the emotional roller coaster, covering points relevant to all on the cancer journey, not only ovarian cancer. In addition to the poignantly-told narrative, this book also includes a list of warning signs, risk factors, discussion points for both the patient and loved ones, and recommended resources.I finished this easy-read book in two sessions, and would recommend it for all women, no matter what their age. Known as \"The Silent Killer\", by the time Ovarian Cancer's symptoms grab our attention it is often too late. Read this book and be pre-warned what to look out for. It could save your life.

This book is the story of Ms. Ingalls's battle with stage 2 ovarian cancer. Amid the shock of the initial diagnosis, she is swept up in a world of increasing uncertainty, of doctors, of pills. Yet, despite everything, she pushes on. Her story is an inspirational one of courage and strength in the face of daunting challenges.It was thoughtful -- and practical -- of the author to include ovarian cancer warning signs, risk factors, and resources in the book's appendices to help those battling the disease."}, {"userName": "Racheal", "userReviewDate": "Sep 15, 2015", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/23582304-racheal", "userReview": "This is an inspiring personal account of the authors experience with ovarian cancer.

There is little greater fear than hearing you have cancer\u2014no matter whether you have a long family history of those that battled the disease or if it\u2019s completely taking you by surprise. Most, if not all, of us, knows someone that has or had cancer. We usually watch from the outside looking in at how the person fighting for their life chooses to deal. Karen Ingalls gives us her firsthand, raw experience with one of the leading causes of death: ovarian cancer.It\u2019s a short book and I finished it in one sitting, finding myself wishing there was more. I couldn\u2019t set it down and I\u2019m amazed at how uplifting people can be when dealing with cancer. For me, this book isn\u2019t just about fighting cancer or even teaching others about the seriousness of the issue. It\u2019s about how she not only relied on her family and friends for comfort, but she relied on Jesus Christ\u2019s unconditional love and grace. As I read through Karen\u2019s story, I could see how her faith in the Holy Spirit grew stronger. Sure, she had her ups and downs, but she\u2019s human. Still, she leaned on her faith, rather than crying out \u201cWhy me, Lord?\u201dAt the end of the book, she listed signs to look for in ovarian cancer (formerly known as \u201cthe silent killer.\u201d) and question suggestions for the patient and their families. I highly recommend reading Outlook: An Ovarian Cancer Memoir. It\u2019s a quick, easy read, tightly and well written.

I was afraid of reading what I feared would be a morbid story of Cancer sickness, but a few reviews of this book convinced me to give it a try. I am happy I did.This is a very well written book full of compassion, love and understanding. The author wrote from the heart and with a strong belief in the healing power of God. If the author survived cancer, it must have been due to those positive actions and dispositions she adopted all through her trial.

For those of you who do not know, ovarian cancer is often fatal. It's aggressive and yet most women don't discover they have it until it's almost too late. Even Ingalls, an RN, didn't realize that she had it. She simply felt she was getting fat when she started unexpectedly putting on weight in her middle 60s. Fortunately for her, she took her concerns to a doctor who actually listened to what she had to say and didn't make a snap diagnosis. (I speak from experience when I say that. I am a cancer survivor who was told by three doctors initially - none of whom spent more than five minutes with me - that I had nothing to worry about. Unconvinced, I went to a fourth physician who then referred me to an oncologist who checked me into the hospital immediately and demanded to know why I'd waited so long to see a doctor...) In straightforward terms, Ingalls discusses her fears, the impact those three little words had on her family and friends, her surgery and subsequent treatment and her faith. She not only describes the changes in her life but also gives readers a mini tutorial on ovarian cancer, chemotherapy and what those who are diagnosed can reasonably expect to happen during the process of treating this awful disease. She also offers readers some useful tips on how best to cope with cancer and the aftermath of a diagnosis, though she's careful to note that these are things that worked for her and might not work for others. She also notes, quite accurately, that if you have been diagnosed you must become your own best advocate. Doing so serves two vitally important purposes: It focuses your attention on your recovery because you are intimately involved in the process and, because of that, it helps you think of yourself not as some helpless victim but as a warrior. That's so important, in my opinion, because any good doctor will tell you that a positive attitude is essential during the recovery process and, frankly, it's all but impossible to have a positive attitude if you think of yourself as a helpless victim... If you have been diagnosed with cancer - any kind of cancer - or know someone who has I think you'd be wise to read this memoir. It's not very long but don't let that fool you: This is a powerful and inspiring book and I take my hat off to Karen Ingalls for being brave enough to fight her cancer and equally brave enough to share that fight with us."}, {"userName": "Kelly Pinella", "userReviewDate": "Nov 06, 2014", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/35348269-kelly-pinella", "userReview": "A true story, Karen battles with ovarian cancer. She gives plenty of details that describe the traumatic experience of conquering this silent killer. Karen finds peace and strength, deeply rooted in faith, in the midst of life threatening challenges. These challenges include the challenge of accepting the news of a 50% survival rate and the challenges of enduring surgery, treatment, and the unknown results. Written in 2012, she describes current medical procedures and shows the side effects of chemo. Each moment with family and friends becomes suddenly valued much more. Even though she is frightened, she seeks help from the Spirit of Christ, who holds a lamb in his arms. The lamb, of course, represents people who seek him. She receives support from her very loving husband, doctors, and friends who send her cards with words of encouragement such as (paraphrased), \"Cancer cannot invade the soul. It cannot destroy peace. It cannot shatter hope. It cannot cripple love. It cannot corrode faith, steal eternal love, or silence courage.\" Get your kleenex out because Karen shares the need to get rid of fear, accept the joy of suffering, prepare for death, celebrate life, and walk each day as a survivor.Very well written. Karen Ingalls is amazing. I recommend this book to anyone with or without cancer because, after all, any day could be our last day whether or not a person is diagnosed with cancer.

You get a true sense of what Karen felt during the different stages of her treatment and there were a few times that a tear was brought to my eye.What comes through more than anything though is the overwhelming love and support Karen received from those around her, most especially her husband who sounds like a treasure of the rarest form.I imagine this book could be of comfort and help to anyone any who find themselves with the same, or similar, diagnosis \u2013 and the list of helpful contacts at the end is an added bonus.Ultimately Karen lets us know that the two most important things to fight an illness like cancer (after the medical help) are your own strength and belief you can beat it, and the support and love of those around you.A worthwhile read"}, {"userName": "Rebecca", "userReviewDate": "Nov 26, 2014", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/34204423-rebecca", "userReview": "Like many other people, cancer has struck my family more than once, so my heart goes out to anyone who has suffered this disease.

Yes, some of the tests and treatments were mentioned but more as a means way to help the reader understand a little more about cancer and its effects not only on the person who has it, but on those who are caregivers. Instead, the book focuses on the hope of survival, the love of friends, and the faith of a believer. it could be read like a daily devotional meant to uplift the reader, especially with the inclusion of spiritual quotes. One quote from the author I found to particularly summarize her ordeal was: \"I did not want our lives to be all about cancer and to have every decision ruled by the status of my health.\" No, indeed.
