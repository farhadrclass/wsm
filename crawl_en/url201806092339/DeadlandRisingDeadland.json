Lovely writing. Great heroine!"}, {"userName": "Shana Festa", "userReviewDate": "May 06, 2015", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/9185553-shana-festa", "userReview": "Okay, so here's the deal. I promised to have this book read and reviewed two weeks ago. Which, if we want to get technical...I did. But being that Deadland Rising is the final chapter in Aukes Deadland Saga I absolutely had to reread it before I could give my final thoughts. Honestly, I'm still not sure how to convey how I feel about the book in mere words.So here's the gist of it. Camp Fox is finito and the group heads for New Eden. Of course, along the way they're hit with a bunch of roadblocks--and I don't mean just traffic jams. By the time they arrived, even though it didn't take up too much time in the book, I felt as if it was a complete tale that could successfully stand alone as a novella. But Aukes trudged on; determined to get out every last drop of story to her readers. Then we're given a treat and hopes of a cure surface. Without giving away too much detail, by the time the group leaves the church I felt as if that hump of the story could have also stood alone as a successful novella...but wait, there's more! Aukes kept going, bringing us to the capitol and introducing a benevolent dictator with wildly misguided intentions. Here I found myself yelling at the characters, \"don't you know never to take candy from strangers?!\" Okay, so they didn't take any candy, but still, they had quite the duh moment and it bit them in the arse. That's all I'll share about the plot, even though there's much more in between and after. Some things you just have to experience for yourselves.Before I get down to the best bits, I want to share the one niggling thing that I can't totally get on board with. The story relays that the virus is even more virulent outside the host, and infection rates increase. Now, I know that a miniscule number viruses can live outside the host on nonporous fomites for up to a week, however after twenty-four hours, it's ability to spread degrades much like a medication's half-life. So, not that I couldn't get past the scientific liberties, because--after all--this is a work of fiction. I just found it pulled me out of the story whenever it came up because my clinical brain questioned it every time. No harm, no foul, though...and it's such a minor gripe that it had no bearing on my rating of the book. I just happen to be neurotic, and let's be honest, I'm no microbiologist, so there's always the chance that I'm misinformed.Now...on to what I really enjoyed about the book. I've been dying to see how Aukes dealt with the two creepy kids, and was elated to find not only them, but another tertiary character similarly afflicted, become their own little arc within the book. In fact I'd love to see a short story about the kids that goes further in-depth with the hows and whys, or maybe even gives a glimpse into their Z-addled brains.I'm happy Aukes didn't go heavy on the lovey-dovey stuff with Cash and Clutch. It would have detracted from the tone set in the previous books and I think she gave readers enough of a hint without making it gag-city.I'm totally a dog person, but let me be the first to say, I definitely do not want to hug any of the dogs in the Deadland Saga...well, maybe Diesel, but not the others (the feral, sickly strays). It stands to reason that domesticated animals would go feral if left to their own defenses, and that most of the small dogs would go the way of the dodo while large mongrels flourish. So it's believable, yet disturbing nonetheless.All said and done, Aukes writes good fiction, no ifs ands or buts about it. A true testament to her talent is that a year can pass and I'll still remember the finer details of her stories. That, ladies and gentleman, is nothing short of spectacular. Even though I received this book in return for an honest review, I purchased a copy because it was just that good and deserved it!"}, {"userName": "Celestine", "userReviewDate": "Apr 16, 2015", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/13928747-celestine", "userReview": "Being a Midwest girl, Rachel Aukes's Deadland Saga sucked me in and spoke to me because I know the cities and landscapes. She has an amazing talent for turning innocuous, everyday places like big box retail stores into terrifying zed zones. I loved the adaptive reuse of the Perkins flag as a symbol of New Eden. The camp meal prepared on the altar table of an abandoned church is a pure literary gem of imagery. The description of bombed out bungalow neighborhoods in Des Moines struck a chord, too. And if you have ever been caught in a bad snowstorm on a rural Iowa interstate, compounded by no plows and no road salt, you know why Clutch & Crew were hustling to get to home base. Compared to Books 1 and 2 in the series, Book 3 was not so focused on the zombies, but the impact of the devastation of civilization on places and people. In true honor to the title, Aukes keeps hope alive throughout Deadland Rising. And then she dashes it, and then hope rises a little, and then she dashes it.... The action is non-stop, and I couldn't put this book down until I finished it at 1 a.m. There is a lot to be wary of in the new world - zeds, bandits, feral animals, illness, decreased resources and power-hungry politicians. You feel the exhaustion seeping out of the main characters.The romantic sucker in me really wanted Cash and Clutch, and their extended family of tag-alongs, to have a happy ending. But in typical horror fashion, Aukes isn't inclined to give everyone the HEA. I'm more of a romance reader, and never met a horror film where I didn't cover my eyes, so there has to be a hint of a happy ending for me to crack a dystopian genre book. The tender scenes between Cash and Clutch are sparse because who really has time for romance when you are fighting for your life and have no privacy? I hate books where the romantic leads somehow find time to canoodle in the midst of danger, and that becomes a pivotal plot point. Contrastingly, the very talented Aukes manages to keep Cash and Clutch the passionate center of the story through little looks and touches and displays of private devotion. She accelerates the romantic tension by raising the question as to whether hard-man Clutch will relent to any future with Cash. There is a sense of doom surrounding Clutch that is tangible throughout the trilogy.Deadland Rising is well-written, highly descriptive, tug-at-your-heartstrings emotional and thrillingly climactic. I think I am going to have to read it again so I can appreciate the subtlety of story now that the race to the ending is complete."}, {"userName": "Linda", "userReviewDate": "May 12, 2015", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/1947477-linda", "userReview": "I loved this series and this book was the perfect finishing touch.

But I can't, and you can't either. We have to accept things as we see them and keep on living.\" -Clutch, Deadland Rising P. 52At the beginning of my other two reviews for this series, I felt the need to explain to my readers that I am generally not a fan of the horror genre. I don't like horror, I deplore zombies, and I don't handle suspense well. Well folks. I'm not even going to write that anymore, because that would be a complete lie. Thank Rachel Aukes, you've ruined horror for me! No longer do I fear the unknowns of the literary world. No longer do I mock zombies, Rachel Aukes has made me a believer.Going into this novel was one of the most bittersweet experiences I have had as a blogger. As anyone who read my other two reviews and read my year end recap could tell you, this was one of my most anticipated reads of 2015, so of course I was pumped to check it out. On the flip side, I knew this would be my final adventure alongside the characters I had grown so incredibly close to. 400 pages to see if these heroes would live, die, or even become the living dead themselves. Emotions ran high, but I knew with Rachel Aukes at the helm, I would not be disappointed.I'll just flat out tell you now that if today was the final day of 2015, Deadland Rising would be among my top reads of the year. I was expecting a whole lot out of this novel and, thankfully, Rachel Aukes did not disappoint, not even a little.In true Rachel Aukes fashion, this entire novel was very fast paced. Picking up mere days after the second novel, we find our characters in quite the conundrum. Making their way across the plains of the Midwest in search of New Eden, their promised paradise and home to other survivors of the zombie apocalypse, proves to be more of a journey than anticipated. It's been nine months since the infection spread rampant across society, resulting in massive casualties and complete breakdown of modern civilization. What remains of the government bombed the metropolitan centers of the US in an effort to kill the infection, killing any possible survivors as well. With the plummeting temperatures of winter quickly taking over, the zeds have migrated south towards warmer temperatures. Those that remain are slow, sluggish, and stand like statues on the frozen plains. While the number of zeds may have decreased, Cash, Clutch, Jase, and the gang must fight off bandits and bands of rabid angry dogs to make their way to New Eden before winter stops them in their tracks. The plot line to this novel is a little more defined that its' predecessors. Unlike the other two stories where the only plot was 'survive', out gang has a mission now. It's a big change of pace from the other two stories where you never know what may happen next, though this novel is full of the unexpected. In true form for a conclusion, Rachel Aukes makes sure to tie up all loose ends. By the time you close your cover, you know whats happened to most all characters. Those that haven't been killed, that is. I'm not going to spoil the ending for anyone, but I can tell you that I was pleased. Immensely. The story wraps up in a way that says \"yes, this is the end of the story, but you never know what the future may hold'. Rebuilding society won't happen overnight, but the reader is left with hope for a better tomorrow.This series has a huge cast of characters. Unfortunately many of them do not make it to the end, but Rachel gives us so many new ones to fill their place. Even though this is a final novel in the series, we are still introduced to a dozen or so new characters that really help to move the story to its' conclusion. New survivors, new doctors, new politicians, new enemies, friends, and animals, will have to work together to survive the end of days in this amazing conclusion. With such a large cast, one may wonder how everyone gets their time to shine. I will admit that I would have liked to have seen more from some characters and less from others, but in the end, this first person POV is told from Cash, who narrates the series to perfection. Seeing the world through her eyes is truly a treat. All of my favorite characters play huge roles in the novel: Clutch, Cash, Jase, Hali, Benji, Griz, and so many more. I'm not going to lie to you guys. In true Rachel Aukes fashion, not every character will make it to the end. There will be feels people. Let's just hope you fight them off better than I did. Oh man, I caught those feels hardcore.The world isn't the same after the outbreak, but Aukes does a great job with her settings in the story. Everything is described in vivid detail, giving this entire series the feel of a motion picture. It isn't hard for me to close my eyes and picture everything as it happens. With the inclusion of some new vernacular and a whole new government, Aukes paints the picture of the future of the Americas where Northern Mexico, the US, and Canada have combined forces into one major state. This picture is far from complete, but gives the reader great insight to what the future may bring.I'd also like to take note of the level of accuracy that Aukes has included in this series. A world without electricity, running water, human maintenance is a scary thought. Many things such as the breakdown in gasoline chemicals (rendering it useless after time) never occurred to me, yet Aukes made sure to include it anyway. Of all the apocalyptic novels I have read, this one is my far the most realistic and I give huge props to Aukes for that. With this series, Rachel Aukes set out to tell a gripping horror story against the backdrop of Dante Alighieri's Inferno, Purgatorio, and Paradiso. Aukes is no casual author, she meticulously analyzed Alighieri's groundbreaking and timeless tale in order to craft her story. Everything is there, from hell to paradise, Rachel Aukes did an incredible job. I have seen authors attempt this in the past with horrendous results, but as a huge fan of the Divine Comedy myself, I can say that Rachel Aukes definitely does it justice. I am confident that Alighieri would be a fan himself, that is, if he weren't stuck back in the thirteenth century. As you can see, I was a huge fan of this final installment of the Deadland Saga. From page one of 100 Days in Deadland, I knew this was going to be a special series. Never once did I read anything in these novels that I wanted to change. Each death served a vital purpose, ever downfall was necessary, and every small victory made my heart soar. Rachel Aukes delivered a stronger punch in her final novel than I even thought was possible. When closing the back cover, I wasn't left with sadness. I wasn't left with regret, fear, or anxiety. I was left with hope. Hope that our world could possibly overcome our difference and come together to form a better society for us all. It should come as absolutely no surprise to anyone that I am granting Deadland Rising by Rachel Aukes a near-perfect 5-star review. Of all my reads, I'm not sure one has ever taken me on quite the journey as this one has. Huge kudos to you Mrs. Rachel Aukes, you truly are the \"Queen of Scream\". I cannot wait to see what we can expect from you next. *********************************************************************************"}, {"userName": "AudioBookReviewer", "userReviewDate": "Nov 30, 2015", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/7365795-audiobookreviewer", "userReview": "My original Deadland Rising audiobook review and many others can be found at Audiobook Reviewer.In an effort to save the residents of Fort Fox from the oncoming hordes of zombies and the harsh upcoming winter, they move their operations onto a couple of barges due to the generosity of another local struggling group. Although greed and thievery create misunderstandings, the zombies still manage to create havoc by distracting the survivors and thus allowing the Black Sheep to board.A large portion of the survivors make it and escape into the horde infested area traversing to New Eden. It is there they begin to assimilate and feel comfortable. New Eden has discovered a possible cure but now they have to go to the new government \u2013 a government with a plan. That plan Cash, Clutch and Jase must stop at all costs.Cash, Clutch and Jase continue to fight the good fight and take care of everyone they can. New friends are discovered and counted on at the new government facility. Try as they might, time is limited and fighting the good fight may not be enough. We are forced to say goodbye to some old friends and new ones.Rachel Aukes continues the saga of the Deadlands with this third and final installment with Cash, Clutch and Jase reaching a satisfying and shocking end. Full of twists and turns, Aukes manages to take us full circle and still keep the surprises coming hard and fast.Aukes sets the zombie apocalypse to the Dante Alighieri\u2019s final poem found in the Divine Comedy using the seven virtues as the theme for a set of chapters. Uniquely done, Aukes has accomplished what many wish to do \u2013 find a new take on zombies and the evils of humankind.The plot was well thought through and executed; the character development excellent. We see the characters grow and change according to age, the situation and maturity. One cannot help but connect to the characters \u2013 you will gasp and feel anger at some of the twists and deaths. Aukes counts on our connection and therefore she handles the deaths in a respectful and caring manner (they may die horribly but they are recognized for their value as an individual and a friend). I did have to laugh as Aukes captured the relationships and played them out with touches of humor that is subtle but if one is observant enough, you will notice the humor.Hollie Jackson did another excellent job at narrating. I love her enthusiasm and ability to keep the readers connected through her controlled voice.The production quality was excellent. I had no issues or concerns.Audiobook provided for review by the author."}, {"userName": "Lindsay", "userReviewDate": "Apr 14, 2015", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/28771939-lindsay", "userReview": "Simply put; I can't imagine a better conclusion to the Deadland Saga than \"Deadland Rising.\" For those of you not in the know, the first book, \"100 Days in Deadland,\" is a modern remake of \"Dante's Inferno.\" The second book, \"Deadland\u2019s Harvest,\" is based on Dante Alighieri's tale of the seven deadly sins and \"Deadland Rising\" covers \u201cParadiso;\" the seven virtues. - I think the concept behind this series is brilliant and very well executed. - Bravo! (I guess this book could technically be read as a stand alone, but you'd seriously be missing out).I do wish that the ending bit, (once Cash reached the capital), had been longer. I would have liked to have spent a little more time experiencing life under President Aline's rule. That part, (and the vaccine trials), felt a tad rushed to me. I also expected something more to happen with the zed kids, (I'm not quite sure what though).Cash's ethnicity is mentioned twice in this installment, but (and I kind of touched on this in my review of the first book too), I feel like more could have been done with this bit of personal info. There were instances were characters reminisced about the past; about food and family traditions that felt like missed opportunities to interject some ethnic spice, (so to speak), into Cash's personality/background. All the Puerto Rican's I know take their food heritage VERY seriously. Easter and Thanksgiving are big holidays for them too. I think a moment where Cash tries to cobble together some pasteles for Thanksgiving out of scavenged ingredients, (or something along those lines), would have been cool. I think a few touches like that would have made more of an impact than the incident where people mistakenly think Cash and Marco are siblings, because Marco is Mexican. - I loved the part when Cash talks about the seasonal equinox feasts that had become a tradition in her family and I wish there had been more tidbits like that peppered throughout.My nitpicky-ness aside, I really adored this entire series. I loved the premise, the story hit all the important beats and I especially enjoyed the realistic banter between characters. My complaints pretty much boil down to me wanting more of a good thing.

Cash, Clutch, and the diminished group of close nit survivors that they call family are working on making it to the promised safe haven in New Eden, to the west of where they have been fighting to survive in Iowa for the bulk of the first two books. New Eden is a fenced in community in Nebraska surrounding an old abandoned missile silo. Marco, last of the squad from New Eden sent out to find survivors, promises to lead the group to safety behind its walls. The first two novels of the trilogy followed the path of most zombie sagas with an equal mix of catastrophe and despair served up on almost every page. This novel follows a slightly different track. The author has modeled all three works after Dante Alighieri\u2019s Divine Comedy, with the first representing hell, the second purgatory, and this, the third book, heaven, or paradise. The seven virtues laid out in Paradiso are laid out as section headings of this book, with the flavor of the third act is distinctly different from the first two. Paradise is more of a wish than reality for the survivors, with the threat of the undead diminished, but never too far away. The zombies have either migrated with the hordes to the south where it is warmer or have started to freeze solid in the bitterly cold Midwestern winter. They are less of a threat and have been replaced with new dangers that are perhaps even more dire for the few living humans who remain. I gave the author credit for crafting massive, almost unfathomable hordes of the undead churning up everything in their path in the previous book. A slow moving, undeniable destroyer of all in its path was a concept I\u2019d not seen used to effect in other zombie novels. In the third book, she takes another intriguing result of a world ravaging plague and squeezes as much potential terror out of it as possible. Wild packs of dogs, abandoned by their owners, have managed to survive by feasting on the dead-devouring the undead they could cull from the herd. Infected with a variation of the plague, they do not turn but have the equivalent of rabies. With as fervent a hunger as the undead and a bite that is equally lethal, they serve as both symbols of fear and tragedy. Innocent, those not destroyed and devoured alongside their masters get to suffer a fate far worse than death, through no fault of their own. Of course, rabid animals are not the only threat in the conclusion to this saga. Facing a brave, or terrifying, new world in the aftermath of the plague is one of the biggest struggles the characters face. What will happen and who will be guiding humanity\u2019s attempts to rebuild are the daunting questions they must face, along with the consequences of the paths those who lead decide to follow. The author does an excellent job of bring this story to a conclusion which should satisfy most readers\u2026especially those who have likely grown weary of what I would dub the \u2018never ending story syndrome\u2019 that is rife in apocalyptic fiction and in other genres as well. Authors who insist on leaving plotlines open and loose ends loose so more of the story can be told in either another trilogy or another book with no promise of completion. Rachel Aukes wraps things up nicely here, with no loose ends. While the author pulled no punches when it comes to how grim things got for the main characters, a spark of hope remained throughout the story, even when it threatened to be snuffed out for good on numerous occasions. The connection to The Divine Comedy is, for the most part, in the background enough that someone unfamiliar with Dante\u2019s masterpiece will not get distracted by it, though those who are familiar with it should appreciate the author\u2019s efforts at sharing the zombified version of a journey through hell, purgatory, and the attempt to rise up into paradise."}, {"userName": "Liz at Fictional Candy", "userReviewDate": "Apr 20, 2015", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/6062267-liz-at-fictional-candy", "userReview": "Deadland Rising completes what has become one of my absolute favorite series ever. Rachel Aukes has written such a beautiful and exciting trilogy, the third book is a bit bittersweet. It has certainly been an eventful ride along with Cash, but oh so worth it. Readers, this is a series not to be missed.We catch up with Catch, Clutch and Jase after they've been attacked by the Black Sheep and are just trying to make their way through the world. They are moving on to a new community called New Eden, and it doesn't sound half bad. As with any new community, you have to worry about who is in charge. Justin is that man. He seems like a pretty good guy, I can't complain too much. Some of the rules are a bit sexist and ageist, but it is what it is. Everyone is doing what they think is best. This place offers a feeling of community, of rebuilding society somewhat, and it offers safety. When you have a crew with dwindling numbers. children, elderly and even a pregnant woman, safety is even more paramount.Can I just say how much I love Cash, Clutch and Jase? They've been together since the beginning and they've managed to stay together. They are family. They are each other's reason for survival and they ground each other when things get crazy. They are all amazing.As I have come to expect, Rachel Aukes delivers the action in spades. This trilogy is near flawless in it's execution. She has given us scenarios that I've not seen before. Everything feels completely plausible and terrifying, and yet I can't get enough. You'd expect with the last book in the trilogy that there would be a lot of just wrapping things up, but it's not just about finishing the story. She continues to bring in the action and heart stopping moments. People are still dying - people who you don't want to see die. People who I thought would make it through. It's really heartbreaking, but I love that no one is safe. Deadland Rising kept me on my toes chapter after chapter.Zombie fans, post apocalyptic fans, and even dystopian fans will really enjoy this series. The writing is fantastic, the plot and storyline are fabulous. The scenery (when not coated with guts) is beautiful.

The real story is what Cash had to go through. The story takes some very thoughtful twists. Add with the first two books, I devoured this one in a very short time. Excellent author, will look out for her future work."}, {"userName": "C.", "userReviewDate": "May 24, 2015", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/32190717-c", "userReview": "So if you like zombies, end of the world scenarios, and kick ass characters, then this series is a must read. Aukes isn't afraid to kill big groups of people in one fell swoop, or even characters you come to love, and it's not just the zeds you have to worry about. Throughout the books, the group of survivors just were trying to find a safe place, but they have to deal with zeds, bandits and even the make shift government. I was glad to see that Cash, Clutch and Jase made it to the end."}, {"userName": "Hilary Chan", "userReviewDate": "Oct 10, 2015", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/16075645-hilary-chan", "userReview": "Those haven't read the Deadland Saga are totally missing out! Ever since I picked up 100 days in deadland, I can't put the series down until I reach the last page of Deadland Rising! The emotional roller coaster and the never-ending adrenaline pump the book offered are simply exceptional! Why hasn't anyone made this into a movie yet?"}, {"userName": "Krystal", "userReviewDate": "Mar 10, 2015", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/2613486-krystal", "userReview": "Fantastic finish to a great series. I couldn't put it down and now I'm sad it's over.As a stand alone book I'd rate this more of a 3.5 or 4 but as part of the trilogy with the overall story it gets a full 5. Overall the tone reminded me more of the first novel and didn't feel overly action packed or rushed as the second often did.I wish there had been more zeds and less dogs."}, {"userName": "Darwiza Guimoc", "userReviewDate": "Feb 01, 2015", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/14242659-darwiza-guimoc", "userReview": "What an EPIC story this is!All throughout the trilogy, I was biting my nails in anticipation on what to come next for our heroes. Ms. Aukes did a splendid job in concluding this story. The moment I got my copy of the book I went right to reading it immediately. I had fun reading the entire series. And I look forward to reading more from you, Ms. Rachel.

When they get to the town, they find their troubles are just starting.Reminds me a lot of Chuck Dixon's comic book, Winter World, which is a good thing.

Was a great end so happy for all concerned. If the author wanted she could continue in the series.
