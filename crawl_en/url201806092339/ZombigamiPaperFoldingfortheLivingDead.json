The diagrams are not at all intuitive. In some cases -- Suzie Gravemaker, for example -- the diagrams seem to skip a step. The hair on the drawing of the finished product doesn't look like the photo.I consulted my beginner's manual, watched a couple of videos, and improvised, and now I can get some of the designs to resemble the pictures.Zombigami is not for origami purists, however; the folds require cutting and recommend gluing.Still, it's pretty fun."}, {"userName": "Michelle", "userReviewDate": "Sep 04, 2012", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/4212445-michelle", "userReview": "Holy heck! Unless you already dabble in origami this book my be okay, but for a beginner like me I was so confused. I even read the beginning that showed the legend of the icons and the basic folds but it still did not help me create anything remotely close to what the book showed. Ruined my birthday! Jk, but almost. I tried to create Susie Gravemaker, a 2 part piece zombie, and I ended up with a botched up flat piece of crap. None of the other pieces looked any easier. Not as much fun as I had hoped :(."}, {"userName": "Meran", "userReviewDate": "May 02, 2014", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/1977270-meran", "userReview": "Folding fun in the Horror Category, 13 zombies.
