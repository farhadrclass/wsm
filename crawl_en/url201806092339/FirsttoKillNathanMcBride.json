Former military guy can investigate without following the rules.I liked the way Nathan notices, analyzes, and talks about details. There a hint of Sherlock Holmes to him. He\u2019s a sniper, helicopter pilot, good at fighting, and wealthy from his security business.Bad guys are dealing in explosives. FBI tries to find them. Bad guys kill good guys. A retired FBI guy asks Nathan and his partner to help as a favor. Nathan does not have to follow FBI rules. He can torture to get information if he needs to. We watch Nathan gather clues, learn things, find the bad guys, etc. That part was good. There is no stupidity. The ending is happy for the good guys.One thing that was weak for me, I would have liked more unusual characters. Something to provide the unexpected. The main characters here were typical FBI and military types. I recently read Mr. Mercedes by Stephen King. He had a 40-year-old woman with OCD called Holly the Mumbler. She did odd and unexpected things - which was the best part of the book. Jack Reacher (by Lee Child) has his oddities with his wandering lifestyle and toothbrush. In comparison Nathan is more normal and typical.For sensitive readers, there is a torture scene at the beginning and some brief torture later. Sometimes torture is difficult for me to read, but I was ok with this. I liked the way the author did it.DATA:Narrative mode: 3rd person. Story length: 364 pages. Swearing language: strong.

I loved the storyline and the book had very memorable characters with healthy back and subplots. Me being retired military as well I can appreciate the research that was done to be as close to honest as you can be in a fiction novel. Now the negative WAY to many flowery words and over the top descriptions of scenes that never caught on. I caught myself skipping 3-4 pages at a time and missing absolutely nothing.. It's almost like the book needed a hundred more pages so it was filled with fluff... Man I hate writing reviews like this, but I have to be honest as I receive emails and questions about my book reviews on a daily basis.. This author has a ton of talent and a great way of spinning a story, but this one missed the mark.....

The main character is a millionaire, security specialist, torture surviving, ex-military sniper. The beginning of the book is rather goofy - Nathan defends a group of call girls (one of which is his main squeeze) from a difficult customer. This encounter does not blend well with how Nathan ultimately shows his personality and abilities when he goes up against the Bridgestone brothers. But, once the main story line begins - when Nathan and his partner finally get their ghillie suits on - the story is very engaging. As snipers, the action is different than a Jack Reacher six-on-one fight but is fun none the less. I have started the second book in the series."}, {"userName": "Arlene", "userReviewDate": "Jun 07, 2012", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/1474479-arlene", "userReview": "I accidentally read the second book in this series (Forced to Kill) first, and while it worked as a standalone, I would have gotten more out of it had I read THIS ONE first.Purely stated, it's a wonderful book.

Nathan McBride is the One. Invincible? Check. Smart? Check. To cut out a lot of checking... Can do everything that anyone in the world would ever want to do but be better at it than anyone else? Check. McBride is an ex-Marine turned super rich business man with ladies swooning at his feet, who is in more demand than Ghostbusters.First to Kill is a decent, if fairly predictable, plot for a thriller. The action scenes are exciting and the story is well written. Like many action thriller protagonists, McBride is a bit too good. And then some. The attention to detail can get a little eyeball rolling at times. McBride doesn't pick up a gun, he picks up a 79mm Smith & Glock Attenuated Groil Snake-Barrelled Piston Hammer with Infra Purple Night Vison Articulated Scope. He doesn't put his shoes on, he picks up his left Horace Gershwin Combat Brogue and slides his Timothy Cooper green stockinged foot into it before pulling the laces tight then looping one lace... well, you get the idea. Jeez, how about crediting the reader with a little intelligence?Despite the criticisms, First to Kill isn't much different to many other action thrillers out there, so I shouldn't be too harsh. I listened to it, rather than read it, and I think this probably improved the experience. I'm pretty sure I'll be listening to the follow up Forced to Kill so I must have enjoyed it really! If you like action thrillers and don't mind rolling your eyes a few times and having everything spelled out, First to Kill may well fit the bill."}, {"userName": "William Brown", "userReviewDate": "Jul 03, 2014", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/5098968-william-brown", "userReview": "5-Stars! A Crackling Good Action-Adventure Story\u201cFirst to Kill\u201d is the first book in what is now a four book series of action-adventure thriller novels from Andrew Peterson featuring the lead character, Nathan McBride. He is a cerebral CIA Special Ops contractor and ex-Marine sniper who is still healing from an earlier mission that went badly wrong. McBride gets called out to help the FBI track down the grandson of a retired FBI director who has gone missing on an undercover assignment to penetrate a radical white supremacist, arms smuggling group. Series books are very much in vogue these days. I usually dislike them, because I feel they all-too-often cheat the reader. To me, a story should be distinct and complete from cover to cover and not simply a teaser to get the reader to buy yet another book. I don\u2019t know how the next three books in the series will work out, but this one is a crackling good action-adventure story. Peterson does a very good job on the two main criteria to achieve that \u2500 he has created a unique, compelling main character, and an excellent, twisting and turning story line. In Nathan McBride, we have a thoughtful, quiet, and very lethal ex-Marine who thinks before he acts. Four a change \u2500 unlike Mitch Rapp, Scot Horvath, or a long list of others \u2500 the bullets don\u2019t bounce off this guy, or anyone else in the story. They get hit, they bleed, and the often die. This isn\u2019t just another action-adventure shoot-em up, it is good well-crafted fiction. I will read more of these, and so should you \u2500 great for the beach, pool, or long airplane ride.William F.

Hands Down. When I said I was looking for a D*** Good Book, I found it! \"First to Kill\" is a heart-pounding, roller-coaster of a thriller featuring Nathan McBride, an ex-Marine sniper and his old partner Harvey who come out of retirement for a private job issued by long time friend Frank Ortega, a high-profile government official. Ortega's son, James, an under cover CIA op, as been kidnapped and presumed dead. Together, Nathan and Harvey must track down those responsible for James' disappearance. As the pieces fall together, Nathan and Harvey find themselves in the middle of a dangerous cat-and-mouse game involving CIA secrets and a dangerous group of bomb trafficking brothers known as the Bridgestones. \"Fist to Kill\" is a beautifully paced book.

Main character Nathan McBride is a confident no limits protagonist, fairly common for the genre, but for all his bluster makes dumb move after dumb move usually resulting in the death/injury of those he is working with or civilians in the nearby vicinity. He is also an avid subscriber to Torturers Monthly despite the fact his \"interrogations\" typically result in misinformation.The author dedicates a surprisingly large amount of time to developing the relationships between McBride and his various colleagues which is admirable in theory, but in practice the dialogue is quite forced and often not very believable.

I found certain plot elements hard to believe, like a 3rd-generation FBI agent blowing his undercover assignment in such an inept way, but that was the central McGuffin at the start of the book. Also, the romantic elements seemed a little forced. As the story slowly unfolded, I was more willing to forgive the writer for the few lapses.

This book is the story of his attempt to hunt down members of a domestic terrorism ring after they set off a bomb that nearly kills his girlfriend. The brothers are both on the FBI\u2019s Most Wanted List and are highly trained and dangerous. \tMuch of Nathan\u2019s past is not revealed until later in the book, but you learn that one of his missions went sour and he was captured in Nicaragua. There he was tortured for days by a sadistic interrogator. Nathan has three massive scars slashed across his face, and dozens more on his torso, made so that it looks similar to a checker board. He is eventually rescued by his best friend, Harvey, but this traumatic event leaves him scarred much worse than the ones on his body. After returning from Nicaragua, Nathan has severe depression and paranoia issues. Harvey desperately tries to keep his friend in a good mental state but it is very difficult. Nathan attempts suicide but fails. Finally, Nathan has an epiphany and gets his life back together. Nathan and Harvey start a home security business and become very successful and fairly wealthy. He meets Holly and they begin a relationship. Holly works for the FBI as their Head Special Agent in Sacramento. \tOne day Nathan and Harvey receive a call from an old friend. This friend\u2019s grandson is an undercover agent and hasn\u2019t reported in nearly two weeks. He was investigating a domestic terrorism ring that deals explosives all over the country. It turns out this friend is actually the former Head of the FBI. He wants to keep this off the books, so he has to privately contact two men he trusts to go and save his grandson. They begin investigating and find out this ring is run by three brothers. Nathan and Harvey raid their compound, killing one of them. However, the other two escape and are hell bent on revenge for the death of their brother. After they find out the FBI and Nathan and Harvey are behind this, they bomb the Sacramento field office, killing 27 people, Holly was nearly one of them she now walks with a permanent limp because of this attack. After their successful attack, the two brothers decide to make a run for the border. They have millions of dollars in cash buried in a remote area. By interrogating of the brother\u2019s contacts, Nathan learns this location and beats them there. A firefight ensues, and despite eating a bullet and nearly being mauled by a mountain lion, Nathan and Harvey manage to kill the two brothers.\tThis book was a very good action-adventure novel.

I love when a story is told by someone whom obviously knows what their talking about. Like this (nice lengthy) novel by Andrew Peterson; the author obviously has either been in the armed forces, or has done a mountain of research. These BELIEVABLE novels are hard to find actually. Believable, AND interesting is even harder to achieve. There is no telling how many stories I started into ONLY to find out that everything is too convenient. Or they write about equipment and weapons only in the barest bone sense. Like one author that kept explaining how her character would \"pull the hammer back on her trusty Glock pistol...??? Almost everyone knows that Glocks don't HAVE a hammer to clock back...Anyway, I have started many, and just stopped right around the one hundred page mark. I just delete them and hope they go away and pray that the Big A doesn't ask me to review them. Well thankfully I found this new series and have already acquired the next two in the series because Peterson is good....really good. HERE'S A SHORT SUMMARY, NO SPOILERS: Nathan is an ex marine s pier. A good one. Perhaps the best. He is captured and tortured nearly to death in a conflict. He, Nathan, was saved barely in time. Years have gone by, and he and his partner own a lucrative home security business. They certainly don't need the money, but every now and then, Nathan and his partner (his partner AND ALSO his spotter from the marine days) take on a mission. It not for money. Not for the thrill. Nathan in truth hates killing, but sometimes their special skills are needed to protect our country against threats that can't be ignored. Threats that can not be handled by official channels. Threats that need Nathan's special sells."}, {"userName": "Josh Smith", "userReviewDate": "Nov 09, 2015", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/19937065-josh-smith", "userReview": "An undercover agent gets caught.

Everything he did was too flawless. It made him an unrealistic character and made the entire book a bit too predictable. Speaking of the entire book; it could have done with a bit less fluff and buff. Everything was exceptionally detailed and I found myself spacing out while reading and after half a page I didn't miss anything. Half a page of details on a helicopter. Another half a page on what he wore that day. Another half a page on him slapping handcuffs on someone. Despite all this I did enjoy the book and I'll definitely read the entire series.

Nathan McBride, the hero of this book, is a damaged veteran, literally scarred by his time as a CIA sniper. Now, working as a security contractor, he becomes involved in a high stakes criminal conspiracy.The pace of these books is very good, although I found there was some general over-simplification of how things work that went on 'off-screen'. There was also a little telegraphing of how things worked.While the main character was complex and certainly not one dimensional, I found that he was curiously naive about issues other than those that would involve a CIA operative. The company he co-owns makes him a mulit-millionaire (part of the simplification mentioned before) but he seems to know very little about money and values it even less.Also, Nathan McBride benefits by the author having all things turn out well for him, at least for the most part. He's amazingly lucky. However, he does suffer a fair bit throughout the book as a counter to this luck so it isn't too onerous.The worst thing I found about the character though is his almost supernatural fortitude. Over the five days or so of the book, he gets about 6 hours sleep gets beaten, shot twice and suffers a double compound fracture but keeps going and can even tell a joke or two.On the whole though, this is, as I said, a pretty good book and is a fun, easy read."}, {"userName": "T.

His use of dialogue was both believable and flowed naturally.His main character, Nathan McBride, however, starts out as someone I genuinely liked and was invested in. However (SPOILER ALERT), halfway through the novel the woman he'd been involved with was injured and a new FBI lady started working with him. And while he didn't overtly ogle her, it was made plain that he seemed to forget all about the injured lady agent he'd slept with and was all about the new girl. I came away from that with the sense that McBride might be a complete asshole! Haha. Which is possible. Fine. I'm okay with that, but it was clear by other things the author Peterson had written about McBride that he was supposed to be less of an asshole and more of a tough guy with feelings like the characters we love in other--similar novels (see my comment about Bob Lee Swagger).In spite of that, I'm willing to give book two a try.
