I love this man.Now let me tell you just how pissed off I am.First of all.Love Triangle.Seriously?In love with both?You met them at the same f*cking time for Christ's sake!Did it occur to you to, I don't know, PICK ONE??I mean you're not trying to find the solution to world hunger.You're not even with a boyfriend and then meet a new guy.No. You didn't know them from Eve, so how hard could it be to pick one and start dating??Killing off Chase.Oh this is my favourite. Let's sum up what happens.The characters involved spend months, and I repeat, months going back and forth. You wouldn't miss the drama and the angst if it were a polka-dotted elephant standing in your room wearing a pink ballet tutu.They were driving me nuts. And then you know what happens?She gets pregnant, tells Chase after such a long time that tested my patience to the point I thought I would explode, and finally everything seems to be going well because they're in love and they're going to have a baby.And then you know what else happens??Yes, that's right  ANOTHER MISUNDERSTANDING.And because of that Chase is killed in a car crash.I stopped reading Taking Chances at this point, because really.If after all this drama, this effort, this incessant will of this man to get Harper to be with him and prove to her that he loves her, this man dies leaving behind his baby without being able to see him grow up, I have nothing else to say.I could care less what happens next.But don't you dare tell me that crap about \"Take care of my family, brother.\"If you think this is romantic, then good for you.But this will be anything close to acceptable when this man doesn't die for nothing and gets to be finally happy with his family.Life has enough crap in it to not have it in fiction as well."}, {"userName": "Akanksha\u2764 S\u00f8ren\u2670", "userReviewDate": "Jan 07, 2013", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/6165339-akanksha-s-ren", "userReview": "[I hated TRIST and HARPER.

But he was like the axe man who kept hitting is own leg repeatedly.He kept pushing her away in the start. He wanted to thrill of the chase.

I'm honestly slacking off in reading this coz as I've continuously said, I hate how Chase ended. I thoroughly hate it. But, of course curiosity eats me up and I can't let this book on his POV slip of my reading knowledge, so finally, I find the guts to read it.Unfortunately, as I'm in the middle of the first chapter, this thought that \"I already know what would happen in the end why I need to read it again blah\" caught up to me, so I decided to skip it all and start on the 13th chapter (its not the last, but its the second to the last, I guess). It's cheating I know, but I just can't bear to go through it all again so I decided better rip it off like a band aid and see how this one would end.So, this is me after reading Taking Chances or better yet after reading the part where something happened to Chase. This is me before I started reading Stealing Harper. Nothing different from my reaction after reading the first because relieving Chase moments are 'nuff to make me feels sad again.And finally, this is me after reading this book...Breaking down, thinking how could someone like Chase end that way? How could he? His last thoughts are enough to make me bawl out my eyes. I'm telling you guys, those last thoughts are so ugh.Dramatic much? But it's true.

I cried my heart out for Taking Chances and I already know Chase's fate and I don't know if I am going to be able to bare reading him tell his side of the story. In a way I wish Molly McAdams would pull a paranormal thing and have him come back because its been weeks since I've read Taking Chances and the novel is still weighing heavily on my mind...

I'm a mess and I can't stand it. This book seriously wrapped me up inside Chase's story and that's that I even tried to read it slowly over a four day period and yet - here I am looking hideous as I try to calm my heart down. Chase has my number 1 spot for book boyfriend and it just breaks my heart knowing that he didn't get to fulfill his life (yes, even fictional characters get to have full lives). If you loved Taking Chances - and you found yourself crying over Chase's demise and you want to get his perspective of how everything went down then you need to read this novel. I found myself crying from the moment I freaking turned on my kindle with the intent of reading this novel. I didn't want Chase to die and I knew starting out that he was going to.

Amazing I know...that doesn't mean it wasn't as heart wrenching as you all think it will be because it is. Mainly the last five percent is the killer but the whole book was like a train wreck waiting to happen. Am I happy I read it? Definitely! Would I recommend for you to read it? Only if you really, really love Chase and just want more of his perspective. I'm not going to do a full book review because this book is basically the same as Taking Chances, so I'm just going to link my review:http://www.goodreads.com/review/show/...Reading over my review, I'm happy to say that some of the problems I had with it being long winded have been fixed. But you can't really read this book without reading Taking Chances. There are just things that are left out of this book that you probably won't understand. So, since this is Chase's POV...I loved it. I loved being in his head and most importantly, I loved finding out how things went in the beginning with him, Harper and Brandon. It explains sooo much!! I was pleasantly surprised to get the more in-depth relationships between Chase and Brad, Chase and Brian, and Chase and his family. I guess those reasons are why this book is getting a higher star rating. Chase is still sooo impatient and quick to anger. Things would have been sooo different if he wasn't always taking off even if he felt he was doing the right thing. Sadly, I will miss him. I still hate how things ended but I do appreciate MM for giving us this book even with that killer ending! BTW...the book ends at sixty-six percent. The rest is chapters from her other books.

I think this was so much harder than reading Taking Chances. I did not expect the end of this, well - I expected that...but not the way it was done. I felt like someone reached into my heart and tore it from my chest. I could barely catch a breath between sobs. For those who have not read Taking Chances...(first read it - get plenty of tissues)...I am not going to not include the details of what happens in TC in this post, so if you want to read TC it is highly recommended to avoid all SH postings. So we all know the story. We all know what we are going to get out of this - and we will all kick ourselves once we are done. Why? Because we knew. And we still read it. Seeing Chase's POV through all the interactions with Harper and seeing sides to him that we did not see just made him more perfect. Okay, Chase was not Mr. Perfect, but he was perfect for Harper. And although I am not a big Team Brandon girl, I was so proud of him for stepping up in TC and after the last page of this book I am at peace with that. But to think that this was going to be less or equally as horrible as TC was on my emotions was completely wrong. Not only did I know the whole time that this was going to happen, after all I already read the damn story. But I was sucked back in and for moments you forget about him dying...and you are cheering for the guy to get his girl and thinking all these great thoughts about HEA...then you remember. And you cry. A lot. I know it is tough for us Chase girls to read this...but it was so good and although I am still having to wipe tears away and will be for a while longer, seeing him in this way was like getting a piece of him back. Sides, scenes and feelings that we did not get to have. These are moments that existed that we missed out on and this is our chance to grab them. Now, even though I am so glad I read this - I still pretty much feel like throwing myself in front of a train.I think I may have highlighted the entire book...but below are sample of quotes... \n'I looked at Harper's mortified expression, and the urge to take her in my arms and take her away from this overwhelmed me. I didn't know where the protectiveness for her came from, but somehow I knew I'd do anything for this innocent girl, and I'd kill anyone who tried to take that innocence from her.'\"Oh my God! Princess! You're my new favorite!\" That's it, that comment right there, and it was sealed. I would do anything to have this beautiful gray-eyed princess lying next to me, as mine.'Good girl, keep looking at me like you can't stand to be near me. You need to run far away, so I can't catch you. Because if I get you, I'm keeping you, and you deserve so much better.''She's everything I never wanted in a girl and everything I wanted from her.'\"...Why can't you just leave him alone?\"\"Because he's with my entire world.\"'There were so many things I wanted to say to her right then. I love you. I want you to be mine.' \"You're special, Harper, it's not hard to love you.\"\"Harper, I will love you the rest of my life.\"'Please, God - please I'll take the pain, just don't take me. I don't want to die. Don't take me from Harper and our baby.' ... \"I'll never leave you - I'll always be with you.\"...\"Tell GB I love him...everyday.\"\n Dear Molly McAdams:So after finishing this - my feelings pre-release have not changed....

Because I'm right freakin' here wanting nothing more than to love you forever.  \nWhen I seen Molly McAdams was writing a book in Chase's POV I was not sure I would read it. I mean I already know what is going to happen it would just make it even more real that Chase is gone by having it in his POV.  But  me being a masochist and all I had to read it..

And that bitch Trish \nI seriously could cut a bitch if she was real. Looking in Chase's eyes and seeing everything that Harper was putting him through made me dislike her so much more in this book then the first one.

I'm glad I read the book just so I could get a better glimpse inside his head. I love Chase more than a sane person should love a fictional character. I am completely heartbroken. It took me over a week to get back to normal after reading Taking Chances. Reading this tragic story from Chase's POV is SO MUCH WORSE! I had extreme anxiety while reading his joy and love for Harper and GB. I kept seeing an hourglass in my mind's eye as each grain of sand slipped through, knowing what was to come. I've never seen a character more devoted to someone than Chase was and then have it all thrown in his face without being believed.

Like unseeing something horrible that is now seared on the backs of your eyelids so that you see it even with your eyes closed. This review is helping me exorcise this book from my mind, though, and I am so done with this sadistic author. I was by turns, engrossed, repelled, aghast, infuriated, and just boggled. That's a lot to go through for a novella of around 150 pages. I didn't realize this is a companion story to Molly McAdams' previous novel, Taking Chances, which tells this story from Harper's point of view (an excerpt was included in my copy). There were allusions to people and happenings that I believe are more fleshed out in that first book and made reading Stealing Harper feel like I started watching a movie from the middle. Anyway, it's not rocket science and I caught on. Who couldn't since this is hardly Romeo and Juliet. These kids make Romeo and Juliet, amazingly stupid impulsive teenagers, look like wise, dignified Nobel Peace Prize winners. I can only pray that people this neanderthalic exist only in McAdams's imagination.Let's start with Chase, our tarnished knight. He's a senior in college in San Diego, but please don't ask me what major he is - the college setting was totally superfluous. He's also a talented tattoo artist and owns his own home that he shares with a couple other guys who share his taste in drink, surfing, and women. He's also our narrator, baring the depths of his soul in the first person throughout this book. Don't worry though, a kitten couldn't drown in these depths. Essentially, he is a commitment-phobic twenty-two-year-old who has never allowed a woman to sleep (as in slumber) with him. Not exactly Prince Charming but he's appealing in a devil-may-care bad boy way. Then, within the first few pages, he meets Harper, his sister's freshman year roommate. Her scorn of his promiscuity has him determined to impress her with his sexual prowess and then toss her aside on her perfect behind. He dubs her \"Princess\" for thinking she's too good for him. Then he finds out she's a virgin who's never even been kissed before and now he has to worship at her feet while flagellating himself for his previous life of debauchery. Oh, and he has also appointed himself guardian of her purity, so he warns away every male who breathes her rarified air. I think Chase is written how extremely romantic women wish a man to be - and not at all how a man actually is. Or if such a man existed, he'd be institutionalized or imprisoned for undoubtedly violating a protection from abuse order.All this respect for her maidenhood doesn't stop Chase from touching her, otherwise manhandling her, and forcing her to accept his \"protection.\" He thinks he doesn't deserve her (after knowing her for about five minutes of conversation) but no one else can have her either. (You know there are Law & Order episodes where people have been locked up for WAY less.) If this wasn't enough to turn my stomach, he rhapsodies that the only two qualities he sees, her \"sweet and snarky\" personality and her smoking body, will make her the object of every living straight man on God's green earth. But even as he denies himself this prize of womanhood, he acts in every way like he owns her, pretty much establishing this book as a modern day rape-fantasy romance. Harper will eventually realize that he is the right man for her after he emotionally beats her into submission, which he does by controlling her life as much as possible and mentally determining what tight clothes she will no longer wear in public. OMG, he is a complete psychopath. This poor girl has no idea what she's walked into. His obsession with her is overwhelming - it comes off the page like a miasma. It's actually the one area that McAdams does powerfully well. She has a knack for creating a lot of emotional tension and then jerking that chain after stringing you out. It's like literary sado-masochism to subject oneself to this kind of writing because in the end, there is no payoff of anything of value.Maybe Chase's behavior towards women is enlightened enough for some readers, but his behavior towards his best friend and housemate, Brandon, is absolutely abhorrent. Brandon is, of course, as hot as Chase and an even better underground fighter (which Chase also does apparently - a gap from Taking Chances). Brandon also doesn't do the love 'em and leave 'em routine, he only has serious relationships and is a stand up guy - the best man Chase knows. They call each other \"brother\" and not in a bro-mance way. When Brandon takes up with Harper - after repeatedly asking Chase for permission since he can see Chase is already in madman/stalker mode - Chase becomes an animal with no loyalties or conscience. He tells Brandon that he won't go after Harper, thereby giving his blessing, and then does exactly that. He can't stop trying to seduce Harper and he baits Brandon into fighting with him EVERY time he sees the couple together, which is every day since Harper just about moves into Brandon's room and strolls around in just Brandon's shirts. I get crazy jealousy, but I don't get selfish stabbing-in-the-back vengeance when you created the situation. He has the impulse control of a five-year-old without a nap.I haven't exhausted Chase, but I will move on to Harper. Her behavior makes no sense with her background - raised by scary, cold single dad in the Marines. She doesn't go all rebellious and drunk and sleeping with everyone - no, she sticks to her values and doesn't let people push her around for, oh, half an hour or so. Then she lets Chase pull and push her to and away from him like a yo-yo because she's attracted to him. The girl lives in a perpetual state of goose bumps. I find Harper more forgivable because she is young and in love for the first time, albeit with two best friends, but given her strict upbringing, she has to know the difference between right and wrong better than this. She helplessly strings both men along while their friendship is destroyed and ultimately everyone is betrayed. The tragedy is that NONE of this is uncontrollable - the choices are in their hands, but they are too stupid, too cowardly, too immoral, too lazy, too passive, too psychotic, to do ANYTHING. Even a bad choice is better than making no choices, Harper. She's the center of this insane vortex of crazy and after asking for and getting plenty of time to figure things out, doesn't make any decision until someone has to hunt her down and demand one. Classy. Maybe even what happens to her (Is that phrase considered a spoiler? Because you so know what happens: the story is as obvious as the plot of a 90's sitcom or an 80's romance.) is understandable to a point, but her emotional range has the elevation of a Midwest plain.So in summary, the dialogue was fun, the characters were strange aliens posing as humans, and the author likes to toy with her readers because having characters learn and hurt and evolve is too much work for her. Seriously, if there are many people like Chase and Harper in this world, humans are better off dying out as a species.Edit:This is not the way I wanted to start a lovely rainy Sunday (all day reading, yay!), but this author seems to be one of a long line of abuse=love New Adult (Who named this new genre? It is the height of stupid.) authors trending these days after the (financial, not evolutionary) success of Beautiful Disaster. I feel sick now and hope this review dissuades even one person NOT to read this sort of garbage. I'm even disappointed in the publisher - I expected better from William Morrow - profit doesn't excuse you from propagating nutters like these unless there is also a black box type warning that there are places to get help if you know people like this."}, {"userName": "\u2605\u2605Sara Lizzy\u2605\u2605", "userReviewDate": "Mar 02, 2013", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/17083195-sara-lizzy", "userReview": "[My head falls forward, and I realize I've closed my eyes again.

I sobbed like a blubbering fool; in the school car-pool line no less (talk about embarrassing) but I just HAD to read it.\u201cHarper, I will love you for the rest of my life.\u201d She sucked in a quick breath but didn\u2019t turn to look at me, and before she hopped out of my truck and away from me, she whispered softly, \u201cYou will always be in my heart, Chase Grayson.\u201dI loved seeing this unfold from Chase\u2019s POV and it only made me love him more\u2026I can\u2019t say the same for Harper but I guess when communication isn\u2019t forged honestly, things get messy. Even with knowing the outcome of the story and trying not to read to the end, I did and it was more awful than I thought it would be\u2026I mean, ripped my heart out, awful, but well worth reading and so good at the same time. Thank you Molly McAdams for breaking my heart twice (and a third time as I write this), it was truly the sweetest, most beautiful pain.\u201cHer eyes were red, her cheeks splotchy, and she looked like someone had ripped out her heart. Me. I did that.

Why I didn't read it? Simply because I know what happens and like one reviewer states even though this is just fiction, the characters deserve a happy ending. I WOULD HAVE BEEN PERFECTLY HAPPY IF CHASE DIDN'T WIN HARPER IN THE END OR IF HE WAS STUCK IN A COMA. However, I still felt like he didn't get his fair chance with Harper and I do believe she really was pulling at his heart strings and cutting them one by one without any care. Don't give me wrong i loveddddd Brandon but I was so teamCHASE that I could NOT enjoy the ending of Book One the way I should cuz I was curled in fetal position balling my eyes out. If it wasn't for Chase I would've just given this book one star but I love him!!!!!! All in all I couldn't put myself thru this shxt so kudos to all my fellow readers who did and survived reading it lol!!2/6/13I'm going to need therapy after reading this won't I?

Stealing Harper will forever be one of those books that I will never read again...ever...! Why...? I don't think I can live through that kinda heart break again. I knew going into this book how it would end, even though I knew that it would eventually lead to Chase's demise...I never thought that it would affect me the way it did! I mean come on I ugly cried almost throughout the whole second half of Taking Chances...this one? I was a blubbering mess when I read the words Chapter One!! Chase is your typical tattooed, playboy bad boy! He's in his last year of college, he knows he's hot and he ain't ashamed of it. His baby sister has just started college and is bringing her new roommate to their annual house party to kick off the school year, little does he know that this will be the night that will change his life forever.Can I say big ups to the amazingly talented Molly McAdams for writing such an amazingly beautiful masterpiece with Stealing Harper.I knew what was gonna happen but I never thought that seeing it through Chase's eyes that I would connect with him on such an intimate level. I shared his highs, his lows, his heart break, his joy, his pain, his desperation and ultimately his demise. I was rooting for him since day one. He was a real asshole to Harper but oh how my heart would ache for him, because after every mean word he'd say to her he would slowly die inside from the regret that he felt from seeing those stormy eyes that he loved so much fill with pain, and I felt like I was dying alongside him. He was so devoted to this girl and he loved her completely and it was a beautiful experience for me to see it through his eyes. *sigh*I haven't stopped crying...ugly crying at that and every time I think about Chase I get all teary eyed. This book was so beautifully written that I cannot express how much I loved it! There really are no words that can describe how incredibly moved and touched I was reading this story. I don't think I've experienced so much heart ache reading a book and I am so happy that I stuck to my guns and soldiered on. Loved it! 5 HEART-BREAKINGLY BEAUTIFUL STARS"}, {"userName": "Steph", "userReviewDate": "May 22, 2013", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/4215697-steph", "userReview": "Okay, so when I finished reading Taking Chances and heard about this book, I swore that I would never read it. Never in a million years! But that was six months ago now, and when this was released I found myself desperate to read the story from Chase's POV. I'm not going to give you quotes or tell you about the ending, which we all know is beyond devastating. But what I will tell you, was that this book was incredible.  I was hooked from start to finish and found myself more and more in love with chase after every word and every beautiful and selfless though that went through his mind. I loved seeing how Harper's choices affected him, and how those actions seemed, coming from the other side or the situation. It totally blew me away and I understood his reasoning so much more. I adored that we got to see Chase spend time with his parents and the way he spoke to them about pretty much everything. They are awesome and hilarious. The relationship Chase had with Brian and Marissa was such a great addition to this story and I think it's a real shame that we only got to meet them now and not in TC. Seeing Trish again was so awful, but it was also enlightening. To see just how differently she behaved when Harper wasn't around. I hated her even more for the disgusting way she behaved and tearing them apart for her own selfish and pointless reasons. I felt so much worse for Chase in this book; he really was completely unaware of what she was doing... Anyway, I am going to leave it there and just say to all of you Taking Chances fans... I know you think this book will break your heart all over again, and I'd like to tell you it won't. But I'd be lying. Seeing Chase and what happened will destroy you, just like it did me. But I promise you, it's worth it."}, {"userName": "Sara", "userReviewDate": "Jan 06, 2013", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/10747133-sara", "userReview": "3 stars means I liked it. I did like it, I didn't love it. I liked Taking Chances, just as it was written. It would've been any ordinary book if Chase and Harper got together after she was knocked up and live happily ever after. Did I want Chase to die? No. But it did make for a interesting turn of events. Like Harper I liked both guys. Brandon was my favorite, I think. He was genuine, thoughtful, loyal and a good friend above all. Chase was a playboy, but he did change his ways after falling for Harper. Chase was underhanded in his pursuit of Harper. He was desperate. In this book, I see his he was tortured. But he also did it to himself. I don't like Chase any more or less than I did before, but it was nice being in his head. My heart ached for him at times. The accident scene was so incredibly sad."}, {"userName": "Laura", "userReviewDate": "Jan 07, 2013", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/7997908-laura", "userReview": "[I thought Taking Chances was sad. This is by far sadder. For the entire book you know what is going to happen, you know Chase is going to die and that is 1000 times more heartbreaking than his sudden death in Taking Chances. Every single time he did something romantic or thought about how much he loved Harper I nearly burst into tears. As it neared his death I just wanted to throw myself into the story and somehow prevent it all from happening.This book will make you love Chase so much more than the first book did. Seeing his thoughts and feelings makes it obvious that he is such a wonderful person which makes his death so much harder. There were several moments were I wasn't sure I could read any more as it was just becoming too much for my heart to handle.I am glad I read it all. It may have been so heart breaking that I may never recover but the story now seems complete. Chase's death scene was the single hardest thing I have ever read and i cried so much into my cats fur it looked like I had given her a bath but it was worth it. It was also worth it just to read more of Molly's amazing writing.

Perceiving how unheroic and weak and hypocritical she is from her own POV was painful. But from Chase's POV, it's excruciating. Especially since the story is just a repeat, and you already know how it ends.All the things I liked about the first book are missing in this one. The family is preachy instead of supportive. Brandon, the truest thing to a hero in this story, is nonexistent. And the writing isn't as strong.I read this with the hope Chase's POV would expose why he and Brandon want this unlikeable girl so badly. Chase is asked at one point what is it about her. His response: \"Everything about her.\" That's as close as we get to learning what drives him. Character motivations are lacking. This POV doesn't add any depth or revelations and I was tempted to skim through most of it."}, {"userName": "Deydra", "userReviewDate": "Jun 23, 2013", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/4886230-deydra", "userReview": "[Acaso Chase no muere?
