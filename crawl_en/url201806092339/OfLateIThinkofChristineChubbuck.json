Her characters are as well developed as ever & there are some good surprises along the way."}, {"userName": "Jaclyn", "userReviewDate": "Oct 20, 2017", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/64167594-jaclyn", "userReview": "I just saw the 2016 movie of Christine Chubbuck, so I was really in the mood for a more uplifting outcome to her story, and this book really delivers!"}, {"userName": "Yuki Burton", "userReviewDate": "Jan 10, 2018", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/75863633-yuki-burton", "userReview": "Perfect timing because I just saw \"Kate Plays Christine\" on Netflix last night. This is a good brief read, perfect for a ride to work. I also remember Hurricane Irma. Is this the first fiction story written about it?"}, {"userName": "Opal Stevens", "userReviewDate": "Nov 06, 2017", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/47770513-opal-stevens", "userReview": "This book could easly be renamed \"Mid-Life Crisis for Beginners\". A local celebrity finds himself on the verge of being forcibly retired from his beloved career. It takes a spooky and sad old VCR tape to send him spiraling into retaliation."}, {"userName": "Wanda Raine Hedare", "userReviewDate": "Nov 11, 2017", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/57499540-wanda-raine-hedare", "userReview": "Anyone see Kate Plays Christine? If you have, you'll want to read this. It's actually the very first book I've ever read on Christine Chubbuck herself, but it's really not about her so much as it's about a weatherman having a mid-life crisis."}, {"userName": "Jane Bates", "userReviewDate": "Oct 27, 2017", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/40767427-jane-bates", "userReview": "Like most of McNutt's works, this short story manages to find a way to be gothic amidst the terror of a deadly hurricane sweeping through Florida. A middle-aged anchorman finds himself swimming out into the flooded streets to make a statement about the ruthless nature of his career."}, {"userName": "Lin Koujo", "userReviewDate": "Oct 31, 2017", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/63165014-lin-koujo", "userReview": "There's a sort of pain and longing that comes with a mid-life crisis. I've got to say it's strange that a nineteen-year-old would be the one to best portray the innermost feelings of getting \"past it\", but this story just really clicks together good to me."}, {"userName": "Jeff Chicken", "userReviewDate": "Oct 08, 2017", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/61370662-jeff-chicken", "userReview": "With Hurricane Irma so recent, this short story is as relevant as ever and tells of a weatherman going through a mid-life crisis, having a mental breakdown after viewing an unusual tape. Will he survive, or be washed away by the wind and water?"}, {"userName": "Bob Morse", "userReviewDate": "Nov 11, 2017", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/42868810-bob-morse", "userReview": "I spent a number of years in Florida, and hearing about Irma on the news was a real sin.

I don't know but it was so cute! Bud was a lovable grouch and his rise against replacement was amazing. It's so current and just in time for the growth of social media in the news industry."}], "description": "It's September, 2017. Hurricane Irma is sweeping across the State of Florida, but for disgruntled weatherman Bud Bradbury, the heavy storm sets the mood for a sudden surge of powerful emotion. After being mailed a mysterious, morbid VHS tape containing old lost footage of something deeply disturbing, he decides that it's time to take back control of his own life... but his attempt to get noticed might just be the most dangerous mistake of his entire career.", "title": "Of Late I Think of Christine Chubbuck", "url": "http://www.goodreads.com/book/show/36242089-of-late-i-think-of-christine-chubbuck", "average": 4.18, "cover": "https://images.gr-assets.com/books/1505439278l/36242089.jpg", "reviews": 15, "authors": [{"url": "https://www.goodreads.com/author/show/7397563.Rebecca_McNutt", "name": "Rebecca McNutt"}], "type": ["Fiction", "Short Stories", "Media Tie In"], "outlinks": ["http://www.goodreads.com/book/show/36242089-of-late-i-think-of-christine-chubbuck", "http://www.goodreads.com/book/show/36225801-of-late-i-think-of-christine-chubbuck", "http://www.goodreads.com/book/show/29992764-danvers", "http://www.goodreads.com/book/show/34432645-perfect-little-angel", "http://www.goodreads.com/book/show/35068995-restless-souls-and-shallow-graves", "http://www.goodreads.com/book/show/35113206-my-wife-eats-from-a-dish-on-the-floor", "http://www.goodreads.com/book/show/32619879-three-little-ghostly-operatives"]}
