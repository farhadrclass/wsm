The kingdom series is brilliant. Not only for the very subtle modern allegories tucked into a generally well written fairytale/fable/medieval-ish story, but this series has two assets that I love:A: You don't have to read them in order. They are very loosely tied together through tiny hints throughout the books. I had many \"ooohhhhhhhhh\" moments when you figure out how they relate. I think this might be my favorite part of the series.B: You don't have to learn a new language, world history or geography to understand the story. It is so brilliantly simple ( north, south, east, west) with characters written in the limited third person. When they don't know something, you don't either, eliminating a ton of unimportant details that usually bog down fantasy books. Characters also dont have intense histories that have to be relayed to the reader. You are right there with them, on their journey , learning about them as you go. The stories are great, twisting and unpredictable. I recommend them to everyone who likes a good set of books."}, {"userName": "Katie M.", "userReviewDate": "Jun 04, 2009", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/882758-katie-m", "userReview": "Innkeeper's daughter, check. Made-up 16th-century England-ish land, check. Implausible romance, check. Okay, so if you're only going to read one Cynthia Voigt book make it one of the Tillerman novels and not this one. But good LORD I love this story. It's everything a completely-un-thought-provoking Anglocentric young adult historical fantasy should be: slightly dark, exciting, hopelessly romantic, and completely satisfying. As far as tropes go, I could do without the childlike-giant-with-heart-of-gold one (a little complexity PLEASE Ms. Voigt!), but really this whole book is about well-executed formula, and it so works for me."}, {"userName": "Beth", "userReviewDate": "May 21, 2016", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/4063913-beth", "userReview": "Ultimately, this is quiet and satisfying, but for a good half of the book, I was wondering why I should care about this story and these people. It turns out that an acknowledgement of the time you're spending on a book by an author you like isn't enough to actually invest you in the story. I wish there'd been more initially: more emotion, more purpose, more direction. Instead, I was left with the uncomfortable feeling that these terrible experiences were glossed over because they were devices meant to function as equalizers."}, {"userName": "Danika", "userReviewDate": "Feb 06, 2014", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/4612919-danika", "userReview": "Cynthia Voigt\u2019s On Fortune\u2019s Wheel tells the story of two runaway teenagers and their eventual return to their homeland. The central character, Birle, is the younger of the two, and she follows the elder, Orien, who is escaping from his hereditary earldom to leave it to his brother. Birle, though seemingly mature, and about to be married, actually seems more childlike than she realizes\u2014she tells Orien of her machinations to avoid the chores assigned by her stepmother Nan or to foist the work on another family member proudly, even when Orien suggests shirking isn\u2019t something to be proud of. She insists Nan treated her like a servant, but it seems clearer from her recollections that her work was merely that necessary from a child of a family that must run an inn to earn its keep, and her subsequent experiences lead her to the conclusion that not only is work a common, but a necessary and desirable part of life. Birle seems to have little affection or concern for her family at the inn, including her father and half-sisters, and never seems to miss or even regret the pain she may be causing them, suggesting an immature level of empathy\u2014especially when, at her return in the end of the book, Nan drops everything she\u2019s doing to go see Birle\u2014her home was a loving one, however she may have felt at the time that the life didn\u2019t suit her.  However, Birle\u2019s role in the story is wonderful. When Orien, who isn\u2019t entirely honest with Birle about the situation he left behind in his earldom, and does as poor a job gauging his brother\u2019s intentions as Birle does with her family, runs cockily off into the unknown beyond the borders of the Kingdom, and promptly gets himself and tagalong Birle captured by slavers, it is Birle who manages (in part through the luck the title contemplates of being purchased by a gentle and well-protected master) to locate Orien, learn of the precarious political situation in the city, and to get them safely out before the threatened invading armies arrive. She learns the information she copies for her master, and thus is able not only to use herbal remedies to care for and heal Orien when he\u2019s dying of the infection in his brand, but to begin to grow her own herbs and dispense remedies after she is established in her grandparents\u2019 holding. Birle, though young and immature, still manages to play the role of a strong, heroic character well."}, {"userName": "Destinee Sutton", "userReviewDate": "Jun 09, 2009", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/90661-destinee-sutton", "userReview": "I just finished reading Tuck Everlasting, which had this recurring wheel imagery and it reminded me of a book I completely loved when I was twelve or so (I was reminded of it just because of the wheel thing--not because they're similar books).

It's not the same cover as the one I had, but I know it's the same book because I remember having a pretend boyfriend named Orien. He was dreamy.

Birle herself was an utterly compelling heroine--childlike, flawed and human, brave, loyal, and loving. Orien frustrated me at times and at times made me swoon. The story itself is exciting and fraught with danger. The romance and its flowering threaded gently through the plot and provided sound motivation.

The characters in this book are amazingly well developed and dynamic and I love almost all of them. This is one of those fantasy books where a lot of time passes throughout the story and I could feel it passing even though it skipped around like crazy when nothing important was going on. It was not boring in the slightest and though the plot was definitely not surprising, at the same time it was because of the emotion and dialogue I enjoyed so much. I love how the main character, Birle, grew so much during her adventures, and the language and setting are so different from what I am used to experiencing in life. It worked perfectly with the story. I loved that. The ending was cheesy and sweet and made me go \"awww,\" but for some reason that fit, and I felt satisfied and happy when I was done with the book. Of course, I did finish it after midnight, so I might have just been in a silly mood. Who knows. I never read the first book in this series, and this book was recommended to me anyway.

I thought maybe I just didn't like fantasy anymore because I've come across so many popular books that I just didn't enjoy, but I think it's more accurate to say that I don't like NEW popular YA fantasy all that much. This feels a bit more like classic YA fantasy of the Robin McKinley era, with a rich full world and characters that don't just feel like modern teenagers running around like actors in a play. The story is smaller scale, more of a quest adventure than The Chosen Special One Who Will Save the World. I marked this as fantasy (and it's probably marketed as such), but there isn't really any magic in it. In that way, this series reminds me a bit of Megan Whalen Turner's books. They're set in a world different than our own (fantasy?), but which feels familiar and almost like a forgotten history from our own world (historical?).The romance is acceptable in this one as well. Yes, there's insta-love that propels the main character on her journey initially, but it doesn't overcome the narrative. We're not treated to paragraph-long descriptions of his rippling abs or bronze skin. She mentions his bellflower blue eyes occasionally...and that's about it. Otherwise, the tale is foremost about their struggle to survive, and the love stuff is more of an after thought to wrap things up. This works for me.The writing also as a lovely old-fashioned feel to it that helps the credibility of the world building. I'm glad I've returned to this series, and I'm going to go on to finish it.

The step down is I think because of the protagonist Birle, who while likeable enough (I enjoyed her determination and hard work and honesty) seemed to fall in instalove with Orien and moon over him for ages for no good reason I could see. I mean he was mildly pleasant, but when the book seemed to end with her getting over him to live her own life I was genuinely pleased. The romance was the least convincing part of the story is what I'm saying. On the other hand, the relationship I really did enjoy was between Birle and her stepmum, with the wicked stepmother not wicked at all, but determined to protect her young daughter from her own foolish choices.

Ok, he is a Lord and it is a different time period, so that seemed plausible. They sleep together the rest of the way home. Then they get back to the Kingdom and Orien easily slips back into being the Earl-to-be hardly ever spending time with Birle --even though she is his betrothed, even though he's been gone for a chunk of time and he's been through some harrowing experiences and isn't the same man, and he supposedly knows Birle really well by this time. (I would have found it more plausible at this point for them to be kicked out because they didn't trust Orien or didn't approve of him marrying a commoner.) Birle, of course feels out of place, she's just exchanging one foreign culture for another, and for some reason now she starts thinking they aren't married, she leaves --even though she's pregnant with his child--, and is shocked when Orien shows up several months later and tells her that they've been married the whole time. Ok, I may not understand all the way the culture works, but she should have. Either she believed him the first time he told her they were married or she didn't. Maybe she got confused when they got to his court and doubted? I don't know, but I still don't think she should be so shocked. Then comes the last part I found hard to swallow. Orien tells her he's giving up the Earldom and they're going south to make a life together. Meanwhile, she's settled in where she is and it even hints that she doesn't want to leave. I found it hard to buy that she could be ok with all the changes in a few minutes. She's a spunky girl with a strong mind, we've seen that the whole book. The end left me thinking they were going to need some marital counseling in a few months rather than be living happily ever after because it still didn't feel like they really understood each other or were looking out for both of their best interests.

Divided into three parts readers realize that she will change from being an Inkeeper's daughter, to a philosopher's amanuensis (alchemist's assistant) to being an Earl's lady--or perhaps not quite. On her journey of self- and world-discovery in this unnamed region with a Middle Ages mentality 14-year-old Birle will receive two rare gifts and learn the treasures of the human heart.Unhappy as an innkeeper's drudge and leery of an impending marriage to a solider Birle sneaks out of the Inn without any definite purpose in mind one dark night. When she surprises a shadow untying the inn's boat she jumps in precipitously--thus making the acquaintance of a handsome young lord--who is fleeing his northern Kingdom but guiltless of any crime. Birle eventually falls in love with him as they share adventures of being shipwrecked, captured by pirates, sold into slavery then separated-after having shared their dreams and delusions with each other.Voigt presents interesting concepts: of compassion in a cruel era, stereotyped women's roles, and egalitarian philosophy to improve mankind in general, for the lot of the People is harsh when compared with the lives of luxury and self-indulgence of the few lords. Her philosopher master, Joachim, teaches her about herbal lore as his great goal is to compile a written Herbal with detailed illustrations to benefit all ailing folks. Birle knows she will never adapt to the life of a Lady of leisure, but also understands that she will never be happy separated from Orien, who dreams of being the best Earl-that-is-to-be for his people. Birle comes of age in this emotional odyssey of danger and spiritual growth as they journey through forests and over the sea. Both Orien and Birle choose different surprisingly paths from the those preordained by their birth--thereby redefining and defying traditional destiny. Despite uneven pacing and curtained sexual activity this book proves an interesting read for older teens. Why no voting buttons?

The writing itself is really good, and I like the character interactions (when they focus on the characters' conflicting worldviews instead of romance), and the world is intriguing... but the protagonist infuriates me too much to continue. The main character's name is Birle, and she is probably the dumbest and most annoying protagonist I've ever seen. Exhibit A: One night she sees a stranger steal her father's boat. Rather than, I don't know, informing someone that there is a strange man making off with her family's belongings, she decides to follow him herself. She jumps into the boat with this man, despite knowing nothing about him, then develops a crush on him almost immediately (even though he could be planning to murder her or sell her into slavery for all she knows). He's actually a decent guy (aside from the boat theft), but Birle had no way to know this. And when this man offers to drop her off on the river bank so she can walk back to her hometown, she makes up excuses because she wants to travel with him. Need I remind you, Birle, that this is the person who stole your family's boat?! It's also worth noting that her family has no idea where she is or when/if she is ever coming back.Exhibit B: Before the events of the book, Birle agreed to marry a man because she felt sorry for him. Not because she loved him, not because she thought he was a decent person who would make a good husband, not because their marriage would provide her with some type of practical or political gain, but because she felt sorry for him and thought \"if I don't marry him, who will?\" This is a dumb reason to marry in general, but it's an even dumber reason to marry in a world where women don't have the right to back out of a marriage. She regrets it later (shocking, I know) and even has the gall to complain about it. The entire time I was mentally screaming \"What did you think would happen if you agreed to marry someone out of pity? You brought this upon yourself, Birle!\"So yes, marking this as DNF because I wanted to stab Birle with something the entire time I was reading it. Granted, I only read the first 80 pages. Maybe she gets less annoying as the story progresses (though somehow I doubt it)."}, {"userName": "Paula", "userReviewDate": "Mar 22, 2009", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/1344896-paula", "userReview": "This is the sequel to Jackaroo, set in the same universe but two generations after the previous book; On Fortune's Wheel is again the story of a young girl from that family, another Innkeeper's Daughter like the last. Birle has agreed to marry a huntsman, even though she's only just of marriageable age, but is getting cold feet. When she spots a mysterious stranger stealing her father's boat, Birle intervenes and ends up travelling downriver with him.The mysterious stranger is, of course, much more than he immediately appears and Birle is determined to go along with him, regardless of what he might think. This is a decision that will ultimately lead to much heartbreak for Birle, who is thrown from a structured society she knows and understands into one where slavery is commonplace. Her companion fares even worse than she does, though there's some resolution for both of them in the end.I have to say, I didn't enjoy this book as much as I did Jackaroo, mostly because I found Birle annoyingly passive. Unlike her grandmother, the protagonist in the previous book, Birle allows herself to be pushed along by events, rarely taking charge of what is going on, while also pining about what and who she has lost - very attractive if you're a teenager, feeling that the world is against you, but damn annoying reading for an adult.

I remember absolutely adoring it and had originally borrowed it from the library. A few years ago I acquired a copy of it to read again as an adult. Even all these years later I still enjoyed it a lot. It\u2019s a solid fantasy with excellent world-building, wonderful adventures, and some romance.The story does move a bit slowly, but the beautiful descriptions and sincere tone to the story match this pace perfectly. As a pre-teen I loved the adventure and romance (I still do) but as an adult I appreciated other things about the story this time through. I really enjoyed how Voigt takes her characters through such a variety of life situations; Birle goes from Innkeeper\u2019s daughter, to servant, to slave, to Lady, and then to farm holder throughout a fairly short span of years. I enjoyed how all of this is spun around the theme of Fortune\u2019s Wheel.I loved how you see these characters standing up for their true selves despite all their trials. I remember as a pre-teen being upset and angry at how Birle chooses her own path at the end of the book; but reading it as an adult I recognize now how much strength and wisdom she shows in that choice. I was impressed at how well this fantasy story has stood the test of time. I also was intrigued by how parts of the story affected me differently now that I am an adult. This is a beautifully written story about finding one\u2019s own path in life and staying true to yourself.Overall a beautiful story and a well done fantasy. I would recommend to those who enjoy deliberately paced fantasies set in beautiful worlds that have some romance in them.

It doesn't do justice to the story!Ok - that's off my chest so I can tell you about the book.The Kingdom series continues. This an intriguing twist on a series - because this doesn't follow regular idea of a series. Instead of following Gwynn in this story - it skips ahead to her granddaughter, Birle. There are definite parallels between the books - at least at the beginning. It's about an Innkeeper's daughter who is supposed to be ready to be married - and has chosen very wrongly!! And then there is a twist.Her path crosses with a strange young lord who is running away from something or other. And that is the start. There is love at first site for Birle - but is it the excitement of the journey or the cornflower blue eyes or the chance for something different or a little of all three? Whatever the draw - they (Birle and Orion) travel together to the edges of the known world and the end of all they know - including their freedom. Along the way they share their stories and their dreams and their hopes and eventually their love. And then they make their way back home - to Orion's home where he is an Earl and Birle is only one of the people. So then what?I really liked this story! I think it was my favorite of the series.

This is a very slow moving story with not a lot of action but more observations of the world around Birle. The characters go through many changes throughout the story, hence the previous title of On Fortune's Wheel. I was kind of expecting this book to pick up right where Tale of Gwyn left off but was a little disappointed to find that it didn't, it takes place a few generations later. I was also a little surprised at how little the way of life and rules in the Kingdom had changed. Birle is an interesting character who doesn't really seem to care about too much the entire story but becomes a rather solid and reliable character to read. I really enjoyed the other main characters and sub characters introduced as well. The message you walk away from the story remembering is also a very good one, finding yourself and standing by who you are and those that really care will stand with you. You also get an understanding about life's up and downs and not giving into the downs.

It is set in medieval times in a land called The Kingdom and follows Birle and Orien and their adventures around the kingdom. I liked this book because Birle was not just a stupid or overly passionate little girl. She was a smart and valued woman. She comes to understand herself and what she wants and what she will do to not only survive but protect those she cares about. Her love story was subtle and quiet. Somehow that made it more real. She knew when to leave and when the tides were turning. She learned what it meant to sacrifice and that it was not a life-ending sentence. She was incredibly strong and just the kind of heroine I needed at the time. I have revisited the book several times and take it with me so it is always on my shelf. It is a book of strength and courage and I love that.Voigt, C. (1990). On fortune's wheel. New York: Atheneum."}], "description": "There are some who say that the Lady Fortune has a wheel, and all men are fixed upon it. The wheel turns, and the men rise, or fall, with the turning of the wheel.\n\n Birle has agreed to be wed to the huntsman Muir as an escape from the drudgery of life at her father's inn -- but the moment she looks into the bellflower blue eyes of the man she comes upon stealing one of her father's boats, Birle knows she cannot marry Muir. Even after she discovers the mysterious stranger is Orien, a Lord and as unreachable to an innkeeper's daughter as a star, Birle is determined to travel with him as far as he will allow.  Their travels take Birle to a world far from home, a world where Lords may become slaves, where Princes rule by fear, and where Fortune's Wheel turns more swiftly and dangerously than Birle could have imagined.  Newberry Medalist Cynthia Voigt's second novel of the Kingdom, set two generations later than Jackaroo, is a memorable combination of thrilling adventure and heart-stopping romance.", "title": "On Fortune's Wheel\n      \n          (Tales of the Kingdom #2)", "url": "http://www.goodreads.com/book/show/95914.On_Fortune_s_Wheel", "average": 4.08, "cover": "https://images.gr-assets.com/books/1388361598l/95914.jpg", "reviews": 163, "authors": [{"url": "https://www.goodreads.com/author/show/7540.Cynthia_Voigt", "name": "Cynthia Voigt"}], "type": ["Fantasy", "Young Adult", "Fiction", "Historical", "Romance"], "outlinks": ["http://www.goodreads.com/book/show/95914.On_Fortune_s_Wheel", "http://www.goodreads.com/book/show/23309586-the-tale-of-birle", "http://www.goodreads.com/book/show/1250148.On_Fortune_s_Wheel", "http://www.goodreads.com/book/show/1812377.On_Fortune_s_Wheel", "http://www.goodreads.com/book/show/29874614-on-fortune-s-wheel", "http://www.goodreads.com/book/show/25712566-tale-of-birle", "http://www.goodreads.com/book/show/2392233.On_Fortune_s_Wheel", "http://www.goodreads.com/book/show/23309589-the-tale-of-birle", "http://www.goodreads.com/book/show/12125.Homecoming", "http://www.goodreads.com/book/show/11831.Dicey_s_Song", "http://www.goodreads.com/book/show/233330.A_Solitary_Blue", "http://www.goodreads.com/book/show/91836.Jackaroo", "http://www.goodreads.com/book/show/327035.Izzy_Willy_Nilly"]}
