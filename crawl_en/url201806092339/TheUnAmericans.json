She has such old eyes.Antopol\u2019s stories have very clear and inescapable hooks; we readers recognize, accept, and ultimately rejoice in her power over us. Once begun, her stories are impossible to resist. We stretch them out, hoping they will last the night, the week. The human element in her characters is painfully evident and we wish to see how someone else would solve the familiar and not-as-familiar dilemmas we face. This glorious collection is a lasting achievement. In \u201cThe Old World,\u201d an aging divorcee marries a new immigrant from the Old World and wonders how he could be so lucky. In \u201cMinor Heroics,\u201d two Israeli brothers show their love and admiration for each other in the rough-and-tumble way brothers do, but when much more than adolescent pride is at stake. In \u201cMy Grandmother Tells Me This Story,\u201d a grandmother tells a granddaughter with a personality too much like her own to dial herself down a notch and \u201cenjoy yourself for once\u2026rather than scratching at\u2026these horrible things that happened before you were born.\u201dIn \u201cThe Quietest Man\u201d an insecure college professor estranged from his wife feels trepidation when he learns his daughter has written a play that will be performed Off Broadway in New York. He is certain it will reveal his daughter\u2019s perceptions of weaknesses in his nature, in his marriage, in his inability to communicate convincingly with her. All these stories have a foot in two worlds: the Old World from which parents and grandparents came, and the America to which they came. It is this wide and long perspective that gives Antopol\u2019s stories their heft and depth and that feeling we get of \u201cold eyes.\u201d She seems to have understood and internalized the conflicts and conundrums faced by those tortured or jailed for their dissent in both countries. In \u201cThe Unknown Soldier,\u201d an actor who had been jailed for his Communist Party affiliation in Hollywood during the McCarthy era is shown to have been guilty only of inattention and shallowness rather than affiliation. His son is not as hard on him as he is on himself.It is difficult to choose a favorite from among these stellar stories, but if forced to pick one I suppose it would be the last, \u201cRetrospective,\u201d which twists our emotions this way and that and ends with a surprise that feels like dread. No matter how kind Antopol is to her characters (who look remarkably familiar in situations we have met before), she does not always give us a painless ending. \u201cBeware,\u201d the epigraph should read, \u201cThere is truth here.\u201d"}, {"userName": "Perry", "userReviewDate": "Jun 15, 2016", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/6354112-perry", "userReview": "All the Lonely People, Where Do They All Come From?\nFinal Short Story is the Best I've Read Since Joyce's \"The Dead\"\n\"The loneliest moment in someone's life is when they are watching their whole world fall apart, and all they can do is stare blankly.\" The Great Gatsby, F. Scott FitzgeraldThe Gatsby quote came to mind upon finishing \"Retrospective,\" the final, juggernaut story in these collected thought-provoking stories that primarily revolve around Jews in WW II Europe, in Israel, as well as communists and the red scare in the McCarthy era U.S. In \"Retrospective,\" Ms. Antopol quilts a vivid landscape for what seems a conventional route for the reader's tour. My thinking while reading it: I know where this is headed, seen a lot of this before. Some turbulence, but I can set her on autopilot; four more to go, take foot off gas, coast; now put right foot easily on brake, and ..... WHAM! It's not a contrived shock ending. I wish I could do justice to this story, but all I can do is say I was left speechless with my jumbled, racing thoughts after a final sweeping imagery that dropped like a boulder on my heart and left me feeling so isolated for a few fleeting moments that I felt my only remedy was my eternal consciousness, hope and faith. That story.... left me breathless.It's the best short story I've read in many years, and the only one, besides The Dead, I can firmly place within Kafka's description of what a perfect story should be: \"the axe for the frozen sea inside us.\". The other tales hit on a wide variety of relationships and a font of differing emotions, the common thread seemingly the character's revelation of self through alienation either caused by the circumstances or their own ego, including:  an elderly widower, remarrying late in life, desperately wanting to belong to an old world culture (and religion);  an Israeli soldier's desire for his amputee brother's love and to be an important part of their family contrasted with his selfish yearning for his brother's girlfriend and his guilt from what seems on track to be much more;  a woman's lonesomeness borne of her fear and the poisonous resentment she developed in being a 13-year-old Jewish girl escaping the Nazis through sewers then living in hiding and nearly starving during the coldest winter ever;  a older man's wounded pride from his lost status in the world causing a painful isolation from his only daughter; a teen daughter's alienation from normal society in living within the narrow world of her father, a communist party leader in the U.S. during the Eisenhower years, and her eagerness to do anything to escape isolation; and,a man's disaffection from losing his relationship with his wife and 10-year-old son due to his self-centeredness.I highly recommend this book."}, {"userName": "Teresa", "userReviewDate": "Jul 07, 2014", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/541416-teresa", "userReview": "Antopol's characters are on the move. They were born in Kiev, Belarus, Prague, the Bronx, Tel Aviv, Moscow and Boston, though they live in New York, California, Maine, Tel Aviv and Jerusalem, with no guarantee they'll stay put. Each story has a political element, as fitting for its time and place; yet, with one notable exception, these stories could be set anywhere: a newly divorced man and a widow quickly falling for each other; a playwright-daughter yearning for her father's approval; a father reconnecting with his young son after a stint in prison.The collection had to grow on me. I wasn't too impressed with the first story and one sentence in particular had me extremely frustrated. (I made my peace with the sentence after I finished the book.) The next two were better, though in each there was at least one phrase that jarred. I started hoping that all the stories wouldn't be written in the first person, wondering if that was my issue. And perhaps it was, because I fell in love with the third-to-last story (there are nine) and then even deeper into the final story, both third-person accounts. Those two are also the longest of the collection and their sentences, full of clauses (which I loved tracking), are as exuberant as the characters they describe.Antopol's stories are full of happenings, but it is the characters that drive them. Her characters are contradictory, finding themselves doing things and saying things they thought they weren't capable of. After horrible experiences, they've changed or they haven't, most change being temporary. They overshare; they don't share enough. They analyze; they're stuck in a rut they don't see until it's too late. They're restless; they're listless. They live."}, {"userName": "Larry H", "userReviewDate": "Feb 06, 2014", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/5872506-larry-h", "userReview": "There was a time when I didn't read short stories, because I said I didn't like getting emotionally invested in characters and plot only to have to move on a short while later. It was a foolish sentiment, in retrospect, one which I abandoned about 15 years ago when I realized how rich the short story landscape truly was, filled with talented authors creating stories with the power of full-length novels, stories whose characters intrigued me and made me long to know more about what happened to them when the stories ended.Molly Antopol's new collection, The UnAmericans, is one of the reasons I'm glad I read short stories. Every one of the eight stories in this collection packed a quiet power, richly drawn characters, and tremendously compelling explorations of human emotion in typical and unusual situations.The characters in Antopol's stories are Jewish people spanning the 1950s through the present. Whether it's the former Czech dissident-turned-New England professor in \"The Quietest Man,\" who tries to find out from his estranged daughter what her new play will say about their strained relationship; the restless Israeli journalist desperate to once again leave her country in search of work, but can't seem to get herself disentangled from a relationship with a widower and his teenage daughter, in \"A Difficult Phase\"; the actor recently released from prison after refusing to name names during the McCarthy era in \"The Unknown Soldier,\" who has reinvented himself to get roles but can't seem to even act the part of good father to his young son; the young Israeli soldier in \"Minor Heroics,\" who finds his loyalty to his family tested after an accident; or the woman recounting her exploits in the Yiddish Underground during World War II in \"My Grandmother Tells Me This Story,\" these are seemingly ordinary people facing challenges that test their strength and their heart.After I finished every one of these stories, I simply thought to myself, \"That was so good!\" Antopol's use of language and imagery, as well as the emotional richness with which she imbues her characters, really makes this a tremendously strong collection. It doesn't matter that I couldn't identify with the situations most of these people found themselves in; I just wanted to keep reading about them. And usually when I read, I'm struck by a sentence or two, something I like to use in my reviews, but there were so many amazing sentences in these stories it became an exercise of excess.I've always felt that a good short story keeps you thinking about the characters after it has ended, and in many cases, you'd be willing to read more about them. I felt that way about nearly every story in The UnAmericans. I'm so glad I found this collection, and look forward to seeing what's next in Molly Antopol's career. I know we'll be hearing from her again soon."}, {"userName": "Jill", "userReviewDate": "Sep 16, 2013", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/2228181-jill", "userReview": "A title such as \u201cThe UnAmericans\u201d begs this question: what is an American? Or more specifically, what is an American in Molly Antopol\u2019s world?A traditional answer might be to have a personal sense of identity and to be unencumbered to pursue one\u2019s most shining hopes and dreams in a land where anything is possible. Molly Antopol\u2019s characters are mostly Jewish and they are mostly alienated \u2013 from spouse or kids, from past ideology and beliefs, and often, from their most authentic selves. Each story is a little gem onto itself.We meet an American actor of Russian ancestry who has eschewed his Russian past, only to leverage it in order win a part with a leftist film director. Fingered during the McCarthy era, he goes to prison in support of beliefs that aren\u2019t even truly his. Upon release, he spends a weekend with his admiring 10-year-old son and comes face-to-face with his hypocrisy.In one of my favorites, A Difficult Phase, a downsized Israeli journalist \u2013floundering in her life \u2013 begins to question her life choices when she meets an attractive widower and his young teenage daughter. \u201cThis is what she was good at: being the blank, understanding face across the table; putting people so at ease they revealed the things they didn\u2019t want to share with anyone, the things they wished didn\u2019t exist at all.\u201dAnother story, The Old World, focuses on a middle-aged tailor who meets and marries a Ukrainian widow, and travels with her back to her hometown, only to discover that he is a poor substitute for her dead husband. He reflects on his grown daughter who is a \u201cborn-again Jew\u201d: \u201cMaybe in religion, Beth really had discovered a way never to be alone. Maybe I am the lost one, wandering the streets of Kiev, competing with a dead man.\u201dOther stories are equally well-crafted and psychologically acute: a decorated Israeli solder comes home and suffers a fluke accident, which sets in play some poignant dynamics between him and his brother. A political dissident in Russia discovers that his neglected daughter has written an autobiographical play with himself as a key character. A young American woman and her Israeli husband must face the reality of their marriage, which is \u201cso scary and real it required an entirely different language, new and strange and yet to be invented.\u201dPsychologically astute, subtlety crafted and haunted, this is a confident and poised debut, which may very well end up on my Top Ten of 2014 list. There is not one mediocre story in this whole remarkable collection. It's one of the best debut story collections in years."}, {"userName": "Julia Fierro", "userReviewDate": "Sep 13, 2013", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/340156-julia-fierro", "userReview": "Masterful writing.

Most contemporary collections of short stories - especially debut ones - don't tend to contain actual stories anymore; they're mostly comprised of individual situations (often very fantastical) which often do paint distinct images, but fail to provide a story to surround them with and interesting characters to drive them forward. There are of course notable exceptions, such as Karen Russell, but they're few and far between. Which is why Molly Antopol's debut collection is such a pleasant surprise. The UnAmericans is a set of real stories populated with real people, linked by the oldest topic in the world - search for personal identity and their relationships with others. However, the stories are varied and expansive, with a real interest in history and personal journeys of their protagonists. An elderly grandmother remembers her youth in occupied Belarus, and reassesses the actions of the Jewish underground resistance; A struggling actor returns to his eschewed Russian roots to gain part in a leftist film project ; A young girl struggles with the life as a daughter of the Communist Party leader in Los Angeles at the height of McCarthyism.No one wants to listen to a man lament his solitary nights, opens the beginning story, >i>The Old World - perhaps an allusion to Martin Amis's famous opening paragraph of The Information - where Howard Siegel a middle-aged tailor and a recent divorcee decides to flirt with Sveta, one of his clients. Howard and Sveta are both from Ukraine - he's left it as a young boy and is now a fully adapted American, while Sveta's left with her former, deceased husband and is still learning English. They develop a relationship and eventually decide to go together to Kiev, the city of Sveta's birth and youth, for an unexpected and sad and a bit mysterious ending to their story. I thoroughly enjoyed Molly Antopol's debut and would definitely read more of her work. The author note at the end of the book mentions that she is currently working at a novel; it's one that I'd like to read and look forward to."}, {"userName": "Lisa", "userReviewDate": "Dec 03, 2017", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/8051792-lisa", "userReview": "The stories in the The UnAmericans struck a chord in me.

So impressive."}, {"userName": "Owen", "userReviewDate": "Jan 09, 2014", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/5429948-owen", "userReview": "According to the cover of this book, Adam Johnson (author of The Orphan Master's Son) describes Molly Antopol as \"a writer of seismic talent.\" After reading The UnAmericans, I could not agree more. Antopol is a master craftswoman of words and her writing is extraordinary. It is so nice to find an author that you immediately love and I can't wait for her to start putting out more stories and hopefully novels. Many, if not all, of these stories are about Israel/Russia and being Jewish/from the Soviet Union. Antopol writes that her family history inspired some of the stories in this collection. But she makes it feel universal, as if anyone's family history can be made into stories such as these. The UnAmericans starts off strongly with \"The Old World\", in which a man falls for a woman, only to learn she may have been mistaken in marrying him. Each story in this collection is like that, with potential tragedy and deep emotions. However, there is also humor and lightheartedness as well which creates a nice balance.I guess I would say that the theme of this collection is what it is like being human and experiencing life. Although the stories feature characters who are Jewish and/or Eastern European, anyone could enjoy this collection. Antopol creates plausible scenarios, realistic problems, and natural-sounding dialogue. The UnAmericans is fairly short and a quick read, but I know I will go back and reread these stories, finding more each time I revisit them. It is hard to express how satisfied I am after reading this. Of course, it has some flaws but that only makes it better. I did not love every story but I got something out of each one, and for the first time in a long time after reading fiction, I feel like Antopol's characters, the \"UnAmericans\", could be real people. And not just because they resemble her family members. All of them are ordinary people and each has a story, things like whether they were part of the Communist party or had lost someone they really cared about. I am rarely optimistic about anything but, I don't know, this book kind of made me feel good. Sure there are bad parts and a lot of sadness, but the aspects of family and perseverance and recreation were a nice break from the dark, depressing books I often read. There is still so much to be said about this collection of short stories but I will let the book speak for itself. The UnAmericans is the best book I've read in a while and it became an instant favorite of mine and I could not recommend it highly enough."}, {"userName": "Douglas", "userReviewDate": "Nov 19, 2013", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/3020662-douglas", "userReview": "Exceptional collection by a very talented writer. I think my favorite story was \"My Grandmother Tells Me This Story\". I can see the comparisons to Philip Roth in some of these. I think there were a couple of moments that could've been better.

I am usually not a fan of short story collections, as I find it difficult to switch gears between stories. For this book, each story was so self-contained and well-written that I didn't mind - but I did have to pause between each story to really let them sink in. My favorite of the book is probably \"Retrospective,\" the last story, in which an Israeli man is forced to reconsider his marriage once his wife's grandmother dies. I also loved \"The Quietest Man,\" where an absentee father finds out that his daughter is writing a play about their family, and \"A Difficult Phase,\" in which a journalist attempts to disentangle herself from a widower she's dating and his teenage daughter. But really, all of these are very good, with gorgeous writing and strong characterization. Molly Antopol can jump from a teenage girl escaping the Nazis to an older, divorced man who runs a dry cleaning business in New York without breaking a sweat.Adam Johnson is quoted on this book as saying, \"A writer of seismic talent,\" which is the kind of thing that normally makes me roll my eyes. In this case, it's totally warranted: Molly Antopol is a writer of seismic talent.

These are stories told over coffee at the local deli, elbows on the table and bagel crumbs on the plate, or at night after dinner, while the coffee brews. There\u2019s a sense of oral history here which is quite beguiling, but also, because Antopol is skilled, of the way the stories we tell reveal more about who we are than about actual events.The success of this approach varies from story to story and Antopol is strongest when political strife forms the backdrop. Novak of \"The Quietest Man\" embroiders his political past in Communist Czechoslovakia for his daughter\u2019s play based on his life. \"Duck and Cover\" tells a story of McCarthy-era sexual awakening which would earn an approving nod from the likes of Margaret Atwood. In others \u2014 \"Minor Heroics\" and \"A Difficult Phase\", both set in modern Israel \u2014 she is less surefooted. The strife exists, we all know that, but it\u2019s almost invisible here, and without the sense of wider oppression and discord to focus the action, her stories tend to ramble.That said this is an assured debut from a writer with talent and energy.

I was a bit disappointed by this collection, though. I feel a little out of place with my three-star review after perusing the many, many four- and five-star ratings here, but I'm sticking with my initial reaction. My basic problem with the collection was not with the writing, which, sentence to sentence, was excellent. I found Antopol's stories inconsistent in terms of character development and relatability, which meant that, while reading several of the stories, I found myself bored and unengaged, despite the marvelous descriptions of setting. There is a lot of good work in this collection. Some of the stories, like My Grandmother Tells Me This Story, about Eastern European Jewish refugees during World War II, are gripping and vivid. Others, though, like Duck and Cover, about communists in Southern California during the McCarthy area, left me completely cold. All of the stories feature Jewish protagonists, many of whom are struggling with questions of identity \u2013 religious, national, familial, or otherwise. These are broad questions and provide fertile ground for interesting storytelling, and sometimes, Antopol nails it. But the stories varied too widely for me to wholeheartedly recommend this book."}, {"userName": "Carl R.", "userReviewDate": "Mar 05, 2014", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/9314075-carl-r", "userReview": "Not since Edith Pearlman\u2019s Binocular Vision, have I read a set of stories that so captured the heart of immigrant and ex-pat America. I don\u2019t mean to belittle Molly Antopol by saying that her The UnAmericans doesn\u2019t quite measure up to Pearlman\u2019s work. She\u2019s so very young, after all, having just received an award for under-35\u2032ers, and she has a long time to develop her prodigious talent. Plus, I haven\u2019t read any collection by anybody save maybe Munro or Chekov that compares with Pearlman. However, Antopol both in subject matter and impact does approach the quality of Binocular Vision. I always have trouble reviewing short story collections because it seems one has to pick either a favorite or a couple of single stories that typify the whole. Which seems sort of like picking favorite chapters from a novel. But, gun to my head, I\u2019d have to point to the opening story \u201cThe Old World\u201d about a widower who falls in love with a Ukrainian woman. It\u2019s rather remarkable that Antopol\u2019s able to get these two oldsters right, given her youth. But she does. And we end up in Kiev (how many post-Tolstoy stories go there?) for a sad and mysterious ending that\u2019s well and truly drawn.And skipping all the way to the end, you\u2019ll have a hard time beating \u201cRetrospective\u201d about a fresh marriage between a couple of Americans with close ties to Israel who go to Jerusalem to help settle the estate of the wife\u2019s grandmother. The ending is one of those surprising, yet inevitable moments of anagnorisis that leaves you nearly breathless.And thought she proves herself more than proficient in creating male protagonists, women get their due as well. Talia in \u201cA Difficult Phase\u201d pulls us into what is literally a very thorny situation, and we\u2019re never sure whether she escapes or not.Just a sample, inadequately described.

The good: I like the concept \u2013 stories about contemporary Jewish life, about alienation and despondency. (The title is a clever play on this, but in the end, somewhat distracting and unintentionally political, I believe.) I love how quickly Antopol was able to establish character and setting, often within a couple key sentences. That\u2019s an incredible skill. There were a couple seminal moments in this book that were so beautifully described, that felt so specific and real to me. I\u2019m thinking of the expatriate returning to post-Socialist Kiev. The angry grandmother trying to correct her granddaughter\u2019s assumptions. The 30-year-old journalist coping with her professional failure. If I read any of these stories individually in the New Yorker, I\u2019d be a big fan. So what\u2019s the problem? 5 of the 8 stories were essentially about the same thing: public heroes and their private failures. The other 3 were also thematically overlapping: about the loss of one\u2019s rooting or home. The lack of diversity in this collection took away from each individual story and made the collection somewhat tedious. Just the same thing over and over again. It\u2019s really unfortunate."}, {"userName": "Emily Simpson", "userReviewDate": "Feb 21, 2014", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/1930541-emily-simpson", "userReview": "Admission: This rating has far less to do with the quality of sentences or sentiments in the collection (it's very well written), and more to do with my exhaustion with the subject matter.

I struggled with the rating on this one because I enjoyed reading the stories as stories, and found them full of interesting insights. At the same time, that this was done so well made it more important to me that it was possible for the author to create a representation of Israel from which Palestinians are so completely absent. It's a perfect fantasy in a time where the justification for this state's existence hangs on the belief in this very fantasy version of the state. That the Palestinians just don't exist makes the stories of Israel a window into the Zionist worldview and mythology: making the desert bloom, enjoying the seaside, but never noticing or acknowledging an ongoing staggering human rights crisis. The memory of the Holocaust is ever present, but the reality of Palestinians is not acknowledged. In an interview with the Rumpus, Antopol commented that she didn't want to engage the \"Arab-Israeli\" question because she didn't want to make the novel about politics. However, with this avoidance, she did not avoid politics, so much as erase an entire people. I was interested in this novel because of the HUAC stories, but I also found these to be the least interesting of the bunch, not capturing the time period or the characters especially well."}, {"userName": "Lavinia", "userReviewDate": "Sep 05, 2017", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/1405967-lavinia", "userReview": "Molly, what a nice surprise!"}, {"userName": "Sasha", "userReviewDate": "May 20, 2017", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/5066755-sasha", "userReview": "\u201cBut there was no denying how painful it was to be in a family that had always seemed so confused by her for stubbornly studying the languages of all the places they\u2019d never go, as if it were some geeky form of rebellion, rather than what learning them had always been to her, a shield against loneliness.\u201d\"Maybe her need to travel, to hear other people\u2019s stories, to make a name for herself\u2014maybe it had never been ambition and curiosity that drove her but the plain and simple fear that she wouldn\u2019t know how to face real life.\"Oof.

These stories, delicate and brutal, all about the Jewish experience in America, in Israel, in Ukraine, all touch on cultural and psychological truths that push past any sort of insular boundaries. The strongest of the stories here, one about a father dealing with his daughter writing a play about his life, dives into the selfishness and egotism of the main character without sacrificing the sympathy that we build toward him: his narcissism disgusts us, but it is through this narcissism that we access his insecurity and humanity. The weaker tales treat their main characters more gently, but still deliver on moments that prod your guts, making you turn the page.

This is the best short story collection I've read in ages. The stories travel through history and place to explore characters from different cultures but alike in their humanity. Her descriptions of emotional experience were so compelling I read them over and over again. A man and a young woman meet in a coffee shop and have an affair. The man is grieving his wife, and the woman sees in moments so lost in a moment, that she understands his dislocation - his wife is gone, he is lost - and she moves towards him. We meet fathers and daughters, lovers, grand parents, and other characters working to connect, to understand each other, and often to survive.I highly recommend this book."}], "description": "The UnAmericans, a stunning exploration of characters shaped by the forces of history, is the debut work of fiction by Molly Antopol, a 2013 National Book Foundation \"5 Under 35\" Honoree. An absentee father, a former dissident from communist-era Prague, needles his adult daughter for details about her newly commissioned play when he fears it will cast him in an unflattering light. An actor, imprisoned during the Red Scare for playing up his communist leanings to get a part with a leftist film director, is shamed by his act when he reunites with his precocious young son. An Israeli soldier, forced to defend a settlement filled with American religious families, still pines for a chance to discover the United States for himself. A young Israeli journalist, left unemployed after America's most recent economic crash, questions her life path when she begins dating a middle-aged widower still in mourning for his wife. And in the book's final story, a tour de force spanning three continents and three generations of women, a young American and her Israeli husband are forced to reconsider their marriage after the death of her dissident art-collecting grandmother. Again and again, Molly Antopol's deeply sympathetic characters struggle for footing in an uncertain world, hounded by forces beyond their control. Their voices are intimate and powerful and they resonate with searing beauty. Antopol is a superb young talent, and The UnAmericans will long be remembered for its wit, humanity, and heart.", "title": "The UnAmericans", "url": "http://www.goodreads.com/book/show/20663759-the-unamericans", "average": 3.97, "cover": "https://images.gr-assets.com/books/1407107716l/20663759.jpg", "reviews": 348, "authors": [{"url": "https://www.goodreads.com/author/show/3448834.Molly_Antopol", "name": "Molly Antopol"}], "type": ["Short Stories", "Fiction", "Historical", "Literary Fiction"], "outlinks": ["http://www.goodreads.com/book/show/20663759-the-unamericans", "http://www.goodreads.com/book/show/17986409-the-unamericans", "http://www.goodreads.com/book/show/24951514-luna-di-miele-con-nostalgia", "http://www.goodreads.com/book/show/7939557-one-story", "http://www.goodreads.com/book/show/22664252-one-story-collected", "http://www.goodreads.com/book/show/31350776-h-ro-smes-mineurs", "http://www.goodreads.com/book/show/39928984-mercy-among-the-children", "http://www.goodreads.com/book/show/20620995-take-me-with-you", "http://www.goodreads.com/book/show/6565401-five-quarters-of-the-orange", "http://www.goodreads.com/book/show/25600623-the-diver-s-clothes-lie-empty", "http://www.goodreads.com/book/show/18867378-the-traveler-s-gift", "http://www.goodreads.com/book/show/40198373-big-stone-gap", "http://www.goodreads.com/book/show/40198387-friendship-bread", "http://www.goodreads.com/book/show/40193401-the-little-giant-of-aberdeen-county", "http://www.goodreads.com/book/show/31160055-the-last-cherry-blossom", "http://www.goodreads.com/book/show/35963775-her-sister-s-shoes", "http://www.goodreads.com/book/show/22617980-the-rock-harbor-collection", "http://www.goodreads.com/book/show/35269080-a-thousand-tomorrows", "http://www.goodreads.com/book/show/40204902-caravans", "http://www.goodreads.com/book/show/31192689-shoeless-joe", "http://www.goodreads.com/book/show/40204877-a-hero-of-france", "http://www.goodreads.com/book/show/6473113-death-in-venice", "http://www.goodreads.com/book/show/40266651-the-tilted-world", "http://www.goodreads.com/book/show/33117501-blonde", "http://www.goodreads.com/book/show/36546758-ever-after", "http://www.goodreads.com/book/show/40193580-rescue", "http://www.goodreads.com/book/show/22032837-the-pearl-that-broke-its-shell", "http://www.goodreads.com/book/show/36589911-the-lords-of-discipline", "http://www.goodreads.com/book/show/11963271-the-sheltering-sky", "http://www.goodreads.com/book/show/25596951-the-dressmaker-s-war", "http://www.goodreads.com/book/show/35120598-gena-finn", "http://www.goodreads.com/book/show/29550710-a-charles-martin-collection", "http://www.goodreads.com/book/show/19977229-remember-tuesday-morning", "http://www.goodreads.com/book/show/8530701-a-town-like-alice", "http://www.goodreads.com/book/show/35414455-the-other-alcott", "http://www.goodreads.com/book/show/18800554-the-scavenger-s-daughters", "http://www.goodreads.com/book/show/26583370-life-and-other-near-death-experiences", "http://www.goodreads.com/book/show/40205036-under-the-udala-trees", "http://www.goodreads.com/book/show/32861105-the-streets-have-no-king", "http://www.goodreads.com/book/show/20552595-how-i-became-a-famous-novelist", "http://www.goodreads.com/book/show/39929534-the-passion", "http://www.goodreads.com/book/show/35654710-this-dark-road-to-mercy", "http://www.goodreads.com/book/show/21942189-the-language-of-hoofbeats", "http://www.goodreads.com/book/show/36004055-not-perfect"]}
