In 1942 the owner had fled Paris fearing Nazi persecution but had continue to make the monthly payments for the apartment. Only after her death in 2010 at the age of 91 her executor sent a team to find out why payments on the apartment had been kept up for 70 years.When the team arrived and unlocked the apartment door, they found a stunningly preserved Parisian apartment filled with many antiques and artwork, all dating back to as far as 1888. What they also found were love letters written by some of the wealthiness and powerful men in history. I am talking Prime Ministers and famous artists! As they dug through the various artworks, clothes, jewels and antiques the team were in complete shock as I am sure I would be too, history from so many years ago was perfectly preserved. But why the owner never returned is a mystery that will never be solved. Except if you are an author with a stunning imagination, brilliant writing skills and a strong believe in happy endings. Then us reading addicts get the chance to step into the abandoned apartment and get taken on a beautiful journey of romance, mystery and history. Author Ella Carey, incorporated this remarkable real life event into a even more remarkable read. We meet Cat, who suddenly finds herself as the new owner of the abandoned apartment. But upon arrival in Paris the original owner's' grandson suddenly makes an appearance and Cat immediately knows he and his mother are the rightful heir's, why they are refusing to claim what clearly belongs to them, is something she intends to rectify, but to do this she needs to solve the mystery and discover why the apartment was left to her in the first place. The read was absolutely stunning from start to finish. From the moment the author took me inside the apartment I was hopelessly trapped ! The author described the detail of the contents with such vivid clarity that I could actually picture it all, without even once having to refer back to the web images, as I often find myself having to do when reading a book based on a real life event. And I was so lost in this stunning world that I could smell the dust and the rot when the doors are opened, I could imagine myself dressing up and sitting down in front of the mirror, dabbing on some perfume and adding some jewels. Yes I realize the author had lots to work with as the images are all over the web, but it takes a very talented author to describe it all to me as reader and not make me want to go look up pictures to form the image in my mind, I am a very visual person and only if you describe something to me in vivid detail will I not go on the hunt. The mystery surrounding Cat and her inheriting something that clearly belongs to someone else was so intriguing that it captured my attention so badly I wished I could climb inside this book and discover for myself what the what, how and who is, lucky for me the author did it for me, she took me on a intense journey as Cat travels through France to discover the truth and along the way I am very pleased to say, she also finds her own little piece of romance. Everything about this book was simply magical, the vividly described backdrops, the remarkable characters, the mysteries being unraveled, the romance, everything blended to pure perfection by the author. I highly recommend this read for anyone and everyone that loves reading. It was a history lesson mixed with a large dose of mystery and a dash of romance, what more could a reader ask for! Thank you Ella Carey for letting me experience a touch of magic and wonder, and letting my mind drift into the world of the possibilities of just why someone would never return to some of the world's most amazing treasures. 5/5 star review \" The mystery starts with a key, a portrait and some old love letters\" **** The story is the author's own and no possible reason for the owner never returning has ever been found."}, {"userName": "Tiffany", "userReviewDate": "Sep 23, 2014", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/2628118-tiffany", "userReview": "Oh, this was terribly written. There was so much potential in this story. An apartment in Paris that was left abandoned for years that was finally opened and the mystery begins. Apparently this is based on a true story, although the true owner was never actually found. The dialogue in this book is just painful to read. It doesn't even make sense at times. I'm very surprised that it ever made publication. Why did I read the whole thing? I thought the author did a great job describing the apartment and the Parisian countryside and at times it was really quite nice. But overall- painful to read. Cannot recommend."}, {"userName": "Amanda - Mrs B's Book Reviews", "userReviewDate": "Feb 08, 2017", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/16323644-amanda---mrs-b-s-book-reviews", "userReview": "*4.5 stars https://mrsbbookreviews.wordpress.comI cannot seem to quench my thirst for any book that features the beautiful city of Paris. When I scored myself a copy of Australian author Ella\u2019s Carey\u2019s novel Paris Time Capsule, I was over the moon. With an exquisite cover and a personally signed message from the author, I felt very spoilt to read this book before I started the opening chapter!Paris Time Capsule begins with the disturbance of a mysterious apartment in Paris, which has remained untouched since World War II. In the present day, we meet Cat Jordan, a free spirited young lady who lives in New York, making a living from her photography. Cat receives a call out of the blue to advise that she is the sole benefactor of an apartment in central Paris, through a friend of her Grandmother. Unable to deal with the inheritance from New York, Cat must travel to Paris to claim her apartment. When she arrives in Paris, Cat receives the keys to the apartment and on opening it, she receives the shock of her life. The apartment is a testament to history, as it is exactly the same as it was when it was left during the war. Unsure of her connection to the woman who gifted her apartment and why it was left in such a way naturally intrigues Cat. As a result, she sets off on a journey of discovery that takes her away from Paris and into the south of France. The more Cat digs into the life of Isabelle de Florian, the essential link to the apartment, the more she drifts away from her life in New York. A connection with Isabelle\u2019s grandson Loic complicates matters further for Cat. Matters of the heart and ensuring that the secrets held by this miraculous apartment are put to rest, is the central story of Paris Time Capsule.The main concept that Paris Time Capsule is based on \u2013 a mysterious apartment the heart of in Paris that has been locked away for years, easily gained my full attention. I had high hopes of enjoying this book immensely due to the principal subject matter and location. Thankfully, Paris Time Capsule easily met my expectations. There is much to love about this book. The romantic main setting of the book is based in Paris (and a little in New York) and was described by the author in a way that made me feel like I was back in the city I love. Paris in the past, during the sequences involving Isabelle de florian\u2019s story was described in beautiful period detail. I felt completely transported to the second world war in France, all thanks to the handiwork of author Ella Carey.The characters featured in Paris Time Capsule were a delight. Carey makes it easy for us to enjoy the characters both in the past and present. In the present, I felt that Cat was a fitting main character to lead this book. Although we see her flaws, she transfers to the page as a kind and loyal person, determined to do right by those who come into her path. Cat is matched with a very appealing leading man, Loic and I had high hopes for Cat and Loic as a couple. Carey provides us with a heart rendering romance in the present day storyline that was completely satisfying. In the past narrative, the characters are just as appealing. I became swept up in the exciting life of Isabelle during the war, she was a full bodied character with a whole host of secrets. These secrets were an essential part of the character and the book itself, which worked to draw me further into this mesmerising tale.Paris Time Capsule is a highly romantic and intriguing piece of fiction. This novel perfectly blends history together with an inspiring true to life tale of a lost apartment in Paris. It is a book that I feel privileged to have crossed my hands and I endorse it to all lovers of France, historical fiction and romance.*With thanks to the author Ella Carey for a copy of this book which I won via a giveaway."}, {"userName": "Tricia Rogers", "userReviewDate": "Sep 11, 2014", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/2819259-tricia-rogers", "userReview": "I had such high hopes for this story! Based on the true story of the abandoned Paris apartment found after 70 years of being closed up, it sounded interesting. Instead it was a poorly written attempt at interesting fiction. As an editor, I cringed at the errors in typing, grammar and overuse of the main character's name instead of inserting a few pronouns from time to time. I wanted to know the \"big secret\" so I kept reading only to be disappointed and totally aggravated with such unimaginative fluff."}, {"userName": "Georgina Penney", "userReviewDate": "Apr 11, 2014", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/21376418-georgina-penney", "userReview": "4.5 out of five. Wow. Just wow. This was an absolutely gorgeous read and from a debut author no less.I saw a profile of Ella Carey on Nas Dean's blog, Romance Book Paradise,a couple of weeks ago and after reading the premise for The Paris Time Capsule and loving the cover I decided to give it a go. I remembered reading a newspaper article about the apartment a couple of months back and loved that someone had taken it and used it for inspiration. Ms. Carey has certainly done the story justice. I won't go into plot because any other review here on Goodreads will take you through that but what I will tell you is that Ella Carey made me feel like I was standing in Paris, in that apartment. She's got a talent for interweaving setting and characterization that is simply captivating. I was hooked. It's rare I find a book that I don't want to finish because I was enjoying it so much but this is one of them. If this was her debut, I can't wait to read the next one."}, {"userName": "Dale Harcombe", "userReviewDate": "Dec 03, 2016", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/4800708-dale-harcombe", "userReview": "Cat Jordan receives a package that sends her life into a whirl. She has inherited an estate from a complete stranger. Anxious to sort the matter out, she leaves Christian, her lover and flies immediately to Paris. What she finds is an apartment that has been left intact with furniture and furnishings but vacant since 1940. Sounds like an interesting premise for a story, doesn\u2019t it? Even more interesting when the reader learns this is based on a real event and a real abandoned apartment. As a result I was so interested to read this novel. While the premise and the plot was good I struggled with the writing style. To me it felt clunky with sentences and paragraphs that didn\u2019t flow well and some of the dialogue was awkward. I also struggled with the characters and felt they lacked depth. I found it hard to relate to Cat who allows people, her lover and his friends in particular, to ride roughshod over her opinions and desires. Christian is one of the privileged rich and I had trouble seeing what she ever saw in him. Cat discovers someone else who could have been left the inheritance that came to her and she seeks to understand why it had not been left to Isabelle\u2019s de Florian\u2019s relatives. I was intrigued enough to want to know who Isabelle de Florian was and why she has neglected her own family. That was the motivation to keep reading. In the end though, I found the story and the characters implausible and the writing style jarring. The descriptions of French Countryside and the elegant apartment were well conveyed but overall I was left disappointed in this book. Others may like it better than I did, but I just felt it could have been so much richer and more engrossing."}, {"userName": "Andrea", "userReviewDate": "Oct 14, 2014", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/10223401-andrea", "userReview": "I wanted so much to like this book. The premise, an abandoned apartment in Paris filled with treasures, sounds delightful. And it's based on a true story! Unfortunately, this book did not deliver. It seriously needed an editor to ask if certain things were really necessary and to point out inconsistencies. Just one example, in the beginning, the main character receives a mysterious package from Paris. She can't wait to open it but before she can, she has to do several other things. All throughout the evening, she can't stop thinking about the box, to the point where she gets out of bed in the middle of the night to open it and satisfy her curiosity. But first, she's going to make a cup of hot chocolate from scratch and then wash the dishes before she finally opens it. When she gets to Paris, there's a rival for the apartment...except he doesn't want the apartment either and far too many pages are spent with the two characters insisting the apartment belongs to the other. It felt like the author was in school, trying to meet a certain number of page requirements. I don't usually give negative reviews because I'm sure the author worked hard on their story (it feels like criticizing someone's child) but I wish I had seen a review like this before I spent money on this book."}, {"userName": "Maria", "userReviewDate": "Apr 07, 2014", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/3170050-maria", "userReview": "This is the debut novel from the Francophile Ella Carey. And what an experience reading this has been. Beautifully crafted, it\u2019s as tempting as a profiterole, as delicious as a freshly baked croissant, as satisfying as a cup of French \u2018caf\u00e9\u2019 and as heady as a glass of French red wine. Am I a Francophile? The answer is yes. My French is a bit rusty I know, but I adore the whole French experience and love to visit \u2018la belle France\u2019 when the opportunity arises, even if it\u2019s only through the pages of a book\u2026\u2026When the lovably boho photographer Cat Jordan, who is in a serious relationship with a Wall Street financier, receives the key to a French apartment in the post and realizes that a certain Isabelle de Florian has bequeathed her an apartment, totally ignoring her own heirs, Cat is drawn into a web of intrigue which will send her on a journey from Paris to Provence, turning back the pages of history. The journey takes her to wartime France and even further, back to those legendary Parisian days when the ladies of the \u2018demi monde\u2019 ruled Paris. The beautiful courtesan, Marthe de Florian, looms large in the story, even if she\u2019s only a shadow from the past. The film \u2018Camille\u2019 starring Greta Garbo, springs to mind, along with the glamour of another age. As Cat unravels the mysteries of Marthe\u2019s Paris apartment, her own world (not to mention her Wall Street financier) is calling her back. But does she really want to return? Cat will not only discover the truth about her grandmother, but she will also discover the truth about herself.For readers of romance and mystery, THE PARIS TIME CAPSULE is highly recommended. Considering that it practically brings you on a trip to France and back, it\u2019s worth every cent you\u2019ll spend on its purchase. I count myself very lucky to have received my copy in exchange for this review."}, {"userName": "The Lit Bitch", "userReviewDate": "Sep 08, 2015", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/4537892-the-lit-bitch", "userReview": "This story was whimsical and fun. I loved the idea of a mysterious apartment in romantic Paris full of treasures and history. I absolutely loved the premise of this story! But the storu itself was a little rough and cliche in places. For instance, the bohemian girl and traditional rich guy romance was so cliche\u2026.they clearly did not belong together and I flat out couldn\u2019t stand Christian from the start. They were clearly so wrong for each other. Loic on the other hand was dashing and mysterious which I liked\u2026..and their romance was much also cliche but yet fit better. The only thing that bothered me was Loic\u2019s propensity for using Cat\u2019s name excessively in the dialogue.That for me was the biggest issue of the novel\u2026.some of the dialogue was a little rough and needed some polishing. I found some of the dialogue tedious and basically just thick with unnecessary things like the over use of Cat\u2019s name by Loic as an example. It just didn\u2019t flow well for me.I also struggled with Cat\u2019s sense of denial about her relationship with Christian. Over all it was evident that she was fighting a losing battle and allowing him to just take over her life\u2026..she was so passive about it all that I just found her self talk and rational frustrating.There were aspects of this novel that I really liked such as the premise, but the dialogue needed some polishing, and I think that Cat could have been stronger and grown more substantially throughout the story. Overall there were fun things about this book that I really really liked and with some editing and refining it would be such a good story. For some reason I just got hung up on the dialogue which made me sad because I think the story would have flowed better with better dialogue.See my full review here"}, {"userName": "Siv30",

world upside down and inside out? It wasn't just a simply wrapped present from someone in that city, but an immersion into a mysterious world of suspense, intrigue and complications that now filled her former calm and stable life. Plodding along in her calm and serene life, Catherine \u201cCat\u201d Jordan is content as a photographer for a studio and pleased in her stable relationship with her boyfriend,Christian Carter. When the package arrives and she needs to go to Paris to straighten it out, she never realizes all the changes that would take place. The key she received in the package belongs to an apartment caught in a time warp, filled with priceless possessions, and a decades old mystery. With the arrival of Loic Archer, the grandson of the previous owner, on the scene, the mystery deepens. She wants to do the right thing and give it to him and his family, but they refuse without knowing why Isabelle de Florian, their grandmother, wanted it this way. So a deal is struck between them. She will investigate the mystery and if she can prove it is theirs, they will take it. But she can't forget Christian, who wants to hurry their engagement along swiftly. No one seems to care what she wants. Only she has the same question, what does she want? With every answer came another question. Why did Isabelle leave a Parisian apartment filled with antiques, love letters and an original Boldini painting to her? Why was everything not left to her own family instead? Was she so accommodating now with Christian that she would allow others to plan her engagement party and wedding regardless of her desires? How could she continue to ignore the feelings that she felt for Loic? And what about the questions she asked herself? Was she trying to mold herself into Christian's world? Had she forgotten her dream of owning a photography studio? All valid questions that needed answers that only she could find. Maybe with the answers she could satisfy herself, Christian, Loic and Slyvie, Isabelle's daughter.A fabulous book. The intricate weaving of a superbly written plot with well developed characters around a true historical event. With the descriptions of scenery, residencies, and other intimate details, such as, the dust storm upon first opening the apartment after so many years, the rows of grape vines trailing across the hillside and perusing old texts in an ancient nunnery, I felt as if I was there trying to help solve the mystery. The intertwining of several stories about love, life and the pursuit of happiness provided an excellent backdrop to the main plot. Ella Carey weaved an incredible, marvelous story. This was the first book I have read of hers, but it will not be the last.Highly recommend to all romance readers who enjoy a story filled with history, mystery, love and romance.I was given a copy by the author for an honest review. 5/5 stars A package, a key and a mystery could change your entire life."}, {"userName": "Helen", "userReviewDate": "Apr 13, 2014", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/2120137-helen", "userReview": "This is a book that you should not miss reading based on a true story about an apartment left untouched for over 70 years since the German invasion of Paris during the 2nd world war. MS Carey has written a magical story about what happens when American Catherine Jordan is left this apartment in the owners will, Cat is in a releationship with an upper class Guy Christian but when Cat goes to Paris to sort this all out and the grandson of the owner Isabelle de Florian Loic Archer arrives on the scene and together they open the door of the apartment to discover riches that have been left untouched and a very moving journey begins. This is such a great story as Cat tries to unravel the mystery of why the apartment was left to her and not Isabelle's family with the help of Loic although they know that Cat's grandmother was Isabelle's best friend there is still a lot to unravel.This is so well written I read it in one sitting and just couldn't put it down I loved the adventure and the journey to finding out why and how this all came about and getting to know Cat and Loic so well the scenery of France is just so good and the characters are rich and full don't miss this one."}, {"userName": "KatLynne", "userReviewDate": "Aug 15, 2017", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/2435483-katlynne", "userReview": "3.5 StarsOf the three books in this series, I was surprised to find this second installment not very well written.

Such an awesome premise! Add in the fact that it is loosely based on a real Parisian apartment that was finally opened in 2010 after 70 years and you've just upped the 'I gotta read this' factor substantially.I'd call this book a romance with a light historical fiction back drop and a mystery. There's a lot going on in this wee book. Romance is typically not my favourite genre but the historical fiction aspect piqued my interest. So it won't come as a big surprise that my favourite part of the book were the descriptions of Paris, the apartment and its contents. I could have spent a lot more time reading about the vivid descriptions of Paris and the items in the apartment. Unfortunately one cannot live on descriptions of jambon baguettes and 1940's dresses alone (at least I don't think so). Early on in the book it became apparent that there was less historical fiction/mystery and a lot more time focusing on the romantic aspect. The romance was cute if predictable which many readers may enjoy. Cat, for the most part, is a good main character - flaws and all. She had two different personalities - strong woman in France with Loic and the weak, unopinionated girlfriend to a cliched New York City socialite who patronized her constantly. The weaker Cat was hard for me to read and for a smart woman she came off fairly obtuse about her love life. But I enjoyed seeing her go through some self-development towards the end of the book. I was pleased to see the mystery become the focus of the book towards the end when the mystery twist was divulged. The fact that I didn't guess the big reveal was great! I also enjoyed how Carey took a small tidbit of history that many readers may not know about and brings it to the forefront and wraps her story around it.If I had to give a couple of negatives about Paris Time Capsule it would be that at times the dialogue was weak and there was too much time spent on situations which were, in my opinion, unimportant to the overall plot. For example, a lot of time was spent with the back and forth dialogue between Cat and Sylive of 'but you MUST take the inheritance' followed by 'no, YOU must have it, I insist'. Even with the reasons given it was still hard to understand why both sides were so adamant not to have the inheritance. I'm sure a simpler way (perhaps getting Sylvie to claim it to reduce the high tax and then splitting it afterwards) would have been a much easier way to deal with the issue. I would have preferred for more time to be spent on engaging the reader in the historical mystery aspect which is why I picked up the book in the first place. Overall I found Paris Time Capsule to be a quick, entertaining, light read. People who enjoy a quick read with a light historical fiction mystery and a strong romantic focus should enjoy this book.My Rating: 3.5/5 starsDisclaimer: My sincere thanks to TLC Book Tours and Ella Carey for providing me with a complimentary paperback copy of this book in exchange for my honest review."}, {"userName": "Andrea", "userReviewDate": "Apr 29, 2014", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/11704733-andrea", "userReview": "After finishing this book a few days ago I still find myself somewhat disappointed by it. I studied French in high school and have even visited Paris once. I was super excited when I heard about this book. I was hoping to be able to experience the magic of the city again. That was not really the case. I guess I was looking for more on the mystery of the apartment than on the main character herself. Maybe I'm just too picky.A few things I didn't like:This novel felt more like a romcom to me. You know the one where the two main characters fall in love only to be driven apart and then brought back together again. It's been done tooooo many times. Cat just drops everything in her life to go to a foreign city where she meets this handsome stranger and after knowing him for 3 days takes off to travel the country with him. The whole situation felt a bit forced to me. I think this is partly due to the fact that we know nothing about Loic until after Cat leaves Paris with him on a whim.Cat always talks about her parents marriage. Yet I felt as though I knew very little about her family and how they shaped the person that she became. A few more details here would have helped.Cat's overbearing and somewhat controlling fianc\u00e9. I get that his character had to be this way to play up the part of the other male lead. But, he could have been toned down a bit.Overall, I like the subject of the novel- it definitely left me wanting to know more about the actual apartment that was abandoned for 70+ years in Paris. As for this rendition of the story...I guess I wanted more details in places and a few less in others. It just didn't seem to balance out for me."}, {"userName": "Carolyn", "userReviewDate": "Mar 04, 2017", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/13546898-carolyn", "userReview": "I really enjoyed reading Paris Time Capsule by Ella Carey.A stunning novel about a long-forgotten apartment in Paris ~ based on a true story.The main character, Cat is a photographer and she is about to begin a new life with her boyfriend at home in New York when her whole life is turned upside down on the discovery that she suddenly has inherited a Belle Epoque apartment in Paris.This leads Cat on a tour of advanced research in France as to why and how she's been left this long forgotten Paris apartment filled with dust of times and days gone by, antiques, mirrors and paintings framed in gold.Cat enjoys her journey finding out about the heirlooms in the apartment and who they actually belong to and the secrets hiding behind each piece of exquisite artwork and their value but most of all it's the finding out of the family secrets it all belongs to which will intrigue you the most.This is a great story.

Packed with loads of information I do recommend you find a quiet corner to fully appreciate the story. It's certainly not a book that you can read with the TV on in the background.Inspired by recent events and a true story Ella Carey has written a wonderful tale about Cat Jordan who inherits an apartment in Paris. It doesnt belong to her or her family so she's quite sure it isnt rightfully hers to inherit. Along the way we meet many interesting characters, Loic Archer, grandson of the owner, her boyfriend Christian, the art investigators and characters Cat uses to delve into the mystery of the apartment. The apartment is filled with antique parisian furniture and art which is worth a fortune. What's priceless tho is the historical letters that are discovered.It's hard to discuss the plot without spoiling the story so I would like to draw attention to the lovely way the story is written, it flows well and slowly drew me in as the mystery surrounding the apartment and the past owner is gradually discovered thru the letters and the furniture and art which also tells its own story while in the meantime we have Cat and her fiancee and his family in the background then mixed with that is Loic, Cat's partner in crime if you will, who is there with his realistic outlook on life and I can tell you it wasn't very far into the story that I wished and hoped Cat would look his way and throw stuck up Christian to the curb.I was very lucky to receive an ARC from the Author for my honest opinion which summed up is: The Paris Time Capsule by Ella Carey is a magical story, it swept me back to a past era, a time long gone by, with characters that were endearing and charming, it took me on a great ride that my imagination had a ball of a time with and which I felt was quite lovely when I finished.I must also mention the lovely cover, it begs to be read.Find yourself a secluded corner and let The Paris Time Capsule sweep you away to another time and place, you are only limited by your imagination and Ella Carey's story certainly lets you use tons of it."}, {"userName": "Mrsbooks", "userReviewDate": "May 22, 2014", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/9400098-mrsbooks", "userReview": "No! This was not a good book but I had to finish it because I had to know the answer!Now I know and I don't think it was worth it. I should have just looked it up. The idea behind this book is great. There really is an apartment out there and it was interesting how this author was going to take that story and make fictional sense out of it. When I read a book I usually find there is too much detail and I get bored. Well, I think I might stop complaining about that after reading this book. Things happenend like... Girl walks up to bar, orders glass of wine, says something to the man next to her, he responds, and now she's tipsy from too much wine?!? I didn't even know her wine arrived in that short time frame and boy, she must have guzzled down that thing!! That's what I mean by lack of details. Other instances are equally annoying. Someone will say something and another character will be offended. I'm like, whoa where did that come from? So then I go back and re read that part and yes, I guess if you KNEW it was said in an offending way it makes sense but you weren't told that. Other times people say rude things (or what I assume are rude) and the main character doesn't seem bothered. The main character also continuously let's everyone push her around. Annoying! Especially when she's finally got the information she's looking for (or she at least thinks she does) she doesn't even take the time to read it? Sure she tries, she makes excuses to go to the bathroom....seriously??? Are you that much of an wimp that you can't tell whoever you're with to shut the hell up and let you read something important??? (Said in the nicest way possible of course lol)So no, this was not a good book. A good story with lots of potential and a neat mystery but too annoying to be worth it."}, {"userName": "Andrea Guy", "userReviewDate": "Sep 02, 2015", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/1887553-andrea-guy", "userReview": "OMG! This book is so wonderful! I would absolutely love to get a letter saying there was an apartment in Paris with my name on it, an apartment that had been left locked up for years no less.AHH!I liked Cat and was frustrated with her at the same time. I loved how quirky she was, but I couldn't understand how someone that was really such an artsy person would want to be with such a controlling man as Christian. The further I got into the book the more I wanted to shake her and tell her that she had to get out of that relationship.That's why I loved Loic and his family ties in with the apartment and because of this Cat gets to learn more about the owner of the apartment. As soon as you meet him, you know that there's going to be a triangle of sorts between the two men, and Loic is the exact opposite of Christian. I really wish there were more of a romance between them, but oddly Ella didn't really go for the love triangle angle with this story, and in some ways I really liked that. I'm not a fan of cheaters. I was also glad that she did show some backbone.I absolutely loved how she finally found out the connection between her grandmother and Loic's family. That part of the novel is bittersweet and may bring a tear to your eyes. It did mine.This is one of those novels that bring the past and present together and it really is worth reading, especially if you need some light reading to end the summer or just to help pass a nice afternoon.This book is the first in a series, and I can't wait to see what the next book brings."}, {"userName": "Ne", "userReviewDate": "Apr 30, 2018", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/5407834-ne", "userReview": "https://algodaodoceparaocerebro.blogs...Uma C\u00e1psula do Tempo em Paris chegou c\u00e1 em in\u00edcios de Mar\u00e7o com \u00f3ptimas recomenda\u00e7\u00f5es de quem j\u00e1 o tinha lido. Com isto, gerou-se toda uma expectativa positiva e por isso quando o comecei a ler e me deparei com uma escrita algo \"verde\" (isto \u00e9, pouco madura, sem grande fluidez ou naturalidade) fiquei bastante desiludida. Eu n\u00e3o sou escritora, mas sou leitora de livros suficientes para comparar escritas diferentes, formas de conduzir ac\u00e7\u00f5es ou di\u00e1logos diferentes, e a maneira de Elle Carey (ou de quem traduziu) n\u00e3o foi compat\u00edvel com os meus gostos infelizmente.Achei tudo demasiado for\u00e7ado, a rela\u00e7\u00e3o de Cat com Loic, al\u00e9m de ser \u00f3bvia n\u00e3o teve qualquer fa\u00edsca ou empatia, j\u00e1 para n\u00e3o falar da rela\u00e7\u00e3o de Cat com o seu namorado Christian e restante fam\u00edlia e amigos! Esta \u00faltima rela\u00e7\u00e3o s\u00f3 mostrou o quando a personagem tem uma personalidade fraca e fr\u00e1gil, demasiado boazinha at\u00e9 para dizer n\u00e3o ao namorado. Para al\u00e9m de Cat dizer que sente saudades, as ac\u00e7\u00f5es provam outra coisa. Al\u00e9m disso, a autora tem a mania de colocar os telefonemas entre eles ao mesmo tempo que alguma coisa importante acontecia, o que me irritou solenemente.Este romance \u00e9 para algu\u00e9m que goste de vintage, moda e decora\u00e7\u00e3o, visto que est\u00e1 cheio de descri\u00e7\u00f5es do g\u00e9nero e a pr\u00f3pria personagem principal \u00e9 fortemente adepta. Logo a\u00ed, as descri\u00e7\u00f5es da sua roupa e depois do apartamento em Paris acabaram por ser enfadonhas, n\u00e3o s\u00f3 pela tem\u00e1tica como pela exaust\u00e3o de todos os pormenores.Cat mant\u00e9m-se sempre presa a Paris, o que para mim foi um ponto positivo j\u00e1 que visitei a cidade h\u00e1 pouco tempo e adorei, por isso qualquer pormenor referente \u00e0 cidade para mim foi um ponto bastante animado no meio de tudo o resto.A fam\u00edlia de Loic, principalmente Sylvie, pareceu-me tamb\u00e9m algo exagerada. Penso que de quem eu gostei mesmo, para al\u00e9m de Loic, foi de Isabelle, que apesar de falecida est\u00e1 bastante presente, tanto em mem\u00f3rias como em poucas cartas.Gostei da ideia do apartamento intocado durante tantos anos e do valor do quadro e da sua descoberta. Gostei da tem\u00e1tica das vinhas. Mas n\u00e3o gostei da mistura de l\u00ednguas no livro, com tradu\u00e7\u00e3o logo a seguir. J\u00e1 sabemos que isto \u00e9 um livro traduzido, por isso apesar de perceber a ideia, o facto de usar franc\u00eas pelo meio e depois a tradu\u00e7\u00e3o faz com que torne os di\u00e1logos repetitivos, at\u00e9 porque usam muitas palavras monossil\u00e1bicas que nos faz querer dizer \"anda l\u00e1 com isso, j\u00e1 percebemos!\". Repetitivos tamb\u00e9m s\u00e3o os momentos de \"para quem fica o apartamento\", n\u00e3o havendo evolu\u00e7\u00e3o de nenhuma das partes.Vi agora que este \u00e9 o primeiro livro de uma saga de tr\u00eas, mas apenas este \u00e9 baseado em factos ver\u00eddicos. Hum, n\u00e3o seria melhor publicar apenas este? E os restantes \u00e0 parte?Li at\u00e9 ao final, porque me comprometi com a editora, mas a minha opini\u00e3o mant\u00e9m-se: a autora precisa de mais experi\u00eancia no que toca a colocar no papel as suas ideias e a sua hist\u00f3ria."}, {"userName": "Kathleen", "userReviewDate": "May 11, 2014", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/4896869-kathleen", "userReview": "I feel really torn about this book. It feels like it was a really, really great idea for a plot that maybe wasn't executed as well as it could have been. The story - WOW - it was unbelievably great! But it didn't even start unfurling until more than 3/4 of the way through the book and then it was done through the reading of a letter. It was a let down to just \"read\" the whole story. It would have been so much better to have had small bits and pieces throughout the story, to be able to turn those thoughts around and do a bit of wondering yourself instead of it all being regurgitated to you in a letter.The writing felt a bit off to me. The descriptive bits were done beautifully but the dialogue was stilted and strange. The characters seemed to speak in stunted sentences that I sometimes had to re-read to fully understand. Sometimes I wondered if the book had been translated or the author spoke English as a second language?And the characters - they were all really interesting but they felt a little flat. Did we really know what made them tick? Did Cat really leave her fiance because of a business deal??? Or did she leave him because he called her \"HONEY\" in, almost literally, every single line of dialogue??? And Loic, other than Cat thought he was attractive, was there any kind of attraction between the two of them? On the other hand, I felt like the characters from the past were really well done. I understood their backgrounds and what motivated them.The apartment. Shouldn't that have actually been a character in the book? Shouldn't we have known more about what was in there? Not from a museum curator's interest, but from Cat and Loic. Shouldn't they have spent more time looking through belongings? Isn't this where we would have found out many of those bits and pieces of clues that I feel were so lacking in the first 200 pages? And the clothes - wouldn't Cat have been pawing all over them? Shouldn't we have had some descriptions? Isn't this where Cat and Loic would have begun to connect?And on to my last gripe. The apartment and it's tie to the past were in the Belle Epoque period of France's history. I've never heard of it. Sounds interesting doesn't it? I know very little about history and like to read stories that teach me. Unfortunately I had to look this period up on the internet. The book gave me nothing! So, after all this - please pick the book up.

It states that she had inherited something and enclosed she finds a key. She is intrigued by the idea of an inheritance but knows it could be something really small. She knows that her grand-mother used to live in Paris in her wild youth. So she has to go to Paris to find out the truth as the lawyer refused to divulge the truth of her inheritance to her over the phone. What she finds in Paris astounds her because she has inherited the beautiful and mysterious Isabelle de Florian\u2019s legacy, her apartment full of old, unique and antique treasures. Among them a very valuable painting of Isabelle\u2019s grandmother Marthe de Florian, a courtesan of the high class. And the apartment is full of love letters from the very powerful and wealthy men. She is not sure that she is the rightful heir when another heir turns up. She is all for giving it all up to Loic Archer and his mother, the true heirs. But they refuse to take her inheritance. They just wanted to find out why Isabelle kept this a secret. She had so much wealth yet she lived a very poor life. Loic\u2019s mother cannot reconcile to the fact that she was brought up in poverty while her mother had all this wealth stashed away. And the main reason\u2026why Cat Jordan as the heir? So Cat has to find out the truth for them as well as for herself. Then she embarks on a fascinating journey of discovery. Unearthing the truth also brings her self-discovery and what she wants in her life. THE PARIS TIME CAPSULE is an intriguing story. A reader would get hooked from the first page and would keep turning the pages till late at night, trying to unravel the mystery this story is. It is a mysterious, thrilling and suspenseful story. Yet the author Ella Carey also did justice to the romance thread running throughout the story. The interaction between Cat, Loic and his mother is warm and tender.

So I was pretty excited to read the book.Having read it, I am a little disappointed. I think if the author had taken more time to create the characters more in depth and not jumping from situation to situation which didn't always read fluently, it would have been a great story.My annoyances are, for instance, her having a boyfriend, Christian, who is rich and can't seem but to keep calling her 'honey' every sentence he utters which started to really get on my nerves. The woman has a name for crying out loud and if you do insist on calling someone honey, don't do it in every sentence. It's overkill.Also especially in the beginning of the book, the main character Catherine/Cat comes across as a push over and a flake: she lets everyone run her life for her.As the story develops it actually turns into what could be a great story if situations wouldn't have been, in my eyes, cut short or the developing relationship between Cat and Loic had been described better. To me it seemed they were working together, travelling together and all of the sudden poof he is in love with her; there was no logical flow in the story to really believe it.So overall not a bad read at all, nice story but could have been better if the characters and story line had more depth to them."}, {"userName": "Mia", "userReviewDate": "Sep 30, 2014", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/8534103-mia", "userReview": "The leading lady was the narrator...but I will damned if I remember much about her beyond how unselfish she seemed.

It was quite perfect actually!I adored the premise of this novel: a decadent Paris apartment abandoned and untouched for 70 years. And while this story is fiction, the apartment is not. I was only a few chapters into the novel when I couldn\u2019t resist any longer; I had to Google this mystery apartment and get a look at it for myself. There are many images of Marthe de Florian\u2019s apartment online and viewing them was like eye candy for a history buff. Absolutely extraordinary and a fascinating basis for a novel.What started out as intriguing for me, continued on at a good pace with an engaging story right the way through. While I couldn\u2019t wait to have the mystery solved \u2013 why the apartment had been left untouched and then willed to a stranger while family still lived \u2013 I was absorbed enough in the daily minature of the characters to not want the ending rushed. The dynamic between Cat and Loic was quite special, right from the outset. Cat\u2019s fiance, Christian, and his persistent American crew, added plenty of humorous moments, although there was a point at which I was willing Cat to just turn off her mobile phone in place of answering every intrusive call. But she got there in the end, and in discovering the mystery surrounding the apartment, she was able to discover a fair bit about herself along the way.The most special part of this novel for me was the uncovering of the big mystery. I rarely hear or read of a story from WWII that doesn\u2019t touch me \u2013 I have personal family connections that always weigh in \u2013 but this one in particular left me reeling and wishing that Ella Carey had gone with a dual time frame narrative instead. I would have appreciated more of the WWII story in hindsight. I love this quote towards the end of the novel. Not only does it sum up the reasons behind the apartment being abandoned, but it sums up what every single person who lived through WWII in Europe must have felt like throughout their lives after. I have removed the character\u2019s name and inserted \u2018she\u2019 to avoid spoilers.\u201cShe never trusted the world in which she lived after that war. Like so many others, she did not trust that she could share what had happened with those she loved \u2013 she didn\u2019t believe they could understand the decisions that had to be made at that time unless they had lived through the terrible period themselves.\u201dMy grandfather had felt the same way. I was fortunate enough to have had him confide in me about some of his WWII experiences before he passed away, but I know he held a lot of it back. Extraordinary lives and extraordinary people.Paris Time Capsule was my first Ella Carey novel, but it definitely will not be my last.
