This is my first encounter with Linda Lael Miller's writing, and frankly, I have no clue why she gets such high marks. Maybe it's just me. Maybe it's this particular book. The plot is full of gaps and inconsistencies, the relationship developed overnight, and the heroine is unlikeable for the first several chapters.Jack Garrett's audio narration is worth five fabulous stars, though. This heroine. Grrrr! A schoolmarm in small town Texas, 1915, Piper steps outside during a December blizzard, at night. She capably drags Sawyer McKettrick into her schoolhouse when she finds him \"half-covered in snow\" and unconscious from blood loss - bullet wound. Does she bother to take off his wet clothing? Nope. She leaves them on all night, but just tosses a blanket over him. No hot water bottle for him. No hot bricks or warming pan (she lives in the schoolhouse). Not even a pillow for his head! And she is just too plum tuckered out to drag him across the room to the fireplace, so he must stay there, lying by the door. Hey, at least she got him inside, right? She cleans and bandages his bullet wound, and determines that it definitely needs stitches, but decides there is no way she could ever push a needle through his skin. What an idiot! The next day, she reluctantly gets some quilts from her hope chest, because --- why, he's cold! But he might get blood on her wedding quilts. After all, she got his blood on her gray mittens so she had no choice but to burn them. Yup. Her only pair, in December, during a blizzard. I guess she's never heard of cold water and soap. Did the same thing to her ONLY cloak -- and it's gray, too. Now this poor impoverished idiotic feeb of a school teacher has no cloak and no mittens. Lord spare me! And all her fretting about whether he is an outlaw, when Clay clearly trusts him, his cousin.Gradually I warmed up to Piper, but just enough to keep listening to the wonderful voice of Jack Garrett. She goes through a character shift midway through the book and becomes \"fiesty\" enough to stand up for a suffering student. Then I have to deal with the stupidity of Clay and his wife, Dara. Ok. So, Dara gives birth to a baby, far from town on their ranch. During the week the baby is born there was a diphtheria scare in town. And another attempted murder. So, what do the proud new parents do? They bring the newborn infant -- barely a week old -- to town for the Christmas pageant!! This is 1915, folks! Cold building, with one potbelly stove. Horses, not heated cars. No doctor in the town, only a dentist. No hospital. Sure, bring the newborn! NO BRAINS!!And Sawyer didn't go after his killer? We'll just let that plot thread disappear. Why not?And Bess (the brothel owner) butted in where she had no business, taking huge risks when she is the only thing standing between destitution and her young daughter. But that's okay, cuz Piper sees in Bess's love for Jenny Sue the real spirit of Christmas. Love. A mother's love that will sacrifice everything. Except...oh yeah...she's bringing her daughter up inside a brothel. The same brothel that the author described as degraded. If Bess has enough money to own a brothel -- one of the few places in town with indoor plumbing -- she has enough money to leave town and give her daughter a fresh start elsewhere.Oh vey.But the smexy scenes were certainly explicit. And there are some heartwarming scenes with the school children, and with Clay and Dara's girls."}, {"userName": "Susan", "userReviewDate": "Oct 04, 2012", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/1127488-susan", "userReview": "Very good book - of course, it's a McKettrick story. Sawyer has come to Blue River to take over as marshal from his cousin Clay. Before he can do that he's shot and left for dead. Piper finds him and takes him to her room at the schoolhouse. He's hurt too badly to be moved and must recover there. This does Piper's reputation no good, so they marry to make it all respectable. I really liked both Piper and Sawyer. Piper is from the East, and a bit nervous about being in the \"wild west\". She comes off as rather timid at first, worried about Sawyer being an outlaw, even though he says he's a McKettrick and Clay's cousin. Once she accepts the fact that he's there to stay, her natural practicality and sass comes out. I like the way she stands up to him when she needs to, but also takes care of him. She is surprised by his offer of marriage, but realizes that she wants to marry him. I love her natural kindness to one of the little girls at her school and the girl's mother, the local madam. I thought the part where she went to the brothel when the girl was sick was terrific and loved the way she stood up to everyone. She fell for Sawyer pretty quickly, but they seemed to complement each other very well. Sawyer seemed pretty laid back for a McKettrick. In spite of his injury he was very courteous to Piper, not at all arrogant. He found her worry about him being an outlaw amusing, and enjoyed her spunkiness when it came out. His decision to marry her to save her reputation surprisingly didn't scare him. In fact, he found the idea appealing. He also gave her fair warning that he intended to seduce her. I really enjoyed the way he backed her up over the little girl's care. The ending at the ranch in Arizona, with all the family there, was very good."}, {"userName": "Emily", "userReviewDate": "Aug 21, 2012", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/4365117-emily", "userReview": "Not ready to settle, Sawyer McKettrick finds himself taking a job as Marshal in Blue River, Texas. When he is shot, he finds himself in the care of the town's school teacher, Piper St. James. For the first time in his life, Sawyer wonders if he has met his match. Although Piper is cordial, she also has a spark of temper which he happens to enjoy igniting. As Christmas draws close, so does their feelings for one another and Sawyer doesn't plan to let that feeling go.I am always a sucker for one of Linda Lael Milller's books, they are always fun and have spirited characters that you can't seem to forget. An Outlaw's Christmas is another fantastic read, Piper is head strong and although society still has certain perimeters for women, she finds that there are ways to get around them when others are in need.

His cousin Clay lives nearby and Sawyer is going to take over his job as town marshal for the time being. As soon as he gets off the train, he is shot by an unknown assailant. Spooked, his horse takes off and Sawyer, injured and barely conscious hangs on until the horse come to a stop beside a tiny building in the middle of a raging snowstorm. Sawyer falls from the horse and passes out in the snow.Piper St. James relocated from Maryland to take the job as the schoolmarm in Blue River. Her home consisted of a small room built off the back of the one room schoolhouse. It wasn\u2019t much, but it was all she had. Her cousin Dara Rose had recently been married and sang the praises of Blue River, causing Piper to make the long trek across country to be near her only family. However when she got to Blue River, it wasn\u2019t all she thought it would be so she was saving all her meager earnings to buy a ticket back to Maryland. Everything changed one night in the middle of a snowstorm when she sees a horse standing outside her window. She rushes outside and finds a man, shot and unconscious in the snow at her feet.Using all her strength and resources, Piper manages to drag the man into the schoolhouse and tends to his injuries as best she can. He weaves in and out of consciousness over the next day, but to Pipers relief, he stays alive until help arrives. Clay, Dara Rose\u2019s husband comes to check on her when the weather clears and is shocked to discover his cousin Sawyer passed out on the floor of the schoolhouse. He gets the doctor and they quickly tend to Sawyer\u2019s injuries but determine if they try and move him, Sawyer will not survive the trip so much to Piper\u2019s chagrin, they carry him to her bed and leave her, a single woman and schoolmarm to tend to this stranger\u2019s injuries. Piper is terrified what the town gossips will say about her, but knows helping Sawyer is the right thing to do, so she concedes.As Sawyer slowly recovers, he and Piper slowly grow an awkward situation into a blossoming, sweet romance that ends with true love.An Outlaw\u2019s Christmas is a charming story of hope, dedication and redemption that will have to smiling and bring tears to your eyes. Linda Lael Miller weaves a beautiful Christmas tale that hits all the right notes to warm your heart. This was my first novel by Linda Lael Miller and I was hooked!

Thier are some love scenes in the end of the book. I liked Piper. At first she is timid but then we find out for one of her kids she is tough enough. Its a snowy winter when Sawyer comes to Blue River, TX on the train in 1915. He is riding his horse for a bit of exercise after the train ride they had taken before going to the hotel. When Sawyer feels like someone is watching him and then he hears the shot. He is shot in the left shoulder and his horse takes off. Sawyer stays on till the horse stops right by the school. Sawyer has come to town to take over as sheriff for his cousin Clay. Clay is busy building up his ranch and with a new baby coming wants to stay home more. Sawyer never thought he would be shot before he even got settle in. Piper is from back east and she is teaching at the one room school and living in the back room. As she is going outside to the outhouse She finds Sawyer's horse and then Sawyer. She is able to get him up and into the school but he falls on the floor. Sawyer is more worried about his horse. Piper is unsure what to do. Thier is a blizard and she is afraid she would get lost trying to get help. She gets the horse into the shed and gives him a bucket of snow and wipes him as good as she can. Piper then tends to the wound as best she can even though she does not want to. She uses the special quilts she has to cover him. She is worried that he is an outlaw. Stays up all night watching him. The next morning Clay McKettricks comes in from his ranch to check on her. His wife Dara Rose is Piper's cousin and worried about her. Piper is glad to see him and told him that a man has been shot and is in the school. Clay is surprised to see his cousin and best friend lying on the floor. Clay gets him on Piper's bed and then goes for the doctor. Who is a dentist not a doctor he is always telling people. The Doctor says thier is no way to take him anywhere, it would kill him. The Doctor promises to get things that Piper will need. Clay will be back soon as he can but his wife is 9 months pregnant. Piper is worried that her being single will ruin her chance of marriage someday and she will lose her job. At least the children won't be coming to school until the weather cleared up a bit. I like how Linda tells stories. I have enjoyed her McKittrick family.

This was before the vampire romance genre became big and overdone (thanks a lot, Twilight) and I loved the passion and the darkness of her characters. Nobody does \"bad boy\" like a vampire. So when I read Miller now, I expect that same passion and intensity.Sadly, that was lacking in An Outlaw's Christmas. Okay, it's a Christmas story, so I probably should expect lightness and dreams come true. And that's here, and it's done sweetly. Piper is a school teacher in a small town when a wounded Sawyer McKettrick, who's in town to take over as marshal for his cousin, Clay, shows up on her doorstep, literally. She nurses him back to health with the help of Clay and the local dentist (because there's no doctor in town). She and Sawyer end up getting married because it's improper for a woman to be alone with a man, even under extenuating circumstances like this. Of course, they fall in love and live happily ever after, just like they should in a Christmas story.Here's the thing: Piper and Sawyer's romance was boring. There was no build-up, no excitement. They were in love within a few days of meeting, and Sawyer spent a good portion of those first few days unconscious. We're told Piper is bold early in the book, but aside from a moment when she stands up for someone who needs it, we don't see any boldness. In fact, she marries Sawyer - despite her misgivings - simply because the town busybody decrees that they must. She never once confronts her. As for Sawyer, he decides to not get revenge on the man who ordered that he be shot, but we don't know anything about his thought process, only that tells Piper he loves her now and that she's his family so he doesn't need revenge. But how did he arrive at that conclusion? That's never explored.I've read one or two of Miller's McKettrick series - I read the Christmas one last year, as a matter of fact - and I enjoyed them. This one, though, is entirely forgettable. Not bad, just forgettable. In fact, I finished it last night, and as I write this now I'm already having trouble recalling it enough to review it."}, {"userName": "Arlena", "userReviewDate": "Feb 27, 2013", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/6139982-arlena", "userReview": "Author: \u200cLinda Lael MillerPublished By: HarlequinAge Recommended: AdultReviewed By: Arlena DeanBook Blog For: GMTARating: 4Review:\"An Outlaw's Christmas\" by Linda Lael Miller was a sweet 'McKettrick' historical romance series read that only this author could give to its readers.

The original books are probably still my favorites. This one is more in that time frame than her latest books in the series. Set in in 1915 the main two McKettricks in this book are Sawyer McKettrick and Clay McKettrick(A Lawman's Christmas) sons of Jeb and Kade McKettrick from the original books in this series. It was fun to go back and kind of visit those books. There are some surprise appearances at the end of the book that i was so happy to see. Poor Piper like all books set in what i call way back when she as a school teacher was compromised by doing a good deed and saving Sawyer's life. If she was a man i wouldn't have mattered but back then apparently if you stayed in the same house ( even if it's a school house) with a man who wasn't your husband you were a fallen woman. Never mind the man was half dead from a gun shot wound and had no idea what was going on for hours. Piper had been a orphan and raised with her cousin Dara who was married to Clay McKettrick and convinced Piper to move out to where they lived in Blue River Texas. She took on the job of school teacher but had decided to save her every penny and move back where she came from. All that ends when she finds Sawyer in the snow and drags him in the school house in a blinding snowstorm. Her reputation is ruined the minute she does this but she could not possibly leave him there to die. Sawyer was a body guard of shorts and got tangled up with his boss's wife. He left before things got complicated but the his boss wants him dead. That's why he finds himself shot 5 minutes after getting into town.Which perpetuates the idea he might be a outlaw to Piper when she find him and he's also carrying a gun. I enjoyed this book. You have some danger from the shooter but you have your romance between Sawyer and Piper as they get to know each other. Piper struggles to find herself and her purpose and her place as a married woman. Loved the characters and like i said the surprise at the end. Well worth reading if you love a good western romance but more so if your a fan of the original books in the McKettricks series. 4 out of 5 Modokker Book Picks for An Outlaw's Christmas by Linda Lael Miller."}, {"userName": "Jillian Pearl", "userReviewDate": "Mar 13, 2016", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/47369696-jillian-pearl", "userReview": "I hadn't read any of Linda Lael Miller's work before this. Based on the cover and the blurb (An Outlaw's Christmas) I was surprised to find the story was set in 1915. I didn't mind because I like historical romances, but it would have been nice to have a hint of that in the cover and blurb.That said, the story captured my attention and pushed me to keep reading in order to discover the answers to the questions brought up in the first few pages. In the first half of chapter one, there was a twist that caught me off guard and made me want to know more than ever, what was going on in this tiny town.The school teacher, Miss St. James, lives in a small room behind the classroom in the schoolhouse. One evening during a snow storm she discovers an injured man outside. Forced to decide between helping him, knowing it means destroying her reputation, or leaving him to die, she makes a choice that will forever change her life.The cast of characters that make up the rest of the townsfolk are believable and add depth to the story. Most of them I liked, and one, well two, I hated. I also got a kick out of the old-fashioned phrases that Miss St. James uses.

An Outlaw Christmas throws us right back into the mix of this fabulous family we have all come to love.This story focuses on Sawyer McKettrick and Piper St. James. It takes place in 1915 and gives us a heartwarming tale surrounded by a magical time of year.Sawyer is heading to Blue River to take over the Marshal job from his cousin, Clay. Upon his arrival he is shot and left for dead. Piper finds him nearby the school house that she teaches at, in the midst of a horrible storm. She knows that it\u2019s not proper for her to be alone with this wounded stranger, but she can\u2019t turn her back on him either.After much ridicule from the town folk about her improper behavior, Sawyer presents her with a solution; marry him so the rumors and gossip will stop, and her reputation will be salvaged. She has only known this stranger for a few days, his plan is insane, but somewhere deep inside she knows being married to Sawyer is what she wants and longs for.The characters are sweet and very easy to fall for. Sawyer is sexy, confident, and witty. Piper is headstrong and feisty, yet gentle and caring. When they are together they just complete each other.If you are looking for a book with a lot of drama and conflict/resolve plots, you won\u2019t find it within these pages. This is just a quick read about two strangers who meet under dire circumstances and learn to lean on each other and eventually love each other. There is not a lot of build up with their relationship and their feelings for each other surface rather quickly.

Piper and Sawyer were both wonderful characters. They're compassionate and honest with the perfect touch of fire in them. I really enjoyed watching love sneak up on the pair. And how they dealt the not-so-proper situation they found themselves in after Sawyer landed injured on her doorstep and compromised her reputation. I loved how they were with each other. A touch, a look, a murmured word just when the other needed it. There was such a comfortable, right feeling to the two of them as a couple. An Outlaw's Christmas is just a feel good kinda book. It's short, sweet and warms your heart. I loved the little glimpse into a family full of solid honorable men and bold feisty women. Always a great combination.

It is also the story of a gentle and sneaky sort of love that grows between two unlikely partners, almost forced into a marriage in order to save a woman's reputation, and one that is built on respect and an awareness of the inner beauty that a truly good human being possesses.

This is pure Miller. She has created a great combo in Sawyer and Piper. I really liked Piper's intrepid nature. Sawyer wasn't as fully realized as Piper, but he filled the bill as the good guy.

I certainly hope this has never been published as a separate novel. I didn't know Miller could write this badly. I am surprised she let it be published as is. I have no interest in panning the book in detail. If you think the first novel is worth the cover price, go for it.

There are a few loose threads that aren't followed through at the end or in the epilogue, but it didn't really bother me. The story ended well, but left some openings for another book about the family."}, {"userName": "Crystal", "userReviewDate": "Oct 05, 2012", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/8114559-crystal", "userReview": "I loved this book! Of course I have never meet a Linda Lael Miller book that I did not love. You can never go wrong with one of her books and a Christmas book is a must READ for me. Sawyer McKettrick arrives in Blue River, Texas for the marshal job. He runs into trouble as soon as he arrives and ends up at the school yard. The teacher who is settling in for the a major snow storm finds him there. Piper St. James takes in Sawyer to help him recover. She's a little worried about her reputation but the doctor and Sawyer's cousin convince her to let Sawyer stay until he recovers. Sparks start flying between these two and it's such a cute romance to watch them come together. I really enjoyed this book. Of course like I said I've never meet a Linda Lael Miller book that I didn't love and this one is no different."}, {"userName": "Brad Jae ", "userReviewDate": "Oct 02, 2012", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/7671634-brad-jae", "userReview": "\"An Outlaw's Christmas\" Linda Lael Miller ... Really great book! I found myself reading this book until the crack of dawn!! literally!!!!. I loved the fact that the book wasn't cliche and to over the top. The book was really heartwarming and so funny! I had a couple of laughs along the way. (parents was looking at me really weird for laughing while reading this book!!).
