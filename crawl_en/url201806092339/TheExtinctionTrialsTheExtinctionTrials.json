I could see it all play out before me as I read.I loved both of the main characters, their motives and beliefs. But I think Storm just beat Lincoln in being my favourite. I loved the steady build up of trust and friendship between them, and how a romantic relationship wasn't overshadowing the story,The writing is rich and vivid, the story intense and twisting. The pace of The Extinction Trials is just incredible. I couldn't stop madly turning the pages, wishing I could read faster to keep up. I couldn't help but rush through this, gripped by the story and the action.I did find myself Googling a few of the dinosaurs as they were new to me (I've always been a strictly Triceratops kinda gal with little room for anything else) and it really brought forward the research that had been done.I cannot wait for the next one!"}, {"userName": "Mari", "userReviewDate": "Jun 04, 2018", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/18999155-mari", "userReview": "OMG I\u2019VE BEEN WAITING FOR A BOOK WITH DINOSAURS FOR SUCH A LONG TIME AND NOW THIS IS YA WITH DINOSAURS?!

Imagine my delight when I discovered that dinosaurs are heavily present in the story, I felt super excited to dive into a new adventure. All I will say is, I need the second book please! The Extinction Trials is set in a world where the birth of babies is controlled by the ruling elite and schools don't exist. A set of trials is created to see who can travel to the land of the dinosaurs and collect the highest number of eggs for testing. The winner will receive the best prizes: Unlimited food and lots of money. The characters Storm and Lincoln both want to win but for very different reasons. Their actions and how they survive the brutal trials will change their worlds forever, that is, the dinosaurs don't attack them first.It was an adventurous and brutal ride with great world-building and an array of characters. I'm not quite convinced by the romance at this moment in time but if you love The Hunger Games (which I do) or Jurassic Park (which... I personally haven't seen or read the book for) then The Extinction Trials will be your next favourite book! The pacing wasn't choppy and the ending did leave me wanting more, I thought overall that the last chapter was a great set-up for the next book.

I loved the rush I experienced while reading about this dangerous adventure. It's exactly what it's promised out to be; a mix between Hunger Games and Jurassic Parc!---\nthe Story-line\nReading this story gave me all the Hunger Games feels, in the best way possible. I really liked the twist the author gave to this story even though there are quite some overlapping feels with the hunger games concept - I normally don't like books that have a lot of resemblence to other popular series but this is one of the exceptions. Finalists traveling to this other continent that's been inhabited by dinosaurs, with a lot of them being very dangerous of course. So that's promising, right? RIGHT <3 They're set out to complete a task; find the eggs of these three dangerous species; the T-rex, velociraptor and the pterosaurs. The ones who return with the most eggs, will be granted a luxurious life - whereas the rest of the people on the continent of Earthasia live in poverty, barely survive with what little food there is and the sickness that's spreading throughout the population.So, we're following Stormchaser and Lincoln - I loved reading from different pov's and reading about their different intakes on everything regarding the story-line and it's development - who form a team with some other finalists to expand their chances of succes. Each of them having their own motives to being a part of this group that gets send off to the dinosaur continent. And even though they form a great team, no one is to be trusted...\nthe Writing\nThe author's writing is addictive and vivid. Make sure you don't eat/snack anything while reading, because I can't garantee you'll keep it all inside,lol. Rhere are some really detailed scenes in which you get to read about the predators among the dinosaurs doing what they do best; hunt and killing people. It was awesome! Really! Not so much for some characters obviously, LOL, but I really liked that the author didn't sugarcoat anything and that I got what I was hoping for beforehand; a thrill of a reading experience with dangerous dinosaurs, whoop whoop. ---\nthe Conclusion\nOverall, I thoroughly enjoyed this book. It has crooked politics -as you come to expect with a world building/setting like this one, lots of secrets, adventure, DINOSAURS!!! I mean: DINOSAURS! What's not to love about dinosaurs? Exactly! And there's more than enough of them present, so YAY! Regarding the story-line, it was often quite predictable, and that's why it got a 4 star rating instead of a 5 star rating. But it didn't bother me, because I was so scooped up into this adventure, too excited and extremely curious to explore more of this dinosaur content, to be really bothered by it. It was just awesome and I'm really looking forward to continue this story in the next book; Exile! Seeing how things ended in this first book, it promises to become even more intense in the sequel! If you're a fan of adventure, awesome world building, dinosaurs, vivid writing and fast-paced reads, you need to pick up this book asap!"}, {"userName": "\u265b Garima \u265b", "userReviewDate": "Jun 04, 2018", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/25988362-garima", "userReview": "You would think I would not enjoy Hunger Games rip-off but you'd be wrong.

The book, sadly, doesn\u2019t always live up to the resulting expectations. I have a very distinct impression of The Extinction Trials after finishing it and I\u2019ve already expressed what it is: HALF-BAKED. This book is half-baked, it\u2019s so under-cooked I\u2019m a world-class chef by comparison.Hunger Games? BITE me. Jurassic Park? Nice try.For starters, I found the narration bland. And that, naturally, made everything else bland as well, the characters, their relationships, the story. It wasn\u2019t descriptive enough, it wasn\u2019t detailed enough, it just wasn\u2019t good enough. All telling and no showing. -The book would be like, \u2018this situation is very dangerous\u2019 and I would not feel it, catch my drift? It didn\u2019t make me feel. It told me to feel a certain way and expected that I would but I didn\u2019t because I wasn\u2019t convinced.-Similarly, if we look at the character dynamics, there is a half-baked (that word again) relationship between two people and I say that because again, it wasn\u2019t developed at all but I was supposed to think it was and care. After slight hints and a long nothing, both of the people were like, \u201coh, I feel more about this person than I did before\u2026\u201d and I was like, do you really?Another, rather significant instance of this blandness is the shoddy world-building. That\u2019s right, you heard me. I said shoddy. It\u2019s poorly built and that\u2019s infuriating double-time because the book boasts of being similar to the Hunger Games. Gurl, you can\u2019t hold a match to how impressively the Hunger Games\u2019 world was constructed. Here, though, even though it\u2019s entire continents we\u2019re talking about, the sense of grandness of scale is evidently lacking. There is also no graspable sense of surroundings, the few descriptions we get of the Shelter and housing blocks and tree-top houses was woefully inadequate in conjuring the imagery in my mind.Moreover, it lacks some serious backstory. Dinosaurs exist, deal with it, is what the book appears to say. I caught a single line, ONE SOLITARY LINE, in the entire book that sounded like a potential backstory bit and it said something like this: humans evolved on one continent, Earthasia, while Dinosaurs evolved in another: Piloria. So I\u2019m guessing this isn\u2019t a futuristic dystopian world gone to extra hell, it\u2019s just the way it is? And this by the way, comes up after reading like 2/3 of the book.Also, and more weirdly, even though these people aren\u2019t primitive (they have weapons and buildings and electronics), they have next to no knowledge about dinosaurs? I mean, okay, we\u2019re talking about a vastly different world altogether but that sounds so far-fetched to me. How old is this world that when we get to the current situation of diminishing space, food and power, people still have virtually no idea or knowledge about dinosaurs? Only for the past nine years, since the start of the \u201cTrials\u201d (which I will get to in sweet time) have they begun to get some sort of information about how the dinosaurs live? Which makes NO sense to me because clearly they already know the names of all the dinosaurs! WHAT is the deal? And to make it even more confusing, somewhere in the beginning a scientist announces on behalf of all the others to the population that they\u2019ve discovered the building blocks of life, DNA and they can use this information to get hold of the dinosaur DNA and manufacture some sort of disease that only targets dinosaurs. HOLD THE FUCK UP. You know the names of all dinosaurs, but you don\u2019t know anything about their anatomy or their intelligence, you claim you\u2019ve only just figured out what a blasted DNA is and yet you boast you can manufacture a disease that can kill creatures of a specific DNA straight up. WHERE, IN THE NAME OF ALL THAT IS HOLY, DO YOU EVEN LIVE?\nNow, these awe-inspiring trials. The purpose of these, for the past nine years since they\u2019d been commenced was always to help the people of Earthasia to survive, finding new food sources, mostly and this year, it\u2019s egg-hunting and all the DNA shit so they can wipe out the dinosaurs and take over Piloria as that would give humanity plenty of space, food and other resources. Right. So, why are these trials \u201ctrials\u201d again? Why aren\u2019t they an \u2018expedition\u2019? These are yearly trips and the survival of humanity potentially hinges on them so why the effing heck did they make this a all-serious competition? Not only is this a YA clich\u00e9 and pointless here, it\u2019s incredibly counter-productive, not to mention colossally stupid.\u2022\tThese people know nothing about dinosaurs.\u2022\tAll past expeditions have less than a 10% survival rate.\u2022\tPiloria is an entire fucking continent.\u2022\tCharting the terrain requires food, supplies such as medicine, clothing, weapons and information about what they\u2019re facing.So how is sending a 100 people with no useful bit of knowledge, weaponry and a whole lot of ration they can\u2019t spare, pitted against each other in a competition to find whatever they\u2019re looking for a clever idea? Shouldn\u2019t they be going for, oh I don\u2019t know, stealth? And team work? Okay, so a hundred people cover a lot of ground, okay, they are eventually gonna divide themselves into teams, and okay sending a whole lot of people to what is essentially a suicide mission once every year is a great idea in the grand scheme of things (the less people, the better) but why do you have to make it a \u201ctrial\u201d? That makes it unnecessarily sinister and severe.Some of them are sure as heck going to turn on each other, which again defeats the purpose of working together and trying to survive and be stealthy in a place full of monsters that can smell a cut and chase you for miles and miles. Which happens here. Not only did the Stipulators not give them any coherent bit of information they didn\u2019t even bother to ask the \u2018contestants\u2019 to be discreet and quiet and perhaps not kill each other?They add this tournament/arena-fighting/trials/games shit in every book now even if it makes no sense.\nThe main protagonist\u2019s name is \u201cStormchaser Knux\u201d\u2026.\u2026\u2026\u2026\u2026\u2026\u2026\u2026\u2026\u2026\u2026\u2026\u2026\u2026\u2026\u2026\u2026\u2026\u2026\u2026\u2026\u2026\u2026\u2026\u2026\u2026\u2026\u2026\u2026\u2026\u2026\u2026\u2026\u2026\u2026\u2026\u2026\u2026\u2026\u2026\u2026\u2026\u2026.\u2026\u2026\u2026\u2026\u2026\u2026\u2026\u2026\u2026\u2026\u2026\u2026\u2026\u2026\u2026.\u2026\u2026\u2026\u2026\u2026\u2026\u2026\u2026\u2026\u2026\u2026..\u2026\u2026\u2026\u2026\u2026\u2026\u2026\u2026..\u2026\u2026\u2026\u2026\u2026\u2026\u2026\u2026\u2026\u2026\u2026..\u2026.While the second one\u2019s name is Lincoln.Stormchaser has violet eyes. Sure, it\u2019s a strange world people can have violet eyes, yeah? Except the color is apparently unusual even for people who come from far reaches of Earthasia so she\u2019s most likely the only one with eyes this color. She has no parents, mother died a few years ago, never met her father, her mother didn\u2019t allow mention of him. Usually that\u2019s a sign the father is alive and evil. So who else could have violet eyes but the chief Stipulator sending a hundred people to die on a deadly continent? This guy gives her weird looks throughout the book, this coupled with the fact that they both have the same \u201cunusual\u201d eyes, it still took someone else politely mentioning it for her to realize that this guy may be her father. Not the ripest apple on the tree, this girl.The moral dilemma going side by side with all this, was honestly not appealing. You need the space, you need the food, you need new resources, medicine and a shitload of things your continent has run out of. People have been dying of a Plague (without being quarantined?) so colonizing Piloria is possibly the only choice they\u2019ve got left. But noooo. Storm\u2019s like, we\u2019ll just leave the dinosaurs alone and let the humans all die and suffer. If you\u2019ve got any bright ideas, girl, humanity is listening.However, I am interested to know what the writer\u2019s solution to this is.If there\u2019s an no-man\u2019s land filled with dangerous creatures and certain death at every step, chances are there\u2019s a lone survivor living there for years and years who\u2019ll conveniently show up and save your ass from being eaten by said dangerous creatures. Hello, Kong Skull Island.The guy had a proper reason to be there but I was annoyed by everything in this book. And finally, let me talk about how abrupt and anti-climactic the ending is. The last couple of contestants are subjected to a pointless \u2018trial\u2019 yet again which involves swimming, climbing a cliff and throwing knives at people. This particular part screamed \u2018half-baked\u2019. It\u2019s was such a sloppy, spur-of-the-moment, \u2018put there just for thrills\u2019 thing, it made me eye-roll extra hard. The winner found a loophole so the losers could win as well which only just proved the pointlessness of it all.Suffice to say, I\u2019m pretty pissed at this book.P.S: Grudgingly giving it 3 stars which is actually 2 point something because the writing was bearable and I read this quick."}, {"userName": "Britt", "userReviewDate": "May 06, 2018", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/13514770-britt", "userReview": "Looooved this!

HOWEVER, I am SO glad that I did, because it is amazing, fantastic, incredible, brilliant, everything! This book is now one of my favourite books because it is just so inventive and different and just enjoyable to read! When it read this, I felt like Piloria was an actual place out there somewhere, and it was so beautiful in my mind. Everything about this book is great, from the beautiful cover, to the interesting characters, to the intense main story; it\u2019s just amazing. I love both the main characters: Stormchaser and Lincoln (I have to admit, that I like Storm a little more), they\u2019re both just an interesting pair of characters, who are contrasting but complement each other at the same time. I also found it interesting that the book is told from both their perspectives but seems to be more of a story about Storm. I loved all the characters, apart from Galen of course, although I love the way he was portrayed. All the character names were so creative and different, I loved that! That was one of the main features of the book that made me feel like I was really in a different world and time with these people, living in a deprived world, with dinosaurs only a boat ride away. The names gave the book a certain element that other books don\u2019t have, which just adds to the amazingness! Th story itself was dramatic, intense, compelling and just down right awesome. I love the concept; living in a world that\u2019s so deprived and overpopulated that the human race want to wipe out the dinosaur continent of Piloria in able to survive. The journey we follow with Storm, Lincoln and their friends is emotional and action packed, and never once felt boring. It was also actually quite gory which took me by surprise! But I felt that this just made the book even better as the scenes were so detailed, well written and I just felt that they were perfectly spread throughout the book, so there wasn\u2019t too much or too little. The dinosaurs were awesome, well described and just fun to read about. It didn\u2019t end how I had expected it to, which I guess is only a good thing. It was simple, but I felt this was a perfect end to their story, and left it nicely open for the sequel. Overall, this book is just incredible, exciting and the perfect novel for dystopian fans who want to try something different. I am amazed by how much I loved this book, and it might be a little early to say, but I think this will be one of my favourite books of the year!"}, {"userName": "Kelly", "userReviewDate": "Feb 03, 2018", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/37317910-kelly", "userReview": "Actual rating- 4.5 stars. This book is advertised as The Hunger Games meets Jurassic Park and that's certainly true. The chapters are told in more or less alternate chapters between Stormchaser and Lincoln, who both have their own reasons for wanting to take part in the journey to Piloria, the dinosaur planet. I related to Storm wanting her own space and hating being in a crowded place, as resources on their home, including space, are scarce. Other secondary characters were all different and there should be some interesting things come up in the next book, particularly relating to Storm. One thing I noticed about the names of Leif, Rune and Kronar were that they came from a different place to most of the others and, if I'm right, their names come from various Scandinavian sources. Leif named after Leif Eriksson, the first person to discover Vinland/America; Rune from the old Nordic runes that made up the alphabet; and Kronar is a variation on the currencies of Norway, Sweden and Denmark. There were a huge mix of dinosaurs in this book, both herbivores and the ones who would gladly eat humans. Storm named one of the friendlier ones Milo and I loved him- they have a history which is explained well and it stands in contrast to everything the people are told of dinosaurs being mindless and who only eat people. The Trial finalists find this out first hand when they get on Piloria and meet ones such as T-Rex's. I definitely would not want to end up on Piloria, no matter how different and beautiful it is! The only thing I found a little annoying at times was the way little bits of information seemed to be repeated once or twice in various places over the course of the book, which didn't seem necessary. But overall, it was a fun read, with the different parts of the book split up into sections as well, and I'm very much looking to the second book coming out later this year, in summer."}, {"userName": "Alessandra Crivelli", "userReviewDate": "Jan 15, 2018", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/31870334-alessandra-crivelli", "userReview": "**THE FULL REVIEW IS COMING** DAMNED THIS WAS SO FREAKING GOOD!\"The Extinction Trials\" is literally a Jurassic Park meets Hunger Games story: we live in a world where the dinosaurs exist during the human-era.

You know the ones. I read this book weeks ago, and it's taken ages to put thoughts into words.\u00a0So instead of a coherent review, here are my top 5 reasons for loving\u00a0The Extinction Trials.Stormchaser & LincolnWilson could not have picked better main characters for her novel. We're told the story in (almost) alternating chapters by Storm and Lincoln.Storm is an orphan, living in government housing. She loves the outdoors so much she'll willing dumb down her scores at school so she can continue working outside. She cares about one person, Dell. While everyone is scared of the water, she swims in a lake with her dinosaur buddy. And to top it off, she is curious and questions everything, especially the things the government wants her to believe. I love her.On the other hand, Lincoln doesn't care about the dinosaurs, not really. All he cares about is getting his family the healthcare and food that they need. He's observant and prepared, steady and sure. Plus, he's one of those people who just gets on with other people, you know? I am in awe of those people.Which brings us to my next point...The relationshipsYes, there is something brewing between Storm and Lincoln. What did you expect? BUT you know what? Wilson didn't let it overpower the story. There was something slowly building in the background, but it wasn't the main focus. Both characters had to much else to worry about than each other, and it was more a growing of trust than of romantic feelings. There are too many hurdles in this book and in the future for a real romance to bloom easily.However, that's not the only relationship in this book. I liked Dell and Storm's friendship, how they were\u00a0tight. I do hope there's a bit more about their friendship in the next book, because Dell could be developed some more. Then there were the friendships between the trio from the north, who worked as a team and had each other's backs, even when the worst happened.And then there's the whole complicated thing going on with Lincoln and his family, the admirable dedication that leads to tough choices during the book. It left me with mixed feelings about him...Science!Basically, I love biology and evolutionary science. So a YA novel that takes me into a rich world with dinosaurs is going to be a winner. I mean, it would be tough to fail with dinosaurs. I liked the variety in the book, even though I did have to do some googling for a couple of the species. I also loved the debate about dinosaur intelligence, which can be extrapolated to animal intelligence in general, and whether we have the right to kill them and take over their land.The world-buildingOk, so which would you prefer? This...Or this?Wilson painted an interesting picture with her two continents, one overpopulated with humans and very little else. The other was lush and vibrant...and filled with dinosaurs. I could see it all in my mind.My heart rateBut amongst all of the greenery, Wilson kept a sense of danger and suspense. Everything could be a threat, both dinosaurs and humans. While the first half was just build-up (fair enough), the second half of\u00a0The Extinction Trials\u00a0kept me on high alert, right through to the very last page. No one was safe, even when you thought it was over. Somehow Wilson managed to get my heart racing in the final pages while still ending this first book in the series in a satisfying way.\u00a0\nMAGIC\n.So yes, I've already added book 2 to my Goodreads TBR.\u00a0I received this book for free in exchange for an honest review.

The human continent is hugely overcrowded leaving the people struggling for food, water, energy, accommodation, everything. In a bid to save their race, the humans decide they need to learn more about the dinosaur continent of Piloria in order to take it for themselves. This is where the Extinction Trials come in: a Hunger Games style contest where 100 people are sent to Piloria and encounter a number of gruelling missions and tasks (and that\u2019s aside from the dinosaurs!). I really don\u2019t want to say any more than that about the plot but let me assure you it will keep you flipping those pages and twisting and turning until the very end!I really liked the characters in this book. The story itself is told from two POVs: Stormchaser is our leading lady. Storm\u2019s upbringing has been far from easy but her character says it all. She is independent, sassy, fiercely determined and competitive but she is also loyal, compassionate and intelligent. I absolutely adored reading her chapters and I especially loved the way she saw the dinosaurs. Lincoln, our other POV, hasn\u2019t had the same difficult start to life as Storm but has much more to lose due to an ill younger sibling. He has a lot more weighing on the outcome of the trials than Storm does and it\u2019s interesting to see how that dynamic pans out during the story.Of course, there are plenty of secondary characters involved in the story too from some competitive villain types to Storm\u2019s best friend Dell but my favourites of all had to be the blinking dinosaurs. I mean when do we ever find YA books with dinosaurs in? I just loved reading about them and got excited every time a new one was mentioned. Plus, not all of the dinosaurs were terrifying beasts (although plenty of them were!) and I really liked that this was shown too. An element that really interested me was the way in which Wilson set about showing a varied attitude among the human characters towards the dinosaurs. Some of the characters hate the dinosaurs and want nothing more than to see them all dead, others are interested but rightfully wary and a few believe that the dinosaurs should be treated just as the humans would want to be: with respect. I really liked how this was gently explored through the dialogue and reactions of the characters.The world building is absolutely exquisite! I felt like I was stepping into a full formed world that was vivid and easy to imagine thanks to the gorgeous writing. I felt like I was stepping through the pages into Piloria with Storm, Lincoln and the others for the first time too. Every step they took in their dangerous new surroundings both thrilled and terrified me: I really didn\u2019t know what would happen next but I loved every second of it!The ending of this book was superb! It has perfectly set up for the next book in the series and the surprises kept coming at me from all directions right up until the end. I really, really loved this book, the characters, the concept, the world building, everything about it was fascinating and exciting. It\u2019s a book I know I will read over and over again. Marvellous!"}, {"userName": "Carien", "userReviewDate": "Jan 28, 2018", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/3817527-carien", "userReview": "When I saw this book is marketed as 'Hunger Games meets Jurassic Park' I had to give it a try.The story is set in a world where humans and dinosaurs live at the same time. Earthasia. the continent where the humans live, is getting crowded and food is getting scarce, so they have set their eyes on the continent Piloria. One problem: it's full of dinosaurs.When a trial is being organised to see who would be fit to go on an expedition to Piloria lots of people enter. Some - like Storm - for the food the entrants get, others - like Lincoln - for the promised rewards those who actually make it through the trials will get.The first part of the book is about the trials. I liked getting to know Storm and Lincoln, and the trials were fun to read about as well. Still I was waiting for the moment they would get to Piloria, as I wanted some dinosaur action.And when the story finally gets them to Piloria I was not disappointed. There's lots of action, perils, and of course dinosaurs! I especially rooted for Storm to succeed in her plans and to survive the dangers of Piloria. The scenes with the dinosaurs were thrilling and had me on the edge of my seat.The book ended in a way that makes it readable as a standalone, but it also left me hungry for more. You bet I will get my trotters on the next book once it releases."}, {"userName": "Monica Haak", "userReviewDate": "May 26, 2018", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/36693065-monica-haak", "userReview": "omg I loved this!!!echt een boek wat ik al als film zie gebeurenrecensie binnenkort op myperfectbooklife!"}, {"userName": "Farhina \u21af\u21af The Wanderer Of Inked Adventures", "userReviewDate": "Dec 08, 2017", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/29246481-farhina-the-wanderer-of-inked-adventures", "userReview": "My rating: 4.5 out of 5 stars.\n\"HUNGER GAMES MEETS JURASSIC PARK.\"\nYes, you read this right! The tag line of this books is indeed that sentence. I have no idea about you but when I read those words I was like heck yeah need it in my life! Imagine me freaking-ly typing my yes yes yes to the available review copy email.Anyway. The Extinction Trials is a story about a fictional earth where humans and dinosaurs exist together at the same time. But on two different continents. The humans occupy Earthasia and the dinosaurs occupy Piloria.The humans as they do (clears throat) over used and mistreated their land. And now keep looking towards Piloria to solve their food, land and accommodation problems. Sigh yeah typical human thing to do. Destroy other for their own needs.The two main characters of this book are Lincoln and Storm Chaser. The story told in their dual perspective with alternatively voiced chapters They both are starkly different from each other. Lincoln is nice and caring but he also had this determined streak to him to get things done and complete his mission. He seems to have a lot of inner struggle going on.Storm chaser I quite like her and connected to her. Alone, on Earthasia because her mother has died and she has no other family she has quite a shield around her. She has a lot of compassion(not just for humans but for other creatures, for earth for her environment) and emotions. She constantly questions things around her and notices a lot. She is strong, adventurous independent and driven. Also a dinosaur is her best friend ( I mean winnnnnnnn).With some twist and turns and some survival needs or adventurous need (counting of the character you talk about) Lincoln and Storm Chaser and well a few others (100 to be exact) end up on Piloria with a special little task to complete....The story is full of action, drama, survival and......... betrayal. It highly fast paced and very unput down able.The world building and imagery is top class and it is done so beautifully. The dinosaurs were researched so well and I loved that she didn't stick to general research she did add different to bits of her to the dinosaurs and made them different. The description of the world, the forests, the sea at Piloria ....the buildings, the stuffy environment at leaves a very well sketched world in your mind.Yes as some stories go its also very quite predictable sometimes. But also brutal. You will loose quite a lot of characters by the time you are done with us so yeah.Also another thing about the dual voices was you could see how Stormchaser see the dinosaurs. With compassion and with respect she doesn't think of them as mindless predators. Where Lincoln thinks exactly that. It's intriguing to see as their journey through the story progress and to see them go through their beliefs and questions things around them.One of my only complaint would be I would have liked them to spend more time on Piloria The place was so beautiful ( and deadly) I just wish I could have read more about it (ahh maybe the sequel will full fill my need for that land)This book is vivid. And with a lot of twist and turns by the last chapter you are left breathless for the sequel because you are left with a bang and really need some answers so yeah for me the waiting game beings. For you? You should totally try this book out. I mean come out. DINOSAURS. KICK ASS FEMALE LEAD. NEW WORLD. POLITICS. PUNY HUMANS.Well what more I can say.

Medische zorg is nauwelijks beschikbaar, mensen hebben honger omdat voedsel schaars is en ze werken in shifts om zo de bewoning van huizen te kunnen verdelen. Oplossing biedt het andere continent Piloria, alleen is dat het terrein van gevaarlijke dinosauri\u00ebrs. De regering komt met een idee en heeft hiervoor vrijwilligers nodig. Storm en haar beste (en enige) vriend Dell zijn net oud genoeg om zich aan te melden en de gedachte aan een paar dagen lang een volle buik door vorstelijke maaltijden, zorgt ervoor dat ze zich aanmelden. Er zijn tal van aanmeldingen en deze eerste beproeving zal vrijwilligers elimineren. Geen probleem voor Storm en Dell, omdat die stiekem alleen voor het eten gaan. De zware proeven zien ze als bijkomstigheid, een volle buik is het belangrijkst! Dan blijkt dat Storm het beter heeft gedaan dan verwacht en de groep van 100 winnaars wordt naar Piloria gebracht. Hun taak is om zoveel mogelijk eieren van dino's mee terug te nemen naar Earthasia. De winnaar zal rijkelijk beloond worden... Ondanks dat dino's en gevaarlijke beproevingen zeker niet nieuw zijn in de boekenwereld, is Susan Wilson erin geslaagd om een tof boek neer te zetten. Het begint wat standaard, maar neemt als snel wendingen die erg leuk zijn en die je ook zeker niet altijd aan ziet komen. Storm is wees en leert tijdens deze beproeving wat het is om andere mensen in je wereld te laten. Vriendschappen bloeien op, maar tegelijkertijd huist er gevaar, manipulatie en verraad. Want niet alleen zitten de deelnemers elkaar op de hielen om als eerst de eieren terug te kunnen brengen, maar ook schuilen de gevaarlijke dinosauri\u00ebrs in de dichtbegroeide bossen.Het is zeker niet het meest originele plot, maar de realistische kijk op de dino's en de geloofwaardige acties van de deelnemers laten je hart smelten en zorgen ervoor dat je door wil lezen. Ook is het verademing om eens een Young Adult te lezen waarin liefde n\u00ed\u00e9t het middelpunt van het boek is!Het is erg fijn en toegankelijk geschreven en het verhaal vlot snel. De personages zijn leuk en geloofwaardig. Ze worden in mate uitgediept, wat genoeg ruimte geeft om hier in het tweede deel, wat in juni 2018 uitkomt, verder op in te gaan. Je nieuwsgierigheid en verlangen wordt in The Extinction Trials n\u00e9t genoeg gevoed. Goede manier om je uit te laten kijken naar een tweede boek! Verwacht geen boek waarin dino's tot op het bot uitgediept worden, want dan wordt je teleurgesteld. Maar heb je zin in een leuk Young Adult boek dat je door de pagina's laat razen? Dan is The Extinction Trials een absolute aanrader! 4*."}, {"userName": "Kate Ormand", "userReviewDate": "Oct 25, 2017", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/7481046-kate-ormand", "userReview": "An action-packed, breathless adventure story about the fight for survival in a dystopian world where humans exist alongside dinosaurs.

Having read and loved both The Hunger Games AND Jurassic Park, I was both incredibly excited and extremely wary when picking this book up. Would it meet my expectations or would it end up as a disappointment? Most importantly...would it have enough dinosaurs? The Extinction Trials is set in a world where humans and dinosaurs coexist, but in different continents. While humans live in the overpopulated Earthasia, the beautiful hub of nature, Piloria, is where the dinosaurs reign. Earthasia is under the control of a strict government that has rationed all resources such as food, water, housing and energy in order to meet demands, and one day the government decides to take over Piloria for themselves so colonies could be developed there. The catch? Dinosaurs. It is decided on that dinosaurs would be exterminated from Piloria and it is in pursuit of this that the Extinction Trials was born. Volunteers are sent to Piloria in order to find information about the dinosaurs on what is practically a suicide mission, and this book follows their journey to Piloria and how they survive there...or do they?What I loved most about the book was the world-building. Be it the crowded, bleak Earthasia or the wonderfully lush, green Piloria, the author has built up a very vivid world and you'd no doubt find yourself conjuring up everything as you read it. And dinosaurs, yes. From relatively harmless herbivores to the ruthless, blood-thirsty predators, the author makes it clear that a lot of research has gone into creating this world. The writing was rich, the pace was very consistent and there's not much I have to complain in this department. However, it was when it came to the characters and relationships that I felt less than satisfied and this is largely due to the fact that the author spent more time in worldbuilding than in us getting to know the characters. Perhaps a lttle more showing rather than telling would have done the trick?I liked the characters individually, and while Stormchaser was my favourite (I loved how secure she was being on her own), I couldn't help but feel we could have gotten to know everyone else better- not even the deaths were impactful and that shows how little we were attached to the characters. Lincoln and Dell both sufficed as the love interest (and a main character) and friend respectively, but the question certainly rises as to whether the romance angle was entirely necessary in this book. I hope the sequel offers more in the way of romance and relationships, including the familial ones which really could have done with some exploring here. It certainly doesn't help that they were rushing around with dinosaurs at their feet for most part of the latter half of the book. That brings me to my other concern- there weren't enough dinosaurs! Or at least, not enough action involving dinosaurs. What was done was done pretty well, but I would have definitely appreciated a bit more adrenaline-pumping action scenes. This could have been fixed had the characters spent more time in Piloria, or had the twists come more frequently, but the book ultimately fell short on the suspense factor and that sometimes took away from the pleasure of reading an otherwise very engaging book.All in all, I'd say The Extinction Trials was a thrilling read that set itself pretty high standards to live up to...which it didn't quite. I loved the ending though I don't really see why Storm did what she did (nope, no spoilers), and I'm still very much looking forward to see how the story progresses, so bring on the sequel already! Just make sure we have more of dinosaurs, action and meaningful relationships, yes?

But I feel like my main issue, and it's probably just me, but I struggled to form a solid connection with the characters. I just didn't find myself caring that much for them.

When it said it\u2019s Hunger Games meets Jurassic Park they weren\u2019t kidding! Such an intense, heart racing, keeps you on the edge of your seat, amazing book! I loved the dual POVs. Loved both Storm and Lincoln and the rest of their team. At times it was absolutely terrifying. Those dinosaurs omg I would never want to go anywhere near them. But I also loved reading about the dinosaurs it\u2019s so interesting to imagine what life would be like if they were still alive. There\u2019s so many unanswered questions and i so need to get my hands on the next book already! I hope we get to find out a bit more of how earthasia became the way it is in the next book."}, {"userName": "Louise", "userReviewDate": "Jan 20, 2018", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/30031460-louise", "userReview": "A roaring adventure, and a great political dystopia. The Extinction Trials is a fast-paced adventure which looks at the true cost of damaging the natural world.I like the conflict between Storm and Lincoln\u2019s motives \u2013 Lincoln says family comes first, but Storm wants to do what is right for the world. This conflict made me read on to see whether one would betray the other. It is great to see dinosaurs in YA, and the setting was perfect for the theme. Fast-paced and intelligent, this will leave you desperate for the sequel."}], "description": "Betrayal. Sacrifice.
