She is witty, witty, witty! I was mesmerized with the first few chapters, kept greedily turning the pages. But then I realized that things were getting shallower and shallower instead of deeper and deeper. It was like walking into a pool expecting to swim once you hit the deep end and discovering that you're wading in the kiddie pond. All of a sudden, it was clear that I didn't genuinely like any of the characters and that everyone--everyone!--seemed to be sour and/or dour and/or unhappy. I didn't like the way the author described relationships between men and women, or between women and women, or between really anyone and anyone! She talked about the thin veneer of bitchiness that coats almost all female interactions. Really? Girls, really? At best, this book seems to treat very dark personal secrets as kind of a universal joke-is-on-us thing. At worst, it might trivialize violence against women, marital infidelity, and lying.The epilogue is the worst I've ever read, bar none. The author manages to simultaneously deconstruct the very themes upon which her book stands, and then introduces several \"plot twists\" that only frustrated and semi-enraged me. You're going to tell us that now? Why? Why?? Then she lightly flits off with a neat, knowing, witty reference to the beginning of her book and the thing is over. I was totally like, what?? Take a cue from Paul Harvey, lady. He knew how to do that whole \"And now you know the rest of the story\" thing. You do not."}, {"userName": "Mitch", "userReviewDate": "Nov 05, 2013", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/2604131-mitch", "userReview": "Wow. I have been so ashamed of many of the newest Best Sellers that have been released. And this hunk of garbage can be added to this list. This year so far has been an overall bummer for me in finding good reads and yikes...I wish I could get my money back. For real.\"The Husband's Secret\" by Liane Moriarty sounds awesome in theory. A woman finds a hidden letter written years ago by her loyal husband that contains a secret that could change or ruin many lives. It also follows two other women and their stories of love and heartbreak.BLECH. Predictability, weak characters, no character development, and just full to the brim of everything yucky. The characters are not likable at all and I couldn't relate to any of them. These women are wretchedly annoying.Alright, people might think \"Mitch, you are a male reader, and you don't fall into the demographic, so you are an unfair judge\". However, as humiliating as it may be, I am a fan of Harlequin, the king of the mass produced romance lady novel. However, most of those mass produced books are WAY better than this chart topping hooey. Some women will eat it up, but i found it poorly written, repetitive, and so predictable that it's laughable.Try it if you want, but if you want to save yourself massive amounts of boredom, then use it as kindling.

When she casually mentions it to him on the phone, his reaction makes it clear that the last thing he wants is for her to open that envelope - but why?Leaving us with this intriguing puzzle, the story then jumps to another woman, Tess, whose husband has fallen in love with someone else. Shocked and distraught, Tess makes immediate plans to go and stay with her mother in Sydney, taking her young son with her. Then we move onto a third woman, Rachel, whose much loved daughter died many years previously and whose life now centres on her grandson. Shortly, the three women's lives will intersect and the secret that Cecilia's husband has been guarding for so long will impact on them all. Despite strong word of mouth, I wasn't expecting a lot from this book, having once tried to read another by this Australian author and giving up on it. But I absolutely devoured The Husband's Secret. From the first chapter I was gripped and I read it in two sittings. I worried about the characters - I even woke up in the middle of the night wondering how the author could possibly resolve the events that she'd set in motion. This isn't epic literature by any means, but it's incredibly readable and totally gripping - the kind of book you want for a long plane flight."}, {"userName": "Emily May", "userReviewDate": "Dec 21, 2013", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/4622890-emily-may", "userReview": "Some secrets are meant to stay secret forever. Just ask Pandora.\nThe Husband's Secret is a decent book, but I honestly expected to enjoy it a lot more than I did. I love mysteries that focus on the characters and their relationships with each other; and I love reading about morally questionable people, especially women. I find complex relationships between women to be fascinating - woven with friendship, jealousies and secrets - but I found this book superficial and, at times, even boring.Firstly, the titular \"secret\" is not a mystery and is so easy to guess immediately that I was hoping it would be something else. Secondly, I think the \"secret\" and the details behind it are not very interesting and - despite it being a serious issue - it doesn't feel particularly scandalous or exciting. You open this book just like Pandora opening her box/jar, promised this huge secret by the title and blurb, and yet for me it was very anticlimactic.It gets three stars because Moriarty writes about selfish, depressed and troubled middle-class women very well. The dialogue and dynamics between them are funny, entertaining and contain those rare pieces of human honesty that only a few authors can achieve - little thoughts, feelings or behaviours that are personal and strange, but instantly recognizable and true. In reality, the human reaction to certain situations - discovering a dark secret, being dumped for someone else, etc. - is not often what we think it should be. It's like when you play out meeting someone famous in your head and you think you know exactly what you would do, until you meet them and your plans fly out the window. In this book, I get the sense that Moriarty has tapped into real human reactions and behaviour - these women don't always feel and behave in a typical or conventional way, and yet it seems all the more real because of it.But interesting character studies aside, it did get tiresome after a while. When you strip away the not so interesting mystery, this is a book about the relationships of a bunch of privileged middle-class woman. And there's really only so much of that I can take before I start losing interest.Blog | Facebook | Twitter | Instagram | Tumblr"}, {"userName": "Kristin (KC) - Traveling Sister", "userReviewDate": "Dec 06, 2014", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/4971692-kristin-kc---traveling-sister", "userReview": "[Yes, but it\u2019s certainly not conventional.

Full disclosure: I listened to this as an audiobook. Normally I save my audiobooks for cleaning house, but this was so good I took it on runs, slowed down my walks to work, even listened for a few minutes as I got my coffee, ignoring my coworkers. The reader's Australian accent made the story come alive, but I bet it's just as spellbinding in print. Two husbands in this book have secrets: one predictable, quickly revealed; the other unexpected and drawn out. Each time I thought I knew where the story was going, I was thrown off. I'd like to be cool and literary and say that everything got tied up too neatly in the end, that this is a book too obviously pandering to women of my age (40) and station in life (married with children, working hard, somewhat comfortable) but honestly, I just enjoyed the hell out of it. It asked nothing of me, and delivered a story that held me through the satisfying (if slightly too convenient) conclusion.

Three unlikable women are the main characters in this novel.Cecilia is a ninny. She finds this letter in the attic addressed to her, only to be opened when her husband dies. He's not dead. She spends the first half of the book waffling between should-I-open-it/should-I-not. It's annoying. Meanwhile, she runs through every scenario she can think of and also fantasizes about what every single family member and friend would advise her to do.Then she finally opens the letter and spends the second half of the book waffling about what to do with the information it contains. Needless to say, I found this character to be very frustrating.Tess is a woman experiencing the ultimate betrayal - her husband is in love with her cousin. Her cousin who is so close to her they are like twin sisters. She flees to another city with her 6-year-old son to rethink her life.Rachel is consumed with rage and grief since her daughter was found murdered in a park a few decades ago. This rage and grief frankly makes her a huge jerk. She hates her daughter-in-law for no discernible reason and is a real jerk to her. Also, after her daughter was killed she pretty much just ignored her poor son. So he's grown up really almost estranged from her. I didn't like her.....This book is just chock full of guilt and suffering. Oh, pain, suffering, guilt! Punishment from God!!! Isn't that what life is all about? Um, no, it isn't. And it isn't really what I want to read about either.This book had other problems as well....1.) FEMALE-ON-FEMALE HATEWhat is WITH books/movies/tv trying to convince me that women are bitches? I certainly don't talk to my friend nicely and then immediately think hateful comments about her. Every single woman in this book was like:\"Hi, Joan! Oh, what a lovely dress you have on. Are you coming to the party Saturday?\"Internal thoughts: Wow, I hate Joan. She is skinnier than me. Also she makes great potato salad. That angers me because I buy my potato salad instead of homemaking it!Or some such shit like that. WTF? I really don't know many women who are like this. A very small percentage. What is the deal with making us all look like backstabbing hate-filled competitors? This is not how I feel about other women at all. :( Reading this kind of stuff makes me sad. Characters in this book do this to close friends, family members, distant acquaintances... any other woman in the vicinity.2.) FAT-HATEAccording to this book, fat women are like the most tragic, horrifying people on Earth. They are like the victims of some horrible disfiguring tragedy that makes children cry and people avert their eyes. No man in their right mind would ever date/touch/have sex with/kiss one unless he was a.) very charitable or b.) a 'fat freak' who 'chases chubby women.' (No mention/comments on fat men, which I thought was interesting.)I was practically laughing my ass of at this. Fat women have sex. They get married. Men fall in love with them. Despite what the media tells you, fat women have sex/dates/love just like anyone else. Almost every single fat woman I know is in a healthy, loving relationship with a \"normal\" (meaning: not a \"chubby chaser\" or loser or whatever scraps people think fat women end up with) guy. It would never even occur to me to think, \"She can't get a date because she's fat\" because in my experience fat women get a lot of play. So fuck this shit! Don't believe a word of what this book tells you. You don't have to look like a Victoria's Secret ad to get a husband.Whenever I read a book filled with fat hate, I am confused. Even if the author is not fat herself, doesn't she have fat people she loves and admires and relies on in her life? Her grandma? Her mom? Her aunt? Her cousin? Her best friend? Her favorite librarian? It's extra-weird with this book because fat/overweight men are NEVER MENTIONED - as if they simply don't exist, or if they do it's not an issue because they're not women.Actually, this book is very appearance focused when it comes to women. Not just being thin, but are you wearing make-up? Stylish clothes? Trying to look your best like you should? I didn't like it. Basically it was saying that getting a husband and having kids and being a mom is THE ONLY IMPORTANT THING in life. Yes, it is very important, but so is some other stuff. 3.) EMOTIONAL MANIPULATIONThis book is one of those books that is trying to \"slam you with feels,\" as they say on GR. Moriarty is very emotionally manipulative. Children get hurt, badly. A teenaged girl is murdered. A husband chooses to cheat on his wife with her cousin/best friend. A woman loses over a hundred pounds and goes through a radical transformation. Blah blah blah, tug on your heartstrings, blah blah blah.Listen, I don't appreciate this. I know some people LOVE going to movies that make them cry. They know the movie is going to make them cry, and that makes them excited. I AM NOT THIS TYPE OF PERSON. If I feel like the author is trying to grab me by the ovaries and wrest some emotion out of me, I don't get weepy. I get angry. What's your point? Really. What is the point of this book? Yeah, it has no point.4.) EPILOGUEThe thing that most illustrates how pointless this book is is the frustrating and anger-inducing epilogue, in which Moriarty breaks down about 85 different what-if possibilities. What if little Bobby didn't choose to ride his bike to the corner store that day? What if Jeannie wore a red dress instead of a blue one? What if Juan bought a motorcycle instead of an engagement ring for his girlfriend? OMG, everything would have changed! Life would be so different! OMG! Doesn't that blow your mind?!!?!?!*crickets chirping*NO! No, it doesn't blow my mind! None of that shit happened! What is the point of standing around all day and talking for six hours about what COULD have happened? It DIDN'T happen. That's the point. What happened is what actually happened. Yes, things could have gone a thousand different ways. BUT THEY DIDN'T. It's not like this is a time travel book where you could go back and change something. Now that would be cool. Then, in that case, I would be on board with analyzing different possibilities and their outcomes. But Moriarty's world is already set in stone, so I find this a rather morbid, heartrending, pointless exercise - a kind of non-stop weepy circle jerk that was annoying and added NOTHING to the story - and in fact made it worse. Due to something revealed in the epilogue, the whole book and plot is basically negated. It sucks....Tl;dr - Emotionally manipulative fiction aimed at women. Promotes woman-on-woman hate, fat-shaming, and a very middle-class, nuclear family is everything, my-husband-and-my-children-are-my-whole-life worldview. Typical. Just very, very typical of this genre. Nothing new or exciting. Nothing fresh or interesting. Avoid unless you like TFIOS, Nicholas Sparks, and \"chick-lit\" that is the heavy kind which tries to deal with serious issues....OLD REVIEWI don't think I can finish it.Here's what I said to Kat Stark about it:I don't think I'm cut out for manipulative heart-wrenching stuff. I feel the author is trying to make me feel all maudlin. It's the same feeling I get from TFIOS or Nicholas Sparks. There's so many \"chick-lit\" (hate that term) stereotypes in here: a woman's husband falls in love with her cousin (a cousin who was once obese but now tiny) so we've got he's-cheating-with-my-sister(cousin)/she-lost-all-the-weight.Then we have a woman who finds a secret envelope addressed to her from her husband \"to be opened upon the event of my death\" and you don't know what's in it but you know it's really bad. They stopped having sex six months ago and she doesn't know what's wrong.Then there's a grandmother who's 17-year-old daughter was murdered by a boy(friend) years ago. She's grieving and obsessed with her only grandchild, but he's being \"taken away\" from her because her DIL got a job in NYC. She always has suspected and hated a certain man in town who she THINKS killed her daughter - I'd bet you $500 he didn't really do it.You know? It's the kind of book where at the end everyone cries, hugs and learns a big Lesson About Life, but at the same time it's really sad - humans are so fucked up, blah blah blah.It's just the kind of thing that sets my teeth on edge.I might not finish it. Or come back to it later. At least the crappy romances I've been reading are cheerful! :) LOL I know, everyone thinks it is great. I don't know what's wrong with me. I really hate boo-hoo stories though, and I feel like this is a boo-hoo story. I don't like books whose basic message is \"Life is so tragic, but we must keep living!\" or something. Also, no one was really likable. P.S. And none of this is too spoilery, just first-three-chapters stuff."}, {"userName": "Amy", "userReviewDate": "Oct 07, 2013", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/5267822-amy", "userReview": "***Contains Spoilers***Eh. I doubt I would've finished this if it wasn't a book club selection. I just didn't care about any of the characters or how the story was going to end.It's definitely not going into the stack of books I consider to be riveting. ;-) I'd throw it in the stack of stories about selfish people making selfish choices in life. I don't agree with any of the choices made by the characters. I don't think real people would make the decisions these characters made. I find it hard to believe that forgiveness could be given so quickly in some of the instances in the story. I mean, come on, someone does something that drastically changes your life completely in a negative way...you're not going to forgive them within a few days or 50 pages at the end of a book. Someone murders your child & you sit around angry for 20+ years...you find out who...you're not going to sit around thinking about what you should do. I'm pretty sure you'll decide 1 of 2 things: either you're going to murder that person or you're going to tell the police. You find out that your husband murdered someone when he was 17? You don't stay with him or keep his secret for the sake of your children. You leave that psycho & turn him in to the police. Especially if the only reason he can come up with for murdering the person is \"She laughed at me & I got angry.\" Really? You're going to take your chances with that kind of person in your life. Really? Anytime he did something stupid & you wanted to laugh...you'd have that voice in the back of your head saying \"Don't laugh. Remember what happened to that one girl that laughed at him?\" Your best friend who is also your cousin steals your husband? You're not going to forgive her or your husband within a week. You just don't allow people like that to remain in your life. So what if she was your one & only friend? You go find better friends. So what if your kid is going to be sad if you get a divorce? You don't sacrifice your self respect so that your kid can grow up in a home with married parents. I mean, seriously...if your husband thinks it's a fantastic idea for him to move his new love into your home so you can be one big happy family...you run for the hills or suggest that he move to a compound where it's acceptable to have multiple wives. Sure, it starts with him just moving her in...next thing you know...you have the hair style & fashion sense of Nikki from Big Love. You don't forgive him a week later when he claims that he made a mistake & really loves you...not your best friend/cousin. If he really loved you, he never would've suggested that you move into the guest bedroom while your best friend/cousin takes your place in the master bedroom. \"Normal\" people don't suggest that you let the other woman move in & play house with you. Basically...it's a story full of selfish people making selfish decisions while pretending to care about the people they hurt while making selfish decisions. The only decision I agreed with that these characters made was to eat hot cross buns for breakfast...and only because they were drenched in butter...and damn...I love butter."}, {"userName": "Mary Clarke", "userReviewDate": "Sep 27, 2013", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/19986330-mary-clarke", "userReview": "I have not read any other Liane Moriarty books and am not inclined to after reading this one.

At first she doesn't think too much of it but her husband, John-Paul, begins to behave weirdly when she mentions the letter and suddenly she can't stop thinking what the letter is about. Rachel lives in the same neighborhood as Cecilia and has been mourning the death of her daughter Janie for years.

I know a lot of people really enjoyed this book but I just couldn't get into it. I did like the authors writing style but I just felt like the story didn't come together. The passages about the past around when the Berlin wall fell felt like they didn't add anything to the story for me personally. Also Tess's story didn't tie in together with Cecilia and Rachel's stories which kind only bothered me because how well Cecilia and Rachel's stories went together. It just felt like the whole Tess story line could have been cut out of the book without any problems. It was all just really predictable, the second I read Rachel's chapter I knew where everything was going. Also that ending made me think of Jodi Picoult and her little twist endings and not in a good way. It just felt too coincidental for me to buy.

In one ear and out the other. The story is about a woman who discovers a letter addressed to her from her husband in a box in the attic. It says only to open it in the case of his death. Her husband is not dead yet and so she agonizes through too many chapters about whether to open the letter. The reader knows the contents of the letter will be pretty exciting because Moriarty starts a foreword with a passage about Pandora\u2019s box. So we get dragged along by suspense and then\u2026well, I won\u2019t spoil it. The book is actually about three separate women and their immediate families which confused me when the point of view abruptly switched between chapters from Pandora Letter Woman to someone else. PET PEEVE ALERT: Hate when writers do this. Just because they\u2019ve spent X number of years with these characters and are intimately familiar with them doesn\u2019t mean the readers are. Also, it takes an exceptionally good writer to effortlessly transition between characters or introduce new characters without some sort of clue to the reader (such as heading each chapter with a name, etc.). The book, for all its seriousness, actually feels a little trite and silly. The plot feels made for TV or for a movie or whatever (have the book rights been sold?). Anyway, I\u2019d say that I was pretty emotionally disconnected from the characters and their individual plights throughout the book, only continuing to read because it was entertaining and fast-paced.

He\u2019s home now and he\u2019s recovering very well. Why I had to share this is because during the days I didn\u2019t know what to do, the magic of reading once again worked its miracles on me. This particular book kept me distracted from thinking too much or crying too much and perhaps for that alone, this book will always have a special place in my heart.The Husband\u2019s Secret certainly is literally hard to put down and when I\u2019m not reading it, I often find myself thinking about what\u2019s going to happen next. I felt completely drawn to the three women in the story and I find myself invested and involved in each of their lives, rooting for them and for their well-being even though they are not exactly the epitome of excellent character. In fact, they\u2019re admittedly flawed and yet the author managed to make me look at their lives as if I was the one living theirs because they are all completely fleshed-out and I could just feel their every emotion. It was so easy to feel connected with these characters especially with the good sprinkling of relatable and witty humor the author always injected in their thoughts. Even more impressive is how the author was able to make me question my own morality. I bet just like me, a lot of people could confidently say that they are moral human beings who know what is right from what is wrong but the predicament of these characters constantly made me think, \u201cif I were in their shoes, I probably would have done the same thing or perhaps, even worse.\u201d Even if it bothered my conscience, I would have also fixated on my own and my loved ones\u2019 preservation. I both admire and hate Ms. Liane Moriarty for doing this to me. Such a talented storyteller, that woman. (Yeah, we\u2019re close. ^_^)The inter-relatedness of the lives of the three women messed up with my emotions because the preservation of one means sacrificing the other and heck, I could not think of a way to put a solution to what they\u2019re going through. I was just hoping for a miracle or a twist of fate to strike them and instantly put an end to all their misery. Fortunately and unfortunately, my wish was granted. Everything fell into pieces although it\u2019s quite sad and a bit tragic, this is exactly where the popular saying, \u201ceverything happens for a reason\u201d applies. Indeed, some secrets need to remain secrets. The book save for the epilogue that quite detached me from the characters and the preceding events is a solid four star read. This was my first book by Ms. Moriarty, but I think I have a new go-to author when I\u2019m looking for something mysterious, quite angsty but twisty and thought provoking fiction to read."}, {"userName": "Linda", "userReviewDate": "Feb 16, 2017", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/41464918-linda", "userReview": "\"The Husband's Secret\" is a prime example of why I pay attention to book covers. As I walked into the bookstore, this first edition book with a pearlescent background; embossed black title; and a shattered pink rose immediately drew me to it--beautiful and on sale, too!I was familiar with the author's name, but I'd never read any of her books. My expectations were not high, but I definitely needed a change of pace from the previous four books I'd read. This one turned out to be the perfect book at the perfect time; but more likely, it would have been the perfect book at any time.What an interesting storyline. I was hooked from the beginning. I found myself sympathetic towards every character, no matter what their circumstances were. The surprises were many, and I enjoyed the touch of humor sprinkled about the chapters, even though this was a serious, fast-paced read. The entire book was a lesson on understanding and forgiveness.

I was impressed by the way the author handled this, although I must admit, in the beginning, for the first few chapters, I was a bit confused about what was happening and where it was leading. There are a lot of secondary characters introduced in the first chapter, and they were a bit hard for me to sort out. Once this novel really got moving for me,(along about chapter three) this became a book that I didn't relish having to put down. I loved the quirky characters and the way the story expands into other areas and then folds back into itself, creating bonds among the various story lines. This is not a book that I would recommend reading whilst you are distracted. This story deserves your full and undivided attention for it to truly be appreciated as it should. This is the type of book that I would take with me on a vacation or for a lazy weekend and read when there are few other commitments. For being such a complex and unique story, it was still a relatively easy read to finish in a short time. As the tale grows, it becomes more an more interesting and captivating, leaving you desperate to know what happens in the end. The ending was not only appropriate, but handled so well that it felt like a real reward once I got there. Overall, this was impressive and a book that I would certainly recommend to others.

In my humble opinion, of course.Why? Because it was like nothing I\u2019ve ever read. With a clever plot, \u2018real\u2019 and relatable characters and engaging writing, this novel was amazingly done. It was very different from what I usually read, but from time to time I love to read something like this.. From the title you can guess the story is about a secret\u2026obviously, but this novel is about more than that. It\u2019s a story about life, families, community, relationship between family\u2019s members, lies and more. Also from the title you think this novel is a mystery. And it has some kind of mystery here and there, but I can\u2019t label it as a mystery. It\u2019s simply fiction with mystery/suspenseful/romance elements. I\u2019m not gonna lie, the story was predictable at times, but I think most of fiction novels are in one way or another. It\u2019s not a \u2018real\u2019 mystery, so I wasn\u2019t bothered at all by this aspect. The story is very well done and it\u2019s gripping from the very first page. It\u2019s original, smart and seriously I couldn\u2019t put it down. Even after the big reveal, the story was interesting. Needless to say the story was addictive from the beginning to end.\u201cThe Husband\u2019s Secret\u201d is a story that centers around three women \u2013 Cecilia, Tess and Rachel. Cecilia \u2013 is 42 years old woman who apparently has it all: a good, hardworking, loving and faithful husband, three beautiful healthy daughters and a satisfying job she loves. She finds a letter written by her husband to be opened after his dead, but he\u2019s still alive. She has to know what the letter is about. What she didn\u2019t expected it is her husband\u2019s letter to change not only her life, but other people's lives as well.Tess \u2013 is in her mid-thirties. She\u2019s a wife and a mother. She thinks her marriage is solid, but she will found out everything is not always what it seems when her husband and her cousin confess they fell for each other. She feels betrayed, she\u2019s angry and all she wants is to escape.Rachel \u2013 is a 68 years old woman who can\u2019t move on from the murder of her daughter more than two decades ago. She\u2019s angry, bitter and she would give everything she has to find out who\u2019s the one who kill her baby girl. These three woman know each other, but not very well. Apparently there\u2019s no connection between them, but they are more connected than they think.I really liked these three women and I loved how realistically they are portrayed. They have flaws, fears, insecurities, dreams. They felt real. I really sympathize with all three of them. I enjoyed all their povs and I enjoyed how their \u2018voices\u2019 are so different from each other, how honest and real are. I have to admit at some point each one for these woman annoyed the hell out of me. Yeah, at times they were really frustrating. This aspect didn\u2019t affect my rating, because well, it\u2019s fiction and in some way I understood why they act how they act, why they feel how they feel and so on.. and of course because each one of us is different. I loved being in their heads and I really felt I know these women. I really enjoyed the ending. I\u2019m sure some readers will consider it a little abrupt, but IMO it\u2019s \u2018the perfect\u2019 ending for this kind of novel. Honestly when I saw there\u2019s an epilogue I was kind of surprised, because liked I said the ending worked very well for me. Well...the epilogue is the shit. Really!! I can\u2019t remember the last time I enjoyed an epilogue as much as I enjoyed this one. It was pure and simple clever and like the book itself unique. The epilogue and actually the entire book will make you think, reflect, wonder about...many things. This book is about secrets, lies, about what ifs, about how every decision has consequences.

Or, I was hooked into the idea of it. I was just so curious and I really just wanted to know WHAT was in that damn letter!!!! I wasn't even planning to read this book now even though I had it on my eventual TBR so I started it thinking that maybe I'd just find out the secret and stop there... But the story sucked me in and I just kept reading and reading and reading and it became my impromptu next read almost against my will just because I literally could not put it down.This book is totally different than \"our\" usual books - not a romance book even though there are romantic elements. I'd really just call it straight-up fiction. And even though my heart lies with the romance genre, I have to admit that this was a\u00a0very well done book.I won't say too much about the plot but it's a very complex story that starts off with three main story lines following the lives of three women:- a woman who discovered a life-changing secret- a woman who was betrayed by her husband- a woman whose past had been stolen and whose future had suddenly been derailedWhat none of them know is that they are all connected.\n\n\"There are so many secrets about our lives we'll never know\u2026\"\n\nThe way all the story lines of this book came together was so clever, so brilliant and honestly even though the style isn't the kind I usually read, I loved the writing. It was interesting because in some ways, it seemed to go in ten different directions at once while still always moving forward and slowly (but very surely) weaving these different story lines together.It was a very insightful story that got you right into the minds of these women. It was a wonderfully honest and introspective look into different people's views and perspectives. It was almost painfully real though -- a candid look at the truths behind all kinds of relationships (not just romantic ones). These women were all so different and yet I could find myself sympathizing with each one in one way or another.As the story went on, you began to see the connections more and more. It was kind of like seeing something out of the corner of your eye. You know it's there but when you try and look right at it, it vanishes.Ok, I will however admit that by the time I got to reading the letter, I had already guessed it's content and at that point, I was kind of wondering if I should keep reading or not (again, remember that at this point, I wasn't even planning to review it) but the good writing and my darn curiosity kept me going and I'm so glad I did because some of those later reveals were huge and I began to realize that the content of the letter was just the tip of the iceberg and the real meat of the story was the consequences of those facts and the deeper connections between the characters.Now, about the ending -- \u00a0Even though the story was fully wrapped up, it left me feeling... unsettled? See, this is why I love romance, I love that fully wrapped-up feeling that the genre nearly always delivers. Rarely (in a standalone) are we ever left with uncertainties... and while this book does answer all the questions in the end, it still left me just... unsettled. However, it also ended at the perfect place for this story. There was no more story to tell and everything that needed to be said was said.This book is not fluffy, nor is it disturbing... it's not a light read, nor a dark one. It just told a candid, very honest view of a situation that wove many lives together in a way no one would have expected and to an extent that perhaps no one will ever fully know. I guess it makes you wonder what else in your life in connected to something else. No matter how much you think about it, you'll never\u00a0really\u00a0know but sometimes... it's interesting to wonder.In terms of story telling and fabrication, this book was top notch. In terms of involving me in the story, keeping my attention, and keeping me guessing, again this book delivered so strongly. It was a total departure from my usual kind of read. It was fiction, not romance, and while I really really enjoyed it, I'm happy to go back to my romance books now. It was a great reading experience though and it was really fun to step outside my box. If you're looking for something totally different (and I mean\u00a0totally different) I'd absolutely recommend giving this book a try!Rating:\u00a04 stars for the way it left me feeling, but 5 stars for the storytelling.**************************** For more of my reviews, book news and updates:\u2726 Main blog: Aestas Book Blog\u2726 Facebook Blog Page\u2726 Twitter"}, {"userName": "Heather K (dentist in my spare time)", "userReviewDate": "Mar 24, 2015", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/13070326-heather-k-dentist-in-my-spare-time", "userReview": "Not bad, as far as my local book club choices go.

I'd like to think this is a story of ordinary people going through extraordinary circumstances. Rather, it's simply a story of ordinary people going through ordinary circumstances. First thing's first - Liane Moriarty is a terrific writer, a gifted storyteller. She wove together a story here that essentially spoke about ordinary, every day events, but made it into a page-turning thriller of a read. That's not an easy feat. All the characters involved were interesting. They were three dimensional real people, and as a reader, I became quite invested in their lives. Moriarty also got the mood of each scenario right. Without spoiling too much, I think Moriarty particularly got Tess's situation perfectly. She captured the embarrassment, bitterness, irrationality and rationality, confusion, anger, that accompanies such a betrayal. I was right there with Tess for the ride. I was concerned when, half-way through the novel, The Husband's Secret is actually revealed. I thought, 'Well what the hell happens now? There's still 200 pages left...' The answer: a lot more happens. The characters' lives continue to unravel, we learn more about their pasts, and yet another tragedy occurs. The latter tragedy was unexpected. I expected something else to happen, and then I was thrown a curve ball. In hindsight, I should have seen it coming - all the markers were right there in front of me. (Read, and you shall see what I'm talking about.)In all, this was the definition of a character driven novel. Everything that happens in this novel, happens all over the world every single day. It's a testament to the skill of Moriarty for having kept the reader engaged. One thing I didn't like was the last chapter and the epilogue. I felt as though their issues were too easily resolved, wrapped up, and tucked away to potentially be forgotten about. I think perhaps Moriarty wanted to showcase the awesome power of forgiveness in humans. And she'd be right in that, which is why this is easy enough to overlook. But I'm personally doubtful it would have happened that way for every person in this story. I'd have liked to see a couple of the issues remain unresolved, because happy endings don't always happen. Further, I think the epilogue could have been omitted altogether. It sort of felt that Moriarty couldn't even, herself, let go of the story and needed to tie up any loose ends that might've been left dangling. Sometimes there need to be questions left unanswered at the end of a story, and I wish there would've more of that here. I think, with the epilogue, Moriarty was going for one last 'shock-factor' moment. She really didn't need it.In all, helluva read. I can certainly see why reading groups and book clubs have been drooling over this one. There's a bunch of symbolism in those pages to be unraveled and discussed.

I only read about 25 pages and it bored me to tears. A wife is sitting with a letter on her lap, undecided if she should opened it or not. For the life of me I couldn't understand why she was being so apprehensive to open it. It's just a goddamn letter. Apparently she had this nagging gut feeling that there is something huge in it, maybe a secret, something that will change her life forever. But the way author went about it, made me want to bang my head agains the wall in frustration. Our female MC is a f*cking procrastinator on steroids.

This girlfriend would probably say this, another would most likely say this, the third... Shoot me please.Then she remembers some boy, who's death was or wasn't important.
