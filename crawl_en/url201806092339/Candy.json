Candy's depiction of a very horny 50s america is also a depiction of the various obsessions and bugaboos of that time period, and in that way it is somewhat interesting. thematically. somewhat.it is a picaresque and fast-paced tale, and the similarities between the title name and candide are obvious. sadly, its many attacks on the staid ole 50s come across as tired and cliched. there is also, as always, something deeply problematic in the use of a naive sexpot as a symbol of liberation. i mean seriously, is this cliche jackoff persona really such a timeless icon that she has to be used so consistently throughout literature? i prefer her where she belongs, amidst the entirely unrealistic and two-dimensional caricatures of porn. there are surely more interesting personifications of empowerment, particularly female empowerment, to be drawn upon. and the various sexy scenarios were actually not very hot at all.still, the novel is not without its worth, as a relic of its time."}, {"userName": "Chris", "userReviewDate": "Apr 17, 2009", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/733629-chris", "userReview": "Few are the books which deliver on all possible levels and to all possible audiences, and Candy reigns supreme as their undisputed queen. There are those who might disagree with me, but there are also folk that don't believe dinosaurs existed since they aren't mentioned in the Bible. So don't be a hater; get up off your Candy(less)-ass, drum up a plan to finagle a copy of this book, and jump on the bandwagon of the winning team.\tI have absolutely no doubts that my persuasive intro convinced you that to ignore the greatness of Candy would be the height of folly, but before you embark on a mission which risks life and limb tracking down this masterpiece, let me give you a little taste of the creamy goodness to come... just a little sample which will leave you writhing on the floor, begging to digest the story whole.\tI came across this awesome work while kicking it in my old hood, at a resale shop I used to love going to and sadly now live about 45 minutes from. Paperbacks are usually 50 cents there, but on this fateful visit, there was a small collection of \u2018vintage\u2019 books in a glass case ranging from $2 to $15 bucks. Naturally I was intrigued, and on first glance, I had some explanation as to why they were under lock and key, the selection was almost universally smutty in nature. Regardless, I risked looking like a pervert and asked to take a gander at these treasures, and solidified my perverted nature by purchasing a trio of them; I couldn\u2019t help myself, all three presented themselves as completely tawdry smut, catering solely to purely prurient interests, basically, the sole reasons I continue to read.\tI\u2019ve got to make a quick sidenote here, within this sidenote, regarding the store I was purchasing this filth at. This particular resale shop allegedly supports/funds a battered women\u2019s shelter, I assume the proceeds go directly towards castrating or shackling the former tormentors of the victims. However, with the number of studies (not that I\u2019ve seen them, but often brought up by anti-porn pundits in debates) that show the sexual objectification of women as a gateway to battery and/or rape at the hands of the uncontrollable, drooling troglodytes which make up the male sex, I am somewhat perplexed as to how they justify selling this stuff. Turning a profit (or receiving a donation) from books which degrade women such as Candy seemingly goes against their principles, and thus supports my oft-mocked theory this place is actually a front for either a Nicaraguan drug ring or assists in exporting young white girls as slaves to Mozambique. Either that or it goes to show that there is no room for business ethics when a buck can be made in a cutthroat capitalist economy.\tAnyway, let me explain to you just how seedy this book was, by providing sample text from the front and back covers (all I dared to inspect under the watchful eye of the slightly-frightened lady accommodating my perusal); the cover alone promised I was holding \u201cthe world\u2019s most talked about book\u201d, and the back had an excerpt from the story which contained this brilliance \u201dBut, oh Daddy, when Uncle Jack looked at me that way, and when he beseeched me to give him all my true warmth on the hospital floor, his need was so great, so so \u2013aching- of course I gave to him\u201d The fact I enthusiastically purchased this gives you some sickening insight to my soul. The fact I also escalated it to the next book in my queue probably doesn\u2019t put me in any better light.\tA few pages in, I thought I knew exactly what was going on in the book, that this was just some hastily-scribbled smut working the Daddy\u2019s Worst Nightmare scenario; the protagonist, Candy Christian, is Daddy\u2019s Little Girl, and also a mindless, burgeoning skank under the tutelage of erudite, bohemian hep-cat Professor Mephesto. I\u2019m sure the average D.W.N. is pretty universal: walking in to find your daughter coated in layers of jit while your poker buddies are slapping her face with recently-spent (and enormous) tallywhackers and wiping the residual joy-juice from their monstrous schlongs off with your golf club warmers. Luckily for those of us reading Candy for a good laugh, \u201cDaddy\u201d Christian is a little more imaginative than all that. After catching Candy preparing to fellate the totally stereotypical and monosyllabic Mexican gardener, Emmanuel, his thoughts are revealed: \u201cIt was not as though he couldn\u2019t believe his eyes, for it was a scene that had formed a part of many of his most lively and hideous dreams - dreams which began with Candy be ravished, first by Mephesto, then by foreigners, then by negroes, then gorillas, then bulldogs, then donkeys, horses, mules, kangaroos, elephants, rhinos, and finally, in the grand finale, by all of them at once, grouped around different parts of her, though it was Candy who was the aggressor, she who was voraciously ravishing them, frantically forcing the bunched and spurting organs into every orifice, vagina, anus, mouth, ears, nose\u2026.he had even dreamed once that she asked him if it were true that there was a small uncovered opening in the pupil of the eye, because if it were she would have room there for a praying mantis.\u201d Daddy is our type of man; utterly and completely fucking ridiculous!! However, right after his kangaroo/praying mantis gangbang recollection, he attacks the gardener, but his shabby, middle-class, white-boy fighting skills are trumped by Emmanuel\u2019s inherently-Mexican trowel-wielding prowess, and he\u2019s lobotomized! Don\u2019t worry, Daddy\u2019s quickly and quite conveniently replaced by his identical twin brother, and his drunken nymphomaniac wife, Livia.\tIt was at this point in the novel that I made a startling discovery; this book wasn\u2019t just smut, this book was actually a parody of Voltaire\u2019s Candide, a classic which I happen to be quite fond of. I have to admit, this actually did shock the shit out of me. In retrospect, there were a few clues which I overlooked, the first being the title page pronouncing the book as \u201cMaxwell Kenton\u2019s Satirical Novel\u201d, and a quote from Candide kicking off the first chapter (which I honestly just figured was tossed in to give it some element of respectability to prevent it from being banned), and lastly, the similar-sounding names, Candy and Candide. Very fucking clever Maxwell, you wily rapscallion. Now, able to see my man Professor Mephesto as a modern-day Pangloss, causing untold damage to a na\u00efve student with his philosophy consisting of balderdash and malarkey, I was able to continue reading with renewed pleasure. Sure, the fact that I didn\u2019t immediately catch that this was a perverse retelling of Candide after the first page was somewhat embarrassing, but I caught on by page 30, illustrating how much smarter this book made me in such short time!\tWith my Daddy\u2019s Worst Nightmare theory sadly thrown to the wind, the book continues as a tongue in cheek parody of Candide, except instead of arguing the idea that we live in the \u2018best of all possible worlds\u2019 by entangling the narrator in all sorts of life-threatening misfortunes, here we see the argument against free love being the \u2018best of all possible privileges\u2019 by getting Candy worked-over in increasingly insane sexual imbroglios. These events include anal action with the nose of a Buddha statue, incest, and of course, the depraved zenith of the book, Candy\u2019s mind-blowing copulation with a bedraggled, wino hunchback, which climaxes with Candy demanding that he attempt forcing his unwashed and deformed hump into her succulent lamb-pit. \tI\u2019m proud to prematurely announce Candy as the winner of my 2009 \u201cHoly Shit\u201d Award, certain nothing in the next few months will come close to challenging its twisted magnificence."}, {"userName": "Nikki", "userReviewDate": "Jan 10, 2008", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/423371-nikki", "userReview": "I read this book a few times the summer between the 6th and 7th grades.Candy taught me to refer to grown-up lady-parts as honey pots and spice boxes.I wish I had known at the time that this was supposed to be satire."}, {"userName": "Ben", "userReviewDate": "May 19, 2012", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/7549478-ben", "userReview": "One of my all-time favorite films is Barbarella, and that's where I first encountered Terry Southern's name, as one of its screenwriters. Now, while I was reading Candy I couldn't help but notice remarkable similarities: Candy Christian behaves more like a battery-operated talking fuckdoll than a human being, just like... Barbarella. Candy is comprised of a series of disconnected events (calling it a \"plot\" is something I have a lot of reservations about.) just like Barbarella... however Candy is no Jane Fonda, and without the movie's campy but exotic studio sets, costumes, sci-fi props, Candy is far less fun.I liked male characters somewhat better. They are not typical hunky, muscular studs we almost always read in erotica these days. Especially the Hunchback is quite memorable...:The shop on this corner of Grove was a man's underwear shop, and the hunchback's eyes devoured another crotch or two before he looked up. He was also smiling. He supposed she was a policewoman. \"Rubatubdub!\" he said, agitating his hump vigorously against the tree. Getting run in was part of his kick.\"Three men in a tub!\" cried Candy, laughing in marvel at their immediate rapport. How simple! she thought.And this passage:The hunchback was lying naked, curled on his side like a big foetus, when Candy appeared before him, standing for a moment in full lush radiance, a naked angel bearing the supreme gift. Then, she got into bed quickly, under the sheet, almost soundlessly, saying, \"Darling, darling,\" and cuddling him to her at once, while he, his head with the most freakish thoughts imaginable--all about tubs of living and broken toys, every manner of excrement, scorpions, steelwool, pig-masks, odd metal harness, etc.--tried desperately to pry into the images a single reminder: the money!Mmmmmm.Addendum: Ok, I am reading Trippin' with Terry Southern: What I Think I Remember and, according to the author, Southern clearly had Candy in mind when writing Barbarella: \"Overall Terry loved writing Barbarella because he felt it was his Candy--a brave girl trying to do the right thing but in outer space.\""}, {"userName": "Evan", "userReviewDate": "Apr 22, 2009", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/1248986-evan", "userReview": "Acquired via interlibrary loan. Salacious comical odyssey of a young girl's carnal initiation. Written in 1958. This will be my entre into the world of Terry Southern (apart from films). If it's really good, I'll tackle \"The Magic Christian\" or \"Blue Movie\" next.UPDATE:Blazed through the first 73 pages on the bus and would have continued if not for pending family business. I actually laughed aloud on the bus when I came to this, spouted by the lascivious Aunt Liv: \"I'm in the mood for cock and plenty of it! About ten pounds, thick and fast!\"So this is pretty fucking funny so far, written with confidence and it flows like the smoothest buttah. There's slapstick and satire and a certain hapless charm as Candy tries to lose her virginity. I'm not sure this is really a great book, but it's just plain fun -- and there's something to be said for that.HALFWAY or so:OK, well the antics in the hospital and then the hunchback thing, hmmm... Methinks the book is falling apart a bit after the terrific flowing momentum of its first third. It reads well, though. And there are laughs and imagination. Surprisingly, the book is not as dirty as a lot of people seem to be suggesting. When it is dirty, it is quite so, but it just isn't nasty very often. It's hard to think of anyone getting off to this book; it's mainly a comedy. Candy herself is a relatively poorly defined character, it seems to me. One minute she's supposed to be kind of dumb and naive, and other times she seems to possess smarts at odds with the cluelessness. It's hard for the reader to think of her as an erotic object/being, despite her appearance as one to the other characters.FINAL:Scattershot, but admirably transgressive."}, {"userName": "Kandice", "userReviewDate": "Feb 13, 2016", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/1396160-kandice", "userReview": "This was awful.

I guess, but the way in which Candy is painted as a such an innocent slut (talk about an oxymoron!) is offensive. 2/14 - I've been reading other reviews and feel I should add a note. Another \"gentleman\" said that the ridiculous situations Candy finds herself in, i.e. a full gynecological exam in a public restroom, a Buddha statue's nose shoved up her ass as a penis fills her front, are all situations that men, being the oversexed beings they are, truly believe could happen.

Wright Mills anymore. They were reading putatively less worthy stuff like Jeremy Larner's Drive, He Said and Thomas Pynchon's V and Candy by Terry Southern and Mason Hoffenberg. This seems in many ways like an artifact of its time. It's couched as a satire, although the subject of the satire if a bit hard to parse. Candy, the main character, is a somewhat vacant young college woman, who writes on a philosophy paper that the greatest love is to give oneself away completely. She proceeds through a, I suppose, sexual farce, finding herself in a series of compromising situations, most of which we would call rape, and if they didn't call it rape, they should have. It seems to reveal two things as possible satiric objects: one pretty tired, the other somewhat more interesting. If, the target is the tendency toward an tepid search for enlightenment through self-abnegation, in Candy, as pretty young white girl, you have a typical target for male chauvinism of the left. To a kind of well-heeled political cynicism/realism, a naive young woman is the perfect emblem of a naive, idealistic culture. Candy seems to be the projection of a sort of stuffy, male pseudo-sophisticate. She searches for spiritual awakening by giving her body away. She's not sexual liberated; she's sexually \u2013 I dunno \u2013 castrated. It's not about her enjoyment at all. If you role all that into a ball you get the failure of sexual liberation in recapitulated macho bullshit. Whether that's intentional or not, I don't know. The implication I feel like I'm supposed to get is that all of this is a lot of fun. Not so much.If on the other hand, the target is men themselves, the premise of the novel is that whatever one's stated intentions might be everyone wants to have sex with Candy. Beneath any pretense of politics, education, spirituality, if it's a man, he is after one thing. There is something to the idea, but \"the romp\" seems ill-suited to it. Despite the datedness of the sexpolitics there are still some moments of genuine humor: the way Hoffenberg and Southern peer into the greatest fear of Candy's dad \u2013 Mr. Christian \u2013 is wicked, and skewers the target who actually deserves it on his own culturally cretinous point."}, {"userName": "Elf M.", "userReviewDate": "Oct 30, 2011", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/6826433-elf-m", "userReview": "Candy by \"Maxwell Canton\" (a psuedonym for Terry Southern and Mason Hoffenberg) is a 1958 novel that is apparently fondly remembered by lots of its fans for its breathless descriptions of an excessively naive, manipulable and attractive young lady as she careens through one bizarre encounter after another while a rolling cast of late-50s stereotypical characters attempts to seduce her: her teacher Professor Mephesto, her Uncle Jack and his wife Livia (who apparently also swings wildly between cocaine-fueled cockwhore and sullen brat), the peculiar Dr. Krankeit and the desperate Dr. Duncan, and thereafter by equally creepy physicians, doctors, police officers, cult leaders, Communists, religious gurus, and finally The Buddha himself. Very few of these men (and sadly, never Livia) ever get into her pants; those that do tend to have less-than-succesful moments. The book is replete with descriptions of her lush nakedness and cute euphemisms for various body parts.The book is really a succession of farcical set-pieces about pretentious teachers, \"liberated\" women, the weird \"sexology\" of the late 1950's, the rise of strange religious cults (although why they take a swipe at the Quakers I can't tell), the relationships between cops and gay bars at the time. There's an almost painfully extended piece about Jews and the way they did or did not integrate well with the larger American community at the time. (I write \"painfully\" because there were a lot of men from my family and their extended communities who bore the scars of those battles. One of my relatives in the early 1970s delighted his mother by becoming a law professor-- \"A doctor and a lawyer!\"-- a career which he almost immediately abandoned to write porn. Sadly, I'm not actually related to him and my parents adamantly refused to tell me his pen name.)I found the book a bit disappointing. I can see how it was a thrill to read in 1960. I can see how the authors thought it was subversive and funny. But one of the things I've learned in the past forty years is that we don't really run to a reductio world when we have one of these bizarre societal adolescent moments; instead, we outgrow them, establish a new equilibrium, and move on. It was a \"smile, yeah, that was probably amusing once\" kind of book."}, {"userName": "Bill", "userReviewDate": "Nov 15, 2016", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/39900517-bill", "userReview": "Published in 1958, Candy is dirty enough that even now many readers will snort \u201cFilth!\u201d and throw it in a trashcan.

This book is the rawest experience with sexual explicitness, I believe, one could possibly read. If one would guess which book of all books might have been banned, one would guess this one (and of course it was).Yet the implausible scenes it gives us, strangely, to the average man, are weirdly plausible. That is why this fiction works: I know it might strike some if not most people as strange, but I truly believe that if you think about it the average man would not think it at all unreasonable that a full gynecological exam would occur in the rest room of a Greenwich Village bar, as it does in this book, or that in every single scene in which a man appears with Candy no matter what the profession of the man, whether professor, doctor, mystic or whomever, sex is the ulterior motive of all their interactions.Candy is presented as an innocent, the original bleeding heart liberal, whose love and compassion for a hunchback on Grove Street, for example, is heartwarming but at the same time ridiculous because the guy's certifiably nuts but because of her broad loving arms and open-mindedness she cannot perceive even his inability to speak coherent English. Later, in bed, when he starts beating her with a hangar, she transforms the scene into a \"just punishment\" for the sins of all mankind towards the unfortunate deformed.Terry Southern's extraordinary clever and creative, funny as hell, yet as I said there's a deep moral tale hidden behind the, well, perfect behind, often exposed in telling detail, of the heroine of this book, Miss Candy Christian."}, {"userName": "Jose Moch", "userReviewDate": "May 09, 2013", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/5725118-jose-moch", "userReview": "I didn't find the novel as hilarious as I thought it would be. What I like of it is the notion of a girl well cultivated in literature and art cinema although really dumb in everything else. It is common to find such girls in college. What I found funny though was the lingo of aunt Livia, interesting the musing of the kike doctor while facing racial slurs by Dr. Dunlap and his castrating mother that no wonder prompted him to write a book about jerking off. In the same vein is the one of the hunchback when confronted with Candy's sexual overtures. The last two chapters with guru Grindle are obviously the best in the book and I realized that many chapters were unnecessary for the novel's finale.Terry Southern's \"Candy\" is a descent of Alice in Wondersex that proves the authors best intentions while overtaking such a literary venture.As for myself, I've gone through all six stages of spiritual advancement and just need to meet an adorable Candy to initiate in the mystical path."}, {"userName": "Booklovinglady", "userReviewDate": "Aug 04, 2016", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/5986596-booklovinglady", "userReview": "Candy is incredibly funny :-) Hilariously so even, at times.

The scene at the hospital is hilarious, and also the episodes with the Mexican gardener and Grindle are very funny. Not to mention the end ;-)At the back of my edition, a number of quotes are given, one of them (by Herbert Gold) saying \"Good grief, it's a very funny book\" and another (by Irwin Shaw) saying \"Absolutely hilarious\".
