You've got some zombies, a poltergeist and an impish carnivorous spirit.To the positive, the author covers a wide range of villains and portrays them very well. The book is solidly written and the stories move along at an extremely rapid pace.To the negative, the whole thing lacks depth. Considering the reading time the price on Amazon is outrageously high. These are less stories than the are very small vignettes into particularly gruesome situations. It's as if they were dashed off in a day and sent to publication. They're so short that there's no time for any real tension to build for the reader.In summary, there's potential for this author but this particular collection seems a bit small to be sold on its own."}, {"userName": "Nancy Silk", "userReviewDate": "Oct 06, 2016", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/7140636-nancy-silk", "userReview": "\"Boo!
