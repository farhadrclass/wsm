A combination of folklore, ghost story and a real murder trial, set at the turn of the century in Appalachia. This author does these types of stories so well, and always does an amazing amount of research. Dark in tone, rich in atmosphere, a strong character in Mary Jane, a mother who would do anything to see that her daughter received justice, at a time when woman had little power. Inside an asylum for the colored, sits a man, a lawyer, now in his sixties who tried to do away with himself. A young doctor, half his age starts talking to him as a new therapy, and it is during these sessions that the tale unfolds. A strange one it is indeed. The amazing thing is that so much of this is true, real people that lived in the past, actual testimony taken from the trial. Of course, filler is added and this is where the story stalled form a bit, the lawyers backgrounds, the patient and the lead lawyer, who has a very storied past were all disclosed in some length. These parts were for me, very slow reading. Still, the tale as a whole has much to recommend it, and it made for a great October read. I did love the touches she added at books end, added greatly to what had come before.

The book was extremely well researched.The book flips back and forth between two time frames. The first is Greenbrier, West Virginia and 1897, where young Zona Heaster marries a man nicknamed \u201cTrout\u201d, whom she hardly knows and suffers dire consequences. Her mother Mary Jane is a strong willed woman who will stop at nothing to get justice for her daughter. The second is Lakin, West Virginia and 1930, where an attorney named James Gardner finds himself in an insane asylum under the care of a doctor nicknamed \u201cBoozer\u201d who wants to help him and he must tell his story to prove his sanity in order to get out. As it turns out, Gardner\u2019s story converges with Ms. Zona\u2019s as he helped defend the man on trial for the murder of his young bride decades earlier.Both of those stories are unique, interesting and they hold your attention. Further, Mary Jane\u2019s character stood out and really made the story.However, the back stories of the all of the peripheral characters contained a lot of extraneous details that were superfluous and unnecessary to the story itself and unfortunately made the novel drag quite a bit and almost made me give up on it. That being said, the author\u2019s note added a lot to the novel as it was clear how much work the author put into the book. Had it not been for Mary Jane\u2019s character, I would have given the book 2 Stars but she warranted another \u00bd star. In addition, it was the author\u2019s note that made me raise the rating on the book there after from 2.5 to 3 Stars.

We all really enjoyed the Appalachian ghost story with the turn of the century real murder case and appreciated all the research put into this story explained by Sharyn McCrumb in the Author\u2019s Note. The story starts off slow as Sharyn McCrumb develops the characters and the setting and we really got to know the characters and their surroundings, catching some of us right from the start but not grabbing us all. We all enjoyed Mary Jane\u2019s story as we learn of Zona\u2019s death and her suspicions as to the circumstances of her death. We could really feel Mary Jane\u2019s grief and anger. We all found her to be a strong character and liked her resilience, persistence and her determination for justice. Her confidence really shined through in this story.Where in the story we differ for our enjoyment was with the storyline involving lawyer, James Gardner as he recalls his backstory to Dr. Boozer. We all found the story to be dull and very slow and for some of us, it was really hard to get through it as it really dragged down the story for them. For me, I just wanted to get to Mary Jane\u2019s story and the trial and James\u2019 backstories distracted me from the suspense of the trial. The Unquiet Grave made for a very good discussion and it was interesting to see how parts of the story affected our level of enjoyment and ratings for this one. We varied from 2.5 to 4 stars with everyone having a different rating.

Gardner sits quietly in his darkened room in this former hotel now serving as an asylum for the insane. Although a renowned African American attorney of long standing in Lakin, West Virginia, Gardner had attempted suicide. Like the legal volumes stacked on his office shelf, life's complications carried oppressive weight and took up too much space.Dr. James Boozer, young and inexperienced, leans in closer and encourages Gardner to participate in the \"new talking cure\" being turned out now in 1930. Dr. Boozer returns for brief moments day after day until Gardner begins to reveal details of a most unusual murder case in 1897 in which a man was arrested on suspicion of killing his newly wed bride.Sharyn McCrumb presents a well-researched story based on a true crime that parallels along the lines of this Greenbrier Ghost. Locals stand fixated on the idea that some things just cannot be explained in worldly terms. McCrumb guides the reader down a fork in the road with tellings by James Gardner and with a very earthy rendition by the victim's own mother, Mary Jane Heaster. McCrumb sprinkles this with very colloquial dialogue aimed at bringing the reader into the full mix of this strange story.Zona Heaster, young with sparks afire, meets Eliasmus Trout Shue as if by the heavy twisted hand of a cruel fate. Trout, as he is called, is a newly arrived blacksmith in this small country town in West Virginia. His handsome face is his calling card and Zona clutches it to her heart. The voice of these chapters is Mary Jane's who tells of her daughter's questionable involvement with the shifty Trout. You feel the mother's anguish as Zona and Trout announce their upcoming nuptials.Mary Jane feels the severe disconnect as her daughter, Zona, seems to cut ties with the family immediately after the wedding. She fears for her daughter's well-being. It is only after Zona's death that Mary Jane receives \"messages\" from Zona herself which have been well-documented during this true trial. Although being a time ripe with Spiritualism, this mother points out directives from beyond the grave.I was drawn in by the time period, the well-developed characters, and the leaning full-handed on the facts of this case. I must say that McCrumb does web out her storyline with so many layers of memories and recollections by James Gardner that tend to bloat out the story at times. The crucial elements of Zona's story should have laid enough texture to this pie without unnecessary crumbs in the mix. But it is exactly the reality of Zona's short life and exhumation that draws you in like a beckoning hand. Oh, now that in itself is a tad bit unsettling, fellow readers.

Unfortunately, the dragging middle part was from about the 40% mark to the 97% mark. I started to lose interest around the halfway mark and had to force myself to keep reading.

I always enjoy reading historical fiction where I learn about a piece of history I knew little or nothing about. While I liked the educational piece of this book, I just couldn\u2019t connect with the 1930 storyline. It seemed to have a surplus of unnecessary details that were boring, distracting and repetitive. I completely lost interest during these chapters to the point that I was skimming paragraphs.I loved Mary Jane who was the main character in the 1897 storyline.

Her ballad books are food for my literary soul, with her hauntingly beautiful tales of the Appalachian Mountains folklore. This time she\u2019s veered away from those ballads with a historical novel based upon a true incident. There actually was a murder trial where the accused, Erasmus Trout Shue, was brought to trial for the murder of his wife, Zona Heaster Shue, based on the testimony of his deceased wife. Zona\u2019s mother attests to the fact that her deceased daughter appeared to her and told her how she was murdered, an autopsy was ordered and Trout Shue was brought to trial. The murder took place in 1897.The author has done a marvelous job of pulling out the facts from all of the folklore surrounding this murder. She researched census records, birth and death certificates, property records, maps and photographs and a long paper trail. She brings these people back to life and I was completely captivated by their story. The author lets her story be told alternately by Zona\u2019s mother, Mary Jane Heaster, and by Shue\u2019s attorney, James P.D. Gardner. Interestingly, Gardner tells his part of the story to a psychiatrist while he\u2019s confined to a mental hospital in 1930. Gardner was the first black attorney to practice law in the State of Virginia and this is his most memorable case.I would have given this fascinating account of such a very unusual trial 5 stars except for the quite lengthy examination of the checkered career of the lead prosecutor, W.P. Rucker. While I can certainly understand why the author wanted to include this since it\u2019s of historic interest, that part dragged a bit for me. My main interest in the book was the mother\u2019s quest for justice for her beloved daughter\u2019s murder. I felt such empathy for her as she struggled with her fears for her daughter as she entered this obviously unstable marriage and her grief when her daughter\u2019s life was so brutally ended.Recommended.This book was given to me by the publisher in return for an honest review."}, {"userName": "Darlene", "userReviewDate": "Jan 27, 2018", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/1809697-darlene", "userReview": "I confess that I sometimes enjoy watching the Travel Channel and in particular those shows pertaining to America's Most Haunted Places. When I discovered this novel,The Unquiet Grave written by Sharyn McCrumb, the description held a ring of familiarity for me. Then I remembered... this novel, based on a true crime which occurred in Greenbrier County, West Virginia in the late 19th century had also been featured on a show on the Travel Channel. This tale of the Greenbrier Ghost has become an important part of West Virginia folklore because it is also the true story of one of the strangest murder trials in American history... the first (and only) time the testimony of a ghost was admitted as evidence in a trial. I listened to the audiobook version of this novel and it was beautifully narrated by Candace Thaxton and Roger Casy. The book has two narrators and moves backward and forward through time, from 1897 to the 1930s. One of the narrators is African American attorney James P.D. Gardner. Mr. Gardner is telling a side of the story from his viewpoint as one of the defense attorneys in the murder trial which is at the center of this tale. In my view, James Gardner is a character which adds depth and clarity to the background of the story and is a tragic but strong character in his own right. The other narrator is Mary Jane Heaster. Mary Jane, matriarch of the Heaster family, works alongside her husband and children on a small patch of land in rural West Virginia, scratching out a living through farming. Waking before dawn and laboring until long after sunset, Mary Jane Heasteris not a woman who would be thought of as a 'shrinking violet'. She is outspoken, practical, no-nonsense , has a strong faith in God and certainly NOT a woman you would suspect of harboring wild superstitions. Getting a sense of Mary Jane's character is one of the things which makes the unfolding story so incredible. Mary Jane is the narrator of Zona Heaster's story. Zona is her only daughter. It's clear from the beginning that Mary Jane holds no illusions about her daughter and it is also apparent that she is exasperated by Zona and her inability and unwillingness to settle down. But along with the exasperation, I could also sense her concern and perhaps even a bit of admiration. Zona is a 'wild child'. At almost 21 years of age, Zone is not content to settle down on a farm with a husband and children. She wants to enjoy her life; and I got the sense that there was a part of Mary Jane that looked at her daughter wistfully. However, despite any secret admiration she might have felt for Zona, Mary Jane was a practical woman. So Zona was sent to stay with relatives in a nearby town and it was Mary Jane's hope that there Zona would begin top calm down. It is during this time that Zona meets a man who will change her life forever. As I was listening to this haunting story, I couldn't help but wonder if, in the many sleepless, anguished nights ahead, Mary Jane Heaster ever wished she could have taken back all the poking and prodding of Zona to get her to settle down and start her own family. Certainly Mary Jane knew better than anyone else how headstrong and stubborn Zona could be and yet, putting myself in her position, I think I would have given anything to take back all the words I said. In the months Zona lived with relatives, she met a handsome man who swept her off her feet and filled her head with romantic ideas. This man, Edward Trout Shue, who preferred being called 'Trout', was the new blacksmith in town but he was also a man with a secret past... one which included two former wives and a stay in the West Virginia state prison in Moundsville. Mary Jane took an instant dislike to Trout but Zona married him after knowing him for a very short time. Months later, the Heaster family was devastated by news of Zona's death from an apparent fall down the stairs. As soon as Mary Jane received news of Zona's death, she was convinced it was NOT an accident . She was sure Zona had been killed by her new husband ,Trout Shue. Although it was later revealed that Trout had acted strangely at the scene of the accident... not allowing the doctor to closely examine Zona's body.. Zona's deaths as ruled accidental and the case was closed to everyone except Mary Jane. She went to the district attorney and by insisting that Zona's ghost had visited her on three consecutive nights and revealed that she had been murdered, Mary Jane convinced the attorney to have the body exhumed. Upon autopsy, it was clear that Zona HAD, in fact, been murdered and her husband Trout Shue was arrested and ultimately convicted ... perhaps in part by the accumulated circumstantial evidence but maybe perhaps because of the unshakeable testimony provided by Mary Jane Heaster. Was Mary Jane Heater visited by the spirit of her murdered daughter? Well, you can decide that for yourself; but Ms. McCrumb DOES provide some tantalizing clues in the story as to what SHE believes happened. The narration provided by both attorney James Gardner and Mary Jane Heaster combines perfectly to present a snapshot in time of life in a small, rural West Virginia community at the turn of the 20th century. This picture shows that life was difficult and people were struggling with a segregated society. But it also shows a hard working and close-knit community. This piece of folklore was, to me, most of all a love story... a pure love story between a mother and her daughter. Mary Jane Heaster was a mother who accepted her child for all of her maddening faults and still loved her intensely. She made it her mission to ensure that her daughter's killer did not escape justice.Because you can find just about anything you are looking for online, I discovered a clip of the Greenbrier Ghost which I remembered from the Travel Channel show...http://www.travelchannel.com/videos/t..."}, {"userName": "Lori Lamothe", "userReviewDate": "Aug 19, 2017", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/69891978-lori-lamothe", "userReview": "Zona Heaster is a beautiful redhead who wants more out of life than the mountains of West Virginia can offer her in 1897. After secretly bearing a child out of wedlock, she takes up with a 35-year-old blacksmith whose good looks and easy charm are impossible to resist. Their whirlwind courtship doesn\u2019t last long, however, and within months of their wedding Zona is found dead. Everyone but Zona\u2019s mother accepts her death as a tragic accident and the funeral would likely have marked the end of her story\u2014if her ghost hadn\u2019t insisted on bringing her husband to trial. James P.D. Gardner is the first black attorney to practice law in West Virginia. He also happens to be involuntarily committed to a segregated insane asylum after a failed suicide attempt. More than three decades after Gardner helped defend Zona\u2019s husband, a young doctor convinces him to try the new \u201ctalking cure.\u201d Over the course of his stay at the asylum, Gardner recounts the events surrounding the blacksmith\u2019s trial and grapples with his own problems. Told in alternating POV\u2019s between Gardner and Zona\u2019s mother Mary Jane, \"The Unquiet Grave\" is a well-researched novel that resurrects a fascinating historical tale. In a sense, this book is more true crime than fiction because the events Sharyn McCrumb writes about are not invented and many of the smallest details are based on official documents. Beginning with an entry in a folklore book that was less than two pages long, McCrumb set out to uncover the facts behind the Greenbrier Ghost legend and she succeeded. Her novel not only gives a clear picture of the trial but also creates a layered depiction of West Virginia at the end of the nineteenth century. As is true of all the ballad novels, \"The Unquiet Grave\" is far more than a mystery to be unraveled. McCrumb\u2019s knowledge of Appalachia, as well as her feeling for the region\u2019s land and its people, allows her to transcend genre and create works of lasting merit. She is a truly gifted writer.I would warn readers not to enter into this book expecting the page-turning suspense of the earlier ballad novels. This novel isn\u2019t set in Dark Hollow, Tennesee and familiar characters like Sheriff Spencer Arrowood and Nora Bonesteel don\u2019t make an appearance. There is no mystery to solve, per se, and the pacing is slow at times, especially in Gardner\u2019s chapters. McCrumb\u2019s quirky brand of humor (which I love) is also absent. That said, \"The Unquiet Grave\" recounts a forgotten slice of history that deserves to be told. And if you haven\u2019t read her other ballad novels, I highly recommend them.Much thanks to Atria Books and NetGalley for providing me an ARC in exchange for an honest review."}, {"userName": "Ioana", "userReviewDate": "Sep 27, 2017", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/1721356-ioana", "userReview": "5 stars for the meticulous historical research McCrumb undertook and for her attention to contextual nuance and details. I was leaning towards 4 stars until I finished the novel and came upon the Author's Note, which explained the basis of The Unquiet Grave as the folktale of the Greenbrier Ghost of West Virginia, a tale born of the real life story of Zona Heaster Shue (pictured below).Zona Heaster ShueZona Heaster Shue was a young, beautiful farmers' daughter who married an equally handsome blacksmith, a man we would easily recognize today as a classic abuser (though at the time, in the late 19th century, the language to describe this behavior was not widely used or understood). Soon after her wedding, Zona's body was found (in the house pictured below), allegedly dead from a fall. However, suspicious circumstances in her husband's behavior and past (such as an abused ex-wife and another prior wife dead from a \"fall\") lead Mary Jane Heaster, Zona's mother, to believe that Trout Shue had killed his wife. Unable to think of another way to bring Shue to justice, Mary Jane recounted a story to the county prosecutor, John Alfred Preston, about her daughter's ghost returning to tell the tale of her murder; intrigued, Preston ordered an exhumation of Zona's body and found that, indeed, her neck had been wrung.The house where Zona was killedThe novel alternates timelines between the late 19th century, mostly spoken in the voice of Zona's mother, Mary Jane (pictured below), and the 1930s, which presents the story as remembered by a lawyer from Trout Shue's trial. The 19th century timeline vividly depicts West Virginia small-town/farm life in the era and brings the region fully to life while sketching realistic portraits of characters who might have populated the landscape of the times. This part, I loved (I've been on a rural-America binge for some months now, and McCrumb skilfully transports the reader to the region). The 1930s timeline also fascinated me, seeing as the location is a segregated asylum; one of Shue's lawyers, a black man, recounts his life and the trial to the resident psychiatrist.Mary Jane Heaster, Zona's motherHad The Unquiet Grave been pure fiction, I may have had some quibbles with the structure of the story, such as, for example, the integration of the 1930s timeline (why a psychiatrist would talk for hours on end about a patient's former vocation, without touching on his psyche/psychic condition, is a hard sell). Still, since McCrumb quite evidently spent years in archives and historical sites, speaking with experts, and even making a quite obscure (and original) connection to a similar case in England, imo she deserves a full rating for the precision of her research, as well as for the ways in which she brings the region to life."}, {"userName": "Jenny", "userReviewDate": "Mar 08, 2018", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/3501645-jenny", "userReview": "This is my second attempt to read this book.

I had a very hard time staying focused and invested in the story and there was just too many details and recollections from James that just did not seem relevant to the story at all.I really enjoyed the character of Mary Jane and I really loved how this was based on a true story.

More shocking is that one night Zona appears to her mother to tell her that her new husband murdered her.

An account of actual events in Greenbrier County in 1897 told in a poetic prose of a mother Mary Jane and the killer's defense attorney James P Gardner years later. The narration goes back and forth in time with the mother's relationship with her daughter Zona. A beautiful girl full of spunk and determination. Zona falls fast and hard for Trout Shue a blacksmith who has been married before. Mary Jane is not ignorant of her daughter's misgivings however, she feels that something is amiss months later after the wedding. When her daughter is discovered dead, she knows that Zona's husband is to blame. With great courage, Mary Jane goes to the prosecutor with a tale of the Ghost of her daughter that she was murdered and did not suffer an accident but a violent death in the hands of her husband. Gardner is assigned to Trout's case and years later relives the tale in the Asylum under the care of Dr. James Boozer. The narrations give different perspectives of the culture on race and justice. It is a haunting tale of a mother's grief and Gardner's part of the defense of Shue. Retelling his part, you question whether he has regrets in the process of justice. A different historical fiction with intrigue and the stories of the past forgotten but given new life.

Here her dry, dark humor combines with her expertise in Appalachian culture and above all, her deep respect for the working poor, and the result is a masterpiece of an historical mystery. Thanks to Net galley for the DRC, and to Atria for sending a hard copy galley and a finished copy of this excellent novel. However, had I paid full freight, I\u2019d have come away happy. This book will be available to the public September 12, 2017.Based upon the legend of the Greenbrier Ghost, our story is set in West Virginia in 1897. Zola Heaster is swept away by the handsome young blacksmith that comes to her tiny Appalachian farming community. Her story is told to us primarily in a first person narrative by her mother, Mary Jane. Magnetic physical attraction overwhelms any common sense Zona may possess\u2014which isn\u2019t much\u2014so when the handsome stranger comes along, Zona tumbles:\u201cZona was well nigh smirking at him\u2014cat-in-the-cream-jug smug, she was. Well, Mr. Shue\u2014the name fits the trade, I see\u2014I am Miss Zona Heaster, a visitor to my cousin\u2019s house, here. How do\u2026Well before Edward \u2018Call me Trout\u2019 Shue came ambling along, with his possum grin and his storybook profile, we\u2019d had trouble with Zona.\u201dBefore we can draw breath, Zona is pregnant. It isn\u2019t the first time, either, though the first was kept quiet, settled out of the area. As her mother wonders whether Trout will want to marry her, Zona brags,\u201c\u2019He\u2019d be lucky to have me.\u2019 \u201c\u2019Well, Zona, it seems that he already has.\u2019\u201dMary Jane doesn\u2019t like her daughter\u2019s suitor, and a number of small but troubling things make her reluctant to see this wedding take place, even given the shotgun-wedding circumstances. We are disquieted, not by huge monstrous overt acts by Shue, but by the small hints that provide a deeper suspicion, a sense of foreboding. Part of McCrumb\u2019s genius is in knowing when less is more.Ultimately, Zona marries and moves away, and is little heard from. Too little. And here is the mother\u2019s dilemma that most of us will recognize: how much should a mother pry? Will it make things better to follow our nose to the source of trouble; can we help? Or will our efforts only antagonize one or both of the newlyweds? And I love Zona\u2019s father, the laconic Jacob who tells his wife that Zona has made the choice to marry, and she\u2019s made the choice to stay there, so \u201cLet her go, Mary Jane.\u201d But it\u2019s a terrible mistake. A secondary thread alternates with this one. The year is 1930; attorney James P.D. Gardner is consigned to a segregated insane asylum following a suicide attempt. His doctor is the young James Boozer, who has decided to try the new technique that involves talking to one\u2019s patients. This device works wonderfully here because it provides Gardner the opportunity to discuss a particularly interesting case he tried many years prior, one that involved defending a white man accused of murdering his wife. The conversation flows organically, rather than as a monologue shoehorned into the prose. I am surprised at first to see McCrumb write dialogue for African-American men; I don\u2019t think she has done this before, although I can\u2019t swear to this.( I have been reading her work since the 90s and may have forgotten a few things along the way.) The dialogue between Gardner and Boozer is dignified and natural, and this is a relief; those that have read my reviews know that there have been others that failed in this regard. And just as the discussion starts to drone\u2014intentional, since one of the two men yawns just at the moment I do\u2014everything wakes up, and we learn about the trial of Trout Shue from a different vantage point. Every aspect of this novel is done with the authority and mastery of Appalachian fiction for which McCrumb is legendary. The dialect is so resonant that I find myself using it in writing, speech, and even thought\u2014just tiny snippets here and there\u2014and then laughing at myself. And I cannot help wondering how much of it stewed its way into McCrumb\u2019s own conversations while she was writing. You may find it in yours.The result here is spellbinding, and the use of Appalachian legend, herbal medicine, and folklore makes it all the more mesmerizing. Again, skill and experience tell here. How many novels have I read in which an author\u2019s research is shoehorned in to such a degree that it hijacks the plot? Not so here. The cultural tidbits are an integral part of Mary Jane\u2019s personality, and there\u2019s no teasing them apart. Instead of distracting as it might in less capable hands, the folklore develops character and setting, and ultimately contributes to the plot, when Zona\u2019s ghost returns to let Mary Jane know that she has been murdered. This is no-can-miss fiction, strongly recommended to those with a solid command of the English language and a love of great literature."}, {"userName": "CoffeeandInk", "userReviewDate": "Aug 10, 2017", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/67831279-coffeeandink", "userReview": "The Unquiet Grave is a retelling of a folk story about a ghost who appeared as a witness at the trial of the man who murdered her, through her mother. The narrative is broken up, as far as the timeline and point of view, between the mother\u2019s present in 1897 and the lawyer\u2019s assistant in a 1930s asylum. It\u2019s based on real life and though at times I felt impatient with the various characters involved with the trial, it\u2019s the mother, Mary Jane, and the details of her life in West Virginia and her pursuit for justice that had me engrossed. The big story question, did she make up the part about seeing her daughter\u2019s ghost? is not quite resolved, though her gut instincts about the murderer help to get the killer prosecuted. A truly fascinating study of domestic violence.I\u2019d forgotten what a powerful and compelling storyteller the author is, and I\u2019m ready to go back to her backlist to see what I\u2019ve missed."}, {"userName": "Michelle", "userReviewDate": "Aug 17, 2017", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/3086082-michelle", "userReview": "The Unquiet Grave is an interesting story with no real lasting power. I suspect it means more to those who are familiar with the folklore prior to reading the novel. Even without any prior knowledge, very little of the story is an actual surprise. Ms. McCrumb is very heavy-handed in her foreshadowing, and the modern-day obsession with true crime stories makes it all too easy to see where Zona\u2019s story is heading.From a historical perspective, Ms. McCrumb gives readers a decent insight into the lasting tension that existed even forty years after the Civil War. She raises awareness that this was more than racial tension, although that did obviously exist. Things like someone\u2019s war record, in which campaigns they fought, for which side, all played a role in establishing someone\u2019s position in society. Set in the foothills of West Virginia, it is a side of the turn-of-the-century America most readers do not get to see.She also paints a realistic picture of the hardships farmers in Appalachia faced. These are not the coal farmers one typically thinks of when envisioning West Virginia. These are the types of farmers who founded our country \u2013 small, family-owned, barely able to survive in the lean times, for whom frivolous things like a separate dress for a wedding is as unthinkable as it is unpractical. Understanding Zona\u2019s background makes it easier to understand why she married a man she barely knew as well as the reasons her mother did not discover her fate until it was too late.Had the story stayed focused solely on Mary Jane, the flow would be smoother and more engaging. Unfortunately, the story splits its time between Mary Jane\u2019s search for justice and that of one of the lawyers assigned to the case. Except Gardner\u2019s story takes place forty years after the fact, so the context is wrong. Plus, we find out that he was not the head lawyer for the case. He was nothing but the associate lawyer assigned to do most of the research. His role in the novel is misleading and disappointing and more than a little confusing. Some of this is because of his lack of role in the proceedings. The rest is due to the shift not only in narrator but also in point of view. With Mary Jane, we get a first person perspective, allowed access inside her mind as she processes her life and her actions. With Gardner, it is a third-person limited point of view. We only learn his story as he tells it to his doctor. It is too distant in time and perspective to blend well with Mary Jane\u2019s sections of the novel, and they did nothing to improve my understanding or enjoyment of the story. I often found myself skimming if not skipping entire passages of Dr. Gardner\u2019s scenes in order to get past them as quickly as possible.Much like the mode of travel Mary Jane must use to travel to see her daughter, The Unquiet Grave is a relatively slow, plodding novel. The details about Mary Jane\u2019s life and her search for clues is interesting and one of the saving graces of the story. The rest is a meandering slog through racial, socio-economic, and generational tensions that attempt to establish the setting but do more to distract and disengage. The scenes involving Gardner are disappointing and relatively meaningless in the overall context of the story. Those potential readers who already know the story of The Greenbriar Ghost may have a greater appreciation for The Unquiet Grave and Ms. McCrumb\u2019s research into the details behind the legend. As it is, I found it a tedious read with only occasional sections of historical interest."}, {"userName": "lucky little cat", "userReviewDate": "Sep 29, 2017", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/38160628-lucky-little-cat", "userReview": "[It won't be enough to save the girl.

My sisters and I were scared, but always wanted to learn more. The description of rural Appalachia where life was tough and those who lived there, in order to survive, were tougher. A young girl, Zona Heaster, is more than a bit foolish and unwise and has an out-of-wedlock child. Her mother gave the baby away to an older couple. Already tarnished by the standards of the time, Zona, suddenly latches on to an older man who seems to be steady and holds a job.After a quick marriage, she is whisked away a few hours from her parents. The husband dominates and thus the girl has no contact with her family. In a short period of time, Zona is dead. Saddened, her mother brings the body back home for burial. Suspiciously, her Zona's husband protects the coffin and the body.Grieving, the mother wonders what she could have done. In her sleep, Zona appears in a dream, and her mother is led to believe her daughter was murdered by a breakage to her neck.The defense team contained an African American man, who now, years later lives in an asylum for colored people.

But the premise of a murder case with a ghost as a witness hooked me. The author switched between the voice of the main narrator and the story of a lawyer locked in an insane asylum. This seemed a little clunky at the beginning and I did not figure out the connection between the two until I was over halfway through the book. The author did a good job of tying up all the loose ends and revealing what happened to the main characters after the trial.

Through dual points of views and tenses, we are introduced to James P. D.Gardner and Mary Jane Heaster and shown the depths of a mother\u2019s love and the extraordinary lengths she will go to for justice.Our story begins in a segregated insane asylum in the 1930s. An older black gentleman, James P. D. Gardner, has been committed for attempting suicide and the attending physician feels that discussing the past is what holds the key to the problems of the present. James decides to tell the Dr about the time he was asked to co-chair a murder trial in West Virginia with a white union sympathizing defense attorney whose past was far more scandalous than the accused, a white Confederate veteran prosecutor, and where a ghost was the only witness to the crime. From there, we switch to Mary Jane Heaster as she leads us up to the trial. Gardner then resumes his tale, describing the events of the trial and his actions defending the accused with Mary Jane interjecting as needed.Elva Zona Heaster was a wild child from the day she was born. Beautiful and headstrong, she refused to bow down to the dictates of parents or society and did as she pleased regardless of the outcome. While visiting family in Greenbrier County, she meets Erasmus (Edward) Trout Shue, an older handsome drifter who had recently moved there and worked as a blacksmith. Zona falls head over heels and against her mother\u2019s advice, marries Edward. After weeks of silence, Mary Jane and her oldest son ride to the Shue\u2019s home to check on Zona. Mary Jane eventually heads home, fearful for Zona. When riders come to the Heaster farm a few months later to inform them that Zona has died from a fall down the stairs, Mary Jane is convinced Edward killed Zona. Mary Jane goes to the local prosecutor and demands Edward be arrested for murder. She claims Zona\u2019s ghost has come to her, showing her proof of Edward\u2019s lies. She convinces the prosecutor to order an exhumation of the body. The examination shows foul play, Edward is arrested, and a trial date set.When I first picked this up, I read it fell under McCrumb\u2019s Appalachian Ballad series though I didn\u2019t see the connection. I did enjoy the story though it is definitely drier then what I\u2019m used to from her. Hints of McCrumb\u2019s trademark sly humor in her formattable characters and descriptive narrative help liven it up and force it along when it faltered. I had never heard of the Greenbrier Ghost before this but found McCrumb\u2019s weaving of legend, fact, and fiction interesting, especially her use of the mother and the defense attorney to personalize the story.Though the story starts out ponderous, your curiously is gradually peaked with its haunting prose and straightforward telling. McCrumb\u2019s research and meticulous attention to detail are showcased as she uses her skills and alternating points of view to paint us a picture of life in the rural South among the working class; drawing attention to the domestic violence and the social, economic, gender and race inequalities that existed. Heavily character driven, Heaster Gardner are the driving forces of the story, both compelling characters whose refusal to sugar coat their circumstances only adds to their appeal. Both are non-apologetic of what they are, accepting their place in life as simply a fact. Yet, there is intelligence, fortitude, and a quiet strength in them both, evidenced by their relentless pursuit of their goals.The ending is predictable of course but McCrumb adds her own twists to the story, leaving readers to question some of the ethical and moral dilemmas presented. An in-depth epilogue offers more answers and questions as McCrumb lays the story and those involved to rest.I do wish Gardner\u2019s personal story had integrated better with the main storyline. As it was, I felt as though I was reading two distinctly different stories with no true common denominator. I also found the history lesson given on the civil war and the parts the defense attorney and the prosecutor played in it overly verbose and cumbersome. The point of that escaped me. Regardless, fans of Sharyn McCrumb and American Folklore are sure to enjoy her take on this popular piece of southern history.

There\u2019s the hauntingly sad story of Zona, a young woman from West Virginia, historically known as The Greenbrier Ghost. And then there\u2019s another more current story of attorney James P.D. Gardner, confined in a segregational insane asylum. The chapters flip back and forth between the two individual stories through most of the book. I related so much more to Zona\u2019s story and felt the heartbreak and pain her mother endured. Their family was into farming and they were quite poor. They pretty much kept to themselves except for Zona. Outsiders were rare to pass through town or even stay without gossip unfolding; but if there was an eligible male for Zona, she was all over it. Nothing would stop Zona from being Zona - the church gossipers, her parents and their angst over her and her behavior and their prohibitions which she had total disregard for. Zona\u2019s mother was quite in tune and knowing of her daughter and her personality and tries to teach Zona to be cautious, to no avail. When Zona wants something, she goes after it. Zona\u2019s father pretty much gave up on her over time; her constant ruckus was something he neither had time nor energy for. And so the story unfolds of this beautiful, precocious, irresponsible woman whose continual poor choices eventually determine her final lot in life. James P.D. Gardner, while (perhaps wrongly?) situated in the insane asylum, ponders his past life and high profile legal cases and partnerships with Dr. Boozer, staff physician at the asylum. Dr. Boozer is intrigued by JPDG personally and professionally and the more he gets to know JPDG the more he feels the man does not belong there. So there is a lot of back and forth detail from JPDG as he recalls his family life, education and practice to the good doctor. To me, this was quite a bit of dry filler - most of it was uninteresting to me - but there is a surprise tie in to the first story. I would give Zona\u2019s piece of the story 3 stars but would give JPDG only 2 stars because his portion did not reasonate as well with me."}], "description": "From New York Times bestselling author Sharyn McCrumb comes a finely wrought novel set in nineteenth-century West Virginia, based on the true story of one of the strangest murder trials in American history\u2014the case of the Greenbrier Ghost.Lakin, West Virginia, 1930 Following a suicide attempt and consigned to a segregated insane asylum, attorney James P.
