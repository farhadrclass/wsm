I never tire of this theme, though I never thought I'd see the day that a steampunk version was born :-DCuriosity is what leads the reader throughout the story. I was curious about this Isabelle who is into mechanics, clockwork, books of ancient artifacts, and lives in a London brimming with airships and Tinker markets. The first part of the book has a cozy atmosphere and a sense of adventure as she and her father make preparations to embark on a sea journey that will change their lives.I got really excited as the events mirrored this tale as old as time, yet with a vibrant layer of steampunk creativity. Therefore, I stayed curious as folklore magic and bewildering curses created a new angle on the Beast, his servants and his land. They all seemed delightfully mysterious, innovated, forlorn, and so very steampunk!Admittedly, I'd expected a heavier dose of romance. However, Isabelle is a brave, smart and spirited woman who never ceases to explore, build fantastical clockwork machines, and discover secrets and puzzles. I adored her. The climax of the story is full of drama, adventure and emotion. The romance finally paid off as Isabelle shows courage and infinite determination to save the beast she's come to love.Beautiful, imaginative and rich retelling with a marvelous steampunk twist that I truly loved. I sincerely hope this fairy tale collection keeps growing."}, {"userName": "Michelle ", "userReviewDate": "Dec 11, 2017", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/11618764-michelle", "userReview": "I meant to do this review a few weeks ago because this book was amazing. The Steampunk FairyTale series has some connections between characters and I do enjoy reading them in order however I think it can be read as a standalone also. This story is about Isabella the book loving,\u00a0mechanics, clockwork maker who finds herself on an enchanted Island with mysterious clockwork people. I adored how this story followed the classic story of beauty and the beast but with a steampunk twist.The story is set a little before the end of Ice and Ember. You sort of meet up with the end of the story and you are seeing a few things in Isabella's point of view. I really liked her and the clockwork pieces that she made before her voyage seemed so amazing, I actually want one. I love the details about the clockwork pieces and also within the world. Melanie paints a very pretty picture helping you really get a feel for the world and the characters. Isabella was a wonderful character and the chemistry between her and\u00a0Rhys was sweet. I was really rooting for them as it got closer to the end.This series is quickly become a favorite for me. Melanie Karsak is an amazing author and I am loving her books and plan to devour a lot more this year. I can't recommend this book enough and the series. I would recommend reading it in order but however you choose to read them I do hope you love them as much as I did! :)Thanks for stopping by to check out my review.Have a great day and Happy Reading!\nThis review was originally posted on Because reading is better than real life"}, {"userName": "Jeanie", "userReviewDate": "Mar 23, 2018", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/16647349-jeanie", "userReview": "Perfectly funI love Beauty and the Beast stories and this one was so fun.

Ho battuto le mani quando l\u2019ho letto, perch\u00e9 \u00e8 riuscita a togliere un contesto negativo ahim\u00e8 presente spesso negli YA. Lui mi tratta male, mi picchia, \u00e8 cattivo con me, lo amo tantissimo.Qui non \u00e8 affatto cos\u00ec. Le invenzioni steampunk, le meraviglie costruite con metallo sono magiche, se fosse trasposto in film o almeno in cartoni renderebbe benissimo.L\u2019autrice ha mischiato anche folklore inglese, romanticismo, sentimenti e azione, senza tralasciare il fatto che alcuni dei capitoli hanno i titoli delle famose canzoni disney, come Be Our Guest!!E cosa ancora pi\u00f9 importante: ha dato un ruolo di rilievo a tutte le donne nella narrazione, non solo la protagonista: lei non \u00e8 superiore alle altre, non odia tutte le altre, aiuta chiunque come pu\u00f2, e ad un certo punto, in necessit\u00e0 di un pilota di airship, trova Lily, comandante. Donna ovviamente.In conclusione: \u00e8 uno standalone, leggetelo senza problemi; mi \u00e8 piaciuto tantissimo, in un modo che forse non riesco neanche ad esprimere, e ringrazio l\u2019autrice per avermi incluso nel team e averlo potuto leggere in anteprima.ENG:I can\u2019t express how much I loved this book!I read a lot of retelling in the past years, I even partecipate in a challenge based on retellings, and I never found one that I really really like. For example: I like the idea of Dorothy Must Die, but I didn\u2019t like the MC.But Isabelle Hawking is a great main character! She\u2019s strong, and intelligent, she doesn\u2019t despise the other girls, and she creates wonderful creations made of metal and music.First of all: some of the chapters title are the same of the famous songs from the movies! I don\u2019t know you, but I sing those songs a lot. No, I\u2019m not a good singer.Second: the author has turn down the Stockolm syndrome tipically associated with this tale. So we don\u2019t have a Beast very angry, and bad and violent with Isabelle, and she isn\u2019t a passive character. This is so important to me, because Melanie Karsak spread a great message with that: violence is not love.Obviously, there is romance in this book, and drama and adventure, all mixed. I\u2019m not a romantic girl, but I found it so cute!The world that the author has written is beautiful: I have a special place in my heart for steampunk settings, and this is incredible. Just imagine the castle where the beast live, like in the last movie, but all made in metal, and clockwork. To this world, add some airship, fairies and Celtic folklore.All the female characters in the book are great: the fairy that has cast the spell on the castle, Isabelle, and Lily, an amazing airship\u2019s captain that has her own adventure in another book, \u201cChasing The Star Garden\u201d."}, {"userName": "Lene Blackthorn ", "userReviewDate": "Jan 12, 2018", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/47983251-lene-blackthorn", "userReview": "One very enticing, enchanting, and unique twist on the classic fairytale that I utterly enjoyed. Isabelle and her father are tinkers, both very skilled in mechanics, and preparing for a journey to a noble wedding. On the way, they get shipwrecked and end on a mysterious island, cursed and bewitched. Isabelle stays, so that her father could leave and fetch help - and meanwhile, opens her heart to the strange situation in the castle dominating the island. Cursed to live as automatons, Isabelle is determined to find the key to break the curse. Of all the retellings of the Beauty and the Beast, this one was one of my favorites. The blossoming romance between Belle and her beast seemed more natural with Rhys behaving as gentleman, although bitter and detached at first because of the curse. As a bookworm and intellectual, Belle was always one of my two favorite princesses, and I loved to watch her in the men's world of clockwork and metal. The touch of magic in the character of the cruel fairy was decent, and yet it created the right atmosphere and strong feeling of its presence. I absolutely adore steampunk, and seeing one of my favorite stories set into this era with such skill and finesse was a blessing."}, {"userName": "Patrick Barnes", "userReviewDate": "Jan 17, 2018", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/63952706-patrick-barnes", "userReview": "HeadyShe has done an awesome job.

The latest in the author's series of steampunk twists on fairytales, this is a new version of Beauty and the Beast (like you hadn't guessed from the title!!), and readers of the other books in the series will note that it stars Isabelle Hawking, the tinker seen in the Ice Queen story with her father (also seen in this book). I won't go into the plot of this story any further - you can get the basics from the book description above, and more than that would be spoilers! - but I'd like to commend the author on her imaginative retelling of the story, and the details she brings to it (I especially loved the garden and the folly descriptions). I highly recommend both this book (which can be read as a standalone) and the whole series to anyone who loves steampunk and fairytale retellings - the combination of the two in these is just divine!

A 3.5 would more accurately reflect how I felt about the novel. The story follows the plot of the well-known story of Beauty and the Beast, according to the Disney classic (Heroine is the daughter of an inventor, is pursued by an undesirable and conceited marriage prospect, is lost in an enchanted castle where she eventually helps a cursed lord/royal find his humanity, the enchantment is broken, and they live happily ever after). Due to the non-originality of the plot, I gave this book a 3. However, I love what Karsak does with the characters. The heroine in Beauty & Beastly, Isabella, is the daughter of a mechanic. She is an expert in clockworks where she mends clockwork and music together in her musical boxes. I love that Isabella is a stubborn mechanic and tinkerer who ends her days full of oil and grime. I appreciate that the author does not sexualize Isabella nor overemphasizes her beauty. Thus, the cursed castle and all the automatons are eventually saved due to her engineering capabilities & ability to emphasize rather than her beauty. The read itself is easy and does not pose a challenge. Being accustomed to more challenging prose and complex plots, I found the ease a bit frustrating (if that's even possible). The novel is great for pre-teens & young adults, and of course, an adult who likes fantasy--like myself. I would definitely read more of Melanie Karsak's Steampunk Fairy Tales series."}, {"userName": "Simone Everett", "userReviewDate": "Feb 26, 2018", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/34025357-simone-everett", "userReview": "It was ehI decided to read this book because a friend liked it, also because I never read anything with a steampunk theme to it. To me, it only seemed like Isabelle fell in love with him because she saw the human form of him in the mirror. The mirror as well as some other aspects of the story seemed very forced. She could have made this her own story because it was trying way to hard to fit into the mold of the typical beauty and the beast story. Also the ending seemed to be very rushed and had a lack of detailing."}, {"userName": "Dominique", "userReviewDate": "Jan 02, 2018", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/8786722-dominique", "userReview": "This book was a fun and interesting entrant for me into the world of steampunk fiction. I\u2019ve long loved the idea of steampunk fiction, but I never really got the chance to read one until now. And fairytale parodies are always a fun read.I\u2019ll admit I\u2019ve never read the classic Beauty and the Beast, but reading through Melanie Karsak\u2019s steampunk version of the story, I definitely felt it had a lot of elements of Disney\u2019s take on the famous tale.What I liked about the book is the superb blend of mechanics and magic, not to mention the very active role Isabelle Hawking played throughout the story. The Celtic inspiration is one that\u2019s particularly fascinating to me, so I highly appreciated these elements in the story. As for Isabelle, in the beginning she reminded me of Emma Watson\u2019s portrayal of Belle in the movie: smart, sassy, and doesn\u2019t have time for nonsense, especially from Gerard LeBeouf (i.e., Gaston, in the original Disney movie). What I most admired about the characterization of Isabelle is her curiosity and stubbornness that led her to discover for herself the curse on the castle. There\u2019s a lot to be said about this, but I wouldn\u2019t want to spoil the story too much.What I felt could have been done better: For one, there are still a couple of errors that could be fixed with editing (e.g., wrong word, spelling errors, etc.). On the technical side, I sometimes thought some of the chapters were too short? Like, it was a short scene that, while important, could perhaps have been part of a larger scheme\u2014but I\u2019m not a literary expert by any means, so don\u2019t take my word for it. That aside, while I did enjoy the differences in the characterization of various characters: the Beast, Isabelle\u2019s father, Missus Silver (Mrs. Potts), and even Gerard, the latter part of the book felt like these characters could have been developed further, but... can you say a cliffhanger for their characterization? I\u2019m thinking particularly of Isabelle\u2019s father and Gerard. There was so much more that I felt could have been said about them, more of a role for Gerard too, but it just... ended.Overall though, I really did enjoy this tale! Like I mentioned at the start, it was a great first book in both steampunk fiction and on Melanie Karsak\u2019s writing; I definitely want to check out more of Karsak\u2019s writing after this. If you want a lighthearted read, I would recommend this one. :)P.S. I received a copy of this book on the condition that I would review it.

Melanie Karsak writes stories in a number of different genres including steampunk. Her recent adaptation of Beauty and the Beast into a steampunk version was a delight to read. I am fairly new to steampunk, and I actually cut my teeth on one of her earlier novels. So I was excited to see what she had to offer this time. Enter Isabelle and Rhys. Isabelle is a tinker who lives with her father and loves her life of discovering new creations. They set out on a voyage to deliver specially ordered gifts to a wedding, when their ship encounters a storm and Isabelle finds herself washed ashore on a strange island. She wanders inland, hoping to find her father and other survivors. She instead finds a strange castle-like building with a courtyard of beautiful flowers, all in silver. And inside the building she finds her father- captured and locked away! His captor is a mechanical, who accuses him of stealing a rose from his garden. Her father admits to taking the rose, but only to examine it to see how it was made. This story follows the original in a loose manner, using similar characters but leaving room to allow for new characters and different plot twists.

While Beauty and Beastly may follow along the same lines of the classic Beauty and the Beast, it also has its very own unique spin that I absolutely loved! This one captured some of my favorite parts in Beauty in the Beast. I really enjoyed the characters and the slight differences they have to their classic counterparts. I also liked how the romance was gentle and we didn\u2019t have a mean and horrendous beast. I was really surprised with the way fairies and Celtic folklore played a major part with the islands curse. Overall, I would definitely recommend this book.

Steampunk, YES. Fairytale retelling, YES! This had promise of being 5 stars but unfortunately, while I did enjoy it, I found I was a bit bored with parts. The beginning was strong but about midway through it just drifted. There was a huge resemblance to the classic story 'Beauty and the Beast's which I'm torn between liking and not liking. I'm thinking there was too much likeness which is why I got a bit bored. I'd knew the original story well so it felt at times that I was re-reading the same thing. BUT with saying that, I still did like parts, as I said, the beginning was very good. Good enough to that I'm willing to give the authors other books a try.

Short and moving The author says in the note that she wanted a story that fixed the stockholm syndrome and the rude behaviour of the beast and while I understand her (and I love the Disney version); the Disney version is not the original.The beast was very much a nice and gentle guy right from the start in both Villenueve's and Beaumont's version I encourage everyone to read the og."}], "description": "In this tale as old as time, Isabella Hawking must tinker a solution to a heartbreaking mystery.\n When Isabelle and her papa set out from London on a sea voyage, Isabelle was thrilled. Visiting foreign courts, learning from master tinkers, and studying new ways to manipulate mechanicals sounded like a dream.\u00a0But an unexpected gale turns the waters violent, and the ship is lost. Isabelle survives the tempest only to be shipwrecked on a seemingly-deserted island. Dotted with standing stones, faerie mounds, and a crumbling castle, the haunting place hints of a magical past. Isabelle may be an unwitting guest, but her arrival at the forgotten citadel heralds a new beginning for the beastly residents inside.\nBeauty and Beastly is a retelling of the classic Beauty and the Beast fairy tale set in 1814 Regency England.", "title": "Beauty and Beastly\n      \n          (Steampunk Fairy Tales #1)", "url": "http://www.goodreads.com/book/show/36007958-beauty-and-beastly", "average": 4.24, "cover": "https://images.gr-assets.com/books/1502556707l/36007958.jpg", "reviews": 75, "authors": [{"url": "https://www.goodreads.com/author/show/6539577.Melanie_Karsak", "name": "Melanie Karsak"}], "type": ["Science Fiction", "Fantasy", "Fairy Tales", "Romance", "Fantasy"], "outlinks": ["http://www.goodreads.com/book/show/36007958-beauty-and-beastly", "http://www.goodreads.com/book/show/31675361-the-harvesting", "http://www.goodreads.com/book/show/18683809-chasing-the-star-garden", "http://www.goodreads.com/book/show/36600972-mistletoe-and-mischief", "http://www.goodreads.com/book/show/28581456-highland-blood", "http://www.goodreads.com/book/show/35174857-curiouser-and-curiouser", "http://www.goodreads.com/book/show/19755140-embassytown", "http://www.goodreads.com/book/show/32858845-off-to-be-the-wizard", "http://www.goodreads.com/book/show/33616599-beneath-the-shine", "http://www.goodreads.com/book/show/10931746-the-stepford-wives", "http://www.goodreads.com/book/show/22583196-time-s-divide", "http://www.goodreads.com/book/show/13604418-the-long-earth", "http://www.goodreads.com/book/show/20526820-gilded", "http://www.goodreads.com/book/show/26580636-infinity-lost", "http://www.goodreads.com/book/show/34111309-the-man-of-legends", "http://www.goodreads.com/book/show/31139576-all-the-breaking-waves", "http://www.goodreads.com/book/show/40193375-fellside", "http://www.goodreads.com/book/show/18108877-timebound", "http://www.goodreads.com/book/show/25071002-the-banished-of-muirwood", "http://www.goodreads.com/book/show/40204943-muirwood", "http://www.goodreads.com/book/show/18806963-prayers-to-broken-stones", "http://www.goodreads.com/book/show/18126623-2061", "http://www.goodreads.com/book/show/29425329-alas-babylon", "http://www.goodreads.com/book/show/40193696-3001", "http://www.goodreads.com/book/show/40205002-fractured", "http://www.goodreads.com/book/show/29103028-the-queen-s-poisoner", "http://www.goodreads.com/book/show/40269681-zeroes", "http://www.goodreads.com/book/show/18162904-dreams-and-shadows", "http://www.goodreads.com/book/show/36316055-touch-of-eternity", "http://www.goodreads.com/book/show/35106805-touch", "http://www.goodreads.com/book/show/40192858-dragon-rider", "http://www.goodreads.com/book/show/25353286-provenance", "http://www.goodreads.com/book/show/23249416-an-unwelcome-quest"]}
