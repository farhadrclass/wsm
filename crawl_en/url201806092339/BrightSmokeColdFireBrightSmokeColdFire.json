And it would be better titled \"Romeo and Juliet and Zombies\".It's not because Romeo and Juliet is an epic emofest of the instalove variety. I was still excited to see what Hodge would do with this story, and Caine's Prince of Shadows - also inspired by R&J - is one of my favourite retellings. I was also feeling positive because the author has a tendency to get very creative with her retellings. You can see the inspiration behind them, but her stories are usually very different from the original. I like that - who wants to read the same story again?No, the problem is that this world is so damn convoluted. The book tackles an ambitious premise - a completely new fantasy world with revenants, necromancers and a walled city surrounded by death. Literally. All of this tucked into the familiar tale of starcrossed lovers. And for the first half of the book, I honestly couldn't follow it. It was so confusing.The author's writing style is usually gorgeous - sensual even - but it is lost here among an overload of information. I'll try to explain the basic story as best as I can. It opens near the end of the traditional Romeo and Juliet story arc. In this world, \"the Juliet\" is a girl bespelled at birth to deliver justice by punishing any enemies of the Catresou clan. So when Romeo kills Tybalt, she is compelled to kill him in return. However, to avoid murdering her lover, she decides to make Romeo her \"Guardian\" - the one person who can control and command the Juliet - instead of Paris.\nThe Juliet was much, much more important to the Catresou than Paris ever would be. The spells laid upon her since birth let her sense anyone who had shed their clan's blood and compelled her to avenge it.\nUnfortunately, the magic of this ritual goes all wrong, Juliet ends up dead, and Paris ends up tied to Romeo instead. *deep breath* Elsewhere, Runajo really wants to protect her city and she attempts to join the Sisterhood in order to do so. Before she can do that, however, she must sit through the virgil of souls at the Mouth of Death - a trial where reapers and dead souls appear to her. One of these turns out to be the Juliet, and she's not quite as dead as she should be. When Runajo accidentally pulls her out, they are bound together.Still with me? Okay. So the main chunk of the story alternates between Romeo and Paris trying to find out what Tybalt and the Catresou clan are all caught up in, and Juliet and Runajo trying to figure out how to save Viyara. Phew. It was exhausting just trying to summarize the basic premise.On the plus side, this is not an angsty romance. It's not a romance at all beyond the few flashbacks to Romeo and Juliet's love affair. On the negative, it was genuinely quite dense and boring for the most part. There was no finesse to the world-building - it just seemed like a random hodgepodge of ideas shoved together to create a R&J retelling we haven't seen before. None of the characters interested me. Romeo is the same wet mop he always was, and Paris is even worse. The Juliet is a cold, unrelatable, distant character that I never warmed to, and Runajo is forgettable. Also confused why a clan as powerful as Catresou would choose to select one young girl to fight their enemies...Too much going on. Too many MCs and not enough characterization. I am so sad that I won't be adding another of Hodge's books to my favourites. I will say one thing in its favour, though: that last short chapter was exquisite. So beautiful and perfect - exactly what I would expect from this author.Blog | Facebook | Twitter | Instagram | Youtube | Store"}, {"userName": "Khanh, first of her name, mother of bunnies", "userReviewDate": "Sep 27, 2016", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/4527753-khanh-first-of-her-name-mother-of-bunnies", "userReview": "Sabriel, in case you haven't read it yet, was an awesome book. Romeo and Juliet, not so much. Still, I had high hopes, given that it's Rosamund Hodge...however, this book was a disappointment. Which is such a shame, because this book had necromancy and zombies. ZOMBIES!!!!!!! \nThe Ruining was more than the white fog that killed every person it touched. It had changed the nature of death. Even here in Viyara, behind the walls, the dead would rise again within two days, mindless and hungry for the living.\nThe setting was dark, dramatic, but it was just so freaking confusing. I still am not quite sure of the plot.This is what I think happens in the book. There's a world in which the dead rise as the living. There's some kind of a magical super powerful but cold and emotionless (because emotions = weakness, duh) protector of the people with hair like moonlight (I'm not kidding) who is \"The Juliet\" and her cousin Tybalt gets murdered. Paris is the guy sent to guard The Juliet and they're supposed to be bound together to protect everything, but The Juliet elopes with Romeo instead because...? Because. Paris is angry and pissed off and wants to prevent the binding between The Juliet and Romeo but consequently gets bound to Romeo instead. Awkward.Oh, and there's this random ass girl named Runajo who wants to do something in a magical library somewhere to defeat all the zombies.I think that's what happened. I'm not quite sure because it was all SO confusing. I would not compare this to Sabriel. I wouldn't call this a love story. It dragged on in a tremendously long, convoluted mess, and I did not care to finish this book."}, {"userName": "Wendy Darling", "userReviewDate": "Apr 09, 2014", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/2745288-wendy-darling", "userReview": "We hosted the official cover reveal for Rosamund Hodge's new book this morning:Look at the pretty!It's a dark romantic fantasy inspired by Romeo and Juliet...but with necromancers!Incidentally, if you're not a fan of R&J, note that the author says she thought it was dumb when she first read it as well, hah.

It was just so dull, boring, and everything was all over the place. It was just so bad that I actually dreaded the times where I had to force myself to pick up this book to try and get through it.When I read that this was going to be a Romeo and Juliet retelling, I was absolutely ecstatic. I've came across star-crossed lovers in a few YA books but never one that was dubbed as an R&J retelling. Naturally, I needed to get my hands on this book ASAP. So giving this a one star rating actually makes me feel really bad. I tend to not rate books that I DNF if I never made it to at least 50% but I feel like my opinion wouldn't have changed if I read 35% or even 100% of the book. In fact, I almost NEVER DNF books. You can go through my shelves and see for yourselves that I only have three books, including this one, that have be DNFed.No matter how bad a book is, I will push myself through and find just one thing that I enjoyed about that book and let that motivate me to continue on reading until the end. Unfortunately, the only good thing I can say about this book is the beautiful cover. And in truth, Rosamund Hodge is blessed with such beautiful covers! None of her covers could even be in the ballpark of ugly or \"meh\". The only other book by Rosamund Hodge I've read was Cruel Beauty and although it wasn't exactly a 5-star read for me, I still enjoyed the concepts and the characters of the story. My expectations weren't too high going into Bright Smoke, Cold Fire but I didn't expect it to be this bad for me to DNF.In all honesty, I went into this book expecting to read a romance because when you think Romeo and Juliet, you think something along the lines of forbidden romance and star-crossed lovers. But Romeo and Juliet weren't even really the main characters in the story? If anything they were just supporting characters to Paris and Runajo. On top of that, Paris and Runajo weren't even very likable. Especially not Runajo. Paris's chapters were bearable but I had to drag myself through Runajo's chapters because I really didn't like her right from the very beginning.Secondly, the whole storyline was just a big jumbled up mess. Rosamund Hodge tried to do so much all at once and it didn't make sense to me at all. Or at least it was so boring and info-dumpy that I didn't really care to even bother understanding the story anymore. It was like Pride and Prejudice and Zombies but more like Romeo and Juliet and the Undead because as far as I'm concerned, I don't think there were any zombies in the story. Juliet died but didn't really die but was brought back from the dead by Runajo so I guess that would make her undead so I'll just go with undead.I can't really say much about the story considering how I didn't even make it that far. I'm hoping to get back to this some other time so I can give it another chance, finish it, and then hopefully give a higher rating than just one star. I really want to enjoy a book written by Rosamund Hodge and I don't want to be doomed to never like a book that's been written by her. Her concepts have so much potential but there are just some things that don't really work for me. I have no doubt that Rosamund is a great author and that shows through her beautiful writing but it's just the executions that fall really flat for me. Hopefully, my second try at reading will be a better experience!"}, {"userName": "Stephanie (Bookfever. \u2665)", "userReviewDate": "Apr 28, 2014", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/4939266-stephanie-bookfever", "userReview": "Three stars might not seem like a very high rating for a Rosamund Hodge book from me considering I absolutely loved her previous books. I didn't hate Bright Smoke, Cold Fire but I can't help but feel slightly disappointed. It fell somewhere in the middle between good and bad for me.Starting the book I was very confused because the world in it, though it was pretty brilliant, was quite a lot to take in. And it took me a while (at least 40-50% in the book) to really got what was going on. And I was also pretty disappinted with the writing. It just didn't feel as amazing as in the other books like Cruel Beauty.The points of view were writting in Paris and Runajo's. I did like the friendship (not even sure I can call it that, maybe partnership?) that Paris formed with Romeo and Runajo with Juliet. I didn't care much for the chapters featuring Paris and Romeo. I just didn't like them as characters. I did, however, love Runajo and I eventually warmed up to Juliet also. Their connection and friendship (I'll just call it that) was pretty amazing as it grew.I do want to give the author points for the complex and dark world she has created in this book. It was also a very original reimagining of Romeo and Juliet. And I do want to find out what happens next of course, even though it was not as great as I thought it would be. It's still a good enough YA fantasy, in my opinion."}, {"userName": "Jen (The Starry-Eyed Revue)", "userReviewDate": "Apr 02, 2014", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/4659650-jen-the-starry-eyed-revue", "userReview": "An ARC of this title was provided by the publisher in exchange for an honest review. My thoughts are my own. This review can also be found at The Starry-Eyed Revue.Unlike a lot of people, Romeo & Juliet\u00a0has never been my favorite of Shakespeare's plays. (I go more for the brutal, cunning Macbeth.) I just don't get how overly romanticized R&J is when Romeo was infatuated with the fair Rosaline one day, only to find himself in love with Juliet the next. Fickle I may be at times, but that just rubbed me the wrong way. However, I am a Rosamund Hodge fangirl for life, and I will read anything and everything she writes.And now that I've read Bright Smoke, Cold Fire,\u00a0I'm not really sure what to do with myself. I've gotten so used to Hodge's stand-alone fantasies that it's rather shocking to be done with this book and not know how everything turns out. It's a planned duology, and I would very much like to have the next book in my hands now, but regardless of that fact, I'm still quite sure I loved this dark, bloody little novel. I absolutely love how Hodge turns the original tale of Romeo & Juliet on its head and basically makes me love her version better\u00a0than Shakespeare's.Gone are the romantic notions that Romeo and Juliet could end up happily ever after. This retelling opens on the eve of the end of Romeo and Juliet's tale and it's clear that this story is every bit the tragedy that the original play was. Especially since there are evil necromancers lurking in plain sight, wreaking their own brand of havoc while the city - the last in existence - is already plagued by revenants and reapers. And anyone who passes and is not burned upon death reawakens to become the living dead. Creepy. Imagine what this might mean, then, for our tortured lovers, if you will.That being said, this is not a zombie book. There are no walking dead, shambling about in search of brains. Not yet, anyway. There are those who are being reanimated to do the necromancers bidding, though, and that's bad enough. And this is where our key players come in, because at the heart of the story is each of their desire to save the city from itself.Romeo is still a besotted fool, but Paris has a much bigger role in this version. Rather than being Juliet's intended, he is her protector. Because Juliet is not just a girl. She is THE Juliet, a weapon in her own right. Even Rosaline has a starring role in this tale, though as the [mostly] unfeeling Runajo who will sacrifice herself in her determination to save Viyara. After a chain of events that none of them could have predicted, and on opposite sides of the city, these enemies from rival families form some rather reluctant alliances and it is exquisite.I found the world-building in this book to be rather intense but phenomenal, though it may be rather dense for some readers. Everyone trapped within the walls of the city for their own safety. The lower market. The underground library. Magic and blood and blood magic. All of it was so easy to imagine with Hodge's vivid descriptions. And I loved seeing the parallels to the original tale of woe while reading a completely different - albeit still lovely and tragic - story. Obviously, there was that whole ordeal with Romeo and Juliet, but then there are the warring families, the apothecary...the duel with Tybalt that leaves Romeo a wanted man. I loved every detail Hodge kept from the original story, and I loved them even more as they morphed into something evil and dark and altogether awful.Unlike her other novels, though, this one is not remotely romantic. Okay, maybe a teensy bit. In flashbacks. But I think the story is all the better for the absence of romance. At least in this first book. There's still so much for the characters to learn and understand, and a city to save, so it makes sense for any romance to take a backseat to the pivotal struggle at hand.Suffice it to say, I am\u00a0thoroughly impressed\u00a0with this novel. That's not surprising, though, considering how much I enjoyed her previous retellings.\u00a0I very much look forward to the conclusion to this Romeo & Juliet\u00a0retelling, especially as I wonder if the lovers will face the same fate as in the original tale...\n\nGIF it to me straight:"}, {"userName": "Cait \u2022 A Page with a View", "userReviewDate": "Mar 27, 2016", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/47412532-cait-a-page-with-a-view", "userReview": "I almost want to round my rating of 2.5 stars up to 3 because of the amazing worldbuilding.

This book was definitely not a quick/light read... like it took some serious effort to get through (both because I was a little bored and because of everything that was happening in the story). Her writing style in this one is really pretty, but also kind of... dense? I genuinely wanted to love this, and didn't necessarily dislike it, but I'm kind of underwhelmed right now.

Both will find that Viyara holds more secrets and dangers than anyone ever expected. And outside the walls, death is waiting. . . .What I Liked:I think I liked this book, but maybe there were just too many little things that I didn't love. I did think that it's an amazing and very creative retelling of Romeo and Juliet, but parts of the story were not to my liking. That being said, my somewhat low rating could be attributed to \"it's not you it's me\". You as a different reader might love this book!The Ruining has come over the world for a hundred years. There is no place left on the earth with living humans except the city of Viyara. Mahyanai Romeo and Juliet Catresou are part of two families at odds. Juliet is the sword of the Catresou family, and she is set to have a Guardian to help her. That Guardian would be Tybalt, her cousin. When Romeo kills Tybalt Catresou, Juliet is supposed to avenge her family and kill Romeo, but she can't - she and Romeo are hopelessly in love. Instead, they marry in secret and begin the process to make Romeo Juliet's Guardian. But this goes terribly wrong, and Romeo finds himself bound to Paris of the Catresou clan, and he thinks Juliet is dead. But Juliet is brought back from the dead by Runajo of the Mahyanai, who is a Sister of Thorn, sworn to protect Viyara. Runajo finds that having the sword of the Catresou family bound to her is not as advantageous as she expected. Both pairs - Paris and Romeo, Runajo and Juliet - will work together to uncover truths about the Ruining, necromancers, and the two families. And both pairs will find that death is closer than they think.I think the thing I really liked about this book was how incredibly unique it is, as a retelling of Romeo and Juliet. Hodge captures that original story, and then twists it up. You have a lovesick Romeo, who seems weak from love but truly is strong because of it. You have Juliet, who loves Romeo and dies for him, only to be brought back. There is Tybalt (though I'm still trying to figure out who Mercutio would be), and Runajo is actually Rosaline! But in this retelling, there are revenants and reapers and so much undead. I don't know what it is about the dead and undead that fascinates Hodge so much, but all of her stories seem to incorporate a lot of each. This book is NOT written from Romeo's POV, or Juliet's. Instead, it's written from Runajo and Paris's alternating third-person POVs. At first I was a little thrown by this because obviously I was expecting Romeo and Juliet's alternating POV (or at least one of their POVs). But I actually really liked that this book was not told from Romeo and Juliet's POVs. It's cool because the story is not really romance-driven, and it's not romance-centered. With Romeo and Juliet not as narrators, the story is less focused on the romance and more focused on the families and the undead and revenge. I thought Paris was okay, and Runajo was interesting. Both are interesting narrators to follow, though I didn't really *love* either of them. I thought Paris was kind of wimpy at times, and a bit mean to Romeo. Runajo is kickbutt and fearless, but I think those qualities alienated her and made her a little cold. She was tough as nails though, and very driven.I like the relationships in this book. Romeo and Juliet are very in love, and they stay that way from start to finish (despite pretty much never interacting throughout the entire book - they each think the other is dead). Paris is very devoted to Juliet (as her would-be Guardian) and the Catresou family (at first). But Paris and Romeo become friends, which is fun. There is also another character, Vai, that develops a good relationship with Paris. THAT was fun to read - Vai is hilarious! Runajo and Juliet's friendship took a long time to develop, and I'm still not sold on Runajo, but I think she eventually stops seeing Juliet as a weapon and a slave, and more of a human.I was never bored while reading this book, though I will say that I breezed through some of the longer passages that seemed to drag on and on. This happened... a lot. Still, the story was very intriguing and I couldn't stop reading. But in the end, I guess I felt a little meh.What I Did Not Like:I don't think I really connected with any of the characters. This could have been me, my preferences, my mood, I don't know. I didn't like Paris, I thought Runajo was okay but cold, and I feel like I really would have like Juliet but we never read from her perspective. Romeo was okay, and he grew on me towards the end of the story. But overall, none of the characters really called to me except Juliet, and maybe Vai. Vai is a fun character, but definitely meant to be more of a secondary character.This story is twisted and kind of cruel and heartbreaking. While I think the author did a great job of writing this (clearly, if the intent was to break hearts and make readers despair), I didn't necessarily love reading this book, as I was reading. I felt SO bad for Romeo, and Juliet, and it hurt seeing them apart, and seeing them believe that the other was dead. And then, since each of them was bounded to someone else (Juliet to Runajo, Paris to Romeo), their free will was kind of taken away. Paris could command Romeo, and Runajo could command Runajo. THIS was hard to read, as it always is for me to read, when it comes to free will taken away. I hate it when compulsion is a huge factor in books. Runajo could have told Juliet to walk off a cliff. And Runajo commands Juliet to do some things... I don't know, guys. I know this is all part of the story, but it hurt to read.I definitely wanted more explanation as to the Ruining, and why Viyara was the only city with living beings, and where all the revenants and such were coming from, and the necromancers too. Basically, the world-building was cool, and very dark and intense, but very little was explained. Of course, the author could be saving all of this juicy stuff for book two (I believe this is a duology). And she very briefly touches upon a potential explanation to one thing. But I wasn't really satisfied. I know I said that I liked that we never get Juliet and Romeo's POVs, but that doesn't mean that I liked that they NEVER interacted in this book. There are three (or maybe four?) scenes from the past that feature Romeo and Juliet, but they are short scenes, and there are only those three (or four) in the entire book. I wanted to see Romeo and Juliet interact, gravitate, fight for each other WITH each other. Instead, for the entire duration of the book, Juliet believes that Romeo died, and Romeo believes that Juliet died. This is still not cleared up at the end of the book, despite both of them surviving from their attempt at making Romeo Juliet's Guardian. Talk about frustrating!The story is slow. I'll be frank - I breezed through passages that didn't seem to add much to the story. Maybe they did (they probably didn't, in general), but there were a lot of paragraphs that seemed unnecessary. And the story barely moved at all, at first. It took me about, let's say one-third, of the story for me to really get into it, and even then, the story still moved somewhat slowly.The ending features a huge cliffhanger, and it's not the nicest ending. We still have separation of key characters, and ignorance too, and there is something shocking that probably can't be \"fixed\" in book two. The ending is pretty surprising, and I'm definitely interested in reading the next book. Would I Recommend It:Ehhhhh. This story was a very different retelling of Romeo and Juliet, I'll give it that. The female characters are SO fierce, and the undead aspect is wacky, and all the secrets are intriguing. But I don't think this is a must-read book. If anything, I'd wait to binge-read the series (I think it's a duology). Or skip altogether - I'm not getting life-changing vibes from the story.Rating:3.5 stars -> rounded down to 3 stars. I'm going to be slightly harsh with the rating simply because this just wasn't as great as I expected. The retelling aspects were really different and interesting, but little pieces of the story didn't fit well for me. It could be my mood! I just didn't find this story impressive. I really liked Cruel Beauty, but I didn't love Crimson Bound. This new book seems to be underwhelming, much like Crimson Bound was."}, {"userName": "Sarah", "userReviewDate": "May 13, 2016", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/7591340-sarah", "userReview": "(Source: I received a digital copy of this book for free on a read-to-review basis.

In spite of all the negative reviews I've seen, I still had this sliver of hope that no, it can't be true, it's Rosamund Hodge, she can't let you down Nastassja. Alas, she did. I don't know what to say about this book... the cover is beautiful? That is probably it. I can't say this book was a big cliche or that the characters annoyed me or the plot was stupid - none of these things are true. The truth is way more trivial: Everything felt lifeless and confusing, and not once the plot made me care to stop half-skipping the book and pay closer attention. It felt like this story took a little bit from every other story the author had written before. I wouldn't call this story unoriginal, but it might seem such if you have read anything written by Rosamund Hodge before. Magic system, feuding lovers, ancients and Gods, political intrigues. You might argue that there's plenty of other books with similar elements, but I am talking about the way Rosamund was using those elments in her previous books is very similar to the way she's using them in this one. As for Romeo and Juliet, well, I was never a fan of their story, but this book doesn't compliment their story of woe even barely. Romeo acts and talks like a total maroon, proclaiming he'll go and tell Juliet's killers everything he thinks about them and after he'll be ready to die from their swords. Like what? And Juliet acts like a killer machine programmed for one purpose: kill the enemies of her clan. And it is her role in the book to kill those enemies, and it was so strange and dull. Plus Romeo and Juliet not even the main characters of the story and they don't have POVs. I guess there's logic somewhere there, but I really didn't care to look for it, and Romeo and Juliet felt like those zombies this book was suppose to make us afraid of. Again, if only I cared! And for lovers of romance, don't expect any here. We only have snippets of Romeo and Juliet's original story but no real substance or real romantic relationship to root for. And the main characters - Runajo and Paris were so unremarkable, I don't even know what to say about them. They were nice? But dull? But what was their purpose in the book? Ah, I have no idea what the purpose of the whole book . Honestly, I felt like reading two different books, because our main characters never crossed paths, though, they had the same storyline, I didn't feel connection between them they way you feel it when you have two different characters set apart, and observe how their destinies lead them into each others directions and you can't wait for that epic reunion and emotions!! Here nothing of the sort happened. But maybe it's just me, unfeeling brat. Oh, there's also the author's nice writing style I always loved in her books. But who needs that when everything else is in ruin.There's going to be a sequel, but my interest is deadlier than the dead in this book.

Every wise man's son doth know.\"\nDo yourself a favor and only read the first chapter. Close the book. Make up your own ending. The first chapter of Bright Smoke, Cold Fire is everything it should have been. Juliet going into the catacombs to meet Romeo with rage in her heart. Vowing to kill him for murdering her cousin. Murderess Juliet? But after the prologue, it descends into your typical Hodge novel. It's becoming increasingly obvious that the author follows a formula. Retelling of something, check. No other countries because of a magical apocalypse in the past, check. World is ending, but no one else except the female protagonist knows it, check. Plot involves some kind of prophecy and clue-following, check.Combined with the writing, it makes for an incredibly dull read. I can't even pinpoint what's wrong with it. It's not bad, it just lacks spark. It's that decade-old manuscript at the bottom of the trunk you've outgrown, but don't want to admit all those years were for nothing, so you keep revising and revising: \"It doesn't matter if it's shit. Just as long as it's readable and grammatically correct. I just want this fucking done and out of my life.\"I can't make head or tails of the world-building. I know there are zombies and necromancers and a city wall that gets its strength from blood\u2014you know, pieces. But not the whole puzzle.For the sake of full disclosure, the narrative style is unique. Instead of being narrated by Romeo and Juliet, it's told through the POVs of Rosalie (called Runajo here) and Paris. Due to a bonding spell gone wrong at the beginning of the novel, instead of being tied to Romeo like Juliet wanted, she died and is bound to Runajo. Romeo is then bound to Paris because the latter interrupted the spell. We do get flashes of how Romeo and Juliet fell in love (which as cheesy and unrealistic as the original play), but the plot mainly focuses on Runajo trying to protect her city with Juliet's help while the boys attempt to track down Juliet. Yeah, I'm making it sound a lot more interesting than it really is.But who knows? Maybe others will enjoy it. It failed to capture my interest though.ARC provided by Edelweiss.

Pretty sure that 80% of the book was a variation of DEAD, DEATH, DIE, DIED with BLOOD somewhere in between. I lost count of the number of times I read those words in one page. On droned the protagonist: we\u2019re all already dead. We\u2019re all going to die. Death is everywhere. Death does not bargain. I\u2019m dead. You\u2019re dead. They\u2019re dead. Bloody death. Death and blood. There is no point in life. Let\u2019s just die. DIE, LOSERS, DIE!\nPUH-LEASE. Give me a flipping break.Rosamund Hodge\u2019s world building skills are excellent, Cruel Beauty and Crimson Bound are proof of that. Even in this, there was so much potential and countless fascinating concepts and ideas, all, I\u2019m sad to say, wasted. First off, there is an extreme confusion about the what, the how and the when. I\u2019ve read the whole book and have no clear notion as to what happened, be it the background or the plot. Especially the plot. I am a fan of no bullshit and straight answers so when the writers skirt around those and try to make it all intriguing and mysterious, well, sometimes it works \u2026 but this was not one of those times.I\u2019m having trouble pinpointing the source of the spiritless nature of the book. The best I can say is that underneath that breath-taking and gorgeous wrapping, there is nothing. It\u2019s a Romeo and Juliet retelling and the writer\u2019s spin on the characters and their circumstances is fun. At first. It starts going downhill and stops being amusing pretty fast. Ambiguity, confounding nature AND execution, incessant talk of death and awful characters. That is what killed Bright Smoke, Cold Fire.So the last of humanity now lives in Viyara after the Ruining, uh\u2026well, ruined the world and turned the people who came into contact with it Revenants (reminded me of Leonardo DiCaprio, LOL). Revenant is just a fancy word for medieval zombies which is what everybody becomes when they die even within the walls of Viyara. The walls are made from magic and blood. They are sustained by blood and sacrifice and they are dying. There is a covenant of women who takes care of that. There are also three major clans; Mahyanai, Catresou and Old Viyaran. I have no idea which clan believed in what or dismissed what ideas. Everyone had their own agendas, their own set of faiths, it got tangled up pretty bad.There are two things the four main characters have in common:A)\tOne or both of their parents are either dead or horrible.B)\tThey are pretty much useless.RUNAJO: Clan: MahyanaiProfession: Sister of Thorn Status: Dull, Suicidal, ObnoxiousROMEO:Clan: MahyanaiProfession: I\u2019m not sure. Lovesick idiot?Status: Pathetic, Uninteresting, Stupid JULIET or THE JULIET:Clan: CatresouProfession: Assassin of the Catresou born to avenge her clanStatus: Plain WEIRD.PARIS: Clan: CatresouProfession: Trained (poorly) to become La Juliet\u2019s guardianStatus: The biggest loser of them all.I meant what I said, they ARE completely annoying and infinitely useless. Runajo just talks and talks and TALKS of death, Juliet glares and stares and makes idle threats, Romeo cries ALL THE TIME and Paris humiliates himself constantly. There is no depth (although the book tries) and the characters are one-dimensional. The only one I really liked was Vai and he turned out to be a woman. Funny how that keeps happening in books. Did I think this was completely unexpected and lame or did I take in a stride? I am not even sure. Romeo and Juliet\u2019s iconic love was not iconic at all.Three stars because this is from the author of the two books I loved and because I\u2019m feeling generous.

But first, let's talk about the plot, and boy it's a doozy: Romeo and Juliet live in a city where zombies roam the perimeter. There is a force field protecting the walls, but it's failing for some reason. Two other characters, Paris and Runajo, are working against the clock to solve the walking dead problem, eventually teaming up with Romeo and Juliet when the lovers aren't too busy sucking on each other's faces while the world is collapsing around them.Oddly enough, I would have expected the zombie part of the novel to suck, but it doesn't. In fact, it's downright exciting!\u00a0Hodge writes as though the characters are fighting against a fate that they cannot hope to win against, and this Sisyphean struggle ups the dramatic tension considerably. Even though there are a few hiccups (i.e., an anticlimactic battle scene, characters making eye-roll-worthy\u00a0mistakes, inadequate explanation of the magic system), for the most part the whole story about revenants and necromancers is tight and well-paced with plenty of neck-breaking and wrist-slashing to satisfy even the most hardcore adventure fan. True, it starts off fairly slow, but as the stakes pile up and the threat of the looming dead grow even stronger, it becomes difficult not to turn the pages. As far as the zombies are involved, this book is a clear winner:The Ruining was more than the white fog that killed every person it touched. It had changed the nature of death. Even here in Viyara, behind the walls, the dead would rise again within two days, mindless and hungry for the living. And so the bodies had to be cremated first; the furnaces of the Sisters never cooled.But then we get to the love story between good ol' R and J. And that, my friends, is a stinker.Romance novelists usually follow a specific formula that fans have come to expect. It's tried-and-tested throughout the ages, and deviating from it is a bad idea. Here's the pattern:1. Boy meets girl2. Boy proves himself worthy3. Girl accepts\u00a0boyNumber two is the most crucial step. You can relegate number one off-page, but if you skip number two, number three will turn into the cliche known as insta-love. Unfortunately, Hodge mumbles something about number one then dives straight to number three, pouring on the till-death-do-us-part thick and heavy. However, without a number two to ground it, it's nothing but smoke and mirrors. All we are told\u00a0is that Romeo and Juliet are in love. How? When? Where? Why? Who cares, just get with the program! Every page is absolutely dripping in sweet, syrupy, and downright sappy romantic lines such as:She was as lovely as rumor said: skin like moonlight, hair like midnight, eyes as blue as the twilight sky.or how about this one from Lord Byron Junior himself:He stares out over the city as he says dreamily: \u201c The moon is alone, and so am I; My sleeves are wet with tears.\u201d\u201cI don\u2019t know that one,\u201d she says.\u201cIt does not yet exist,\u201d he says, turning to her, \u201cbut I will write it for you. Let me write you a thousand and eight poems, one for every morning I wake up beside you. Let me cover the whole world in words, and drown in oceans of ink.\u201dShe cannot help laughing, though her heart is breaking. She knows what he is asking. She knows the answer.\u201cMy father will never set my hand in yours,\u201d she says.She has never had to tell him, I will not desert my people. It is part of why she loves him.But wait! If you call 1-800-SAVEME right now, we'll give you even more for free:He knows what she is thinking. He takes her hands, and oh, his smile has all the spark and gleam that she has loved since she met him. \u201cLady of loveliness surpassing all the stars,\u201d he says, \u201cstar of the night that until you requite me will darken my heart, and heart that moves the blood in my breast\u2014 will you take pity on a pilgrim, and marry him?\u201dShe laughs, and kisses him in reply.Seriously,\u00a0who talks like that? No one. Not even Tennyson on his best days. This kind of language works well on stage because plays are primarily an aural medium, which means the actors are allowed to use all the flowery speech they want (it's expected, even) and can compensate with body language, but it crashes and burns when used in a novel. Hodge commits, in my opinion, the cardinal sin of writing dialogue: no subtext. Everything is laid out in the open. Romeo really means what he says. It would have been much better if he threw a slushball at\u00a0Juliet's head and yelled, \"Hey! Fatty! Tell Tybalt I said 'Hi'\" with a sly wink and a flying kiss.Okay, maybe that's not the best alternative, but you get my point.There's also a crucial mistake early on (although not entirely Hodge's fault since she's only following the source material). In the first chapter, we learn that Romeo had been courting the character Runajo and had tried to\u00a0elope with her. Then he swoons for Juliet and everything else is forgotten. This leaves a horrible question in the eyes of the reader: if he changed his mind about the first woman, then how do we know he won't change his mind about Juliet? In fact, this is mentioned several times in the book by other people:\u201cHe was begging me to run away with him three months ago,\u201d she said. \u201cWhatever happened between you two, it wasn\u2019t\u2014\u201d\u201cIt was real.\u201d Juliet\u2019s voice was unyielding. \u201cIt was swift and it was foolish, but it was real.\u201dReally? How do we know that?In the end, I'm glad R and J weren't the main characters. Paris and Runajo were more sensible and complicated than either of them, and as long as the story focused on chasing zombies, I was hooked. Every time it deviated to snogging necks, I wanted to skip that chapter entirely. By far my favorite character was a guy named Vai. You'll know why I liked him when you come to a specific part in the book.I began\u00a0this review by saying that Hodge skipped number two (boy proves himself worthy) of the classic romantic formula. Well, that's not exactly true. She finally reveals how Romeo won Juliet's heart in a beautiful flashback when the novel is about to end. When I read it, everything suddenly clicked into place. The sappy lines now had a foundation and became more tolerable. I started to appreciate the bond of love between them both. Romeo and Juliet became living people and not cardboard cutouts of Bella Swan and Edward Cullen.Although I could see the reasons why Hodge would try to withhold the courtship from the reader for dramatic purposes, it wasn't worth it.\u00a0The last chapter should have been the first.

This is one Juliet not to be trifled with.There were some parts that felt a little slow, but the action, suspense, and dash of humor totally made up for it.

I loved Cruel Beauty and Crimson Bound so much that this book was one of my most anticipated releases of 2016 and I made it my mission to get a copy as soon as possible. I was so excited for her newest retelling, this time Romeo and Juliet. She has done such an incredible job in the past with her standalone retellings! Her creative take on each story is amazing and I was totally expecting to be blown away by this one too. Instead I came away underwhelmed.This extremely unique retelling is so complex, there is no way I could possibly explain it but I'll try to summarize a bit. The story is set in a fantasy world where the Ruining has taken over the world and revenants and reapers (basically zombies) roam everywhere except within the city of Viyara. This city is protected by blood magic that is maintained by the Sisters of Thorn, of which Runajo is a part. It is her mission to find a way to save the city and perhaps the world from the Ruining. Within the city there are two main families, the Mahyanai and the Catresou. The Juliet is the sword of the Catresou, meant to avenge them, and Paris is her guardian. Both Romeo and Runajo are Mahyanai. There is a ton of blood magic and other magic and religion and necromancers and gangs and zombies and murder and whew! this story is complicated. Bright Smoke, Cold Fire is definitely not a light read. That entire paragraph is my main issue with this book. I knew going in that this would not be a typical retelling and that it might require me to think a little more than your average YA book. After all, that is why I love Rosamund Hodge so much! But this story was just too much. It is an interesting premise but for whatever reason it just didn't all mesh together quite like it should have. I was really sure who all of the secondary characters were and there were several times when I found myself totally lost and having to reread pages. I also felt like the story just kind of meandered along most of the time. Even when things happened that should have been shocking, the reaction was more of, \"Oh, okay,\" than, \"Holy crap what just happened!\"All of that being said, there were things I did like about Bright Smoke, Cold Fire. The story is not told from the points of view of Romeo and Juliet. Instead, their companions tell the story, which I really enjoyed. Romeo was way too sentimental and whiney even for me, with his constant woe is me and wanting to literally lay down and die of heartbreak. I didn't quite care for Paris either, to be honest. My favorite characters in this book were Runajo and Juliet. I loved the bond they shared and the struggles they faced, especially Runajo. Shockingly, there is very little romance in this retelling, but I think there may be more of that in future books in the series. I did find the magic and religion aspects of the story interesting to the extent that they were explained and I understood them. The world building was incredible, even if it was way too much for me. There was a definite creepy atmosphere and the book does paint a picture that's easy to see while reading this. Still, I feel like Rosamund Hodge almost created a world that is too detailed and needs a companion encyclopedia or something.Overall, this was an interesting story that was just too convoluted to truly enjoy. After thinking about this book for a few days, I can definitely say I want to continue the series now that I've spent so much time trying to figure out what's going on. Bright Smoke, Cold Fire definitely wasn't the work of art I expected from Rosamund Hodge, but it was still enough that I feel invested in the story and will read the next one."}, {"userName": "Aila", "userReviewDate": "Apr 22, 2015", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/25674512-aila", "userReview": "As always, Hodge writes a spellbinding setting filled with dark secrets and cunning characters- one where death is a plague upon the city of Viyara.
