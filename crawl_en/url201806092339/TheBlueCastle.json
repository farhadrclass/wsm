Montgomery party, not having grown up with her stories as a young girl, but rather read them for the first time in my late 20's. Knowing what I know now about the beauty and magic of her books, I realize I missed out of some major reading adventures with Anne, Emily, Pat and gang, and will consequently never be able to wax nostalgic about how those books effected my life (which is probably for the best, as I tend to go into sappy, melodramatic overdrive when I really love a book - you know it's true, my GR friends) :PBut in the case of The Blue Castle, it's a good thing I didn't pick this up to read until I was about the age of Valency, because I don't think a younger girl would be able to fully appreciate this story as much a young woman who has lived a little. This is one of Montgomery's only books written with an adult audience in mind, and it wasn't highly acclaimed at the time of publication or for several decades afterwards. It definitely deals with more adult themes, and does so with a very sympathetic hand. I have since learned more about Montgomery's less-then-fairytale life, and it makes me appreciate her talents even more.If Jane Austen's Persuasion is all about second chances in life, then Montgomery's The Blue Castle is all about allowing oneself to have a chance at all. Valancy's road to independence at the age of 29 is chock-full of convenient coincidences that happen in order for her (and the story) to blossom, but those plot contrivances thankfully don't lessen the appeal of the story. While the majority of the characters are one dimensional and make only a brief appearance, Montgomery perfectly captured the character of Valancy, her mother, Roaring Abel, Cissie, and Barney Snaith. And speaking of Barney Snaith, was there EVER a swoon-worthy hero with a more dumpy name in the history of fiction? Good grief, the man oozes sex appeal, but no reader ever brings him up in discussions of great fictional heros, and I am convinced it's because of his name. Think about it:Gone with the Wind: Barney Butler....Pride and Prejudice: Barney Darcy....Twilight: Barney Cullen....I rest my case."}, {"userName": "Tadiana \u2729Night Owl\u263d", "userReviewDate": "Mar 26, 2014", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/8734459-tadiana-night-owl", "userReview": "If you think your relatives argue too much over Sunday dinner or are just impossible to live withtry Valancy Stirling's family. Written in 1926 by the author of the beloved Anne of Green Gables series, this is the story of Valancy, a 29 year old timid mouse of a person, considered an old maid by her family and the town generally. She does what everyone asks even when she hates it, quails before her insolent relatives, never talks back (except in her own mind), cries herself to sleep on a regular basis, and overall lives a thoroughly miserable life. Her only solace is the imaginary Blue Castle she lives in when she daydreams, and the poetic nature books of John Foster, which speak to her heart. One day Valancy, without telling her family, sneaks off to the doctor to find out why her heart has been bothering her. The doctor examines her, but rushes off in an emergency before he can give her a diagnosis. The letter she gets a day or two later from the doctor informs her that she has a severe heart condition, and less than a year to live.Oddly enough, this death sentence frees Valancy from her miserable existence. With nothing to lose, she starts sassing her ice-cold mother and relatives, begins wearing \"unsuitable\" clothing, moves out of the family home, and generally starts doing what she wants to without a thought for propriety. It's lovely to see her bloom and gain confidence, and begin to seek out happiness and love on her own terms. And eventually (I won't spoil the story by going into the hows and whys) she finds a home in a cottage by the lake that reminds her of her beloved Blue Castle.This really is an old-fashioned, romantic \"wish fulfillment\" type of tale, and you have to just appreciate it for what it is. A few things kind of bothered me: You have to wade through a fair amount of misery in the beginning of the book before Valancy decides to grow a spine (I recommended this book to my mother, and she texted me for two days whining about the first part and asking me if I was certain she was going to like this book). The plot is pretty transparent: there are a couple of . . . developments (I can't really call them twists) that I could see coming from the very beginning of the book. But the lyrical, loving descriptions of the beauties of nature, a sweet romance and the witty humor touched my heart and won me over. Forget whatever shortcomings there are and just enjoy the ride.If you like Anne of Green Gables and other old-fashioned books, you'll probably love this one. And you might pick up a few handy insults to use with your relatives when they get insufferable. 4.5 stars."}, {"userName": "Kate", "userReviewDate": "May 23, 2007", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/94075-kate", "userReview": "An independent story from the author of Anne of Green Gables, written for an older audience. An important and underrated part of the Montgomery collection -- in this story, a young woman (young by our standards, an old maid in her time) rebels against her oppressive family and a conservative society to achieve a few basic but essential moments of happiness. On the surface this may look like flowers and fluff but, for the time, this was a subversively pre-feminist novel. Valancy becomes psychologically and sexually independent, finds her own voice and claims a corner of the world (and its scruffy male inhabitant) for herself. This book had a big impact on me in college, and is still important as realistic fantasy for women living in strict conservative societies (patriarchal Japan, for example). Montgomery's work is constantly under-estimated, and the way the books are marketed doesn't help (the flowery script, the swoony illustrations). There are many layers at work in her stories, and some pioneering feminist concepts tucked in between the deep appreciation of nature, the commentary on the stuffy contemporary society of her day, and the delightful, well-drawn characters."}, {"userName": "Rowena", "userReviewDate": "Sep 07, 2016", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/2990642-rowena", "userReview": "\"Valancy had lived spiritually in the Blue Castle ever since she could remember. She had been a very tiny child when she found herself possessed of it. Always, when she shut her eyes, she could see it plainly, with its turrets and banners on the pine-clad mountain height, wrapped in its faint, blue loveliness, against the sunset skies of a fair and unknown land. Everything wonderful and beautiful was in that castle. Jewels that queens might have worn; robes of moonlight and fire; couches of roses and gold; long flights of shallow marble steps, with great, white urns, and with slender, mist-clad maidens going up and down them; courts, marble-pillared, where shimmering fountains fell and nightingales sang among the myrtles; halls of mirrors that reflected only handsome knights and lovely women--herself the loveliest of all, for whose glance men died. All that supported her through the boredom of her days was the hope of going on a dream spree at night. Most, if not all, of the Stirlings would have died of horror if they had known half the things Valancy did in her Blue Castle.\"- Lucy Maud Montgomery, The Blue CastleThis is the sort of book that makes me so glad to be a reader. Montgomery is an EXTREMELY talented and beautiful writer. Recently I've been finding myself wanting to read more of her work because it's honestly like a balm. There's a feeling I would get very often as a child when I was discovering the world of literature and everything was fresh and new; it's a feeling that as an adult I rarely get close to reliving, but in this book I did see some glimmers of it.I'd never read any Montgomery books outside of the Anne series and anyone who's read those books knows how special they are. This story took me back to my preteens in Africa when I was first introduced to Anne by my aunt who then lived in the Maritimes (Nova Scotia). Now that Canada is my home, and because I've visited Prince Edward Island, Montgomery's beloved home, I have to say I feel even more attached to Montgomery now, knowing first-hand where she got much of her inspiration from. This is the story of 29-year-old spinster, Valancy Stirling, the old-fashioned and archaic word for single woman being used because those were conservative times where a woman who was single after a certain age was considered to be a loser. As the book said, \"She was twenty-nine, lonely, undesired, ill-favoured--the only homely girl in a handsome clan, with no past and no future.\" Our heroine is single, miserable, and part of a large clan where she sees herself as invisible, has a lot of fear, has no friends, and has never really known happiness in her life. In her sad existence, all she has is her blue castle: her imagination. A pivotal experience in her life (no spoilers), however, changes her life forever.I loved the new Valancy; I fully support women who have thrown off their shackles, decided enough is enough, and have decided to live authentically. Recently I've been reading a lot of feminist texts that have reminded me what this empowerment means and just how important it is. Rereading Audre Lorde and rediscovering her famous quote, \"My silences had not protected me. Your silence will not protect you\", made me think of how apt it was in Valancy's case, and how life-giving it is when we realize that we can totally be free:\"'I've been trying to please other people all my life and failed,' she said. 'After this I shall please myself. I shall never pretend anything again. I've breathed an atmosphere of fibs and pretences and evasions all my life. What a luxury it will be to tell the truth! I may not be able to do much that I want to do but I won't do another thing that I don't want to do. Mother can pout for weeks--I shan't worry over it. 'Despair is a free man--hope is a slave'\" The freedom and life that Valancy experiences after the big turning point in her life warmed my heart. And it made me laugh to read how Valancy's relatives thought she had gone mad because of course free-thinking women have clearly lost it.What I also adored about this book was Montgomery's veneration of nature. Although the book is set near Muskoka, Ontario, Montgomery got her nature-writing muse from PEI which is, in my humble opinion, one of the most beautiful places in Canada. Montgomery's descriptions of nature makes you want to be in it:\u201c...the woods, when they give at all, give unstintedly, and hold nothing back from their true worshippers. We must go to them lovingly, humbly, patiently, watchfully, and we shall learn what poignant loveliness lurks in the wild places and silent intervales, lying under starshine and sunset, what cadences of unearthly music are harped on aged pine boughs or crooned in copses of fir, what delicate savours exhale from mosses and ferns in sunny corners or on damp brooklands, what dreams and myths and legends of an older time haunt them. Then the immortal heart of the woods will beat against ours and its subtle life will steal into our veins and make us its own forever, so that no matter where we go or how widely we wander we shall yet be drawn back to the forest to find our most enduring kinship.\u201dHighly recommended! One of my favourite reads of the year <3"}, {"userName": " Danielle The Book Huntress (Back to the Books)", "userReviewDate": "Dec 30, 2008", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/1570669-danielle-the-book-huntress-back-to-the-books", "userReview": "What a delightful book! Who could not love this story about a woman who gains the courage to break free from the smothering yoke of her family and to make the most of the life she has left?This book was hilariously funny in some parts, always inspirational, and sometimes pretty sad. It was intensely readable, and I loved Valancy and Barney. I could empathize very deeply with Valancy's situation, and I cheered her on when she stopped being afraid, and decided to be true to herself. Life is too short to be hemmed and caged by others' expectations. If you can't be happy with who you are, then what is the point of living? It took a life-changing event to get Valancy to see this, and I was glad she did.The romance was lovely in this book. I liked how Valancy and Barney's relationship started and would always be built on their friendship. There was a deep, romantic love there, no doubt. But, the person that one chooses as their life partner needs to be one that they can be happy to be around, and comfortable enough to not feel the need to fill the silences, but to cherish them. They found a connection as soulmates through the doorway of respect for each other and friendship. A great way to start a great lifetime love, in my opinion.The metaphor of the blue castle spoke to me. We all need a blue castle in our lives, a place where we can go to feel true happiness, a retreat away from the disappointments and expectations of the world, and others' judgments and requirements for us. As I read this book, I wondered where my blue castle was. I got the answer to that question, and it made me smile. This book gave me some wonderful hours of entertainment, but also encouraged me to life my life to its fullest. In the end, the quiet, shy, plain Valancy is a huge role model to readers who find themselves in a similar situation to hers. This is my first book by L.M. Montgomery, and I'm eager to read more of her."}, {"userName": "Crystal", "userReviewDate": "Jul 10, 2007", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/182835-crystal", "userReview": "This is my favorite novel by LM Montgomery, even though it's not necessarily typical of her books. It is the sweetest romance I have ever read, full of laugh out loud moments and obnoxious \"villains\". In fact, this book's annoying characters are on a par with Jane Austen's best. it's a great story of learning to be free of society's bonds and expectations, of finding love when and where least expected, and of the joys that come when you open your heart to them.

If all you know of L. M. Montgomery is her Anne of Green Gables series, then I highly suggest picking up a copy of this lesser known classic.Valancy Stirling is 29 and can't forget for a moment that she's unmarried and undesired. If her inadequacies did slip her mind, her \"loving\" family would be quick to remind her. Her whole life, she's lived under the thumb of the Stirling clan, bound to their ideals of how she should think, act, and feel. She's smothered, but not loved. Controlled, but not wanted. Her only refuge is the Blue Castle, a mythical place she's created in her imagination.Then she is given an unusual gift: a doctor tells her she has less than a year to live. With no more reason to fear the future, Valancy is able to start enjoying the present. Against her family's objections, she moves out and takes on a job and gets to know Barney Snaith, the mysterious man in town her family spreads scandalous rumors about. For a short time she's happy, and it looks like she's found her Blue Castle after all. She knows it can't last-- she's dying, after all-- but then things take a turn she never expected.This book is the contemporary romance of its day (1926) and is infused the wit, biting social commentary, and charm. The Stirling family is so obnoxious and so amusing at the same time.

It reminds me of The Ladies of Missalonghi by Colleen McCullough. I wonder if McCullough meant her book as a sort of tribute to Montgomery?There's a quite a bit in The Blue Castle that is early feminism. A young woman under constant criticism for not getting a husband and shackled to a narrow existence at home by family disapproval of female independence, breaks free of convention in the pursuit of happiness. I remember my grandmother telling me that in the late 1930s her family considered her an old maid because she was still single at twenty-four. There was no thought in her parent's heads that she might like to strike out on her own; it was unthinkable that a well brought up girl would do such a thing. The Blue Castle perfectly portrays the cultural and family disapproval young women of the time faced when they went against social norms. Montgomery presents the ideas that thinking for yourself, choosing your own destiny and living life on your own terms are not improper, selfish, and undutiful, but perfectly normal and healthy. Valancy Stirling does nothing immoral or unchristian, yet she is punished as though she's been dancing the can-can in the street without underpants. Love and approval can be weaponized if you withhold them from your children; doing so is cruel and manipulative and should be beneath any decent parent. Sadly, I know many people who have experienced a manipulative, selfish mother like Mrs Stirling, a nasty woman who thinks nothing of using this ugly method to control her child. It angers me to know that many young women today are still up against the same obstacles that this book from the late 1920s portrays. Altogether very entertaining and informative without being preachy or sappy."}, {"userName": "Nenia \u2728 Queen of Literary Trash, Protector of Out-of-Print Gems, Khaleesi of Bodice Rippers, Mother of Smut, the Unrepentant, Breaker of Convention \u2728 Campbell", "userReviewDate": "Dec 03, 2017", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/2190064-nenia-queen-of-literary-trash-protector-of-out-of-print-gems-khalees", "userReview": "Instagram || Twitter || Facebook || Amazon || Pinterest\ud83c\udf1f I read this for the Yule Bingo Challenge, for the category of Malfoy: Character you love to hate. For more info on this challenge, click here. \ud83c\udf1fOh man, this was just the palate cleanser I needed after all those crazy bodice ripper romances. L.M. Montgomery, author of ANNE OF GREEN GABLES fame, brings to the table something wickedly funny and wholesomely real with THE BLUE CASTLE: a story of a bitterly unhappy girl who learns to discover her true self in the face of a terrible tragedy.The plot actually reminded me of the 2006 film, Last Holiday, starring Queen Latifah, and I couldn't help but wonder if Last Holiday was in some part inspired by THE BLUE CASTLE. THE BLUE CASTLE is about a girl named Valancy who lives with a bitter and miserable family, mired in tradition and utterly consumed with ritual and what's \"proper.\"Valancy is kept under their thumb, abused, and mocked for being a twenty-nine-year-old spinster, but her unhappiness is also the glue that not only keeps her family united, but also rationalizes their own self-misery and unhappiness. It's an utterly toxic atmosphere, and it's no wonder that Valancy suffers anxiety attacks and depression, and cries herself to sleep at night as she reminisces over past injustices while also hoping for something more. Her two spots of solace in the world are books by an author named John Foster, who writes beautiful prose on the Canadian wilderness, and a fantasyland of her own imaginings: Blue Castle, where everything is beautiful and goes according to her wishes.One day, Valancy visits a doctor about one of her \"spells\" and finds out that she has a fatal heart defect, and only has a year to live. She decides that she doesn't want to spend that last year miserable, and begins telling off her awful relatives and living a scandalous but thoroughly happy life that leaves her relatives reeling, and also, of course, bitterly envious of her daring and contentment.This was a really great story. Is it realistic? No. But it has an emotional depth that is somewhat lacking in the earlier Anne novels - perhaps because this book is intended for an older audience. Valancy's depression is depicted with gritty realism, and I felt utterly sorry for her in the beginning. I also liked her sarcasm and bitter wit - she's not at all like Anne; she's much more sarcastic and cynical, and her repartee with her awful relatives cracked me up. That cynicism, in many ways, reminded me of the terrible family in COLD COMFORT FARM. I think THE BLUE CASTLE is written for a much more cynical audience who, like Valancy, hasn't quite given up hope...If you're a fan of clean and older romances, you should definitely pick up THE BLUE CASTLE. It's only 99-cents right now, and the realness of it, as well as the charming and slow burn romance, were exactly what I needed to get me through this cold and chilly Sunday. Be prepared to laugh, and enjoy some of the most beautiful descriptions of nature you've ever seen.

What are the things that you would like to do before you kick the bucket? \"Live\" for one thing and that is exactly what Valancy Sterling has in mind. She wants to live her life before death claims her. Trying to be a prim and proper lady her whole life, Valancy Sterling has had enough. She has wasted too many years living to please others who were always disappointed in her but she has decided from now on she will speak her mind whenever she wants and she will sneeze where ever she wants. But that's not all, she is going to live in the same house with a old local drunk and take care of his sick dying daughter. But the bucket list is not complete without getting married and who better to get married to than the town's most notorious character. Living life takes a new meaning in the case of Valency Sterling. Whoever thought a death sentence would be this much fun. Written with beautiful and imaginative voice the character of Valency has the ability to make you empathize with her and bring out that small part of you that recognizes the unpredictability and shortness of life.

That first big step of hers was rather poignant. You know, like when we start helping others, we forget about all our woes? In any case, I ended up liking Valancy and adoring her story quite well. The romance... *sigh* It was different and intriguing and fae and utterly sweet. I liked a lot of things about this love story. So much fun. And so beautiful. All clean. But I would still recommend older teens to adult. It just more written for that age I think. Our main character is almost thirty, after all. Some things I didn\u2019t like about The Blue Castle. One: a phrase here or there almost seemed mocking of Christianity or the idea of God. I wish L.M. Montgomery would have expounded more on her characters\u2019 faith. Such an elusive element of faith leaves me feeling befuddled and rather concerned at points. I will say though, once Valancy is more settling down, it does mention that she found a nice, country church, and liked it. Two: Valancy was rude and a bit arrogant at certain parts. It was a crucial part of her story, but her sassy, indifferent attitude didn\u2019t impress me at all. Flinging her relatives\u2019 not-so-perfect looks in their faces especially wasn\u2019t a nice thing to do\u2026 since she didn\u2019t like when they did that to her! But that actually worked out pretty nicely too. I think I was satisfied for the most part as the story progressed. There was probably a few other things here and there that made me pause. Little comments or happenings that were a bit distasteful. But all in all, I had to sigh at the end. It was such a lovely tale in conclusion. The \u201cold\u201d spinster. The nature books she loves. The heart problems. The fantastical blue castle. The mysterious man. The Blue Castle said \u201cWake up!\u201d Live zealously! You only have one life. Make it count! To a certain extent, take control of your destiny. Don\u2019t let other people\u2019s expectations or society\u2019s opinion of you dictate how you feel. LIVE! Love. Care. Smile. And who knows, romance and blue castles might be waiting around the bend\u2026 :-)"}, {"userName": "Eve", "userReviewDate": "Aug 01, 2017", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/1283951-eve", "userReview": "If a book could be a sumptuous feast, this would be one fit for a king.

Not allowed to have opinions or have any say about anything including her wardrobe or reading material. Ugh! She's a 29 year old woman!

Sweet though not maudlin, a bit unreliable at times, clich\u00e9d even but somewhat really well worked for me. Valancy Stirling, almost thirty-years-old, today we would say independent and self-aware young woman but a hundred years ago she was perceived as an old spinster, and actually neither independent nor self-aware. When we meet her on her birthday Valancy strikes us mostly as unhappy, kept down by family poor thing.Though I was in my teens when I read  The Blue Castle  for the first time I could easily identify with her, I understood her concerns and anxieties. Valancy is a sensitive and perceptive person, endowed with a great sense of humor and ready tongue although in the eyes of her hellish family, prying aunts, overbearing mother, pompous uncles and snobbish cousin, she is considered as a misfit, loser and deadly bore. One day by unlucky or lucky coincidence, having taken information about the state of her health, Valancy stakes everything on one card. She gives up all her past life, her empty days and barren existence, her status of dutiful daughter and eternal people-pleaser to live, truly live and finally experience life. Oh, that joy when you can allow yourself to do what you please,  the luxury of speaking one's mind.And so Valancy sets out for her dreamed Blue Castle. I think that each of us nurtures in our hearts the image of our own safe place, the quiet haven, the dreamed secret garden, the place where we can shelter when life is just too much for us.

Montgomery! Even more so than Jane of Lantern Hill. More Heartwrenching and beautiful then any of her others. It will take me some time to sort my thoughts out on this one.\nValancy has had about enough of her family's nit-picking, if they remind her one more time about her being an unwanted old maid, she feels that she will burst. Then Valancy finds that her heart is not only having strange jumpy spells, but is leaving her crippled with pain at times. So, she rebels against her family's tradition of only going to Dr. _, and instead goes to Dr. Trent, without telling a soul. \u201cRebellion flamed up in her soul as the dark hours passed by \u2013 not because she had no future but because she had no past.\u201d The news she hears is not encouraging, but it gives her a sudden and much needed will to live her own life, not that of her family.She takes them all by storm, they don't know what's hit them. Where has dull, submissive, plain Valancy gone? And who is this shocking, outspoken almost pretty girl? She must be crazy they decide, there is no other reason why she would treat them in this atrocious manner! For the first time in her life Valancy feels free, she says what she wants, (most of the time), works for Roaring Able and she helps his daughter Cissy, the towns shunned fallen woman. While doing that she meets Barney, a man everyone says is an ex convict. She falls head over heels for him, without him ever knowing. But that doesn't matter, because for the first time in her life, Valancy is blissfully happy. So, so beautiful! Everyone should read this. At first I didn't think I'd like Valancy, I thought it was going to be a \"pity me\" kind of book. How wrong I was! By the time i turnee theast page I loved her! The only thing I didn't care for is\u2026 Barney - what a terrible name! He was amazing as a character though. That's my only complaint, and as L.M.

Valancy has become a nonentity within her own family, alternately bullied and overlooked. Until, that is, she learns she has only a short time to live. At which point, hidden Valancy emerges, much to the discomfiture of her mother.By this time they had reached Maple Avenue and Uncle Herbert's house, a large, pretentious structure peppered with meaningless bay windows and excrescent porches. A house that always looked like a stupid, prosperous, self-satisfied man with warts on his face.\"A house like that,\" said Valancy solemnly, \"is a blasphemy.\"Mrs. Frederick was shaken to her soul. What had Valancy said? Was it profane? Or only just queer? Mrs. Frederick took off her hat in Aunt Alberta's spare-room with trembling hands. She made one more feeble attempt to avert disaster. She held Valancy back on the landing as Cousin Stickles went downstairs.\"Won't you try to remember you're a lady?\" she pleaded.\"Oh, if there were only any hope of being able to forget it!\" said Valancy wearily.Mrs. Frederick felt that she had not deserved this from Providence.To her family's uncomprehending horror, Valancy not only leaves home, but takes a job and - SHOCKER - appears to be completely happy. L.M. Montgomery has great fun with this first part of the book (I do love me a good worm that turns) and the shades of pomposity, hypocritical thinking and envy shown by Valancy's family are beautifully & entertainingly done. The second half of the book takes a slightly more dramatic turn (cue \"hidden\" identities, and \"surprising\" discoveries), as Valancy negotiates a delightful relationship with laid-back Barney Snaith. In spite of the mawkish sentimentality that's overlaid most of the adaptations of Anne of Green Gables, it's worth remembering that LMM is a solidly good writer: her heroines are \"real\" (not idealised), and their surroundings are humorously and cleverly realised.

It's been said that the two Ur-models for romances are Beauty and the Beast and Cinderella; this took a while to settle into its destined slot, but arrived there satisfyingly in due course.Generally better writing than many modern genre romances, but the almost complete silence about sex became very noticeable by contrast. It's such a big part of learning how to be a woman at that stage of one's life, the lacunae seemed less discreet than cruel. Well, context.Good outdoors values, ones that I entirely share. I don't see how humans can live in cities.I'm still looking for a more modern dying heroine, for comparisons.

L\u2019emozione con cui mi sono immersa nella lettura \u00e8 anche legata alla penna che l\u2019ha tradotta, Elisabetta Parri, uno degli splendidi regali che mi ha fatto il blog, grazie al quale ho conosciuto anime splendide con cui condividere questo folle amore per la letteratura.Leggere Il Castello Blu ha avuto un effetto balsamico sul mio cuore. Vengo da settimane molto cupe che mi hanno tolto anche il piacere di perdermi tra le pagine di un libro. Il castello blu me l\u2019ha restituita con gli interessi: l\u2019ho divorato in una giornata, arrivando a leggere le ultime righe seduta al ristorante, in barba al galateo (i lettori dovrebbero averne uno a parte). Cos\u2019ha di cos\u00ec speciale? Tutto, fidatevi, ma partiamo dalla protagonista, Valancy Stirling: 29 anni, zitella in un\u2019epoca e in un contesto sociale in cui esserlo aveva tutte le connotazioni negative che, almeno da un punto di vista lessicale, sono state cancellate dal termine single. Quando esserlo era una vergogna per una donna e la privava di ogni valore. A questo dramma, aggiungiamo una famiglia che non perde la minima occasione di sottolineare il suo stato e metterla in ridicolo. Come si sopravvive a un incubo del genere? Valancy ha trovato una via di fuga nel suo castello blu: un palazzo immaginario dove si rifugia sin da piccola ogni volta che ne sente il bisogno.Arriva un giorno, per\u00f2, in cui non riesce pi\u00f9 a raggiungere il suo paradiso interiore e si vede dispiegare davanti a s\u00e9 il grigiore di un\u2019esistenza vuota, segnata dall\u2019amarezza. Tutto \u00e8 semplicemente troppo, e nulla abbastanza potente da salvarla, neppure la fantasia. Ma accade qualcosa che spinge Valancy a dare una svolta alla sua esistenza: le viene diagnosticato un grave problema cardiaco che non le lascia molto da vivere. Non \u00e8 l\u2019idea della morte imminente a spaventarla, ma la consapevolezza di non aver vissuto davvero, soggiogata dalle convenzioni e da una famiglia opprimente. Questa notizia, invece di atterrirla, funge da defibrillatore, e decide di riappropriarsi di se stessa e di ogni singolo istante che le rimane. Ed \u00e8 qui, miei cari, che viene il bello: nel momento in cui si rende conto di non avere nulla da perdere, inizia a vivere sul serio. Abbandona i suoi familiari (che, ignari di tutto, credono sia uscita di senno) e con loro ogni freno imposto da paure vuote e sterili come le convenzioni che le hanno generate e inizia a dare senso alla sua vita rendendosi utile a Cissy Gay, una ragazza ammalata che vive ai margini della societ\u00e0. C\u2019\u00e8 un detto che amo molto secondo cui se non cambi nulla, nulla cambier\u00e0: viceversa, aggiungo io, un piccolo cambiamento pu\u00f2 portare molto lontano. La nuova Valancy diventa irriconoscibile agli occhi di tutti, e se non mi fossi trovata, a quel punto della storia, in un luogo pubblico, mi sarei lanciata in un tifo da stadio, urlando cose come falli neri e Valancy sei tutti noi (abbiate piet\u00e0, sono stata allo stadio due volte solo perch\u00e9 costretta). La verve della Montgomery mi ha fatto pensare alla cara zia Jane, una zia Jane che per\u00f2 ha aumentato il carico di ironia, infatti Valancy osa dire ci\u00f2 che le sue eroine, anche quelle dotate di una lingua particolarmente pungente, avevano taciuto. Ebbene, credo che prendere esempio da lei possa essere una buona cura a tutte le patologie psicosomatiche legate all\u2019inghiottire troppi rospi per il cosiddetto quieto vivere. In una parola: liberatorio!E cos\u00ec Valancy sboccia come quel roseto nel giardino che proprio non voleva saperne di fiorire finch\u00e9 non si \u00e8 decisa a tagliare i rami che lo soffocavano, come parassiti che gli rubavano l\u2019ossigeno. Quando recide le catene che la legano a un passato sterile, Valancy si trasforma giorno dopo giorno, lasciando la sua natura libera di emergere. Si scopre bella, bella come un elfo selvaggio e luminosa come un raggio di luna. \u00c8 l\u2019amore che innesca la trasformazione finale, l\u2019amore e il contatto con la natura incontaminata del Muskoka, di cui l\u2019autrice ci dona delle descrizioni di una bellezza tale da togliere il fiato.\"L\u2019inverno era bello nella \u201clanda desolata\u201d, quasi intollerabilmente bello. Giornate di pura lucentezza. Serate che sembravano coppe d\u2019incanto; la pi\u00f9 pura annata di vino invernale. Notti infuocate dalle stelle. Freddi e squisiti tramonti d\u2019inverno. Adorabili felci di ghiaccio sulle finestre del castello blu. Chiaro di luna sulle betulle in un argenteo disgelo. Irregolari ombre che calavano sui pomeriggi ventosi; lacerate, contorte e fantastiche ombre. Grandi silenzi, austeri e indagatori. Incolte colline, colme di gioielli. Il sole che irrompeva, d\u2019un tratto, attraverso le grigie nubi sopra il lungo e bianco Mistawis. Crepuscoli grigio \u2013 edera investiti da raffiche di neve, durante i quali la loro accogliente sala, con i folletti del focolare e gli imperscrutabili gatti, diveniva ancora pi\u00f9 accogliente. Ogni ora recava con s\u00e9 una nuova rivelazione e una nuova meraviglia.\" p. 180Concludo la recensione cos\u00ec, con un sorso dalla coppa della felicit\u00e0 di Valancy, senza svelarvi altro sulla trama, ma invitandovi a scoprire il lato inedito di un\u2019autrice straordinaria. Lasciatevi rapire da questa storia che trasuda bellezza e desiderio, speranza e libert\u00e0, e che non lesina nei colpi di scena. Soprattutto, ricordate: non \u00e8 mai troppo tardi per cercare il proprio Castello Blu nel mondo reale. I miei complimenti a Elisabetta Parri, la traduttrice, che ha reso possibile anche per noi lettori italiani godere di questo tesoro facendosi tramite invisibile della sua bellezza, senza permettere che andasse persa nemmeno una goccia del suo incanto."}, {"userName": "Rachel", "userReviewDate": "May 03, 2018", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/21391485-rachel", "userReview": "My second time reading this was even more delightful than the first!

It is supposedly Montgomery's only romance written for adults. FREE.  Download from Feedbooks, here http://www.feedbooks.com/book/6444/th...Basic plot: This is a coming-of-age-at-last story. On her 29th bday, Valancy learns that she is dying. This realization suddenly frees her from a lifetime of fearful subservience. She says and does exactly what she wants (haha!), and her mother, the miserable Mrs. Frederick, can go hang with most of her other horrible, lack-wit relatives. Valancy thumbs her nose at all the hypocricy, and follows her heart. While it still beats.One thing has kept Valancy sane amidst her nightmare on Elm Street: her rich imagination, and John Foster's books about wildlife. Because of his books, she loves nature and doesn't fear the woods, the lake, or the night. So...walking away from civilized Deerpark into the wilderness \"up-back\" near the lake, she becomes housekeeper to the town drunk --a likable old rascal -- and carefully nurses his dying daughter, a former classmate. In this rustic shack, she can read whenever she pleases, and there's nobody harping away at her all day. Soon, she finds a soul-deep love. In keeping with her new attitude of fearless living, she throws herself wholeheartedly into his arms. :)This is not always a light-hearted tale, but it is sooo satisfying to see Valancy come into her own. I closed my kindle with a happy sigh, for drab old \"Doss\" had been transformed into \"Moonlight\" by the love of a wild woodsman. Her prince has the soul of a poet and a strong right hook. He also has a \"castle\" on an island, a locked room, and a mysterious past. (And he needs her love just as much as she needs his, as it turns out. )Valancy's spirit is finally free (and that's fun to see). With her prince, she indulges her soul in long nature walks. She discovers her innate sense of style, humor, and adventure -- canoeing, skating, snowshoeing, swimming -- even driving in a fast car. What would mama say? Predictable at times, but Montgomery managed to surprise me with one key detail of Barney's mysterious past. Quite satisfying. Complex yet simple. Layered. Such deliciously demure cheekiness from Valancy towards her contemptible clan. I chuckled several times. I enjoyed the rascally, drunken Presbyterian carpenter, Roaring Abel, and the disreputable \"criminal\" Barney Snaith. Wasn't crazy about sighing dying Cecy, but felt sorry for her. Quibbles: Wanted Mrs. Frederick to get her comeuppance. Uncle Benjamin and a few others, too. Also, the opening chapters focused too much on Valancy's State of Misery. Too many passive \"tellings\" about her childhood heartaches. Also, too many passive tellings about life on the island, at times coming across like a list. (Notable vivid exceptions: the rose bush scene, the potpourri scene, leaving the dance at Chidley Corners, the frightening train scene.) I am not crazy about what Valancy decided to do at the end, after she learned the truth, but I doubt she would have continued along that path for long. Hope not, else the message is that we need a man or death to break free.Quibbles aside, The Blue Castle  is feel-good, poignant, amusing, satirical, and sweet. A classic romance with a little mystery.
