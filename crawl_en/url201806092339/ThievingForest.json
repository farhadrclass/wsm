Tribes of natives, living off the land, seeing the promise of 'Murrica paying off, or tasting it sour in one's mouth: all that speaks to me. And this story did not fail to deliver exactly what I was looking for.A gaggle of recently orphaned women are taken all secret-like by a bunch of natives. What follows is a story of attempted rescue, of severe and forced adaptation, and of redemption or lack thereof. I loved it. The descriptions of how day-to-day life had to be hardcore scraped up from the earth, the superstitions of not only the tribes but also the whites, I was delighted by it all.Really, the only problems I had with this book stemmed from characters' inability to see things from another point of view. There have been many times when a fight's a-brewin' between my ladylove and I, but I abort that thing early by simply viewing things from her perspective, and cancelling out the oh-so-human miscommunication. (I actually think this sometimes bothers her, and she'd really rather fight it out. But I'm a lover, not a fighter. Mostly.) There were a few times I found myself near head-banging-to-wall frustrated with the characters' thought processes. But it turned out that it was all just part of their development as people, and, I think maybe, mine as a reader, as well.All in all, a beautifully told story of life in the frontier American west, and how hard won any semblance of happiness or safety can be."}, {"userName": "Mary", "userReviewDate": "Jun 16, 2015", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/15852313-mary", "userReview": "Loved the story!

It's no secret that I love Historical Fiction, so I was very happy to win this book, but it was so much better than I was expecting! This is the story of a family of 5 girls living in a small \"village\" in 1806. Their parents have just recently passed. Another younger sister has been living in Philadelphia with an aunt and the girls are trying to decide whether to stay and try to run the family store or leave and join their sister in Philly. We get a quick glimpse of their personalities and how they interact, and then danger arrives as four of the older girls are kidnapped by Indians. Susanna, 17, is left behind and she quickly rallies, determined to go after her sisters. The story is more complex than a simple Indian abduction, the family has had good relations with the natives, there is more beneath the surface. Susanna learns that many people are not who they present themselves to be and she has to learn whom she can trust and that will often surprise her.The novel takes the reader on Susanna's journey as she attempts to find and rescue her sisters. Who helps her, who she meets along the way, the dangers she encounters on her voyage, how she survives, what she discovers about herself and the others she meets; including different bands of natives and a religious group, are what make this book so fascinating. There is so much attention to detail, so much respect for different cultures and beliefs and they are presented from many differing points of view. The landscape itself becomes a character and the descriptions are so vivid and so astoundingly different from what exists now in the part of Ohio that borders Lake Erie south of Toledo. There are themes of self discovery, personal growth, romance, family ties, loyalty and more in this book and Conway resorts to cliches. Her characters are complex, thoughtful and fully realized. The fates of each sister differ and each path and choice is so interesting. They challenge the reader to wonder what they would have done in each situation under the same circumstances. This was a fairly quick read, mostly because I could not put it down!! This book would be a great Book Club selection as there are so many themes and issues to discuss!!"}, {"userName": "Shomeret", "userReviewDate": "Sep 20, 2014", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/1842352-shomeret", "userReview": "Susanna Quiner hid while she watched four of her sisters being violently torn from their home by a party of Potawatami warriors. Is this the opening scene of a propaganda piece designed to show us how savage the original inhabitants of North America were? Thieving Forest by Martha Conway may seem that way initially, but this story line is more complex than readers might think. It takes place in early 19th century America. The novel\u2019s portrayal of the period is neither utopian nor dystopian. Martha Conway goes for realism. There are both horrific events and wonderful ones. The capture of these sisters isn\u2019t what it appears to be. Each of the Quiner sisters has her own individual destiny. Susanna is determined to restore her family to the situation that had existed before they were captured, but neither her sisters nor their home were ever going to be the same. This is a lesson that Susanna learns over the course of the novel.For my complete review see http://wwwbookbabe.blogspot.com/2014/..."}, {"userName": "Angela M", "userReviewDate": "Aug 19, 2014", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/4685500-angela-m", "userReview": "The story is compelling and the history is interesting but I couldn't quite connect with any of the sisters, except Susanna.

Thank you NetGalley!3.5 StarsSet in 1806 Severne, Ohio, the Thieving Forest is a tale of survival for Susanna Quiner and her 5 sisters as they learn to care for themselves and decide the fate of their future after the loss of both of their parents to Swamp Fever. After a morning of bickering over what they should do, Susanna goes outside to tend to the chickens. After hearing and seeing some savages come through the woods, she hides behind a tree, watching helplessly as a band of Potawatomi Indians kidnap her 4 sisters and head back into the Thieving Forest. \nThieving Forest is an ancient forest crowded with decrepit elms and maples and oak, too many of them fallen for a comfortable crossing, a place settlers generally go around rather than through. It got its name after a band of Sauk Indians tried to hide some stolen horses there. Severne sits on its southern edge like a fly on the rim of a saucer. On the other side of the forest lies the Great Black Swamp---a dark wooded bog nearly the size of Connecticut---and beyond that is Lake Erie. Rumors circulate about the unholy creatures that make their home in the Black Swamp: swine wolves, frogs with fins and teeth. Naomi has even heard that there are bands of backward men living among its stunted trees, and that there is no end to it, and no sunlight within, and no food. \nDistraught and not knowing what to do, Susanna runs to their neighbor Amos Spendlove for help gathering the men to go after them. Not finding anyone home, she waits for hours, only to be told that all of the men are too busy out tending to their farms and cannot help her. Seeing no other options, she decides to embark on a rescue mission into the forest herself, hoping to trade what little possessions she has left for their lives. Over the next few months, Susanna travels all over the region, spending time at a missionary village and wading through the seemingly endless Black Swamp in order to find her sisters. Contending with fear and starvation, Susanna discovers more about herself (and her sisters) than she ever expected. Desperately in love with Susanna, Seth Spendlove (Amos' son), sets out after her when he find out of his father's involvement in the kidnapping... along with one of the original Potawatomi kidnappers, seeking his own retribution. While unsure of the historical accuracy of everything, this fast paced tale of the Quiner sisters is entertaining. All of the sisters contend with their own issues, including those \u201cof starvation, slavery, betrayal, and love\u201d that changes you they were and who they thought they wanted to be.My only criticism would be that the other sisters characters were not developed enough. It is clear that Conway wanted to give their perspectives, but in order for the reader to develop feelings for the other sisters, we needed more. I also found it slightly aggravating how shallow and self-involved they all seemed given the situation. If it were not for Susanna, Seth, and Meera, I do not know that I would have cared for this novel as much."}, {"userName": "Diane Barnes", "userReviewDate": "Jun 19, 2015", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/7262060-diane-barnes", "userReview": "This book hit a lot of marks for me. Pioneer living by white and native Americans in the wilds of Ohio in 1805, check. Adventure tale involving snake bites, starvation, slavery, cruelty, kindness from unexpected quarters, and courage, check. Strong women characters meeting challenges and overcoming difficulties, check. Well researched, well written historical fiction, check.The bare bones of this novel begins with the kidnapping of the 4 Quiner sisters, witnessed by the 5th sister, Susanna, who was sent to feed the hog. She impulsively goes after them herself when she can't get any response from the men in the settlement. I thought the events that transpired as she searches for her sisters were realistically portrayed, and Native American characters and tribes very sympathetically dealt with. There was also some very beautiful and descriptive nature writing that I appreciated as well. An excellent first novel by any standards. Very highly recommended.

When she says something is not to be missed, she's right!"}, {"userName": "Katherine Hajer", "userReviewDate": "Oct 26, 2014", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/11130792-katherine-hajer", "userReview": "When Susanna looks down at the peapods again she sees the new black lace on her cuff. Her parents died almost two weeks ago and only one day apart, Ellen first and then Sirus, as unexpected as two suns setting in the same evening. Susanna, who is superstitious, has put a piece of rowan wood in the pocket of her black dress to guard against ghosts, although she misses her mother, and would almost chance the frightening encounter in order to see her again. She's lonely for her. She's lonely for both of them. Part of her feels gone as well, like there's a room in her home that she can't go to anymore, a locked door. She thinks of her mother's freckled hands cutting bread.\nThieving Forest is being marketed as a Young Adult book, which I think is very unfair. It is suitable for young adults, being focused on a sixteen-year-old girl and with suitable content, but it would appeal just as well to anyone who enjoys well-researched historical novels. The main character is Susanna Quiner, the second-youngest of six sisters, and of life in the swamps and forests of Ohio in 1806. The youngest sister, Lilith, still lives in Philadelphia, which makes Susanna effectively the youngest. Before their parents' deaths, and certainly afterwards, the older sisters tend to order Susanna around, which is precisely why she is out of the house doing chores when the rest of her sisters are kidnapped and taken into the nearby forest. The only one left free, Susanna decides the only right thing to do is lead a search party to rescue her sisters.The first thing I noticed reading Thieving Forest was the use of the present tense. It was unsettling for the first five pages or so to read an historical novel using this, but after the brief adjustment period it becomes an excellent device for pulling the reader into the story. The choice of verb tense reflects well on the rest of the prose elements \u2014 the writing is vivid but not florid, in a style that reminded me of Hemingway, but without his intense brevity.The next noticeable thing is the incredible care taken with historical accuracy. Certainly the details all tallied with what I remember from school about the same period in Canadian history. The characters embody what is beautiful, ugly, great, and awful about this part of America in the early nineteenth century. To accomplish this, of course, the characters need to be well-rounded, and it was a real pleasure to see all of the various character arcs weaving through the story. Characters it was easy to dismiss as minor grow in importance, while ones that were essential fade away. Susanna is the through line, the reader's window into this world. The author doesn't shy away from depicting common prejudices of the time \u2014 instead, they are included as important plot points, as much as they may make the contemporary reader wince. A major theme is that any community will include good people and bad, leaders and layabouts.\nThe men shake their heads. The woman who collected bird bones looks at Seth. \"Your women lost?\" she says in English. \"No good.\"\n\nHe tells her in Potawatomi that the two women are heading north. They are going to the Maumee. One has red hair.\n\"Many streams here.\" She shakes her head. \"You are the first chmokman I see.\"One aspect of the historical accuracy that I particularly enjoyed was how all of the major characters were multilingual. The ones who speak English as a first language know a little French, and are near-fluent in at least one First Nations language. The First Nations characters may or may not know English, but the major characters have at least a little French, or know other native languages besides the one their own nation uses. The characters' language knowledge doesn't slow down the dialogue or the plot at all \u2014 on the contrary, it enhances both. It also points out that the story takes place before the famous American \"melting pot\" effect has had a chance to work. The Midwest as such simply doesn't exist yet.I have to admit: I was nervous about reviewing this book. The promotional blurb is up-front about the detail that the sisters were kidnapped by Potawatomi Indians, and I worried that the story would divide a little too neatly along the traditional Western \"Indians bad except for this one token character/whites good except for this one token character\" lines. I was relieved and very pleased to discover that this is not the case at all \u2014 even the sisters' kidnapping is a far more complex affair than it appears at the beginning of the book. I would be very curious to read a critique of the book from a First Nations perspective, though.The only note of caution is that the depiction of life in 1806 Ohio is not romanticised at all. Characters get realistic injuries, and have realistic, 19th-century style medical care for them. Some characters die from injuries or illnesses which wouldn't even warrant a hospital stay in a modern city. Having said that, the physical details are sometimes grim but never gratuitous. There is absolutely no lazy-writer hand-waving over details like how to find food in a swamp with minimal tools and skills. When, late in the book, a character catches a vole for dinner, as a reader you're far too busy being happy that they won't starve after all to feel repugnance. (All right, not much repugnance. The point stands.)Thieving Forest is the first five-star rating I've given on Goodreads since I read Wool, over a year ago. The clear writing style, vivid characters, well-turned plot, beautifully illustrated themes, and thoroughly-researched historical setting make it a very rewarding read."}, {"userName": "Conan Putnam", "userReviewDate": "Aug 11, 2014", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/3986318-conan-putnam", "userReview": "Riveting and incandescent as it is meticulously researched, Thieving Forest is an extraordinary novel woven out of the lore of Indian captivity narratives. After losing their parents, the orphaned Quiner sisters face the daunting prospect of making their family\u2019s store thrive in the tiny settlement of Severne on the edge of Ohio\u2019s Great Black Swamp. The sisters\u2019 lives are suddenly turned upside down on a summer day in 1806 when a band of Potawatomi Indians raid their home and kidnap all but one, 17-year-old Susanna, the youngest. Over the course of a few months\u2019 journey, her search for her lost siblings evolves into a moving drama of survival and self-creation in the wilderness. Susanna\u2019s growing confidence in her way of seeing the world and thinking about her life as an independent person, no longer reliant on her sisters\u2019 opinions of who she is in relation to them is a fascinating subject and Martha Conway\u2019s exploration of its complexities accounts for a great deal of the novel\u2019s charm.Reader expectations are not always met in conventional ways in this book. Conway\u2019s insistence on rejecting predictability in favor of something more risky and open-ended seems to undercut the idea that the creation of a solid, established world is what a novel should be about. Happily, this will be catnip to readers who feel that the most interesting novels are always a bit strange.

And not just life in any one white settlement or Indian tribe, but across a wide range of diverse groups. Second, it\u2019s got the \"fiction.\" If you like stories, here are five: four sisters kidnapped by Indians, and a fifth who sets out in pursuit. The stories of the sisters branch, some of them rejoining and some of them reaching ends of their own, and Conway follows them all. I loved this book for its steady tone that, like the forest itself, served as a kind of matter-of-fact backdrop to the wild highs and lows the sisters undergo, the characterizations that were remarkably free of clich\u00e9 and stereotype even among the minor characters, and the overall shape of the story that comes together at the end.Note: some readers might be confused or disappointed fairly early in the book when it turns out it\u2019s not going to be the simple story of rescue or whodunit that it might appear at first to be. But hang in there, because the ultimate picture, though not perhaps as dramatic or colorful as a simpler story might have been, is almost certainly truer to real life as it\u2019s lived in most times and places."}, {"userName": "Mandy", "userReviewDate": "Aug 26, 2014", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/5859680-mandy", "userReview": "What a marvellously accomplished and compelling book this is! Meticulously and painstakingly researched, carefully paced, with a cast of realistic and intriguing characters and with a plot that makes the novel a real page-turner, this is one of my reading highlights for this year. It tells the story of five sisters whose parents have died and who are coming to terms with their possible future in Severne, Ohio at the turn of the 19th century. Then one day they are captured in an Indian raid and their lives are changed forever. Susanna manages to hide behind a tree and watches as her sisters are carried off. Without considering the matter too much she sets off to rescue them, but her quest develops in ways she could never have imagined, and the reactions to her efforts by her surviving sisters are not always what she expects.Martha Conway gives the reader a vivid portrait of life among the different Native American tribes and the relationship between them and the European settlers. Matters are far more complex and nuanced than we might expect. As indeed, is the relationship between the sisters, and Conway confounds our expectations just as she does Susanna\u2019s at every twist and turn.It\u2019s a riveting story of survival, loyalty, betrayal and self-interest, with a good measure of love thrown in to the mix, all making for a wonderfully engaging and often thought-provoking novel of life in the early days of US expansion into Indian Territory."}, {"userName": "Malena Watrous", "userReviewDate": "Dec 11, 2014", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/2925839-malena-watrous", "userReview": "I loved this novel from the first page to the last.

It manages to sensitive characterizations with a taut, high-powered plot, all while digging deep into a fascinating historical era in ways that are engaging, believable, and extremely well realized.

Ohio has such a rich Native American history across the entire state and it's especially stimulating to find a fictional tale that helps me envision more than I know, while keeping a positive spin on the people and their customs.Two weeks after her parents die of swamp fever, seventeen-year-old Susanna Quiner can think of nothing else but her superstitions and going back to Philadelphia. Trying to run their store in the new town of Severne, Ohio, with her four sisters without their parents to guide them, seems futile when winter will be upon them soon and there is no man to hunt for their food.While outside doing chores, Susanna sees several Potawatomi emerge from the Thieving Forest which isn't unusual since they trade with many of the tribes as much as they do the pioneers passing through, but the men are not going to the front of the store but toward their cabin. Her sister Aurelia is outside feeding her chickens and Susanna tries to attract her attention to no avail. Hiding behind a tree, Susanna is horrified to see her three older sisters pulled outside of the cabin by the men, then Aurelia taken as well, tied up along with some of their possessions, and then forced through the woods. Should she follow or risk the time it will take to find help?Beatrice, Penelope, Aurelia and Naomi are pushed forward at a furious pace through the forest. They're being taken north, hopeful that they'll be ransomed in Risdale and not sold off to the highest bidder, or worse, forced to be wives or killed for not being capable slaves. Meanwhile, Susanna runs off to the nearest cabin in town for help. She can hardly think and she can't seem to get her point across to her neighbor, Amos Spendlove, that he must bring in the men from the fields to form a search party for her sisters. She fears mostly for her sister Aurelia who is still suffering from a fever. She's told by another neighbor that if Aurelia's ill, the Potawatomi will kill her, rather than take her illness back to their people, as is their way. Susanna rushes off to find Old Adam, a Miami Indian who is married to a Shawnee, a friend who she's sure knows his way in the forest and will help her track her sisters.Cade and Seth Spendlove are on their way back from selling the Quiner sisters' wagon for them, per their father, Amos' request, when they learn of the sisters' capture from one of their neighbors who is searching for them. Seth had bought a ring that he plans to give to Susanna, hopeful that she will be his wife. Cade plans to marry Aurelia. The Spendloves are half-brothers and have inherited their father's part-Potawatomi blood, although they haven't told anyone since they also each had a Bavarian mother and it's hard to discern their background by their looks. Cade and Seth both suspect their father of some sort of foul play, doubting that the Quiner sisters ever wanted their wagon sold. They decide to search for them as well, hoping to come across Susanna on the way, without returning to their father with the money for the wagon he had them sell. They feel that money should go to Susanna for her family but Seth isn't quite sure how he'll tell her his suspicions about his father, or that he's part Potawatomi, when he proposes. Will she even consider him as her husband after what has happened?I'm not sure of the accuracy of the historical details in this novel because I'm more familiar with Native American history in Ohio in the 1700s, more so than the early 1800s, but the storytelling is realistic and believable so it is easy to envision it as plausible as it happens in this fictional tale. If you're curious, there's a good PBS special online regarding the Black Swamp history that will give you a feel for the difficulties that the pioneers faced, such as the mosquitoes, hence the fevers, as well as the flies, muck and rain, making it difficult to farm or even walk through the rich earth. If you love hiking the marshes that are now being reestablished in Ohio's parks as much as I do, then you'll relate to what it may have been like in 1808 in the Black Swamp near Toledo as you're reading this adventure.I'm particularly fond of colonial stories, especially when they depict the pioneers of different nationalities working alongside the natives. Sure, there are villains, plus gruesome and sad circumstances, but it's the learning to live together that fascinates me the most. There are the language and custom barriers to be crossed and understood, and all of this is very well done in this story.Susanna is the spoiled youngest sister, not expected to work as hard or to be as brave as the rest of her sisters. She doesn't know how to do much of anything since she has always had others around to help her. When faced with working at a mission to earn her keep, she befriends a native girl who becomes her companion on part of her journey. It's a good thing she made that friend because I'm not sure she would have made it on her own. The land is pretty hostile at this time in history and I doubt that many women had the knowledge or the strength to survive these harsh conditions alone. The loneliness itself would have been difficult enough, but there are bears and wolves to fear, along with the sheer volume of the gathering and hunting needed to survive while on the run. If you want to appreciate what you have now in comparison, the reality in this novel will surely do that for you.All five sisters have a story to tell and this book follows them as Susanna searches to bring them all back together. Quite an adventure, there's never a dull moment as Susanna grows up and becomes a woman of substance. Don't think that this is a \"woman is captured by Indians and forced to be their wife\" kind of story because it's not. It's much richer than that and explores the many possible antidotes of what could happen to five women if separated by circumstances in a frontier just being established.After reading this book I'm very hopeful that author Martha Conway continues to write historical stories set in Ohio. There are so few of them and the history is so fascinating that it's pure pleasure to find an author who seems to appreciate it as much as I do and writes such an engaging story that brings it all together. Martha Conway's style depicts a love of the land and the people who strove to survive it. I recommend THIEVING FOREST to historical lovers who crave the stories of our brave pioneers who settled in Ohio when roads were paths well worn by hunters and the hunted.Reviewed by Dorine, courtesy of Romance Junkies.

Conway does an excellent job conveying the brutality and tedium of the sisters' forced journey through the American wilderness. Unexpected allies and terrors keep the narrative momentum crackling as the sisters navigate physical challenges, a harsh environment, and their own psychological limitations. Ultimately, it is a survival story that explores questions of character and human resilience."}, {"userName": "Chae", "userReviewDate": "Sep 06, 2017", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/70771764-chae", "userReview": "I really enjoyed how this story portrays women as strong and able to fend for themselves during a time when it wasn't common. It was entertaining and had a good story."}, {"userName": "Patricia", "userReviewDate": "Apr 19, 2015", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/4265883-patricia", "userReview": "I read this for free on Kindle Unlimited, and returned the ebook after rating the book but before writing a review. This account of a family of sisters whose parents fell ill and died, leaving them a frontier store in Ohio, was engaging and kept my interest. It was fairly well written. The author was raised with several sisters, and did a nice job fleshing out four or five dissimilar young women while still conveying their bond and common upbringing. The perils faced by protagonist Susanna and her sisters at the hands of Native Americans and their own settler neighbors, while harrowing, seemed realistic for the time and place. The characters are complex, and change over the course of events. The dilemma of whom to trust is downright exhausting. And the natural history seems authentic and detailed. The resolution and ending were not predictable...certainly worth reading to the end."}, {"userName": "Steve", "userReviewDate": "Aug 17, 2014", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/7175460-steve", "userReview": "A sweeping tale of loss and love and coming home again. This is a thoroughly enjoyable read. A very well written tale of sisters separated by greed and tragedy. Amazing research into Native American culture and tribe placement. I often found myself wondering what else can go wrong and how much more can this woman suffer. At each turn, you are rooting for her to turn back, save herself. These are some extremely well fleshed out characters. You feel for each and every one of them and all the tribulations thrown their way. These characters evolve in front of your eyes, and all that they thought they wanted shifts and changes to reflect the new people they have become."}, {"userName": "Christine", "userReviewDate": "Jan 19, 2015", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/8554815-christine", "userReview": "Boring... I have read so many quality books about Indian abductions and this one just could not measure up. I was excited to read about Indian abductions in the area where I live, but the story was unbelievable, unrealistic character interactions.. more of a young adult, child story."}, {"userName": "Ricki Ward", "userReviewDate": "Aug 13, 2014", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/5140015-ricki-ward", "userReview": "[Susanna's return home (hide spoiler)]"}], "description": "On a humid morning in 1806, seventeen-year-old Susanna Quiner watches helplessly from behind a tree while a band of Potawatomi Indians kidnaps her four older sisters from their cabin.

Over the next five months, Susanna tans hides in a Moravian missionary village; escapes down a river with a young native girl; discovers an eccentric white woman raising chickens in the middle of the Great Black Swamp; and becomes a servant in a Wyandot village longhouse. The man who loves her, Seth Spendlove, is in pursuit after he realizes that his father was involved in the kidnapping. Part Potawatomi himself but living a white man\u2019s life, Seth unwittingly sets off on his own quest to reclaim his birthright. He allies himself with a Potawatomi named Koman, one of the band of men who originally abducted the Quiner sisters, but who now wishes to make his own retribution.

Fast-paced and richly detailed, Thieving Forest explores the transformation of all five sisters as the Quiners contend with starvation, slavery, betrayal, and love. It paints a fascinating new picture of pioneer life among Native American communities, while telling a gripping tale of survival.", "title": "Thieving Forest", "url": "http://www.goodreads.com/book/show/22881466-thieving-forest", "average": 3.9, "cover": "https://images.gr-assets.com/books/1407373005l/22881466.jpg", "reviews": 147, "authors": [{"url": "https://www.goodreads.com/author/show/23092.Martha_Conway", "name": "Martha Conway"}], "type": ["Historical", "Fiction", "Historical"], "outlinks": ["http://www.goodreads.com/book/show/22881466-thieving-forest", "http://www.goodreads.com/book/show/28073103-thieving-forest", "http://www.goodreads.com/book/show/24426709-thieving-forest", "http://www.goodreads.com/book/show/32920286-the-underground-river", "http://www.goodreads.com/book/show/33380114-sugarland", "http://www.goodreads.com/book/show/41050.12_Bliss_Street"]}
