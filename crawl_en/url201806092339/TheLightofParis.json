Unfortunately this book is very different. It's told in two parts -- a 1924 story of Margie and a 1999 story of Madeleine. Margie's story is written in what I can only describe as \"YA style\" and Madeleine's story is a \"beach read\" at best. Other reviewers are enjoying this and giving it high marks, so I would encourage readers to seek out reviews other than mine if you're considering this book. I am just not the right audience for this book, though I do recommend The Weird Sisters.I'm not assigning stars because I didn't finish the book. Thank you to NetGalley and G.P.

It is exquisitely written with so many layers. I read the first 6 pages about a dozen times because it was so beautiful. It is the story of two women in different times, Margie in 1920s Paris and her granddaughter Madeleine. Both are unhappy until they find the courage to change their lives. It's about coming to terms with who you are and accepting yourself. I can't wait until this book is out July 12, 2016.

The trope of \"my mother doesn't love me\"/\"I don't look right\"/\"my life traps me\" kept coming up so often--nearly word for word--that it felt like each chapter was reintroducing itself. Oh--and, brace yourself: apparently adolescence and high school can be a challenging time! I kept listening and waiting for something unique, interesting, self-aware, or funny, but when I realized I was yelling, \"Enough with the whining!\" I decided to give up.

She discovers  in an attic, the journals of her (secretive life) grandmother, Margie, who spent time in 1924 Paris Jazz Age-a world of freedom, art, and love- which changed her life. What happened to this life, the dreams, aspirations?  This is the life, Madeleine longs for.  She never knew this grandmother. Madeleine and Maggie are very similar in many ways. Both generations have demands from family and told to put dreams aside. Obligations. They both did the same\u2014things they swore they would not do. Learning from the past.

Her grandmother, Margie  spent time in Paris, writing, a man, an artist, creativity, the dreams. Where did it all go wrong? Why was she not told about her grandmother\u2019s past? How did her own mother come to be the way she is today? Reading her grandmother\u2019s journals  was like reading her own thoughts. She wanted to connect with her and felt something was unfinished. She couldn\u2019t explain why she never felt like she belonged. Could she possibly finish the life for her grandmother? Going abroad by herself signified a bravery she had not considered she possessed.Can Madeline find her own way? Away from social pedigrees? To dance, eat, travel, laugh, and paint. The what if?

Any story that transports me to that lovely city is one I\u2019m always eager to dive into. Having never been and journeying with these characters as Margie had the experience of a life time makes me long to visit one day! Eleanor Brown truly knows how to catapult her readers into her story and have them feel like they are traveling right alongside her characters.In this story, Madeleine finds herself in a marriage that wasn\u2019t quite what she envisioned for herself. It\u2019s a loveless connection to say the least, but she\u2019s also sacrificed quite a bit to accommodate her family\u2019s expectations. Madeleine has given up the things she loved the most, especially expressing herself through painting. So when she travels to her hometown to visit her mother, she comes across her grandmother\u2019s journals that have her connecting with Margie in a way that awakens her desire to live according to her own terms once again. Margie is a character that took a risk during a time that women had minimal say in how their lives turned out, but a few months in Paris showed her that independence and chasing your dream is more important than any expectation society can place on a girl.I really enjoyed getting to know Margie and Madeleine. There were moments in the beginning of the novel that I longed for stronger characters, but it was quickly made clear that The Light of Paris is a story about self-discovery and growth, which ultimately happened for these two ladies. Seeing their steady transformation as the novel progressed was both rewarding and gratifying.Reading about the cafes, theatres, libraries and people of Paris was absolutely magical. Eleanor Brown did an amazing job of making Margie\u2019s journey come to life. I often felt like I was strolling the streets of Paris right alongside this amazing character.Overall, The Light of Paris is a story that is filled with commendable characters and memorable moments, all alongside a backdrop of the perfect city.

She finds herself to be not only unhappy, but she no longer paints, which is the thing that she loves the most in life. Her husband controls every aspect of her life and the worst part about it is the fact that she lets him. She escapes for a few days to her hometown to visit her mother and she comes across her grandmother's old journals. Her grandmother was a very elegant woman, the very opposite of Madeleine, but that wasn't always the case. As Madeleine reads more of her grandmother's journals, she comes to realize that her grandmother, Margie, is an unconventional woman and spent a few months living in Paris during the 20s. Margie ends up inspiring Madeleine to branch out and actually start living her life regardless of what her husband or judge-y mother thinks.

The story didn't stand out for me. A woman finds her grandmother's journals packed away in the attic and discovers that she was once a very different woman than the one she'd known. Who hasn't read that before? A love story in Paris during the Jazz Age ...of course I was drawn to that! But I found the main character of modern day, Madeline, to be almost pathetic at times. She is \"trapped\" in her rich girl, loveless, and controlling marriage. Her mother's disapproval & her acceptance of it seems outdated & unbelievable. In the author's attempt to make her appear in sync with her 1920's counterpart, Margie her grandmother, she instead looked like she was plucked from that time and just dropped into 1999. Maybe 1959 would've been more believable. I almost expected a description of her outfit to contain a corset because that's how outdated her traits & interactions appeared. Her relationships are complete emotional abuse. Still, her internal talk is simply annoying. \"What will I do?, who will I be? No one will marry me, I can't eat cake or someone will say I'm fat..\" Can you sense my eye rolls? Neither female character seemed to think much of herself so it was difficult to connect. My overall feeling toward them was frustration. The setting and story itself, although nothing new, kept me reading.

Each woman must figure out living the life that makes her happiest while balancing the expectations of their families and society.It\u2019s hard to write a real synopsis of this story without giving too much away, but basically it\u2019s half women\u2019s fiction and half historical fiction, with each chapter alternating between Madeleine and Margie. I really enjoyed reading this and am so glad I was able to get to it so quickly!Madeleine is a mid-thirties reluctant housewife who robotically does what\u2019s expected of her, even though it\u2019s killing her on the inside. This isn\u2019t the Madeleine we see most of the time, though, because when she\u2019s away from her husband (who seems totally awful, by the way), she\u2019s a completely different person. I think there\u2019s something in Madeleine that we can all sympathize with and relate to.Margie\u2019s story is told through her diaries, but sort of. It\u2019s kind of like Madeleine narrating her grandmother\u2019s diaries, which was my least favorite part of the way this story was told. Personally, I would have preferred for Madeleine to keep to her own chapters and to have Margie\u2019s personality shine through instead, especially since her story came from journals she wrote. I could have read a full book about Margie and wished I could have seen more of her.I\u2019m obsessed with all things Parisian, and I loved reading about Margie\u2019s life in Paris, even if she wasn\u2019t there for a long time. Someday, hopefully I\u2019ll be able to spend months in Paris. I\u2019m convinced that\u2019s the only way you can really experience the city, and it seems like Margie would have agreed with me. In Madeleine\u2019s words, Margie \u201chad fallen hopelessly in love with Paris,\u201d and I totally understand the feeling.The characters throughout this book are interesting and real. I enjoyed seeing them change and seeing their relationships with and perceptions of each other evolve. I was especially happy to see Madeleine\u2019s relationship with her mother shift to something more mature.This book had two great stories and I really loved how they came together. I gave this book four stars because I loved the story, but I wished Margie\u2019s story had gotten more time and that Madeleine hadn\u2019t been interjected into Margie\u2019s chapters.*ARC from NetGalley"}, {"userName": "Anne", "userReviewDate": "Jul 19, 2016", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/546484-anne", "userReview": "One of the best ways for any author or publisher to tempt me with a book is to mention that it's a dual-time narrative and that one of the eras is the 1920s (or the 1960s, I adore them both!). When I read the blurb about The Light of Paris and saw mention of 1920s Jazz Age Paris, I knew that this was a story for me.The Light of Paris is an absolute joy to read. Eleanor Brown's two lead characters, Madeleine and Margie are separated by seventy years, yet they have so many things in common. Madeleine's life is coming unstuck and she's found herself staying with her mother in her old bedroom, in her childhood home, surrounded by people who've known her for a lifetime.When Madeleine discovers her grandmother Margie's diary, she is transfixed and discovers things about her, and her family that she had no idea about. Margie's story seems to spur Madeleine along, and it's not long before she is a permanent resident of the small Southern town, leaving her controlling husband far behind. She then discovers more of Margie's life ... and secrets.The compare and contrast between these two women is done incredibly well, and it is clear that in parts of society, attitudes towards those women who don't quite fit the mould. are just as strong now as they were in the 1920s.Whilst I enjoyed the 1990s setting and the at times, hateful people who inhabit Madeleine's home town, I was absolutely smitten by Margie's time in Jazz Age Paris. She lived alone, she danced, she loved, she discovered things that she'd never imagined and certainly would never have seen if she hadn't travelled to Europe. Her time there was short, but Eleanor Brown vividly and brilliantly brought the city to life and the reader experiences Margie's joy alongside her.This is an easy-to-read and thoughtful story that I enjoyed very much. The author deals with the hugest of choices and how those can affect the generations that come afterwards.

My trip was ending with a 3 day stay in Paris. My first time visiting. I must say, I really enjoyed the dual time line of this book. Madeleine in present day and Margie in Jazz Age Paris. Madeleine is unhappy in her marriage, but feels stuck, not sure what she wants to do. After a nasty argument with her controlling husband, Madeleine escapes to her childhood home, but she and her mother have never had the best relationship, so she may have gone from the frying pan into the fire! Madeleine's mother is selling the family home to move to a senior living community and she gets stuck helping with the packing and sorting of years of family junk and heirlooms. During the packing she finds an old diary belong to her grandmother Margie and is shocked to find out how her grandmother was skirting convention and living life to the fullest during an age of discovery. Margie was trying to become a writer, hanging out in cafes and salons with artists and bohemians of the day. Madeleine is captivated by Margie's zest for life, but wonders what happened to the irrepressible girl, since Madeleine's mother had always said her mother was someone who always followed societal rules. While learning more of Margie's Paris life, Madeleine has her own summer of discovery, getting back to her artistic roots and maybe finding love along the way. This was a delightfully told story.

It was a fantastic read, although I will confess that it was probably, in parts, a bit too high brow for me. I probably missed a lot of context in the novel, it was written so lyrically, but I loved it. It was such a good read. So much so, that I've been hankering after a new Eleanor Brown book for years. I thought one was coming a year after The Weird Sisters, but that was Amazon being tinkers. Instead it has been four long years, but The Light of Paris is finally here, and it was so worth the wait.I actually really love stories that are set over two time periods, and have two different voices. It's always so intriguing to me to hear from voices way back when, times I've never heard of or never experienced, it's always really eye-opening and Margie's life in the 1920s was both sad and amazing. It's actually pretty scary how similar Margie and Madeleine's lives are, considering there's 70 years between them, but as it turns out, 70 years changes nothing when it comes to parental expectations, clearly. Considering what Margie goes through, it kind of baffled me how Madeleine's life turned out, you would kind of hoped that something might have changed? But, no. I would have actually loved more of Margie's story, because it just felt like there was more to the story, afterwards. There was very little wrong with this book, I really loved Madeleine's voice, and it was interesting to see her find herself, after so many years spent under other people's thumbs. Sure, it kind of baffled me how she had lived her life - after all, this was not actually the 1920s but the late 1990s, so if she was unhappy in her marriage surely the right thing to do would be to leave? Instead of stay out of misguided loyalty? But, maybe that's just the way for some people, and not having been in that situation myself it's hard to judge. Seeing her in her element, in her hometown was amazing, and I loved her friendship with Henry. He completely brightened up the novel.I really enjoyed The Light of Paris. The dual storyline was amazing - Madeleine's voice was strong and really easy to read, and then Margie's story really was thrilling, to see someone experiencing something so transformative was delightful. You could feel Margie's excitement at being in Paris, you could literally walk the streets with her in your imagination. Eleanor Brown truly is an amazing storyteller, and if it takes her another four years to write book three, I am FINE WITH THAT.

No remuneration was exchanged and all opinions presented herein are my own except as noted.This is a story about women and the gilded cage. It is told in split time: Madeleine in 1999 USA and her grandmother, Margie, in 1924 USA and Paris. Both women yearn to be creative, but are tied down by family and society and the creature comforts offered by wealth.Here\u2019s the deal: I believe it could happen in 1924, but I just don\u2019t buy Madeleine\u2019s oppression in 1999. Maybe in 1959, or 1969 but, 1999 is a little too late for the kind of arrangement where a husband is not going to allow his wife to work because it will look like he cannot support her.I can believe Margie, in 1924 would have to truly break away from her family to come into her own even a little bit. But, Madeleine has all kinds of advantages and education and I didn\u2019t believe her story at all.That pretty much annoyed me throughout the book. Granted, Madeleine could have been a totally spineless woman, but she isn\u2019t. She completely bowed to family pressures and married her asinine husband who treats her like a commodity. And, she is kind of whiny. She would not get where she ends up without a lot of analysis.I wasn\u2019t impressed by either story; Margie\u2019s didn\u2019t feel real to me either. Too many coincidences line up too easily. She needs a place to live and voila! a guy she meets in a cafe tells her about a \u201cclub\u201d that rents rooms to American girls! And, she needs a job and one just happens to be available. What is going to happen to Margie is fairly obvious. She does have a great idea about the situation.So this book didn\u2019t do it for me but Cassandra Clare did a great job with the narration.

Madeleine is trapped in a loveless marriage and has had to give up her dreams of being an artist because her husband and mother thought that it was a ridiculous waste of time. Margie had given up her dreams to be a writer and was being forced into marriage because her parents didn't want her to be a spinster. When Madeleine goes to visit her mother, she finds Margie's journals about the three months that she spent in Paris pursuing her dreams. Will reading Margie's journals give Madeleine the courage to make changes in her life?The author did a fantastic job with the two main characters. They are both very complex but sympathetic and have a lot in common despite the years that separate them.One of my favorite parts of the novel were the descriptions of Paris during Margie's time there. I love Paris and I love reading books about that wonderful city. The author didn't disappoint me at all with the Paris that she wrote about.Thanks to NetGalley for providing a copy of this book for a fair and honest review."}, {"userName": "Stephen", "userReviewDate": "Jul 13, 2016", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/4412069-stephen", "userReview": "thanks to netgalley and the publishers for a free copy in return for open and honest review.this is a story of a grandmother and grand daughter in different era's and the grand daughter reads her grandmother's journals when she is in Paris in 1924 and sees her in a different light, as the book shifts between 1919-1924 and 1999. had a slight problem with the style of writing of this novel and felt it wasn't as good as the weird sisters as felt toned down"}, {"userName": "Kim Swartz", "userReviewDate": "Aug 07, 2017", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/55174117-kim-swartz", "userReview": "I wanted to like this book but the main character was so self-absorbed, insecure and whiny it was difficult to care about her."}, {"userName": "Mandy", "userReviewDate": "Mar 29, 2017", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/37864333-mandy", "userReview": "Wonderful book.

The two stories link together with ease with Madeleine and Margie brought to life within the 320 pages.In recent time Chicago, Madeleine goes through the daily chore of being at her husbands beck and call, forgetting what her own purpose in life is. After an argument she flees to her childhood home and is shocked to realise just how much she misses it. Helping her mother clear out the family home, she discovers her grandmothers journals and is transported back to 1920s Paris and all its post-war optimism. Art, music and literature are all part of Margie's new world and Madeleine begins to question her own purpose in life. An only child, who had always seemed a let-down to her mother, she now sees her hometown in a new light and is reluctant to return to a stale marriage and a soulless existence. There are parallels within the pages of her grandmothers journals. She too was not living up to her mothers expectations and felt that Paris could bring out the missing elements required to add much-needed joie de vivre to her life. Surrounded by artist, writers and musicians, she glimpses a new world. A world with opportunity, inspiration and freedom. Her love of Paris is deepened when she meets Sebastian, a french man who shows her around his world of relaxed and bohemian joy. How is a young woman, with stifling expectations chained around her neck, supposed to return to America after experiencing the joys of such an iconic city?Each protagonist has equal standing in this wonderful novel. The vastly different worlds they inhabit seem all too familiar, as they both struggle to choose their fate. The streets of Paris are brought to life with ease and the atmosphere of a new beginning in the aftermath of World War 1 is subtly woven through the prose. Margie is hesitant at first but soon falls under the spell of the French capital. In comparison, Madeleine is also unsure of her surroundings and has no real plan for her future. Both women are embraced by their different surroundings and change becomes a real possibility.  Eleanor Brown has introduced us to two women, from two different eras, linked by a timeless theme of change. She has breathed life into the streets of Paris and the outskirts of Chicago and added two strong women. Both characters are experiencing tentative changes in their lives and are linked by a family tree. This is a warm novel with witty dialogue and stunning descriptive passages. An easy read, you can find yourself immersed in the sights and sounds of Paris as you stroll along with Margie and Sebastian while suddenly sensing the shift back to Chicago and its structured restrictions. It would almost be a shame not to sit outside a bistro or cafe, with an obligatory glass of red, and slip into the worlds of these two women. Views of the Eiffel Tower are not essential..."}], "description": "The miraculous new novel from New York Times\u2013bestselling author Eleanor Brown, whose debut, The Weird Sisters, was a sensation beloved by critics and readers alike.\u00a0Madeleine is trapped\u2014by her family's expectations, by her controlling husband, and by her own fears\u2014in an unhappy marriage and a life she never wanted.
