Can\u2019t expect everyone to be on the same page. We\u2019re still humans after all. Some percentage of us are always going to be assholes.\u201d- Naomi Nagata - Nemesis Games\"Boy, that escalated quickly... I mean, that really got out of hand fast.\" - Ron Burgundy - Anchorman: The Legend of Run BurgundyAfter their latest misadventure the Rocinante is in need of extensive repairs that will keep the ship sidelined as the crew finds itself with a variety of personal matters that need their attention so they split up and head to different spots all over the solar system. Unfortunately, one of them gets caught up in an elaborate trap that will have a devastating and long-range impact.The Expanse novels have been about big events potentially changing the future of humanity, but these things have been done against a backdrop that fundamentally hasn\u2019t changed. The political and military organizations have remained mostly stable, and a large part of the story is about the reaction by those powers to what's going on. What happens here is particularly sneaky on the part of the authors who make up the James S.A. Corey name because this is the point where they\u2019ve kicked over the table and upset the entire game. That makes sense because by their 9 book timeline this is where we cross the halfway point so we\u2019re firmly in the second act which is where things traditionally get dark for the heroes of any kind of story. What\u2019s shocking here is the extent of the damage done, and it\u2019s made even more disturbing that even those who have generally been portrayed as being the most powerful and savviest characters get caught flat-footed. Once again, that makes sense in the greater context of The Expanse because one of its on-going themes is how short-sighted selfish people can always draw attention away from larger threats and find a way to fight over things even as humanity should be on the brink of a new age of limitless exploration and expansion. This is especially been built up as part of an increasingly good job of developing villains. At the start of the series the third party subjective nature of shifting the point-of-view around a handful of characters sometimes made the threats seem vague or to come out of nowhere. Since the third book the authors have done a much better job of finding ways to put a face on the bad guys, and they\u2019ve got a knack for creating a particular brand of smug self-absorbed jerkfaces who are masters of developing rationalizations for their actions.Another selling point here is that at this point in the series we\u2019re fully invested in our main characters. (Or at least I assume that anyone who is reading the 5th book of 500+ page novels cares at least a little bit about these guys.) By scattering the crew of the Roci around and making them the narrators who carry the story, it not only brings a lot of the epic scale down to a more relatable level, it also sets up a near guarantee in emotional investment. Even as they\u2019re going through different trails and tribulations they all have one goal, to get back to their ship and each other. That's the hook that carries off this whole thing because it's what all the readers want, too.I could nitpick a bit about how some of the coincidences seem a bit much or that the novella The Churn probably should have been boiled down to backstory for this one rather than selling it as a extra by itself. But overall I\u2019m just having too much fun with this series to gripe much other than bitching about how now I gotta wait until the summer of 2016 for the next book. I just hope I don\u2019t get Dark Towered on this thing\u2026."}, {"userName": "Hannah Greendale", "userReviewDate": "Jan 07, 2017", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/43377498-hannah-greendale", "userReview": "Nemesis Games offers a perfect blend of intimate character stories with a broad scale intergalactic adventure of epic proportions. The book takes about 200+ pages to establish the stakes before launching into one thrilling close call after another."}, {"userName": "Mogsy (MMOGC)", "userReviewDate": "Sep 15, 2014", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/4379514-mogsy-mmogc", "userReview": "5 of 5 stars at The BiblioSanctum http://bibliosanctum.com/2015/06/19/b...*Warning: May contain spoilers for previous books if you haven't read them* The Expanse is my favorite space opera series right now \u2013 the only space opera series that I\u2019m still following, to be honest, when I\u2019ve given up on so many others. Not only are things still going strong at book five, they also just keep getting better and better. I thought Cibola Burn was going to be the best installment we\u2019ll see for a while, but then along comes Nemesis Games, teaching me what a mistake it was to underestimate Daniel Abraham and Ty Franck, the writing team behind the pseudonym James S.A. Corey. Bottom line, this book was simply stellar.The reason why I think this series is so successful? Every book gives the reader something new. The universe of The Expanse is constantly evolving, with major consequences following in the wake of each installment. No longer are the stories simply focused around the mysterious proto-molecule introduced in Leviathan Wakes. Ever since it was released into the solar system in the third book Abaddon\u2019s Gate, opening a literal doorway to a thousand new worlds, the potential for more interesting stories has exploded.I see Abaddon\u2019s Gate as a turning point for this reason. And now I think Nemesis Games may be another one. The events of the last novel have not stopped the frantic land rush through the massive ring-like gates, as settlers fight tooth-and-nail to be the first to colonize new planets. This has created a drastic change in the power structure of the old solar system, where three main factions exist: Earth, Mars, and the Outer Planets Alliance. OPA was mainly formed to bring together the population born in the Asteroid Belt. Called \u201cBelters\u201d, they are an oppressed group, marginalized and frequently discriminated for their distinct culture and language, as well as for looking physically different from the humans from Earth and Mars. But recently, Belters have started to resist the powers of the inner planets, and one extremist group has gone as far as to target Earth in catastrophic attack, killing millions upon millions.In the middle of this mess, the crew of the Rocinante are separated. The decision to go on shore leave right after surviving the events of Cibola Burn meant that Holden, Naomi, Amos and Alex were all in different places when the attack on Earth occurred, so for the first time in this series the four of them aren\u2019t together for the majority of the novel. Before you get too disappointed though, this turn of events also means that for the first time ever, we get perspective chapters for every member of the crew.I can\u2019t tell you how excited this made me. I\u2019ve been waiting a long, long time to see the points-of-view for the others besides Holden \u2013 especially for Naomi, the only female and the only Belter of the Rocinante crew. It\u2019s hard to believe that it took so long, but after four books, we\u2019re finally getting the chance to get up close and personal to characters we\u2019ve been following since the beginning. But that\u2019s not all, either. The authors continue to sweeten the deal, bringing back some perspective characters we\u2019ve seen in previous books, familiar names that include Bobbie Draper, Clarissa Mao, and \u2013 wait for it \u2013 Chrisjen Avasarala! (Best. Character. Ever.) While none of them return as POV characters, all three women have significant roles to play in Nemesis Games.I\u2019ve also said before that the books of The Expanse tell very human stories. This one is no exception. Separated in the wake of the Earth attack and in the midst of all the death and suffering, the four members of the crew realize how much they mean to each other. It\u2019s very touching as each character struggles to find their way back together, realizing that the spaceship Rocinante has become a home for their little family. During their individual fights for survival, we gain a lot of insight into each person\u2019s past. Naomi\u2019s backstory is perhaps the most surprising of all, and also the most heartbreaking. Every book in this series so far has had four character perspectives each, and one always seems to stand out for me above the rest. No question about it, in Nemesis Games it was definitely Naomi\u2019s. As much as I enjoyed Amos and Alex\u2019s POVs as well, I just couldn\u2019t get enough of Naomi\u2019s chapters, which really brought her courage and resourcefulness to the forefront.The book ends with a promise of much more to come, including possible new additions to the Rocinante family, which would be very interesting to see. It doesn\u2019t quite leave us with a cliffhanger, though we do get the sense of unfinished business, so you can bet I\u2019m on board for book number six.All told, The Expanse shows no sign of slowing down, a great sign for a series that is planned to include a total of nine books, and I\u2019m grateful that thus far we\u2019ve been seeing a very reliable release schedule of one installment per year. With the TV adaptation coming to Syfy, now there\u2019s yet another reason to get excited. Nemesis Games is the last novel to come out before the series airs, so get on it!"}, {"userName": "Rob", "userReviewDate": "Sep 26, 2014", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/10743961-rob", "userReview": "Executive Summary: Best one yet! I've always enjoyed this series, but I really loved this book. My only complaint would I don't have more to read! I can't wait for book 6.Audio book: Jefferson Mays is back! Huzzah! Don't get me wrong, he's not one of my favorite narrators or anything, but he is good. And the guy they got to replace him for book 4 was not. I was considering switching to text for this book if that narrator was used again. Thankfully I didn't have to. His accents for Avasarala and Alex are excellent as always. Everyone else isn't really anything special. He has good inflection and reads in a nice and clear voice. Hopefully they'll be able to get him for all the future books.\nFull Review\nThe Expanse books have been a lot of fun since I finally picked them up last year. However I was starting to feel like maybe it was running out of steam.I liked Leviathan Wakes and thought Caliban's War was even better. However I felt Abaddon's Gate and especially Cibola Burn weren't as good.I've grown tired of the rotating POV's with new characters to follow around. Part of the problem is that Avasarala and Bobbie were so great in Caliban's War, everyone that followed was a disappointment.Not only that, but they didn't really feature in books 3 and 4 and I think that's a waste. Thankfully that's been remedied in this book. While they aren't POV characters again, they do feature fairly heavily in the plot, albeit Bobbie moreso than Avasarala.The other problem was I always found at least 1 or 2 of the POV to be less interesting than the others. The best part is that instead of forcing the readers to deal with some new characters they won't like as much, they chose to make the other 3 POVs the remaining members of the Rocinante. Not only do we finally get in the heads of characters I've come to love in the last 4 books, but we get more of their backstories as well, especially Naomi and Amos. In fact if you haven't read The Churn previously, I'd highly recommend doing so before this novel. I think you'll get a lot more out of Amos's storyline if you do. I'm hard pressed to pick a favorite plotline. They were all just so good.So apart from excellent choice for POVs what really makes this book so great is the focus of the story. The stuff with the protomolecule in the last 4 books has been interesting, but this book mostly takes a break from that.The tensions have long been bubbling between the 3 human factions of Earth, Mars and The Belt/OPA have finally come to a head. And just when I thought I was enjoying this book, BAM! It somehow got even better.This is a very different story than last four. That may upset some fans, but for me it breathed new life into a series that seemed in danger of losing its way.Some characters in this book made me so mad! Others made me scared or nervous. Just seeing Bobbie and Avasarala made me happy. I hated having to stop listening each day, and I couldn't wait to start listening again. To me that's the sort of thing that pushes something from a 4 star rating into the vary rare company of a 5 star rating. It also put it solidly on my favorites shelf. I will definitely be listening to this one again.If I had one complaint it's that it's over! I can't wait for book 6! If you found yourself not as happy with the last book or two, I highly recommend giving this one a shot, I really think it's best one yet!"}, {"userName": "Ashley", "userReviewDate": "Feb 10, 2015", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/1343864-ashley", "userReview": "First, a warning: I have officially passed the point of objectivity for this series. You know you\u2019ve passed that point when you no longer care what happens in a book series as long as you get to spend more time in its world hanging out with its characters. This isn\u2019t a place I get to easily, but once I\u2019m there, I never ever leave. Love, it is irrational.With that said, oh boy, this book was awesome. In retrospect, one of my favorite things about each book in the series is how different each one of them are to each other. They\u2019re all essentially told with the same style and tone, but Corey* wastes no time languishing in story plots. His characters evolve. Things in his world change, most often in ways that are terrifying and wonderful, in the most basic sense of the word: full-of-wonder. There\u2019s always a moment in each book that Things Change Forever. And in this one, that thing is probably the biggest thing of them all, and it\u2019s even more exhilarating because if you\u2019ve read the four books prior to this one, you are likely very attached emotionally to the characters experiencing these world-changing events.*A penname for writing duo Daniel Abraham and Ty Franck.This book also brings us POVs from all the four main crew members of the Rocinante for the very first time. We\u2019ve always had Holden in there, but now we get Naomi, Alex, and Amos up in there, too. And with their POVs comes much needed backstory on all of them, especially Naomi. Hoooooo, Naomi. By the end of the first chapter, you know what\u2019s coming in terms of what I\u2019m about to spoil, so I\u2019m not really counting it as spoilers. The Roci is so beat up from her years of space travel, and particularly her last voyage through the proto-molecule gate, she\u2019s going to need serious revamping and repairs. It\u2019s going to take weeks, months. So the crew split up for some \u201cshore leave.\u201d Amos receives news that his foster mother has died on Earth, so he takes off to take care of things. Alex follows his lead and heads home to Mars, and Naomi heads back to Ceres station after a mysterious message from a man from her past. So, when the trademark Horrific Thing happens, we are in a unique position to get lots of different viewpoints on it, and of course, Holden and Co. are right smack dab in the middle of everything.I loved this book. I love this crew. It was so satisfying. It was terrifying and horrible and I never wanted to stop listening to it. It makes me want to re-read the first two books to see if I will love them more now. It makes me want book six* PRONTO.*If you decide to start reading this series, know you are in safe hands. They release a new book every year like clockwork.So, bottom line, this book was awesome, but you maybe can\u2019t trust my opinion because love is irrational. But you probably should anyway because I have excellent taste.[4.5 stars]"}, {"userName": "Gary", "userReviewDate": "Dec 14, 2017", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/30706026-gary", "userReview": "The most nerve-wracking Expanse novel yet sees the crew of the Rocinante separate for a variety of personal reasons during some down time for ship repairs. Slowly, they find themselves drawn back together as a strange conspiracy morphs into a shocking, game-changing event.This time, each of the Roci crew has their own POV storyline, instead of the usual cycling through a new cast of supporting characters. The opportunity to take an even closer look at these people we\u2019ve come to love (instead of always seeing them through other characters\u2019 eyes) is the best kind of reward for being a devoted reader of this series.

They have a ship in orbit called the Pella that releases tungsten slugs to take out the Martian ships in orbit, as well as the Martian marines in power armor on the surface. The team suffers a few casualties but manages to escape with their loot--just as their ship launches a rock into the moon.A year after the Callisto attack, 6 days after they got back from Ilus, the crew of the Rocinante arrive at Tycho for repairs--the new chief engineer Sakai (R.I.P. Sam) estimates they'll take around 6 months. Alex doesn't like how he left things with his ex-wife (they were happily married and had their own place after he left the MCRN, but he wanted to keep flying) and plans to visit her on Mars. Amos needs to head back to Earth because a woman he knows (Lydia, the face of whom he has tattooed on his chest) has died. Naomi wants to hire more crew since in case anything happens to any of them. She gets a call from someone in the OPA telling here that Filip is in trouble.Fred tells Holden that he's headed to Medina Station, as that's where all the power is. He and Avasarala are back-channeling a lot of the dealings, but Fred's concerned about all the offshoot branches of the OPA; with all the new planets, life on the space stations is going to die out, but the Belters aren't all physically capable of living on the planets. Apart from Callisto, they made an attempt at attacking Earth as well.Namoi tells Jim that she needs to go to Ceres, alone, and that he needs to let her go or they'll have to break up. She leaves, and Holden is completely alone for the first time in years. Later, he gets a call from journalist Monica Stuart, who is also on Tycho, and she asks to meet up. Over dinner, she shows him a video of a freighter that went through one of the rings and then disappeared.Alex visits his wife Talissa when he gets to Mars, but she angrily tells him to go. He gives Bobbie Draper a ring to see if she wants to meet up, and she agrees.Upon arriving in New York, Amos is promptly \"arrested\" and taken to an interogation room at the police station. Chrisjen Avasarala greets him via TV monitor and asks him what the fuck he's doing on Earth, if Holden sent his \"hired killer\" to take out Murtry or something. Once he assures her he's there on a personal errand, he's free to go. Amos looks up Lydia's obituary and finds that her husband Charles was the last to see her alive; Amos goes to meet him.Monica informs Holden that the Rabia Balkhi is only 1 of 13 ships that have disappeared after going through one of the Rings, and no one is talking about it. She somehow knows about Fred's sample of protomolecule and wants to use it to consult proto-Miller; Holden says no way, and thinks maybe the OPA is involved in the disappearances. He broaches his theory with Fred, who tells him \"no way\" and that he should drop it.On Ceres, Naomi meets up with an old friend, a massive Belter called Cyn, who takes her to see Filip, Naomi's son to Marco Inaro. Naomi left Marco after he used a program she wrote to sabotage the fusion reactor on the ship August\u00edn Gamarra, killing 234 people; this was the initial OPA rebellion, after the UN shut down the proposed Belter homeworld, Terryon Lock, in the Jovian system. Afterwards, she tried to kill herself. Marco told her to leave and not to come looking for him or Filip.Filip wanted her to bring the Roci to take to the Hungaria cluster where they have a ship called the Pella. With the Roci still being repaired, she charters a ship covertly with Outer Fringe Export (who Holden had almost taken a job for back before they went through the Ring).Amos heads to Philly and meets up with Lydia's widowed husband, Charles, who turns out to have been an OK guy that truly loved her--so Amos doesn't kill him. Charles knows Amos as Timothy, and Lydia was Timothy's surrogate mother after his biological mother died. Charles says that with Lydia gone, he can no longer afford the house, which was being floated by some gangster named Erich.Amos goes to visit Erich in Baltimore; Erich used to be a small time hacker, he has one tiny little arm and one regular one, and is now running the streets that he and Amos used to work. Erich says he treated Lydia very well, but Amos insists he take care of Charles too. Erich agrees, so Amos says he won't kill him. Erich is grateful, but tells him there was a flechette turret hidden in the ceiling. Before Amos leaves Earth, he calls Avasarala and asks her to let him see Clarissa Mao, who he became fond of when they escorted her as a prisoner.Alex goes to visit Bobbie. She's been investigating the sources of black market military equipment leaving Mars for Avasarala, and she asks Alex if he'll help her by talking to some of his buddies in the MCRN; he says he'll think about it. Before he leaves Mars, he visits Bobbie again one more time with the intention of telling her \"no, he can't help\", only to find a small group of men have broken into her house and tied her up. He calls for emergency services, then rushes in to save her. He gets stabbed and she gets shot, but they survive. Bobbie tells him the men were there looking for him. He says he'll stay and help her.Holden pays a \"data wonk\" called Paula Gutierrez to write him a program to find any ships that may be suspicious. When he tells Monica, she's upset that he's brought Fred, Sakai, and Paula in on the investigation, especially since they're all OPA. The next day, he gets a hit on a ship called the Pau Kant located in the Hungaria asteroid group that is relatively close to Earth and Mars. He calls Alex and asks him to check it out before he comes back, then tries to track down Monica again--but her room on Tycho has been ransacked and she's missing. He warns Fred that he's got OPA radicals on the station.Alex and Bobbie make it to the hospital and survive their respective surgeries. Bobbie reasons she was attacked because via the Roci, Alex is involved with Mars, Fred (OPA), and Avasarala (UN). Bobbie says that while the Donnager class warships are well tracked, the corvettes they carried were less so, and with all the battles lately, they were turning up and disappearing quite a bit if you looked at the data properly. Someone high up in the Navy would have to be involved for the level of clearance required in overwriting the records; that's what she wants Alex to look in to, while she looks into who hired their attackers. Alex gets Holden's message about checking on the ship in the Hungarian cluster; Bobbie says Avasarala gave her Julie Mao's ship, the Razorback, and that he can use it.Holden and Fred check the security footage and see 2 guys (not in Tycho's system) in jumpsuits and caps go into Monica's room and leave with a shipping crate. They go to the dock and find the crate but it's empty, meaning someone must've edited the security footage. Fred puts the station on lockdown. Back in Monica's quarters, Holden finds that her phone seems to be receiving a signal from the hidden camera she wears for interviews. They track her to a sealed cargo crate and find her inside, drugged and tied-up, but mostly unharmed.Alex meets with one of his MCRN buddies who hooks him up with a Commander Duarte; he too has noticed the missing ships, even the same one Alex is tracking, the Apalala. Duarte tells him that the tracking of supplies, ships, and material has collapses and they have no idea what all they're missing. He tells Alex to meet up with a programmer named Karlo that first noticed the discrepancies in the database; Alex goes to his place only to find him dead. Alex asks Bobbie to go check out the asteroid Holden told him about, and she agrees to come with him.Fred gets in touch with Anderson Dawes, another OPA bigwig, who points him towards chief engineer Sakai. Fred interrogates Sakai, who spills that he was involved; he skirted around Fred because he's racist against Earthers, even if Fred is OPA through and through. Fred punches him out and throws him in the brig.The ship Naomi purchased is called the Chetzemoka. When it's ready to board, she pulls Filip aside and tells him she can't come along on their mission, but that she wants him to have the ship, and that afterwards, there's a spot for him on the Roci if he wants to come with her. The giant guy, her friend Cyn, puts Naomi in a bearhug while Karal sticks her with a needle full of sedatives.When they get near the Hungaria cluster, Alex realizes that they're being painted with a targeting laser. He makes some scans himself and gets ping after ping of Martian corvette class ships running dark. The ships let loose a couple of missiles and Alex takes off at 10gs towards Luna, where the Martian Prime Minister has a convoy, hoping they can make it in time for the PM's ships' PDC cannons to take out the missiles. Alex kicks it up to 15gs and it rips the wound open in his stomach. Before he passes out, he jettisons the core and it crashes into the first of the missiles; the Martian PDCs take out the other.Naomi is taken to the Martian corvette where Marco is. He tells her he brought her there to keep her safe, because she's one of them--but she's pretty sure he really just wanted the Roci. Ostensibly, the attack they're planning is because the Earthers are abandoning their entire race to die, since Belters can't survive in planetary gravity. A racing ship arrives at their location (the Razorback) and Marco says to destroy them. Naomi is locked up and forced to watch the newsfeed of Marco's assault on Earth.While Amos is in the waiting room to see Clarissa Mao, the news reports that an asteroid hit somewhere in South Africa, causing tremendous damage. Guards take Amos to Clarissa's underground cell, and he tells her about all that's happened with the Roci since they dropped her off. In the middle of his story, the place goes on lockdown; a guard tells them that multiple other accelerated rocks have impacted around the globe, causing massive destruction worldwide. The rocks were undetected because they were coated with stealth coating.On Tycho, Fred and Holden are watching the news when 3 people enter the office and start shooting. Fred is hit, but he and Holden manage to kill/fend off their attackers; however, the station's defense grid is disabled and someone fires torpedoes at them. One torpedo hits and cracks the drive cone. Fred and Drummer coordinate an attack on the intruders in engineering and regain control of the station. A second torpedo with a salvage mech on the end impacts Fred's office; it escapes with the protomolecule sample.Amos convinces the guards they need to get out of the prison before the building collapses, and they reluctantly agree. With the help of a prisoner called Konecheck, who has enhanced strength like Clarissa's, they manage to crawl up the elevator shaft to the surface. Konecheck kills a few of the guards and injures Amos before Mao shoots him and Amos kicks him down the elevator shaft. The surface is totally devastated and the sky is so dark with debris that Clarissa mistakes the sun for the moon. Amos suggests they walk to Baltimore because he knows some people that can get him to Luna.Naomi tells Filip that after Marco made her kill, she wanted to kill herself; she tells him to come find her when the remorse of killing a quarter billion people sets in. He tells her she's merde to him.Alex and Bobbie meet with the Martian Prime Minister Smith while they convalesce. They debrief for hours; mostly the Martians are glad Alex and Bobbie intercepted the hidden fleet, or things could've been even worse; they're still a bit suspicious though. Six and a half relief ships are en route; one of them is the Chetzemoka however, the ship Namoi gave to Filip.Fred Johnson asks Holden to take him to a meeting on Luna with the Martian PM and Avasarala, who is now head of the UN. Fred plays Holden a message he got from Anderson Dawes, asking Fred to join with the new faction of the OPA; Holden is appalled, but Johnson is actually considering it--that's the side that's in charge now, and Fred can't decide if he should declare against them or stand beside them and help control the fall. Medina Station goes dark, and Drummer reports 25 Martian ships are en route to it.Naomi asks Marco if he brought her aboard just to show off; he reiterates that he brought her there to save her, and to get closure. She insists it's because he's jealous of Holden, which infuriates him and he says he might kill Holden. She says he can't do anything to Jim, and he tells her that maybe she will. She pieces things together and realizes Sakai must've used her sabotaged the reactor driver on the Roci.Amos and Peaches (aka Clarissa Mao) kill some doomsday prepper and load up on weapons, supplies, and a couple of bicycles. They walk to Baltimore and meet up with Erich, then proposition him to go to Luna with them, by way of a private launch pad on Lake Winnipesaukee. At first he's incredulous that they'd ask him to abandon his territory, but when Peaches breaks his wall of denial and he realizes he's got nothing left, he agrees.Alex, Bobbie, and the Martian PM are forced to flee their Martian convoy in the Razorback when the relief ships turn out to be OPA-controlled; they attack and board the Martian ships without much resistance. The Razorback, accompanied by about 100 Martian missiles flying in tandem alongside them, make for Luna with the OPA ships in pursuit.During the battle with the MCRN convoy, Naomi breaks into an access panel and broadcasts a message to Holden warning him that the Roci's fusion driver has been sabotaged with bad code. Marco tells her that since she sabotaged his plan, which was only to shut the Roci down, not destroy it, that now she's forced his hand. He plays her a faked distress call in her voice, asking Holden to come save her. On the way back to her cell, she stops at the med bay and starts a kerfuffle there, during which she manages to pocket an emergency decompression kit, which should cycle the airlock on the Chetzemoka.Holden gets Naomi's message just in time; they shut down the drive at 60% and reload a new driver. His hired programmer Paula finds the bad lines of code in the sabotaged driver and tells him that when the reactor hit 95% it would've lost containment and taken most of Tycho Station with it. She realizes this could've been what happened during all the reactor accidents in the past, meaning they were all murders. Holden, Fred, and a crew of Tycho workers depart in the Roci, leaving Drummer in charge of Tycho.Marco issues a statement from the Pella, declaring himself the commander of the Free Navy and saying that Mars and Earth no longer control anything outside their respective planets. He calls for everyone from the Belt and the outer planets to rise up and follow them.Amos, Erich, Peaches, et. al make their way to the Lake where the shuttles are. They find one named the Zhang Guo, but it needs repaired, and there's a tribe of people trying to shake them down; Amos beats the shit out of one of them, then Amos et. al. start repairing the shuttle. Just as they're doing final testing on it, the tribe returns with many more people and many more guns. Amos's group manages to stave them off long enough to launch the shuttle. They successfully make it past the Luna patrol defenses after Amos name-drops Avasarala. Erich offers to let him run the crew, since he's now totally out of his element, but Amos just wants to get back to the Roci. Clarissa is afraid they're going to send her back to jail, but he assures her that there is no jail to go back to.On the Pella, Naomi escapes from her handler and makes it to an airlock, intending to escape to the Chetzemoka without an EVA suit. Her buddy Cyn comes after her, thinking she's going to space herself, but she sorrowfully blows the airlock anyway, killing him--and hopefully convincing the others she died as well. She just barely makes it to the other ship in time and opens the airlock with the emergency decompression kit she stole earlier. She finds that the ship has been mostly stripped bare, all access panels are locked, it's broadcasting a faked message saying she's aboard and needs help, and it's set to blow if anyone gets close to it. She starts pulling wires and turns one of the thrusters off, making her go in circles; she also short circuits the faked message, making it say \"this is Naomi Nagata and I am--in control.\"Alex gets Naomi's message and takes the Razorback to cautiously investigate. With no way to communicate, Naomi exits the ship through the airlock in a suit with only 5 minutes of air; she uses Belter hand signals so they know not to get close to the ship. Bobbie uses the mag-boots on her power armor to ride one of the Razorback's missiles like a surf board and successfully rescues Naomi. Once safely aboard, Naomi tells them to blow up the damn ship.Holden rendezvous with the Razorback and immediately gets Naomi to the medbay, since she's suffering from space exposure and plenty of other traumas. They all make it back to Luna and meet up with Amos, who smuggles Clarissa Mao onto the Roci in a cargo container.Avasarala calls them all together for an announcement: She's going to start a policing task force against the Free Navy, with joint support from the UN, Mars, and the OPA. Naomi is brought in as a prisoner, and agrees to cooperate and tell everything about Marco if she and the crew of the Roci are given immunity for past events not related to the attack on Earth. Avasarala agrees, and they all go for chow. Naomi and Holden head back to their room and she opens up to him about everything. They exchange their pieces of the story in almost casual, conversational tones then fall asleep together.When Naomi wakes up, she watches the video of the ship that disappeared entering the Ring, the Rabia Balkhi, and wonders what happened to all the civilian ships, since Marco had only acquired MCRN ships. She comes to the conclusion that something in the ring gate is eating the ships.In the epilogue, the Free Navy is confirmed to have control of Medina Station, and are commandeering civilian ships. Admiral Duarte of the MCRN has taken control of the remaining Martian military ships in an independent initiative of the fleet, ostensibly working with the Free Navy but planning to attack them from the rearguard later. Duarte appears to have the protomolecule sample and another much larger alien artifact. A Donnager class ship called the Barkeith goes through the Laconia ring; the crew experience a sensation like they are clouds and can see the spaces between atoms. A solid, fog-like alien presence appears on the ship and kills the crew."}, {"userName": "Tom Merritt", "userReviewDate": "Jun 02, 2015", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/93524-tom-merritt", "userReview": "I loved getting the perspectives from each of the view of the Rocinante.

No offense, but your track record for blurting information at inopportune moments is the stuff of legend.\u201d ...\" \nOK, this was awesome!!! I think after the short story \"The Churn\", which was all about how Amos got to be who he is and where he is, this is my favorite book of the series so far!!! It was everything you want from a Science Fiction + Space Opera + Drama!!! And none of that manufactured stuff either, it was all plot and characterization, pure entertainment gold! It is great to be back with the crew of the Rocinante, Amos, Alex, Naomi and of course, our none-too-bright but earnest and lovable Earther James Holden. He seemed to be in particularly good shape this time around:):):)\n\"... \u201cWhat did you do?\u201d Fred asked. \u201cThere was a button,\u201d Holden said. \u201cI pushed it.\u201d \u201cJesus Christ. That really is how you go through life, isn\u2019t it?\u201d ...\" \nYep, that is our Holden, who somehow, miraculously is still alive and has build a reputation for himself and his crew, as the guy who is always in the middle of things and comes out on the right side of every conflict. That has brought a ton of popularity and quite undeserved hero worship or hatred, depending on the point of view, for a dude that speaks and acts before he thinks. Making things worse is the fact that his shipmates are loyal and love each-other like a family, so they all feel like they have to follow in his footsteps and have his back, thus getting themselves constantly in trouble on his behalf... \n\"...\u201cHere\u2019s the thing,\u201d Amos said. \u201cIf you did go in there, you might feel like you had to do something. And then I might feel like I had to do something. And then we\u2019d all be doing things, and we\u2019d all wind up having a worse day, just in general.\u201d ...\" \nWell, after couple of rough years, the Rocinante is in the shop for repairs and it will take months to get her back into shape. The crew is restless and it seems all of them see their vacation time differently. Alex goes back to Mars to see if he can have a closure with his ex, Amos goes back to Earth after receiving the news of a close person having passed away, and Naomi receives a mysterious com from some Belter dude named Marcus and takes off for places unknown, asking Holden to let her keep it private until she comes back. All three promise they will be back, but this brings on strong the fact that the crew is less than bare bones and they need to hire at least couple of more people. However, first, they have to deal with their problems separately and we get to see all four POV's and what they go through. I loved that!!! \n\"...\u201cAlien super-weapons were used,\u201d Alex said, walking into the room, sleep-sweaty hair standing out from his skull in every direction. \u201cThe laws of physics were altered, mistakes were made.\u201d ...\" \nA very militant wing of the Belter Uprising start a series of atrocities toward not only Earth, but Mars and all establishment, including the Belter OP, and of course our gang, though separately, get in the middle of the problem. The situation also involves the best UN politician with the worst potty-mouth, Avasarala, her counterpart on the Belt and Holden's off-and-on friend Fred Johnson, and our favorite Martian Marine - Bobbie is back!!!! I love all of them so much, it was such a treat having them once again ready to rumble:) No one puts things in such a colorful and memorable way as our grandmotherly UN politician!\n\"...\u201cAlso, Nathan, if you\u2019re listening, and I assume you are, I\u2019m the best and only friend you\u2019ve got. Give her permission to share what she has, or I swear to God I\u2019ll have you turning tricks out of a prefab shed on the side of the highway. I\u2019m trying to save humanity here.\u201d ...\" \nAs much as I enjoyed the humor, most of this book concerns some hard self-explorations by all of our heroes, as well as really horrible losses for humanity. At times I was left feeling like no matter how many brilliant things Humanity comes up with, we will always find reasons and ways to hurt, humiliate, or annihilate each-other, and this is just so very depressing... Since things got really bad here, I cannot wait to see what the authors do with the follow-up, since things are left very bleak by the end of this book... I am so tempted to just go straight into the next one, but I know I have to pace myself, or book burn-out is sure to follow... \n\"...\u201cCan\u2019t expect everyone to be on the same page. We\u2019re still humans after all. Some percentage of us are always going to be assholes.\u201d ...\" \nI would recommend this series to all fans of Science Fiction and good, exciting, heart-thumping entertainment all together.

I got sucked back into the characters as if I had never left and was delighted to see that they shone brighter than in several of the previous novels. They're back in the Solar System. The main crew got a hell of a lot of face time. If it isn't enough that this qualifies as a wonderful character driven adventure, then rest assured. It's still all about the big ideas, big events, and big space. The pacing is near perfect on this one. I never once had to force myself to pay closer attention. Indeed, the revelations kept everything pumping. Every character is evolving, growing older or wiser. The novel has struck a perfect balance in this. Hell, I'm just tickled pink that it turned out to be a better novel than Cibola Burn. There weren't any moments where I wondered why we were spending time on one thing or another instead of the big action. The threads in this novel were woven so nicely that I swear I saw a bow. What was inside, you ask? Oh, Bobby is back! And don't forget Fred or our absolute favorite foul-mouthed politician. It was a perfect gift for me, the reader, and I've got to shout out to Daniel and Ty: \"Thank you!\"This is fifth novel in the Expanse is so very worthy, I have to say it easily nudges out the third and forth novels in being my favorites, but it does somewhat lack in the sense of grand mystery that those had developed. I mean the grand scope of mystery, the big scary objects, or the ominous death of so many intelligent species. Instead, we've got very human tragedy and a very interesting power grab in the local system, not to mention mysteries closer to home for our main characters which feel more important, somehow, than the mind-blowing ones.I can easily say this satisfied my deep craving for truly excellent space opera. So many tend to have holes that that suck my attention into the void, requiring me to spend a ton of reaction mass to get back on track.

I was extremely happy to see my concerns obliterated and my faith in this series more than restored.My biggest problem with the last book was that it felt very claustrophobic. I mean, the series is called \nExpanse\n, but Cibola Burn mostly took place on one planet, nothing like the solar system (and beyond) spanning stories the first three books encompassed. Nemesis Games remedies this by \"breaking up the band\", sending Naomi, Alex, and Amos off to take care of some of their own business while their ship undergoes extensive repairs. This accomplishes two excellent things:1) Character development: another of my criticisms of Cibola Burn was the lack of character development. The main cast showed no change from the beginning of the book to the end. They were the kick ass good guys who kicked ass and did good. Sure it is entertaining, but it was not as rich in characterization as the previous installments. With Alex, Amos, and Naomi heading off to take care of some of their own business we get more of their backstory and their internal thought process. I thought this was particularly effective in Naomi's case. We already know her as an amazing engineer and independent woman but as we learn about her past (which very much informs contemporary events) and her battles with depression; she really becomes a much more fleshed out and deep character.2) Multiple Perspectives of Solar System Events: Nemesis Games returns us to events that span and affect the entire solar system. Instead of the POV characters all in one place reacting to the same information at the same time, each of the POV characters gets information at different times and have to overcome different challenges. It both shows each of their individuals strengths and highlights how important that they are to each other as a crew. The split of the crew also lets us to see some great characters from past books: Fred Johnson, Avasarala, and Bobbie. All in all the splitting of the crew and POV's really gave the story a much richer feel and context.Another great part of Nemesis Games was the antagonist. One of the underlying themes of this series is the tension between the planetary societies (Earth and Mars) and the Belters (people who live and operate in low gravity environments in the asteroid belt and moons). Before the series starts there is a history of Belters being exploited by Earth and Martian companies and governments. Lack of supplies, high fees/taxes, disregard for Belter welfare, etc. Generally a very tense relationship with extremists on both sides, but because both sides provides some benefits to the other a relationship worth preserving and improving......At least until the opening of the gates to a thousand new worlds. Where certain minerals and substances came from the Belt, the new alien worlds offer an alternative and possible more stable/cheaper source of those substances. As such there is a large worry among Belters that they will simply be left behind as the rest of humanity expands to planets that, due to their adaptation for low gravity environments, Belters would be unable to take part in. Further, Belters have evolved into a unique society and identity independent of Earth and Martian origins. They see this exodus of humanity to the new worlds as a direct threat to their culture and way of life.Into this volatile mix, a group of Belter terrorist due some pretty terrible things in a terrifyingly effective and coordinated manner. I don't want to spoil much, but I will say the terrorists are scary competent and have a devastatingly effective plan to sow the seeds of chaos and destruction. And lurking in the background (as is the nature of Expanse books) is the protomolecule and some greater conspiracy that may just be using the Belter terrorists as a convenient tool for some greater plan that has yet to be revealed.The only slight, minor issue I had with the book was that this was more like the first half of a larger story. The conclusion leaves a lot of loose ends that need to be dealt with plus further mysteries about the gates themselves. But that does nothing to diminish this highly addictive and engaging read. Can't wait for the sixth book!And, because I guess it is something I do, some of my favorite passages form the book:Yes, but think of the huge tracts of land:\"But not all 1,300 systems have good surveys yet. Who knows what we'll find.\"\"Killer robot things and continent sized fusion reactors just waiting for someone to flip the switch so they can blow half the planet into space, if memory serves.\" Avasarla is still, literally, the best: \"Either I'm not in any trouble or I am in all of it. How you doin', Chrissie?\" \"Good to see you too. Call me that again and I'll have an officer beat you gently with a cattle prod.\"It is important to pace yourself, professionally speaking: \"I made my name with the story on the Behemoth. Aliens and wormhole gates and a protomolecule ghost that only talked to the most famous person in the solar system. I don't think my follow-up to that can be \"Humans Still Shitty to Each Other\". Lacks panache.\"James Holden's ancestors must have reproduced very quickly: \"What did you do?\" \"There was a button. I pushed it.\"\"Jesus Christ. That really is how you go through life, isn't it?\" I would watch the hell out of the Fred and Holden Show (as long as Avasarla guest starred): \"I've been trying to reach your hand terminal for the past fifteen minutes.\" \"I may have left it in my pants. In my quarters. I think I did.\" \"Are you drunk?\" \"I think I am.\" \"And you're not wearing any pants?\" \"I'm not ready to take our relationship there yet.\""}, {"userName": "Lata", "userReviewDate": "Jan 17, 2018", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/13126933-lata", "userReview": "4.5 stars.

Nope. The Expanse delivers again! Holden, Burton, Nagata, Kamal, and all the rest are back ... and so is the tension that the author has managed to keep at a high pitch over five books. Impressive. Holden and company return from New Terra and split up - each pursuing some personal, somewhat hidden agenda. The break up of the company leaves Holden morose and struggling. His crew had become his family, and he misses them - all of them. As a reader, I appreciated the break up as it allowed for character development. The crew sometimes felt as if they were part of the background when compared to Holden's monopolization of the lime light. Now, we get to learn the backstories of Nagata, Burton and Kamal. Of course, it wouldn't be the Expanse if we weren't learning about those backstories in the midst of all hell breaking loose. A rogue force is working in the shadows to destabilize the existing power structure. Holden and his crew once again manages to find himself at the center of things, but it was nice that it wasn't all about Holden. For a change he is in the background. My two favorite narratives in this volume were Burton's and Nagata's.The crisis itself is well done. Without revealing more it is something that generates a strong reaction. I genuinely didn't see it coming, but when the first hit happened, I instantly knew what was afoot. And despite the fact that the crisis at first seems straight forward, I appreciate the fact that their is still, lurking in the shadows questions and hints of darker motives. Plots within plots. I like that.Four and a half stars rounded up to five. My only wish is that I want the author to get to the point. I'm worried that I am looking at a Wheel of Time series here - one that just never ends.

But first, the good: We're back to big spaces and high stakes, which is enjoyable after the sometimes claustrophobic fourth book in the series. It's more my speed. My favourite characters return, which is also pretty great. The earth-shattering events are handled deftly, and we see enough characters react to them that you can probably find your likely response in there somewhere. The ending, as usual, ties things up neatly while leaving hooks for the next book. MAJOR SPOILERS FROM HERE ON IN. NO, SERIOUSLY. HUGE SPOILERS. Frustration #1: Naomi's ex is Space Hitler. Frustration #2: Naomi has now spent two books in a row being a prisoner. I'll elaborate on those a little. (Side note: I can't believe that 1) the word \"genocide\" doesn't appear in the book, and 2) no one mentions Hitler, even when Fred is describing what he knows about Marco and more or less describes Hitler.)More importantly, though, Naomi's characterization in this book is approximately one hundred percent defined by how she relates to male characters. Marco says she needs to go help her son and she abandons everything; Marco lays a trap to kill Jim and she moves heaven and earth to stop it. I'd hoped that Naomi's deep dark secret would be something unrelated to her gender or past relationships. \"I was a terrorist\" is a great dark secret. \"My ex is Space Hitler and he can still manipulate me into doing stuff\" doesn't add to the first secret; I think it actually detracts. On the plus side, Naomi is intelligent and resorceful, and in both cases of book-length imprisonment she escapes on her own rather than being rescued. But for me, that wasn't enough to overcome my issues with the rest of her arc in the book. Hopefully, though, we're past that now and can carry on with the good stuff. Only four books left, so I'm expecting the alien revelations to start flowing a little faster now. Yes, Earth got blown up. But let's not put too fine a point on it: that was GENocide, and we know the things that perpetrated the XENocide of the protomolecule creators are still out there. The stakes are a lot bigger than Earth. Some spoilery good stuff: Everything involving Amos was awesome. Alex was also pretty great in this one.

As this is undoubtedly my favorite science fiction series, I don\u2019t think that a fully unbiased review is possible. But then again, this is my review, so I suppose I can write it any way I please. So yeah, a glowing review it shall be\u2026Nemesis Games essentially begins right where Cibola Burn left off, so if you finished that book a while ago, as I did, you may have to engage your memory banks to recall all of the major plot points. Also, it must be noted that a few other characters and plot threads from the other books in the series make appearances here as well, to the benefit of the story. I won\u2019t spoil anything by mentioning them in any detail, but suffice to say they help tie this latest book into the larger Expanse universe as a whole. Not that Nemesis Games needs any extra effort to stand out. I can honestly say that this is, while not necessarily my favorite Expanse novel, undoubtedly the most well-written of the five books released so far.And I don\u2019t say that lightly. Each of the four previous novels are truly epic stories, with great ideas and conflicts interspersed with honest introspection and quiet human moments. It must be said, however, that Ty Franck and Daniel Abraham are in full control of their craft here, as this is a story that is both immensely grand in scope and delivery, while also examining human emotion and relationships in very intimate and honest ways. I don\u2019t know that I\u2019ve read another science fiction book that so deftly balances the macro and the micro levels.Unlike previous books in the series, where the crew of the Rocinante (Jim Holden being the notable exception) have been support characters, in Nemesis Games they all get their own story arcs to follow. This allows us to get up close and personal with this colorful cast of characters that we have followed over the years, but never truly known. Through their named chapters, we get to learn about their pasts, and the events that shaped them and led them to the Canterbury, and from there to the Rocinante. The coolest thing about truly getting to know these characters is that they are all completely different. They read different, their motivations are different, and they react completely differently because of it. Unsurprisingly, Alex Kamal\u2019s portions of the story get eclipsed by both Naomi\u2019s and Amos\u2019 chapters, as their tales are more involved and nuanced, and in the case of Amos, just far more entertaining. It\u2019s like reading the books from A Song of Ice and Fire; you just know that Tyrion\u2019s chapters will be more fun than the rest, even if he isn\u2019t necessarily doing anything interesting. Speaking of Amos Burton\u2026he has some surprising depth and pathos considering he\u2019s essentially a violent sociopath whose anger is only tempered by some great trade skills and the (imperfect) wisdom of age. Even though Naomi\u2019s story is the most \u201ccomplete\u201d, including a detailed backstory which is essential to the current narrative, Amos\u2019 chapters were easily my favorite, and I\u2019m certain I won\u2019t be the only one who feels that way.As for the story itself, it\u2019s a doozy, reminiscent of David Weber\u2019s detailed battles and schemes, without all the \u201cwe are the most honorable and witty people you\u2019ll EVER meet\u201d character beats and the \"seven sentences to describe an air duct\" filler. Keep in mind that I love Weber\u2019s books, but he does tend to prattle on and on\u2026and on\u2026and on\u2026 Anyways, where was I? Oh yes, the story! Without going too much into spoiler territory, the crew find themselves dockside while the Rocinante undergoes some much needed repairs following the events of Cibola Burn. For various reasons, each of the crew (sans Holden) has to depart to deal with something from their past. Through various means and methods, they all get involved in separate events that tie into the narrative as a whole, and then must find a way to reconnect through the drama and conspiracy that threatens them all. That\u2019s probably the simplest way I can describe the plot, and I am loathe to go into any further detail. Some VERY big things happen in this book, things that fundamentally alter the universe going forward, and to spoil any of it would be a huge disservice to the authors. Ironically enough, the protomolecule (the instigator of nearly every bad thing in the first four books) barely makes an appearance here, and that\u2019s totally ok. There\u2019s enough human made drama to fill twice the pages we are given, so we don\u2019t even notice the molecule\u2019s absence.I will admit to being a bit apprehensive when I first started Nemesis Games. The splitting of the crew seemed to set the stage for a somewhat underwhelming adventure. The initial few chapters were slow, and almost rote in how they unfolded. Everyone just sort of drifts away, with little input as to why, and I started to wonder if being five books into an ongoing series was taking its toll on the authors. I was truly afraid that this would be the first Expanse book that didn\u2019t really light my fire. But then\u2026BAM!...we\u2019re off to the races, and we never really look back. So shame on me for doubting! Honestly, the slow first few chapters were my only complaint. And in retrospect, I can see why they were written that way. When the big drama happens, and it happens pretty soon into the story, those quiet early moments helped to make the impact that much more visceral. And though this feels almost like a transitional book (the established Expanse universe giving way to this new, uncharted future), there\u2019s enough action and interplay that it doesn\u2019t underwhelm.So yeah, kudos again to Ty Franck and Daniel Abraham. Through five novels they have managed to keep everything fresh and exciting. No two books read exactly the same or have the same plot beats. By giving us time in each of the crew member\u2019s heads, we are that much more invested in the characters and the story. I am eagerly awaiting book six!"}, {"userName": "Kevin Kelsey", "userReviewDate": "Feb 17, 2015", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/10445368-kevin-kelsey", "userReview": "Easily the best in the series so far. No question about that. Instead of introducing several new characters and slowly weaving them into the plot along with the Rocinante crew, this one buckles down on the core characters and delivers in strides. A lot happens, considering that no time had to be spent giving us info on all new people, the bulk of the book fully develops backstories and gives us the goods on the main characters. Naomi brings it all home in this one, and it's amazing to finally see her in action. She was always a little in the background in the previous books, but not here. The Amos chapters are pure fun, and his backstory first established in The Churn is continued to a great conclusion. Bobbie is back, paired with Alex for most of the story, and Avasarala is as vulgar and pissed as ever. Her interactions with Amos were my favorite thing about this one.The story itself is a massive shakeup to this universe, and will have long lasting reverberations for the books to follow. Characters are changed, permanently. Big things happen. Stuff goes down. There was also some great setup for what's to follow. This book was complete in and of itself, but in a way it felt like the first half of an absolute epic. Book 6 is too far away right now, and I honestly feel like it's going to blow this whole series wide open for the remaining 3 books after.I am excited."}, {"userName": "Robyn", "userReviewDate": "May 29, 2016", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/25037254-robyn", "userReview": "I really liked getting into the heads of the entire crew of the Rocinante. It was a good way to get around the fact that they were separated through most of the book and still retain the feel of the closeness of the crew in the previous books.

Can\u2019t expect everyone to be on the same page. We\u2019re still humans after all. Some percentage of us are always going to be assholes.\"Although it took me a while to get into this book (my fault, not the novel), Nemesis Games turned into one of my favourite from this series. For a while now, I had wanted to get more about the crew of the Rocinante and this instalment finally delivered! Not only do we get their back stories and how their past affects them, we also see them in perfect focus. At first, I worried having the team 'dismembered' like this, but soon I realised this was the only way to let them shine and develop. I particularly loved how being far from each other physically made them actually realise that they are a family. The authors didn't stop there and brought back a few favourite past characters too - Bobbi and Aravasala - as well as less beloved ones. And what about the plot? It reminded me a little of the very first book with the big dichotomy, not just of planets and Belters, but people with opposite outlooks.\"There are two sides in this, but they aren\u2019t inner planets and outer ones. Belters and everyone else. It\u2019s not like that. It\u2019s the people who want more violence and the ones who want less. And no matter what other variable you sample out of, you\u2019ll find some of both.\"Ultimately, this is a fight for survival taken to extremes, as it often happens, humans being their own worst enemies.
