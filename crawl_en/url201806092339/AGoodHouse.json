It's not a very long book but I had a sinking feeling on page 1 as the little stream burbled out of a cleft in the hills, made its way through the town whose name I forget, performed a right turn at the backs of some houses with a story to tell and proceeded in a north-westerly direction past the parade ground where ... I'm making the details up, but this was the tone. Way too much whimsy and inconsequential detail. It's the story of an extended family in a small Canadian town from the post-war years to round about now. It could have been interesting, but as the host of characters who might or might not have had some bearing on later developments grew, I felt more and more detached.It was like listening to the relative with verbal diarrhoea who has an great piece of history to tell but fancies themselves as a raconteur - can't help filling in every detail and following every thread so you have tuned out long before the end. For me that was chapter 1, somewhere in the '50s.

It's the story of a family over 50 years, which seems kind of ho-hum, been-there-read-that, right?Burnard makes it into something more. She makes daily life and the big events (illness, early death, loss of love) equally riveting. I slowed down as I came to the last few chapters of this novel, not wanting to hurry it.There's nothing epic in this family's story, but Burnard makes their time on earth seem both hard to bear and worth it.Why not a 5-star? I'm measuring it against other books it, for some reason, reminds me of, for example, Stone Diaries by Carol Shields and Housekeeping by Marilynne Robinson, which are 5s. This?

I was rather partial to the story gaps, where chapters would start 2-9 years later and you are left to catch up on what had happened and what was happening. I found it an enticing way to read a story.The almost never judgmental love that is portrayed in the story is a nice change from the often dysfunctional families in so many books.I also like how, for the most part, the entire story focuses on the people in the family. Not on the changing world around them or even how those changes are effecting them. It's just about family dynamics through 50 years of love, tragedy, marriage, divorce, death and children."}, {"userName": "Candice", "userReviewDate": "Sep 12, 2011", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/189647-candice", "userReview": "I almost gave up on this a couple of times. It is a family story told over a period of 50 years, but the author goes into way too much detail. It begins in 1949, then jumps to 1953, then 1955 and on up to 1997. Sometimes these gaps make the story a bit difficult to follow. A child is born in 1963, and is mentioned in 1970, but you don't really know much about her until she is an adult in 1986. With the birth of children and grandchildren, there were so many characters I had trouble keeping track of all of them and the various spouses.

This book is about a family, so you would expect some sort of emotion, some human aspect. Instead it felt like a laundry list of the family events accompanied by excessive detail about their surroundings. A moment would peak and the author simply wrote \"then they understood why she was crying\", except she never tells us, and there wasn't enough character development for the reader to figure it out! Of course, we knew exactly what they were eating and where they were sitting when it happened...The fact that I put this book down in the middle of a dramatic thunderstorm and a moment of illicit relations between two characters should illustrate how unmoved I was by this book.--Geez...I guess it really annoyed me!

The postwar boom and hope for the future color every facet of life: the possibilities seem limitless for Bill, his wife Sylvia, and their three children.In the fifty years that follow, the possibilities narrow. Sylvia's untimely death marks her family indelibly but in ways only time will reveal. Paul's perfect marriage yields an imperfect child. Daphne unabashedly follows an unconventional path, while Patrick discovers that his happiness requires a series of compromises. Bill confronts the onset of old age less gracefully than anticipated, and throughout, his second wife, Margaret, remains, surprisingly, the family anchor.\"(From Amazon) I had no expectations of this novel but WOW what a great read...and it's Canadian. A look at a family in the post-WWII. A Canadian Jennifer Haigh in my opinion.

As close to perfect as any I\u2019ve read. A 1999 Giller Prize winner who\u2019s author sadly passed away earlier this year. This is a sweeping epic of a story spanning multiple years: 1949-1997. Telling the story of the Chambers family, a mostly typical Canadian family from small town Ontario. A family that suffered its share of tragedies starting with daughter Daphne\u2019s horrific fall from a makeshift trapeze at age 12. What makes this book brilliant is the style employed by Ms. Burnard: distant third person, jumping between multiple Points of Views and multiple years (5-7) where much of what happened in between is slowly revealed through whichever character\u2019s point of view it is. A delicate unveiling of all that is wonderful and terrible in the lives of these people. How the author manages to build such a strong attachment and familiarity with all these characters despite the number of them and the removed narration is sheer genius. These characters are real and fallible and, by the end of the book, as eerily familiar to you as if they were your own family. They stick with you long after the close of the book as does the absolutely perfect ending: a close with Margaret examining a family picture on the steps of the town hall. 37 of them squished in the limited space. All because Bill, the family patriarch insisted this picture be taken before the hall is torn down. Margaret reflects that someone should write the names of who\u2019s who in the picture before they\u2019re forgotten, a \u201clegend\u201d she calls it to mark that moment, this family; all their heartaches and joys. Brilliant to the very last word.

They are ordinary people and at first I felt that the writer was keeping the characters at a distance, but by the time they lived their lives over 50 years the portrait felt intimate.Death, friendship, love, childhood, parenthood, aging and ambition are among the themes explored as one would expect from this type of tale.The era is depicted well, the 50s that seem so innocent to us now and beyond.Well worth reading."}, {"userName": "Tracey", "userReviewDate": "Aug 12, 2017", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/62701774-tracey", "userReview": "I have to admit that I did not really enjoy this book. It reads as if it is someones musings about a family they once knew. It is full of long, rambling and poetic sentences but nothing really happens.

It was an old fashioned, generational family saga, with the writing so beautiful that you were unaware somehow. The tale meandered, much as life does, with evolving relationships and emerging tolerances. There were brief hints of the typical Canadian arrogance towards Americans, but I can forgive her that.

That is the opening sentence of Bonnie Burnard's \"A Good House.\" People laugh whenever I describe a book as having simply-too-many-words but I will forever be able to present this book as the ideal example. Burnard writes in two extremes: painfully describing every minute detail of the setting while managing to withhold more than the starkest insight into any of the character's thoughts and motivations- a rather impressive feat for a book written in the third person omniscient and filled with so many other banal descriptions of place. There is a great story to be found amidst all the clutter. Sadly, one has to sift through so much chaff to get to the wheat that the pleasure of reading is quickly turned into work of the hard-labour sort. The character of Margaret is the one thing that kept me even remotely interested in reading the story; she quickly became my favourite female character of all the books I've read this year. She is an everywoman with whom I easily identified. Margaret is the reason this book gets two stars instead of the one star that I am so tempted to impart on this bit of prolix prose."}, {"userName": "Jordan", "userReviewDate": "May 14, 2017", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/12942424-jordan", "userReview": "Giller Prize winner of 1999, the end of the century!

Some of the children choose a traditional route, marrying and having children of their own. One forges her own very new path. The clan expands and changes; marriages fail and careers bloom.
