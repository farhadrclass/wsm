There are three main viewpoints: Jennie, Hugh, and Brad. I liked how the author subtly connected the viewpoints when she first introduced them to us. Hugh was a teacher Jennie knew; Hugh lost his girlfriend to Brad, his brother. Although, I wonder what purpose Brad will serve later on in the story as he seems to just be there to add conflict and contrast with his brother, so you know he's going to have to come up again. The characters felt real with their own unique quirks, thoughts, and personalities. And when Jennie's dad handed her the hammer, I lost it. The story. It was well-written and flowed well. The tension just kept building and building until you wonder when it was going to pop. Everything came to life. The setting, the characters, their problems, the presence of the aliens. I could just taste the tears, feel the fear, the pain, the loss, and the vibrations. A few times I felt something was too easy. Just handed to me, telling me something, rather than letting me figuring it out for myself. Like when Jennie determines why she couldn't take anything from anyone. It was there in her character and actions, so I didn't think I needed to be told this directly. But then, I could relate to her need for wanting to help, to do something, and not just sit there. The concept. I loved it. What if? What if the demons of Revelation were aliens? And they had blighted the water supply, diminished the sun, and killed 1/3 of the Earth's population. And what about Revelation 9:6, people wanting to die, but not being able to? Zombies??? The faith aspect breathes organically through the characters, and it does not try to preach or convert anyone, but to wonder, what if? Yes, zombies, aliens, and the Apocalypse.And the ending! It was so good, making me wish the sequel was already out. Although, I haven't been told there was sequel, but the way it ended, there better be. Ha!Very clean read, if you don't mind a little gore. We are dealing with zombies here, but it wasn't over done either. If you love the end-of-the-world type of a story, a bit of horror, thriller, and a touch of romance, check it out! *I was given an advanced reader copy in exchange for an honest review."}, {"userName": "\u2665\u2661\u00a2\u03c3\u03c3\u043a\u03b9\u0454\u2665\u2661 (Krystle) ", "userReviewDate": "Feb 18, 2014", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/5076023-krystle", "userReview": "You can read this review and more on my blog:\n\n\n\nI received a free copy for this book from the author\u00a0via YA Bound Book Tours in exchange for an honest review.This book was a mixture of quite a few genres. There was a Science Fiction, Horror, and a hint if inspirational/Christian Fiction. I never would have thought that these things would blend well together, but somehow, they did.The story is told from the point of views of three different characters. Jennie is a 19-year old college sophomore, Hugh is a 27-year old\u00a0high school teacher, and Brad is a 23-year old mechanic.\u00a0Jennie was obviously the main character of the novel, and when the story began she was dealing with the awkwardness that comes with being 19. There were times when she wanted to assert her independence, and fought her parents efforts to guide and protect her, but on another level, she wanted them to be there for her. I think we have all gone through this process. You want to be an adult when it comes to how late you get to stay out, but as soon as it's time to pay the bills, you want your parents to see you as a kid again and take care of it. That is pretty much where she was in her life, but everything was magnified by the fact that the world was ending.\u00a0Aliens descended\u00a0upon the earth a year prior to when this story began. The first thing they did was attack the sun and cause the world to be cast in a perpetual late evening sort of haze. Next they poisoned\u00a0the water supply, making it un-drinkable, and lastly they released a horde\u00a0of ravenous\u00a0lion-like\u00a0creatures whose bites infect humans with a virus that turns them into zombies. Jennie finds herself having\u00a0to care for he five-year\u00a0old brother all by herself, and trying to do everything that she can to keep them alive. Along the way she meets up with brothers, Hugh and Brad, and a few other survivors, and they all attempt to make it to a military base so they can be relatively safe from the latest plague.\u00a0Brad was a very strange character. I knew that he was a jerk the first time I got to see things from his perspective. He has a hatred for his older brother, Hugh, that made absolutely no sense to me. Other than wanting to be taken care of financially and\u00a0 use women, his strongest desire is to hurt his brother whenever and however he can. However, this was not a quintessentially\u00a0evil character. One of his first actions in this book is to risk his life in order to save a stranger, and there are moments when I am sure that he had sincere\u00a0feelings of respect and admiration\u00a0for Jennie. There were times when he was a complete coward, but there\u00a0were other times when he was almost reckless in how much he did not fear the situations that he was in, and still other times when his actions were more than decent. I like the fact that the author\u00a0didn't fall back on writing a character who was easy to hate. I don't like most of the decisions that he made, and I know I shouldn't like him, but I do. There is plenty of room for him to grow and become a better man in future books, but right now, his selfishness and hatred is preventing him from being the man who\u00a0I caught a few glimpses of in this book.\u00a0Hugh was not as well-developed\u00a0as the other characters. He is a scientist and thinks like\u00a0a scientist so he lacked the passion that the other two\u00a0characters exhibited. He was very brave, intelligent, and kind, and I couldn't help but like him though. Every now and then, he would have moments of awkwardness (usually brought on by an interaction with Jennie), and I grew to like him more and more when those moments happened. I like my heroes to have a few chinks in their armor, but most of the time those imperfections come in the form of the dark and brooding leading man. Hugh is the exact opposite of that character. He has a sort of calm maturity that mixes well with a very pure and innocent spirit, and that leads people to\u00a0misunderstand his intentions. It is hard to believe that someone could really be motivated by goodness the way that he is, but he is, and I like it. He will make a great leader in the not too distant future.\u00a0There is a hint of romance\u00a0in this book, and although a love triangle could develop\u00a0later, it is unlikely. Even if Brad grows up and becomes\u00a0a good man, he will always only be half\u00a0the man his brother is in Jennie's eyes. The age difference between Hugh and Jennie is mentioned a few times, and the two of them see this as an obstacle\u00a0that should keep them apart, but I disagree. Because she is 19 and he is 27, the eight year age difference is a lot, but when you factor in all that Jennie has seen and the fact that she is basically raising a five-year\u00a0old alone, it is not hard to believe that she is emotionally\u00a0mature enough to handle a relationship with an older man. They provide each other with something that they both need, and I hope that their relationship continues to develop and strengthen.\u00a0The\u00a0cliffhanger at the end let me know that all of the characters\u00a0are temporarily in a safe place, but their journey is not complete so I very much want to read what happens next. This was a fresh take on the zombie, alien, and dystopian genres, and I enjoyed it very much.Because of violence, I would recommend this book for ages 13 and up."}, {"userName": "\u273fkawehi.reviews", "userReviewDate": "Sep 14, 2014", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/12789361-kawehi-reviews", "userReview": "\u2606 I received an GCRBook Tours from the author in exchange for an honest review.

A third of the waters turned bitter, and many people died from the waters that had become bitter.The fourth angel sounded his trumpet, and a third of the sun was struck, a third of the moon, and a third of the stars, so that a third of them turned dark. A third of the day was without light, and also a third of the night.As I watched, I heard an eagle that was flying in midair call out in a loud voice: \u201cWoe! Woe! Woe to the inhabitants of the earth, because of the trumpet blasts about to be sounded by the other three angels!\u201d\nRevelation 8:11-13\n\nSalvation\n follows the aftermath of three different individuals after the Earth is attacked by the Shisa (aliens).Jennie: our lead protagonist and main character of this story-is a 19 year old girl, who throughout this bleak ordeal, still believes that there is still hope at the end of the tunnel even if all may look to be lost. She loses both of her parents during the epidemic and becomes the sole guardian and care taker of her little brother, Mickey. Hugh: is the former \u2018hot biology teacher\u2019- turned lead researcher in charge of decoding the nature of the alien virus and investigating whether its effects (on humans) can be reversed. He is Jennie\u2019s love interest and is a very smart, curious, and compassionate individual that will put his life on the line to save those he cares for. Hugh is well liked among all of the characters but ironically shares a strained relationship with brother, Brad--who lies and tries to sabotage Jennie's impression of Hugh.Brad:is your typical younger bratty brother stuck in the shadow of Hugh-- his older, studious and perfect mold of a brother. Brad is a ladies\u2019 man, a social climber, user, and gold digger and has taken an interest in Jennie solely due to Hugh\u2019s fascination with her. He has no sense of loyalty to anyone other than to himself.\nThe story in detail:\nEarth is under siege. Our sun has been attacked, our water supply is now rendered undrinkable, and now dog-lion like creatures are roaming our streets infecting our people with a toxin that turns people into zombies and causes them to bite and spread the virus and thus annihilate the human race.Now with the Earth in shatters and its inhabitants dying, Jennie and a few survivors must gather their inner strength in this race against time to find a cure for the infected and a weakness for the Shisa while trying to stay alive and save their world from invasion. Who will live? Who will die? Is it really the world apocalypse? And is there any way in stopping it?Read and you will find out!\nMy thoughts:\n #Who knew that having faith could be the true key to salvation, and in this particular case, survival? Hah, makes me want to pick up a Bible and go to church! lol.I ABSOLUTELY LOVED, LOVED, LOVED this story as it was mind gripping, intriguing and yet disturbing, and totally engrossed me into the plot line and all of the character mind frames and plights!! I already can\u2019t wait for bk2! I hope there will be an actual romance for Hugh and Jennie and that Brad will FINALLY get a clue!! NO ONE LIKES HIM!!

The aliens inside haven\u2019t done anything in the six weeks since their arrival other than hover in their crafts and contaminate the water supply, but everyone is terrified and waiting for the other shoe to drop. Wow, does it ever drop hard! Jennie\u2019s mom is the first in her family to be injured by one of the creatures that escaped from the space crafts. Her dad rushes her to the hospital and Jennie is left behind to get her little brother ready and off to the hospital to meet them. On the way to the hospital Jennie sees all the chaos that has ensued since the creatures took over their town. The roads are full of bodies and abandoned vehicles, and the hospital parking lot is an even worse sight. Once inside all hell breaks loose. Nothing is ever going to be the same again.Just to make sure we\u2019re clear\u2026 you all know that a hospital is the last place you want to be when the undead begin to rise, right? Do NOT go to any hospital no matter who has been taken there! Whoever they were, they now want to eat your face off. If you\u2019re already at a hospital when shit hits the fan, get the hell out and run or drive as far away as you can. You have been warned.Jennie is our main character for the most part, but the story is told from several different POVs. I love stories that come at you from different angles because it gives such depth to the characters and richness to the plot. Hugh and Brad are brothers and we get to see this gruesome hell on earth through their eyes as well. They are complete opposites. Hugh is a super awesome guy that anyone would want at their side during an alien invasion/zombie apocalypse. Brad is a gold digging whore of a man that is so self-involved he makes you want to throw him straight into the mouths of the infected. I rooted for him to die \u2014 twisted, but true. We also get to know Jennie\u2019s local pastor and his wife, awesome characters that provide light and hope for Jennie and her brother, Mickey, in these dark times. Trust me, they really need it.This book starts off with a bang and made my heart start racing almost immediately. This is not your typical zombie novel. I love all things zombie related, as you must realize by now, but this story is especially unique due to the different elements that I never expected to find in zombie fiction. Sanctuary is a blend of science fiction, thriller, post-apocalyptic horror, zombies and even a bit of Christian fiction. This is a book unlike anything I\u2019ve read before and I\u2019m super happy that I was given the opportunity to read it for zOctober. All fans of horror, zombies and science fiction will want to get their hands on this as soon as possible!"}, {"userName": "Adam Collings", "userReviewDate": "Sep 18, 2013", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/5752180-adam-collings", "userReview": "An alien invasion which brings about a zombie-like plague, all set against the biblical end-times prophecies in the book of Revelation. This is a fantastic premise with which to begin a novel. I enjoyed the combined sense of looming dread and awe that opens the book. Aliens have landed. They've done something to the sun and they've poisoned our water, but beyond that nothing. They just sit in their ships day in day out. Will they ever come out and make contact? Will they try to exterminate us? The characters just don't know.I liked how the protagonist Jennie is suddenly thrust into a position of responsibility, having to be the parent figure for her little brother when things get desperate.I wouldn't really call this an end-times novel in the traditional sense. Biblical prophecy is barely mentioned in the book. The links mostly come from the occasional quote from Revelation in the section breaks. The way the author has interpreted these quotes in a sci-fi context is very clever. You probably wouldn't want to base your end-times theology off the novel, but it's sure is a heck of a lot of fun. This is one of the things that make Christian speculative fiction interesting - the unique what-if questions that can arise.I felt that there were some structural weaknesses in this book - in terms of plot and character. There were three point-of-view characters - Jennie, Hugh and Brad. A lot of the early Hugh and Brad scenes could probably have been cut, and their backstory woven in as reveals after they meet up with Jennie. Brad felt a little under-utilised like a dangling thread that didn't really go anywhere. Hugh's arc was very sudden - with him undergoing a change right at the end that left me feeling a little confused.I hope the author writes a sequel because I feel there is a lot of unmet potential. In some ways this book feels like the first act of a larger story. If this book becomes a series I would read more as I enjoyed spending time in this world and happily continue.I received a free copy of this book in exchange for an honest review."}, {"userName": "Everything Marie", "userReviewDate": "Sep 29, 2013", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/10965853-everything-marie", "userReview": "\u200bWow, this book was surprisingly pretty good. I really enjoyed it. And on top of all that, the story was based in my hometown in Virginia! Who knew right??!! Okay, so right off the bat, the story starts off with Jennie, a college student experiencing the worst of all things. Within the first chapter, Earth has been invaded by aliens, well more precisely UFO's, (the silver saucers) and they have all settled above major cities all around the world. Jennie, along with her mother, father, and 5-year old brother, are trying to cope with Earth's new visitors. First, the aliens attack the sun, making it more dimmer. The summers are colder, the winters are longer, and the plant-life is no more. Then, the aliens poison the water supply. The contamination wipes out one-third of Earth's population, killing humans and marine life as well. Then, out off nowhere, the UFO's open and unleash creatures, who look like oversized dogs but move like lions, into the cities. The creatures attack the humans, of all ages, biting them profusely and causing some major bleeding. Unfortunately, Jennie's mother is a victim of the attack. Jennie's father rushes her mother to the hospital, so Jennie decides to drive separately with her brother, Mickey. Once they arrive, the hospital's emergency room is flooded with victims of the attack. People are crying, bleeding, and yelling in pain. The chaotic surroundings prevent Jennie from finding her folks right away and she is left caring for her brother. But something happens to the victims. They become violent and sluggish. They start wailing so loudly, it becomes deafening. Then, the victims start to attack doctors and nurses by biting them. Everyone is screaming! Blood is everywhere! Somehow, the alien attacks have altered the humans and they have become zombies! Whoa!! I really liked this story. It shows the power that one girl can have, with the help of faith and hope. Jennie must overcome her fear of the unknown and take care of her brother. She is brave, nurturing, strong, and by far, kick-ass!! I loved her in this book. The story also portrays the life of Hugh, a biology teacher from Jennie's old high school. I loved, loved, loved Hugh! I really enjoyed reading his POV. He is smart, funny, brave, and so damn sexy, in a geeky kind of way! LOL I still have a lot of questions that need answers as I felt there was a little cliffhanger at the end. So, I'm desperately hoping there is a sequel. All in all, this was an interesting read and I recommend it to anyone who enjoys a good zombie book, with a little romance."}, {"userName": "Kimber Wheaton", "userReviewDate": "Oct 16, 2013", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/16667146-kimber-wheaton", "userReview": "*I received this book from the author in exchange for an honest review*Sanctuary is a fast-paced urban sci-fi suspense. While the protagonist's age it somewhere between YA and New Adult, I also feel it's suitable for middle school as well. In fact, I think the Middle Grade audience will really appreciate the non-stop action. Sanctuary is a clean read; I can't recall any use of offensive language, and the attacks, though bloodthirsty, are almost more interesting than violent.Jennie is about to enter her sophomore year of college. It's been a year since the aliens first appeared, attacking the sun and poisoning the water supply. When the new attacks surface, Jennie is separated from her parents, leaving her to care for her five year old brother, Mickey. Jennie is a wonderful girl. She's sweet and loyal; her patience is never-ending. Not only that, but she's strong, in body, spirit, and mind. She's a great role model for anyone.Hugh Harris is a high school biology teacher that hides in his apartment after the attacks, watching everything play out on TV. He begins to develop his own theories about the alien attacks. When he decides he can't sit around doing nothing anymore, he runs into Jennie and her brother fleeing from the monsters. Hugh may be the only person who comprehends just what is happening from a biological standpoint. I really liked Hugh. Unlike his cad brother, Brad, Hugh is a gentleman and a scholar.This story is told from multiple perspectives. At times I think it switches around a bit too much. It becomes rather distracting after a while. I don't think we needed Brad's perspective at all. He didn't bring much but a bad attitude to the party. This story is more about the people involved and less about the actual events. While I like reading about the characters, I wanted to know more about the aliens and the science behind the attacks. It's all hinted at but never delved into. I did enjoy how quickly things move forward; there was never a dull moment. The ending is not so much an ending as a potential new beginning, so I'm assuming there may be another book in the works. Faith plays a large role in the overall plot, so if that's not your thing, you may be disappointed.Sanctuary is a good choice for everyone middle school and up that enjoys a fast paced adventure. Please keep in mind, the story contains monster attacks, blood/gore, and mass death. Some younger readers might find this book too scary. I plan to pass this recommendation on to my middle school-age son and his friends...they're all addicted to anything zombie right now :)"}, {"userName": "Amber", "userReviewDate": "Jul 23, 2013", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/7698480-amber", "userReview": "Sanctuary by Pauline Creeden is an immensely introspective and fiercely volatile vision of the human heart and soul. The level of emotion and the depth of feeling that runs through the pages of this book will tear at your heart until only truth remains. This is one story that packs a huge punch in such a small package! You never know what is coming next, and that will have you biting your nails in both terrifying fear and eager anticipation. You will be at odds with yourself the entire time, but you will not want to stop reading.This is definitely one story that I never could even begin to anticipate what would happen next. I can\u2019t tell you how much I enjoyed that! To say that I enjoyed this story would be grossly understating my feelings toward this beautiful masterpiece. Sanctuary pushed my comfort zone on so many different levels that I couldn\u2019t possibly take them all in at once. My senses were on high alert the entire time, and I was awe of the heart and soul that permeated every word along the way. There were no idle or useless words written or spoken throughout; they were all immensely impactful and unreservedly invaluable.The mix of genres in this story is truly shocking and utterly astonishing. The way that they are all effortlessly interwoven like they were always meant to be together is absolutely priceless and beyond words. Creeden is definitely an author that is not afraid to take changes and boldly pushes the literary envelope. My heart tells me that she has so much more to offer, and I for one can\u2019t wait to see what comes next!If you enjoy books that challenge you and force you to reevaluate everything you hold dear, then Sanctuary is a book that you have to read. It will make you think, force you to feel, and turn your world upside down and yet you will find yourself eagerly welcoming this whirlwind of change into your heart. You will beg for it not to stop until you have seen it through to the end because you just have to know what it is all about and what it means to you."}, {"userName": "Alexia Purdy", "userReviewDate": "Aug 08, 2013", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/5898148-alexia-purdy", "userReview": "This review first posted to my blog: http://alexiaepurdy.blogspot.com/2013...If you love apocalyptic stories, this one would fit the bill. I was fortunate to get to read a beta edition of this book. Elements of the story could change prior to publication fyi.Jennie Ransom finds herself in the middle of the apocalypse when UFO spaceships appear over cities on earth. Weeks later, everyone is trying to live a normal life but it all goes down the drain on one terrifying day.What the heck happened? I loved this story, it was scary, creepy, and suspenseful. Absolutely the kind of zombie story that holds more realistic than some others do. It holds nothing back. There were creatures who scared the crap out of me, zombies which were true to real zombie lore and I hope I never come across either one of them.Jennie finds herself holed up in her house with her brother Mickey and her parents when the stagnant UFO\u2019s decide to release something new on earth: huge dog-like creatures. When her mother gets bit by one of them, her father takes her to the hospital to save her life. Trying to join her parents in the hospital, Jennie discovers that people are transforming into mindless flesh eating zombies from these bites and must escape from there to find a safe place. On the run with her brother, she meets sweet pastor named Billy Crawford who, with his wife, run a church sanctuary to help others during this time of starvation and danger. She also runs into a former teacher Hugh, who sees something in Jennie that sparks something more, and his devious brother is also in tow, a womanizing prick named Brad. When their attempt to find a better place to stay alive leads them all to a military base at Fort Monroe, where they should be safe, nothing is far from the truth as the aliens continue to appear.I can\u2019t wait for this book to release.

Needless to say, I was severely disappointed with this novel.The description promised some great action with intriguing plot. Instead I suffered through a terrible main character, lots of badly developed side characters, and the main plot being absolutely awful. I do mean horrendous. It's World War Z combined with Signs with a good dose of religion. Unlike World War Z (awful movie!) where the zombies aren't interested in sick people, in this book the aliens who make zombies move right past people with a solid testimony in God & Jesus! Yup! And it has to be a real testimony so to prove this the author makes the Pastor die. Gee, who saw that coming? But don't worry, our main character Jennie magically turns from a horribly selfish person to Mother Mary and is the key to everyone figuring out how to not get bitten! And as in Signs the aliens don't like water. In this book they have poisoned it by adding something that makes it more tolerable to them. I'm not even going to touch the scenery and world the author made. Alien ships have been hovering over the world and yet Starbucks is open, everyone drives around like normal, television is still on, and there doesn't seem to be much of an issue with food supply till after the aliens start biting people. Apparently having the Sun dimmed more than halfway has zero impact on the food supply. Yup, despite 1/3 of the world's population being gone it's business as usual! The only character that made this book slightly decent was Hugh. Well, Hugh right up until the author had him hook up with our unrealistic main character. At that point I was just glad the book was about over. The formatting of the story also left much to be desired."}, {"userName": "Y.I.

It kept me up most nights way passed my bedtime. I got so involved with the characters I couldn't stop reading. The story is a great mix of horror, suspense, faith and a touch of romance. In parts it was so frightening; I found myself fearfully clutching my kindle, and wondering; what's going to happen next. I like the way the author Pauline Creeden structured the book, giving each character, Jennie, Hugh and Brad their own chapters, and then bringing it all together at the end. It worked really well. I loved Jennie, she is strong, but normal...not some over the top unrealistic female heroin. I really related to her. I could feel her fear, distress and vulnerability. The book is so well written; I cared for every character, which added to my stress levels when something bad happened to them. I'm not sure I would have been as brave as Jennie under such circumstances. As a Christian, I found this book challenging on many levels. How unselfish and compassionate would I be in the same situation? How would I honestly respond if someone I cared about was in such terrible danger? While reading it, and even now, I find myself wondering where I would hide if such a scenario should happen here and now. Talk about a roller coaster ride of high adrenalin and abject fear!I'm not generally a fan of zombie stories, but this really grabbed me, and to say I was fed up when I finished it is an understatement! I really, really hope there is a sequel.Sanctuary is so good I would have given it ten stars if it were possible. Do I recommend it? You bet!"}, {"userName": "K.M.

My favourite genres are dystopian & post apocalyptic. From the blurb I'd guess this book is post apocalyptic. The title of the book is \"sanctuary\" I presume the characters within the book find or create some sort of, 'safe haven' from whatever type of apocalypse has struck the world. Then upon reading the blurb, I saw that it wasn't my the usual type of global disaster apocalypse. In this book the apocalypse is because Aliens have landed on earth. I don't normally enjoy \"alien type stories\" but am keeping an open mind as I approach reading this one.MY REVIEWI downloaded an ecopy of this book from Amazon UK when it was price promoted. I have promoted this author and her books on my blog in the past. I also read an excerpt from Survivor (the novella that is Book 2 in the Sanctuary End Times Series), and it made me want to read the series.The cover of this book a crow sat on an outcropping of rocks looking into the sea for fish to eat. The background of the cover shows the skyline set against a damaged dimmer sun and dark clouds in the sky which creates atmosphere and adds to the post apocalyptic feel of the cover. So would the cover make me pick this one up from a book store shelf? I think being totally truthful whether I picked this book up or not would depend what was on the shelf around it. Being totally honest the cover alone would not urge me to pick this one up. It was the blurb that pulled my attention and made me ask enough questions to want to read and learn more.Aliens have come to earth, they have attacked the sun causing it to be dimmer and not as strong or warm as it used to be. The aliens have also somehow poisoned the water supply, which has killed the fish, hence the crow on the cover, lonely and looking for food at the waters edge. The people on earth, including the military and government are just trying to stay indoors and are waiting for the aliens next move.When the aliens make their move, no one is expecting it, or organised enough to deal with it. The military eventually prepare strategic military bases to take in survivors and provide a place of relative safety they can live in. This book is told from various characters' points of view, what their life was before the aliens attacked, trapped in their homes watching the TV and listening to the news. The news people speak to various sources and a Dr call's the alien creatures \"Shisa\". The different characters also tell how they survived, the people and things they lost, as well as how they get to a military base. Then there's the question of are the military bases totally safe or will the aliens attack? The Shisa are large dog like creatures that have hair like a lions mane with teeth like sharks! The Shisa have a long cat like tail that has a barb or sting on the end of it. The Shisa seem to attack people on a purely random basis, they then return and attack those same victims again. Could victims survive if they were bitten only once and then isolated and wait for the fever and poison to pass through their systems.The two character's I really liked a lot and was rooting for them to survive throughout the book were Jennie and her little brother Mickey. Jennie has to be brave and grow up really quickly when she is left in charge of her and her younger brother survival in this new warped world. I also enjoyed reading about the too brothers Brad and Hugh. They are brothers but are so different, both feel a chemistry with Jennie when they first meet her. Brad is a womaniser who will spin whatever story and line he needs to, to get him where he wants to be and what he wants. Hugh is a \"hot\" biology teacher who taught at the school that Jennie attending, though he never taught her.There are so many situations and scenarios that the characters have to go through, and deal with. From a parent who has been attacked locking his children away so he cannot hurt them when the \"virus\" gets a hold of him. Then there's a family that return to their home to hideaway and discover that all their food has been taken out of their home. They have been left with nothing. When they go to their once friendly neighbours to ask for shelter they find themselves being callously and rather blatantly ignored.This book is not just about an apocalypse, it is about how people react to a threat they know nothing about.The book does have a religious element to it, initially the Chapters begin with a quote from Revelations. There are also two religious characters in the form of Pastor Billy and his wife Mrs Crawfood. The Pastor and his wife station themselves at the church, as they think is the best place for them to help people. They offer \"sanctuary\" at the church and distribute what supplies of clothes and food they have between those survivors that have made it to the church. Pastor Billy, his wife and fellow survivors all board the church bus and head toward the military base that is taking people in. So did I enjoy the book? Yes, it was a great mash up of Post Apocalyptic & Sci-fi genres. Would I recommend the book? Yes, I think it has a little something for everyone within this book. There's action, drama, mystery with a touch of betrayal, suspense and a hint of romance too. So it should appeal to a wide range of readers.Would I want to read more in this series? Yes please! Although I have read an excerpt from the Survivor novella I would like to read the whole novella, and anything else that is written as part of this series. Would I want to read other titles by this author? Yes I throughly enjoyed the writing, descriptions and action in this book so I'd always check out the blurbs of anything written by this author in the future."}, {"userName": "Kristin (Blood,Sweat and Books)", "userReviewDate": "Nov 12, 2013", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/6974252-kristin-blood-sweat-and-books", "userReview": "Sanctuary begins at the start of an alien apocalypse. The visitors whomever they may be haven't moved in six weeks and while the ships hovering over the Earth are troublesome for 19 year old Jennie life must go on. That is until the ships open and what emerges is neither man, nor friendly. Now in a race for their lives Jennie, her brother Mickey and a small group of survivors try to find sanctuary in what might be the last safe hold in the city.Alien invasions mixed with Zombie-ish creatures is an interesting concept to me as I haven't really seen it done that much before. The \"Aliens\" or Shisa (cross between a lion and a dog, from Japanese mythology) as they would come to be called were as scary as they were unique. I liked that the Author didn't go the route of little green men holding \"We come in Peace.\" signs or something like the Tripods from War of the World. I knew the doors on the ships were bound to open but never expected what appeared so that was a nice surprise.Another thing I liked about the story was it's incredibly fast paced. I read this book in almost an entire sitting and only stopped because I needed to sleep. Of course this also hindered the story in some ways as the characters weren't really fleshed out as much as I'd of liked and also plot points were rushed.Lastly, I liked the character Hugh. He was a man with a plan and was the only one to try and find a cure for the infected. Plus he's super swoon worthy so that certainly helped.Now while I did enjoy Sanctuary I definitely think that the story had room for improvement.One of my biggest gripes with the story were the characters. I just didn't really connect with any of them. In the beginning I liked Jennie she was independent, had a sense of humor and also seemed like a genuinely nice person. However, during the course of the book as the Infected numbers grew she lost that independent streak and instead turned into little miss Sunday School and I didn't really like that. Also she was deeply stupid at times. I get it your little brother is well, little but c'mon man stop babying him and have him help you already. He's going to see the Horror going on eventually so why not get it over and done with. I absolutely cannot stand when people try to baby kids during Apocalyptic situations. Toddlers maybe to an extent but the kid is 5 for Christ sakes. So much bad stuff could be avoided if people and in this case Jennie would just stop trying to shield him from everything and start using him as an asset albeit a tiny one. Oh and don't even get me started on her attitude towards Brad the hot younger brother to Hugh. She obviously missed the memo of Douchebag alert stay away. Speaking of Brad, What was the point of his character exactly? Just to prove not everyone was as good as those in the congregation? Or was it just to give us someone to hate cause if so, then the Author succeeded. Nothing redeemable about that character at all.Another thing I didn't really like about Sanctuary was the way it rushed through certain plot points while dragging out others. We get plenty of back story on Brad, Hugh and the girl Clarrisa but come the big revelation with the character Phillip towards the end and it is glossed over with just a firm handshake and a pat on the back. It was so frustrating. Also I would've liked to know what happened with all the other survivors met along the way and why more hadn't found their way to the base. Surely they'd be sending out convoys to pick people up once the group from the Church mentioned those left behind. Unless of course they were to self absorbed in their own survival and safety to care. Which in all honesty is probably the case.Lastly, I didn't like the ending and it's all brought back to Jennie. She went from being all gung ho about Brad to being completely in lust with Hugh and this is in the span of just days not even weeks. I'm starting to think she has some deep co-dependency issues or something. Also like I mentioned above I wanted to see Phillip more and the Scientists at the base talking excitedly about him pulling through. I mean this is the first real hope they have at helping those infected and it's just glossed over so Jennie can go back to thinking and worrying about Hugh. It was just so irritating even though deep down I did actually want them together.Final ThoughtsSanctuary isn't a perfect book by any means but in the end I did enjoy it and ultimately that is what matters. I know I'll be looking forward to the sequel whenever it releases. If you like shows like Jericho and Survivors or books like Logan Rutherford's The Visitors or Undead by Kirsty McKay than this book is definitely for you. With that being said, I'll be rating Sanctuary by Pauline Creeden \u2605\u2605\u2605. *Copy reviewed provided by Author.

The suspense didn't allow me to rest until I had finished the book a few hours later, with few interruptions, all in one sitting. It was a little difficult for me to discern which genre this story fits most into, categorically. The opening event, an alien invasion, qualifies it as a science fiction tale with apocalyptic overtones when one third of the world's population is destroyed by the poisoned water supply and the darkening of the sun. Since it is fast paced and filled with suspense, I would also call this a thriller or suspense thriller. When vicious lion-like dog creatures are released from the alien ships and began attacking people worldwide, the book ups the ante to the horror genre as these victims were infected with either parasites or a virus that removed their humanity turning them into zombie creatures that wouldn't die. For me, this part of the book was most disturbing with vivid scenes and some gore, since I try to avoid reading anything of this genre. The author's descriptive language is so effective it raised the hairs on my arms and sent a chill down my back while reading about the victims. However, for readers who enjoy the presence of zombies in their books, this could be appealing. The \"wailers\" become a major element of danger that drives the suspenseful action forward since it seems to be their goal to attack the uninfected and spread the disease. One of the main characters central to this story is Jennie Ransom, a college student living at home between semesters. She was just about to return to school when her mother was attacked by the alien creatures, the event that set in motion the heart-pounding events to follow. Arriving at the hospital with her five-year-old brother Mickey in tow, Jennie witnessed horrors as the patients became violent before her eyes. She teamed up with Pastor Billy Crawford at the hospital to search for her parents, but eventually lost them both. She and Mickey found themselves in a struggle to survive. The pastor had already set up his church as a well-provisioned sanctuary for survivors; once she and Mickey arrived, Jennie found time for some soul searching. The young adult genre and spirituality can be added to the mix. Another main character is high school biology teacher Hugh Harris, a scientist working on his PhD in animal behavior and psychology. During the televised coverage of the creature attacks, Hugh made several observations he wanted to share with authorities. When he learned that some military bases were opening to uninfected refugees, he was determined to leave the protection of his locked-down apartment complex to make his way to the nearest base. He encountered Jennie and Mickey on the way to join other survivors at the church sanctuary. In spite of the lack of electric power and fuel, a small group eventually made it to the military base nearby. Even with military protection, the bases were still susceptible to attacks from marauding bands of creatures. At one point, the base where Pastor Crawford's group had found refuge was invaded; Hugh and the pastor were attacked and infected. Hugh survived but Pastor Crawford did not. It was then that Jennie realized she had feelings for Hugh, and likewise Hugh was attracted to the strong person Jennie was becoming in the face of all this tragedy. And what had seemed a completely hopeless situation before the scientist's arrival became hopeful. His observations may help some survive.In spite of crossing a multitude of genre boundaries, including a little light romance, the author somehow makes it all work. There is a blend that makes this an exciting tale for many demographics. Since the story ended without a definite conclusion, I hope there are plans for a part two some time in the near future.

It\u2019s amazing! It\u2019s something else, different \u2013 in a good way, and they writing it\u2019s spectacular. I was gripping my kindle because I was wondering what can happen next. Brilliant, I tell you!Jennie Ransom is a college student who thought she had a normal life, until she was thrown into a life full of aliens. One day, UFO spaceships come crashing down into the cities all around the world. Everybody goes into hiding because they don\u2019t know what to expect. Jennie stays into the house with her brother Mickey and her parents, but nothing feels safe anymore. As if problems weren't enough, the aliens lets loose some kind of big creatures that looks like dogs, and her mother gets bitten by one of them and she leaves for the hospital to try and recover. But, the people doesn't understand the consequences of being bitten by this creatures. Jennie tries to get to her parents at the hospital, but the streets are full of flesh eating zombies and she needs to stay safe in order to survive. If she gets bitten, she will become one of them! And she needs to protect her brother Mickey. Luckily for, on the run, she meets the pastor Billy Crawford who saves her. He and his wife have turned the church into a sanctuary for people to hide and stay safe, at least for a while. But, the aliens keeps appearing and there isn't a safe place anymore, except maybe the military base at Fort Monroe. So...how should I put it...the story was scary as hell, it gave me goose bumps. I felt extremely sorry for Mickey, because he was young and innocent, he didn't deserved what happened to him. For me, the ending of the book had a cliffhanger, so I don\u2019t know if I can expect a second one, but I hope so. I think I've become a little addicted. This book will teach about what courage means and what you can do for you\u2019re love ones with bad things happen.

If one of those monsters doesn't kill me, I'm sure the next alien out of the ship will.\"\u201cIt\u2019s true that some are, but humankind has taken a hard hit even before these Shisa startedattacking people two days ago.\u201d He wiped his brow again and coughed before he continued. \u201cI used to perform two or three funerals a month. But lately, it had been as many as four a week.\u201dJennie shook her head. Her voice quavered. \u201cThey didn't say anything about this on thenews.

The attacks on people made by the Shisa always left the victims injured and seemed to happen at random.2. The time the bitten victims had before they showed symptoms varied but averaged just over an hour. It seemed they were affected by an alien virus of some sort and began attacking bystanders, also leaving them alive.3. No matter the injuries sustained by the victims, they continued to attack. It seemed that bullets to the vital organs made no apparent difference in stopping them.

But only hours after having the conversation the aliens attack, biting Jennie's mother. With her parents rushing ahead to the hospital, Jennie prepares her little brother Mickey to follow. Once there they discover that the attack was far more wide spread than first thought. Meanwhile brothers Brad and Hugh don't see eye to eye, when the attacks break out Hugh is at home watching it all unfold and unable to help, whereas Brad is with Hugh's ex-girlfriend in Starbucks. With everyone wanting to be safe, Jennie and her brother head out towards their local church, and the Crawfords, finding that both Brad and Hugh already there. With the group from the church having made their way to a fortified army base they hope that things will look up, though it seems that it may not be as easy as they thought!I'll start by addressing something that I thought I wouldn't enjoy about this book, and that was the element of Christianity. To put this into context, I don't have anything against Religion, and in fact I am a practicing Protestant as Jennie is, my concern was that I didn't wish to be preached to. However I am very glad to report that at no point did I ever feel that Sanctuary was preaching to me. There were elements of faith in the plot, though the way that they were interwoven were clever and made it clear that it was a part of the story.I must admit that Sanctuary touched me on a much more emotional level than most apocalyptic books, and that is mainly because of Jennie's struggle to keep her little brother safe. At 19, Jennie is just 2 years younger than me, and my own little brother is the same age as hers, 5. And so as you can imagine, the two siblings setting out on their own and trying to keep each other safe really hit a cord with me.I found that this book was rather different in the way that it had three different viewpoints throughout, you had the scientist, the faithful and the womaniser (Hugh, Jennie and Brad respectively) and they each have their own clear agenda. There is also a range of ages in the narrators, giving different perspectives.I really enjoyed Sanctuary, I thought that it was fast paced, emotional and well written."}, {"userName": "Jo Michaels", "userReviewDate": "Mar 06, 2014", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/9153217-jo-michaels", "userReview": "Zombie novel? Love! Christian science fiction with zombies? Um... Wow. I had no idea what I was in for when I started this book. What an awesome twist on the biblical apocalypse. Rather than being some mutated disease causing people to start acting like zombies, what if it's an alien invasion? Well, this is the direction Sanctuary takes you in. Let's get to the good stuff, shall we?From a Reader's Perspective:I loved watching the main character, Jennie, come into her own through the story. When we begin, she's a lot like any tween would be: Self-centered, technology reliant, BFF in place, and has dreams of what she plans to do with herself down the road. As the tale moved on, she becomes a strong, self-reliant young woman. This change was perhaps the most moving one in my eyes. Pacing through the story was great, and I loved the little twists and turns thrown in. Hugh was a great character and I'm eager to see how his relationship with Jennie develops in future books. Oh my goodness what a cliffhanger at the end! If you're not a huge fan of being left with a juicy bone dangling in front of you, the ending will be less than satisfying. But I loved it. I'm now chomping at the bit for the next installment. Aliens were a nice twist to the common zombie novel, but the thing I love most about them was still prevalent: human survival struggles. What would one do in any given situation when they're terrified out of their minds? There's plenty of that going on in Sanctuary. Having said that, let's move on to part two.From an Editor's Perspective:I found a few niggling little errors like: \"...but she knew the door would be locked as the red sign on the door clearly stated they were sorry about.\" and: \"The ideas spun in his Hugh's head like...\" But none of them really took me out of the story, and there were only around fifteen in the whole book.Rating:+1 Star for bringing Jennie into her own via life and death events+1 Star for pacing and plot (both were excellent)+1 Star for the awesome twist on the cause of the zombie virus+1 Star for plenty of human angst during a crisis situation that left me biting my nails+.75 Star for writing and editing-.25 Star for need for a proofreader to eradicate those tiny errorsOverall: 4.75 out of 5 stars!

I love it. The main character/female protagonist, Jennie is portrayed with the backdrop of a Church, the sanctuary for quite a good portion of the book until the characters are forced to move. The Characters:  Jennie: She is a force to be reckoned with. She is brave, becomes a guardian of her younger brother, fights against all odds. Simply an amazing young woman, whose faith never falters, even when the faith of everyone surrounding her pulls them down. She lifts up those around her. She \"walks by faith, not by sight,\" and it is a wonderful thing to behold.  Hugh: A very young, former teacher at Jennie's high school. In the book, Jennie is a sophomore in college but remembers the crush a friend had on him in the past. There is definitely some sparks that fly between them, but can they overcome Hugh's brother, Brad and his \"issues,\" as he pulls them into them.  Brad: Hugh's brother. Many readers would be angry at the things he does in the book, but I feel sorry for him. It's sad that someone has to live the way that he feels the need to. Anywho, not to ruin it..No spoilers from me! The Plot: Okay. Wow! I thought it was brilliant. I have read Revelation and never dreamed of interpreting it this way. What a great way to think about things. Refreshing! The story unfolds as aliens have come to earth after attacking the sun, which results in a dull orb where our beautiful light used to be. Soon, the aliens attack using really scary dog/lion-like creatures who bite people but leave them alive. Those who are bitten are infected and basically become walking zombies, who attempt to bite and infect the remaining healthy population. The story follows Jennie and her brother and a handful of others as they try to seek safety and freedom from the invading species. I really enjoyed the plot. It unfolded quickly and kept me on my toes. It was easy to follow and I loved the ending. I cannot wait to read more. I pray for a sequel!

Along the way she meets some new people and she sees she has the courage to go on.

She has to take care of herself and he little brother. She has to do some very hard things and really grows up and she struggle to survive. She also begins to have some feelings for Hugh who she knew before the attacks but she isn't sure about him. She has to sort through the lies and deception to see the real man beneath it. Hugh is so amazing. He is smart, sexy and has really gave thought to what the aliens are up to. He and Jennie may just be the key to the survival of humans.I read this book in one sitting as it is a fascinating world the author has created. I have read a few books about aliens here lately but this one is different. It has a zombie like feel to it as well which I love. This is a fresh engaging read that I hated to see end. I really want more of it. I can't wait to see what happens next and how it will end. The book follows three characters that all intertwine later on. Brad, Hugh and Jennie. I like Jennie and Hugh but can't stand Brad. I love how the author added that Jennie's brother didn't like Brad but couldn't say why. Also this may be strange but I love the little things the author added to this book. One example is Jennie and her little brother riding in her car and his sippy cup is making a whistling noise. As a mom I can say that has drove me crazy in a car before. It's little things like that draw you in and you know she has spent time thinking things out.

I mean, with aliens, the sky is the limit (haha) and I was gearing up for a book full of all sorts of freaky (albeit awesome) stuff. Imagine my surprise when there are aliens AND zombies. I was like.. whoah. Hold up. This just got AWESOME. Yes, it is an apocalyptic end of human kind novel, so there is violence and scary elements in this book- like seriously. O.O Scary. But I loved it! The villains were super monstrous and violent- yay! So the terror us up to par. *thumbs up* The story is told in multiple POVs, (which I am okay with because I liked the other characters and their sides of what was going down) but focuses on a teenage girl and takes place AFTER the alien spacecrafts have already shown up and everyone has sort of been lulled into a sense of normality. There are just little spaceships hovering around, but they have not harmed anything (well, they poison the water, but do not become violent), so there are more of a tourist attraction than something many people are panicking about. Then out of nowhere- WHAM! Imminent alien destruction. *throws arms in air* Aliens start ATTACKING people- including jennie (the girl) and her family. Then ZOMBIES and alien creatures happen and.. .and... O.O Well, that's all you will get out of me about that. O.O Jennie and her brother, Mickey, are endearing characters. There are a few other characters I became attached too and wanted to survive the zombie/alien/monster/destruction going on. And there were a few who I wanted to get eaten. or bitten. or just shot.. anyway, I did not like him. :D But everyone else was endearing and caring and sweet. I feel like the ending left an opening for a second book. Maybe? Well, if there is one, I would love to read it, because this book was terrifyingly awesome.

These three weave the tale for us, and it works so well. I thought they were all realistic characters, with logical thoughts and actions. Nothing seemed contrived or forced at all, though Brad didn\u2019t seem to serve a big point in this book, but maybe that\u2019s for a reason.The story was a great read. It had a great level of suspense; it keeps you on the edge of your seat. This is a YA book, so the zombie gore factor isn\u2019t as bad as something you\u2019d see of walking dead, or the like, it\u2019s toned down a bit, but still present. There\u2019s also a bit of religion in this book, but no it\u2019s not a book that only religious people can read, and it\u2019s not preachy or over the top, it\u2019s barely noticeable, and it\u2019s mentioned in the same way other authors use religion to help them weave a story, and it works, in a weird perfect way.This book has zombies, it also holds aliens, and it\u2019s the end of days, Revelations time has come and brought zombies and aliens. You\u2019d think you need to suspend disbelief a lot in order for this story to work but you\u2019d be surprised, you don\u2019t have to, you just read and you get pulled in.I loved this story, it\u2019s a great YA read, and it doesn\u2019t pander to anyone! Check it out!**I was given an ARC in return for an honest review"}, {"userName": "Jessica", "userReviewDate": "Oct 03, 2013", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/2556248-jessica", "userReview": "I was giving a copy of this Amazing book by the author in exchange for my honest review & here it is\u2026\u2026 I absolutely love Sanctuary by Pauline Creeden. How could I not she took two of my favorite interests, aliens & zombies, and put them in one fantastic book. Sanctuary puts a whole new twist on the zombie genre & I haven\u2019t read anything like it before. So many times when reading or watching something about zombies you get the feeling there is no hope, but not in Sanctuary. This story gives you hope that the human race can be saved, although it won\u2019t be easy. Sanctuary is about so many things, survival, faith, hope, love, family, trust, friendship & Pauline did such a wonderful job conveying these feelings through out the book. If you have read other reviews you on Sanctuary you may have seen they said Sanctuary is \u201cFalling Skies meets The Walking Dead\u201d which may be true, but I asked Pauline if that is where she got such a brilliant idea from. This is what she said \u201cActually, no - I was always a Falling Skies fan, but I had never watched The Walking Dead until after I'd written Sanctuary The idea came to my actually from reading my bible\u201d. While there may be some religious references in Sanctuary it is not overly religious. The characters faith is what helps them get through the fact that the world they once new is now gone & that each day could be their last. I don\u2019t do spoilers, so you\u2019ll just have to take my word for it, Sanctuary is an amazing book, that I highly recommend & you get your copy today, because you won\u2019t want to miss out on this amazing read. I can\u2019t wait for the next one #TeamHugh"}, {"userName": "Sharrice Aleshire", "userReviewDate": "Nov 15, 2013", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/2871419-sharrice-aleshire", "userReview": "See my full review on my blogI received a copy of Sanctuary for an honest review.Sanctuary is a zombie, apocalyptic, horror, sci-fi, young adult, religious novel all rolled up into one story. Aliens have landed and after six months of nothing but destroying the human water supply they\u2019re attacking. There are beasts called shisa which are lion-dog like animals who infect humans with an alien virus that causes them to become zombie like and attacking anything and everything and then dying five days later. The human race is running out of time and when Jennie\u2019s mother becomes one of the first to be infected and then her father Jennie knows she has to do everything in her power to keep her brother Micky safe. Hugh a high school science teacher seeing Jennie running for her life steps out of his safety zone to go help. Things quickly pick up pace in the story as Hugh and Jennie work together with the Lord to help find a cure and a way to stop the aliens once and for all.Sanctuary was a very interesting read. I really enjoyed a lot of the book and it was super-fast paced with a lot of interesting science facts and great characters, except for Brad. I really didn\u2019t understand the point of Brad\u2019s perspective being in the book at all except to gain more insight into Hugh\u2019s life and maybe for Hugh and Jennie to grow a stronger relationship. All in all enjoyable although some parts seemed to drag and Brad\u2019s perspective made reading a bit difficult."}, {"userName": "Elizabeth Alsobrooks", "userReviewDate": "Oct 11, 2013", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/18255293-elizabeth-alsobrooks", "userReview": "This is one of those Apocolyptic novels that is marketed as YA and probably has a huge twenty-something fan base since the main character is a college student. But any age group will enjoy this novel. As with many end of the world novels the young heroine struggles with her faith, and is taken in with her little brother by a minister and his wife, so there is a mild Christian theme to the story. Quotes from Revelations work well to tie the themes together.Creeden has put a bit of a spin on the whole Zombie epidemic, adding Aliens as the deliberate impetus for the deadly disease. The characters are realistic and solicit empathy. Sci-fi, zombie or dyoptic fans will enjoy this read. It's a fast read, with a tinge of gore that horror fans won't notice much, but readers under 13 should probably avoid. The only real problem I had with this book is a lack of credible motivation or final outcome. The aliens polluted the water, and dialed down the sun so the popular looking for a new planet because their home planet has been destroyed motive doesn't work. Having the enemy populace kill each other off after they're already dead is an economic even diabolical plan. That part worked for me. I suppose finding out the Alien plans or motivation is for a later book. It clearly wants to be a book 1, but I didn't get the closure I expect from any story, whether it is a series or not. Book Bling gives this novel 4 Stars!"}, {"userName": "Sheila Hollinghead", "userReviewDate": "Nov 25, 2013", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/5252004-sheila-hollinghead", "userReview": "Sanctuary defies placement in one genre. It is post-apocalyptic, horror, suspense, thriller, science fiction rolled into one. And add Christian to that.Pauline Creeden is the author of numerous books. Her most recent, Armored Hearts, co-written with Melissa Turner Lee, was a bestseller in Christian Fantasy.In Sanctuary, a young girl, Jennie must protect her younger brother from alien monsters--huge half lion/half dog-like creatures. But not just from the monsters themselves. The bites of these creatures create zombies--even those of Jennie's own family who also pose a threat.Hugh, a science teacher from Jennie's former school, embarks on his own path that leads him to insights that might save at least part of the human population.Hugh is intelligent, brave, caring and his POV alternates with Jennie's and Hugh's brother, Brad. Jennie is a little weak at times but grows stronger at the end. I was disappointed with Brad. I wanted to see more interaction between Jennie and Brad. As of now, I don't see why he even existed in the story. Perhaps in the sequel, we'll see more of him.The book is well written and well edited with lots of excitement. If you're looking for a thriller, sci-fi, post-apocalyptic book with a Christian flair, this will not disappoint. I highly recommend it."}, {"userName": "Shih-tzus Happens", "userReviewDate": "Oct 01, 2013", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/10100435-shih-tzus-happens", "userReview": "My hat off to you my lady.  I was asked to read this book and give an honest review \u201cAnd out of the smoke locusts came down on the earth and were given power like that of scorpions of the earth.

(Revelation 9:3)\u201dExcerpt From: Creeden, Pauline. \u201cSanctuary.\u201d This book caught me at page one This is a powerful book packed full of love, courage,excitement and scary. I cried and I laughed and I panicked  I had to rush through it in order to review it on time. But this I shall reread at a much slower pace.  I normally don't read this type of book I am more the vampires werewolves and oh my kind of reader. But I truly loved this book It's one of the best I have read in a long time.  The Author takes you on an adventure step by step you can fall easily into Jennie's shoes. I could not put this book down.  Every detail and every aspect of this book seemed so true.  If I had this book in paperback I would frame it and hang it in my office and cherish it for a lifetime  From beginning to end it's action packed. And I love the cliff hanger at the end. The author left us to truly beg for more. Please do write book two I am truly hooked.
