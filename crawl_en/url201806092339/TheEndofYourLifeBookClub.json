I have also - since reading this book bought AT LEAST a DOZEN copies ....or more ( Not at full price)... but in perfect condition to give to close friends... heck -- I've sent the book to a few people on this site.

To pass the time, Mr. Shwalbe asks his mother, \"What are you reading?\"Fortunately, Mr. Schwalbe and his mother had always shared a love of reading and enjoyed spirited conversations about their favorite books. While the endless chemo treatments proceed, and his mother's disease progresses, the two make their way through books of all kinds, from the popular (The No. 1 Ladies' Detective Agency) to the obscure (Eleanor Rathbone and the Politics of Conscience).The mother-son book club not only serves to pass the time, but it deepens their relationship and provides an outlet for discussing uncomfortable end-of-life issues. They read Randy Pausch's The Last Lecture and Joan Didion's The Year of Magical Thinking. With his \"book club,\" Mr. Schwalbe gives a wonderful gift to his mother, an outlet for discussing issues that make most people around a sick person uncomfortable -- and a way to talk about something other than being sick.I also appreciated that Mr. Schwalbe, a person of no professed faith, does not denigrate the books his mother cherishes at the end of her life -- The Book of Common Prayer and Daily Strengths For Daily Needs. He comes to see not only the good they did his mother, but how their underlying messages shaped his mother's character all her life. (She was a well-known activist for refugee causes. She was raising funds for a library in Afghanistan at the end of her life.)Mr. Schwalbe's portrait of his extraordinary mother is respectful and well balanced. He acknowledges all the people who loved her, honored her and cherished her. He hints at frustrations (\"How, I wondered, could anyone always want to talk to everyone?\"), but it's clear that he and his mother shared a close and loving relationship. This is a son's gentle tribute to his mother, a memoir that shows how one family negotiated the reality of death and dying with creativity, love and respect."}, {"userName": "Claire", "userReviewDate": "Jul 08, 2013", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/7321073-claire", "userReview": "I truly wanted to enjoy this book. I read this book for a book club and at first I thought it was a good choice. It sounded like something I would really want to sink my teeth into, however, I just did not find it interesting. It is appalling that I was 90% of the way through and telling myself, don't worry, she must die soon and it will all be over (I feel like a terrible person). I appreciate that Will Schwalbe's mother appears to have been a woman who championed many valuable causes and did great things, however, the description of her in this book doesn't even make her sound human. That is due to the writing than the woman- it felt like she was being portrayed as some saint-like creature. The description of the Mother/Son relationship didn't make me feel emotional, the book club books were not discussed in enough detail to make me want to read them and it seemed like a lot of this book was screaming 'look how privileged we are'. Although it seems like the Mother did a lot for refugees, it often comes across that she was detached and cold towards her own children. At best, reading the book made me feel like I had trespassed at someone's funeral/wake at worst it made me feel like I was participating in a very dull book club. Perhaps I am being overly harsh, but would really not recommend this to anyone else and believe this was published mainly due to author connections.Rant over!"}, {"userName": "Holly", "userReviewDate": "Oct 04, 2012", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/4763049-holly", "userReview": "The book discussions were cursory, at best. I hadn't intended to find myself reading a memoir of a parent's pancreatic cancer; call me oversensitive (and a sucker), but books like this make me FURIOUS! The author seems like a nice man and all, but what exactly is the draw for readers? It's his personal memoir and story of his mother, and it's actually really, really boring. The book club-thing is a gimmick - Schwalbe works in publishing, after all (i.e., he had connections and help getting it published). If it had been my memoir I doubt it would have been accepted:\"Hey, Mom! Let's you and me read something edgy like Pynchon or something sweet like Alice Munro before we dart off to a benefit or the symphony or to humanitarian work in the Third World - oh sorry, what? you're dying and cannot get out of bed and are in constant pain and wasting away in starvation and subsisting in a perpetual morphine haze? Have hope! Reading fiction will put it all into perspective for us!\"(So is it true that there were drug trials for pancreatic cancer treatment accepting patients in March 2009?

I lost my mother to cancer six years ago, and I really envy how Will and his mother Mary Ann were able to find a common language to discuss the questions of life, death, and the possibility of the hereafter.I wish my mother and I had had that common language. And I wish my stepfather, through his own bitterness and lashing out, hadn't poisoned my process of mourning by making some very cruel statements. I'm still processing the loss six years later, as a result. Reading this book may help bring peace to many people. I recognize how good it is, but it's brought up a lot of angst for me. But at the same time, it's helped me to rid myself of a lot of misplaced guilt that I had been placing on my own head. I do tend to do this; to beat myself up unjustly. I need to stop doing that.But I remember the time in the hospital room when my mother and I acknowledged death's approach and our love for each other.

Mary Anne Schwalbe was diagnosed with pancreatic cancer in 2007, and she and her son spend time sharing books and holding informal book club chats, partly because they were both avid readers and partly to take Mary Anne's mind off of her illness. So it's a book about books, but it's also about the lessons Will learned from his mom. I would recommend this book to any book lovers, but also to those who are coping with the serious illness of a family member.\"We're all in the end-of-our life book club, whether we acknowledge it or not; each book we read may well be the last, each conversation the final one.\""}, {"userName": "Nicole", "userReviewDate": "Oct 24, 2012", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/2519765-nicole", "userReview": "There were so many problems with this book. First, the author so worshiped his mother that the reader never got to know the real her. She was on the board of numerous international organizations that help refugees, orphans, and women. She traveled extensively, often coming home quite ill. She seemed to take this as part of her working overseas and refused to take the full course of antibiotics. (The author reports this as if it is heroic rather than foolish.) She also supposedly talks to everyone she comes into contact with, listening intently and asking questions, always with a radiant smile. Once she is diagnosed with cancer, she describes her days as \"good\" or \"not so good\"; she never talks of pain, but rather discomfort. She continues to travel and tirelessly championing the building of a library in Afghanistan. She attends her grandchildren's birthday parties even though she is supposed to avoid large groups of people who could make her sicker. Even though she only has months to live, she insists that her daughter take a job in Switzerland, as she plans on visiting when she vacations in London. Throughout it all, the author never shares if his mother is scared, angry, or any other negative emotion. (He, on the other hand, often bawls or gets sulky.) Because she is presented as Rebecca of Sunnybrook Farms, the reader has no idea just how sick she is and she remains a detached character, not someone to root for. The tiny glimpses into the author's childhood show a mother who was not present for her children, neither emotionally nor physically. (The \"turtle\" incident is unbelievable. Don't get me started...) But, the author continues to extol his mother's virtues. (It was strange that he wrote so little about his father. He says in the intro that his father's story was his to tell, but, given that this is a memoir, Dad's absence was quite striking.) So, I didn't love the mother (nor the son), but I could enjoy this book because of all the books they shared, right? Well, no. A number of the books didn't interest me because they seemed too dark. I had read some of the books that they read---and disliked them all. (The funny thing was that I don't remember the author talking about a book that they didn't like.) I did write down some of their choices to check out here on GoodReads, so I might find something from their lists that I like. We'll see. Finally, the author worked as an editor for over twenty years, yet this book sorely needed editing. That made me wonder if the same book written by someone outside of publishing would have seen the light of day. I guess it pays to have friends in high places.

I didn't realise this before agreeing to review the book and the parallel experiences made it a challenging read. Especially as her birthday has just gone and there are only three months till the anniversary of her death. She was on my mind even before reading this. Nanny and I never had a book club as such, but we both read a lot and often shared/talked about books. She is intertwined so much with my idea of reading that I will forever think of her when i'm siting with a book in my hand. So one of the comments Will Schwalbe reported his mother telling him really struck me: \u2018That\u2019s one of the things books do. They help us talk. But they also give us something we can all talk about when we don\u2019t want to talk about ourselves\u2019. In essence, that is what Will is doing with this book, using the selections made for their book club to tell the reader about what his mother, himself, and his family were going through. But it is also what he was doing within the book, both he and his mother were using the varied titles they chose to tell each other things they couldn\u2019t say out loud, or raise topics they might not have otherwise been able to address directly. In this way, they discussed death, pain, religion, suffering, justice, love. And yet, despite these weighty subjects, it felt like the book didn\u2019t go deep enough. So much of the reported time was spent in hospital or doctor waiting rooms and it read like a waiting room conversation, for the most part superficial and short. There were some moments of deeper meaning but it seemed to me that Will Schwalbe didn\u2019t address either the books he and his mother read or tell the reader enough about why they were important. Perhaps he wasn\u2019t truly ready or prepared to go that far, but it makes the book feel lacking. Certainly the books, despite being the focus of the title, were little more than background. I\u2019d not have minded this if it meant more about the inspiring, wonderful person that Mary Anne Schwalbe was, but the hole was not filled by her or anything else. I was disappointed because I felt the project could have been so much more.The most useful and positive aspect of the book was the person centred nature of the care that Mary Anne Schwalbe chose for herself. Throughout the book, she made decisions about her medical interventions and how she wanted her end of life period to look and feel like. In that, and all other things, her family seemed to support her wishes and her health in the way that she wanted. She remained in charge of her own body, within the framework of her cancer. As such, this might give the strength to others with illness to make decisions about their own care or allow their families to see how important it can be to manage cancer in the way that best suits each individual, even if it means some painful choices. One book that they read was \u2018The Etiquette of Illness\u2019 by Sue Halpern and Will included the following checklist:1) Ask: \u2018Do you want to talk about how you\u2019re feeling?\u2019 (instead of asking straight away and putting the individual on the spot about answering)2) Don\u2019t ask if there\u2019s anything you can do. Suggest things, or if it\u2019s not intrusive, just do them.3) You don\u2019t have to talk all the time. Sometimes just being there is enough.These were elements we put in place during the care of my nanny and which I also use in my work in the healthcare sector. Of all the books that are mentioned, this is the one I think others might find the most useful."}, {"userName": "Alexandrea", "userReviewDate": "Oct 07, 2012", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/979973-alexandrea", "userReview": "An absolutely wonderfully written book that is not just the personal experience of Will Schwalbe. This book explores the power of books, reading them, discussing them and intagrating them into our lives and the lives of others.

I, undoubtedly like many others, couldn't help but grow attached to Mary Ann Schwalbe, a bibliophile who prefers to start off a book by reading the ending first. She seems to convey the type of woman that every girl would dream of growing up to be - an avid reader and theatre enthusiast, a loving mother and grandmother, but also a humanitarian who spends a great portion of her life in the most dangerous zones of places like Afghanistan and Pakistan.Schwalbe successfully takes turns alternating between periods of grief, nostalgia, and sentimentality to periods of enlightenment and inspiration. He'll make you cry and laugh on the same page, but he'll also make you think twice about things that would originally cross your mind for a mere couple of seconds - things like health care, happiness, death, fate, and finding your purpose in life. His writing is often simple, and flows with such elegance that the words will linger in your mind for hours to come. \u201cMom taught me not to look away from the worst but to believe that we can all do better. She never wavered in her conviction that books are the most powerful tool in the human arsenal, that reading all kinds of books, in whatever format you choose - electronic (even though that wasn't for her) or printed, or audio - is the grandest entertainment, and also is how you take part in human conversation. Mom taught me that you can make a difference in the world and that books really do matter: they're how we know what we need to do in life, and how we tell others. Mom also showed me, over the course of two years and dozens of books and hundreds of hours in hospitals, that books can be how we get closer to each other, and stay close, even in the case of a mother and son who were very close to begin with, and even after one of them has died.\u201d"}, {"userName": "Diane ", "userReviewDate": "Nov 26, 2012", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/143168-diane", "userReview": "A loving tribute to life and to reading.

Some parts are hysterically funny, and others are crushingly sad.\"The End of Your Life Book Club\" details the final two years of Mary Ann Schwalbe, who died after battling metastatic pancreatic cancer. In the pantheon of cancers, pancreatic is one of the most deadly, especially once it spreads to other organs, the liver, in Mrs Schwalbe's case. She is a woman unaccustomed to sitting still. She was an educator, a philanthropist, and a champion for human rights, especially for refugee women and children in war-torn nations. She thought nothing of flying to Thailand to work among the sick and wounded for six months. Her spirit was indomitable, and it remained so till the very end.Author Will Schwalbe had a remarkable career in publishing, working for Scribner's, Hyperion, and other major imprints. He got his love of books from his mother.The End of Your Life Book Club had two members: Will and his mother. It started almost by accident. Will took his mother to her chemotherapy sessions. While they waited to be called back--and during the hours the treatments took--the two talked about books. At first, they touched on what each other had been reading. As time progressed, they took it to a new level, both of them reading the same book, so that they could discuss it while the medicine dripped slowly into Mary Ann's veins. Their discussions were interesting and very literate, but the true bliss in this book is how discussing a work of fiction could elicit a story from their real lives. Sometimes it was a shared family memory; other times, Mary Ann described one of her many adventures, or Will talked about authors he'd published, or his new dot-com business. Over the two years they shared their club, we get a sense of how amazingly generous a spirit Mary Ann had, and the love she had for her husband and three grown children. She had a strong faith--a Presbyterian--and Will didn't. This didn't bother her too much. She mentioned with a laugh that God hears heathens' prayers too.The whole family is remarkably educated, and notable for their achievements. She insists they live their lives unabated. At day's end, though, they all rally around their mother. Mary Ann didn't let cancer slow her down much. She managed to travel, both domestically and abroad. She was adamant that she wanted to see her grandchildren grow up. Sadly, the point came where chemotherapy no longer worked, and her tumors grew rampantly. Mary Ann never whined or lamented \"WHY ME??\" She plowed forward. She made funeral arrangements, wrote letters for her grandchildren to open when she was gone, and she put her affairs in order. She did NOT go gentle, to paraphrase Dylan Thomas. When it was time to stop fighting, she accepted her fate, and made the most of her remaining time on earth. Even when she was confined to bed, she and Will talked books. She read until the day she slipped from consciousness, and she died, knowing her family would miss her, but they would be fine.This is an extraordinary book. At its core, it tells the story of Will and Mary Ann's book club. Even if this book just covered their readings and literary discussions, it would be worth a read. (My favorite Book Club topic was the proffered theory that one could either like C.S. Lewis' \"Chronicles of Narnia\" series, or J.R.R. Tolkien's Hobbit tales, but not both; and that while Lewis insisted the Narnia books were not Christian allegory, Tolkien claimed his were (Will was a Tolkien; his brother was a Lewis))What Will Schwalbe does so brilliantly is use the book club as a framework upon which to sculpt his truly inspiring and amazing mother's life, and the family she loved and cherished, eccentricities and all. Mary Ann Schwalbe was one of a kind: she was whip-smart and educated, generous, fearless, and yet always quick to speak to anybody: from the custodian to the Chief of Medicine, Mrs Schwalbe had a kind word for everyone. This is not always an easy book. It doesn't dwell excessively on the gorier aspects of cancer, but it's always there, always in the background: we know that this remarkable woman is going to die from a horrible disease. Even as the end approaches, Mary Ann Schwalbe had a surprise or two. Before she left Memorial Sloan-Kettering and entered Hospice home care, she had Will fill out a duplicate \"Do Not Resuscitate\" form. He penned in her name: Mary Anne Schwalbe. She gently corrected him: there was no \"e\" on the end of \"Ann.\" His whole life, he'd thought her name was Mary Anne. It seemed a testament to her life force that her DNR form had a scratched-out letter. Mary Ann's death is not what makes \"The End of Your Life Book Club\" so engrossing; it's her splendid, generous, exquisitely lived life.Highly recommended."}, {"userName": "Mari Anne", "userReviewDate": "Oct 11, 2012", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/1663741-mari-anne", "userReview": "I started out loving the book and the story behind it... who wouldn't love a book about books.

I could go on and on). This one however, grew cold on me about half way through. Maybe it was the endless recitation of the cancer treatments or the preachiness that creeps in toward the end that bothered me, but I found that this book morphed less into a lovely memoir about his mom and their book club and more into a platform for his personal needs and views.

The sentence stating that May Ann's cancer is treatable, not curable, lets us know at the start what the end result will be. Somewhere early on, Will admits that he knows the outcome but there will be some time before death comes. He often says what he wants \"is Mom not to be dying\" and I agree. Mary Ann is a remarkable woman who did remarkable things. She was a hard working member of International Rescue Committee and she often journeyed to Kabul and all over Afghanistan. One of her life's dreams was to see a library built in Kabul. One touching moment for me was when Will meant to tell his mother \"I love you\" but instead told her how proud of her he was. This was something I had never thought to tell my own parents. As children and later as an adult, my father and mother often said these words to me. How I wish I had said those same words to them."}, {"userName": "Cher", "userReviewDate": "Jul 16, 2013", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/4776032-cher", "userReview": "This was unfortunately, not what I thought I was signing up for, though it was not without it's merits. I was expecting a story of a mother and son saying good-bye to each other, but with a heavy focus on reads they shared and discussions regarding these books. In reality, there are only tiny snippets about books - rarely was it enough to garner any real interest on my part. So, if like me, you came here looking for a book about books, keep looking.Things I enjoyed: There are many great quotes from this book, something that adds to any read for me. I did not resent the family, as some reviewers do, for their financial success. It irks me to no end that our country is becoming a culture that punishes success and rewards mediocrity. I respect successful people and do not resent them for the financial rewards for which they have worked. As a whole, this can be seen as a case study on how one dying person preferred to be treated and spoken to. While you cannot apply this as a generalization to everyone, it gives you ideas for what might be helpful in these awkward, difficult situations. For many reasons, I enjoyed the main character, \"Mom\"/Mary Anne. The mother, whom the autobiography (yes, auto, more on that later) is based on was an incredible woman that accomplished many things, touched many lives, and proves how much of a difference one person can make. She was also an utter control freak. That's ok - that is how she got so much done, and this \"flaw\", if you see it that way, made her more believable. If she had been painted as a perfect angel this book would have been too nauseating to stomach. I applauded how she supported her children when they came forth regarding their homosexuality. Other parents with her strong religious foundation may not have been so receptive, and I respected her more for this. Being a control freak and quite opinionated, there are snippets of her thoughts scattered throughout, some of which I found thought provoking and agreeable. For example, when buying art, she preferred to purchase from a young artist (career wise, not age) as more than likely, the financial sale would mean more to them than it would for a more established artist.Things I disliked: Again, mom was a control freak. And yes, I listed this under both the like and dislike section, lol. I have no doubt that the majority of this book was written by the woman herself rather than her son - the BULK majority, just as it was really her voice writing the blog and not him. A control freak simply does not give free reign over something that is so integral and directly tied to them, and she knew the book would be written. Her control tendencies made me twitch when they spilled over to some of her thoughts/snippets, such as she feels it is ok for a woman to stay home and raise her kids, or it is ok for her to be career driven, etc. However, she then states she does not feel it is right for someone that procured an advanced degree to THEN later decide to be a stay at home wife or mom without working, as they owe it to society to keep working after receiving so much education. Bullshit. People change. What does not change, is someone's right to live their life however they choose.Which brings me to what made me want to poke sticks in my eyes. This book is a long, gushing love letter to Obama. As a libertarian that passionately values small government and individual rights/liberties, I can promise you that is NOT what I thought I was picking up to read. I found these segments (many, many segments) to be nauseating and a needless distraction. Pacing was also a problem. The very first part of the book was ok, and the ending was strong, but the vast majority of the book was tedious and slow. I found myself several times looking forward to it being over -- never a good sign.All in all, this was a mixed package. In many ways I did not enjoy it and would not recommend it to people of like minded literary tastes. That being said, there were so many quotes that I loved and some redeeming qualities. Favorite quote: \u201cWe're all in the end-of-your-life book-club, whether we acknowledge it or not; each book we read may well be the last, each conversation the final one.\u201d I was wavering between 2 (it was ok) and 3 (I liked it) stars when finishing it, and with just a few short pages to go, the author threw in one last love note to Obama. Yeahhh, definitely just a 2."}, {"userName": "Nancy", "userReviewDate": "Apr 28, 2013", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/108416-nancy", "userReview": "I imagine that a reader's reaction to this book will be determined by their expectations. I wanted it to be a substantive book about books. It was not: it was a lovely memorial to Schwalbe's impressive mother and a tribute to his affection and respect for her. I wanted it to offer illuminating discussion between two people who used books as a therapy during a difficult illness. It did not. I am afraid this is a cynical reaction, but knowing that the author comes from the publishing industry, I felt that his litany of book titles was nothing more than a device to frame the story about his mother and create a secondary subject to make the book more marketable. Despite dropping the titles and plot summaries of dozens and dozens of books I never felt that Schwalbe recounted any meaningful conversations based upon the reading list he shared with his mother.A perfect example of this was the very first book mentioned in the memoir: Wallace Stegner's CROSSING TO SAFETY. Despite mentioning a lifelong family friendship that blossomed from his mother's college days, he breezed through his plot summary of Stegner's work without discussing the personal parallels, or mentioning the book's theme of the transformative power of friendship. The End of Your Life Book Club was a lovely valentine to the author's mother but, for me, nothing more."}, {"userName": "Clarissa", "userReviewDate": "Dec 16, 2012", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/1407972-clarissa", "userReview": "Maybe I'm a cold person because I didn't find this book touching, or maybe I have discerning tastes and I can smell when a former publisher called in a favor to a colleague a mile a way. The two members of this book club are Schwalbe and his mother, Mary Ann. Almost from the get-go I felt no bond with these people. Mary Ann was an admissions counselor at Harvard, in addition to holding similar positions at other Ivy League schools in addition to doing all kinds of humanitarian refugee work in all kinds of dangerous places. While Mary Ann did all sorts of good things for refugees; the details of which go on and on for pages, it also wasn't uncommon for her family to just have tubs of caviar at christmas time that her neighbors just dropped off. She talks about buying swanky real-estate on a whim the way I talk about impulse buying cookware at Target. I don't begrudge people their riches and I guess this is really not what put me off the most about her. I think what made her unlikeable to me is that for all the kindnesses she did for strangers abroad, she seemed like a distant person to the closest people in her life. She comes off as humorless, as is conveyed in a retelling by Schwalbe of a Christmas where they gathered around Mary Ann as she read the whole christmas story, and as little kids are prone to do.. they broke out into a giggling fit. Not only was she apparently furious at the time and threatened to revoke Christmas, over THIRTY YEARS LATER when Schwalbe brings it up she is still not the slightest bit amused. And did I mention she is well into the fourth stage of pancreatic cancer at this point?The whole book alternates between recollections like the above and moments where Schwalbe just elevates his mother so high on a pedestal. Freely interspersed between all this is the wisdom of someone dying of terminal cancer ( SPOILER ALERT: Did you know you should savor every moment? Did you know you should live every day like it's your last? Did you know that you just don't know what's around the corner?) Wow, I guess the cat is out of the bag.As far as the book aspect goes, I feel like it was added in throughout as an afterthought. Usually after Mary Ann dispenses some Hallmark, dying person wisdom. LIke \"live every day like you last.. Just like in 'Crossing to Safety' !\". Also, most of the books they read together are ones I strongly dislike or haven't read.I would be lying if I said I didn't tear up a bit at the end- but the topic of one's beloved mother dying a slow death is sad no matter how awkwardly it's written and I couldn't help but think of my own mother, also a book lover, and feel a surge of love and an urgency to spend more time with her.

The members are the author and his mother Mary Anne, who has been diagnosed with pancreatic cancer. Her disease is treatable, but not cureable. There will be no miracles; the most she can hope for is more time.So, to pass the hours during doctor visits and chemotherapy, the Schwalbes decide to read and discuss books. We didn't read only \"great books,\" we read casually and promiscuously and whimsically.Besides being a great love letter to reading, this book serves as a wonderful tribute to Mary Anne Schwalbe, a fascinating and remarkable woman who traveled the globe for various human rights causes. Even her final weeks of life were spent crusading for healthcare reform and attempting to set up a library in Afghanistan. She always read the end of a book first because she couldn't wait to find out how things would turn out.Unfortunately, there is no surprise ending to this book. Though the author doesn't dwell in despair and sentimentality, expect to shed a few tears during the last chapter. If you've been fortunate enough to have a parent with whom you've shared a love of reading, this book should have some meaning to you.We all have a lot more to read than we can read and a lot more to do than we can do. Still, one of the things I learned from Mom is this: Reading isn't the opposite of doing; it's the opposite of dying. I will never be able to read my mother's favorite books without thinking of her - and when I pass them on and recommend them, I'll know that some of what made her goes with them; that some of my mother will live on in those readers, readers who may be inspired to love the way she loved and do their own version of what she did in the world."}, {"userName": "Eve", "userReviewDate": "May 01, 2014", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/1283951-eve", "userReview": "\u201cWe're all in the end-of-your-life book-club, whether we acknowledge it or not; each book we read may well be the last, each conversation the final one.\u201d\nThis is one of the most beautifully written memoirs I have ever read. When Schwalbe\u2019s 73-year-old mother, Mary Anne, is diagnosed with stage 4 pancreatic cancer, she determines to continue living her life at the same wistful speed despite grim life expectancy statistics. A retired teacher and active humanitarian, her son graciously introduces readers to this magnificent woman by means of their two-person book club, spontaneously contrived during Mary Anne\u2019s lengthy chemo therapy sessions in hospital. Both avid readers and lovers of literature, their book selections are never haphazard, and make for deep, philosophical discussions about death, living a meaningful life, and leaving the world better than you found it. In the process, the two form an even stronger bond, each using books as both teachers and healers on Mary Anne\u2019s journey to death, and Will\u2019s journey after her death. I love books about books, and reading about people who are just as fond of literature warms my heart. It reminds me that in ancient times and even far into the future, there have and will always be people who are in love with the written word. Reading is how we can relate to each other and take part in the human conversation. It\u2019s a huge responsibility, but so necessary! The way Schwalbe paints Mary Anne\u2019s final moments, surrounded by family and countless volumes of much loved books, was so elegant and beautiful.

What kept me interested was his amazing mother, who seemed to define the meaning of the word kind. In her long life she helped so many others with her selfless acts, including getting a library started for schoolchildren in Kabul. It was evident as well that she passed the kindness gene on to her son, as he was just the perfect companion to her.The book titles mentioned as part of their two person book club were mostly ones I haven't read, but many are now on my TBR (thanks Will!).

This was a shock to Will's entire family, as Mary Anne had always been a true force of nature, a crusader for humanitarian rights all over the globe, once the director of admissions at Harvard and Radcliffe, and truly an inspiration to everyone she encountered.Mary Anne and her husband, Douglas, raised their three children with very strong principles of courtesy, faith, learning, and family, as well as a lifelong love of books. So it was not at all unusual when Will, sitting with his mother in the waiting room of the Memorial Sloan-Kettering Cancer Center, asked Mary Anne, \"What are you reading?\" That conversation started the two on an incredible journey of reading, exploring new and favorite authors, and discussing topics far beyond the books they read.As a voracious reader, I absolutely fell in love with this book on so many levels. The books that Will and Mary Anne read spanned many genres\u2014fiction, mysteries, poetry, plays, psychology, religion, philosophy\u2014and I was pleased that I had read a large number of the books they touched on, although I don't think it's necessary to have done so. As they read, Will recounted memories of his mother and her amazing life, as well as his childhood, interspersing them with the day-to-day challenges faced by a person living with \"treatable but not curable\" cancer.\"When you're with someone who is dying, you may need to celebrate the past, live the present, and mourn the future all at the same time,\" Will discovered at one point during this period of time. As he and his mother learned about new authors and revisited favorites from the past, he also learned a lot about his mother in the process\u2014what motivated her crusade for humanitarian rights, what drove her to make each person she encountered feel as if they were special, and how she felt about dealing with her illness.Schwalbe, who was editor-in-chief of Hyperion Books before leaving to found Cookstr.com, is a fantastic writer who makes his mother a vivid presence in this book. You feel fortunate to be a part of their conversations, and the things they discussed definitely made me think. But of course, you know where the book will end, so there is always a tinge of melancholy as you follow the path of Mary Anne's illness and the remarkable strength she showed.As I've said before, I'm a huge sap, so this book was a powerful, inspirational, and emotional one for me, but so wonderfully written that I read the entire book in a day. This book reinforced my love for life and the importance of telling those you care about how much you love them and how proud of them you are, but also it reinforced how much I love reading. How can you not fall in love with a book that celebrates the love of books and reading?One quote from Alan Bennett's The Uncommon Reader, which Will included in the book, really sums The End of Your Life Book Club up for me:\"Pass the time?\" said the Queen. \"Books are not about passing the time. They're about other lives. Other worlds.\"I am grateful to Will Schwalbe for opening up his life and his mother's world in this book.

It was hard to relate to them. They're in a world far, far different from mine, elite New Yorkers who travel the world, head up relief organizations, and have the kinds of friends who can donate a million dollars for their designated charity group! Reading it, I also felt guilty because most of these books I've not read; as an English major, I want to be more well-read, and I'm disappointed in myself for not staying on the cutting edge of what is popular or well-known. Then again, as an English teacher, I do read lots of YA and children's books! Right away, I hated the quote in the third chapter: \"Permanent is not; impermanent is not; a self is not; not a self [is not]; clean is not; not clean is not; happy is not; suffering is not.\" I HATE this kind of philosophy. You know what? Suffering IS. I liked his comment about how bound books have presence because of their physicality. \"I often seek electronic books, but they never come after me. They may make me feel, but I can't feel them. They are all soul with no flesh, no texture, and no weight. They can get in your head but can't whack you upside it.\" As someone who has been known to stumble across a book by accident and be drawn into reading it, I understand what he means.On p. 44, he quoted some really good advice for dealing with the ill, and I liked his insight about his conversational techniques: \"I often forget that other people's stories aren't simply introductions to my own more engaging, more dramatic, more relevant, and better-told tales, but rather ends in themselves, tales i can learn from or repeat or dissect or savor.\" In contrast, he admires his mother's ability to listen without interrupting and to ask questions \"to get people to talk more about how they felt or what they'd learned or who they'd met or what they thought would happen next.\"About books: \"They help us talk. But they also give us something we all can talk about when we don't want to talk about ourselves.\" I also had to laugh when he described in his house one way to get out of doing a chore was to be engrossed in reading! His mother shared about the importance of reading about cruelty: \"When you read bout it, it's easier to recognize it. . . People can be cruel in lots of ways, some very subtle. I think that's why we all need to read about it. . . You need to learn to recognize these things right from teh start. Evil almost always starts with small cruelties.\" (p. 151)I was struck by this quote from another book, Kokoro: \"Loneliness is the price we have to pay for being born in this modern world, so full of freedom, independence and our own egotistical selves.\" In discussing Olive Kitteridge, his mother says, \"Loneliness can kill people - in different ways can actually make you die. olive's private view is that life depends on what she thinks of as 'big bursts' and 'little bursts.' Big bursts are things like marriage or children, intimacies that keep you afloat, but these big bursts hold dangerous, unseen currents. Which is why you need the little bursts as well: a friendly clerk at Bradlee's, let's say, or the waitress at Dunkin' Donuts who knows how you like your coffee.\" I agree with that need for personal connections in little things.Though this was more of a record of his mother's illness and their relationship, it did remind me that I would really like to be able to be in a book discussion group, especially with someone I love."}, {"userName": "Brenda", "userReviewDate": "Feb 25, 2014", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/2337007-brenda", "userReview": "The devastation the Schwalbe family felt when their mother, Mary Anne was diagnosed with pancreatic cancer was intense.
