I had to! Jamie was quickly becoming the helpless female who needed some man to ride to her rescue. Not what you would expect for a woman who owned her own security firm. In The Kill Wire, Jamie comes across stronger and more self-sufficient but Marc and Adam are still not far behind, worrying about her, trying to be the protective male, etc. Marc even picks up this horrible habit of calling Jamie \"babe.\" Seriously? So while Jamie seemed a bit more on equal footing with the men, I really want to see a book without Marc or Adam being more than a voice at the other end of the phone while Jamie shows us that she should be running her own security firm and starring in her own book series.A copy of this book was provided by NetGalley and Random House Publishing Group - Alibi in exchange for an honest review."}, {"userName": "Mark Easter", "userReviewDate": "Feb 18, 2018", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/3230541-mark-easter", "userReview": "Originally, I wrote a scathing review. Then I felt bad about it and scanned back through the book thinking maybe I missed something or over reacted. I did. It was not as bad as I was left feeling after finishing the first read. It was just that the run around with Marc Sandoval stretched credulity and was irritating, \"babe\", and Jamie did not seem quite so smart or as real as in earlier books, and the document facilty sequence was uttlerly unbelievable, and Barrett's cameo appearance was lacking. I guess all that left me disappointed and colored the rest. So, it was a decent read for the genre but not what I had hoped for. I am looking forward to a killer book 6, Nichole."}, {"userName": "Anne Robinson", "userReviewDate": "Mar 07, 2018", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/34719980-anne-robinson", "userReview": "I am beginning to wish that I hadn\u2019t stuck with this series. Whilst the main plot in each book is a pretty good and exciting thriller, the longer term arc of Jamie\u2019s relationships with her men is getting increasingly annoying. Do I assume that she gets to have incredibly hot sex in book six to make up for all this coitus interruptus in every book so far? If not..... well...."}, {"userName": "Bea", "userReviewDate": "Mar 18, 2018", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/59205124-bea", "userReview": "I was very excited to be given the opportunity to read this Jamie Sinclair novel as I read the one prior to this one and wanted MORE!I thoroughly enjoyed this book and the author did a great job picking up where the 4th book left off. I also appreciate that each book has a complete ending, which is very much to my liking!Like some other reviewers, however, Jamie seems to be getting more and more dependent on one man or the other. She is starting to seem incapable of handling situations on her own without a male to back her up. Is there not another female out there who could provide similar backup? I realize that a lot of the current series with a female lead include one or more males who add to the story line. But, at the same time, the female lead is capable of doing a lot on her own. It seems every time Jamie goes off on her own, she gets into deeper trouble and then, voila, a male appears to rescue her.That doesn\u2019t mean I didn\u2019t like the story, it just means that I wish Jamie would develop more ability on her own and show us what a woman can do without a man! Perhaps, for me, part of the problem is that she goes back and forth and forth and back about which man she cares the most for. So, could we please settle on one or the other as her love interest and for goodness sakes let them finally get together? The story itself is quite believable, quite thrilling and kept me turning pages to find out what would happen next. This series is definitely worth reading if you enjoy strong female leads, twists and turns, and of course a stand-alone book in a series. I will definitely be looking forward to number 6 in this series! I received a copy of The Kill Wire through NetGalley in exchange for an honest review. My thanks to Random House - Alibi and Nichole Christoff for the opportunity."}, {"userName": "Debbie Oxier", "userReviewDate": "Mar 10, 2018", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/21813445-debbie-oxier", "userReview": "Fantastic!I love this series! Investigator Jamie Sinclair is working with DEA agent Marc Sandoval to find his missing ex-wife, mother of his son, Cody. Elena was in law enforcement as well and it appeared her disappearance was connected to a woman, Lucy, in the Witness Protection Program. Lucy had testified against bad guy, Max Ribinski, who managed to discover where Lucy was and he was now gunning for Elena and Lucy, who were on the run. Jamie is aware that Marc has feelings for her while, at the same time, a certain soldier named Barritt is looking forward to spending his leave with Jamie. This story hits the ground running and never let's up. I couldn't put it down. Jamie is independent, determined, and goes the extra mile for those she cares about. I've enjoyed watching her character develop over the course of the series. The fact she has two men vying for her affection adds an interesting twist to each story. Marc doesn't have the greatest reputation but he's crazy about Jamie and has vowed to become the type of man she deserves. Barritt is a soldier, restricted by wherever he happens to be stationed at the time, or he'd be with Jamie if she'd have him. I like both male leads as the author has done a good job of making both of them appealing. I'm anxious to discover if Jamie will end up with one of them or maybe neither one. Highly recommend this series."}, {"userName": "Sharon Grow", "userReviewDate": "Feb 17, 2018", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/9167903-sharon-grow", "userReview": "This is book number 5 in the excellent thriller series starring private eye turned security specialist, Jamie Sinclair. Jamie has more business than she can handle, but Marc Sandoval, DEA agent, intrudes into Jamie\u2019s life again and asks for help. Jamie wants to say no, but Marc explains that he is trying to locate Elena, the mother of his six-year-old son. Elena did not show up to pick up their son and has now disappeared. He knows at one time Elena was dealing with substance abuse and hopes that Jamie can find Elena before he does and is forced to arrest her. Jamie knows that taking this case may put her in further jeopardy with her boyfriend, military police officer Adam Barrett. Adam is a \u201cby the book, i.e. law\u201d professional and doesn\u2019t understand when Jamie bends the law to solve a case. Jamie is a strong, take charge individual who gets the job done. I have read the entire series and would recommend that you start with the first book \u201cThe Kill List\u201d, but if not, you will be given enough information about the characters that you will not feel lost. Ms. Christoff\u2019s writing and characters are gritty, full of strong emotions and deal with life and death situations. I received a free copy of this book and voluntarily chose to give an honest review and I highly recommend both this author and the series.

I adore this series, and I requested this ARC from Net Galley within seconds of seeing it. In books 1-3 I was a solid Barrett fan. Book 4 had me very torn but leaning closer to Marc. In this story I finally found my favorite, and I am both sad that he didn't get the girl and happy that she picked who she did. It makes no sense, but it's the truth of things. I really want Jamie committed to one guy and finally getting the attention and romantic sizzle she deserves. Jamie truly shows her mettle in this story as well as her ability to both take it and dish it out. As always, she does what's right in the big picture no matter what. Both Marc and Barrett have their places in this story, and Jamie has to choose where her heart belongs even while in the midst of brutal murders and missing people. This book had even more action/danger/suspense than usual, and the chemistry factor was also kicked up a notch. I loved it, and I need more Jamie asap!"}, {"userName": "Diane Saul", "userReviewDate": "May 08, 2018", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/8645650-diane-saul", "userReview": "Jamie is helping SA Marc Sandoval find Elana, the Mother of his son. A son Jamie didn\u2019t know he had. Elana has left her son with Marc and then failed to pick him up, disappearing without a Trace. Marc has a history with Elena which makes him not trust her, but he wants to find her for his sons sake. This is part of a series but could stand on its own. Jamie is helping Marc even tho she knows it won\u2019t make her boyfriend Lt Col Adam Barrett a happy camper. I liked the mystery in the book, it kept me guessing. I am not as wild about Jamie waffling about her romantic life., it made her seem weak to me. Also Marc\u2019s nickname for her, Babe, was a bit much. Adams presence at the end of the book didn\u2019t feel like it was necessary other than to promote the rivalry between the two men. I give this a 4* based on the mystery."}, {"userName": "Susan Beamon", "userReviewDate": "Mar 18, 2018", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/3271638-susan-beamon", "userReview": "I would classify this book as an action/adventure story. There is plenty of action and lots of adventure, some romance but no more than in a cozy mystery, and plenty of peril for some. There are children at risk, gangsters of the darkest souls, U S Marshalls, other federal agents, a private investigator and many normal civilians. Our action starts Colorado, moves to North Dakota and ends in Texas. Things happened quickly but not at an unbelievable breakneck pace. The ending wrapped things up. At no time did I have to suspend belief to keep reading.I enjoyed the story. The writing was smooth and easy to comprehend. I'm not sure where I got this book, which is only an e-book and part of a series, for this review."}, {"userName": "Christen", "userReviewDate": "Feb 12, 2018", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/370430-christen", "userReview": "I have liked every one of these books more and more. In this book, we go on a roller coaster, high speed chase with Jamie and Marc Sandoval. Jamie spends a bit too much time beating herself up over past misdeeds. I found it interesting and appealing that she found herself questioning whether certain things she had to do were actually right to do. I understand the next book is already in the works, and I ask excited to see what will happen with Jamie, Marc and Barrett. If you enjoy action adventure books with a touch of romance, read the series from the beginning. It was more romancy in earlier books, and this one in the series is a great balance."}, {"userName": "Brenda", "userReviewDate": "Feb 25, 2018", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/24458476-brenda", "userReview": "Best yet! I had to buy it the minute I knew this book existed!When DEA agent Marc Sandoval has a personal emergency it is Jamie Sinclair he turns to. Marc's in love with Jamie, but Jamie's not sure where she stands with Lt. Col. Adam Barrett. Accepting Marc as a client is an emotional conflict which Jamie has to fight in order to stay focused on keeping Cody Sandoval safe from the evil that is Max Ribisi. High tension investigation across multiple states and violent encounters where Jamie risks her life kept me reading until the book was done.This ended on a happy note.

The story kept me up until 2am as I Had to know how it was going to end. While Jaime operates as a security specialist out of DC, this book involves a chase across several States as she and her client (and uber-hot friend, Marc Sandoval) attempt to stay one step ahead of a murderer. This is not a book for the faint of heart, and I did become a bit overwhelmed with the body count.

Jamie Sinclair is one tough woman but she's also got a big heart. Sometimes too big. This time around, she's working to find the ex of their friend Marc Sandoval, who has gone missing. Yes, there's a love angle going on but there's also a good thriller. Some it is a tad implausible (and inappropriate for serving officers) but you gotta root for them to find Elena.
