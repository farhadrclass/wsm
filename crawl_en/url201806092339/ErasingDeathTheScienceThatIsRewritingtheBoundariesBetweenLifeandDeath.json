There's two compelling chapters, one describing the history and field of resuscitation science (from the discovery of CPR to current best practices), and another describing the cellular chemistry involved in cellular decay.

I highly recommend it.This doc is an expert in resuscitating people whose hearts have stopped. These days they can use advance techniques involving, but not limited to, chilling the patient, and revive people even hours after they are as dead as a doornail. No breathing, no heartbeat, nothing happening measurable in the brain. You know the results of CPR are pretty terrible, most folks end up dying within a few days anyway, or having brain damage. The science and the technology now exist to greatly improve outcomes.There are three main thrusts to this book. The first is the author's campaign to get skilled personnel and devices in place in every ER to do so.The second is that we should really take seriously what people report they experienced during the time they were dead. Some remember nothing, but a significant percent have so-called Near Death Experiences, which the author would like to rename Actual Death Experiences. He is actually part of a large scientific study of that phenomena. It's fascinating, read it.The third point is... what is consciousness exactly, from a scientific POV? He reviews the research and current hypotheses, about where thoughts come from, and so on. If someone's brain completely stops functioning during the time they are dead, then resumes functioning and they return as the same personality, where did that consciousness abide during the time the brain was dead? What is it? Where is it?A fascinating read for people, like me, who are into biological science, consciousness, and the afterlife."}, {"userName": "Mike", "userReviewDate": "Aug 23, 2013", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/761281-mike", "userReview": "Can science shed some light on metaphysical questions about the nature of the soul? Maybe, but this book sure doesn't. The best spin I can put on it is the author sincerely wants to believe that consciousness continues after death and he will make whatever logical leaps are necessary to prove this to himself.There is some interesting history on resuscitation, but the bulk of the book is mostly boring accounts of near death experiences with the author's unconvincing glosses. Only 1-2% of people revived from death report \"near death experiences\"? No problem, let's assume the other 98% had them & just forgot the experience. And so on.The author's central theses are that in death the brain \"almost instantly\" stops functioning (he uses that phrase repeatedly) and that near death experiences (\"Actual death experiences\" in his idiosyncratic terms) demonstrate that consciousness is not wholly dependent on brain function. But just in the last week or so a widely-reported study seems to have disconfirmed his first thesis (http://www.uofmhealth.org/news/archiv...). Indeed this book is really the first time I've heard it argued that brain function stops immediately when the heart stops -- I'd always read that the shut-down was gradual, if fairly fast. Supposing we grant him the first the thesis, though, the second thesis is not really supported by his arguments unless you buy into a very simplistic model of consciousness that assumes we are never fooled about time and chronology in our experiences -- an assumption that that has been disconfirmed in many, many studies by cognitive scientists and neurologists. All in all it seems like the author, who is no doubt a very capable doctor, is going outside his area of real expertise. The first few chapters cover some interesting developments in resuscitation but the real thrust of the book is that \"there might be an after life because hey, near death experiences.\""}, {"userName": "Melissa", "userReviewDate": "Jun 26, 2017", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/14072411-melissa", "userReview": "DNFI thought this book was just a book about death and resuscitation from a medical viewpoint.

When the brain stops working? When the body has reached the point of no return and a person can't return to their normal self? Dr. Parnia explores this throughout most of this book. Some arguments are stronger than others; some ideas are more consistent than others. As other reviewers have noted, the book does have a few interesting bits, but they may have been better placed in radio interviews (which he's done) or shorter medical papers (which he's written). This book does an important thing, though. Despite its flaws, its call to action for the medical/hospital community to create more systems and structures to revive people after cardiac arrest is a good one. Cooling the body down to slow the decay process while you figure out what's wrong and how to fix it -- great idea! But the rest of the book was pretty uneven. Near-death experiences are always interesting to me, but the supposed \"proof\" that NDEs aren't related to brain activity because, allegedly, brain function ceases 10 seconds after your heart stops is, well, unfounded. The brain isn't on or off. Like the process of death that Dr. Parnia tries to explain (and he does a great job creating the paradigm shift that death needs a different definition and is a process not not necessarily an event), the process of brain damage is also just that -- a process. Not all of your cells die at once and, presumably, not all activity between the neurons ceases immediately. There's much science doesn't know yet.I experienced an NDE with my grandfather in the moments he was dying (whether it was a dream based on my mental obsession over his death or a spiritual response to my prayers that I could help him through the terrifying-for-him journey is something I don't know or necessarily expect to or care to ever know; thank you, William James (see also Varieties of Religious Experience on the practicality of belief)), so it's not that I don't believe there can't be something metaphysical about the thing. But the way Parnia talks about the process of death, it makes sense to me that the brain may, indeed, be involved in a person's near-death experience."}, {"userName": "Andy Hickmott", "userReviewDate": "Aug 10, 2013", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/22571361-andy-hickmott", "userReview": "Where was the editor when this bilge was making its way to market? This bloated book contains maybe a handful of facts, padded out with needless (unless its target market is wholly senile) repetition and anecdotes that blur into a featureless jumble of words. A decent editor would have whittled this down to one third of its size. Of course that would have left it barely a pamphlet.The repetition and redundancy (oh no, am I doing it now?) is on every level. I chose a page at random for this example. A paragraph begins '...in today's modern society...', and goes on '...in the time of Plato and Aristotle in ancient Greece'. I presume 'modern' does not refer to the artistic movement. The time of Plato and Aristotle would seem to pinpoint ancient Greece fairly well (unless Parnia was anxious to specify the location too). Let's go back to the start of the paragraph: 'Although in today's modern society the term soul has taken on a relatively imprecise and mostly religious connotation...'. The point is restated repeatedly over the next few pages. Each paragraph seems to labour its point to death, each chapter to cover ground already picked barren.But most woeful of all is the shortsightedness of Parnia's conclusions. People who have near-death experiences have memories that seem to relate to the time they were flatlined, and he seems willing to believe these 'experiences' really happened and to go off in search of explanations. Yet he never considers the one glaring common factor - all of his subjects suffered a massive neurological trauma: their brains got shut down and then rebooted. That's going to cause some mess in the greyware!"}, {"userName": "Jen", "userReviewDate": "Sep 06, 2013", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/3275432-jen", "userReview": "The title grabbed my attention at the library immediately. Parnia, a doctor, explains death as a process rather than an event. The clinical definition of death is the moment our hearts stop beating, but that is not the same thing as truly being \"gone\". All of our body's cells must also die before we are irreversibly dead. When our heart stops, it wreaks havoc on our bodies; we must be revived through careful technique if we are to be revived successfully and stay alive. However, there is no government agency or commission demanding medical revival be done in standard protocols on empirical evidence. This is like the aviation industry having no FAA available to oversee and demand safety protocol. Promising as a popular work on cardiac resuscitation, but ultimately I feel like the editor wasn't doing his or her job with this one. Redundant, redundant...did I mention redundant? It had a few bright spots, but overall it was boring. It probably could have been a good 50-100 pages shorter.

Part physicians guide to the physiology of death and resuscitation science, part mystical exploration of near death experiences and part consideration of the existence of self/soul independent of the brain, it isn't entirely clear what the author wants this book to be. There are times when the Parnia's ponderous writing (page long paragraphs, run-on sentences, etc.) and his discussions of strange efforts to scientifically study near death experiences, make the book downright uncomfortable to read. On the other hand, there is deep insight here on the tremendous advances in \"resuscitation science\" - the emergency medical procedures taken to preserve brain function and restart the heart during cardiac arrest. The author is at his best when reviewing the physiology of death and the relatively recent understanding that even after the heart stops and brain activity ceases, \"brain cells, liver cells, and muscle cells all have a period of time after the heart stops and a person dies before they become irreversibly damaged.\" The period before irreversible damage, the author notes, is much longer than originally thought and therefore the long held belief that there is no way back from a cessation of respiration and brain activity is simply not true - that for some period of time, death is fully reversible. Underlying this reality is the truth that \"contrary to common understanding, death is not a moment, it's a process - a process that can be interrupted well after it has begun.\"Parnia is quick to point out that if there is an chronic, unresolved medical issue that has caused the heart to stop, resuscitating an individual is fruitless without a resolution to the underlying problem. Yet, for many who have suffered heart failure due to accident or injury who are otherwise healthy, resuscitation (even after long periods) can occur without permanent brain damage if managed with the right medical protocols. The book is at its most compelling when it sticks to science and health policy. For example, the commentary about global systems failure when it comes to emergency cardiac care - in particular the lack of universal acceptance of cooling body temperature as an essential element to prolonging life - is a powerful criticism of our global health care systems and their standards. The evidence that the simple act of cooling the body of someone who has experienced cardiac arrest could literally save thousands of lives across the globe is startling and disconcerting. With one exception, the book goes off course when it delves into mystical explorations of \"near death experiences\" and philosophical debate about the existence of an independent self (or soul) beyond the brain. The author's strong suit is not philosophy and the book can veer from rigorously scientific and lucid to downright mystical and bizarre. The one \"aha\" moment for me in the independent soul debate came when Parnia pointed out the scientific conundrum related to how a biological structures like brain cells could create human consciousness. \"In science, we have not been able to come up with a plausible biological mechanism to account for how a cell or groups of cells working together (i.e. the brain) could possibly generate a thought or collection of thoughts and hence ultimately the entity we call human consciousness. We know how cells make electricity through the movement of chemical molecules, but we just don't know how they could also make thoughts from electricity or chemicals.\"Here then, is the miracle of human thought. How do we go from electricity and chemical interactions to human consciousness? At times rigorous and scientific at others uncomfortably mystical and even odd, this book is a conundrum. I found it worth the effort for the physiology, not the philosophy."}, {"userName": "Rajiv Hazaray", "userReviewDate": "Mar 17, 2018", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/55876130-rajiv-hazaray", "userReview": "- it\u2019s by far the most scientific book written on death and post-death state of mind that I have come across. - good depth in explaining the \u201cprocess\u201d of death (as against the \u201cevent\u201d of death but a lot of repetition - not sure if author intended the repetition to emphasis important concepts- Author was lead researcher of first scientific study of out of body experience after death.

There are two complementary areas of study he talks about in this book. The first half of the book deals with improvements in resuscitation techniques and the sorry fact that the best procedures are not practiced evenly, so that whether a patient survives very much depends on where he is receiving care. Even different areas of the same hospital may have different levels of care. Also, the decision about how long to attempt resuscitation is very subjective, so that many doctors may give up after about twenty minutes, an amount of time once connected with the prospect of irreversible brain damage. Dr. Parnia explains that it is now known that cooling the body slows brain cell death, prolonging the safe period in which to attempt resuscitation. He opens the book with the story of Joe Tralosi, who, in 2009, was dead for about forty-five minutes, then again for a further fifteen minutes when his restarted heart stopped again. Because Mr. Tralosi received the most modern standards of care, with his body having been cooled, he suffered no brain damage. Dr. Parnia also tells of machines used in Asia, but not as commonly in the West, that cycle the blood out of the patient's body to oxygenate it, then back through the body, acting as a surrogate heart, while the doctors , who have bought a little more time with this approach, try to figure out the underlying cause for the heart having stopped.Dr. Parnia emphasizes that the heart can be restarted in bodies that are otherwise viable. If a body has other issues, as being riddled with cancer for example, the heart will just continue to stop.The second part of his book is about the after-death experiences he has collected as his second area of study. In the 70s, a book by Raymond Moody, titled \"Life After Life\" made popular accounts of NDEs , or \"near death experiences\". Dr. Parnia dislikes that term since the people he has studied are not just near death; they are dead (as ascertained by the heart having stopped, breathing having stopped, and brain function having stopped as evidenced by fixed dilated pupils). Some of these stories are truly fascinating. I got chills reading about a three-year-old boy who needed to have heart surgery. During the surgery, he effectively died and was brought back. He remembered a nice lady who stayed with him as he floated above the doctors working on his body. A year or so later, he and his mother saw such a surgery on TV and he said the machine present at this surgery was like the one used in his own. His mother told him he couldn't have known that since he was asleep during that time. Soon after that, he was shown a picture of his grandmother, who had died before he was born. He immediately recognized her as the nice woman who had stayed with him as he floated above his body during surgery.I should hasten to say that, although there are some riveting stories in this book, much of it is very dry. The author wants to present the information in a rigorous, scientific way and backs up all of his accounts with research. So, this is not the easy read of the bestseller \"Proof of Heaven\" ((by Eben Alexander). I think it held more credence for me because of that. There is nothing sensationalistic here; this is a measured account linked to ongoing research. The author has a very extensive bibliography for further reading at the end of the book.I became interested in this book as a result of hearing the author on the radio:http://www.npr.org/2013/02/21/1724956..."}, {"userName": "Philip", "userReviewDate": "Apr 16, 2013", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/11214797-philip", "userReview": "Life after death? Well, apparently there is resuscitation after \"clinical death\". Sam Parnia is a doctor who specializes in emergency room resuscitation after cardiac arrest. We all ultimately die of cardiac arrest: the heart stops beating, the lungs stop mixing oxygen and blood, and brain activity ceases due to the lack of oxygen. But in some cases resuscitation has brought the \"clinically dead\" back to life. This book falls into three parts: 1. The technology and treatment of resuscitation, which the author feels, is poorly understood and developed. 2. The rare claim of some of those resuscitated that they've experienced some kind of event after they've died clinically, including the so-called \"out-of-body\" experience. And, 3. The whole notion of consciousness. Raymond Moody wrote THE book on near death experience \"Life After Life\" in 1975. He coined the phrase. Moody went on to claim that people had lived previous life times. This didn't improve his credibility. Since then the subject has fallen out of favor for lack of more credible evidence and a willingness to test this idea \"scientifically\".Dr. Sam Parnia makes a good case for understanding the \"dying\" process and developing standardized procedures to be used in resuscitation, such as super-cooling the patient. He also has attempted to design an experiment to identify those who have undergone \"out of body\" experiences during their clinical \"death\". The problem is that full resuscitation is rare. Few of those cardiac arrests are reversed without brain damage and maybe only 10% of those who do survive undamaged claim any kind of \"near death\" experience. So, the evidence is pretty thin but Parnia believes that it's strange that it happens at all. So, why does it happen at all? Parnia thinks that consciousness may be some kind of immaterial state of being (not a brain state at all) that actually continues after \"death\". He's still working on creating experiments to test this fascinating notion."}, {"userName": "Geoff Glenister", "userReviewDate": "Mar 22, 2015", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/38289415-geoff-glenister", "userReview": "I like this book because Dr. Parnia doesn't spend a lot of time speculating. He spends a lot of time talking about how the specialty area of resuscitation has pushed the boundary of death back. Whereas before, death, seen as the point of no return, was placed at the point where the heart stopped, there was no breathing, and the pupils did not dilate (a sign that the brain is not currently functioning), now, specialists can pump chilled saline into such a body and resuscitate it hours later and there have been full recoveries afterwards. He spends a chapter even going over how there have been patients who were medially defined as being brain dead who - years later, after being administered drugs like dopamine and Ambien - woke up and were lucid while these drugs were in their system, even though modern medical knowledge had said that certain areas of their brains were damaged to the point where consciousness was not possible. He spends a short time talking about Near Death Experiences (NDE's), which he emphasizes should really be called \"After Death Experiences\". What I liked about how he treats the subject is that he doesn't speculate - he does point out that none of the explanations that have been offered really fit. For example, one explanation has been that because the body has more carbon dioxide than usual (this would be found almost universally among resuscitated patients, as the process of forcing air into the body would cause this), this causes hallucinations. He points out, however, that a typical hallucination from this case would not be well-structured - it would be incoherent. However, the experiences that have been reported by patients who reported NDE's (or ADE's, rather) have been well-structured and coherent. This, among other things, ought to cause us to rethink our assumptions about what consciousness is, according to the author."}, {"userName": "Deni Jane", "userReviewDate": "Dec 04, 2015", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/44616913-deni-jane", "userReview": "A very good book for those who are interested in the clinical details around cardiac arrest. Not so good for those who have found out about it from spiritual forums. This book is not spiritual, it's medical. It tells in much details what the body goes trough during cardiac arrest and the very process of death. The reversible part and the irreversible part. The most interesting part of this was the sad fact that life does have a price tag. That the survival rate from cardiac arrest varies not only between countries, but even among cities and hospitals in the same country. That there are not common recommendations and practices adopted by the WHO with respect to cardiac arrest and resuscitation base on latest science and technology. Very very sad! But on the bright side, there are many interesting stories of patients who survived cardiac arrest, who had near-death experience or who awoke from coma. I really enjoyed those stories and I think there should have been more of those in the book. Also more historical references. Somehow we don't know enough of the practices people used to have before 20th century, some of which very dubiously ethical but kind of efficient.A very important part of the message of the book is about the criteria of clinial death. A very touchy subject, also, because it means death for the donor and life for the recipients of the organs and vice versa. A very unclear scientifically unclear topic also. Something which people and doctors don't discuss but in fact, it desperately needs more research and more regulations.

Thankfully, the author did not go down that rabbit hole and kept the discussion within the realm of scientific investigation and his involvement in the AWARE study. The downside of this was that there was nothing truly new to report on the subject, just a rehash of long debated ideas. As such, I felt it's inclusion in the book didn't really add anything.So, in the end I am unable to give this book more than 3 stars. It's worth a read to learn about the latest science in resuscitation, it left me discovering nothing new in the arena of NDEs, consciousness, and the soul."}, {"userName": "Al", "userReviewDate": "Mar 28, 2013", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/892265-al", "userReview": "We have a friend that nearly died before receiving a liver transplant a few years ago. She asked me if I had read this book, and I told her that I had not even heard of it. She said that I really had to get a copy. When people tell me this, I go straight to the Internet to check it out. It sounded very interesting, so I went down to the bookstore and bought it.Dr. Parnia explains that with the latest technology and practices, they have really increased their ability to resuscitate people from cardiac arrest. They are doing this over longer periods of time, and with much less or even with no permanent cell damage to the persons organs and tissues. The future on this front seems to be on the verge of a revolution. Additionally, we are also experiencing a great increase in the number of people that are coming back from Near Death Experiences ( or as he likes to say; After Death Experiences)telling incredibly detailed stories from the time that they were flat lined. He is involved in a quest to determine if these claims can be verified empirically. He is also on a quest to advance our understanding regarding the chemistry of dying cells, and just what can be done to prolong the time frame for cell viability. This book compels the reader to wonder, \"Just what is the reality when we die, and what can be done to hold it off?\" He touches on the idea that the \"Self\" could possibly consist of energy or matter that is currently beyond our ability to detect. These are exciting ideas, and you really have to get a copy of this book."}, {"userName": "CF", "userReviewDate": "Jul 03, 2014", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/2686359-cf", "userReview": "People's realities are determined and defined by what they know, and this reality has conventional boundaries. Often we have been conditioned to define reality as that which we can see, touch, and perceive with our five senses. A scientifically-based study on the true existence of Near-Death Experiences lies at the heart of this book. Outlining the difference between initial death, brain death, heart attacks and cardiac arrests, this book aims to explain and indeed change the exact concept of when true death happens. Does it happen when the heart stops? Or when there is truly no brain activity to be found? Or, even more exploratory, when the brain has started to deteriorate? Considering the choppy and inconsistent times at which a person actually 'dies', can these methods still be seen as reliable? Dr Sam Parnia's resuscitation methods and extending times where a person can be literally 'brought back from the dead' are questioning the current ways of treating cardiac arrest, and, along with research from all over the world, are revolutionising science. A really interesting book that perhaps creates more questions than it answers, but, nonetheless, the future of medicine and resuscitation is one that definitely needs to be researched and funded more across the board.

But today, we have developed a medical science of maintaining someone who may be clinically dead (cardiac arrest and no brain activity) which sometimes results in a complete recovery \u2014 even after the patient has been clinically dead for hours. Erasing Death by Sam Parnia chronicles this remarkable advance in medicine, which has allowed death to be held at bay. Sometimes, it even evokes the age old question: do we have a soul?The process of saving someone who is clinically dead requires the combined skills of many disciplines. Sam Parnia tells us that from the ambulance medics, to the ER physicians, to the ICU staff, every step necessary to insure recovery must be choreographed perfectly. Unfortunately, there is no national or international set of standards regarding exactly how to treat someone who is clinically dead. It is not mandatory for all ambulances and ER rooms to have body cooling technology or mechanical CPR/Ventilators (two of the most important things needed).[Continued]Full SevenPonds Review:http://blog.sevenponds.com/lending-in..."}, {"userName": "Stella Dunn", "userReviewDate": "Apr 25, 2013", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/10330392-stella-dunn", "userReview": "The findings in this book will lead to an upgraded understanding of who and what a human is. Below the most interesting quots by the author:'When you die, there\u2019s no blood flow going into your brain. If it goes below a certain level, you can\u2019t have electrical activity. It takes a lot of imagination to think there\u2019s somehow a hidden area of your brain that comes into action when everything else isn\u2019t working.These observations raise a question about our current concept of how brain and mind interact. The historical idea is that electrochemical processes in the brain lead to consciousness. That may no longer be correct, because we can demonstrate that those processes don\u2019t go on after death.There may be something in the brain we haven\u2019t discovered that accounts for consciousness, or it may be that consciousness is a separate entity from the brain'.........'Just because something is inexplicable with our current science doesn\u2019t make it superstitious or wrong.
