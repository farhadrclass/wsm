Our current National Ambassador of Young People\u2019s Literature, Gene Luen Yang, put this far more eloquently when he urged people to partake in the Reading Without Walls Challenge. The rules are simple. You can read about a character that doesn\u2019t look like your, a topic you don\u2019t know much about, and/or a format you don\u2019t usually pick up. I often wonder what would have happened if I\u2019d encountered this challenge as a child. When I was a 9-12 year old I went out of my way to avoid works of realistic fiction that could potentially depress me. But having finished the latest Jason Reynolds title in the Track series called Patina, if I could go back in time and hand my younger self one book that fell squarely outside her comfort zone, I\u2019d probably hand her this. A companion novel to Ghost, Reynolds\u2019s latest takes a long hard look at what it sometimes takes to trust the people around you. Even when they\u2019ve given you absolutely no reason to do so.Patina has lost a race. Patina is not a good loser. Not good at all. If you knew Patina, this would probably be the first thing you knew about her. The thing is, Patina\u2019s already lost a lot of things in her life. Her dad died when she was pretty young, and her mom nearly died of diabetes after that. She lives with her aunt and uncle, helps take care of her younger sister, and attends this hoity toity school that may be good for her future but is death on her friendships. At least there\u2019s track, though, right? Only now Patina has lost a race and, stranger still, she and her fellow runners are going to be forming relay teams. Now the trick to any team is to synchronize yourself with the people around you. Patina, however, can\u2019t afford to synchronize with anyone in her life. She\u2019s a loner (isn\u2019t she?). Someone who doesn\u2019t need help (are you sure?). And she\u2019s not easily surprised. Not easily, but when it happens then maybe a lot of other things in her life will start to change as well.Before we go any further today I would like us to consider the case of The Mighty Miss Malone. Author Christopher Paul Curtis was at the top of his game. Sure he\u2019d had the occasional misfire here and there (his YA never really hit the heights and his Mr. Chickee series wasn\u2019t quite up to his usual standards) but when it came to historical fiction nobody could match him. Bud Not Buddy? The Watsons Go to Birmingham? Elijah of Buxton? The dude was on fire! Of course, there was one thing that ALL his books had in common. They all starred boys. This is, of course, a good thing. Curtis knows boys. Also, do you know how many middle grade novels for 9-12 year olds star African-American boys in a given year? You can usually count the number on your own two hands. So we needed those boys on our shelves. But as he is an artist, Mr. Curtis felt compared to push himself into new territory. So in 2012 he produced the book The Mighty Miss Malone. The hope was to fully flesh out a minor character from Bud Not Buddy. The result was disappointing. Deza, the heroine, is never allowed to save the day. Instead she\u2019s a fairly passive character who watches as her troublemaking younger brother single-handedly rescues the family from despair. So it was with great trepidation that I picked up Patina. The similarities were already in place. Like Curtis, Mr. Reynolds is an award-winning African-American author who had done us the great good of providing us with a plethora of memorable, wonderful black boy characters. And like Mr. Curtis, Jason decided to write a book from a girl\u2019s perspective. So the question I hand to you today is this: Did it work?Let\u2019s talk a little bit about why Mr. Reynolds wrote Patina in the first place. When Jason was initially approached by a publisher to write a sports book, he was offered \"street ball\". A different publisher offered him a series deal where he could pick the sport himself. Sold! So right from the start it was clear that there were four kids in these books that would go on personal journeys. Ghost kicks it off, and Patina makes it clear that Reynolds isn\u2019t afraid to dive into his first female heroine right from the start. Along the way he makes some very specific choices. For example, while there are men and boys in the book, the bulk of the focus, as well as the characters themselves, is on girls. Patina is surrounding by a strong support network of women. She has a birth mother and an adopted mom. She has female track friends, female school friends (by the end), old female friends with whom she keeps in touch, and a sister. At the same time, her life isn\u2019t what you\u2019d necessarily call easy. Patina has to keep an eye on her younger sister, deal with her fancy school, and try not to worry too much about her mom. The author once said about this book (and here I'm paraphrasing), \u201cPatina is about someone who deserves to be a little girl and can\u2019t be.\u201d He\u2019s purposefully working to make Patina the hero of her own book, and happily there are moments in the story where she takes steps to be proactive and solve her own problems. There was one aspect of the book that bothered me though, and you might well write it off entirely. Now as a character Patina has a dead daddy, a mom with diabetes, and loving stepparents. But as a children\u2019s librarian I\u2019m very used to these overused, very regular, very predictable middle grade tropes. So when I see a female character with a tricky home life going to a posh private school, I\u2019m going to expect one thing: bullying. Reynolds has all the right pieces in place, but he doesn\u2019t go in that direction. It made me pause and think. Bullying in children\u2019s books is all about the mustache twirling (so to speak). But there are different levels in reality. In this book there is a kind of unspoken assumption that Patina is going to shoulder the bulk of the group project she's assigned. Sometimes the merest of assumptions are the most effective methods of keeping people under your control.Which is all well and good but it doesn\u2019t lead to a whole lot of conflict for Patina. In Ghost we had a boy trying to outrun his own demons (and failing). Patina, in contrast, isn\u2019t running away from anything specifically. Cleverly, Reynolds changes the focus slightly so that her challenge is working well with others. When you\u2019ve been micromanaging your life, you may have a hard time relinquishing power (or what you interpret to be power) to others around you. The struggle to trust is inherently less exciting than the struggle to maintain control over the self. As a result, Patina\u201d is significantly less exciting than Ghost. In Ghost you had shoplifting, past trauma, bullies at school, fights, and showboating. In Patina there\u2019s a car crash, but very little in the way of interpersonal problems. Patina is told from the start of the book to get a handle on her anger. Which she does. You might expect there\u2019d be a scene where she goes off on someone, and there is one on the track. That moment is then resolved neatly and almost immediately with no long-term repercussions. Heck, her family is 100% supportive of her track running. Even the early chapter book  Izzy Barr, Running Star by Claudia Mills made it so that Izzy has to compete for parental interest and attention. So Reynolds is very big on the learning and growing with this book. Not so much the immediate conflicts before that.Not that it isn\u2019t still a great book. You know that palpable sense of relief you feel as an adult when you\u2019re reading through a title for kids and you come to a part where you realize the book is packed full of amazing writing? I got that here. Owing to its aversion to conflict Patina probably couldn\u2019t be called Mr. Reynolds\u2019s strongest work to date, but at the same time it\u2019s enormously satisfying to read an author that works hard to give a female character a voice, impetus, smarts, and insecurities. In other words, he makes her a real person. A great book for kids that are into realistic fiction, as well as those kids that are willing to trek out of their comfort zones a little to look at a truly great read.

So it skewed younger than I was expecting. I'm not sure how to summarize this story. It doesn't really have a plot, as it covers a week or so in the life of Patina Jones, from one track meet to the next. Her life is pretty complicated, as she and her little sister live with their adoptive parents who are also their aunt and uncle. The girls' father died in his sleep, and their mother has severe Type II diabetes which resulted in the loss of her legs, plus she's on kidney dialysis and tired all the time, hence the adoption situation. Patty attends a mostly-white charter school near her aunt and uncle's house, but runs track for a club in her old neighborhood. I enjoyed this book, so don't think my 3-star rating is lukewarm. Patty goes through quite a bit in the period of the story, grows up a little, and gains some insights into other people around her, all in a definitely not-preachy way. I thought the track aspect of the story was really well done, woven through every other thread in the book because that's how sports work in a person's life. Whatever else is going on, you go to practice, and you put it all aside and just concentrate on doing what your coach tells you. But while you're doing everything else, you're also focused on the next practice, the next meet, the next goal. It's all intertwined. I plan to read the first book in this series, and then my understanding is that there will be two more. Each book focuses on a different member of the same track club, so they're only tangentially related, not direct sequels. Patina had a great voice and really clever and funny observations of the world around her, so I'm looking forward to getting more of the same from the other books in this series."}, {"userName": "Book Riot Community", "userReviewDate": "Aug 30, 2017", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/33447134-book-riot-community", "userReview": "The follow-up to the wonderful National Book Award finalist Ghost.

While I'd heard a great deal about wunderkind Reynolds and read with respect some of his YA work, that he had a middle grade book coming out was a complete surprise to me. About track --- my one competitive sport --- no less. And so I jumped right in and fell madly in love with it. (You can read my gushy review here.) And so now here we are a year later with the next in the Track series, featuring team mate Patty aka Patina.On the very first page of\u00a0\nPatina\u00a0\nwe are brought back to the track meet that ended Ghost,\u00a0Patty telling us what happened and why. No spoilers from me though! Just moving on as this story is Patty's not Ghost's. It is one of legs, strong ones, missing ones, relay race ones, and more. These real and metaphoric legs make their way through the novel, effectively raising and highlighting important themes. They serve beautifully as Patty watches, acts, considers, and grows in her understanding of the world.Where Ghost was about racing for and against yourself, Patina is about teamwork. There is teamwork practice of all kinds for the track team members who will be running relays in an upcoming meet. As well there is the group assignment at school where Patty is resigned to doing the bulk of the work, as usual, sensing no action on at least two of the group members. There is the teamwork of her family -- her little sister, her diabetic and legless mother, and the aunt and uncle the siblings live with. The adults around them are good and caring, supporting the girls in the best ways they can. Reynolds' scenes are beautifully done full of sensory details. You can just see those family meals, smell the uncle's nasty truck, hear authentic conversations, and feel Patty's body as she pushes it as hard as she can in workouts. The relationship between the sisters, Patty and Maddy is especially warm and delightful.What for me elevates this book and its predecessor to such a high level (goodreads five stars:) is Reynolds' fabulous writing. He's got a way with a few sentences that stops me in total admiration, again and again. Say these:Deep breaths, Patty, my mad slowly mellowing. This temper ain't a new temper. Breaking invisible teacups. Smashing them everywhere. No this ain't new. I just be keeping it pushed down, all the way down in my legs.I highly, highly recommend this book and eagerly await the next in the series."}, {"userName": "Beth", "userReviewDate": "Oct 07, 2017", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/4063913-beth", "userReview": "Patina for a Newbery sticker this January! This is pretty close to perfect - it's got wonderful family interactions, different interesting friend groups, a protagonist who is struggling in day-to-day recognizable ways. One thing I love about this is the lack of a central conflict. Instead, Patty deals with everyday life and the inherent conflict being around other people brings. She reaches out. She compartmentalizes. She's ambitious and hardworking and open to new ideas.Reynolds is so assured and confident and competent as a writer. This reads like a book that could have been famous for the past three decades - or will be famous for the next three decades - because it is so classic and will keep being read. I don't know that I can list any praise higher than \"pretty close to perfect,\" so I'll stop now; my one quibble is that I don't want the ending to become a gimmick! It was spectacular at the end of Ghost, slightly less so here. It fits Patty's story fairly well, and the intent - that the outcome isn't what matters! - can apply, too. But it isn't as surprising and clever when it's repeated, and I want the ending to match how smart and warm and full of heart this book is."}, {"userName": "Shelly", "userReviewDate": "Jul 29, 2017", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/17095445-shelly", "userReview": "Just as brilliant as the first in this series!"}, {"userName": "Brandy Painter", "userReviewDate": "Jan 14, 2018", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/2840210-brandy-painter", "userReview": "4.5 starsOriginally posted here at Random Musings of a Bibliophile.I enjoyed Ghost, the first book in Jason Reynolds' series about the new kids on an elite track team. It was excellent just as everything published so far by Reynolds has been. In 2017 I made his YA book my priority because I do tend to love his YA works slightly more. As a result, reading Patina got pushed into the start of 2018. I hate that I waited, but also I'm happy to start of a new year of reading on such a high note. This book is fabulous.Patty is always running even off the truck. She runs from one thing to another as she tries to do all and be all to the people around her. She has to help take care of her sister because she always has, even though now they live with their aunt and uncle who are wonderful. She has to help take care of mom, because her mom lost both of her legs to diabetes. She has a group project at school and is doing all the work because someone has to. She has to win at her track meets because she ain't no junk, and that's what she's supposed to do. Win. Over a week when life blows up for her more ways than one, Patty learns a lot about community, relying on other people, and exactly what's most important.One thing Jason Reynolds always excels at is voice. This is, I believe, the first time he's tackled a female narrator though. He got it right here too. One thing I'm appreciating about this series now there are two books out is also how much Reynolds is getting the middle school voice. Ghost was exactly the right combination of impulsive, aggressive, and skeptical. Patty is the right combination of attitude, superiority, and cynicism. Both are exactly as self-centered as middle schoolers often are in that they often don't see past their own noses. Everything is about them. These kids embody all the reasons people say they don't enjoy hanging out with or teaching middle schoolers. (And all the reasons I LOVE to do both of those.) The thing about middle schoolers is, with the right sort of guidance, that's when they start learning how to be not only themselves but part of a wider community too. Patty is struggling with a lot. Though she is loved (and knows it) and well cared for, her father is dead and her mother is gravely ill. Her aunt and uncle are wonderful, but this girl has experienced trauma and it shows. She has started a new fancy school where she is a black girl surrounded by white people-people have far more wealth than the people in her previous school. She is trying to figure out how and where to fit into that. She is one of the new kids on the Defenders and has just been chosen to race with some of the veterans on the 800 relay. She has put a lot of expectations on herself, and she refuses to accept failure of any kind-even if it isn't really failure and coming in second rather than first in a race.The book begins at the first track meet where Patty comes in second and is none to happy about it. Then follows a week that would wear any person down. I really enjoyed what Reynolds did with the plotting here. This is a character focused work. We follow Patty through an incredibly stressful and intense week. There isn't any one major thing. It's all the vagaries of life we experience from one day to the next with the sudden unexpected punches that seem to come at the worst times. We live Patty's life with her as she learns to appreciate the people around her in new ways through it all at home, at school, and at the track. The way Reynolds pulled it all together and packed every day life full of so much meaning and intensity in so few pages is really quite extraordinary.Can I also say that I really like the way Reynolds is ending these so far? I won't go too much into the whys of that because spoilers. Suffice it to say that I think it's super clever and meaningful in so many ways.This series is a must read for any kids who enjoy realistic stories featuring school, friends, and family. No other series comes close to touching all of these things as well and realistically as this one does. Even better, you don't necessarily have to read them in order. All told there will be four books, each featuring one of the newbies on the track team. The new one up is Sunny.

I really did. But I loved Ghost so much, that you couldn't help but be slightly disappointed by this one. It was great, it just wasn't AS great as Ghost's story. There was very little track or running involved in this one. The story seemed to revolve around Patina's day to day activities in an almost - dare I say it? - tedious manner. She woke up, she had breakfast, she went to school, avoided all the snobby people at school, had to sit through her silly group of girls for the group project on Frida Kahlo, went to get her younger sister, then their aunt picked them up from school, dropped her off to track rehearsals, where she had minimal conversations, then was picked up again by her aunt where they sat through the car ride and had the exact same conversation they have every single day, then they got home where she goes to finish her homework, and asks her sister if she needed help with any assignments, then was called down for dinner, the same dinner they have every single evening, with their aunt running the conversation around the table, then off to bed. Sundays were different. Sundays they go pick up their mom, who had her legs amputated due to the spread of Diabetes, and they go to church. There were also a couple of changes to the routine when she had to go to a girl's house to work on the group project, and another time when she had to go to the hospital. Otherwise, that's basically all there was to it. And that was disappointing. I wanted to see more, read more, find out more. I wanted more interactions with Patina and the track kids. I wanted more Ghost, more Sunny, more Lou. More coach. I finished the book, but didn't feel like I knew Patina well yet. I was hoping I would, but I didn't. So now, I'm sitting here wondering how to review it properly, and I can't. I just found out the next book will be about Sunny, and that's exciting. Sunny is a character we know, and we've seen, so it must be good!

Patina seems nice in Ghost, but I was worried about the drama that seems to inevitably come whenever a girl enters junior high/middle school. However, Patty has sense (thank goodness). Sure, there's some drama. But she tries to avoid it. I went into this book thinking that it was going to be about how she is running away from something (like Ghost) or running for someone. Which I suppose is true. In the race at the end, especially, she is running for her mother, and sister, and her teammates. Yet to me, that isn't why she runs. She looks forward to practice. She \"needed practice . . . needed to run.\" (pg. 164) Not because she needs to prove herself. Not because she is running away from life. She needs to immerse herself in something else. She runs to \"just turn it all off. Leave everything . . . in the dust.\" (pg. 207) And that totally makes sense to me. One other little thing that I love about this book is her relationship with the boys on the track team, especially Ghost, Lu, and Sunny.

Thank you to Atheneum/Simon Kids for providing me with a review copy of this book \u2013 all opinions are my own. I\u2019ll start by saying to please read GHOST first, or encourage the kids/students in your life to read GHOST first. Of course, you CAN read PATINA first, and the story won\u2019t be ruined, but then GHOST will be ruined for you and I 100% guarantee you that after reading PATINA, you\u2019ll want to have read GHOST. So, if you haven\u2019t read it yet, go grab yourself a copy of GHOST, settle in, read it, then come back to PATINA. In GHOST, Reynolds introduced readers to a middle school boy nicknamed Ghost, who ends up joining the Defenders track team. It is an excellent story \u2013 go read the summary and reviews of it \u2013 I gave it 5 stars. It ends with Ghost running a track race\u2026\u2026and seriously just ENDS. You finish the book not knowing how the race ends, and it is excruciating!Patina picks up where Ghost left off, with Ghost\u2019s race. This time, however, Patty (Patina) is narrating the story as another member of the Defenders. I absolutely fell in love with Patina, maybe even more than I fell in love with Ghost. I\u2019m not sure if it\u2019s because as a female protagonist it\u2019s easier to relate, or if Reynolds just wrote her so exquisitely that it was inevitable, but I LOVE this character. You learn quickly that her family life is pretty complicated and she\u2019s struggling a bit to assimilate to a fancier school and living with her aunt and uncle. As she describes being a caretaker for both her sister and her mother (I won\u2019t tell you why \u2013 go read the book!) I could relate to her even as a 30-something adult \u2013 caretaking is a universal issue and it is heartbreaking when kids have to fill that role. Patty is achingly sincere and sweet, but she has a tough side that comes out as a defense in certain situations, sometimes getting her into trouble. As she tries to reconcile her new academy school with her old public school, and describes the neighborhoods in the city she lives in, readers can tell just how aware of class she is. Race too, for that matter. Patty ain\u2019t no junk, as she says, but running may be the only way to prove that. This series is required for middle grade libraries and classrooms \u2013 my students just loved Ghost last year and have been eagerly awaiting Patina\u2019s story. When I took my own kids to see Reynolds speak at a local library last winter, they were SO excited to hear him talk about the continuation of the Defenders team story \u2013 I can\u2019t wait to see who the next Track book is based on! And there had better be a next book since this one ends\u2026\u2026\u2026.just like that."}, {"userName": "Ms. Yingling", "userReviewDate": "Jul 04, 2017", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/2636606-ms-yingling", "userReview": "E ARC from Edelweiss Above the TreelinePatty loves to run, but even more than that, she loves winning races. This is understandable, since there is a lot in her life that hasn't worked out. Her father passed away before her younger sister Maddy was born, and a few years after that, her mother lost her legs to diabetes. The girls are fortunate in that their father's brother and his wife (whom they call Momly) are caring for the girls, but they do get to see their mother once a week when they take her to church. The girls attend a fancy charter school, where Patty doesn't feel she quite fits in. She misses her best friend, Cotton, from her old neighborhood. Patty takes very good care of her sister, but is difficult on the track team and at school. When she is assigned a group project in history, she is not excited to work with the other girls, even though they do pick her topic, Frida Kahlo. Patty's event is the 800, so she's not excited to run a relay, either, especially when one of the other girls in the group upsets her with a comment about Momly. When a car accident injures members of her family, Patty learns that she occasionally has to rely on the help of others, and it makes her appreciate the help she has been getting more. Strengths: Ghost has been wildly popular in my school, so I'm hoping that readers will pick up this second book. The character development really shines in this story, and is very well layered and nuanced-- the whole concept of learning to work in a group is huge, yet rarely discussed in middle grade literature. The details about how Patty and Maddy ended up with their aunt and uncle, as well as their aunt's back story, were realistic and compelling. There is a lot of good track information as well; if I worked with runners doing relays, I'd definitely make them waltz together! The inclusion of the health consequences of diabetes is handled deftly as well. Weaknesses: I really disliked Patty at the beginning of the book, so I was glad to see her character develop. I wish the coaches were nicer and more helpful. And this is personal-- I was VERY confused by Momly serving turkey legs for dinner every night. I can't say that in 30 years of grocery shopping, I've ever even seen a turkey leg in the store! What I really think: This is a title that is growing on me. I do love the covers, and can't wait to read the next one!"}, {"userName": "Tamsyn", "userReviewDate": "Sep 01, 2017", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/392099-tamsyn", "userReview": "Another excellent book in the Track series -- equal to or exceeding the first. I loved having a female main character, and such a strong girl she has had to become! Though she is well-cared-for by her aunt and uncle, she is always taking care of her younger sister, Maddy, and always aware of her wheelchair-bound mother. Health issues, portrayal of a successful mixed race marriage, socioeconomic/cultral challenges with her private school, and, throughout it all, her love of running and being on the track team. Another cliffhanger ending. Jason Reynolds is quite a writer!"}, {"userName": "Gail", "userReviewDate": "Sep 03, 2017", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/1240634-gail", "userReview": "Jason Reynolds continues to be one of my favorite authors."}, {"userName": "Alicia", "userReviewDate": "Aug 24, 2017", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/1806073-alicia", "userReview": "Yes. YES. Yes! Yes. Did I say yes? Jason Reynolds has a hit series and the second one does not disappoint with his strong girl main character. Patina is every girl that he knew growing up who had the weight of the world on her shoulders. Every chapter begins with something (usually too large to handle) TO DO. Patina's mom goes to dialysis several days a week and has lost both of her legs. Unable to care for Patina and her little sister Maddy, their white aunt and her husband, Patina's mom's brother, take over the daily care. It's on Sunday when the girls get dressed up and Momly takes them over to church with their Mom. Momly talks to their mother each day to fill her in on what's going on and then it's rehashed on Sunday. And Bev didn't make no junk. So Patina feels responsible for her little sister, the care of her mom, and everything else. She's on the same elite running team as Ghost and she's now attending Chester Academy, a preppier school closer to Momly and Uncle Tony's house and Patina is starting to fit in better, recognizing her values and how other people are. Reynolds creates so much depth and feeling and I LOVE that it's not about romance! It's about a chick doing her thing. Yes. And more yes. Give me all of this a hundred times over.Love Coach-- \"We all just sort of nodded, numbly. This was going to be hell. 'I don't understand nods and I can't read minds,' Coach growled. 'We got it, Coach,' Mikey said, putting on his game face. \"She would take a bite, then stare at the slice as if it was talking to her, telling her how delicious it was.\" (Isn't that how we all eat pizza? It speaks to us on an elemental level.)"}, {"userName": "Mary Ann", "userReviewDate": "Jul 07, 2017", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/1610575-mary-ann", "userReview": "Cannot wait to share this with kids. Reynolds' writing explodes during race scenes. And Patty's character is richly drawn. She carries such a load, so much responsibility, taking care of her little sister, caring for her mom, navigating school scene that isn't comfortable or rooted in her own culture. She's vulnerable and strong at the same time. At times I felt like I was hearing Patty tell the story too much instead of seeing it unfold. But this brought me right into Patty's head, helping me hear her voice, understand her thoughts.Loved the track and teamwork elements of this story, with the importance of supporting each other and being in tune, in step with one another."}, {"userName": "Carrie Gelson", "userReviewDate": "Aug 06, 2017", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/7296879-carrie-gelson", "userReview": "Patina is a story of survival. Of keeping on. Family. Connections. Amassing it all around you. Red beads in a multitude of braids. Finger nails painted in a hero\u2019s style. The security in same old, same old turkey wings. Daily car rides filled with chitter chatter. Sunday visits. Patina is a sister. A daughter. A niece. A teammate. A runner. A fast one. Sometimes, it seems that the races speed her away from everything. But each painful and powerful step counts. Each one gets her there.When you are running for two people, it\u2019s not about stamping out the rage. It\u2019s about racing for the love.Resilience. Community. Family. Strength. Power.This book delivers."}, {"userName": "The Reading Countess", "userReviewDate": "Jul 20, 2017", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/2027269-the-reading-countess", "userReview": "Advanced reading courtesy of Edelweiss. Jason Reynolds is a master at getting a character's voice to climb into your head and whisper-read the book with you. I thought I loved Ghost and his foibles. No. Patina is my girl. Don't let her tough exterior fool you. Nope. Underneath, you'll find a second mama to Waffle, a master braider and a wise sage when it comes to selecting true friends. I gobbled this little pancake up in one gulp. Run, don't walk, to grab the baton of this second book in the series."}, {"userName": "Liza Wiemer", "userReviewDate": "Feb 10, 2018", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/3152001-liza-wiemer", "userReview": "Jason Reynolds is absolutely brilliant. Patina's story will keep middle school boys and girls turning the pages.

Loved Ghost, and now seeing the perspective of a second member of the track team, I'm especially eager to hear the next two after this. This is the kind of series, about kids doing their thing and dealing with their lives and showing their resilient spirits, that kids in our classrooms and in our lives need to be reading. The books are engaging and speak to kids in a realistic voice, which will have them clamoring for more. Love!"}], "description": "Patina, or Patty, runs like a flash.

She runs from the reason WHY she\u2019s not able to live with her \u201creal\u201d mom any more: her mom has The Sugar, and Patty is terrified that the disease that took her mom\u2019s legs will one day take her away forever.
