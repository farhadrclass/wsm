No, seriously! hmph!But then, as they say, Der aaye, durust aaye! At least I'm glad to have finally discovered you! (^.^)This is the story of David, who's trying really hard to fit into the friend circle that his best friend of many years is now a part of. David just wants to be considered \"cool\". And that is why he decides (against his better judgement) to partake in some moronic activities (read stealing the cane of a helpless old woman) that his stupid friends indulge in.Once again Louis Sachar turns into a wonderful storyteller, with all this being-under-a-curse-and-witchcraft business.Although I listened to the abridged audiobook version of the story, I thoroughly enjoyed it, esp with the accompanying soundtrack!

But when the plan backfires, he\u2019s the one the \u201cold witch\u201d curses. Now David can\u2019t seem to do anything right. The cool kids taunt him and his only friends are freaks. He even walks into Spanish class with his fly unzipped! And when he finally gets up the nerve to ask out a cute girl, his pants fall down in midsentence. Is it the Bayfield curse at work? Or is David simply turning into a total loser?What I Liked:This review is going to be very abridged! Like a mini-review. David is a young boy in middle school, who is friends with Scott. Except Scott wants to hang out with the cool kids (Randy and Roger), and David isn't quite cool enough to hang out with them. The boys decide to steal an old lady's cane from her, and the old lady places a curse on David! Suddenly everything is going wrong - David breaks his parents' bedroom window, his fly is never zipped, his pants fall down, he spills flour everywhere. Meanwhile, his \"friends\" make fun of him and completely push him out of their circles, and David makes two new friends. But will the curse ever be lifted?This is Middle Grade, if you couldn't tell or didn't know! I haven't read a Middle Grade book in a long time, but I've enjoyed them in the past. I read Holes at least ten years ago, and loved it! This book was great as well.I loved that the author hit so many issues that a kid in middle school would experience: fitting in, liking a girl, being awkward, dealing with younger siblings, growing up, learning good things and bad things. So many great topics Sachar hit in this book, which is pretty great. It takes me back to when I was in middle school! I was surprised to see that this was on the banned list, but as I was reading, I had to constantly remind myself that this book is Middle Grade! Not Young Adult or New Adult or Adult. See my discussion of why this book was banned at the bottom of this post! Overall, I liked following David's story. It was cute, funny, and all too real. I know I haven't said much specifically about the characters or plot, but just know that this is definitely a great book to give new teens!What I Did Not Like:This book was adorable! I don't think I have any dislikes at the moment.Would I Recommend It:For new teens, I'd recommend this book! It's very real, yet very humorous. It's also short, less than 200 pages! It was banned (for reasons we shall ignore), but it's definitely something younger teens will enjoy and relate to!Rating:4 stars. Louis Sachar is such a well-known and talented children's author, so it doesn't surprise me that I liked this book! I wish I had read it as a kid, it was published a few years after I was born! I did read Holes as a kid, and I liked that book a lot."}, {"userName": "Zemkat", "userReviewDate": "Jan 02, 2011", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/4211227-zemkat", "userReview": "This book is a fantastic depiction of the ridiculous nature of junior high. What do you do when your friends start acting weird? How do you respond when people are mean just to get a reaction from you? How far would you go to be cool? Would you ignore your old friends? Reject your family? Would you help beat up an old lady and steal her cane? If you did all that, would it make you cool, or might there be dire consequences for you?I understand why it appears on challenged book lists -- it has disrespect for elders, curses (arcane) and cursing (profane!). On the plus side, it depicts subtle bullying realistically, and characters who respond effectively to it. It also describes good friendships, and how they develop in (what seem like) unlikely ways. As in Louis Sachar's Holes and The Cardturner, the themes of friendship with those rejected by others and of the eventual triumph of quietly choosing the good play a prominent role and provide valuable role models for both young and adult readers."}, {"userName": "Hai Lu", "userReviewDate": "Sep 23, 2014", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/35062288-hai-lu", "userReview": "I saw this book,The Boy Who Lost His Face by Louis Sachar,in the classroom libary and also in several other places but I never really paid attention to it. I also read another book by the same author and the book was quite interesting,so I decided to give this book a try. The other book I read was Holes by Louis Sachar.One thing in this book that impressed me was the plot line of this story. The story starts off with kids attacking the old lady, Mrs. Bayfield, who they thought was a witch and could put curses on them. David, who was also there when the others attacked the poor old lady was \"cursed\" by the old lady right before they ran away. Horrible things started happening to David. In the end, it all ended up as David realizing how guilty he felt about what he had done to Mrs. Bayfield and apologized to her, even though all he did was watch her get attacked by the other kids and flipped his middle finger at her. Mrs.Bayfield at last told him that the curse was just made up. Then years later, David, who was \"cursed\", was admired by a kid ,who was also bullied, because he thought that David was probably a \"hero\". It stood out to me because it seemed really realistic in the world I live in right now. Someone who I thought probably had the best life ever and was admired by everyone today, might be someone who actually suffered for most of their life.I actually found this book significant to our contemporary society. I believe that because I think in our current society, not many are like David, who feels guilty about doing something and punishes himself like what Mrs. Bayfield said, \"You're a caring, thoughtful, considerate human being. Maybe that is a curse in this cold world we live in.\" in page 191."}, {"userName": "Adam Crossley", "userReviewDate": "Mar 24, 2016", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/30919406-adam-crossley", "userReview": "A quick easy read.

To read his stories, one might think that writing is a snap, and that anyone could do it just as well as he; however, I'm sure that a great deal of energy and care must go into the molding of every paragraph that he produces. The kind of realistic narrative voice that Louis Sachar achieves again and again is an example of high art. What is the nature of a curse, and how does it tie in with the quintessence of personal guilt? That is the pressing question batted around between the covers of The Boy Who Lost His Face. When David goes along with a couple of kids with whom he wants to become friends as they pull a mean trick on an elderly woman and steal her walking cane, David knows that he has done wrong, even though he wasn't really an active participant in the malicious mischief. The curse that the woman, named Mrs. Bayfield, calls out after David as he dashes off only strengthens the feelings of guilt that continue to peck at him. Before long, strange things begin happening to David, things that seem to mirror the specific torments that his \"friends\" had inflicted upon the poor old woman, and David can't help but think about the curse that was spoken by Mrs. Bayfield as he departed her house. Could his string of bad luck really be connected to the wrongs that he committed against the old woman? Does a logic-minded boy like David really believe in the idea of hexes and curses, and think that Mrs. Bayfield could actually be a witch who is now helping herself to a serving of revenge at David's expense? As David tries to figure out what's really going on he continues to struggle with the guilt of his actions, even though most of what happened to Mrs. Bayfield was not directly done by him. Louis Sachar shows us the inner workings of a kid in moral conflict, not truly sure how much blame he deserves to shoulder, but knowing deep down that he is not blameless for the actions of others that he condoned simply by his inactive presence. It's these issues of guilt that David wrestles with the most, leading him to realize that what he should really do is go back to Mrs. Bayfield's house and offer a sincere apology for his part in what was done to her. For the same reason behind his spectatorial indifference when his \"friends\" committed their unkindness in the first place, though, David knows that he won't go back and speak to Mrs. Bayfield. He lacks the courage of such proactive intervention, which has really been his biggest problem all along. He's not a bad person; he's just trapped within the confines of his own fears.  As David comes closer and closer to finding out the full truth behind Mrs. Bayfield and the curse that it becomes more and more apparent she must have put on him, the particulars of his situation all seem to rise together to present a challenge: he must stand up to defend his integrity and the honor of his friends and family, or be destined to forever take the coward's way out, and \"lose face\" in every tough situation that confronts him for the rest of his life. It takes just such as in-your-face challenge as this to reveal to David, ultimately, what his true colors can be if he were to ever step up and take a solid stand. Always compelling, the characters that Louis Sachar has created in The Boy Who Lost His Face bring challenges to the forefront that everyone who reads the book has faced, and will face, many times in their lives. The question of whether or not David will stand up to the bullying and manipulation of others is answered in these one hundred ninety-nine pages, but what will we do when faced with our own guilt, or with a wrong that it is in our power to right? The answer to these questions belongs individually to each and every reader, and the choice of how we respond is always ours to make.The Boy Who Lost His Face is a good, solid story, fast-moving and with some moments of warmth as well as humor. I would give it two and a half stars."}, {"userName": "Ayumi Shimoyama", "userReviewDate": "Oct 07, 2013", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/12984514-ayumi-shimoyama", "userReview": "1)Publisher: YEARLING HUMOR Series:?

Not that I can't find something in it worth challenging, I suppose that I could (and in a minute, I will). But it's just such an *unimportant* book compared to the books that are generally challenged. This is the story of David, who wants to be popular, and therefore goes along with the crowd and does something not very nice. He realizes that he shouldn't have done this, and that doing it didn't help his popularity anyway. He lets go of his former best friend and makes new friends with other social outcasts. Meanwhile, he is crushing on a very crushworthy girl, who ends up liking him back. In a not so surpising twist, she is connected to the initial event in the book, and all is made well again.What I did like about this book? The parents. And it was mildly funny in some parts. What I didn't like? It was a book with a thinly disguised and not too deep moral. What I was indifferent about? More or less everything else.Why challenged? My guess? The initial incident is pretty darn disrepectful to elders. Curses are discussed. Characters lie. The middle finger is used. There is a discussion of a photo of a naked young girl, and, although the discussion is more about social inequity than about sex, the discussion probably made some people mad, too. (Quote: How could someone still be happy living in all that poverty?)Research Says:The Boy Who Lost His Face was challenged in 1993 in the Jackson Township Elementary School in Clay City, Indiana due to \"unsuitable words,\" and was also challenged at the Golden View Elementary School in San Ramon, California that same year because of its \"profanity, frequent use of obscene gestures, and other inappropriate subject matter.\" In fact, the book was removed from Cuyler Elementary School in Red Creek, New York in 1993 because \"the age level and use of some swear words may make it inappropriate to younger children.\""}, {"userName": "Javonte Holloway", "userReviewDate": "Mar 09, 2009", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/2112542-javonte-holloway", "userReview": "David helps some boys from his school steeal a cane from Mrs. Bayfield, and old woman who the boys say is a witch.

Quick summary: David succumbs to peer pressure when he breaks an old lady's window, turns her chair over, pours lemonade on her head, breaks her pitcher and steals her cane. Then bad stuff that mirrors the attack starts happening to him. Sachar does a tremendous job portraying David's initial guilt. The story is predictable, but that's not a bad thing. My favorite part was where David and his father explore the concept of social constructs (in regards to flipping someone off)--it's only offensive because the receiving party knows it's offensive, and someone originally had to devise the symbol and its meaning, then explain it. (they also acknowledge that it's bad even if the receiving party doesn't know what it means, just because the offending party DOES and is trying to be hurtful.)

Well at least he thinks they are friends. They are all set on going and stealing a poor old lady's cane. Although the lady had been told to be a witch and when they went she gave them some lemonade. They dumped it on her and stole her cane and David trying to fit in flipped her off. He just hoped that she did not know what it meant. The weird thing was the grandma seemed to have mumbled some words like she was putting a curse on him. A few days later he tried to flip his mom off to see if she knew what it meant, she didn't find it funny. But she soon figured out it was just an experiment. As the days go on he tries asking out the girl he likes tries to fit in but everything goes wrong every time. Read the book to see what happens next.There are a lot of different figurative devices in the book by Louis Sachar. The first one is an onomatopoeia, \"He had drawn a picture of it on his drafting paper, and now, slowly and carefully, he was trying to copy that picture onto a piece of maple wood. Wham!\" (Pg 29) The next one is an imagery, \"She was short and skinny, with very short, straight black hair that hung like a bowl over her head.\" (Pg 29) Next one is a metaphor, \"At least he thought he know that, but those words erased any doubts he still might have had.\" (Pg 144) The next one is another imagery, \" Although the outside of the house was old and run-down, the inside was beautifully and lavishly decorated. (Pg 144) The next and last one is an onomatopoeia, \"The screen door banged shut in front of him.\" (Pg 143)In my opinion this book was a very interesting one. I think that it really kept you on your toes for the whole thing. The characters showed a lot of emotion and they were all very unique. It made sure you knew exactly where you were in the book and exactly what it looked like. Overall this book was very interesting and it was a really fun book to read. You should read it too!"}, {"userName": "Tracey", "userReviewDate": "Jul 11, 2017", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/54682463-tracey", "userReview": "David is your average little boy that just wants to be cool and fit in like the popular boys. When this means being mean to old Mrs Bayfield and stealing her walking cane; David has a rethink about the friendship. Especially now that Mrs Bayfield put a curse on him. She told him that one day she will have his face hanging in her house, just like her husbands was doing now. The curse gets really harsh, and David does not know what to do anymore. He ends up befriending people that he would have normally not bothered with, and ends up with the girl.Was it an actual curse, or was it the fact that David just stood by and did nothing to help, knowing deep down that what they were all doing was wrong. Is it more about losing face than actually losing your face?A good story about friendship, and doing what is right."}, {"userName": "Mollie Brandt", "userReviewDate": "Apr 23, 2018", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/76254200-mollie-brandt", "userReview": "The Boy Who Lost His Face is on the banned books list for 2000 - 2009, but was originally published in 1989. The book was banned for its' references to occult/witchcraft practices, sexuality and bullying. Since this book doesn't seem to have an overwhelming inclusion of these themes, I think it would still be appropriate for Elementary School students. I also do not personally believe that books should be banned on grounds of 'occult' and 'witchcraft' practices; they are parts of society that are not necessarily negative for students to learn about. On the other hand, sexuality may be confusing to some younger students. Bullying is also a topic that I believe all kids should read about because that is something common in Elementary School."}, {"userName": "Neatia", "userReviewDate": "Jan 22, 2018", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/18070762-neatia", "userReview": "Louis Sachar's novels tend to be thought provoking and cast with lively, multi-layered protagonists. This is not an exception. As far as plotting, characterization, and technical skill goes, there's not really much to critique. As far as novels go, it wasn't really my cup of tea. I couldn't tell you why exactly, and I shall have to mull over the question more. I do feel that the themes are a bit jumbled and uncohesive. He utilizes several different themes, but none of them are really brought to maturation, and they stand largely alone with little interrelation, and the novel suffers for it."}, {"userName": "Donna Siebold", "userReviewDate": "Jul 31, 2017", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/15598837-donna-siebold", "userReview": "David really wants to fit into the cool clique his once best friend has joined.

I give this book four out of five stars because it is such an amazing book. It is about a boy named David who tries to be part of the cool crowd. His best friend seems to fit right in but him, not so much. In order to prove that he is cool, the cool crowd go to an old lady\u2019s house to steal her cane. They execute their plan and David gets caught right in the middle. They manage to steal the old lady\u2019s cane, but she yells out a curse towards David. \u201cYour doppleganger will regurgitate on your soul,\u201d she cried out (8). Now, ever since she said that, everything has been going wrong! While they were stealing the cane, they broke her window, pulled down her pants, and pulled her chair down. David breaks his mother\u2019s window, his pants fall down in front of the girl her likes, and falls off of his seat. Is he really cursed? \tWhat I liked about this book is that Sachar really focuses on the issues that middle schoolers go through: trying to fit in, being weird and awkward, dealing with your parents and younger siblings, and growing up. It\u2019s such a real book. I also liked that this book is relevant to our society today. It has so many powerful words and advices. For example, Mrs. Bayfield, the old lady says, \u201cYou\u2019re a caring, thoughtful, considerate human being. Maybe that is a curse in this cold world we live in,\u201d (191). This is probably one of my favorite quotes from the book. What I also liked about the book is how the title fit in well with the book, with David\u2019s story. Most titles connect to the book is a small way, but this title fit in perfectly. There was a scene where one of David\u2019s friends explains what \u201closing face\u201d means. \u201cYou lost face,\u201d he said. \u201cWhen you don\u2019t stand up for yourself, the Japanese say you lose face,\u201d (103). Every time David let himself get pushed around, didn\u2019t stand up for his friends or brother, he lost a little face. I think that\u2019s something I will forever grow up with. I don\u2019t want to lose face, so I\u2019ll stand up for myself and others.\tWhat I did not like about this book is pretty much just the language. For a kids book, I think Sachar added too many curse words and foul language. This book was banned for schools because of it. If it didn\u2019t have those words, I think this book would\u2019ve made a difference in the lives of young scholars. It really hits home. Other than that, every part of this book was amazing. There were all types of scenes, that made you laugh, cry, that got you mad, and excited. Overall, it\u2019s a great book that one can simply learn from. I recommend it for kids, teens, and even adults because the lessons learned from this book, are lessons even adults would benefit from."}], "description": "The classic novel from Newbery Medalist and National Book Award winner Louis Sachar (Holes), with a brand-new cover! \u00a0 David is only trying to be cool when he helps some of the popular kids steal Old Lady Bayfield\u2019s cane.
