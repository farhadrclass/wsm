They're always amusing books because the\"romance\" part is so mild compared to today's books, and the proper behavior of \"ladies\" is so hilarious by our standards (a lot of nastiness couched in polite language).But while this book had the romance thing going on, it also was quite a history lesson! I spent all day finishing the 2nd half without putting it down, too. I SO wanted Garnet to marry her romantic interest, and for Florinda to run off with hers. I loved the characters, I loved the scenery. I loved that the women were strong, not stopped by convention, adventurous ... I'm not sure exactly when this book was written (my old copy has no date!) but it seemed that a lot of the themes were probably pretty scandalous at the time. In any case, I really loved this book more than I expected to, and would recommend it to anyone, especially if you liked Isabelle Allende's book \"Daughter of Fortune.\" Also, if you watched \"Deadwood\" at all, you'd probably recognize a few characters."}, {"userName": "Naomi Sarah", "userReviewDate": "Aug 01, 2015", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/40096835-naomi-sarah", "userReview": "[ I thought Oliver and Garnett's romance was more adorable than John and Garnet's romance.

The story was so simply put over that you never felt like the author was trying to impress you with her knowledge of the times. But I felt like I was there every minute of the way with Garnet. In New York Garnet felt like she was a doll wrapped in tissue paper and set in the closet for safety, but the closeness stifled her. When she met Oliver, he represented everything she didn't have, adventure, excitement and freedom from social rules. He was her ticket to satisfying her curiosity, and she was his ticket to seeing the world through a different lense. Within a short time they were married, for better or for worse.I really don't think anyone could read this book and not like Garnet; she was sweet at the same time as having the strength to do what needed to be done, no matter how hard it was. I felt all her emotions, the strangeness of a new county, the hot, dusty Jubilee Trail that seemed to have no end and the first time Garnet truly felt fear. Maybe she was slightly naive, but she made out ok, and she let herself bend to the wind instead of breaking under it's pressure. It helped that Garnet had mysterious Florinda, who's rough upbringing prepared her for life early on, and it helped that The Handsome Brute was so jolly and of course she had Oliver and his right hand John. Florinda and John were two peas in a pod, both scoffed at what Garnet knew to be important and true, because they didn't understand it. But they understood things Garnet didn't. So they evened each other out, and saw in Oliver what Garnet couldn't see at first. However, I think The Handsome Brute, is the one who helped everyone. His balanced good nature and understating of people made him, Imo, the hero of the book, if not in the romantic sense of the word. There was a bit of mystery shrouding some characters, and it all unfolded as gracefully as a spider weaving it's web, just a tread at a time. And so often it was one of many threads, making it go unnoticed by others in the tale. It was exactly what I was in the mood for, and it hit the spot from page one till the end. PG/PG-13 Some PG-13 elements put over in a PG way if that makes any sense. Ds and Hs are fairly regular, one B and characters are said to say a string of swears, without us having to hear them. One character is a prostitute, but that is more her past, (now she is just a barmaid and we don't go into her work) and a fair bit of the book is in a bar. Burlesque dancing is mentioned, but we don't get any colorful images of it, thank goodness. There are several murders, I'm not telling you if I was pleased to see that some people were no longer walking about. Otherwise it's not objectionable.  I'd say 14/15 years old and up."}, {"userName": "Kate Quinn", "userReviewDate": "May 07, 2009", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/2232084-kate-quinn", "userReview": "One of the first adult historical fiction books I ever read, and a book that still fascinates me. Gwen Bristow is not a well-known writer of historical fiction, but she deserves to be: her characters are interesting and flawed, her settings are meticulously researched, and her writing style is as clear as a pane of glass. Jubilee Trail is the best of her books, centered around the two-tiered society of California as it was just before the Gold Rush, where proud Spanish rancheros existed side by side with Yankee traders and Mexican citizens. Our guide on this journey is Garnet, an adventurous New York society girl who marries Oliver, a handsome trader who takes her on a headlong journey to California rather than a dull life in polite society. Garnet gets more than she bargains for: lifelong friends and bitter enemies, motherhood and widowhood, poverty and luxury. No one she meets on the trail is quite who they seem, including her husband, and the eventual hero of the book will surprise you. Garnet's best friend Florinda, a beautiful showgirl fleeing murder charges and perhaps something even more sinister, steals the show on every page she appears. And how nice to read a historical fiction book that doesn't end with a marriage, as is traditional, but rather begins with one."}, {"userName": "Joselle173", "userReviewDate": "Feb 09, 2008", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/271753-joselle173", "userReview": "Are you serious?

I had just read a book by Sandra Dallas and Nancy Turner so to pick up \"Jubilee Trail\" and see that both of these ladies had written a foreword, just seemed meant to be. What a story. I felt like it was a fantastic history lesson. Florinda and Garnet were two of the most interesting characters I've met up with in a long time. I loved Florinda and found her complex, lacking and wonderful all at the same time. 291: She understood why John loved the earth. The rocks and mountains did not fail you because they could not; even the desert was cruel by its own honest laws. The desert did not promise you roses and waterfalls and then give you rocks and sand. Only people did this.John reminded her of the desert: he offered nothing, but then suddenly he was like a rock guarding a spring. And the water was so much more preicous than all the rivers of home, because when you found it you needed it so.338 You developed that kind of courage because you had to. It was not a matter of noble ideas.

I wish we still used \u2018hell for breakfast\u2019. But, I must go on with my review. Oh hell for breakfast! Another thing I liked about this book: no one else in Weber County wants to read it so I was able to renew it about 32 times. That was handy. This book was first published in 1950, so I think most of the people who have heard of this book are dead now. Hell for breakfast. So the main character\u2019s name is Garnet. She madly in love with a dude who is going to take a mule train from the east coast to California. Bad stuff ensues (hell for breakfast). She has a baby. She works in a saloon. Other stuff happens. Blah blah blah. There ya go. That\u2019s pretty much it. I have no idea how that took up 564 pages. Even as I read the book I was thinking to myself, \u201cHell for breakfast, I have read 50 pages and nothing pretty much has happened.\u201d But for some reason it wasn\u2019t agonizing that nothing happened. I just look back and think, \u201cHuh, I really can\u2019t figure out what filled all those pages.\u201d So, if you are in the mood for an epic novel that vaguely (and probably inaccurately) chronicles early southern California, READ THIS BOOK!

She knew how do it and he did it marvelous. One may think you take some interesting historical background and some more or less original fictional story and you end up with a good historical fiction. No. It isn't definitely enough. Every great writer of this genre has own style, own recipe. And of course Bristow had also.Her books (I have read three her novels) are rich with historical facts but in the way that you don't feel overwhelmed. Thanks to her I know so much about USA history. After each one of the books I had read I searched for more information. I wanted to know more.She showed us a fascinating world. But that world was also wild, hard, sometimes even cruel but that world offered many opportunities for those who dared.She created also great characters. I don't like them all but they all are perfect examples of people who lived then. Through them she described many other women and men.I think, that what she did the best are male characters (especially those who are in closer relationship with a main heroine in some point of the story). In my opinion her male characters are much better created than female characters.All these remarks refer also to Jubilee Trail of course. Reading this book I was completly immersed in those times and with the story. I was a few times totally surprised what had happend. I was thrilled, angry, sad. And these male characters. They are so perfect in their imperfection. Each of them had his own place in the story and in the life of heroine.I love when a book makes own mark in my heart / soul which stays with me for a long time.\"Life let you have what you wanted.

So onto the shelf it went for someday when I didn't have a book in front of me that I HAD to read right then. Well, someday came and I pulled this book out. The forewards hooked me.

I'm not a big fan of westerns or romance novels but it turns out I am a big fan of this book. And the 1950's sensibilities? Oh they are there and I loved it.

Longing for adventure, Garnet marries a man she barely knows, wooed by his stories of magical California, a land that isn't even on the map yet. But the path to California is hard, and Garnet encounters many unpleasant surprises, in the way of bandits, hostile natives, even more hostile in-laws, and a husband who is nothing like the charming man who courted her. The characters are richly drawn, from Garnet to Florinda, the dance hall girl she befriends, plus a host of Chinese immigrants, a giant Russian, and the cattle ranchers and prospectors who are trying to make their fortune in the territory.

The last 50 pages of the book taunted me. For once in a while, I actually felt I was reading a REAL NOVEL. I loved reading about the stoic westward travelers. I grew up in California, memory's shadow tickled me with nostalgia- seeing the names of towns and trying to recall events learned in history class. It was not some sloppy love novel with graphic scenes to target my hormones, but was rich with characters who were faulted and yet good, and my heart ached with understanding.I did finish the book late after work one night and am now content!

This is a good story with such likeable characters, but it is also a chronicle of life in California when it was still a part of Mexico and in pre-gold rush days. The history is all intertwined as California is annexed into the US and Los Angeles and San Francisco are rough and ready new settlements with a mix of Californios, Yankees, Mexicans and small remnants of several Native American tribes. Really enjoyed this one."}, {"userName": "Abigail", "userReviewDate": "Jul 30, 2016", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/7022064-abigail", "userReview": "My dear friend lent me this book. I have to confess that the first ninety pages felt slow to me, but I am sssooooo happy that I kept reading. The story builds and then slows a little and then out of nowhere it punches you in the face with a plot twist that you never expected. Once I became emotionally invested in the characters - who, in completely different ways are rich, complex, and therefore, endearing - I couldn't stop reading. Even when I really needed to. I can't say just how much I enjoyed how each character's \"tale of woe\" is revealed. And then you love them all even more. I wept, I chuckled, I put the book down in disbelief, excitement, or mortification repeatedly. And to top it all, I came away from this story, truly wishing these characters really existed. ...well, NOT Charles. Horrid, nasty piece of work.And if John Ives could read this, he'd cringe as he read these words: I loved this book and am so grateful to my friend, Sarah for lending it to me. It was quite a ride."}, {"userName": "Zora", "userReviewDate": "Sep 27, 2014", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/8291584-zora", "userReview": "I really liked this 1950 novel about a proper New York girl longing for adventure mid-19th Century, getting married, and taking a trek with her new husband along a wagon trail to the nation of California--which wasn't even on the globes out east yet--where further adventures await her. In style, it's of its era, and I mean that as a complement. (Would that the average popular novel today were written this well, or as well as Mary Stewart's Gothics. But the \"middlebrow\" novel disappeared in about 1980, and I certainly miss it.) In the depiction of female characters, it's years ahead of its time. (It's mostly shelved a romance here, but it's really a story of a female friendship more than a romance.) Some lovely descriptions and surprising human insights. Had females chosen the canon, no doubt some of the mid-century novelists would have been booted off the list to be replaced by this book and Edna Ferber books."}, {"userName": "Readitnweep", "userReviewDate": "Dec 30, 2012", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/3576329-readitnweep", "userReview": "This is not the edition I read - I have an old copy from the 1950s.I didn't enjoy this book as much as I had Bristow's Celia Garth, which I could not put down, but I did enjoy it.This historical story set in the 1840s is well paced and packed with events and characters - with some historical figures. It is not graphic in text, though, so don't look for a lot of historical accuracy, in terms of the graphic nature of living in the west at the time, but it does include wonderful description and some historical details.The plot is fairly predictable, though there were a couple avenues I expected the author to take, regarding Garnet's relationship with other characters that she did not take - much to my pleasant surprise. It is important to keep in mind this is a romance - and a well written one. I'd recommend this book as an enjoyable read, but I'd recommend Celia Garth first."}, {"userName": "Kristin", "userReviewDate": "Nov 01, 2009", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/2897303-kristin", "userReview": "This is a great historical fiction novel. While I have read better, this book accomplishes everything the author sets out to do. It's really a coming-of-age story, as Garnet slowly realizes that her husband is not perfect, that even \"soiled doves\" can be good people, and that her true soul mate just might be a man who doesn't believe in love.While I really enjoyed this book, it definitely has its weaknesses. Bristow wrote Jubilee Trail in the 50s, and at times it seems a bit dated in terms of phrasing and childish plot.Overall, this is the quintessential westward expansion novel, and I enjoyed reading it very much. I wish there had been a bit more resolution at the end, especially for some of the beloved secondary characters. On a side note, I've been wanting to see the film adaptation, but every time it comes on TCM, I seem to miss it!"}, {"userName": "Adrianna", "userReviewDate": "Jul 13, 2015", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/865009-adrianna", "userReview": "I LOVED this book. It was extremely detailed, which made for long reading, but I don't think I would have wanted it pared down at all. The lengthy telling provided fascinating insights to pioneer life on the Jubilee Trail and emotionally connected the reader to the characters in a very vivid way. I felt all of Garnet's emotions as my own- my heart ached with her, I felt disappointment, grief, fear, her wonder at the beauteous landscapes, her yearning, and her jubilation and thrill.The unlikely friendship that forms between Garnet and Florinda is beautiful in its unconditional acceptance and devotion. And the support group that Garnet musters in the remote wilds of the American continent is heartwarming.This is often an emotionally-wrenching novel, but extremely satisfying in its own beautiful and inspiring way."}, {"userName": "Peggy ", "userReviewDate": "Aug 16, 2014", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/2796355-peggy", "userReview": "This was first published in 1950. When I was about 12 or 13 in the early 60's I read Mom's hardback. I was thrilled to get this for Kindle on sale a while back but did not like the modernized cover so even though I read it on Kindle I used the hardback edition cover from 1950 as the one I read. Much more realistic!This was one of my favorite books as a young teen and I enjoyed it just as much this time around. Gwen Bristow wrote what would be considered today as clean historical fiction with most of the romance behind doors. But she really did her research and wrote very memorable characters. The only reason that I didn't give it 5 stars is because of her portrayal of Native Americans."}], "description": "The history of California in the mid-19th century comes alive in this captivating historical novel. Garnet Cameron, a fashionable young lady of New York, is leading a neat, proper life, full of elegant parties and polite young men, yet the prospect of actually marrying any of them appalls her. Yearning for adventure, she instead marries Oliver Hale, a wild trader who is about to cross the mountains and deserts to an unheard-of land called California. During Garnet and Oliver's honeymoon in New Orleans, she meets a dance-hall performer on the lam who calls herself Florinda Grove and is also traveling to California. Along the Jubilee Trail, Garnet and Florinda meet kinds of men never known to them before, and together they make their painstaking way over the harsh trail to Los Angeles, learning how to live without compromise and discover both true friendship and true love.", "title": "Jubilee Trail", "url": "https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/74725.Jubilee_Trail", "average": 4.1, "cover": "https://images.gr-assets.com/books/1388256044l/74725.jpg", "reviews": 340, "authors": [{"url": "https://www.goodreads.com/author/show/42378.Gwen_Bristow", "name": "Gwen Bristow"}, {"url": "https://www.goodreads.com/author/show/74078.Sandra_Dallas", "name": "Sandra Dallas"}, {"url": "https://www.goodreads.com/author/show/29184.Nancy_E_Turner", "name": "Nancy E.
