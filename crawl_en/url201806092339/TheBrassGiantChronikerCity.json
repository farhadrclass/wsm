I think it's competently written. The plot is solid and the characters fairly well-realized -- but it felt to me like a romance novel with some steampunk elements shoehorned in. Granted, those steampunk elements are finely detailed and fun, but they were few and far between compared to the protagonist mooning over the boy she loves, but does she love her? And oh, he's from a wealthy family and they could never be together because she's a mere shopgirl, and his family are all classist snobs, but wait... There's nothing wrong with that story, but it's just not my thing. Based on the jacket copy, I was hoping for a bit more conspiracy and mystery. In truth, it really felt like a footnote to Petra's romantic angst. To be fair, the ending did set up a lot of promise for the next volume, so I may give the sequel a shot."}, {"userName": "Eoghann Irving", "userReviewDate": "Dec 21, 2014", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/1135979-eoghann-irving", "userReview": "Okay so this is a slightly unusual situation. I'm reviewing a book that won't be published until 2015, but it was published when I bought it. That's because the author self-published and then subsequently sold the book and a sequel to a major publisher.That explanation out of the way let's talk about The Clockwork Giant by Brooke Johnson. It's a Young Adult novel with a steampunk setting and a heavy emphasis on romance. So this isn't going to be to everyone's tastes. But I think you should judge stories based on what they are aiming to be, not some universal constant ideal.Tick TockWhile the genre is steampunk the real emphasis in this story is on clockwork. There are other technologies certainly but the central character Petra loves clockwork and the author does a great job both of showing that fascination and of making a rather dry and technical subject matter interesting to the reader.That's not easy to do when you consider that the vast majority of those readers won't know most of the terms that the characters use when talking about building or fixing clockwork items. There's a real danger with scenes of that sort that people will just zone out or lose interest completely.Johnson finds a good balance here, giving the technical details necessary both for plot and atmosphere while not actually bogging the story down with them.When And Where?We're never explicitly told when The Clockwork Giant is set. Though we do know that it is in Britain and if you combine the various references to Luddites and a number of historical figures you could probably narrow it down fairly well. We are told enough though to have a good feeling for where in the timestream this all happens.By chosing to set this in the fictional Chroniker City, Johnson avoids some of the issues that writers can get bogged down in when using real locations. On the other hand, she can't rely on anyone's familiarity in order to set the feel of the place.And that does hurt the story a bit I think. After reading it, I really can't tell you what the place was supposed to be like. In my head it really just consists of a small handful of locations that I can't quite connect together.Looking To The Future From The PastSteampunk is a strange sub-genre. It's a branch of science fiction that usually (though not exclusively) makes use of alternate history to give us a world full of giant steam powered machines and other Victorian era stylings.Like much science fiction steampunk is generally quite interested in technology, but this is not technology that we are likely to ever see invented, being as it usually is made of metal and powered by steam. So one of the appeals is clearly a mythical past. The Victorian era is visually and mentally quite appealing so long as you don't actually have to live there.Because the other side of this setting that authors usually struggle with is that socially it is pretty backwards (by the standards of the 21st century). So we do tend to get a lot of plucky heroines who refuse to fit into society's rigid codes. Done right you can get some insightful commentary on todays society. Done wrong you just get bludgeoned over the head with how horrible people were to women.I'm not sure that The Clockwork Giant really gives us much in the way of social commentary. But I'm also fairly sure it wasn't trying to. Petra's social limitations are definitely a driver for the plot, but they aren't allowed to dominate it. And indeed her interest in becoming an engineer is essentially a selfish one of the sort you might expect a young person to have. She shows no real interest in reforming anything.Plucky, Petulant, PetraWhich brings me quite nicely to our heroine. She is the sole viewpoint character for the story so her attitude very much colors everything we see. And I must say I found her a quite believable if at times annoying protagonist. Again, keep in mind this is aimed at the Young Adult audience and I am clearly outside the core demographic.Petra is brave, impulsive and clever but also a bit willful and self-obsessed. All fairly normal characteristics for a young protagonist really. There were a few places where I found her sulking and flouncing rather annoying, but most of the time it was easy enough to root for her.Ewww Kissing!There is a lot of romance in this novel. It's easily the dominant mode. Petra spends most of her time either irritated by, mooning over or kissing Emmerich. I would personally probably have enjoyed it more if the ratio of action to romance was a little more even. But that is just personal preference.The romance as presented is solidly done. Emmerich comes across as the sort of person Petra could easily fall for so it is reasonably believable. Or as much as one of these \"romance across social boundaries\" type of plots can be.Where I think the romance element really hurt things though was that Emmerich is really the only other character in the book to get developed. The rest of the supporting cast are in truth little more than ciphers. Even the jealous suitor/childhood friend comes across as a collection of plot necessary characteristics. So much time is spent building the romance that the rest get very short shrift.Which is a shame because I think developing them further would have given the world considerably more depth to it, at least in my head. And there are little hints that the characters have more going on in their lives. They just never get the chance to share any of it.Young Adult RomanceSo assuming you can enjoy Young Adult Romance, this book would be worth your time. If you could buy it, which you can't right now but will be able to again next year. While steampunk flavors it heavily that probably wouldn't be enough on its own for people who don't enjoy romance stories.However if you look at what the book is trying to do and who its (presumably) intended audience is, this is solid to good. It's considerably better in fact than a significant portion of published YA material."}, {"userName": "Louise", "userReviewDate": "Jul 08, 2015", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/2450538-louise", "userReview": "Juvenile writing and plotting. You'd think a book about a woman engineer trying to infiltrate an all-male engineering Guild would appeal to me, but while the premise was good, the dialog read like fan fiction and the plot was both predictable and unbelievable. For how smart Petra is supposed to be, she makes a bunch of stupid decisions."}, {"userName": "Maria", "userReviewDate": "May 04, 2015", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/2745176-maria", "userReview": "I received a complimentary copy of this book as a part of a book tour for a fair and honest review. I rated this 4 out of 5 Stars.A steampunk novel set in the early 1860\u2019s, The Brass Giant by Brooke Johnson is an enjoyable mid length story with colorful characters, sharp dialogue, a bit of mystery and a touch of romance. While a book dealing with mechanics and machinery, Ms. Johnson creates a world that is fairly easy to understand, even for those of us not mechanically inclined. In addition Ms. Johnson tackles some of society\u2019s issues of the time: poverty, the lack of women\u2019s rights and quality education being denied to the poor. If you\u2019re looking for something a little different in your historical reading, you\u2019re going to want to give this book a try.Naturally intelligent and mechanically gifted, Petra Wade wants nothing more than to be an engineer and become a member of \u201cThe Guild\u201d, something denied to her due to the misfortune of being born a girl. Donning a disguise, dressed as a man and using her brother\u2019s first name, Petra attempts to bluff her way into the university but is unable to enroll due to a lack of money and lack of a transcript. Continuing to work as a shop girl, Petra works on any machine she can get her hands on and refuses to give up on her dream. Especially after she meets Emmerich Goss, a new member of \u201cThe Guild\u201d who recognizes her from her attempt to gain entrance into the university, who needs help designing a new clockwork for a top-secret automaton and turns to Petra for help. Ms. Johnson does a good job developing both Petra and Emmerich\u2019s characters right from the start. I was able to connect with both characters and understood Petra\u2019s anger at the injustice of being denied an education and \u201ccareer\u201d as an engineer due to her gender. Ms. Johnson also does a good job showing how the class separation and financial struggles of the day kept many gifted people from being able to pursue their dreams. The friendship and mutual respect that grows between Petra and Emmerich is based on their shared interests and a desire for self-improvement. They in essence fell for each other\u2019s brain first.The secondary characters are well developed and made some very interesting contributions to the story. I especially liked Mr. Sticket, Petra\u2019s boss at the shop, who was also her secret teacher and who believed in Petra\u2019s talent. While \u201cThe Guild\u201d was originally presented as the villain, as it were, of the story, it turns out that there are several different factions at play and most of them don\u2019t have good intentions.Will Petra be able to help Emmerich design the clockwork required for the new automaton? Will their budding romance get in the way of Petra realizing her dreams? You\u2019ll have to read The Brass Giant to find out. I enjoyed it and look forward to reading the next book in this series."}, {"userName": "Fred Hughes", "userReviewDate": "Mar 01, 2012", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/7119280-fred-hughes", "userReview": "Not much steampunk in this steampunk story.Lots of girl power and romance, sort of.It didn't hold my attention so I gave up."}, {"userName": "Darby Karchut", "userReviewDate": "Nov 28, 2011", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/4359524-darby-karchut", "userReview": "A solid debut novel - this author knows how to write, let me tell you.

Then she meets a Guild student who's willing to work with her. But will Emmerich simply take her designs and claim them as his own? Beautiful world-building. I found Petra's work with timepieces and music boxes fascinating, and the steam and grime of the under-city captured my imagination. But then things got much too swoony for my tastes. Lots of stuttering hearts, tingling lips, lingering touches, and earnest declarations. None of which really contributed to either the plot or any kind of character development. Not bad storytelling, but the romance leans too heavily on cliches."}, {"userName": "Marlene", "userReviewDate": "May 19, 2015", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/7001837-marlene", "userReview": "Originally published at Reading RealityThe story outline is a familiar one, but the steampunk setting changes up some of the elements in some very interesting ways.The plot is simple \u2013 underprivileged girl with big dreams meets highly privileged guy who will help her realize her dreams, but only if she helps him with super-secret project. This is a society where no one believes that women have intelligence or capability, so no one important will suspect she is really helping him. And of course they fall in love, and get caught, not necessarily in that order, and discover that the entire enterprise is much more serious, and much, much more dangerous, than they ever imagined.Add in one final element \u2013 that underprivileged girl is an orphan, who turns out to be the heir of someone very, very special.The steampunk setting gives us somewhat of a time and place reference. Chroniker City is definitely in England (that turns out to be important later) and it is a university town like Oxford or Cambridge. It isn\u2019t London, because London is referred to as the capitol far away.As steampunk, The Brass Giant is set in a quasi-Victorian era. There is a queen on the throne, and some of the historical worthies who have their portraits in the great hall are familiar, most notably Charles Babbage, inventor of the difference engine that evolved into computers in our world.In the late Victorian era, England was playing what has been called \u201cThe Great Game\u201d, an undercover war of diplomacy and proxies. In the Chroniker City world, their main rival seems to be France instead of Russia. But then again, Britain and France were perpetual rivals, from the point where Henry II and his wife Eleanor of Aquitaine ruled England in 1154 until well after the end of the Napoleonic Wars of the early 1800s. This was a conflict that never seemed to end.Petra Wade is an orphan. She works as a shop girl in a pawnshop, and has learned how to be a fantastically good practical engineer with the help of the clockmaker who co-owns the shop. More than anything else, she wants to become a Guild Engineer, but that dream is forbidden. Guild Engineers must graduate from the University, and women are allowed in neither the University nor the Guild.But Petra wants more than her life is mapped out to be. In spite of constant humiliation, she pursues her dream, even attempting to enter the University pretending to be male. All she faces is more and more embarrassment.Until one young Guild Engineer, Emmerich Goss, discovers her talent. He needs her help to build a giant automaton. It\u2019s a top secret project for the Guild, and he can\u2019t enlist the aid of anyone they might suspect. The project is so secret that it is treason for Emmerich to reveal it. So of course he does.Petra is good at clockworks, and Emmerich has invented a remote control mechanism. Together, they create a marvel. Only to discover that someone plans to use their great invention to start a war. And that Emmerich is forced to save Petra\u2019s life by condemning her as a traitor.They say you always hurt the one you love. Emmerich finds that true in more ways than one.Escape Rating B: This is fun steampunk. While there is a romance between Petra and Emmerich, it is very sweet and almost innocent for most of the book. Petra falls in love for the first time because Emmerich both shares her interests and treats her as an equal. Emmerich loves her brilliance and her dedication. They are good together.One of the plot twists in the story is that the orphaned Petra is the daughter of the city\u2019s founder and first engineer, Lady Adelaide Chroniker. Which both makes Petra kind of a secret princess and puts the lie to the current Guild malarkey that only men can become engineers.The way that Petra and Emmerich find each other, and all the political secrets they get stuck dealing with, along with Petra\u2019s lineage, reminded me more than a bit of Marissa Meyer\u2019s Cinder. (The original version of The Brass Giant came out before Cinder was published, so this is an interesting coincidence that just shows that great plots can come out of the same seed with no knowledge of each other).While I like Petra as the heroine a lot, she is also an example of the plucky heroine who always \u201cknows\u201d that she doesn\u2019t belong in the place where tragedy has dropped her.On that other hand, one of the characters who seemed a bit too bad to be true was her childhood friend Tolly. Although they were clearly playmates as little children, when they grew up Tolly became an overbearing bully who spouted the same filth and degradation about women as his father, and then blamed Petra for not choosing him over Emmerich. The scene where Tolly attempts to beat and rape Petra into compliance, blaming her for his thuggery, came out a bit too much like a modern-day Men\u2019s Rights Activist. He\u2019ll give Petra everything she ought to want if she\u2019ll just give in, and he\u2019ll beat her until she admits that he\u2019s right and it\u2019s all her fault he has to beat her.The plot that Petra and Emmerich find themselves caught in the middle of is suitably politically underhanded. Someone wants to start a war, and is looking for plausible causes and convenient scapegoats. The way that Petra and Emmerich try to either escape the evil clutches or foil the plot has many hair-raising moments, but is ultimately unsuccessful in the main. The small victories give Petra and Emmerich (and their readers) hope for the future..They will live to fight another day. I\u2019m looking forward to reading their further adventures."}, {"userName": "Jo  (Mixed Book Bag)", "userReviewDate": "Aug 22, 2017", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/1372248-jo-mixed-book-bag", "userReview": "Brooke Johnson lives where I do and I met her when she was doing a signing at our local Barnes and Nobel.

If only she could convince the members of the Guild that she has the skills needed to earn her a place within its walls.But Petra doesn't know who she is, she's one of the victims of the Guild fire, she lost her family and her heritage. Her days are spent working as a shop girl cleaning and tinkering with damaged clocks and similar small machines.But when she sees a young engineer showing off his automaton, she can't help pointing out its flaws.

Ms. Johnson explains in simple language that even I can understand the details of the project that our heroine, Petra Wade, and the university student and boy she comes to like, Emmerich Goss, are building. We travel back in time to 1860s England, a time when girls had few rights and Petra\u2019s dream of being an engineer was just that - only a dream. She\u2019s an orphan and lives in the slums. She sweeps the pawn shop, until one day, she meets Emmerich, and her life changes forever. They team up to build an automaton that might possibly save the world, or else destroy it. If she is discovered working with him, Emmerich will be marked for treason and Petra for death. The Clockwork Giant is a story of mystery, determination, and love between a boy and girl from different backgrounds. Will they succeed in making the world a better place in which to live, or will The Guild stop them?It took me awhile to get into the story, but once I did, I couldn\u2019t stop reading. The Clockwork Giant introduced me to a period in history that I wasn\u2019t familiar with. The ending left me wanting to know more. The good news is that Petra and Emmerich\u2018s story will continue. The next book in The Chroniker City Series will be out in the winter of 2012. I\u2019m looking forward to learning what happens next. Can our heroine overcome the obstacles that await her and Emmerich? Ms. Johnson\u2019s book would make a good addition to high school libraries where students could experience a time in history quite different from the one they live in.

Review will be crossposted to my blog on May 4The Brass Giant, first published in 2011 under the title The Clockwork Giant, is a short and sweet novel about a girl named Petra who wants to be an engineer, a desire thwarted by the fact that she was born female. Trying to sneak into university, she catches the eye of Emmerich Goss who realizes her inborn talent and comes to her for help with his secret project. There's a lot to like in this book: unlike other books where the protagonist happens to deus-ex-machina her way into a learning institution she otherwise couldn't get into, she can't. At the end of the book, when she does get her wish fulfilled, it's decidedly a bittersweet victory and the circumstances surrounding are hardly what would you call ideal. The budding romance builds up at a pace that makes sense and I enjoy the fact that it's a match of minds as much of anything else. I could have done with the jealous non-boyfriend, and I wish there was more to the Luddites hatred of the Guild. While we can personally see why the Guild is bad, there's nothing in what we see in the day-to-day life that would indicate the kind of corruption they suggest. While more rounded it out than most novels of this length (sub-200 pages) this is one area in which it was lacking.Reviewing the author's Goodreads page, there is a novella due to be republished in June and a third book (length unknown) due in September. I do hope the third book is of a longer length so this world can truly be fleshed out.

She has taught herself how to be a clockwork engineer with the help of her employer. The sexist views of the Guild only allow males to study at the institution and she has to find a way in.

The society she lives in is sexist and operates under a heavy caste system. The poor don\u2019t get ahead, especially if they happen to be women. The way women are treated isn\u2019t glossed over in the least. Because it\u2019s all coming from the perspective of someone in the position \u2013 I think it\u2019s easier to relate to her. I instantly felt for her because of this. She has this dream and passion and will do anything to fulfill it. Then all of the action starts taking place but it felt like it quickly got drowned out by this very intense romantic interlude. I don\u2019t mind romance but this relationship felt a bit over the top. There were instances that seemed so elaborate and drawn out it would actually push me out of the story entirely. I wanted more of the action, more of the Petra who had a strong passion for engineering. I didn\u2019t mind that she fell in love but it almost felt like she began putting her passion more into her new love interest than the engineering. The steampunk themes were very well detailed through out the book and I appreciated the glossary at the end. In the way that the movie Titanic is more about a romance happening on a sinking ship, I felt this was more a romance happening in an older steampunk society that happened to have some series conflict going on.

For the longest time I'd been looking to dabble into a steampunk book.

Again, I really wanted to like this book and every time Johnson dove deep into mechanics, engineering, and elements of fiction, I was able to start to enjoy, but it didn't last long because I found myself going back to copper eyes, a dimple smile, and lots of yearning of all sorts. It's not so much that I dislike romance, it's just that my expectations were way off for what I ended up reading and that was a little frustrating. Imagine you see a trailer for a movie promising robots, fiction, and intense action and then finding yourself with the Notebook. It was a tough read for me because I held hope that some twist would surprise me up to the end, yet for me, it never happened. Am I saying that no one will enjoy this book? Not at all. I'm just saying that if romance is not your cup of tea, take heed. If you're expecting something where fiction and action take center stage, then the same. If on the other hand you enjoy fiction to have a good dose of romance, elements of engineering, and some action, then by all means, give this a shot.

My 2nd steam punk style book in a week....and I am addicted, for sure. Jumping straight into this book was a challenge, not only was I coming directly off another steam punk book, but this book also had a determined leading female. Petra wants so much out of life that it hurts. She knows she's got the talent to hang with these upper class inventors, but within the settings of The Brass Giant she can't exactly do that. After plenty of trying she finally finds her out, or should I say \"in\", with Emmerich. The dynamic between these 2 was very well thought out. Not only were they complete opposites, but they were opposites that completed each other's faults, or what the other was lacking. Emmerich felt truly genuine to me, he did want Petra to succeed...but there were times when I wondered if he wanted it more. Overall the end vibe of this book was amazing! Each plot came together, the bad \"people\" threw me for a loop. I'm happy to say that I can see this series going far. Petra & Emmerich will be one of those famous series couples you'll need to watch out for, because their story will either end happily or in heart break."}, {"userName": "Chris", "userReviewDate": "May 14, 2015", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/12217227-chris", "userReview": "Petra Wade, a young woman working in a pawn shop fixing 'tickers'. Her sole dream in life was to go to University, become an engineer and join the Guild. She even goes so far as to dress in her brothers clothes and try to register at University however her ruse is detected and she's turned away. On her slow walk that day back to the pawn shop to work she sees something that changes her life. A group of young engineers walking along and one has an automaton that is following him and doing his commands. Petra makes it a point to examine the automaton and meets the young man, Emmerich, whom she astounds with her knowledge of engineering. Emmerich is so amazed by what she knows that he makes it a point to ask her to assist him in finishing the automaton and fixing some of the problems that it has. I'll leave the rest of what happens to you, the reader of this excellent book, to find out as I did. This kept me up late a few nights reading just one more page or just to the end of the chapter. If you're like me and like Steampunk this is one book you need to read in my opinion. I'm looking forward to more of the Chroniker City tales."}, {"userName": "Kay Solo", "userReviewDate": "Sep 21, 2016", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/2115834-kay-solo", "userReview": "I would have finished this book sooner if I had the time; already I was reading it in class and on the bus when I probably should have been reading things for school. Whoops.This was a solid steampunk book. It's clear the author did her research, and it wasn't just a few elements here and there -- it was the whole thing. It was just what I wanted and needed.I will say that there is a heavy romantic element to this book I did not expect. It didn't necessarily detract from my experience, but I'm not typically much of a romance reader. Since it takes such a dominant role in the book, that might be something to consider when picking it up.That all said, it was well written with solid pacing and storytelling, a few mysterious subplots here and there, and a variety of interesting, distinct characters. There were also many loose ends tied up at the end, but a few left tantalizingly open-ended to encourage you to move on to the next book. At least for me, it worked. If you're looking to pick up a good steampunk series, I'd recommend this one for sure."}, {"userName": "Mari Stroud", "userReviewDate": "Dec 20, 2011", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/5098854-mari-stroud", "userReview": "This book is delightful! I'm fairly well-read in YA, but I don't read much in the way of steampunk; however, I loved this. The plot zips along, the world-building is rich and detailed without becoming overwhelming, and Johnson does a great job of constructing a heroine that pings with a modern audience without losing sight of the very different social mores that a proper Victorian young lady would be expected to follow. Petra is a fun, proactive protagonist that had me rooting for her the whole way, and Emmerich would have drawn many a swoon from me when I was thirteen. I wanted to take him by the lapels and shake him a bit when it was all said and done, but in a generally benevolent way: he's capable of being better. Can't wait to see where Johnson goes with this series next."}, {"userName": "Nancy", "userReviewDate": "Nov 07, 2015", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/970459-nancy", "userReview": "Bold, confident writing introduces Petra Wade a shop girl, who dreams of being an engineer in a wonderfully complex steampunk Great Britain where only men may enroll in the University.

Petra soon becomes entangled in a web of lies, politics, and espionage.

This is the first time I've ever read Steampunk. Brooke takes you into a world where an orphan struggles in an era where women didn't go to college to be an engineer for clockworks. She had training through with a clock repair man in a pawn shop. There she was discovered by a young man in need of her assistance while he worked on his final design for graduation. The story is magnificently done, and very well-written, lots of unexpeceted twists and turns. A girls real struggle in a world dominated by men, and her drive to do what was right. I see this making a movie for sure someday. It may even become a classic someday."}, {"userName": "Angela Brown", "userReviewDate": "Dec 13, 2011", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/6124777-angela-brown", "userReview": "The Clockwork Giant is the first book in the Chroniker City series.

Her intelligence? Well, let me not get carried away. Don't want to put out any spoilers.It's definitely a steampunk novel with technology at its core, and the romantic relationship between Petra and Emmerich adds a layer of steam so thick, it's intoxicating.I basked in each page, suspended in Chroniker City, 1881, adoring each scene as they unfolded.The Clockwork Giant is a MUST READ!"}, {"userName": "Shandi", "userReviewDate": "Nov 30, 2011", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/7083309-shandi", "userReview": "My favorite books are those that combine a bit of mystery, a touch of suspense, a lot of fantasy, and a smidgen of not too over the top romance. The Clockwork Giant has all of that and more. I love the unexpected twists, the sweet, ambitious Petra, and the entire set of Chroniker City. The way Brooke describes her world makes it easy to imagine yourself walking the streets smelling the fuel of the undercity and seeing the fantastical clockworks. I'm a fast reader, but I even surprised myself when I first finished this book in a day. We all know that's the sign of a great book!
