It was recently published on 4/17/18 by Atria Books, an imprint of Simon & Schuster, 352 pages. The genres are adult, mystery, thriller, and fiction.My Experience: I started reading The Elizas on 3/26/18 and finished it on 4/7/18. This book is an okay read. I like the glimpse into the author\u2019s experience when comes to publishing a book. I smile following the discussion between Eliza and her agent about bloggers & instagramers reviewing her book and getting tons of advance review copy requests. It\u2019s fun to read about the other side because I am on the blogger\u2019s side. I like the main character\u2019s dry sarcastic humor when she couldn\u2019t find her phone because she worries she has been missing hours of news from Instagram, Snapchat, Facebook, etc even statuses on some relatives she doesn\u2019t even like. This is my first read from the author even though I am aware of her other books.This book is told in the first person point of view following Eliza Fontaine, a young woman with a record for attempted suicides by drowning in hotel pools. When she was yet found in the bottom of another hotel pool, her mom wanted to send her to a psychiatric home for treatment. However, Eliza claims that this time she didn\u2019t intentionally try to hurt herself but was pushed by someone. She couldn\u2019t remember the details because she had ingested some drinks with her medications. In past suicide attempts, Eliza also explained the same reasons but when doctors performed a brain scan, they said that she suffered from a tumor pressing against an amygdala. This pressure causes the body to tell the brain how to react to emotions. Before the current incident, the tumor has been removed. Since the current incident is so similar to her past attempts, no one believes Eliza of what she claims to be true. The story goes parallel with a book Eliza authored calls The Dots, where the character named Dot suffers seizures but not knowing exactly the causes. In Eliza\u2019s book, Dot is very close to her aunt Dorothy and resents her mom for always working. In Eliza\u2019s life, she lives with two roommates and not very close with her mom and family, but adores her aunt Eleanor. Eliza often has blackouts where she doesn\u2019t remember what happened in the chunk of time that passed by. Since no one believes her, Eliza set out to investigate what happened. This book narrates between Eliza and her book\u2019s main character, Dot.This book has an interesting take when comes to alternating through two separate stories. I don\u2019t enjoy reading about characters with false memory so much because it makes the story slow going. There are some oddities that I don\u2019t enjoy reading, such as her quickies with guys that hardly have any background info from a bar. Eliza just takes Desmond\u2019s words without questions. She puts a move on him and he backs away, yet he came back to ask her out. Everything I read and thought I understand started to change because of Eliza\u2019s false memory. I was able to guess about Dot\u2019s aunt Dorothy but this type of story just couldn\u2019t hold my attention. I still recommend everyone to read it and form your own opinion.Pro: easy to read, fast paced, dry sarcastic humor,Con: slow story building, just not my cup of tea in general with false memoryI rate it 3 stars!***Disclaimer: Many thanks to Atria Books for inviting me to host a blog tour.

Eliza is a troubled individual, both her past and present self. I found her irritating at times, but I understood her current paranoia. When she's pulled from the bottom of a swimming pool yet again, her family is convinced it's another suicide attempt, but Eliza thinks she was pushed in. Whose story is to be believed?And then there's Dot. This is a book within a book, as chapters from Eliza's novel THE DOTS alternate with her own. I enjoyed this set up quite a bit, because it added to the overall madness of the situation. After a while it was hard to tell who was real and who was the character.\u00a0Though some parts were a bit far-fetched, it was still a fun and strange read, especially if you love unreliable narrators.Disclosure: I received a copy of this book from the publisher in exchange for an honest review."}, {"userName": "Elizabeth of Silver's Reviews", "userReviewDate": "Feb 19, 2018", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/1882027-elizabeth-of-silver-s-reviews", "userReview": "Eliza and Dot - one is a real person, and the other is a character in Eliza\u2019s book.The similarities are striking and a bit confusing.We follow both Eliza and Dot as they move through situations both in real life and in Eliza's book.The book begins as Eliza was pulled out of a swimming pool, and no one believes that it was an accident since she previously tried to commit suicide. Doctors and family members also question her story and her memory about many things, but are they just trying to make her think she can\u2019t remember things?THE ELIZAS was odd, but interesting. The characters seemed to be trying to put Eliza in a bad light even though Eliza\u2019s publicist met with her and said the stunt with the pool was a brilliant tactic for publicity.Were they really worried about Eliza or their book sales? Was anyone really worried about Eliza or just themselves?Eliza couldn't let everyone think she had purposely jumped in the pool and was more interested in clearing up the story the police are telling everyone about the pool incident than worrying about publicity for her book.Each chapter was titled Eliza or Dot, and the ending of the chapters about Eliza seemed to have someone questioning her memory. When Eliza asks a question about a situation since she can't remember, the other characters confirm that it is someone she knew or a situation that had happened. Each chapter parallels each other with a similar situation for each character. THE ELIZAS was a psychological fest. Did I or didn't I do that? Did I or didn't I remember that situation? Is the character in my book really me? THE ELIZAS was a bit confusing at first and kept me guessing. Once a few things were revealed, the tension mounted and things came together, but the oddness continued.More than one story seemed to be going on at once throughout the book.Be patient and read carefully when you read THE ELIZAS. You never know who may be lurking. 4/5This book was given to me free of charge and without compensation by the publisher and NetGalley in return for an honest review."}, {"userName": "Tadiana \u2729Night Owl\u263d", "userReviewDate": "Jun 07, 2018", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/8734459-tadiana-night-owl", "userReview": "[Realizing that Eliza has some really serious mental health problems made a difference in my sympathy toward her as a character as well.

But reality and fiction collide and Eliza is unable to differentiate between her novel and her real life.Sara Shepard has a way of drawing out the characters and sympathizing with even the unlikable characters .

While overall this was an entertaining, easy read it didn\u2019t have that bite, that sharpness that I need in a \u201cgrown up\u201d thriller.There WAS plenty that worked for me here, I absolutely love books about books and this one alternated Between Eliza\u2019s POV in the present and chapters from her debut novel, The Dots. To begin I was equally invested in both narratives but as the lines between fact and fiction started to get fuzzy, I found myself more interested in Eliza\u2019s book rather than her story. I don\u2019t necessarily think that\u2019s a problem per se, but I didn\u2019t expect to feel like that nonetheless.I really think that my main issue is that I\u2019m far too seasoned in terms of reading true, gritty thrillers to be surprised by this one. This would be perfect for a YA audience or anyone who is wanting to branch out into thrillers who isn\u2019t as jaded and picky as me. It would also be ideal for anyone who is looking for a lighter suspense read with no gore or graphic details, this focuses more on paranoia and the unknown than violence. Shepherd is a solid writer and does write page turners though, I\u2019m sure the right audience will love this but unfortunately that\u2019s just not me."}, {"userName": "Abby (Crime by the Book)", "userReviewDate": "Feb 05, 2018", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/45237578-abby-crime-by-the-book", "userReview": "Full review to come! This is a lighter suspense novel that will work well for readers who typically prefer YA, but are looking to branch out into adult suspense!

That's how the story begins. Found at the bottom of a pool in a drunken stupid with a belly full of vodka is how this twisted tale begins. I found the opening to be rather frantic and oozing of panic, which was a great way to lead the story of this heavily psychological melodrama featuring a novel within a novel. Eliza Fontaine is not a likable or reliable character and that really fit well within this story for me. That being said, some things with this novel really worked for me while others were things I wasn't able to grasp. This novel is good. More psychological and overwrought than her previous work, Shepard takes a giant leap into the adult world of psychological thrillers and the result is a novel that throws so many questions at you that it's painful to not continue to read. I really loved the alternating chapters of Elizas novel \"The Dots\" and could see the correlation within the two worlds as they continue to bump into each other before a disastrous collision. While this novel is a lighter read and fun, similar to that of a Lifetime movie, my only issue that I was having a hard time grasping was the chapters from Eliza's world as she tries to piece together what happened that night. It was almost like the character did have full on amnesia and the results were not only frantic chapters, but those that left me wondering at times if I had missed a chapter or a larger portion of the novel was trying to worm its way out of the center of truth.Shepard again does a great job of wrapping everything up neatly with a bow and answering all questions the reader may have and the ending was not only shocking, but complex, and didn't let me down as a reader. I would mark this as a novel that is a great and light beach read, perfect for those who are young adult readers transitioning into the world of adult suspense or for those who want a psychological thriller that isn't too gritty or violent.Special thanks to Atria Books for this copy in exchange for my honest review."}, {"userName": "Jamie Rosenblit", "userReviewDate": "May 07, 2018", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/2364302-jamie-rosenblit", "userReview": "This just honestly did not work for me. I found myself not loving either Eliza\u2019s story or her novel, The Dots and when they finally came together, I kind of just said oh well, that\u2019s interesting, I guess. Which is never the feeling you want when getting to the twist. And then, there was another 25% left in the book. The word count definitely could have been cut down here. I am a huge fan of the PLL series and The Lying Game series, too, but sad to report this one wasn\u2019t for me. I received an advance copy.

I love the book within a book aspect and the twists and turns that keep you guessing. Reminded me in some ways of Pretty Little Liars but aimed at a slightly more mature audience. Sara is adept in writing a psychological thriller that will have you suspecting everyone. No one is safe from scrutiny in the world of Sara Shepard!I highly recommend this to long time fans and to those looking for an engaging captivating read. This is one of those books that once you start you cannot put it down. I finished in a few hours and took a few to let everything sink in before writing this review.

Like everybody else in the universe, I have heard of Sara Shepard and was very excited to pick up \nThe Elizas\n when my dear friend Tracy sent me a copy. Eliza Fontaine is an unreliable narrator (yes!) and debut novelist who was found at the bottom of the Tranquility Hotel pool and rushed to the Emergency Room. Her family is quick to pronounce the episode as a suicide attempt, but as Eliza recovers, she vehemently believes that she was pushed and wants to figure out why. Eliza becomes obsessed with finding out the person who attempted to murder her; investigating on her own accord\u2014speaking with her rescuer, her family, the hotel staff, anyone who might have a clue as to the situation in question. At the same time, her novel gains serious press due to her pool incident and becomes the upcoming buzz book to read. Eliza's publicist and publisher are both ecstatic for the launch of Eliza's debut novel, The Dots and are banking on it's success. As Eliza dives deeper into her investigation, she starts to realize that her memory loss (due to a brain tumor she had recently) has really become a serious ailment. Eliza needs to focus on her mental health and career. As Eliza's sanity begins to deteriorate, the lines of reality starts to blur. Eliza may believe that she needs to find the culprit who tried to kill her, but she also needs to figure out what is going on within herself as well before it's too late.I'm not going to sugar coat this review at all folks. If you have a copy of \nThe Elizas\n and read my blurb or the blurb provided by the publisher; read that and then skip alllllllllllllllllllllllllllllllllllllllllllllllllllllllllllllllllllllllllllllll the way to the end to find out what happens. Literally that is the entire story. \nThe Elizas\n a feeble attempt of joining the ranks of psychological thriller mavens Gillian Flynn or Ruth Ware. Maybe if the story was marketed as a drama, it could've worked better for me. At first, the story was very promising and engaging, but after a quarter of the way into the story, I was bored and ready to move on. I powered through it because the copy was sent to me by a dear friend and I wanted to make sure I gave my friend the respect in reading it, but this was tough folks. The two POVs (Eliza and then excerpts from her book The Dots) just didn't work for me, although I appreciated the reasoning behind it by the end of the novel. I do think this story will have a niche market to invest in (e.g.: I'm sending my sister this book, because I know she'd love it), but it's definitely not for everybody. I could slam and roast this book all day long, but I'm just going to keep my review short and to the point (I've decided to be nicer in 2018 #NewYearsResolutions). If you end up enjoying this one, please tell me why! I'd love to have a discussion about it."}, {"userName": "Andie ", "userReviewDate": "Apr 08, 2018", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/30510075-andie", "userReview": "3.5 starsHaving been a fan of the Pretty Little Liars series, I was really excited to jump into the authors newest standalone suspense novel. Eliza is truly an unreliable narrator and wasn't exactly my cup of tea, but I still managed to really enjoy the story once the plot thickened! The constant questioning of what's reality and what is simply in Eliza's head is what drove me to continuously think about the book once I had set it aside for the night. While the jumping back and forth between the present and Eliza's novel irritated me in the beginning, by mid-way I couldn't decide which version I liked more and thoroughly enjoyed the story as a whole. Though I can't say I am completely satisfied after finishing this book, I do appreciate the obstacles taken to get there - I truly couldn't figure this one out and especially loved the curveball there at the end.

I was actually almost irritated by it at first but as it became clear why it was being incorporated, it began to make more sense and I was almost looking forward to The Dots more than The Elizas... but then... wait for it.... You'll have to read it to figure it all out. It can be a bit confusing at first and it certainly was for me at various times. However, it comes together quite nicely towards the end. I did feel like it got stretched out just a little bit more than necessary but I was definitely concentrated on Eliza's character. I felt just as confused as she was and I was getting just as irritated and frustrated as she was as well! Good lord - with friends and family like that, who needs enemies?

Eliza can't swim, and her family assumes this was yet another one of Eliza's failed suicide attempts, as she has a history of winding up at the bottom of swimming pools. But Eliza swears this time was different; yes, she was drinking that evening, but she's sure someone pushed her, even if she can't remember exactly how she wound up at the pool or even the hotel bar. The sole witness is the man who rescued her, so Eliza tracks him down. But as they attempt to figure out what happened, Eliza only grows more confused. She's about to get her first novel published, and it seems as if events from the novel are intertwining with her life. She thought her novel was fiction, but now she's bewildered, feeling followed, and wondering if she's finally losing her mind for good. This was an odd little book and not at all what I was expecting. That's not necessarily a bad thing, though, and the more I think about it, the more I should have realized that Sara Shepard is quite masterful at playing with our minds. This is actually almost two books in one: we get the novel itself; as well excerpts from The Dots, Eliza's debut novel, which is set to be published a few weeks after she's found in the pool. As we get deeper and deeper into The Dots, we're left to wonder how much its protagonist, Dot, is like Eliza--where does Eliza end and Dot begin? It's really quite an ingenious setup and it's quite fun. I actually really liked the excerpts more at times. The novel revolves around the confusing question of identity, as Eliza struggles to figure out who she is and what she remembers about her life and past. My only struggle was that Eliza does a lot of thinking (aka talking or narrating) and I lost interest at some points when she talked on a bit. Still, most of the time, this was a pretty suspenseful book; it's certainly \"trippy\" and often confusing, as you work to puzzle out things alongside Eliza. I definitely didn't have everything figured out immediately, though I worked most things out as I went along. Overall, this is a quick read (I read the entire thing during during two consecutive plane rides), and the book-within-a-book setup is fun and adds to the suspense. This isn't a read for those who love intricate, deeply plotted thrillers, but it's enjoyable and compelling and perfect for YA fans looking for a psychological thriller. 3.5 stars.

But then, you know what they say, are you really paranoid if it\u2019s true?My TakeThis is a horrible story. Horrible and yet good. I\u2019d give it a \u201c5\u201d, except I hate the protagonist. And that isn\u2019t really fair. But I gotta say I struggled through the first 60-some percent of the story, as Eliza was so offputting. I wanted to strangle her myself.AND, I\u2019m glad I persisted, if only to discover the truth. I suspected a part of it. It was too obvious not to. But that sudden flip at the end\u2026hoo-boy. Actually I should say the several flips. It\u2019s hard to say who I felt was the more guilty by then.Shepard did an excellent job of conveying Eliza\u2019s fears and paranoia. I was feeling it and jumping at every sound, twitching at every shadow. Unfortunately, Eliza\u2019s personality only made me want to off the bitch. I cheered on the drowning (Shepard certainly conveyed her bliss at drowning), if only to put me out of my misery, let alone her family's. Of course, Eliza did everything she could to sabotage herself.My god, she was a self-centered, snotty, little sociopath! Psychopath?? Hard to tell, as she appeared to be this way from childhood \u2014 strangling Barbies, hanging teddy bears with mini suicide notes\u2026 Everything revolved around her. The nasty stuff she pulled on her stepsister when they were children! The way she treated people, wanting to hurt them to cover up her own sense of shame. What? She\u2019s never heard of automatic bill pay? That obsession she had with death! It makes me wonder if her family did as they do more for their own welfare than for hers. I\u2019m sure they felt more empathy for her than I did, even if they were so incredibly cruel.\"But sometimes lying\u2019s my natural response.\u201d\"I needed her to fear me.\u201d\"I make a list of people who might hate me \u2026 people from the writing group \u2026 whose fiction I critiqued the teensiest bit too harshly \u2026\u201d\"People without style have always fascinated me. Is it that they don\u2019t care?\u201d \u2026 Could she not have gotten cuter glasses?\"The ultimate reveal of that shadow haunting Eliza\u2019s every step was satisfying, BUT I didn\u2019t buy the reality of it. And I can\u2019t say more without spoiling it.Getting into the technical aspect, Shepard uses present tense with a first person protagonist point-of-view from Eliza\u2019s perspective. It\u2019s ideal as it is all about Eliza, a very unreliable narrator, and her thoughts with a good bit of foreshadowing.The StoryWhen debut novelist Eliza Fontaine is found at the bottom of a hotel pool, her family at first assumes that it\u2019s just another failed suicide attempt. But Eliza swears she was pushed, and her rescuer is the only witness.Desperate to find out who attacked her, Eliza takes it upon herself to investigate. But as the publication date for her novel draws closer, Eliza finds more questions than answers. Like why are her editor, agent, and family mixing up events from her novel with events from her life? Her novel is completely fictional \u2014 isn\u2019t it?The deeper Eliza goes into her investigation while struggling with memory loss, the closer her life starts to resemble her novel, until the line between reality and fiction starts to blur and she can no longer tell where her protagonist\u2019s life ends and hers begins\u2026The CharactersTwenty-three-year-old Eliza Fontaine has written a book, \nThe Dots\n, that has terrific promise.

Who here has read the PRETTY LITTLE LIARS series? Unfortunately I'm not part of that group (I know, I know, I'll eventually get to them!) but Sara Shepard's new standalone sounded very intriguing! THE ELIZAS is a lighter thriller read and perfect for those that want to transition into the thriller genre.This is one of those that all readers love - a book within a book and a book about an author! Eliza Fontaine is a debut novelist and she is found at the bottom of the pool of her hotel. It appears to be a failed suicide attempt, but she is insistent that she was pushed.She is determined to find out who her attacker is, but with slight memory loss it is proving harder than she ever imagined. With the lines between her life and her upcoming novel beginning to blur, how do we know what is fiction and what is the truth?Without going into too much more detail, I'm going to say that this is a great unreliable narrator story! Who doesn't love not knowing if you can trust everything your narrator is telling you? It keeps the suspense up and it had me flipping the pages to see what would happen next. Like I previously mentioned, this is on the lighter side of the thriller genre, so don't go into it thinking you'll get a gruesome investigation and crazy twists.I really enjoyed the writing and will be bumping up the PRETTY LITTLE LIARS series in my TBR.

Her family believes it's another failed suicide attempt, but Eliza feels certain she was pushed. Of course, no one believes her and she is determined to find the person who tried to kill her and find out why. THE ELIZAS is such a thrilling creepy ride so hang on tight. This story was a little confusing to me at first but once I settled down, I was totally invested in Eliza's story and was hoping she could figure out what really happened.Eliza tracks down the only witness, the man who rescued her from the bottom of the pool. After talking with him she is even more confused than ever but is determined to figure out what happened and who did this to her. Why would someone want her dead? At the same time, she is getting ready to publish her first novel and soon it feels like her life becomes the story she wrote. THE ELIZAS has everyone, including Eliza herself, wondering if she is finally losing her mind for good. Sara Shepard really plays with the reader's mind and will have them questioning what is truth and what is fiction.THE ELIZAS jumps back and forth between the present and Eliza's novel. Pay attention, be patient and read on. Sara Shepard continues to throw the reader curve balls and keeps them guessing right up until the end of the story. Will Eliza ever be able to untangle the web of lies to finally figure out who tried to kill her? How does her upcoming novel, The Dots, a story she wrote after she had surgery for a brain tumor, fit in to what has happened at the pool that night, or does it? Just when the reader has it all figured out, the twists and turns take them into a different direction and leaves them scratching their heads. That is exactly what happened to me.

I then went on to read everything she had ever written and recently I got to meet her when I attended the RT2017 in Atlanta. She was amazing. So when I saw on Netgalley, a new release by her - I just had to read it. The Elizas is written with more the New Adult-Adult audience in mind and like her other series has a psychological twist to the story. In The Elizas, we meet Eliza Fontaine who is now being seen as trying to kill herself by her family and friends, but she knows different - she was pushed into the pool that fateful night. Now Eliza must try and untangle the web of lies and deception to find out what happened that night at the hotel. In The Elizas, we are also given a bit of an Inception twist with it being a Book within a Book. Eliza Fontaine is also an upcoming bestselling author of a book called Dots. It was created after she had surgery for her brain tumor. I have to admit, in some parts, I was like I could see this coming, and in others, it was like just when you were certain it was something - bam - out comes another twist and turn in the story. The Elizas by Sara Shepard keeps readers on their toes as they try to get to the bottom of what happened with Eliza at the hotel and what secrets her friends and family are all hiding.

When the pitch came through I wasn\u2019t entirely sure this was something that I was interested in reading.....but yet I read it. Maybe it was the colorful cover or maybe it was the idea of a false memory. I don\u2019t know but something made me think this was something that I would be interested in.Sara Shepard wrote the wildly popular Pretty Little Liars series so maybe that was what made me excited. I mean her books are popular right? She must be doing something right, so I agreed to read.This is Shepard\u2019s first adult novel so obviously the stakes are high when you come from writing YA and try to break into adult literature. I was curious to see how that played out for Shepard so here we are. So if this book was meant to be a suspense novel, I would say that Shepard nailed it if it was meant to be a psychological thriller I would say it was good but not great. I hate when a book lands in the middle.So what did I like? I liked that this novel kept me guessing at first. Could it be confusing at times? Yes, but on the whole I was more intrigued than confused\u2026.at least in the beginning. I mean it was all kinds of odd\u2026.not odd like I have no idea whats happening, but more odd like I know something is fishy but I\u2019m not sure what. I liked that a lot. I thought there were some psychological elements in the story that were meant to have a greater impact on the story and add more of a darker thriller feel but I wasn\u2019t sure that that came through strongly enough to completely move it out of suspense and firmly into thriller.Eliza is clearly an unreliably narrator which I love, but sometimes I felt that what was reality and what was in her mind was a little too busy and could be confusing as the story went on. While I love an unreliable narrator, sometimes it\u2019s difficult to execute. I wouldn\u2019t say that Shepard\u2019s attempt failed by any means, but I jut think sometimes it got to be a little much. Less is more. There were a few times where I felt like I needed to just put the book down and come back to it later. It wasn\u2019t so much that I wanted to put the book down completely, more like I just needed a break from time to time.So I think the idea of this novel was for it to be a darker more adult thriller. I would say this is on the lighter side of thriller. It lacks the complexity that some of the more serious thrillers have, but for someone who is new to the genre and it\u2019s not really their \u2018thing\u2019 or for younger readers transitioning to more adult novels\u2026.this is probably a good place to start. For die hard thriller fans, this is probably not going to be the book you were hoping.Overall it was ok for me. I am not a \u2018die hard\u2019 thriller person by any means, but at the same time I\u2019ve read enough of the darker thrillers to have an appreciation for the genre and this book would be lacking for those die hard fans of the genre.See my full review here"}, {"userName": "Elaine", "userReviewDate": "May 02, 2018", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/7948278-elaine", "userReview": "Like some readers have mentioned, I've also never read or seen Pretty Little Liars but I picked up \nThe Elizas\n because the premise sounded vaguely intriguing, though not unique. ** Spoiler-y bits ahead ** Let's start with the unlikable character of Eliza; she is whiny, bratty, and has just recently published a novel called The Dots, about a young girl named Dot and her charismatic and abusive aunt Dorothy. When Eliza is found floating in the hotel pool, her family is convinced it is a cry for help but Eliza is not suicidal: she insists someone is out to kill her. But who?And, do we care?I certainly didn't. Eliza is not interesting or fascinating; in fact, I'm surprised she can string a sentence together, much less write a book. She drinks, she admits to being unfaithful to all her boyfriends, she is a brat and petulant. She's quite a winner. Okay, she's young, but that's still no excuse for being boring.Eliza goes on a hum drum journey to find the truth, which includes contacting her rescuer, Desmond; confronting her parents, and dealing with her agent and publicist. It's all equal parts boring, tedious and monotonous.At the same time, readers are given snippets of The Dots, a common literary device that offers details about Eliza's past, clues as to who Eliza is and why she is acting the way she is.As always, the truth is less dramatic than life. Eliza discovers a conspiracy concocted by her parents to protect her from a troubled childhood and the abuse she suffered at the hands of her aunt. Ever notice that when your parents want to help you, especially in a book, it always goes disastrously wrong?The quack they hired to perform this unorthodox procedure was not successful and those suppressed memories manifested themselves into the book, a coping mechanism Eliza said she needed after surviving a medical procedure for a benign tumor. Naturally, the details of her book began to seep into her life, blurring the edges of her reality....blah blah blah.Okay, let's get to he ridiculous and hilarious parts of the book, like:Desmond driving a Batmobile? Is it to show he's quirky and a nerd?The lack of chemistry between Desmond and Eliza. I've said it before and I'll say it again until I'm blue in the freaking face: does every female need to couple up at the end?Eliza's mother shoving her in the alley and then running away like a purse snatcher. What???I laughed and rolled my eyes when I got to this part. The author expects me to believe this? Come on! Try a little harder, really! That's your job!In the end, Eliza is not crazy.

It is a pretty solid young adult thriller. Being quite a huge fan of suspenseful mysteries\u2014particularly any type with unreliable or biased narrators\u2014this caught my attention immediately. I am much more used to reading adult psychological thrillers, and this is not quite on par with the plot structure and intensity of many of those. As it is a young adult novel, it is a bit less complex and much lighter, so it\u2019s important to note that going in. However, The Elizas is an entertaining and heart-pounding story that is sure to hook its intended audience.In this novel, we follow a young woman named Eliza Fontaine, a debut novelist whose book release date is rapidly approaching. But life takes a strange turn when she is pulled from the bottom of a hotel pool. Her family believes it to be just another suicide attempt\u2014she insists it was an attempted murder. With only one person on her side, and what seems like the whole world trying to convince her she\u2019s just insane, Eliza must investigate the attack herself.However, as she struggles to regain lost memories, every avenue she explores only ends up raising even more questions. And suddenly, her novel is starting to sound less like a story and more like her life. Told in chapters that alternate between Eliza\u2019s point of view and excerpts from her book, The Dots, the parallels become undeniable, and the line between reality and fiction becomes increasingly blurry.I\u2019ll admit, it took me quite some time to fully immerse myself in this novel. The first half of Eliza\u2019s story plays out very slowly, and is often times extremely repetitive. This makes sense in the grand scheme of things, since we are primarily dealing with her attempting to regain memories she cannot seem to unlock. But I still feel that her plotline is in need of more events\u2014however small\u2014to help us become more invested in her as a character. For awhile, I found myself being much more interested in the excerpts from The Dots instead of the main storyline, though both are equally important.The narrative came across as a bit choppy to me in the beginning\u2014it feels like things are repeating and going nowhere, there is a sudden heightening of the tension, and then we are back to the same circumstances. This is obviously congruent with the situation of someone dealing with memory loss, so I completely understand the effect that Shepard is going for. However, I do wish there had been a tiny bit more added to Eliza\u2019s experiences, just to gradually pull the reader deeper into her life throughout the novel as a whole.Unreliable narrators are, by nature, inconsistent, and always add a good amount of confusion into the process of getting to know who they are, as well as what is truly going on. Eliza is especially unpredictable all the way through\u2014but at the start, her personality comes across like Shepard can\u2019t decide what to do with her instead of what might be naturally erratic for her mental state. In general, though, I do think Shepard really captures and deals with all the physical and mental health aspects of this novel clearly and believably.Even with the initial lagging of the main plotline, Shepard manages to build quite a lot of suspense in both stories. She sprinkles just enough intrigue into most of the early chapters, and I was always at least a little curious to find out what would happen next. The switching between Eliza\u2019s point of view and the excerpts from The Dots added a great deal to the tension building up as things progressed. And, despite it being a little rocky at first, I did consistently become more and more hooked.That second half though\u2014oh boy. I was absolutely riveted to every page. Every aspect of the story escalates so quickly, and even though I had predicted some of the ending, it still had me on the edge of my seat. For me, Shepard ended in the strongest way possible\u2014she made every last bit pack a punch, and threw in a few surprisingly powerful twists. Though it is not hard to guess most of what is going on and roughly how things will shake out, there are plenty of details that you most likely will not see coming. That, coupled with the strength of the overall reveal, truly enriches the novel as a whole.Shepard also does a relatively good job with her character creation. They are all very clearly described and, aside from Eliza, have static personalities the whole way through. This means that not all of the characters are very multi-dimensional, but they are still depicted well and fit very nicely into the plot. Eliza is definitely a dynamic character\u2014our view of her is constantly changing and building until everything is fully revealed in the end. And the majority of the relationships between Eliza and the others are highly realistic and comprehensible.The one element that I never got fully on board with was the romance. In the first place, it was a severe case of insta-love. When they first meet, Eliza goes from describing him like he is sort of gross and creepy to abruptly feeling incredibly turned on basically by her sudden thought of them having sex. Over the short time they initially spend together, she goes back to showing little interest in him, while he is awkwardly proclaiming his undying love for her. And voila, they are now a couple. Though their relationship was sweeter toward the end, I spent most of it trying to comprehend how it happened, while occasionally feeling mildly disturbed.I found Shepard\u2019s writing style to be fairly strong. It didn\u2019t particularly stand out or completely captivate me, but it flows well for the narrative she weaves and is very easy to read. She crafts a good mystery, following up on all the various threads to the point were I couldn\u2019t personally think of anything left completely unexplained. Shepard also writes very cinematically\u2014her descriptions are vivid, and the interactions between characters were stellar. We are able to clearly visualize everything playing out, and distinctly feel the clarity that Eliza is slowly experiencing.Overall, if this sounds good to you\u2014or if you\u2019re looking for a quick thriller\u2014I would highly recommend giving this novel a try, especially if you are a young adult reader. While, like I said, it\u2019s not going to have the intensity and depth of an adult psychological thriller, and it isn\u2019t entirely unpredictable, it really does have a lot going for it. It is gripping enough to pull a mystery fan in, and just chilling enough to make for an entertaining read. As for me, I ended up enjoying this story more than I thought I would, and I am definitely interested in reading some more of Shepard\u2019s work."}, {"userName": "Ellen at Book Bellas", "userReviewDate": "Apr 14, 2018", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/10000471-ellen-at-book-bellas", "userReview": "This is a sharp, snappy clever mystery perfect for YA fans. Debut novelist Eliza Fontaine has just been pulled from a near-drowning in a hotel swimming pool, but apparently it's not the first time. \n\u201cWhy am I in a hospital?\u201d I ask again. \u201cPlease. Somebody tell me.\u201d Bill clears his throat awkwardly. \u201cYou were found at the bottom of another pool last night.\u201d\nThere is no denying she almost drowned. But why? Eliza swears she did not try to kill herself. The police don't seem all that interested in finding out how Eliza ended up in the pool. She can't swim and she is sure that someone pushed her. The problem is that she just can't seem to remember the night very clearly and there seem to be no witnesses to what happened. Eliza is an unreliable narrator, as her family and friends are quick to point out. She's very smart and this story was loads of fun in trying to figure out who was telling the truth and who was lying. Or was it Eliza that was untruthful? This clever book is actually two books: 'The Elizas' alternates between Eliza's narration and the book she is about to publish, 'The Dots'.\n\"It\u2019s not so crazy they think I jumped. I have a bit of a track record of this kind of behavior. But I didn\u2019t go into that water willingly\u2014this I know for sure. Someone wanted me dead.\"\nI wasn't sure what was real in this book and what was a product of Eliza's very vivid imagination. The author created a cast of very real and colorful characters which added to the fun of this story. I was rooting for Eliza to find a true friend and perhaps make a real connection with someone. She enlists the help of the unusual and very unique Desmond to try and unravel the mystery of what happened to her in the Palm Springs hotel pool. \n\u201cI\u2019m smitten by you, Eliza,\u201d Desmond says. \u201cYou\u2019re like the Lady of the Lake. I don\u2019t understand a lot about you, but I\u2019d spend the rest of my life figuring you out. I want to help you however I can, including figuring out what scared you so much. I want to save you.\u201d\nI read this book in one sitting and very much enjoyed both the main story and 'The Dots'. This book is both funny, poignant and very suspenseful and will definitely appeal to fans of the YA genre who are looking for a slow-building mystery. There is a huge twist at the end that was a big surprise. While I felt that this book mostly read like a script (it would make a great movie or mini-series!), overall I really enjoyed this fun thriller and am still thinking this book even after I finished.

It alternates between Eliza, and The Dot\u2019s (which is the book she wrote) I found myself more intrigued by The Dots chapters than I did with Eliza\u2019s.

While it was good, I think it had room for improvement. I did however, like the way her writing grabs a hold of you. Whether or not I liked this book, I knew I was going to keep reading because I had to find out what was going on with all of them. I look forward to seeing what Sara writes next, and I applaud her for shedding some light on mental illnesses, and the sometimes rather unconventional ways they are treated.

You will find yourself feeling almost desperate to find out what is happening and why.But.The major flaw comes at the very end. Sooooooo much is revealed in the epilogue that it feels like Shepard didn't know how else to tie up her loose ends. You read chapter after chapter only to have it all resolved in the last one that you're left feeling almost exhausted. That cheapens the book for me. Epilogues are intended to give you a little post-plot insight. In this case, the epilogue is so integral to the book that I'm left wondering why Shepard didn't just include it in the body of the story. Even then, though, she puts a LOT of plot in that last chapter. A LOT.I'm curious as to what you think of this, so if you read it, please come back, hit up the comments, and let me know.
