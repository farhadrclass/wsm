It seemed like the author did a rush job. The parents portrayed in the Old Yeller book would not have put up with the attitude and disrespect Arliss showed adults. The whole horse catching thing was just too easy. Nothing dealing with an animal is that easy, esp. a wild stud horse. He would have been savy to those types of tricks. Then I don't get why Arliss kept blacking out unless he head butted the horse in the middle of the wild ride. I think if he had taken his time and thought it out, put in more detail, the book could have been awesome. A week of chasing a wild horse - etc."}, {"userName": "Zane", "userReviewDate": "Aug 09, 2017", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/52666445-zane", "userReview": "I've always been rather conflicted about the character of Arliss and throughout the two previous books have never quite been able to make up my mind about him. On the one hand, he has a lot of characteristics that I admire making up the core of his personality, so on that front I am inclined to like him. However, I do not like most of the things which he does, so I've always settled for saying that I \"don't like him much\".Well that changed in this book. I still don't stand by all the things he does, but now that I can identify with him as a character, I sure do like him a lot more."}, {"userName": "Frances", "userReviewDate": "Jun 03, 2018", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/787072-frances", "userReview": "I loved Old Yeller and read it many times. I still have my $.60 copy from 1967. This is about Arliss who was cute when he was 5 but is annoying at 12. Throwing rocks at people at age 12 is not acceptable and Papa needed to wear him out. Not as good as Old Yeller."}, {"userName": "Tracy K", "userReviewDate": "Feb 18, 2017", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/33920509-tracy-k", "userReview": "I read this with my 9 year old son who identified with Arliss' frustration at always being told he was too little to do anything. It's a short, entertaining read. I have to admit there were a few times I was a little apprehensive reading about Arliss' bad behavior with my son, but he was able to recognize it for what it was - a story about an unruly boy who gets in trouble, usually gets his the punishment he deserves, and for once, got to prove he wasn't all that little. Arliss is unruly. Arliss is outrageous. Arliss is funny. We laughed out loud and are still sharing secret Arliss jokes. My son couldn't wait to read each day and read a lot of this book to me. That makes it a winner in this house. We ended up really bonding over this book. We borrowed from the library, and I'm sorry it's so hard to find copies because it's one I'd really like him to have for keeps."}, {"userName": "Molly Cline", "userReviewDate": "Sep 13, 2016", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/41810802-molly-cline", "userReview": "3 starThis is book 3 and the last (that I know of) of the Old Yeller series. This book was nice, filled with adventure similar to the other two.

Arliss is VERY HYPER in this book, talking back to his parents and getting into trouble. Things I normally don't enjoy reading about.
