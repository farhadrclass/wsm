Forever My Girl  is a beautiful YA rockstar romance about the heartbreak of mistakes, the power of forgiveness, and the hope of a second chance at love. I\u2019ll be perfectly honest, when I first read the blurb for this book, I squeed right out loud. I mean, a second-chance rockstar romance? What\u2019s not to love?Here\u2019s the blurb, I\u2019ll let you fall in love with it all on your own:  I was never supposed to be a rock star. I had my life all planned out for me. Play football in college. Go to the NFL. Marry my high school sweetheart and live happily ever after.I broke both our hearts that day when I told her I was leaving. I was young. I made the right decision for me, but the wrong decision for us. I\u2019ve poured my soul into my music, but I\u2019ve never forgotten her. Her smell, her smile.And now I\u2019m going back.After ten years.I hope I can explain that after all this time.I still want her to be my forever girl.  See?? *clutches heart* Now you can understand why I just HAD to read it! \u201cI gave up on their dreams and the life we had all planned out. And now I was heading home to face the music.\u201d By the time I was 3% into my read, I was already choked up. There was just so much emotion! There is a tragedy that occurs back in Liam's home town, a death of a close friend, and I just have to give serious props to the author for making me utterly heartbroken over a character I had never even met! I totally felt the hole that his loss had left in his loved ones\u2019 lives. It really helped connect me very early on in the book to the characters and draw me right into the story.With Liam now being the tattooed, motorcycle riding, bad boy, rockstar that he was, I wanted to know what made him originally decide to leave his forever girl behind and never look back? He was clearly still 100% in love with her after all these years and never forgot her or was able to let go, so what could have pushed him to leave?Despite the fact that I could fathom why he\u2019d have left in the first place, I really respected that he didn\u2019t just thunder back, demanding to be back in Josie\u2019s life. I loved how understanding he was of her new life despite still being completely in love with her.With Josie, I wanted to see how she\u2019d react to him. She was put in such a difficult situation of not knowing why the love of her life walked away with no warning and completely cut off ties from her and was then faced with the reality of him not returning and was left to move on without him.  \u201cHey, Jojo?\u201d he yells.\u201cYeah,\u201d I yell back. \u201cI\u2019m going to marry you someday.\u201d  I thought for sure we\u2019d spend forever together. I thought our love was one of a kind. I would almost be okay if he had met someone else and fallen in love, but he didn\u2019t. He just left.\u201d I loved seeing the way she dealt with his return. I loved how she didn\u2019t just fall over him the second he walked back into her life \u2013 that she made him earn his forgiveness and his place back in her life. I felt like her struggles were real and relatable\u2026 and there are other pieces to this story that I don\u2019t want to mention because they are slight spoilers but I really felt for everyone involved and for their struggles at figuring out how how to move forward.I liked that none of the characters were fully perfect and that given the huge mistakes of the past, I liked that their lives didn\u2019t just magically fall back into place. The rekindling of their relationship was never rushed making the story feel a lot more real.  \u201cHer tear streaked face is beautiful. I want to wipe away her tears. I want to take the last ten years and erase them.\u201d  I enjoyed the writing style. The story was told in alternating POVs with flashbacks here and there. The transition between POVs was smooth and the flashbacks were very well integrated. Seeing both sides of the story helped connect me to both main characters and given the complicated situation they were in, it was really well done. And the story just had these few lines here and there that just hit you right in the feels. Total heart clutch moments! I didn\u2019t ever cry but I got all chocked up more than once!  \u201cI want every part of you in my life, Jojo, when you\u2019re ready.\u201d \u201cI\u2019ll be patient\u2026 You will be mine again.\u201d  I read the whole book in one sitting (about 3 hours). I didn\u2019t want to put it down and it was one of those book where the pages just flew by.The genre kind of rides the line between YA and NA. There is one sex scene towards the end. Its not closed door, but not very graphic either. There are, however, a few beautiful kisses scattered throughout the book and, if you read the story, you'll see that an earlier bedroom scene wouldn\u2019t have really made sense anyways.We\u2019re also introduced to a wonderful network of friends, family and band members each with their own heartaches and stories that I\u2019m sure will be featured in the upcoming books.The story is wrapped up in a happy ending. I did feel it was just a tad rushed, but at the same time, everything that needed to happen for your heart to rest easy happened, so you are left satisfied.  \u201cI love you, Liam.\u201d\u201cYou\u2019re forever my girl.\u201d  This book had so many things I love in it \u2013 an emotional second-chance love story, a bad boy rockstar, a smart heroine, a strong ensemble of supporting characters, and a wonderful story.It was a great debut novel! I\u2019m definitely a new fan of Heidi McLaughlin and am looking forward to the next book in this series.CASTING:For more of my reviews, visit Aestas Book BlogAnd come join the Aestas Book Blog  Facebook Page"}, {"userName": "Dija", "userReviewDate": "Jan 11, 2013", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/2857113-dija", "userReview": "Dropped at: 51%Reason: None of the characters act their age (the adults act like immature teeangers and the kids like wise grandparents), the dialogue is contrived, Josie's mood swings are beyond annoying, and Liam is a drama queen.

I hate me.I ruined her life. That is what her voice message said. The one I've saved for the past ten years. The one I've transferred from phone to phone just so I could hear her voice when I\u2019m at my lowest. I can recite every hateful word she said to me when I was too busy to answer and never found the time to call her back. Never found one second to call and explain to her what I had done to us. She was my best friend and I let her slip through my fingers just to save myself from the heartache of hearing she didn't want me anymore.I had dreams too.And my dreams included her, but she would never have gone for it.

Can love heal old wounds that have been inflicted by the one that broke your heart? Forever My Girl by Heidi McLaughlin is a story about second chances and redemption. About how love can stand the test of time. It's sad, sweet and heartwarming. Leaving you with a feeling of hope that no matter what will happen, LOVE can conquer all. (YES, I am forever an optimist; the idea of love makes me all gushy. ;))\n\u201cWhen you love someone, you just know.\" \nLiam is living the Hollywood lifestyle. He's a huge rock star who has everything he could ever want and need at his fingertips. It turns out that Liam's life is anything but a fairy-tale, he's extremely lonely and suffering from a bad decision he made ten years earlier. Liam destroyed the most important relationship that he\u2019s had with the only girl he's ever loved. He torments himself daily with thoughts of whether the choice to live his dreams was worth the sacrifice of leaving his family, friends and one true love behind. When confronted with the sudden death of his best friend Mason, he decides to go home and pay his respects. The need to see Josie his former love one more time is inescapable. He wants to convince himself that he made the best decision by leaving her behind.\n\u201cI thought for sure we'd spend forever together. I thought our love was one of a kind. I would almost be okay if he had met someone else and fallen in love, but he didn't. He just left. He said he was suffocating.\u201d ~~ Josie \nJosie is trying to move on from the past. They say time heals old wounds but Josie has never been able to fully recover from the shattered heart that Liam left her with. Working as a florist in a flower shop that she also owns, Josie is raising her son Noah with Nick her boyfriend of six years. Sad and dealing with the grief from the death of Mason her long time friend and best friends\u2019 husband, Josie is trying to keep it all together, that is until Liam shows up. Liam\u2019s return brings old feelings to the surface that Josie thought she had buried a long time ago and a situation Liam didn't know anything about brings them back together in a whole new way.Their first encounter with each other after ten years apart is emotional and moving. The chemistry is palpable and you want them to work through all the hurt and scars that the time apart has created. I loved their story and the way it was written. It gives you hope and leaves a smile on your face until the very end. \nI look into his eyes, his forehead rests upon mine. His mouth drops open when my fingers trail down his body, pushing him deeper.\"You're so perfect,\" he kisses me in between the words, showing me how much he loves me.\"I love you, Liam\"\"You're forever my girl.\" \nLiam and Josie are both incredibly lovable characters. I felt throughout the book they tugged on my heartstrings, making my heart melt. They weren't the only characters that caught my attention though. Katelyn, Josie's best friend, was amazing. Facing the death of anyone is tough but she lost her husband that she shared two children with. I loved the way her friends rallied around her and took care of her. Overall this is a great book if you are looking for something a bit more emotional. Heidi does an amazing job taking you through the trials of death, broken hearts, and the hope of a second chance at love. I adored it and would highly recommend picking up this great read."}, {"userName": "Kelly (and the Book Boar)", "userReviewDate": "Jan 22, 2018", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/11183856-kelly-and-the-book-boar", "userReview": "Find all of my reviews at: http://52bookminimum.blogspot.com/Yep, I gobbled this up in like twenty-three seconds.

This story broke my heart, made me laugh, made me cry, made me smile, and, when it was over, sigh with happiness. This is a highly impressive debut novel by Heidi McLaughlin.When Liam left ten years ago to pursue his dreams to become a musician, he left everyone behind, including the love of his life, without an explanation. Liam and Josie were high school sweethearts. They had their whole lives planned out together. But, of course, those plans fell through when Liam left. Liam eventually became a super rock star and Josie stayed behind in a small town with a broken heart. She tried, time and again, to reach Liam until he changed his number, which left Josie no choice but to move on with her life. Ten years later Liam reads in a newspaper that his best friend from high school has been killed in a car accident. He decides to go back home to pay his respects to his friend. He knows when he goes home he will see her. Josie. The girl he left behind and the girl he never got over. Over the years, he's never had a serious relationship. In his mind, Josie has always been his girl \u2013 the one and only girl for him. He knows there is a good chance she's married with children, but he can't leave without seeing her just once. Josie has tried to move on from Liam. In her mind she has, but her heart says another thing. Every day has been a struggle without Liam in her life. But she did eventually find love again. Not the kind of love she had with Liam, though. She's now engaged to be married, raising her son, and owns a florists shop. However, when Liam finds out what he really left behind, it was more than he could've ever imagined. And when they finally come face to face, that moment is intense. Liam knows he has a lot to atone for. Will Josie let him back into her life again? \nI told her I'd love her forever. I said I love you first and promised to never let her go. \nLiam is an incredibly sexy, cool, and caring hero. Before he left, he was known as the golden boy football player. Now he is known as the hot rock star with tattoos who rides a Ducati. He's the epitome of sexy bad boys that will make your panties disintegrate. Yet underneath the bad boy persona, he's a good man with a huge heart. He wants to make amends and accept responsibility for what he\u2019s missed out on for the last ten years. He\u2019s also determined to make Josie his girl again.Josie is a very smart and strong heroine. I admired her strength. I admired the way she handled the situation with Liam. She didn't immediately rush into his arms as much as she wanted to. (Or as much as I wanted her too.) She put her family first. And as angry and hurt as she was, she still didn't play the blame game with Liam. But having Liam back is difficult. Liam may no longer be the boy she once knew, but she still fiercely loves the changed man. She battles with her desire to be with Liam, and her will power to keep things platonic between them. This battle rages within her throughout most of the book, as they spend more and more time together. \nI never thought I'd see the boy who stole my heart and failed to give it back. I'm not sure I want it back.\nMy heart went out to Liam and Josie. I felt their pain, anger, frustration, and loss. This story grabbed me on the first page, where I immediately began shedding tears due to the tragic death of Liam and Josie\u2019s friend that affected these people deeply. What truly touched my heart and soul were the glimpses of them in the past, when these two fell in love as teenagers. Witnessing the history and love they share between them was powerful. I completely understood the force of nature that drew them towards one another when they finally see each other again. The chemistry was explosive. The logical part of me wanted Josie and Liam to make good choices, while the impulsive part of me wanted them to rip each other's clothes off. The author definitely made us wait to see what happens with these two. But don't worry, it's a sweet and happy ending. I am, however, leaving out a very important part of the story. But you will have to read the story to find out what the surprise twist is. I loved this story and the characters. To say I'm itching to see what happens with the other characters is an understatement. I cannot wait for the next book!Rating: A- (4.5 stars)Stephen Amell as Liam.

Ugh! Hate when that happens. With that being said...I liked the concept of the story. Helllooo...guy leaves girl, guy realizes his mistake and tries to win her back while she has secret from said guy...I've read plenty of those and wanted to see how this author would take a spin on this played out \"theme\". I'm a sucker for these kind of stories.Let's just get this out of the way. The main guy Liam is a CHUMP. I could not stand him. He worked my last nerve. I get that you didn't want to be a superstar football player. I get that you wanted to leave and start what you really wanted to do. What I don't get is that he left without a word to his \"Forever My Girl\" JoJo. I don't get why you want back JoJo when you had no problems not being with her for so many years. I didn't feel sorry for him. Like I said, he's a chump.JoJo, I wanted more backbone with her. She forgave easily. She kept a secret from him and I would have done the same thing. I'd be like you had no problem not being with me for 10 years, then you should have no problem without being with the secret. I mean like that.What saved the story for me was Mason. Gah! He sounded like a fantastic guy. I felt his story more than Liam and JoJo.Final thoughts...the ending felt rushed. Looking forward to Katelyn and Harrison's story cause you know they have to get together.*I really hope the author doesn't make Mason turn out to be a douche...like he had a mistress or secret love child.

I love books that do that to me. This was such a feel good contemporary romance. It was a little predictable and standard, but I think that's ok, because it was gorgeous! I do have one issue, and that is Liam's reason for leaving his home town of Beaumont and the love of his life, Josie Preston... I can see where the author was trying to go with that but it was the only weak point in the story for me. \n\nThe last thing Betty says to me that day is something I will never forget. \"Follow only your dreams, Liam.\"\n\nHowever, moving that aside and putting it in a box...I knew I was going to love it when I couldn't put it down and I was sobbing my heart out just a few chapters in. Liam and Josie's close friend, Mason, dies before the story begins, so the reader never meets him, but my God did his death make me cry like a baby. The effect Mason had on his hometown and the people he left behind is profound and a very clever way to draw you in to the book instantly!The other thing that had me gripped was the alternate POV. I love reading both sides of the story. The male POV always fascinates me slightly more, but alternating from chapter to chapter was a brilliant way to keep me turning the pages. I wanted to find out what was going on inside each of their heads and I ended up finishing the whole book in one go, finally turning my light out in the early hours of the morning. Every time I tried to retire to bed, I'd end a chapter and think 'Oh, I just want to see what Josie/Liam felt about that scene, I'll read one more chapter'... and we all know how that ends. At the end, of course! But I love a book that can do that to me. So what can I tell you about the characters?God, I felt so sorry for Josie. She did nothing wrong yet she was catapulted into this awful situation where there seemed to be no easy answer and no way to keep everybody happy. I felt for Nick. I felt for Noah... and obviously I felt for Liam. Josie, in my opinion, did everything right. She was both strong and vulnerable at the same time, a devoted mother but a woman with emotions and deep routed desires.\n\n\u201cI only have eyes for one woman, period \u2026 When I saw you, I knew I had made a mistake. I should have never left or at least come back for you. My life is better with you in it, Josie. I\u2019m not going to do anything to jeopardize that.\u201d \n\nThe surrounding characters were brilliant. I can see how there will be more great books in this series and I can't wait to read those!And then we are left with Liam! *heart flutters* Aaaaw, I heart Liam lots and lots! He is just perfect. A bad boy, tattooed rock star with a burning desire to step into his 'Daddy' shoes and spend his life proving his love to 'his girl' and his recently discovered son! He is clearly completely infatuated with Josie from the very beginning. I love this. There is nothing sexier than a man that can admit utter devotion to the woman of his dreams. And play guitar! Bonus!\n\nNever will I or have I told fans that I love them, even with something as innocent as this. I've only loved one person in my life and those words are saved for my girl and now my son.\n\nThis wasn't particularly steamy. There was a nice dose of chemistry between the characters, some naughty stolen kisses, a lot of building passion and plenty of intense desires voiced internally in each of Josie and Liam's respective monologues. There is one fairly heated sex scene toward the end but nothing graphic.There were some adorable flash backs which really helped set the scene for Josie and Liam's relationship history. You can't help but crave their reunion! \n\n\"I promise you, I'm done running. I'm still selfish, but only where you and Noah are concerned. I have years of spoiling to make up for and I plan to spend every day of my life making sure you both know how much I love you.\"\n\nIn conclusion, this book comes highly recommended by Yours Truly!

Liam left town and walked out on the girl he loved ten years previous to pursue a music career and never didn\u2019t look back. Or did he?Liam appears to have it all. Fame, fortune, women\u2026\u2026\u2026pretty much any woman he wants , except the one he still thinks about every day \u2013 the woman who truly stole his heart ten years ago.Liam lives quite the nomadic lifestyle, touring and living out of a suitcase and never putting down roots. He doesn\u2019t seem to belong.Liam is pulled back to his hometown of Beaumont after a tragic event and prepares himself to once again meet up with the girl whose heart he broke all those years ago and who still owns a large piece of his heart to this day.Josephine Preston had to move on. She was forced to pick up the pieces and build a new life for herself after Liam\u2019s departure and has found happiness living in Beaumont with Nick.When Liam comes back to Beaumont and once again comes face to face with Josie he is not quite prepared for the effect she will have on him after all this time. Josie is knocked for six seeing Liam again especially when seeing him makes her question everything that happened the day he left and every day that she has spent without him since.Josie is confused and questions everything about her life since the day Liam left her and broke her heart. Does she still have feelings for Liam? And if so should those feelings be left buried deep where they belong? The day he left he completely devastated her heart. Can she forgive?\u201cI thought for sure we\u2019d spend forever together. I thought our love was one of a kind. I would almost be okay if he had met someone else and fallen in love, but he didn\u2019t. He just left. He said he was suffocating.\u201d There is something that pulls these two together. They shared a love that was so deep, so passionate and so engulfing that really, could either of them just move on and forget about the other totally? I\u2019m not so sure they could.Forever My Girl came as a complete surprise to me. I wasn\u2019t sure what to expect but the synopsis had definitely piqued my interest.Heidi McLaughlin is a new author and Forever My Girl is her first book in the Beaumont Series and let me tell you, I will be lining up for book two.Forever My Girl is told from alternating POV\u2019s through the voices of Liam and Josie. I love dual POV\u2019s and this is told in such a way that it allows the reader the chance to get close to the characters and really feel their story. We get to hear from two different voices and each brings so much to the story that you really do connect with them in every way.I adored watching Josie and Liam\u2019s second chance love develop and I was so enamored by them. As much as I loved this relationship, it was the bonding and flourishing relationship with Noah and Liam that also captured my heart.I loved everything about this story. There only one scene I would have liked explored a little more but the fact it wasn\u2019t in no way detracted from the story. It was a scene with Nick that I would have liked to have \u201cfelt\u201d rather than \u201cread\u201d.I love second chance love stories. I love friend to lover\u2019s stories, I love books with beautiful characters, I love books about deep friendships and I love rock star stories and Forever My Girl had it all for me. It was at times sweet, at times emotional, at times funny, always endearing and the chemistry between Liam and Josie could be felt in every word .If you want to read a book that is all heart \u2013 full of characters you will instantly connect with and love from the first page to the last then Forever My Girl is the book for you.A beautiful read that I devoured and loved from start to finish."}, {"userName": "XxTainaxX", "userReviewDate": "Jan 28, 2018", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/19719801-xxtainaxx", "userReview": "Most of us know that there\u2019s a movie out based on this novel and as an avid reader, I just had to read the book before seeing the movie to be able to compare and contrast. Liam and Josie\u2019s story is one of second chances, enduring love, and learning how to fit together after years apart and secrets revealed. I don\u2019t want to get too deep into the plot so that those yet untainted by the movie trailer and reviews with spoilers can still enjoy, but I will say that I really liked this book. The pacing seemed just right for what the characters had to work through, the prose and characterization were also strong. Secondary characters were used well to propel forward using conflict.Though I felt some connection between the heroes, there was something missing for me there. I wonder if it\u2019s the history and proximity or new circumstances that made them fall in love again because it didn\u2019t stop them from moving forward with their lives in certain ways before. All in all, I\u2019m looking forward to watching the movie, even if there are some major differences evident from the trailer lol Safety: There were others for both during the separation. One of them is in a relationship.

Josie is engaged to Nick and raising Noah. Josie\u2019s feelings for Liam range from anger and love while poor Nick gets the shaft.

I wasn\u2019t impressed at all about a boy who left all the plans he made with the love of his life to pursue something that never entered his vocabulary when he and she were together. If Liam would have tried harder to explain to Josie what he wanted and needed she would have understood and stuck by him and help him follow his dreams. But instead he took the cowards way out. Not attractive at all if you ask me.I\u2019m honestly surprised at how a person can be left behind like the way Josie was and yet when the boy who broke her heart to tiny little pieces comes back into the picture and she becomes nothing but a blubbering mess. Yes Liam was the love of her life and they planned the perfect American dream. 2.5 kids and house with a white picket fence and they would live happily ever after. Not in this case. I get it, Liam wanted to live his life to the fullest. Have no regrets. Except he regrets it all. So what was the whole damn purpose of all of it? I\u2019m still trying to figure it out and I don\u2019t get it. It doesn\u2019t make a lick of sense! Liam was this great guy who wanted to prove that Josie was worthy of so much more but when it came down to it he was just as shitty as his parents. All I got from him was how selfish and arrogant he is and just cuz he\u2019s a hot shot rock star he should get whatever and whoever he wants. I had a hard time liking any of the characters. Liam and Josie for obvious reasons but Nick too. He might have been just a victim in all this but he was shady from the beginning. His antics even in the flash backs were kinda creepy. I honestly wanted the one character that couldn\u2019t come back. Mason seemed like this awesome person that we got to know after the fact.

I didn't like so much how he would confuse her about her feelings while she was still in a relationship with her Fiance Nick. Which is why, I am so glad that Josie didn't just fall at his feet with love, but instead it happened slowly. Liam was overall a great guy, but he was a total idiot as young man and still kind of was in the present. He would let others influence his decisions. It happened when he left, and again with his PR lady Sam. \n\u25cf\u00a0\u00a0\u25cf\u00a0\u00a0\u25cf\u00a0\u00a0\u25cf\u00a0\u00a0\u25cf\u00a0\u00a0\u25cf\u00a0\u00a0\u25cf\u00a0\u00a0\u25cf\u00a0\u00a0\u25cf\u00a0\u00a0\u25cf\u00a0\u00a0\u25cf\u00a0\u00a0\u25cf\u00a0\u00a0\u25cf\u00a0\u00a0\u25cf\u00a0\u00a0\u25cf\u00a0\u00a0\u25cf\u00a0\u00a0\u25cf\u00a0\u00a0\u25cf\u201cI love you, JoJo.

Especially Katelyn who was so supportive and strong. I actually admired her for being that way after the loss of her husband Mason. I loved her twin girls that were such cuties. And Noah was so adorable and just full of life. Nick I liked but could be a bit of a jerk too. Nonetheless, I got where he was coming from. It must of been very hard for him to know he was losing the woman he loved. The story was a light with a few emotional moments. Very low in steam with there being only one sex scene that wasn't too descriptive. I loved the flow between past and present. I think it worked well without becoming annoying. I didn't like the reason Liam left, which we find out near the end. I think it was a stupid reason. The ending was sweet and tad bit cheesy. Overall, it was a good read and one I recommend when you want to read something that isn't full of angst and drama. It's definitely an 'inbetween books' read you should check out."}, {"userName": "Jacqueline's Reads", "userReviewDate": "Mar 13, 2013", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/4197769-jacqueline-s-reads", "userReview": "5 Second Chance Stars**SPOILER FREE REVIEW**Forever My Girl is a sweet, loving, all-around adorable read. If you, like me, have a thing for musicians, and reconnections, then this read is for you.Liam and Josie were high school sweethearts, but one day in college Liam decides to leave Josie to pursue a music career. Ten years later Liam comes back into town and Josie just doesn\u2019t know how to process any of it. Both want closure, but there are plenty of obstacles in their way from finding peace. \nForever My Girl isn\u2019t your typical rocker-comes-back-home love story. Honestly, it wasn\u2019t anything I expected and I loved it. First off, I think the writing style was perfect for me because there were no flashbacks! How is that so you ask? Well, there has to be memories so, yes there are flashbacks, but it\u2019s more like when a character has a quick memory. Heidi writes it in a unique way, where I enjoyed those moments. It\u2019s hard to explain, but you will get it when you read it.Josie is a florist and she didn\u2019t get any closure when Liam left, but it\u2019s been ten years so she moved on. She has her life and she has a steady boyfriend. Yes, **GASP** there\u2019s a love triangle. I KNOW! I liked a read with a love triangle. I really enjoyed this because it created a nice tension. So, here is Liam. Oh Liam, super successful, super sexy Liam. BUT! Liam hasn\u2019t really moved on from Josie, but he knows what he did was wrong and he just wants to make sure she\u2019s okay. \nI just gave you a tiny glimpse of what\u2019s to expect. I didn\u2019t want to give everything away, so you really need to read Forever My Girl. There are no annoying parts and I did have any pull \u2013you-hair-out moments. THANK YOU!!! This read isn\u2019t steamy either, but there\u2019s plenty of sexual tension to keep you going. You just want to root for them from start to finish and there are plenty of reasons why they should be together, but like I said a lot of obstacles in the way to make it difficult.Look, there\u2019s a reason why this book has been opted for a movie and I am beyond excited for that. I can\u2019t wait to see it and I can\u2019t wait to move on to the novella, My Everything and book 2, My Unexpected Forever.

I'm not sure I want it back.\nSo many feels man! So many fucking feels. I didn't really think I would like this book, because I honestly hated Liam right on the first page. But when I finished... Oh god! I was tearing up... I'm so happy Josie and Liam had their happily ever after. I'm such a sucker for happy endings!!I hate guys who leave girls without any explanation. That is suck a dick move. It's the worse way you could leave someone. I'd prefer you break my heart and tell me you don't love me, than just leaving without telling me why. So imagine how I felt when I read of Liam. That was exactly what he did. This is not a spoiler, because this was on the blurb, but yeah... hated Liam. Detested him. Abhorred his entire existence. I'm not even kidding. I really disliked him right on the first chapter.So anyway, I'll probably dwell more on my thoughts about Liam later on.. Let me start with telling you about the story.THE INTRODUCTION\nA light snore reminds me that I'm not alone. The heaviness of a body sprawled out, sets me off immediately. The stale smell of day old perfume lingers in the air and on my sheets.\nTHE GIST\nMy decision destroyed everything.\nLiam's life has been pretty much planned out. Finish highschool.Go to college.Join the NFL.Marry his girlfriend.Have kids.Normal stuff.But when the opportunity knocked, he knew he had to grab it, because if not, the moment will pass him by. Yeah right!!To follow his dream, he had to leave everything behind: his family, his friends, college... and most of all, his girlfriend, Josie. your are a dickhead!\nI did this for me and I did it the only way I knew how. I just didn't think I'd care so much about missing everything.\nAfter running away from it all, he never came back to Beaumont since. That was until, his best friend, Mason, died. He knew he had to go back. oh shit this is making me really angry.\nAnd now I'm heading home to face the music.\nJosie's life changed drastically when Liam walked out on her without telling her why.\nMy life was turned-upside down with just a few short words and a door slam, creating a wall between me and the love of my life.\nYears pass, and Josie moved on. At least that's what she tells herself. She now Nick who had been constantly at her side, since Liam left. Even though I didn't like Nick, at least he was man enough to be there for Josie when she was down and also help her raise her son, Noah. (Now, we all know who the father of this kid is right?) Nick has been asking her to marry him, but she was still unsure. Maybe it was because at the back of her mind, she was still waiting for fucked up Liam who left her without any fucking reason. \nIt was time to make a decision. A man like Nick isn't going to wait around forever. Everyone says he's a catch because he's the one of us who really makes something from his eduation and they're right.\nBut wait, Liam comes back... Sorry darling, but he didn't come back for you. see what a dickhead Liam was. He came back to see his best friend, Mason, through to his final resting place. Despite the hurt that Liam brought her when he inexplicably abandoned her, she still felt something... something that she thought she already left behind. But after then years... the feeling was still there.\nI never thought I'd feel anything for Liam again. Those feelings had been long dead and then he started coming around.\nLiam's plan was to stay until Mason's funeral, then leave. He felt that he had no other reason to stay in Beaumont. He knew that Josie hates him and didn't want to wreck her life more than he already did in the past. But he met someone he wasn't expecting. He unexpectedly met Noah.THE CHARACTERSJosie: I easily related to her character. She had been strong throughout the book. I was happy that she didn't go immediately running to Liam, pulling off her clothes immediately when Liam came back. I admire her for keeping her shit together, even when it's just for show.Ten years have passed and she still had not gotten over Liam. She knew it, but she didn't want anyone else to know that. Especially not Noah. She wanted to protect her son from the heartache that she felt when Liam just threw her and their relationship away for fame, which she didn't know at the time. She didn't want Noah thinking that his father didn't love him. \nI want this.I want to feel him.\nAnd she said this, when she was still together with Nick. And this literally, made me shake my head. I don't approve of cheating. I mean they didn't have a relationship, Liam and Josie, at this point, but the fact that she kissed someone else (yes they did kiss) aside from her fiancee, seems a lot like cheating to me. And I didn't like it. I mean if she really don't love Nick, just... break up with him. I get that she owed him a lot. She does really. I mean, he had been there for her, when Liam was out fucking some other bitch. Nick was the one that was there. Helping her in every way he can, although, he was a dick sometimes too. But come on, he deserves a bit of respect on that regard. I think this was just one of the things I did not approve of that Josie did.But other that, I thought Josie was a great character. Relatable. Flawed.Strong.Liam: I think I mentioned this earlier. But I hated Liam, start from the first page. Based on the blurb, we already knew what he did. And just reading about that first scene, where he was in bed with a skank, made me hate him immediately. Instantly.His reason for leaving, reminded me of Mia's (from Where She Went). \n\n\"Because it wasn't like that, I felt like... like I was suffocating.\"\n\nI understand, but then I don't approve of the way they left the people who love them behind. I thought it was selfish and inconsiderate. I mean come on, the people you left, are not just people you know. They fucking love you. The least they could have done is said something. They could have understood and supported their decision. The good thing about Liam's character was... despite him seeming like a dick on the first 1/4 of the book, he starts to redeem himself. You sort of get to the point where you sympathize for him and what it must have been like for him to choose between two lifes that he want to have.\n\n\"God damn it, Jojo. If I knew about the baby I would've stayed and figured something out. I would've married you and gone back to school.\"\"But you wouldn't have been happy?\"\n\nLiam's character was unperfect, in the most perfect way. He was honest, to the point that he wants to be honest so that he doesn't hurt anyone by lying. Also, he had been nothing but loving to Noah. They hid the truth from Noah for a while, but that didn't stop him from showing Noah that he adores him. Such a sweet gesture. I love guys who are good with kids.THUMBS UP:- The whole story spoke to me. - The pace.- The character development.- The ending.- Mason. Okay. Mason was a secondary character, that you don't even get to meet. But oh boy, did I love this guy. If you read this, you'll understand why. In the beginning, I wasn't exactly that invested with Liam and Josie's story yet, but Mason's passing... tug some heartstrings.. So sad.- The romance. I loved it. Honestly adored the relationship that Josie and Liam had back in high school, and after when the truth came out and everything. Just one of the most perfect couple. THUMBS DOWN:- Predictability. I knew they would end up together. I would have liked it better if Nick was a better person than how the author made him here, because then, there would be a possibility of him and Josie ending up together... So yeah. FINAL RAMBLINGSMy Forever Girl was a great read. I loved how it dealt with different types of relationship. Between friends, lovers, family, and your child. It also touched on forgiveness and moving on. I think the reason why I liked this book was because I could relate a lot to it, but I'm not wishing my ex back. Not in a million years or in the next thousand lifetimes. I will never ever get back together with him. But I do admire Liam and Josie's love. Despite being apart for a long time, they still have that connection, that love.True love.Will I recommend this? Definitely."}, {"userName": "Christy", "userReviewDate": "Dec 19, 2012", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/11284813-christy", "userReview": "\"Arms of a stranger, a warm blooded kiss, trying to fill the void, of the one that I miss.Perfume whispers, lashes and lace, but I can only hear your voice, I'm so out of place.All these painkillers, thats all they are.

Amores del pasado? Drama? Dos p\u00e1ginas despu\u00e9s resulta que hay hasta un ni\u00f1o de por medio, todo el drama de \"no sab\u00eda que era mi hijo, por qu\u00e9 nunca me lo dijiste y todo aquello, y pues dije ok... no es mi tipo de lectura pero le dar\u00e9 la oportunidad...Liam es un chico que quer\u00eda hacer su vida diferente a lo preestablecido, veia que todo era predecible y el lo que quer\u00eda era hacer m\u00fasica, sin embargo JoJo, la protagonista, no le prest\u00f3 atenci\u00f3n en su momento y crey\u00f3 simplemente que eran \"cosas suyas\" Eso puedo entenderlo.Genial. Se va, no le dice adi\u00f3s a nadie. Sus pap\u00e1s son una escoria, blablabla. Cambia de tel\u00e9fono, ni siquiera de su mejor amigo se despirde porque quiere \"cortar de ra\u00edz\"... Aja...Ok... Mmmm... sigamos.Jojo en realidad intento muchas veces decirle que estaba embarazada pero a la final nunca se lo logr\u00f3 decir... ya aqu\u00ed me tincaba el melodrama mexicano... Luego viene la locura... Podr\u00eda decirles que esto es spoiler, pero la trama es tan estupidamente obvia que para que lo escondo.El encuentro entre Liam y Jojo no me causo en lo absoluto ninguna emoci\u00f3n, mejor dicho, los personajes carecian de cualquier emoci\u00f3n para mi. Liam vuelve al pueblo por la muerte de su mejor amigo, que resulta ser el esposo de la mejor amiga de Jojo. No s\u00f3lo Jojo es tan egoista que ni siquiera le presta apoyo a su amiga, sino que se la pasa entre \"lo amo, pero no lo amo, lo quiero, pero no lo quiero, le digo que quiero estar con \u00e9l, pero no, soy una mujer comprometida\"... El problema de todo esto es... que \u00e9l protagonista ni siquiera le hab\u00eda pedido nada.Liam nunca se ve lo suficientemente arrepentido a mi parecer. Todo lo contrario. Simplemente no pude soportar ver como el se hacia a todas estas el orgulloso...M\u00e1s blablabla, a la final hablan con el ni\u00f1o y esto pasa...En el momento que Liam y Jojo le dicen al ni\u00f1o que este es su pap\u00e1, la autora considera que el mejor momento para que ellos se besen... si JUSTO ALLI en frente del ni\u00f1o JUSTO cuando le dicen eso...el se levanta de la mesa, juro que va a abrazar al ni\u00f1o o abrazarla a ella, pero no...considera que besarla es lo mejor.OMG... m\u00e1tenme, m\u00e1tenme YA. Por supuesto all\u00ed no termina el drama. Siguen m\u00e1s \"te quiero, pero no te quiero\". Liam vuelve a la ciudad a grabar... y para dar ejemplo de una de los m\u00e1s estupidos pensamientos que tiene este libro, \u00e9l llega a la siguiente conclusi\u00f3n, mejor no llamo a mi hijo inmediatamente, porque \"que tal que no quiera hablar conmigo ahora que me fui?\". Palabras textuales. Otro pensamiento de Jojo\nLiam: \"No lo abandonar\u00e9. S\u00e9 que mi palabra vale una mierda para ti, pero voy a hacer cualquier cosa para demostrarlo. Quiero ser su pap\u00e1. Se supone que deb\u00eda ser nuestro, Jojo, y lo jod\u00ed. Pensamiento magistral de Jojo:\"No puedo evitar que las l\u00e1grimas salten cuando dice cosas como esta. No es de extra\u00f1ar que \u00e9l sea un escritor de canciones y hace que millones de mujeres se enamoran de su m\u00fasica\" \n All\u00ed creo entre en coma por dos milisegundos... Por supuesto que un poco m\u00e1s de drama, relleno, drama , celos est\u00fapidos de Jojo por su mejor amiga que esta pasando luto y con dos ni\u00f1os acuests?!!! nono... No puedo ni siquiera...ya saben como termina, claro que si.La historia no me hubiese importado que fuera clich\u00e9... repetida o lo que sea mientras este bien construida, con unos personajes que te emocionen pero definitivamente este no fue el caso, me voy decepcionada.Quiz\u00e1s el rating de este libro viene de los sentimentalismos de una relaci\u00f3n padre-hijo y las segundad oportunidades? Pero para mi est\u00e1 pobremente escrito y estoy segura que hay historias parecidas mejor contadas."}, {"userName": "Natasha is a Book Junkie", "userReviewDate": "Nov 16, 2012", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/9389992-natasha-is-a-book-junkie", "userReview": "\u201cHey, Jojo?\u201d he yells.\u201cYeah.\u201d I yell back.\u201cI\u2019m going to marry you someday.\u201d\n\nSome people find their dream early on in life, some never do, and some sacrifice everything to capture it. Liam found his dream in the first semester of college, a dream that cost him everything he cared for, including the woman he desperately loved.Growing up in a strict patriarchal family, the only child of a man who had very clear ideas about what his son\u2019s future should look like, and of a woman who gave up her own dreams to become someone\u2019s silent trophy wife, Liam was given a non-negotiable path to follow, expectations to meet, and an enormous amount of pressure to become the man they all thought he should become. But no one ever asked Liam what he dreamed of becoming one day.Josie was the girl he fell in love with in high school. She was his best friend. She was his first and only love. She was the girl he left behind to pursue a dream. Stuck on a path that he did not see as his own, Liam sacrificed the one he loved the most to save himself from becoming something he hated, all along knowing that he could never be the man everyone, including Josie, wanted him to be. He suddenly cut ties with everyone in his life and moved away to prove to himself that he could become someone else. His career as a musician quickly took off and he spent the next ten years torn between the dream he was fulfilling and the ache in his heart always reminding him of the one he left behind. He wrote songs about her, channelling his loneliness and heartbreak over losing her into his music. His life changed, he found fame, but his feelings for his \u201cJojo\u201d never faded, frozen in time and forever tormenting him.\n\u201cI may be successful when I\u2019m on stage, but at night I\u2019m alone.\u201d\nAnd then one day life took him back to the very place he ran away from.Josie spent the past ten years trying to ignore the hole in her heart caused by Liam\u2019s sudden departure. For years she felt abandoned and discarded, believing that the only man she ever loved no longer wanted her or any reminder of what they once shared. She eventually rebuilt her life, moved on, never expecting one day for her past to just walk into her shop, for the boy who stole her heart to come back and be still in love with her.\n\u201cI went right to your shop and waited. I watched for you and once I saw you, I knew I was going to end up chasing my girl, waiting for you to turn around and see\u2026 the real me and love me for who I am and not what I did to you. I\u2019m standing in front of you, Josie. You just have to turn around.\u201d\nThis is an utterly moving story of second chances in life, of redemption, remorse, forgiveness, of loves lost and found again, of trust regained. Through alternating points of view, we feel both Liam and Josie\u2019s emotions, fears, and sorrow. These are well-developed characters whose love for each other survived time and distance. They naturally gravitate towards each other, unable to fight the pull and incapable of forgetting the future they once dreamed of sharing. When faced with what they could have had, Liam and Josie must decide whether they could still mend what is broken or whether life has just become too complicated to change. Nothing is rushed, the storyline progressing at a pleasant pace that keeps the reader both glued to the pages as well as more and more invested in the ending.When two people spend ten years convincing themselves they can be apart, sometimes the best cure is to be reminded of why they felt in love in the first place.\n\n\u201cMy palms sweat. My body is flushed. I open my eyes and stare at the woman in the mirror. Staring back is a girl I once knew, one that shined and sparkled every time she was about to go see her boyfriend. This girl looks happy.\u201d\n\n[4.5 BRIGHT SHINING STARS] ~ N \u2665See this review on my blog! | Follow me on Facebook!"}, {"userName": "Anna", "userReviewDate": "Dec 14, 2012", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/6744426-anna", "userReview": "Pretty much convinced that I love all characters named Liam !
