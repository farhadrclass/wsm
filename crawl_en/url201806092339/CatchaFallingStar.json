Turns out Adam Jakes is there to act in a new movie, a Christmas Carol retelling in fact.Carter isn\u2019t the kind to fangirl over actors and that\u2019s why she would be perfect as Adam\u2019s fake girlfriend. She is someone who doesn\u2019t take much place, is calm and could make Adam look like the most adorable boyfriend. The only reason she does accept the proposition is to save her brother, John, who is an addict and owes money to someone. A LOT of money\u2026While this could seem like a predictable\u2014it is\u2014, cheesy\u2014that too\u2014story, it also is one of the cutest and\u2026light stories I\u2019ve read this year. Yes, the plot could have been deeper and more detailed but, if you could see the story as I do (cute summer read) you will enjoy this book regardless those elements.The characters were great but do lack of characterization when you think about it. They are all likeable but that can be, probably, because we don\u2019t know them that well\u2026so we can\u2019t actually judge them or it would seem unfair\u2026somehow. The only character we do manage to get to know well enough is Carter, our main one, and that seemed enough for me since I did connect with her and empathized with her situation.Adam is\u2026who you think he might be; handsome, popular, charming, in-love-with-his-iPhone, and living in this I-m-a-movie-star-everybody-loves-me nutshell. BUT, he has a major character development and that pretty fast in the story I must say. That fact seemed very unrealistic because, while I believe someone can change,\u2014not completely though\u2014I don\u2019t believe they can do so that fast. STILL, if Adam had stayed the way he were before, I may not have liked this book as much as I do now.What a beautiful writing this story contains! The author included some wonderful and impressive metaphors from time to time and those were absolutely one of the things I loved most in her writing. Her style is great and she managed to write this story with a pacing that is neither slow nor fast, which is not a very easy thing to do.The plot is very Disney-like (except for the addiction) and I loved that about it but, while I know John\u2019s problem may have been the one of the \u2018starting points\u2019 of the story, I was wondering why that had to be it. The ending doesn\u2019t let us know much about John when I hoped it would. I thought that he might do\u2026what the author led us on to think he might do. It just felt like filler at the same time (for him being in the story.)I would definitely recommend this book to anyone who is looking for a light contemporary romance summer read. The author has a true talent in writing so I\u2019m looking very forward to reading her other and next works."}, {"userName": "Ash Wednesday", "userReviewDate": "Mar 10, 2014", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/10484016-ash-wednesday", "userReview": "3.5 STARSEven Hobbits have to take adventures. That's how they bring back stories to the Shire.\nI am flummoxed. Baffled.Bewitched, bothered and bewildered how this book managed to pull something off of me, a plot-twist of sorts in my reading habits. We often get disappointed and underwhelmed but it\u2019s quite a rarity to start off with notes snarking on the cringe-inducing cliches only to end up halfway through not making notes at all and just paying attention. You start to take it seriously. You realize hey, this book has something to say outside the stale and recycled premise. The message was hardly original but I was taken aback that there was a message at all. One that came across with heartfelt sincerity despite the cheesy and unpolished delivery methods.The small town of Little, California has been chosen as the location for the comeback propaganda movie (the ridiculously premised A Christmas Cheryl) of troubled young star Adam Jakes. In his efforts to charm the public and improve his image, he hires the plain and provincial Carter Moon to portray the real-life small-town girl he supposedly falls for while filming. In her desire to help her brother from the financial snaggles of his gambling problem, Carter agrees. And what follows is the extremely predictable trope of Adam being charmed by the simplicity of the small-town and Carter discovering the \u201creal\u201d person behind the entitled, troubled boy.Except, despite that predictability, Culbertson did a brilliant job in communicating the depth of both Carter and Adam's characters.The effort to paint Adam as a big star fell flat, coming across as a B-movie star filming a direct-to-DVD film instead of the blockbuster this story was trying to sell. He started off like a Reid Alexander-esque character who transitioned awkwardly into a somewhat bad-boy-gone-good, misunderstood hero who just happens to understand his job a little too well. For me, this could have been done in a more seamless manner (or not done at all, actually) but the end product did deserve some merit, even if I'm not particularly a Frankie Muniz fan. In terms of the romantic chemistry between him and Carter, it was either too reined in or it really just was close to nil making me hanker for a more believable ending than what this disappointingly dished. I find them more interesting as two young people trying to make sense of life in the context of their contrasting realities.Surprisingly, my favorite aspect in this book is its Pollyanna heroine, Carter. She's seventeen going on forty, a self-confessed hick who gave up a dance scholarship in New York because she wants to stay in Little helping out in her family's diner, holding dance classes for octogenarians and keeping a stargazing blog. She doesn't have a facebook or know how movies are made. It really REALLY was so easy to hate her.\n\nDancing was hard work. But hard work was not ambition. Ambition was something else. And I didn't have it.\n\nIt's a tricky age, seventeen. You have the whole world at your feet, people urging you to follow your dreams, to take life by the balls. Not having an ambition will probably send your parents into an apoplexy. But the hardest thing, harder than making it out on your own, is distinguishing between what makes you happy and the people around you happy. And that's what made me fall in love with Carter, she portrays that conflict brilliantly. She's a girl-next-door caricature and it's a bit of a stretch to believe that her thought process as reflective of her age and upbringing but there's this exchange between her and her dad that reveals an unexpected layer in her character.The writing felt a little off at certain points, sometimes it felt like characters were breaking the fourth wall getting carried away with the soapboxing about bigger issues. Those self-serving, pretentious kids posting photos in Facebook are doing the devil's work, yes but can we not thump the podium too often too hard?This also read a little too young for me. It\u2019s not one of those young adult books targeting an adult audience. But at the same time, I can imagine, with some effort, any person at any crossroad in their life connecting to the themes this was trying to drive across. In a poignant reminder sort of way rather than as a cautionary guide on navigating adulthood. \n\nHere's the thing you need to know. Here's a hint from Grown-Up World. There's no right way.

The summary of this book sounds so sweet and fun, but it's like I ordered a banana split with gummy bears, sprinkles and a cherry on top and ended up getting a scoop of vanilla with a couple random reese's pieces thrown on. It was just so light on everything, and I don't mean that as a happy, cute type of adjective, I mean it was lacking on all the good stuff!First off the characters had no personalities! They all got one or two adjectives, Carter is nice and confused about her future, Adam is hot and secretly nice (sometimes), Chloe is dramatic, Alien Drake is always relaxed... I need some depth! I couldn't connect with any of the characters so right off the bat I wasn't very engaged in the story.Also the plot in this book is light. We have a nice storyline but everything that actually happens in the book is just so uneventful and uninteresting! Then there's the writing. Usually when two characters kiss, especially in a book with this type of storyline, there's fireworks or tingles or something! But nope, not this time! It's just a simple he kissed me and thats it. No feelings, no descriptions, nada!So overall this book was just too light on all the main ingredients!

If you want Young Adult stories to read this summer, this is the book for you.I loved Carter Moon. You know how there's always a small-town character that dreams big and wants to leave to some big city to start living? Carter is the complete opposite. She's happy living in her small town of Little, CA. She lives in the now and doesn't think much of her future. And if she has to, her plans are pretty simple. She'll graduate high school, work more hours at her dad's cafe, go to the elderly center, back home, stargaze, repeat. Yet as the story goes on she discovers that while some people have trouble filling their minds with too many dreams and not live in the now, she's been living for too long in the now and not taken that much care to the tomorrow. Her voice was simple and interesting to read from. She put people before her and preferred to keep things as uncomplicated as possible. She talked instead of fight, and couldn't stand to lie to those she cares about. Which crashes a bit with what she's asked to do once a Hollywood Star comes to her Little town.The story was sweet, funny, swoony, all things I imagine a YA book to be. Even with all the growing romance between the two characters of Carter and Adam, the book also dealt with things really common in our lives. We often prejudice people by what we see, specially superstars like singers and actors/actresses. Not everything is how it seems and not everyone is how they make you think they are. There's more to people but we prefer to be lead by false things like social media and gossip rather than know the person and judge them through our own eyes and acquired knowledge.\n\"We create our own definition of success or failure. You can't hold yourself up to other people's versions of things. Not society's idea of things, and not other people's. Your own. But regret... well, that's a real thing. Take it from me. You should try things on, see if they fit you. If they don't, it's not failure. It's a choice.\"\nI loved how in this book, the author speaks about following your dreams, any dreams. To try something even if we won't be that for all our lives. We can't lose the opportunity when we have it thinking we'll fail or it's selfish. No one can decide for you what to do or not do. But if you don't do it, the small wonder of things will only grow in time to become regret and think all those What If's at night.There were also those random astronomy moments, I loved those! I love everything related to stars and the universe that I couldn't help but squeal whenever the characters stargazed and said astronomy facts, plus the cool blog entries they did occasionally <3It was really good to be honest. I loved every moment of this book, how relatable and real the characters were. From Carter's parents, her brother, friends, to Adam Jakes and the whole Hollywood movie crew. It was fun, fluffy, and inspiring. Another great thing was that the main character wasn't stupid and didn't do slut-shamming! I loved every single simple and unique thing about her.

Catch a Falling Star is a book that makes you throw out the idea of analyzing the details and allows you to just sit back and enjoy the completely predictable, light-hearted, warm fuzzy feeling that it brings. It\u2019s been a long time since I have been able to read a book in one sitting. Catch a Falling Star has the perfect additive romantic comedy feel that had me chuckling and beaming with each turning page. The whole idea behind the story is a little clich\u00e9. What are the chances that a small town girl would get the opportunity to play pretend girlfriend to an extremely successful movie star. I\u2019m thinking the chances are slim. But of course, this scenario is the perfect set up for silly banter, cheesy one liners, and the opportunity to play the lonely celebrity card who falls in love unexpectedly. I really don\u2019t want to downplay this book, though. There were a lot of special elements that made this book so much more than a typical contemporary romance. Carter Moon was a really realistic character. She\u2019s comfortable in her hometown of Little, California and has zero intentions of leaving her job at her family owned caf\u00e9, despite her opportunity to accept a dance scholarship. The family dynamic present in the Moon family was really strong and supportive. The underlying story of her brother\u2019s gambling addiction was quite heartbreaking, but really emphasized the loyalty that Carter and her family proved to have. It\u2019s nice to have a young-adult contemporary with an encouraging mother and father present. Maybe it\u2019s just me, but I don\u2019t see it very often in books. Aside from the family component, the additional hilarious side character friendships was the icing on the cake. Chloe added a lot of hilarious moments with her obsession of the Hollywood lifestyle, more specifically, all things revolving around Adam Jakes. When Carter, your best friend, starts dating the boy you have pictures of on your bedroom wall, things might get a little awkward, especially when your boyfriend becomes jealous. Drake, who also goes by Alien Drake, is Chloe\u2019s boyfriend and Carter\u2019s childhood best friend. Together with Carter he runs a blog revolving around all things stars, space, and alternate life forms. In between select chapters there are snippets of their blog posts that provide insightful messages interlinking life lessons with views of the galaxy. The subtle details of space throughout the book was really fun. I mean, Carter Moon falling in love with a movie star, while blogging about space. It can\u2019t get much cuter than that. Of course I have to save the best for last: the romance. It was everything I wanted it to be. Adam Jakes starts off appearing like a snotty, uptight celebrity who only cares about himself. It was the perfect pairing with Carter, who already has zero interest in celebrity affairs. Although their relationship starts off completely professional, including scheduled kisses, their feelings for each other turn into something more real. I mean it when I say this relationship is predictable, but it is the perfect guilty pleasure for a sweet, slow burning romance."}, {"userName": "Ornella (Nyx)", "userReviewDate": "Mar 01, 2014", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/6282007-ornella-nyx", "userReview": "This book mainly got my attention because every time I read the title I would start singing that song from the movie Princess Diaries. So I read the blurb and it sounded like a cute light read. And I guess it kind of was, but not good enough.I just didn't connect with Carter. At all. She actually frustrated me to no end. She tried coming off as this totally mellow, well adjusted teen who had all her shit together but instead she was just so into the self denial that I just wasn't buying any of the crap she spouted. I'm not saying she was a horrible, unrelatable character. I just didn't like her, personally. She was so close minded about almost everything. She, again, tried coming off as this totally great, forward moving person, but she just wasn't. She was trying too hard. As for Adam, I couldn't really get a reading on him. At first he was a grade A jerk. Which didn't feel right to me. It actually felt like Culbertson was pushing him into this role because that's what was expected. Then they share one laugh together and suddenly he just isn't a jerk anymore. It was too much of an abrupt face.The romance went along with the voice and atmosphere of the book itself. Slow, mellow, and a bit stunted. I just felt NO spark, no chemistry between them. What I got out of it was a nice start to a solid friendship, not a romance.And that ending? It came out of left field. Again, it was like Culbertson was forcing it because the reader just expects that kind of ending, but I was honestly all for how things would have ended right before that last chapter. It would have felt much more real to me.It wasn't a bad read, but it also didn't do anything for me."}, {"userName": "Gillian Berry", "userReviewDate": "Nov 14, 2013", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/13535966-gillian-berry", "userReview": "Originally posted at Writer of WrongsRating: I loved this! What a lovely, entertaining summer read. Plus, FAKE DATING.I bought this book partially on a whim and partially because I just love this kind of fluffy, modern-Cinderella story. Blame Notting Hill. Blame Teen Idol. Hell, blame Camp Rock, if you want to. I love them all. I could read/watch these types of stories for... well...And while this book is definitely that, it's got quite a bit more heart than I was expecting, and was actually way funnier. I am so glad I listened to that whim, because I really enjoyed Catch a Falling Star in a way I was not expecting, and here's why:Carter Moon: Our improbably named main character is funny. Oh, is she funny. She made me laugh so many times and was really the reason I became so engrossed in this book. She's the rare small-town girl who loves living in her small town and never wants to leave. Her friends call her a Hobbit, since she's content to stay in the Shire. She's mature, private, has a dog named Extra Pickles, and I love her. She very easily could have fallen into a lot of cliches, but she always felt very real to me.Little, California: I LOVE reading about small towns, probably because I grew up in the polar opposite of a small town, and Carter's hometown is like a NorCal version of Stars Hollow (so maybe kinda more like that town in Bunheads), and I loved it. It's full of history, charm, and quirks. It has colorful characters, but it's just one stop short of zany, which keeps it anchored in the real world.Chloe and Alien Drake: Carter's best friends are funny, supportive, and healthy. They also feel real, even though Drake being nicknamed Alien Drake due to his obsession with the sky and the cosmos and the possibility of life beyond is a bit strange. And again, Chloe--bubbly, celebrity-obsessed Chloe--could very easily have fallen into cliches, but she didn't. I loved her and her close friendship with Carter.Adam Jakes: ADAM. Movie star bad boy, man of many faces and facades. I found him very interesting. He's been in some tabloid trouble lately and needs an image rehabilitation. That's where Carter comes in. Adam is in Little to film a family friendly Christmas movie and needs a wholesome small-town girlfriend to complete the do-gooder image. Carter, immune to the lure of Hollywood and doer of community service, is the perfect choice.Carter's family: And behold the reason Carter agrees to be Adam Jakes' fake boyfriend for money. Her parents are wonderfully present and supportive, but her brother, John, has an addictive gambling problem, and it's tearing the family apart. Carter needs the money to help him.The swoons: So then Carter and Adam begin fake date, and I began to squeal like a Directioner at a One Direction concert because OMG. I loved how much they truly did not like each other to start. Adam is self-absorbed. He's far from perfect. He's a different Adam to every person he encounters. He struggles with telling the truth. He loves acting and performing and playing to an audience. Carter does not.But of course they come to UNDERSTAND each other and it's ADORABLE and Carter begins to get confused about what's real and what's not and yessssss so much yesssssss. Plus you get to learn a bit how movies are made and how much work it is, and Carter gets a taste of what being famous is like, and also chemistry. And funnies. And banter. Gillian like. But will things turn out? Will this be Model Behavior, or will it be Win a Date with Tad Hamilton! or even The Lizzie McGuire Movie? (I told you I really like it that famous person/regular person dating trope) (though not as much as I love the fake dating trope)Only tiny niggles: the stargazing blog that she runs with Alien Drake (still a silly name) is slightly unnecessary, there might have been ooooone beat missing in Carter and Adam's relationship, and every now and then the writing would pull away from the dialogue. What I mean by that is we'd be listening to two characters talking in quotation marks, and all of a sudden Carter would summarize what it is she said. As in, \"I told him about X and Y\" instead of just showing us telling him, like she was just doing. It's just a personal niggle, but that always tends to jerk me out of the immediate action.But those are small points. Honestly, I couldn't put this book down. It hit me at just the right time and in just the right way. A truly delightful summer read, and I hope you give it a try! It totally took me by surprise."}, {"userName": "Nasty Lady MJ", "userReviewDate": "Jun 01, 2014", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/4026143-nasty-lady-mj", "userReview": "To See full review click on one of the following links:My blogBooklikesCatch a falling star and put it in your pocket\u2026That song has stuck with me ever since I saw The Princess Diaries.And speaking of The Princess Diaries, this book does remind me a lot of Meg Cabot\u2019s novel, Teen Idol though that book was better written. It also reminds me a lot of the Disney movie, Star Struck, though this book was better than that movie.So what does that mean for Catch a Falling Star well it was okay.Not great.But okay.It\u2019s what I expected. To be honest, I really don\u2019t think it was worth being a hardback-it was more or less paperback worthy. But at the same time I didn\u2019t outright hate it and felt like I wasted my time.The plot is pretty simplistic. A girl gets hired to pretend to be some Zac Efron wannabe\u2019s fake girlfriend. If you\u2019re expecting a cute romance between the two of them, don\u2019t get your hopes up. I didn\u2019t get the thrills between Carter and Adam. Really, Adam is just man candy. However, as far as YA go I\u2019ve seen worse relationships.In fact, the interactions between the two leads is probably one of the weakest points of the novel. With the way the novel is pitched, I really thought the whole Carter/Adam relationship would\u2019ve been the most prominent feature of the novel, but it\u2019s not. Carter more or less plays the role that Luke Strikler does in Cabot\u2019s Teen Idol except while Cabot acknowledges that Luke and Jen have little to no chemistry and does not have them end up together, Culbertson does the opposite. And man these two are boring together.Also, Luke had much more personality than Adam. This might have been in part because Culbertson focused the book so much on Carter. And to be honest, I really didn\u2019t think I got to know her. Oh, I knew enough about her but the explanations of her motives. They really didn\u2019t make much sense to me. Let\u2019s look at a few of them:Carter quits dancing because she can\u2019t have fun all the time.Well, it\u2019s a little bit more than that, but not much. Seriously, though nothing is 100% fun except for bad TV. And that can just get annoying, so I guess that\u2019s not fun either. The lack of ambition that this character had though was astounding.She basically begs to ho herself out for her brother.Really. Instead of letting her brother face the consequences for his action, she hooks up with a movie star. Well, fake hooks up. But still.I still don\u2019t understand her blog.Astronomy, UFOs, movie stars. Well, I\u2019ll just ask the folks at Ancient Aliens.So, yeah. When it comes to it, I really had ambiguous feelings about this character. Based on the three examples I just wanted to smack her, but she wasn\u2019t the worst character I read about. Even though she was annoying beyond belief."}, {"userName": "Shane", "userReviewDate": "May 04, 2014", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/7660089-shane", "userReview": "Catch a Falling Star had an interesting premise. I liked the concept of Hollywood going to an unpopular location to film, and the idea of a famous guy falling for a regular girl. It's a cute story with some sweet moments, along with some scenes that made me cringe. Carter wasn't a bad character. She was a young girl coming into her own, but with the troubles of her brother and not believing in herself enough, she made the decision to remain in her small town instead of going after her dreams. And I like that her parents finally had that talk with her and made her open her eyes. As for Adam Jakes, he was swoon-worthy. A misunderstood guy. We all know that tabloids fabricate stories so I was a little surprised that Carter, along with her friends, bought so much into his supposedly \"issues.\" Speaking of friends, I honestly thought Alien Drake (I did not like that nickname) was jealous of Adam and Carter. He just seemed kind of off, then again any boyfriend would be upset with the way his girlfriend, Carter's other bestfriend, would go all fangirl over Adam. Chloe was a lot. I wanted to smack her at times and tell her to chill because of the way she was around Adam. No wonder he was a tad put off when she brought out the magazine with him and Carter on the cover.

I loved it. It's a perfect summer read. It's everything you want in a contemporary book, I don't know. I did love it though. The characters, the setting, the whole book is exactly what one wants when picking up a contemporary book. Personally I always enjoy the rich boy not so rich girl story line and the movie star/regular person story lines, it's some good reading and this book nailed it. This story is fun and cute and it has the realistic more serious real issues that I love in a contemporary. In this book it's mainly in the form of Carter's brother who has a major gambling addiction, owes bad people lots of money and just can't seem to stop himself from getting into more trouble, and then you have Carter who wants nothing more than to save her brother even if he doesn't want to be saved, this was one of my favorite aspects of this book. Then you have the movie star, who Carter thinks she is actually falling for but she doesn't know what's real and what's fake when it comes to Adam whose whole life seems to be one big publicity stunt. I liked how realistic their relationship was, I think the author took a bit of a different take on the movie star role than a lot of authors, while she showed the side where Adam is just liked anyone else she also made it abundantly clear that he wasn't and that he knew that. I loved and hated Adam, I wanted them to end up together and I didn't, but I was completely satisfied with the ending, non the less.Favorite Things - - Carter - I absolutely loved her character, I loved that she wasn't completely drawn into the movie star imagine, she wasn't obsessed with Hollywood but also she wasn't immune to it, because really who would be? I liked that at the end of the day Carter knew who she was, knew she didn't believe in Adam's superstar, every thing's an act life, and that she was completely happy with who she was, she wasn't like everyone else, she wasn't waiting to leave her small town behind the second that she could, you know? I loved her for that and I loved her when she started to realize that it was okay to want more and that she could always come back. -Adam - Like I said love hate relationship with this character but he was believable and perfect in his own way and I can appreciate that. -Alien Drake and Chloe (Carter's best friends) - Alien Drake will forever be my favorite name, ever. I loved both these secondary characters and the part they played in this story. Though in the beginning part of me wanted to slap Chloe a little bit. - The stars - I loved all the stargazing the characters do and the philosophizing and everything. I loved the little bits that were supposed to be posts from Alien Drake and Carter's blog and how it fit into the story. - I loved the backdrop of the Christmas Carol story, Adam is filming a remake and how it all fits into the way he was recovering from his \"bad boy\" imagine and all that. - I guess I loved that while this has the same premise as allot of other books and movies it's still completely original and satisfying.Least Favorite Things - - In a way I didn't like the way Carters parents acted forcing her to want something more than her small town, but this was a minor small annoyance. - I loved Adam through the whole first half and more of the book but then a few things happened in the last few pages that made me doubt how I wanted the book to end. -That's all.Overall - I loved it, it's a perfect summer read, if you love YA contemporary you will love this. If you loved This Is What Happy Looks Like by Jennifer E. Smith let me put it this way, as much as I loved that book this one is slightly better. =)Recommended for - Fans of This is What Happy Looks Like by Jennifer E.

I thought it'd read like your typical fan-fiction you'd see online where you'd have a typical, ordinary girl next door given the chance of a lifetime to meet and, predictably, fall in love with a celebrity who was not as one-dimensional as she thought, and the book would end with them living happily ever after. This was not the case. I didn't expect to learn anything, but I did. I didn't expect to have any questions raised about life, philosophize, or wonder, but I did. It's filled with lovable characters like Carter, her best friends Alien Drake and Chloe, Adam Jake, and the rest of the small town of Little, California, which was described so beautifully and shown so that I fell in love with it and wanted to move there myself. A lot of the times authors will lack in description to create an atmosphere that I can imagine, but Kim Culbertson manages to do this well: you get smells, sights, sounds, the feeling of the air, the light quality, etc. It's great with showing the problems people have growing up, making changes in their lives, deciding things, living with no regrets, trying to \"expand your horizons\" versus being content with where you are in life. This book is chock-full of quotable things. It might seem a little preachy, as in trying to teach you too many things at once, but I for one loved it. The blog posts that Carter and Alien Drake have in the book are some of my favorites, and I love that you don't know the author of each post so it could be from Alien Drake's feelings and hurts or Carter's. It also blends science, metaphors, and life lessons perfectly. I tried collecting some quotes to add in this review, but, unfortunately, there were too many, so I've added some that I can find, going back through the book:Morning, sky watchers. In 1961, John Kennedy said that we should explore space because it \"may hold the key to our future on Earth.\" It's been two weeks since Hollywood left Little, and since they've left, we've been talking a lot about we we watch movies. Why are they and the lives of their stars so important to us? We think it's much the same reason as Kennedy suggested. They might hold the key to something in our own future, in our own lives. Whether we search for answers in space o in the books we read, in the music we listen to, or through the movies we watch, the essential thing is that we keep exploring, that we keep pushing ourselves to find our possible lives. What possibilities will you seek out today?See you tonight, under the sky.I always have a hard time reviewing novels I actually like/love, and this in no way does the book justice, but trust me, even if it's not that deep, the dumb blurb belies a thoughtful novel that doesn't strain your brain too much.Even though the story actually focuses more on Carter and her deciding her future, there IS a cute romance involved. Adam, the celebrity love interest, is surprisingly insightful, full of wisdom, sweet, and funny. He pulled the sheet off my face. \"Today you're not working at all. I'm not long for Little, and I want to take you on a trip.\"I peered at him. For a guy who'd shot a movie all night, he didn't even look tired. \"My brother's in the hospital.\" \"Okay, this is ridiculous.\" He stood up and whipped the covers from my bed.I leaped up. \"What if I'd been naked?\"\"Then it would have been my lucky day.\" He held up a sundress. \"Get dressed.\""}, {"userName": "tomato girl", "userReviewDate": "Jun 11, 2016", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/52771601-tomato-girl", "userReview": "\"There were many things in this world to feel small \u2014 stars, cemeteries, oceans. They relaxed me. I liked being reminded of being small, mostly because it took the pressure off when people pushed you to be big.\"\nWas that really supposed to be inspiring? I can't say I enjoyed this book. Although it had some really great concepts, I would have liked to have seen the author make use of the potentials it had. I must say, I did admire was how the author managed to tie in astronomy in with this. \nPlot:\nA small town good girl meets a Hollywood star bad boy. Small town good girl is an obvious member the of Not-a-Fan-of-Hollywood fan club and is coincidentally hired to be the Hollywood star bad boy's fake girlfriend. But little had they'd planned, their friendship starts to become a little something more. At least, that's what the synopsis said. You need not get any further than that, because \nnothing else happens.\n You won't miss a thing if you leave it at just reading the synopsis. It had mentioned how this was nothing like Hollywood, but fun fact \u2014 it totally completely was. It was \nclich\u00e9 overload\n, but I guess I walked right into that one, having known the love interest would have been a Hollywood star. \nCharacters:\n So, we have our characters, Carter, Adam, Chloe, and Alien Drake. Protagonist, Carter Moon was a simple-town girl, whose biggest dream was to one day run her family restaurant, Little Eats in Little California. Then there is the energetic, lively Chloe, best friends with Carter. *NOTE: What is it with books having a simple minded protagonist with a dynamic best friend? It's unbelievable how often I see that. Seriously, is the main goal not to have an original story? This standardization has got to go. As for Alien Drake? He's that nerdy best friend of Carter's, that best friend that the girl will not have feelings for. Sound familiar? But here's the twist to that stereotype - he doesn't have feelings for her either. And then we have our charming love interest, Adam Jakes, who's as charming as a chair. They had nothing to themselves other than their assigned personality type. \nRelationship:\n I was especially disappointed with the romance, if that's even what you can call this. I wish, instead of being told of how she felt, it was shown. I wish there were more solid reasons as to why Carter felt the way she did towards Adam, instead of merely being persuaded by teen hormones. Yup. I said it.Overall, if you're looking for an absolutely heartwarming story that will leave you in tingles, I suggest you walk away now. Don't get me wrong, it did have its moments, and I honestly think it really comes down to if you enjoy Hollywood-type books or not. It is, however, a perfect book for a simple light rainy day read. Although it was nothing special or extraordinary, it wasn't completely terrible either. It was just another story with a typical Hollywood ending."}, {"userName": "Milka", "userReviewDate": "Mar 06, 2014", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/1982249-milka", "userReview": "If someone where to ask me what type of stories/people always get me, my list would look something like this: fictional guys who seem like assholes but who actually are sweet and somehow tormented, guys who like nerdy stuff, stories related to films and film-making, ice-hockey players with amazing butts, funny guys and fierce female characters... The list goes on, but already from the synopsis of Catch a Falling Star several of the items from my list can be spotted. Also, since I loved both This Is What Happy Looks Like by Jennifer E. Smith and The Distance Between Us by Kasie West, which kind of have a similar type of premises (small town girl, rich boy), I knew that I had to give this one a go. Carter lives in Little, California, a small town filled with Victorian houses and cute little cafes. She's enjoying her summer holiday before her senior year in high school, working in her family's cafe and spending nights stargazing with her best friends. She is content with her life in Little, enjoying the little things in life and envisioning her future in the town she had called her home for the whole life. Everything changes for Carter when Adam James, a Hollywood heart-throb with a messy past comes to Little to film a modern adaptation of Dickens' A Christmas Carol. Parts of the town are covered with fake snow in the middle of the summer for a Christmas shoot and suddenly Carter is pulled right into the center of the action. By making a deal with Adam and his agent to pretend to be Adam's sweet girl-next-door, small-town girlfriend to bump up Adam's public image, Carter becomes part of Adam's glamorous world of body guards and publicity stunts. But as she spends more time with Adam, she starts to wish that not all between then was just play for the photographers.The relationship between Carter and Adam is one used in literature and film for ages. She's not interested in celebrities and glamorous lifestyle and makes the decision to pretend to be his girlfriend just to help her family. He is famous, handsome, and bit of a dick. But as they spend more time together, the opposites start to attract and we learn that these characters are not all what they first seemed to be. Yes, it is a bit of a cliche, but hey, when you pick up a book like this, what do you expect? Probably something sweet and romantic? That this book can deliver to you.I think the major issue I had with this novel was the fact that though Carter is an interesting character, she occasionally seems almost too perfect. Everyone around the town loves her, she helps the poor and the elderly and just in general she seems to do no wrong. I guess there might be people out there who are actually like that, but I constantly kept waiting some type of flaw to appear. I had some issues with Adam as well, mainly just with the fact that though he is charming and all, I never really felt any type of connection to him - there was not really any swooning involved while reading this one. I really liked the stargazing scenes of the book and the little blog posts between the chapters. The book is generally well written and though the characters remain somewhat two dimensional at points, I still found myself enjoying most of it. I feel like this is the type of book you can bring with you to the beach or the pool and enjoy it there."}, {"userName": "Sherry", "userReviewDate": "Apr 29, 2014", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/18041763-sherry", "userReview": "[And the grand gesture? *shrugs* Kind of meh in my opinion.

Most of them have been really romantic. Catch a Falling Star, however, was as bland as they come. That\u2019s not to say there wasn\u2019t much to enjoy about this book. And who knows? Maybe it was meant to highlight a realistic portrayal of these type of relationships; and if that was the case, the author was relatively successful. But if you\u2019re expecting to swoon, fall in love, and even develop a mild crush on this celeb, you\u2019d be disappointed. I know I was.Carter Moon is not what you would expect of a girl from Small Town, USA. While most have dreams of getting out of dodge, she\u2019s perfectly happy helping out at her family\u2019s restaurant. In fact, she won\u2019t even complain if she ends up doing exactly that for the rest of her life. So when a Hollywood Invasion reaches Little, California, she was unprepared for the tremor of changes the caravan brought about. She also did not expect to be at the spotlight when Adam Jakes\u2019 PR team saw all the possibilities of what \u2018pretend romance with a small town girl\u2019 could do to the troubled star\u2019s notoriety.Carter was hesitant at first; She couldn\u2019t find any redeeming qualities to the teen heartthrob. When circumstances backed her into a corner, she finds herself in a scripted romance with the Hollywood It boy. In a surprising twist of fate, Carter would find what she wants out of life through the manufactured relationship she has with Adam. But the question remains, does she have what it takes to pursue a dream that she once put on hold?It really is about family and friendship. Carter\u2019s family is dealing with the troubles that her older brother brought upon their household. The only thing that boggles the mind is for someone as principled as her mother was, I thought she\u2019d have more of a staunch objection to Carter\u2019s business transaction with Adam\u2019s PR person. Her mother is a supposed activist who\u2019d rather be fighting for the rights of whatever cause she deems relevant. In the meantime, their home life is somewhat in disarray; the parental units seem to have given up hope that they can somehow save their errant son from a sure path to destruction. Carter Moon, however will not have it. So yes, knowing the type of person Carter is, I was not surprise with the ease in which she made the arrangement.As far as the romance goes, there was no chemistry to speak of between Carter and Adam. He\u2019s all sparkle and shine but there really is not much there. Though, I feel like their relationship progressed as it should since they\u2019re practically strangers. So the basis of being friends first worked well.Overall, I think readers will be disappointed if it\u2019s romance you\u2019re after. But the book\u2019s strong suit is the friendships and the camaraderie in a small town setting."}, {"userName": "Jackie (No Bent Spines)", "userReviewDate": "Mar 14, 2014", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/6732598-jackie-no-bent-spines", "userReview": "Thanks Netgalley and Publisher for this lovely book! It was worth the read with the adorable chracters and raw emotions. It was a real kind of magic. The kind of magic that let's you discover who you are meant to be. It's the kind of magic that let's you dream and hope and wish. ~Full review to comeMore reviews on No Bent SpinesREVIEWI wanted something real yet magical. I wanted something that gave me a sense of hope. I wanted something fresh and raw and real. And what could be more real than falling in love with a celebrity? I\u2019m kidding! Sort of. I didn\u2019t expect to resonate with the emotions and thought and actions that Carter said or did or felt but I did. She has the same problems and fears that a lot of teenagers have: the fear of leaving, being away from home. The fear of being forgotten. The fear of change. I mean there are a lot of teens who can\u2019t wait to get out of the town they\u2019ve been stuck in. But I\u2019m a homebody. And this one struck a chord with me that I really didn\u2019t expect. Carter\u2019s emotions for one, the need to save everyone, the fear of failing, I could totally relate to that and for me, that made this book kind of amazing. Let\u2019s talk about our two main characters and Carter\u2019s amazing friends. Carter and her friend\u2019s relationship was amazing. Her two best friends are dating. There\u2019s something they all love: stars. The night sky and all the metaphor\u2019s in this book amazed me. The way the blog posts related to their lives. They way that the sun and the atmosphere and just the universe in general was all linked back to their own lives never ceased to amazed me. I loved it all. What can I say? I love the sky. Then we have own movie star who starts out as a jerk but then turns out to be a HUGE teddy bear. But even teddy bears have issues and need to put their big boy pants on every once in a while. I loved how real their characters all are, down to her gambling-addicted brother and down- to- earth parents. Everything, even the movie and acting roles felt like something that could happen. This book felt like hope. This novel is constructed with fake roles and real feelings. It\u2019s a mash up of choreographed kisses and romantic tours. Catch a Falling Star is a story stuffed with secrets and fears and two people- who are ultimately star crossed- trying to figure out where they belong in the world. This book is a mash up of real problems, real people and is basically the definition of self- discovery. In total, this book was a pleasant surprise. Also that title is perfect? Catch a falling star, but who\u2019s the one falling? And who really needs to be saved?

All my favorites. This story actually reminded me quite a bit of This is What Happy Looks Like. And not-so-surprisingly I had very similar thoughts regarding this one as I did for Jennifer E. Smith\u2019s story. The similarities are mostly prefaced upon the fact that both of these stories contained teenager actors, giving them a similar vibe.Carter Moon, a local Little teenage daughter of a cafe owner, spent her days helping out her family, making sandwiches for her parents\u2019 place, and her nights stargazing with her friends. Carter was super sweet, everyone loved her, and she spent her spare time entertaining the elderly and helping the poor. Yes, there are probably people just like her in the world, but I was constantly expecting her to mess up somewhere. Maybe do something wrong here or there? But really, she was utterly flawless. Maybe a little too flawless for my taste.Chloe, her BFF, on the other hand, was very unique and, though somewhat annoying at times, very likeable to me. She was over-the-top obsessed with actors, celebrity gossip, and all things Hollywood. So when her best friend starts \u201cdating\u201d the celebrity heartthrob, Adam, whom she has plastered all over her walls, she\u2019s slightly shocked, you could say. Adam was portrayed as your stereotypical teenage actor, face in his phone 24/7, ordering others to serve him, and not really paying attention to the world around him. Yes, this story was cliche \u2013 the local girl that doesn\u2019t want to fall for the handsome celebrity, yet decides to pretend to date him for money to help her family, who is struggling with a few issues. But really, after reading that synopsis, most can assume that this story will be somewhat cliche. So going in expecting that is the way to go.One thing that kind of bugged me a bit was View Spoiler \u00bbI really wanted to love this one. The kind of love where you can\u2019t put a book down, despite your crying children or obligations at work. I\u2019m a bit saddened by the fact that I didn\u2019t have that level of love that I had expected. It seemed too long (though we all know I tend to like shorter books more, so that\u2019s probably just me.) and I felt that at times it was dragging a bit. I was bored a few times too, which really shocked me. Then at other times I would be totally invested in the story, enjoying every word. So odd. I\u2019m quite baffled by my feelings for this one.Overall, I think Catch a Falling Star will definitely appeal to many YA Contemporary readers, especially those that love their celebrity gossip.

And if I\u2019m a little honest, I really just bought it because I had a coupon, couldn\u2019t find anything else to buy, and I liked the cover.But for the sake of a decent review, let us run down the requirements of a mediocre, summertime kind of romance book.A homely and uninspired small town girl with some kind of family angst? Check.A male love interest who will initially treat her like shit and then mysteriously fall in love with her for some reason? Check.Unnecessary jealously from a third party or an unnecessary love triangle? Check.A best friend who is ditzy, stupid or otherwise as interesting as cardboard and may or may not get jealous over the main character? Check.An ending that goes something along the lines of YOU JUST DON\u2019T UNDERSTAND ME, or YOU\u2019VE BEEN LYING TO ME THE WHOLE TIME, or WE COME FROM DIFFERENT WORLDS. Check.Seriously, all this book is missing is the token black or gay character. So taking all of this into consideration, it\u2019s not like I was expecting much from this book. My expectations were rather low, actually, and that\u2019s possibly why I ended up enjoying this book. Through all the cheesy dialogue and predictable narration, the book ended up not being that bad. The characters actually had endearing moments, the relationship Carter had with her parents was considerably enjoyable, and the book was never boring or overly dissatisfying.There\u2019s absolutely nothing special here.

Carter's town becomes a giant glittery set and, much to her annoyance, everyone is starry-eyed for Adam. Carter seems to be the only girl not falling all over herself to get a glimpse of him. Which apparently makes her perfect for the secret offer of a lifetime: playing the role of Adam's girlfriend while he's in town, to improve his public image, in exchange for a hefty paycheck. Her family really needs the money and so Carters agrees. But it turns out Adam isn't at all who she thought he was. As they grow closer, their relationship walks a blurry line between what's real and what's fake, and Carter must open her eyes to the scariest of unexplored worlds - her future. Can Carter figure out what she wants out of life AND get the guy? Or are there no Hollywood endings in real life?", "title": "Catch a Falling Star", "url": "http://www.goodreads.com/book/show/18527496-catch-a-falling-star", "average": 3.87, "cover": "https://images.gr-assets.com/books/1383842405l/18527496.jpg", "reviews": 777, "authors": [{"url": "https://www.goodreads.com/author/show/884212.Kim_Culbertson", "name": "Kim Culbertson"}], "type": ["Young Adult", "Contemporary", "Romance", "Realistic Fiction", "Womens Fiction"], "outlinks": ["http://www.goodreads.com/book/show/18527496-catch-a-falling-star", "http://www.goodreads.com/book/show/18816733-catch-a-falling-star", "http://www.goodreads.com/book/show/9633221-instructions-for-a-broken-heart", "http://www.goodreads.com/book/show/1945263.Songs_for_a_Teenage_Nomad", "http://www.goodreads.com/book/show/24647866-the-possibility-of-now", "http://www.goodreads.com/book/show/32332925-the-wonder-of-us", "http://www.goodreads.com/book/show/13181001-the-liberation-of-max-mctrue", "http://www.goodreads.com/book/show/33616599-beneath-the-shine", "http://www.goodreads.com/book/show/22583196-time-s-divide", "http://www.goodreads.com/book/show/23745439-greensleeves", "http://www.goodreads.com/book/show/20526820-gilded", "http://www.goodreads.com/book/show/26580636-infinity-lost", "http://www.goodreads.com/book/show/31160055-the-last-cherry-blossom", "http://www.goodreads.com/book/show/18108877-timebound", "http://www.goodreads.com/book/show/25071002-the-banished-of-muirwood", "http://www.goodreads.com/book/show/40193601-keeping-you-a-secret", "http://www.goodreads.com/book/show/40205002-fractured", "http://www.goodreads.com/book/show/35120598-gena-finn", "http://www.goodreads.com/book/show/35914878-pretty-dead-girls", "http://www.goodreads.com/book/show/29103028-the-queen-s-poisoner", "http://www.goodreads.com/book/show/32532886-trusting-you-other-lies", "http://www.goodreads.com/book/show/9409759-powers", "http://www.goodreads.com/book/show/36316055-touch-of-eternity", "http://www.goodreads.com/book/show/40192858-dragon-rider"]}
