It should be made clear the fantasy element suggested by the mermaid in the title stays in the background until the latter stages of the story. It is 1785, and John Hancock, merchant, frets over the possible loss of one of his ships. A captain of one of his ship's informs him excitedly that he has sold his ship to purchase a 'mermaid', a dead thing with the tail of a fish and the body of a monkey. Initially Hancock feels it is of precious little value only to find he is mistaken and off the mark. There are widespread rumours and curiosity for the weird 'mermaid' and people are willing to pay to see it. Hancock finds himself in a scenario he never expected to be in, he comes to enter a wider society and connects with elements of London he has no experience of. He meets the most famous courtesan in London, Angelica Neal, and an unconventional romance blossoms between the odd couple. However, their path to true love is littered with obstacles. It is said that the power of mermaids is to destroy, but is this so? The role and magic of the mermaid becomes central closer to end of the novel. Gowar's prose is beautiful, overflowing with wonderful descriptions and rich period details. London is evoked brilliantly with its changes in society, the theatres, the brothels, the coffee houses, the villainy, the dangers, the dirt and the stench. This is not a perfect book by any stretch of the imagination, but I loved reading it, finding myself immersed in the world created by Gowar. A great read!

While trying to find a way to make money of this, he crosses paths with Angelica Neal, a courtesan whose protector has unexpectedly died.My thoughts on this are very complicated. I don\u2019t think I have been this unsure how to rate a book this year yet. Therefore, here are my thoughts, first in list form and then more elaborate:Pros:- mesmerizing language- wonderful description- immersive setting- unpredictable plotCons:- glacial pacing- characters- meandering plot.This is one of the most beautifully written books I have read this year. Imogen Hermes Gowar has a brilliant way with words and I love how immersive her setting is. I could picture every single thing she describes, from the shipyards, to the brothels, to the houses of the rich and the houses of the merchants, to the parks and alleys. The dresses and the way people looked came alive in her description and this made for a vivid reading experience.However, the pacing was glacial and the plot meandering. Told in third person from numerous perspectives, I am quite unsure what the main story was supposed to be. (Jonah Hancock and his niece and sister and their relationships are one focus of this work, Angelica Neal and her confidante another, her relationship with another suitor the third, Mrs Chappell and her prostitutes another, then there is a the subplot of Polly, one of Mrs Chappell\u2019s black prostitutes and how she is treated for being such, then the search for another mermaid and so on and so forth.) While plenty of these perspectives could have been interesting we often did not spend enough time with these people for them to come alive. The two main protagonists, Jonah and Angelica, also stayed undefined for me. Especially Angelica was hard to root for in the first half of the book, although she did grow on me in the end. I wish the plotting had been tighter or (and I cannot believe I am saying this about a 500-page long book) the book longer. I would have liked more closure on some of these storylines (especially Polly\u2019s!).Ultimately, what will stick with me is the unbelievably beautiful writing. While long stretches were excruciatingly boring there was never a moment where Imogen Hermes Gowar was not in perfect command of her language. This alone is enough for me to be excited about what she will do next.I received an arc of this book courtesy of NetGalley and Harvill Secker in exchange for an honest review."}, {"userName": "Simon", "userReviewDate": "Jan 21, 2018", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/7232880-simon", "userReview": "I insist you all read Imogen Hermes Gowar\u2019s fabulous debut The Mermaid & Mrs Hancock; a historical romp with wonderful characters, saucy shenanigans, dark glimmering corners of 1700\u2019s society and possibly a mermaid or two.

Click here for the full reviewAstonishing storytelling and highly atmospheric, surprising to believe it's a debut novel. Has a few flaws here and there but I loved it so much wouldn't let anyone say anything nasty about this book!The story is set in late 1700's London. Mr Hancock, a wealthy merchant, acquires a mermaid unwillingly to compensate a loss in trade. Although he considers himself no showman, he is tempted to display the mermaid in hopes of making some money.\u00a0 His mermaid becomes an attraction soon enough and a 'madam', Mrs Chappell, seizes the opportunity making him an offer to display the creature for a week in her own establishment. As you can imagine, this is a brothel and Mr Hancock meets the beautiful, practical but no-so-calculated courtesan, Angelica Neal.\u00a0 Angelica is 27- only a few years before she loses her teeth, or gets gray hair,\u00a0 no longer desirable enough to be kept. She has been recently abandoned by a 'keeper' and looking for another one. Although she looks like a free woman from outside, unlike the mermaids floating in the sea freely, Angelica is imprisoned in the society depending on men for her living, in company of women like Mrs Chappell.Forget your dignity. You can discover it again when you have made your fortune. As for disdain, there's no place for it here. This world elevates the industrious man, and if you are canny it will elevate you. Disdain! Dignity! I never heard such squabbles.says Mrs Chappell to one of the courtesans. The girls she spoke to, described as silent as mules in response. Inhuman. Creature-like. There is the magical creature in this novel, yes, but what Gowar also does is to portray humans as creatures of interminable wants and needs, always hungrily, selfishly seeking comfort,\u00a0 material or emotional. There are a lot of metaphors in the book, but not much magical realism really, except just towards the end it is quite a solid and realistic story. It's difficult to classify but I wouldn't call this book a work of fantasy or magical realism.The mermaids, being hunted, displayed, imprisoned, forms a strong subtext of human's cruelty to other creatures in this story- I couldn't stop thinking about the imprisoned Dolphins while reading- just for the desire of owning, or entertainment.Also the imprisoned mermaid sending waves of grief is a breathtaking metaphor of a kept woman (wife or courtesan), which deeply effected me and is one of the reasons I would classify this as an all-time-favourite read, despite the little flaws. (It's a debut, so let's forget about Polly and her little stream of story line in this deep ocean of 500 pages)LOVED the ending and will be looking out for the next novel from Imogen Hermes Gowar."}, {"userName": "Sara", "userReviewDate": "Nov 23, 2017", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/1170391-sara", "userReview": "I received a copy of this book in exchange for an honest review,I think I was expecting more from this than delivered - and I don't think that's entirely the books fault. I was expecting magical realism, fantasy and mermaids based on the blurb. What I got was a well written historical romance novel, steeped in descriptive prose that felt a little flat to me.The Mermaid and Mrs Hancock follows a humble merchant and his love for a courtesan, whom he meets after a chance encounter with a mermaid.Jonah was a little dull in character, and felt as though he was severally lacking in any emotional depth (and backbone). Angelica, our courtesan, in comparison is scatty and all over the place. I wasn't keen on her characterization either, as she felt so different to Jonah, and I couldn't really understand her interest in him at all.The pace is agonizingly slow, and the romance takes a long time to develop. I understand that the constraints of the time meant a romance of this nature would be upheld with trepidation and many longing glances - but unfortunately I felt it meandered too much before anything really happens. The ending, although it took a long time to get to, also left a lot of loose story lines which annoyed me.I really didn't get what I expected out of this unfortunately.

His world is flipped upside down when one of his ship's captains returns from a voyage with a \"mermaid\" in tow (really a monkey's torso with a fishtail attached, but nobody seems the wiser). Hancock puts this specimen on show and becomes the talk of London, making a tidy sum of money in the process. The exhibition also causes him to cross paths with Angelica Neal, a fetching courtesan who is at something of a loose end. Hancock is immediately smitten, Angelica less so, but their encounter sets in motion a sequence of events that neither of them could have expected.What I enjoyed most about this novel is the convincing atmosphere it creates. 1780s London is wonderfully imagined, from the clatter of carriages on the cobbled streets to the stench of chamber pots emptied onto unsuspecting bystanders. Hermes Gowar's command of the period's vernacular adds greatly to this - comely jades recline on sophas, clothed in the finest silk mantuas and bringing sweet millefruits to their lips.But there is a real lack of drive to the narrative. Much as I revelled in the sumptuous period detail, the plot seemed quite aimless to me. I couldn't really understand what the novel was trying to achieve. Does it see itself as a bustling historical romp or an unlikely romance of two mismatched souls? The characters themselves don't seem to know what they really want. And there is a sub-plot involving a black prostitute which is so half-baked, it might have been better to omit altogether.The book has been unanimously praised and was recently longlisted for the prestigious Women's Prize for Fiction. I relished the convincing Georgian world it created but I can't help feeling a little disappointed at the meandering story. Nevertheless, it is an engaging, evocative debut and I look forward to whatever the talented Imogen Hermes Gowar does next."}, {"userName": "Gumble's Yard", "userReviewDate": "Mar 02, 2018", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/35482263-gumble-s-yard", "userReview": "UPDATE: I said in my review that the book had a strong chance of success in the Women's Prize, it was subsequently longlisted and has now made the shortlistI spent much of the second half of 2017 and early 2018 reading experimental fiction: the Goldsmith shortlist; various books I had anticipated making that list; each of the Republic of Consciousness Prize longlist at least twice; a number of other books submitted for that prize; other books from the wonderful small presses that I discovered through the prize. Fiction that was brilliant but still often demanding of the reader.It is therefore a great pleasure to find a book that, while still excellently written is instead generous to the reader, one that simply weaves a good, old-fashioned story around a great command of language and evocative period detail, one that seamlessly weaves bawdy descriptions and dialogue (particularly in the first part), alongside the harsh realities of prostitution (even if it is high class prostitution) and female servitude (particularly in the second part), with a deeply affecting and melancholic third part. This story set in London and its outskirts (particularly Deptford) in 1785, starts with a merchant, ship owner and childless widower John Hancock finding that one of his captains has sold one of his ships for the apparent dead body of a goblin-like mermaid. Initially convinced he faces ruin Hancock decides to exhibit it as a marvel in a local coffee house, to his surprise to great success and is then persuaded by a high class madam \u2013 Mrs Chappell - to allow her to exhibit the mermaid alongside her girls. At the first evening she asks one of her ex-girls, Angelica Neal, a courtesan whose Duke-lover recently died without remembering her in his will, to entertain Hancock, only for Hancock, despite being smitten with Angelica, to flee when he realises the explicit nature of the other entertainments laid on at the party. The second part of the book mainly traces the fortunes of Angelica and those around her, fortunes which turn rapidly against her and from which she is rescued by marriage to Mr Hancock (who responding to some teasing of hers, becomes obsessed with finding another mermaid for her). To his astonishment he succeeds but, the third part of the book, turns to fantasy as the mermaid turns out to be ephemeral if bewitching when viewed, but to be deeply affecting emotionally, infecting those around it with a deep lying sense of ennui and loss.Another strong part of the book is the number of very strong female side-characters it develops \u2013 Bel Fortescue (Angelica\u2019s best friend who succeeds in marrying her own upper class lover), Hancock\u2019s niece Sukie, Mrs Chappell herself, Polly a mulatto in Mrs Chappell\u2019s group of girls, Mrs Frost (Neal\u2019s housekeeper, seemingly full of disapproval of Angelica\u2019s lifestyle but who is all the time learning and developing what it would take to set up her own house of girls) \u2013 interestingly many, particularly Bel and Polly drift away from the story (or more accurately the story drifts away from them) but stay in the readers mind as fully formed characters. I suspect that this strong group of characters give this book a good chance of success with the Women\u2019s Prize for fiction and already it must be a strong contender for next year\u2019s Costa First Novel Prize.Overall a really enjoyable read \u2013 just what I needed and has set me up nicely for a return to the more experimental end of literature."}, {"userName": "Eric Anderson", "userReviewDate": "Apr 22, 2018", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/28819314-eric-anderson", "userReview": "What a joy it was reading this novel! And I'm so glad I purposely saved it as the last book to read from The Women's Prize longlist. I had a hunch it'd be a pleasurable and immersive story and it was. It's the kind of book I was eager to get back to every time I had to put it down which is something I can't say about some other literary novels no matter how clever or interesting they are. Given how much I enjoyed reading both Imogen Hermes Gowar's debut novel and \u201cThe Parentations\u201d I'm beginning to think my favourite kind of historical fiction has a dash of the supernatural mixed in with it. Although, to be honest, \u201cThe Mermaid and Mrs Hancock\u201d is almost entirely firmly grounded in reality. The mermaid element comes to stand for something more emotional and rooted in the real world later in the novel. It's primarily the story of a widower businessman whose livelihood is at stake when his merchant vessel is unwittingly traded away and a high society escort/prostitute named Angelica Neal who is reentering her trade after the death of a duke that kept her and left her nothing. Their stories collide in a richly imagined version of late-18th century London with its bawdy houses of ill repute and emerging middle class neighbourhoods.

This is my ninth book read in the Women's Prize for Fiction longlist.A merchant comes into far more fortune than he could have ever perceived owning, but with it comes the realisation of the extent of his own happiness and just how much his new situation can alter it. A courtesan experiences a change in circumstance that sees her once again thrust upon society, but she then is faced with the dawning understanding of her inability to take charge of her own destiny and design a life of her own choosing. And it is the corpse of an infant mermaid, maliciously featured and peculiar in design, that draws these disparate characters into a twist of fortunes none could ever previously have anticipated. This was such a strange and bizarre story, and yet, in other respects, it wasn't strange and bizarre at all. Given the fantastical sounding title, I was anticipating the mermaid in question to have more of a larger focus in the story. The presence of such an entity was what directed the characters to interact and for events to unfold as they did, without the mermaid in question actually featuring much at all. Initially, I was awaiting for a diversion from reality and a return to the fantastical but I soon became immersed in the world and the intricate everyday lives of those who lived there.This provided a fascinating historical insight with the lightest sprinkling of the otherworldy and delivered a resonating story-line which exuded emotion and enthralled me much more than any mermaid alone could have done.I received a copy of this book in exchange for an honest review.

It\u2019s the best book I\u2019ve read this year so far, and probably one of my all time favourites. For full review, please visit my blog: https://umutreviews.wordpress.com/201...First, let me put a disclaimer. If you don\u2019t enjoy slow moving books and character driven stories, maybe this is not for you. Mermaid and Mrs. Hancock is a historical fiction that has mesmerising language, amazing atmospheric setting, lots of metaphors and character building. It moves slowly, not action packed at all, but the writing is just beautiful. So, if you picked it up and not a reader of this sort, I\u2019m sorry your 2 stars doesn\u2019t count \ud83d\ude42Now my favourite part. I will rave about the things I loved:1. I really enjoyed the atmospheric setting. The story is set in 18th century in England, and I felt I was there. She described the society setting fantastically as well. The problems women face, hypocrisy, how trapped they are in men\u2019s world, racial difficulties which were even worse that time, etc. There are many layers in her setting that I love.2. Characters: The main characters in the book are Mr. Hancock and Angelica Neal. But, that\u2019s not all. There are many others who are really interesting, adds to the story, developed very well. But, I can only congratulate the author for how she built the two main characters. As it\u2019s a character driven novel, it was really important.3. Beautiful writing: The writing was really exquisite. Very detailed and vivid settings. very deep character building. She portrayed the picture of the society of those times through metaphors and amazing characters so well. I enjoyed every sentence. Also, it was clear there\u2019s a lot of research behind this to display the true features of the times.4. Tone of voice: Although it was a slow moving book, I LOVED the tone of voice. It was bright, uplifting and witty. The characters were really interesting and different.I loved the book, but of course there were gaps to mention as well:1. I thought inclusion of some small characters like Bel or Polly didn\u2019t add value to the story much. Also, there was not enough time to go through their stories properly. So, it felt rushed to open and close their chapters. I\u2019d rather she omitted these and made the book shorter. It would be more crisp. There were enough characters to carry the story.2. The tone of voice of the book was really bright up until last quarter of the book. At that point, we took a sharp turn dropping the mood and going in a more depressive tone of voice. I found this very sudden, and I wished it was a smoother change.3. Lastly, the end felt a bit rushed. I read that people were really surprised and disliked the end. I\u2019m not on that camp. I did like the end because I believe the author tried to symbolise something (I don\u2019t want to spoil it for you!). But, I felt we rushed towards the end because at that point the book was very long anyway. So, I think if there weren\u2019t these little characters that didn\u2019t add much, we could have a smoother transition to the end and take a bit more time there.Regardless, I really really enjoyed my time reading this book. I actually both read my copy and listened to the audio book. I must say I quite disliked the voice on the audio book (Audible). So, I cannot recommend that, but the book is superb!"}, {"userName": "Rachel", "userReviewDate": "Apr 23, 2018", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/3965659-rachel", "userReview": "The Mermaid and Mrs. Hancock, a historical novel set in 1780s London, follows Jonah Hancock, a merchant who finds himself in possession of a mermaid, and Angelica Neal, a courtesan whose protector has recently died. Their narratives intersect rather early on, and the novel mostly follows their relationship over a rather meandering 500 pages.From the very first page, I wanted to love this book. I was struck instantly by Imogen Hermes Gowar's prose, which is some of the best I think I've ever read in a contemporary novel. It's poised, elegant, classical and lyrical all at once, with some of the most evocative setting descriptions I've ever read. Gowar brings the late 1700s to life in a way that I wouldn't dare to minimize as I go on to discuss this novel's flaws.But I would be remiss not to mention that the pace and plotting were downright maddening. This is one of those books where nothing happens for 450 pages, and then everything happens in the last 50. It's uneven, and for me, it wasn't engaging enough to hold my attention throughout. Characters and their motivations also remained at arm's length, with a questionable third person omniscient point of view which gave absolutely no rhyme or reason for its head hopping, following not only Jonah and Angelica, but a handful of other characters whose narratives were never fully developed. One of these characters in particular was Polly, a black courtesan whose storyline had absolutely no depth or insight or closure or anything remotely satisfying to read.Again, I don't want to downplay what an accomplishment Gowar's writing is. If your main draw to a novel is rich, gorgeous prose, then I wouldn't hesitate to recommend this. But if you're looking for tight plotting and compelling characters, I can't say that either of those is a real strength of this novel.Thank you to Harper and Imogen Hermes Gowar for the advanced copy provided in exchange for an honest review."}, {"userName": "Meike", "userReviewDate": "Mar 25, 2018", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/59050228-meike", "userReview": "Nominated for the Women\u2019s Prize for Fiction 2018 The German version of this book is published by Bastei in its division \u201cBastei Entertainment\u201d \u2013 and the book is entertaining indeed! First-time novelist Imogen Hermes Gowar takes the reader to 18th century London with a tale about the ambivalent relation between ambition and happiness. When Jonah Hancock, a humble merchant, is presented with a dead mermaid by one of his captains, he decides to first put the corpse on display and later sell it, thus making a fortune with his novelty item. But to win the heart of the famous courtesan Angelica Neal, he needs to bring her a mermaid of her own \u2013 and when her ambition is fulfilled, the consequences are not what both of them expected. Hermes Gowar does a great job evoking the atmosphere of the time: The sights, the smells, the noises, the clothes, the manners. The reader really gets immersed in the story, and the characters, while not necessarily multi-faceted, are interesting and fun to accompany through the story. Together with the chronological narration and straight storyline, it turns this book into a light read \u2013 entertainment, as promised. To me, the most fascinating aspect was the symbol of the mermaid: It never becomes entirely clear whether the dead creature was indeed a mermaid, and the second mermaid, said to be caught alive, seems to be some kind of a chimera \u2013 a fleeting idea more than a creature, an ambition that was willed into a subject of its own, but which falls apart as soon as the hopes invested in it do not materialize. And isn\u2019t it a common thing to think: Once I achieve X, I will be so much happier? Turns out, often we don\u2019t. What bothered me a little is that this striking idea of the mermaid was not as sharply executed as it could have been, and that the motivations of some characters, especially when they changed their minds, did not become entirely clear to me. Why does Mr. Hancock want to win over Angelica Neal in the first place, for instance?

As a fan of historical fiction, I was excited that Imogen Hermes Gowar has chosen to set her tale in the 18th century London and her description of the town and its people is colourful, atmospheric and drew me right in. The story is sold as a mix of historical fiction with magical realism and yes, there is some magical realism but that really only occurs at the end of the book (as in the last 15%) and is what ultimately brought this book down a little bit for me, as it felt slightly crammed in and rushed. Overall, I have to say though, that I thoroughly enjoyed this book, the characters have followed me around and when I was not reading the book I was thinking about it. I thought, the author did a good job in describing the diversity in 18th century London, especially with slaves from the former American colonies settling in London after the American Independence. However, it also felt that it was in there because it wanted to be diverse, but this did not matter to me, because it is important to demonstrate that history is not just white. Some people may not like the very descriptive and explicit sex scenes at the beginning of the book, but the tone changes throughout as Angelica Neale's life changes, again, I thought the author did that very well.

There\u2019s Angelica, the beautiful, capricious, independent-minded courtesan who\u2019s unfortunately insufficiently financially independent not to be in need of a new protector. There\u2019s the procuress to high society and Angelica\u2019s erstwhile employer, Mrs Chappell, a somewhat grotesque figure but one who possesses an acute eye for business. \u2018Mrs Chappell is there to greet him, a vast toad in white linen, her stubby arms outstretched and her legs churning up her skirts as she paddles across the gleaming floor.\u2019 There\u2019s clever, organised Sukie, Mr Hancock\u2019s niece, who\u2019s been made to feel \u2018a spare daughter\u2019 in her mother\u2019s large household and wonders about her future. \u2018Sukie\u2019s secret ambition is to marry a gentleman in possession of s good trade but poor health, who will die very shortly after the children are born and leave her be.\u2019 And there\u2019s young Polly, whose dark skin makes her merely a valuable novelty for the men who patronise Mrs Chappell\u2019s establishment.However, my favourite character and the most sympathetic figure in the book to my mind is Jonah Hancock. Widowed in tragic circumstances, he\u2019s all too aware of his responsibilities to support his sister\u2019s mighty brood. Jonah is seized with the desire to better himself and it is in pursuit of this that he is persuaded to take the uncharacteristic step of putting the strange object he has unexpectedly acquired on public display. What follows will bring him wealth and fame but also contact with elements of society that are totally outside of his previous experience.Above all, Jonah is lonely. \u2018Mr Hancock returns to his own doorstep, where no wife stands with her arms outstretched to him, and no children buzz with their observations of the day.\u2019 He feels particularly keenly the sadness of having no child to make everything he\u2019s achieved seem worthwhile. \u2018If he leaves nothing, who can say he lived at all?\u2019 When he sets eyes on Angelica he is immediately captivated, although they seemingly have little in common. Perhaps his life may take a different path, a path which he had long ago given up hope of?The book has a fantastic period atmosphere reminiscent of that created by Francis Spufford in Golden Hill. The sights, sounds and tastes of 18th century London are conjured up so the reader feels immersed in the period. \u2018Syllabubs on cold slates; liqueur-flavoured jellies, and strawberries and melons and millefruits; and a great heaped centrepiece of butter-yellow pineapples, whose flesh both fresh and roasted perfumes the room.\u2019 And there\u2019s a touch of another \u2018Hill\u2019 \u2013 Fanny Hill by John Cleland \u2013 in some of the bawdy scenes at Mrs Chappell\u2019s \u2018entertainments\u2019.There\u2019s some brilliantly witty writing and dry humour. \u2018It happens that a gentleman named Mr Brierley is one day caught in flagrante with this horse-boy, or some say his horse, but either way such prurient interest in the dealings of strangers has no place in this story. It only signifies at all because after this Mr Brierley hanged himself, the extent of his debts was revealed, and his widow put his house and all its contents up for sale for a very reasonable price.\u2019Amid the lively atmosphere of high society taking its pleasures, there are darker undertones. There is a reminder that the gilded cage in which Mrs Chappell\u2019s \u2018ladies\u2019 reside is a form of imprisonment and that their lives could be transformed for the worse in a moment. In fact, being trapped by one\u2019s gender, class, race, financial situation or even marital status emerges as a theme of the book. There are other messages as well: that you should be careful what you wish for, that you should count your blessings and that what you think you crave above all things may not bring you the happiness you believe \u2013 in fact, just the opposite. \u201cTo be content as best we can must be enough for us.\u201d Perhaps contentment is all anyone needs.I absolutely loved this book with its cast of colourful characters, its exquisite period detail and engaging story line. It\u2019s a long time away, but this will go straight on my list of books I\u2019ll tip to make The Walter Scott Prize for Historical Fiction longlist in 2019. And, I\u2019ll bet that\u2019s not the only literary prize list it ends up on either.I received an advance reader copy courtesy of NetGalley and publishers, Vintage, in return for an honest review."}, {"userName": "Emma", "userReviewDate": "Nov 09, 2017", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/50370833-emma", "userReview": "First of all, I'd like to thank Netgalley and the publisher for providing me with an ARC of this book in exchange for an honest review.I don't think I've ever read a book that was so thoroughly not for me in my life. I really struggled to get through the pages - it took me well over a month to read, even though I've been known to read books of equal length in two days flat - and I just never warmed to it at all.I'll start with the good points, just to get them out of the way - firstly, the author's writing style is admittedly lovely, and does a very good job of evoking the era, the places and the characters depicted. However, even the writing rang a bit hollow to me at times - it was a bit like a courtesan's glamour, all frothy, pretty little turns of phrase which cleverly disguised the lack of any underlying substance.The premise of the whole book is based around the relationship that kindles between one of London's most famous courtesans and a staid middle-aged merchant, and the mermaid that unexpectedly enters the latter's possession. A note to any fans of fantasy (like me) who are tempted to pick this book up because the mention of a mermaid intrigues you: don't. The mermaid barely features, and the elements of magical realism are severely underused in general; they only really have an effect on the last 20% or so of the book, and barely at that, fizzling into nothing in the last few pages.I also found it almost impossible to connect with any of the characters in this novel. While I was pleased by how many of the characters were women, I'm utterly sick of fiction in which women are constantly at each other's throats. Meanwhile, the two main characters' romance was surprisingly tolerable, and one quiet scene between them early in their relationship was actually one of my favourite scenes in the whole novel, but I found both of the characters themselves unbearably insipid. The narrative also dipped into the side characters' stories fairly often, almost randomly, and in most cases without any satisfying resolution. I actually found several of the side characters more interesting than the main characters - Sukie and Polly were probably my favourites, and I hated how neither of them got any real narrative resolution. In fact, the entire plot just kind of ambled along with no real drive or cohesion throughout the whole book.Finally, the book seemed to be trying to make a point about women's place in society, but utterly unable to actually figure out what that point might be, and it was even clumsier when trying to comment on historical race relations, which made a couple of scenes downright uncomfortable to read. All in all, not my cup of tea at all, and not a book I'll be recommending."}, {"userName": "Jonathan Pool", "userReviewDate": "May 30, 2018", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/27950748-jonathan-pool", "userReview": "It can\u2019t be easy to write a novel set in the c.18th and to capture the language of the times, and the atmosphere. I thought Imogen Hermes Gowar did a great job and wrote very well, with a superb vocabulary of unusual words.It is very Dickensian in its portrayal of character- but that\u2019s not a bad thing.Ill repute is defended; those struggling to make a living indulge in the oldest profession, for the most part, without shame.In particular the \u201cexperienced\u201d ladies of the lower society are excellent:Mrs Elizabeth Chappell and Bel Fortescue.Every walk of life has a hierarchy and as one of the girls observes\u2018It\u2019s what makes you a courtesan and not a jade \u201c(40)Although the timeframe is a throwback (to 1785), the essential requirement to be seen, and to display ostensible wealth, is not so different to the whirl of celebrities who attend first nights, and product launches today.Who says opposites can\u2019t work. The combination of Mr Jonah Hancock and Angelica Neal works beautifully.As for Mermaids; they are capricious - sirens who will resist domestication!!!I came to this book as a result of its short listing in the 2018 Women\u2019s Prize. I don\u2019t think it has the necessary gravitas to emerge as the winner, but it\u2019s a lovely and funny book with large characters and unlikely storylines.

Now, this book is not as focused on the mermaid as you might think from the blurb but take the mermaid as a mystery in the background which draws the world of traders and courtesans together then you have the full focus of a historically intriguing read.The author has a knack for evoking London of the 1700s. The ships in the dock, the stench of the streets, the glamour of the courtesans, the theatres and then there\u2019s the mermaid. Such a discovery and a source of amazement. Pineapple was hailed as a new wonder at the time so the mermaid takes their breath awayThe mermaid is the link between two worlds - fact and fiction, rich and poor, man and woman, the world of business and that of make believe. From this wonder, the romance between two very different characters swims between two worlds not linked until now.The mermaid is not just a creature of intrigue, it\u2019s a symbol for so much more. How London was changing, people within and how the world was becoming smaller with ships exchanging goods from one world to the other, and the people in it players in the theatre of its day.This isn\u2019t a fantasy novel about a mermaid as the blurb suggests, but an insight into a world where marvel and mystery was opening up, knocking down borders, bringing new cultures and foods to new markets and the marvels of what can happen when two worlds collide, and the awe and mystery of a mermaid cast into a love affair with magic at its heart."}, {"userName": "Cendaquenta", "userReviewDate": "Mar 17, 2018", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/75825072-cendaquenta", "userReview": "Lovely book outside and in. Not the heaviest on plot, more of a character piece, and to its credit the characters are all very interesting, if not entirely likeable.

Gowar does tackle some interesting topics but ultimately this book did not meet my expectations. I didn't hate it but I also didn't love it - I was just disappointed with it. The plot and pacing were its main problems but there were other issues as well. This story takes too long to get to the point and then, the conclusion feels rushed - too rushed for my liking - and not all characters and subplots are handled well. By the time we get to Volume III, Gowar drops some of the characters and their subplots to give all her attention to a big element that comes into the narrative and then, in less than 20 pages or so, she tries to wrap all elements. For me it felt as if Gowar was trying to do too much. All that being said, Gowar can definitely write and I think she's an author to keep an eye on."}, {"userName": "Vivek Tejuja", "userReviewDate": "Feb 09, 2018", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/2354484-vivek-tejuja", "userReview": "The year is 1785 and merchant Jonah Hancock has to cope with the tragic news that one of his captains has sold his ship in exchange for a mermaid. Sounds intriguing, isn\u2019t it? I was sold at this premise. But wait a minute. There is more to this story which is more fascinating to me. The side story of Angelica Neal that quickly comes to fore. Neal is London\u2019s most beautiful courtesan who wants to marry rich and secure a future for herself. And who better than Mr. Hancock who has a mermaid to be put on display and make easy money? And all of this is possible through Mrs. Chappell\u2019s brothel (there is more to what meets the eye really) and given she has a soft spot (or so it seems) for Angelica. Phew! That is not it by the way. There is a lot more going on in the book and let me tell you, that despite its size (500 pages), this is one racy romp of a read. There is a lot of decadence in this book (which I love by the way), there is misery, power, envy and fantasy. If not for the mermaid angle, I would classify this book purely as historic fiction, but let the two merge and work its magic on the reader. Also, might I add the magic of London (and its claustrophobia, its stench, lecherous men and grotesque women) is brought out beautifully by Gowar. Angelica Neal\u2019s character is so strong that she overpowers everyone else (in some bits and parts) and in a very good way because you\u2019d want her to appear more as the book progresses. There is also a surprise in the form of Polly but I won\u2019t ruin it for you by talking about her. You might want to discover her yourself. \u201cThe Mermaid and Mrs. Hancock\u201d is set in a vivid and uproarious time. It is the kind of book that must be read again and more than anything for its female characters that stand out and well-deservedly at that. Mrs. Chappell, Angelica and Polly (there is also Mr. Hancock\u2019s niece who makes a brief appearance) are the heroes of this book in all honesty. This is the kind of book that will keep you up all night and you wouldn\u2019t want it any other way. \u201cThe Mermaid and Mrs. Hancock\u201d is all rolled into one \u2013 a comfort read (yes, at most times) and a thriller, literary fiction with the much-needed historic setting."}, {"userName": "Kate", "userReviewDate": "Jan 20, 2018", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/5737182-kate", "userReview": "This remarkable debut, set in the mid 1780s, brings Georgian London alive, or at least those parts of it that make their living, or take their pleasure, in its fashionable 'nunneries' or brothels.
