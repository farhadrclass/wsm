Laugh in the face of fear, in the face of what scares you the most.It's the only way to get you through the things that bring you to tears.\u201d\n\n\u2028The Bet is one of those books that brought the laughs. If you\u2019re looking for something light and easy that will keep a smile on your face, this would be a good one to pick up. This is a story about childhood best friends Kacey and Jake. But it\u2019s not just about them. Jake\u2019s older brother, Travis is in the mix. You see Jake and Kasey were always best friends, even dated for a while, but Travis is the guy who\u2019s always cared for Kacey. She just didn\u2019t know it. Travis and Kacey\u2019s relationship as children/teens was less than sweet and loving. They picked on each other in a good natured way. Kacey has been away from the Titus boys for a while, but when Jake needs her help with a \u2018fake engagement\u2019 he makes her an offer she can\u2019t refuse\u2026.I was so confused the first bit of this book. I had no idea if I was supposed to like Jake or hate him. I wasn\u2019t sure if I was supposed to love Travis, or if Jake was the one who would get his act together and steal Kacey\u2019s heart. At first I thought\u2026 love triangle? Really? But by the end you realize there was never any competition. One man truly cares for and loves Kacey and one doesn\u2019t. Not the way she deserves anyway. All these characters were great in different ways, but there was one that stood out above the rest. The grandma. She was fun, spunky, and laugh out loud funny. I really want to read the next book just to get more grandma! I listened to the audio version and it was one of those cases where I think it was more enjoyable in audio than reading. The narration was great, you could tell the narrators were really getting into the story and that\u2019s always fun! Sometimes you just need a light read to listen to that will make you laugh and smile. If you\u2019re looking for a hilarious, quirky and sweet romance, this is one I\u2019d recommend!"}, {"userName": "Lisa Jayne", "userReviewDate": "Mar 31, 2013", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/11963959-lisa-jayne", "userReview": "5 I LOVE THIS BOOK STARS.I, Lisa Jayne Woodward formally declare that I'm a self-confessed book butterfly junkie, sign me up for RA (romance anonymous). Failing that leave me in a padded cell with a shoot for food and this book to read over and over again. This has to be crowned best book of 2013 for me so far. It ticked all my romance story boxes and here are my thoughts ...What's it all about?Kacey is approached by her childhood friend, now millionaire Jake Titus who asks her to return to their childhood home and pretend they are engaged for the sake of his ill grandmother. It's been years since Kacey has even ventured home or seen the Titus Brothers but she is ready to do anything for the sake of this elderly lady. Kacey has a history with Jake's older brother Travis they have a somewhat shaky past and she has never been able to forget the way he teased and taunted her. But when they meet again, sparks fly between these sworn enemies leaving Kacey more confused than ever. Only trouble is Kacey is supposed to be engaged to Jake. A series of hot encounters ensue and a whole host of miscommunication, secrets and unrequited love explodes when this couple meet again.What did I love?'The Bet' boasts the best ever prologue, with a start like that one I knew that I would fall helplessly in love with this story. It has a cute love triangle vibe which is low on the angst with a romance filled healthy dose of heart-in-mouth style Unrequited love. I loved the Sibling rivalry, these brothers will demand you to fall head over in love with them. The Titus brothers are utterly Devine. Jake and Travis were both amazing characters but there is only one brother for me and that's Travis, he is completely dreamy and I could not get enough of this authors ability to write loveable characters.The hero and heroine are obvious candidates for forever sweethearts, a romance book can't host too much sweet for my reading taste and this book delivers. I can't possibly talk about what I loved without mentioning Grandma, she is one crazy, loveable granny and had me laughing out loud at her antics. Rachel Van Dyken knows how to write swoon worthy heart stopping, likeable stories. Here we have an amazing hero and a Funny, likeable 'I want to be best mates with this girl' heroine. 'The bet' is all of the above packed into four hours of true happiness and out there fabulous reading. Final thoughts ...I loved every Page of this book, if you love laugh out loud funny, book butterfly sexy, and books so sweet you may be put in a glucose overdose coma, this will be your next favourite read. I could not get enough of these characters, this is what romance is made of, I'm in complete book heaven. Go grab it romance junkies, enjoy ... Kisses.\n*Anna Champion, my book bestie I owe my butterflies to your recommendation.

All he had to do was cause the trouble and then save her from it.\nChar was the truest type of friend. When Kacey cried, Char cried. When Kacey threatened to kill Jake, Char offered to pay for a hit man, and when Kacey finally moved on and only mentioned Jake as the man who shall not be named, Char went ahead and nicknamed him Bastard for her sake.I wish we saw more of Char~ Her character seemed like someone I would totally love.I hope this book continues and we see more into their lives, the ranch life and stuff and the empire Jake's building :P and maybe a baby for all I care! haha :D"}, {"userName": "Kelly (and the Book Boar)", "userReviewDate": "Mar 05, 2016", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/11183856-kelly-and-the-book-boar", "userReview": "Find all of my reviews at: http://52bookminimum.blogspot.com/If you know my history with romance novels, you\u2019ll know I\u2019m not real good at reading them right most of the time.

But as the story progressed, the immaturity of the characters was on full display along with \"cheesy\" dialogue. Having enjoyed all my previous Rachel Van Dyken reads, I persevered through it hoping for the best.Fifteen Years Ago .....Travis, a stuttering eight year old, really likes Kacey and assumes he will marry her one day. After all, he was the oldest and well on his way to becoming a man. His attempts at showing Kacey he likes her always backfires and she ends up running away in tears and hating him.Jake, Travis' six year old brother, likes Kacey too, and makes a bet with Travis that she would be marrying him. They each spit in their hands and shake on the million dollar bet.Present Day .....Kacey is sitting across from the one man she gave her heart to, and he is wanting a huge favor from her. Jake is asking her to fly back with him to their hometown and pretend to be his fianc\u00e9 for the weekend. The bad press coverage (due to the stripper incident) is hurting his career and putting a strain on his relationship with his parents and grandmother. How is she supposed to spend an entire weekend with this Greek God of a man she has always loved and never gotten over? Jake has broken her heart twice, once in high school and again in college. Yet, here she stands, agreeing to his delusional plan, as he puts a three carat diamond ring on her finger. Oh how she wished it wasn't pretend. Jake owns her heart and he is about to break it into a million pieces all over again. Seeing his brother Travis after all these years won't be fun either. They can't stand each other.My summation .....Given the premise of the storyline, this could have been so much better, IMHO. Unfortunately, I had to constantly wince at the twenty-two year and twenty-three year old's childish behavior and silly conversation."}, {"userName": "Serena..

Io mi chiedo sinceramente perch\u00e9 le persone si sveglino, saltino la colazione e tutt\u2019ad un tratto si accenda loro una lampadina che gli suggerisce di scrivere un libro. Ma.. anche no, sai? Non \u00e8 che ora tutti devono farlo.. Ti piace scrivere? Anche a me piacerebbe mangiare nutella e non ingrassare, ma visto che non \u00e8 possibile il nostro rimane un amore platonico. Ordunque.. Perch\u00e9 se io rinuncio alla Nutella (e mi costa, eh) tu \u2013 che non hai una storia che possa fregiarsi di questo nome e soprattutto zero capacit\u00e0 di riportare quelle due idee farlocche che ti ritrovi per iscritto.. Ecco, perch\u00e9 tu dovresti essere uno scrittore?? ARGH!Bene, detto ci\u00f2 passiamo al libro; direi di sorvolare sull\u2019ennesima scelta penosa della copertina italiana, tanto ormai sembra essere una gara a chi sceglie le pi\u00f9 brutte e insignificanti con bonus extra se la donna presa a rappresentare cotanta storia sembra essersi appena fatta una dose massiccia di LSD, con lo sguardo perso nel vuoto che per\u00f2 potrebbe sembrare allo scaltro lettore quello di una donna che riflette sui massimi destini del mondo.. Direi che palesemente la Nord a questo giro ha sbancato proprio!La storia, se cos\u00ec vogliamo chiamarla, fa gi\u00e0 acqua nella trama (ed \u00e8 tutto dire se gli editori non sono riusciti nemmeno a dissimulare qui la presenza di una storia che vale, tipo L\u2019Oreal): Jake, donnaiolo e cazzone miliardario chiede alla sua amica d\u2019infanzia (con cui per\u00f2 non si sentono pi\u00f9 perch\u00e9 la vita \u00e8 brutta e ingiusta gn\u00e8 gn\u00e8 gn\u00e8 gn\u00e8) di far finta di essere la sua fidanzata per un weekend, con tanto di brillocco da 392394384394 carati, per far credere alla sua famiglia (e al consiglio d\u2019amministrazione della sua ricchissima e fichissima azienda di famiglia) di aver messo la testa a posto, di non uscire pi\u00f9 con le spogliarelliste e bon, vissero felici e contenti. Domanda difficile per i nostri ascoltatori: quanti (finti) scrupoli si fa KAcey a dir di s\u00ec e soprattutto.. Quando tempo ci mette a capitolare e ad accettare di fare una cosa simile, nonostante abbia frequentato per anni i genitori e la nonna di Jake e che dunque la conoscono come fosse parte della loro famiglia?\u2026 Bravi, bene: la risposta \u00e8 un paio e dieci minuti. Fa credere al lettore che NOOOOOO la cosa non si pu\u00f2 fare perch\u00e9 Jake CATTIVONE (nonch\u00e9 bastardo egoista) l\u2019ha ferita mortalmente.. Per\u00f2 lei deve finire l\u2019universit\u00e0, ha debiti da pagare.. Cosa vuoi che sia la morale (Ingannare la famiglia che ti ha cresciuto come se ne facessi parte) o l\u2019amor proprio (mi ha spezzato il cuore, ha tradito la mia fiducia, non sar\u00f2 mai pi\u00f9 la stessa,  SONO CALIMERO, PICCOLO E NERO E NESSUNO MI VORRA\u2019 PIU\u2019 BENE, NGUE\u2019 NGUE\u2019 NGUE\u2019) quando si tratta di fare un favore al tuo vecchio e caro amico e soprattutto essere pagata per questo (squallore in 3,2,1\u2026)?Niente e cos\u00ec i due mettono in moto la farsa del fidanzamento e vanno a casa di lui.. Dove ad aspettarli c\u2019\u00e8 Travis. E voi direte.. Chi \u00e8 Travis? Il focoso ex? L\u2019amante mascherato? Il nonno di Heidi?!No, un poraccio rincoglionito che dall\u2019et\u00e0 di otto anni \u00e8 innamorato di Kacey e per farglielo capire le fa i dispetti (tragico. Giuro, un rincoglionito perso) e la \u2018tortura\u2019 tanto che la dolce Kacey lo ha soprannominato \u201cSatana\u201d. Ovviamente a lei prende un coccolone, i due si insultano nemmeno avessero dodici anni (s\u00ec, la maturit\u00e0 del personaggi \u00e8 inesistente. Dicono di avere 22 e 24 anni.. Ma non dategli retta, una mela acerba \u00e8 tranquillamente pi\u00f9 matura di loro tre messi insieme) e il lettore assiste impotente ad una manfrina che grida \u201cDISAGIO\u201d da tutti i pori.A casa di questi deficienti le figure genitoriali non sono tanto meglio di loro e quindi sono cretini tanto quanto loro. Vogliono celebrare il matrimonio la settimana dopo (ma che problema sociale hai di grazia??!) e credono, per un astruso collegamento degli astri che il lettore non pu\u00f2 cogliere che Kacey sia incinta. Insomma, BOOM, l\u2019hanno sparata enorme..Jake, che povero cristo \u00e8 affetto dalla tripla personalit\u00e0, inserisce la personalit\u00e0 macha (dopo averci reso partecipe di mille pippe mentali su come sarebbe stato se non avesse rovinato tutto con lei) e decide che OH, mica pu\u00f2 star dietro a KAcey.. Cio\u00e8, l\u2019ha portata a casa e se la deve pure sorbire? Insomma, prende, lascia la cena coi parenti, smolla la fidanzata e va a far sesso con la focosa SamantHa (l\u2019acca, mi raccomando, altrimenti levate tutta la focosit\u00e0 di questo personaggio che risulta essere piatto come un foglio di carta velina - COME SE INVECE GLI ALTRI BRILLASSERO PER SPESSORE CARATTERIALE EH..), che ha fatto venire direttamente da Seattle (o da dove vivono. Insomma, Samantha con l\u2019acca ha preso l\u2019aereo per vedersi con Jake che non riesce a tenerselo nei pantaloni due giorni); Kacey dunque che altro pu\u00f2 fare, povera crista pure lei, se non rifugiarsi da Travis, la sua NEMESI (lo chiama cos\u00ec. Giuro), che odia con tutto il cuore perch\u00e9 \u00e8 dispettoso e da bambina la faceva sempre piangere (RIUSCITE A SENTIRE IL PATHOS?).. Eh, beh, normale, no? Insomma, vanno in cucina, flirtano, si rimbeccano e:Lui la lasci\u00f2 subito andare. \u00abDai, portiamo di l\u00e0 la torta prima che pensino che mi hai pugnalato.\u00bb \u00abPenserebbero bene\u00bb, borbott\u00f2 lei, anche se non era proprio quello che aveva in mente. Cospargergli il corpo di lamponi e poi leccarli? S\u00ec. Violenza? S\u00ec, ma solo sessuale.\u2026 No words. Perch\u00e9 poi la cosa peggiora, precipita e diventa un nonsense completo:Chiss\u00e0, forse fu solo per la frustrazione, per il desiderio represso, sta di fatto che Kacey si alz\u00f2, si mise a cavalcioni su Travis e spalm\u00f2 la torta sul quel viso splendido, gridando: \u00abAdesso ti prendo!\u00bb In teoria, i Titus avrebbero dovuto ridere, invece rimasero in silenzio.Cio\u00e8, capite? I Titus avrebbero dovuto RIDERE: chi non troverebbe comica la scenetta della fidanzata del figlio che si mette a cavalcioni sull\u2019altro figlio? Ah ah ah, io mi sto scompisciando dalle risate, giuro.Travis si comporta da vecchio scemunito e Kacey, altra ritardata rara, non capisce che sta nascondendo i suoi profondissimi sentimenti e lo reputa uno stronzo.. Fatto sta che bisticciano un altro po\u2019 come due ragazzini a cui il lettore darebbe volentieri una mazzata sui denti e finiscono per vedere un film insieme.Ora, quale espediente ha un povero scrittore per far avvicinare due persone che teoricamente si odiano ma che in realt\u00e0 sono solo troppo cretine per parlare come gli adulti che in realt\u00e0 sono?.. Esatto, un film di paura, cos\u00ec che la donna sola e indifesa possa trovare conforto tra le braccia possenti e scolpite (s\u00ec, perch\u00e9 Travis \u00e8 un figo da paura.. Avevate dubbi??) del maschio alfa. PIETA\u2019.PIETA\u2019 DOPPIA, perch\u00e9 il film scelto dall\u2019autrice, sperando di risultare un sacco simpatica (Ci torno sul suo stile, tranquilli!) \u00e8 nientepopodimeno che.. \u201cAlice nel paese delle meraviglie\u201d, ritenuto spaventosissimo da Kacey per lo stregatto.MA CHE TI DROGHI???Vabb\u00e9, vi lascio cinque minuti per assorbire la cosa e prepararvi all\u2019eclatante colpo di scena successivo che nessuno si sarebbe mai aspettato.. I due si scolano due bottiglie di vino e la passione chiama: baci bollenti e il quasi sesso interrotti dalla nonnina che passa:\u00abTravis! Kacey!\u00bb Nadine si port\u00f2 una mano al cuore. Oddio. Ecco. La nonna lo aveva appena beccato mentre stava per scoparsi la fidanzata di suo fratello. Ci sarebbe rimasta secca. Lo sapeva. \u00abKacey, quel reggiseno \u00e8 davvero carino. Rosa. Dovrei prendermene uno anch\u2019io\u00bb, disse invece la nonna.A questo punto il disagio \u00e8 diventato esistenziale. La Van Dyken prova a buttarla sull\u2019ironia (certo, un\u2019ironia un po\u2019 bacata la sua eh) ma \u00e8 tutto talmente triste e osceno che non ho avuto nemmeno la forza di indignarmi per questi espedienti noti al mondo della critica come \u201callacazzodicane\u201d..Insomma, una cosa tira l\u2019altra, la nonnetta li ha interrotti e il momento \u00e8 sparito: tutti a letto; in quel mentre arriva Jake che ha preso un clamoroso due di picche da Samantha con l\u2019acca perch\u00e9 ella si \u00e8 lamentata di Kacey e quindi non se ne \u00e8 fatto niente.. Tornato in s\u00e9 Jake capisce quanto Kacey sia bella, figa, buona ecc e pensa di riprovarci, va da Kacey, la bacia (e che importa se codesta fanciulla fino a tre minuti prima si \u00e8 spupazzata l\u2019altro fratello) ma viene interrotto da Travis che stile uomo delle caverne si batte il petto e difende l\u2019onore di Kacey e caccia via il fratello; morale della favola Travis e Kacey litigano perch\u00e9 fondamentalmente - e non mi stancher\u00f2 di ripeterlo \u2013 sono due disadattati sociali e pure rincoglioniti e buonanotte a tutti.Il giorno dopo Jake porta Kacey alla riunione delle superiori: tutti circondano Jake di attenzioni, le donne (ingrassate, invecchiate, brutte e acide \u2013 e che importa se hanno 22 anni e non 59.. Solo Jake e Kacey hanno mantenuto il fiore della loro giovent\u00f9) sono il corrispettivo femminile dei morti di figa e si strusciano come farebbe la tipa del permaflex con il materasso a Jake, contentissimo di queste attenzioni.. Kacey, povera, triste anima incompresa, viene salvata da Travis e.. Non ricordo che fanno perch\u00e9 a quel punto ero troppo annoiata per prestare attenzione a \u2018sti due poracci.Arriviamo felici e sereni alla cena, in cui Kacey sente dire a Travis alla madre che loro due si stanno solo divertendo e non c\u2019\u00e8 nulla tra loro (Il povero Trav che prende pali a destra e manca..); Kacey si arrabbia come una faina e decide di fargliela pagare.. Giocano a monopoli in coppia con tutta la famiglia e come al solito i due battibeccano; Travis le porta il t\u00e8 e si scopre poi che.. No, ragazzi tenetevi forte e se siete in piedi sedetevi perch\u00e9 la mia sar\u00e0 una rivelazione tostissima.. SI SCOPRE CHE IL TE NON E\u2019 DETEINATOChe scandalo!!! Ma vi rendete conto??? Sono senza parole, sconvolta, offesa!Kacey ancora pi\u00f9 arrabbiata perch\u00e9 sa che Travis l\u2019ha fatto apposta cos\u00ec che lei non potesse dormire, si precipita nella sua stanza (che \u00e8 in una dependance con ingresso autonomo) e gli afferma che dormir\u00e0 con lui per vendetta.(\u2026 Lo so, vi capisco. Pensate che io l\u2019ho addirittura LETTA questa scena)Dopo le solite manfrine, ecco che i due.. S\u00ec insomma, no? Stanno per. E che succede a questo punto a rovinare la loro pace interiore, dal momento che siamo \u2018solo\u2019 al 70% della storia e se questi due finissero a letto insieme non ci sarebbe pi\u00f9 una storia? La madre arriva e chiede se va tutto bene perch\u00e9 ha sentito dei rumori.ORA. Eravate attenti quando vi ho detto che la stanza si trova in un\u2019ala separata della casa con un ingresso autonomo??? Che diavolo di udito ha la madre per la miseria??A questo punto per\u00f2 \u00e8 palese che la Van Dyken scrive random tutte le idiozie che il criceto nella sua testa le suggerisce senza darsi pena del fatto che abbiano o meno senso. In fondo, se il lettore fino ad ora ci ha creduto,.. Tanto vale continuare sulla strada del nonsense, no?I due si interrompono, lei va a fare la doccia e lui entra senza motivo chiedendo \u201cTutto bene\u201d? (Ma che problemi sociali ha la gente, di nuovo?). Travis inciampa nel perizoma di Kacey e nel cadere strappa via la tenda della doccia lasciando Kacey nuda come un verme.\u2026 HAHAHAAHAHAHHAHAAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAAHAHAHAHAH!!! Ma cos\u2019\u00e8, la candid camera?? Sconvolta.. Anche perch\u00e9 entra tutto il resto della famiglia e nessuno si chiede perch\u00e9 KAcey stia facendo la doccia in camera di Travis quando TECNICAMENTE \u00e8 fidanzata con Jake. Ve la faccio breve, la nonna aveva pensato a tutto e voleva far stare Kacey con Travis perch\u00e9 lui la ama da sempre ma non gliel\u2019ha mai detto; gli lascia 24 ore di tempo a casa da solo con Kacey per \u2018 risolvere\u2019 e qui inizia una nuova fase nonsense della storia: Travis e Kacey (che io vorrei ricordare fino a due giorni prima odiava Travis come se non ci fosse un domani) iniziano a baciarsi sul prato di casa e siccome \u2013 davvero \u2013 era ancora troppo presto succede questo: (Vi riporto la citazione perch\u00e9 una boiata simile dovete leggerla dal vivo)Con un gemito, lui la spinse a terra e le sollev\u00f2 la camicia. \u00abMerda!\u00bb mormor\u00f2. \u00abUh?\u00bb \u00abMaledetta erba del cazzo!\u00bb \u00abChe c\u2019\u00e8?\u00bb Kacey non capiva. Perch\u00e9 Travis se la prendeva con l\u2019erba? E soprattutto perch\u00e9 aveva smesso di baciarla? \u00abSono allergico all\u2019erba!\u00bb esclam\u00f2, alzandosi a sedere.\u2026Piet\u00e0 e misericordia!! Vabb\u00e9, c\u2019\u00e8 tutta una parte patetica troppo noiosa da raccontarvi (ma vi lascio qualche chicca nelle citazioni) quindi andiamo al sodo: FINALMENTE i due fanno sesso (ed \u00e8 ovviamente bellissimo, stupendo, incredibile e via dicendo) e Kacey se ne esce con: \u201cTi amo\u201d (s\u00ec, il famoso innamoramento da weekend. E che tocca fa\u2019). Travis viene preso alla sprovvista perch\u00e9 dopo tutti gli anni di ammmmore incondizionato verso Kacey non gliel\u2019ha detto per primo e si chiude in bagno (\u2026).E\u2019 il panico perch\u00e9 KAcey sta rivivendo la stessa scena vissuta con Jake ed ecco il GRNDE segreto e il \u201cgn\u00e8 \u00e8 brutto e cattivo e mi ha devastato\u201d: i due al college hanno fatto sesso e poi Jake ha tirato la corda. S\u00ec, ok, non \u00e8 il massimo, ma ripigliati dai.. Nemmeno ti avesse tradito o.. Che ne so, lasciato sull\u2019altare!Dopo una serie di scene rocambolesche (ma tu, tu scaltro lettore, avrai capito che si tratta di scene patetiche e raffazzonate alla meglio) i due si ritrovano, si amano, tutto chiarito e AMEN.\u2026Ma che storiaccia assurda e infame \u00e8??! Oltre a questa povert\u00e0 di trama lo stile della Van Dyken \u00e8 uno dei PEGGIORI che io abbia mai avuto il dispiacere di incontrare in un libro; cio\u00e8, fa davvero davvero schifo!! Innanzi tutto un\u2019ironia becera che ti fa muovere sulla sedia in preda ad un forte attacco di disagio puro (dai ce l\u2019avete presente.. Come quando in sala cade il gelo dopo che qualcuno ha detto qualcosa di inappropriato) e che non fa ridere per niente; ha cercato di creare un personaggio figo come quello della nonna, ma a me ha trasmesso solo squallore, altroch\u00e9! Ma poi anche la costruzione della frase, i dialoghi, il.. TUTTO. Probabilmente il mio pupillo 13enne saprebbe scrivere un po\u2019 come lei (male eh, i suoi temi mi fanno dannare :D).La Van Dyken purtroppo aveva mezza idea in testa e invece che scriverci un racconto breve (che avrebbe letto tra i suoi amici E BASTA) ha voluto fare il salto di qualit\u00e0 con un romanzo e quindi \u2013 essendo limitata- ha usato 283844848348383 volte l\u2019espediente del deus ex machina: ogni volta che Travis e Kacey stanno per far sesso o si stanno avvicinando e risolvendo le loro infantili e infinite discussioni, interviene un elemento esterno di disturbo che definirlo ridicolo \u00e8 fargli un complimento. A volte la storia non sembra essere un romance ma anzi, sembra che il lettore sia stato catapultato all\u2019interno di un libro di fantascienza.. Per la miseria non sono credbili quelle cose!! (Vedasi la madre che arriva nel cuore della notte a chiedere se va tutto bene pur dormendo mooolto distante da l\u00ec o Travis il rincoglionito che inciampa su un perizoma e ruzzola fino a strappare la tenda della doccia\u2026) Io come lettrice mi sono sentita un po\u2019 insultata da questa demenza xDI personaggi sono cos\u00ec piatti e insulsi che non vale la pena nemmeno parlarne; giusto di Kacey mi piacerebbe spendere due paroline: Kacey \u00e8 bella, stupenda, infinita.. Ma non fa altro che sminuirsi; \u00e8 LAGNOSA (fastidiosamente lagnosa), cretina (ma vabb\u00e9, sembra essere appannaggio delle protagoniste di questi libri-fotocopia) e, cosa ancora pi\u00f9 sconcertante.. CATTIVA: Travis tir\u00f2 un pugno al tavolo, mettendo fine alla conversazione. \u00abScusate, credevo di aver visto un insetto.\u00bb Kacey inarc\u00f2 un sopracciglio. \u00abDavvero? Io non ho visto niente.\u00bb \u00abC\u2019era\u00bb, replic\u00f2 lui a denti stretti. \u00abSicuro che non te lo sei immaginato? In fondo conosciamo tutti il tuo amore per gli amici immaginari. Prendi per esempio il coniglietto. Dormi ancora con lui?\u00bb Travis fece un sorriso tirato. \u00abNon lo so, Kacey, tu ti succhi ancora il pollice?\u00bb Lei strinse le palpebre. \u00abPer\u00f2, che risposta matura. Dimmi, ti provi ancora le battute nella mente per non balbettare o non ne hai pi\u00f9 bisogno?\u00bb Sapeva di aver toccato un nervo scoperto.\u00abE, Travis, hai fatto pip\u00ec nei pantaloni?\u00bb \u00abCerto, mamma, come no. Ho ventiquattro anni ma me la sono fatta addosso. Ma ti pare?\u00bb \u00abScusa, caro, \u00e8 solo che sembra proprio che...\u00bb Indic\u00f2 i suoi pantaloni e arross\u00ec. \u00abE poi mi ricordo che quand\u2019eri piccolo...\u00bb Oh, no. \u00abQuand\u2019era piccolo cosa?\u00bb chiese Kacey, incuriosita. \u00abOh, gli capitava a volte di bagnare il letto e di fare brutti sogni, niente di che.\u00bb Kacey s\u2019illumin\u00f2. \u00abAh, be\u2019, ma immagino che il coniglietto con cui dormiva gli fosse di grande conforto durante quelle notti difficili.\u00bb \u00abConiglietto?\u00bb domandarono Jake e il padre all\u2019unisono.Al di l\u00e0 di quanto male sono scritte le scene.. A me non hanno fatto ridere. Ma proprio per niente. Kacey, sei davvero una stronza cattiva, non so come altro definirti!!!AAAHH, Il momento migliore di tutti!!

I was going to say that Jake was plain nasty because he pays strippers and prostitutes for sex and fuck knows what STD's he has. THEN I thought, 'hang on I read books were the heroine is a stripper or prostitute', I root for her and have never wondered what STD's she may have or thought that the hero in those books is nasty for wanting a relationship with her. You see my point?! And even though I've realized that, I still don't like Jake for doing it. Here's another thing - I had to check the blurb for this book several times because we kept getting Jake's POV. I wondered what the hell was going on - was this a story about a man whore turning himself around for the heroine or was it a story were she falls for the 'love of her life's' brother? Why do we need to read about Jake wanting her, not wanting her and also not wanting anyone else to have her. Fuck Jake.Next ... Kacey. She needed to open her fucking eyes and make everyone's life easier by getting 'doormat' tattooed on her forehead (not that it would take anyone long to see). Better yet, she could just FUCK OFF! I hate weak heroines. Everyone could see he didn't want her, I wanted to shout 'HELLO! YOU LOOK LIKE A FUCKING MUPPET, OPEN YOUR EYES'.Travis. Initially I thought he was near perfect. Strong, determined, lovable. But all he seemed to do was bemoan the fact that he didn't have Kacey and Jake did. Grow a pair already and TALK to her properly.To summarise -Kacey needs a backbone.Travis needs some balls.And Jake needs to move to a tiny island were his next girlfriend will never have to meet any of his ex-sex partners (because there is an infinite list of them).DNF at 30%"}, {"userName": "Jennifer", "userReviewDate": "Oct 25, 2017", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/2473504-jennifer", "userReview": "Sweet and sexy with lots of humor and emotion.

Is this what \"NA\" books are? 21 and 23 year olds flailing about, finding love and discovering themselves? If so, this book ain't it.It has the other pre-requisites: heroine orphaned tragically, alone in the world and struggling to finish college; the stunningly gorgeous male lead with a tortured (well, this guy had a stutter. Sort of tragic, no?) past, tons of money and a weird family.Otherwise, it was a standard, run-of-the-mill contemporary romance. Heroine agrees to act a fiancee to the love of her live in order to fool his family and patch up love's career, then runs into love's older brother, who has been in love with HER all of his life. Comedic love triangle and assorted goofy family antics ensue.The problem I had with this (and it's too bad, because otherwise I quite enjoy this trope) was that although the author says her characters are 21 and 23, they don't talk that way, dress that way, have jobs that fit, or, for the most part, act that way. Hero is supposed to be 23, talks like he's 30 and has owned and run a millionaire's ranch for years. WHAT? The ne'er do well brother, who we are told is 21, has taken over his parent's multi-million dollar company, is stalked by paparazzi and tabloid reporters and has been in multiple scandals with strippers. The only believable thing about all of that is the stripper part. The heroine, who is also supposed to be 21, is the only one who remotely acts her age, but certainly talks like a woman in her late 20s.So there was that. And the whole high school thing from my updates. It got to be surreal by 2/3 of the way through the book, and that's when I started skimming.The first half of the book felt as though the characters and story were written to be in their late 20s, early 30s. By the end of the book nothing much was making sense anymore.Well, at least it was free."}, {"userName": "Christine", "userReviewDate": "Apr 07, 2013", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/12933758-christine", "userReview": "Loved it!So why a four star and not a five...well I'll explain in a bit.Kacey's world was turned upside down after a fateful night where she not only loses her best friend but also her parents.Jake has always been Kacey's best friend and protector from not just his older brother who terrorized her as a kid, but also mean teenage girls who did not understand their relationship.Travis (Jake's older brother) has always been behind the scenes and the third wheel to this little equation. He has also been secretly crushing on Kacey since he was eight. A few years later, Kacey gets a random phone call from her once ex-best-friend Jake who is now eccentric millionaire playboy and heir to the Titus throne. After a few bad choices he finds himself backed into a corner and is desperate to find a solution and knows that there is only one person who he can ask for help. Kacey. He offers her a proposition. He asks her to be his pretend fiancee for the weekend and be available for random photo ops. It'll help get the board at Titus off his back for bringing such negative press to their respectable firm, but to also show his parents that he is a responsible mature adult who is capable of commitment. As her reward he will pay off her student loans which will make life so much easier for her.Trouble is Travis her 'arch nemesis' will be present throughout the entire weekend and that is when the story gets...interesting. Ok can I say that I loved this book. After chapter one I was hooked! Could not put it down. Found myself sighing, swooning, grinning and laughing out loud throughout the story. Grandma has got to be the most hilarious grandparent ever! With her cheeky manner, shameless, cunning, manipulative mind, and her live life for the moment philosophy...she was just absolutely perfect! I really enjoyed this book. But you ask, why four and not five? well here's why. I found the ending quite rushed. We reach a climactic point in the story where it gets all heated and interesting and then like a flash it's sorted and then the moments gone. I really do wish there was an Epilogue after the final chapter.

She takes off and doesn't look back. Travis, forever waiting in the wings, felt like he would never get a chance with Kacey.

His father has retired from his multibillion dollar company and now Jake is in charge. Jake's fast and loose lifestyle is not sitting well with the board. So he asks Kasey to go home with him for a weekend and pose a his fiance for the paparazzi. Kasey reluctantly agrees. The only saving grace in her mind is that Travis wont be there to torment her. She arrives at home for the first time since her parents died. She has to face her past. She has to deal with her unresolved feelings for Jake and she has to discover the real reason Travis has tormented her.This book was full of tough topics but was done in a lighthearted and funny way.

Quello almeno Travis lo sapeva: alle ragazze non piacevano i ragazzi. A loro piacevano gli uomini, e lui stava per diventarlo. Gli era perfino cresciuto un pelo sul mento. Se andava avanti cos\u00ec, si sarebbe fatto la barba entro la fine della settimana.Travis a otto anni. Normale amministrazione, no? Si chin\u00f2 ancora di pi\u00f9, facendo guizzare i bicipiti. Gli occhi color nocciola erano fissi in quelli di lei e, quando Jake si pass\u00f2 la lingua sulle labbra, Kacey non ebbe la forza di distogliere lo sguardo. Merda. Sbavava solo a vederlo. Ecco come Jake ha convinto Kacey ad aiutarlo. Ma cosa abbiamo lottato a fare per l\u2019uguaglianza tra uomini e donne..  E cos\u00ec, lo scapolo d\u2019oro di Seattle le aveva appena chiesto di sposarlo. Il matrimonio poteva anche essere fasullo, ma una proposta era pur sempre una proposta. Avrebbe dovuto essere entusiasta.Ma perch\u00e9 avresti dovuto essere entusiasta di una cosa FINTA? Sei scema o cosa? Si erano messi insieme al liceo, ma ben presto avevano capito che funzionavano meglio come amici. O forse il punto era che lui non riusciva a tenerlo nei pantaloni. Probabilmente erano entrambe le cose, ma chi sta con una ragazza sola al liceo?\u2026 Ovvio, no? Travis rimase in silenzio per un po\u2019. Pessimo segno. Voleva dire che di l\u00ec a poco gli sarebbe venuto il mal di testa e avrebbe dato la colpa a Jake.Ma c\u2019\u00e8 una connessione sensata tra il rimanere in silenzio e l\u2019avere mal di testa?!\u00abPorco cane! Questa roba \u00e8 una mer...\u00bbPrincipessa, prego, le deve essere caduta la corona mentre si chinava.. Aveva bisogno di starle lontano e, per riuscirci, doveva comportarsi da stronzo totale. Cos\u00ec almeno non avrebbe rischiato di trovarsi col cuore a pezzi per la seconda volta e, con un po\u2019 di fortuna, anche quello di lei sarebbe rimasto intatto.Almeno aveva portato Kacey a casa per il week end, proprio come aveva promesso. Adesso erano cavoli della nonna. Non suoi. Lui avrebbe trascorso il resto del fine settimana a fare quello che voleva, e non a preoccuparsi di Kacey.Lanci\u00f2 un\u2019occhiata a Kacey. Stava sorridendo a sua madre. Era cos\u00ec che sarebbe diventata la sua vita se si fossero sposati? Non era poi tanto difficile da immaginare. Una bella mogliettina che lo aspettava a casa e un\u2019amante in citt\u00e0. Il sogno americano.Dio, se era stato stupido. Avrebbe dovuto chiederle scusa. O almeno fare qualcosa, qualsiasi altra cosa che non fosse starsene seduto l\u00ec con la testa tra le mani, sul punto di scoppiare a piangere per aver rovinato l\u2019amicizia pi\u00f9 importante della sua vita. Ne era uscito distrutto.E\u2019 sempre Jake che parla. Doppia personalit\u00e0, scelgo te!!\u00abDove vivi?\u00bb \u00abIn un ranch.\u00bb Santo cielo!

Perci\u00f2 non le restava altra scelta che sposare Jake e chiudere un occhio sul fatto che non sapesse tenere il pisello nei pantaloni.Lei ha deciso di partecipare alla farsa, poi le prendono gli scrupoli verso la famiglia con cui \u00e8 cresciuta e quindi.. Ma s\u00ec, sposiamo un tipo random che sembra respirare con il pene.\u00abAh, no. Ci manca solo questo: tu che scavi nel mio passato e prendi in giro tutte le mie ex ragazze. E poi io non esco pi\u00f9 con le ragazze. ESCO CON GLI UOMINI!Esco con le donne.\u00bb La squadr\u00f2 da capo a piedi, quindi lecc\u00f2 piano la forchetta.Ah no, pensavo avremmo assistito al mega colpo di scena gay..

E sudavi.\u00bb \u00abOdio gli orsi.\u00bb Travis si sentiva come se fosse tornato a quando aveva dieci anni e Kacey gli aveva chiesto perch\u00e9 stesse piangendo.

Pure annoyance and irritatingly goody goody & childish. There is no heat, no passion, no desire, no swearing, no lust, no fire.... nothing that would be considered sinful. It's a book you could read at your church picnic.I bet you just looked at the cover again right? Yeah... deceiving. Actually it's nothing like the book. Firstly, there's no passion as the cover suggests. And more importantly, Kacey, who I assume is suppose to be the girl on the cover, actually has dark hair.... I'm going to go and guess that its Travis who is kissing the blonde version of Kacey... Now, well Travis is suppose to be blondish.... so the cover is so far off from the book it's pathetic. Whoever chose the cover / book combination didn't do their homework... Like. At. All! #refundThe characters where hollow. They were absolute freaks. They were 10 year old's disguised as adults. They could actually even be mentally challenged because nothing they said or did made any sense. If there had been a paragraph in the book about how they all gather around and smoke weed every Friday, I may have understood them better.... but no, according to the book they are normal. And that's crazy strange.I'm all for fun banter and tricks up your sleeve. I'm not a prude. But when you put three seriously hot adults together then surely there needs to be some heat in there somewhere - there was none. There was not a single curse word, not a single r-rated moment - Nothing, Nada, None!The Bet lacked personality, it has no grip to keep you hooked, the plot is nonexistent, the 'secret' is so pathetically boring.... It's simply lifeless fiction. I had a horrible, horrible time reading it. I wanted to poke my eyes out just to inject some emotions into my life while I read it. Oh God... I just really didn't like this book at all.I kept reading because I wanted to find the turning point. I really did. The prologue was so good that I just had to hold onto the belief that there must be something resembling some kind of redemption within the pages, but I've now completed it and unfortunately I'm still awaiting. Thank F#%k I didn't hold my breath.And I was having such a winning streak lately with books - I guess my luck has finally run out!If you want spineless men who are completely immature... then this is the book for you.\u2665 \nFor More Reviews Visit My Blog CBL Book Reviews\n\u2665 \nKeep Updated by Liking My Facebook Page"}, {"userName": "Bj", "userReviewDate": "Sep 05, 2014", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/27341466-bj", "userReview": "*I gave this audiobook a B- for both the story and narration at AudioGals*If you love your romances short, cute, sweet, and full of laughs, then The Bet may be a good bet for your next listen. Having previously listened to several books in Ms. Van Dyken\u2019s Eagle Elite series (mafia New Adult), I have to admit that I was expecting something a little different (deeper and more emotionally angst ridden). Nonetheless, in the right frame of mind, The Bet comes off as the classic tale of what happens when two brothers fall in love with the girl next door, except here, it\u2019s riddled with tons of jokes, puns, and crazy laugh-out-loud, off the wall scenarios. As for the narration, with the caveat that it was somewhat difficult to distinguish the two brothers who are the main characters in this story, Tanya Eby otherwise delivers a decent performance.For the full review see AudioGals."}, {"userName": "Shelly Crane", "userReviewDate": "Apr 12, 2013", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/5614044-shelly-crane", "userReview": "Yessss! Loved it!The book was fantastic. And it didn't need to have a sex scene every five minutes to do it! There wasn't really a love triangle either. It sounds like it, but really there's no contest. I won't say who, but I'm sure you can see once you sink into the book. And you need to sink into it. It's got all my favorite things in a book! A swoony guy, a heroine who's NOT a ditsy idiot and someone that I could be friends with, a great family dynamic, a crazy grandma, and it's all about the romance.I was never bored or uninterested. In fact, I neglected my whole family for a whole day for this book. It was great. I hated the villain, I loved the hero and completely felt for them all.

I was terrified of the love triangle aspect, the chance that Jake would pull his head out of his ass and realize that he loved her - that Travis would finally man up and admit that he had teased her so much because he loved her... and then that Kacey would break my heart by picking the one I didn't pick...or not pick either at all.Kacey, Jake and Travis grew up together. Kace & Jake were best friends and Travis was her worst nightmare. At the age where boys are mean to girls they like - he figured she would eventually figure out all the mean things just meant he liked her...well that plan backfired. Fast forward to their twenties and Jake is asking Kacey for a huge favor that will set his disastrous personal life on track in the media - save his chances as CEO of his families company...But Kacey is still reeling from the events that turned their friendship into a distant memory. But returning home to his family, she is willing to put on the show. At least she won't have to see Travis, or Satan as she named him. In the years that have passed, Travis grew up. But the one thing that never changed was his love for Kacey or the fact that he still resorted to childhood teasing.The banter was fun, Grandma was a hoot and the crazy antics these kids recounted throughout the book had me smiling. Kacey struggles with the fact that she has not returned home since her parents died - she has not spent time with Jake - since that night and now she is having feelings for the boy that she spent his youth tormenting her. But Grandma has a plan and they all seem to be falling for it.For those who are worried about love triangles, I feel your pain. I really tried to stay impartial through the first 60% of this book. I hoped that Jake could be redeemed and that somehow he would be less of a douchebag, I expected Travis to grow a pair and then let Kacey fight out her feelings for the two brothers. I was content with waiting it out to the end but it was obvious which one was the right choice, even as I tried to ignore it. This was a very cute story - it had great humor and even some very touching moments that hit that awe spot in in your heart. Finally a book with two guys and one girl that does not have you in knots or full of angst."}, {"userName": "Jen \u2665Star-Crossed Book Blog\u2665", "userReviewDate": "May 31, 2018", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/28353412-jen-star-crossed-book-blog", "userReview": "The Bet was hilariously addicting! I loved that the characters charmed their way into my heart, that the pages were filled with tons of fun drama and that the ending left me excited to read the next book in this series.  This was my first book by Rachel Van Dyken and I'm definitely kicking myself that I didn't pick up one of her books sooner!\nJake's thumb rubbed across her fingers delicately. Another involuntary shiver ran down her spine. \n\nIt's not real, Kacey. Just remember it's not real. He doesn't really like you in that way. Do it for Grandma!\n\nJake Titus propositioned Kacey to pretend to be his fiance. They were childhood friends, but after a falling out they hadn't spoken in a few years. Jake was feeling pressure from his family's company to change his playboy persona and his Grandma, who loved Kacey and had been sick, wanted to see her. So by bringing Kacey back home, he'd be back in his family and company's good graces and he would help Kacey out with her college expenses in return. It sounded like the perfect win win situation. Yet nothing could prepare Kacey for being back in the Titus' house, especially with Travis there. He was Jake's older brother who was horrific to Kacey as a child.\nHe'd be a fool to let her go. Again . - Jake\nI was definitely confused at first. Was I supposed to love Kacey with Jake or Travis?  But over time we got to see who deserved Kacey's heart. In the beginning, Kacey and Jake's interactions were adorable. They had a friendship that was definitely complicated and filled with some hurt. But it also felt strong and true, or at least it use to be that way. You see, we got to hear lots of stories referencing Kacey and Jake's past and I laughed so hard I cried. Their past was hysterical! But the more I saw who Jake was, I wasn't the biggest fan of him. He would come across as a self centered asshole. He could make the worst choices and it all seemed to center on instant gratification. And he never thought about how the ramifications would affect others. But Jake seemed like the type where if he really wanted something, he'd find a way to make it happen.\nTravis held up his wine. \"To conquering old fears?\" Something shifted between them. His eyes, though it was dark, seemed to he hiding something, as if he were talking about more than her stupid phobia. She leaned in, now completely relaxed from drowning half of her wine already, and whispered, \"To conquering old fears.\"\nNow Travis and Kacey? They made me laugh so hard too, but each moment had something else coursing through it. There was a tension between them that was always crackling and it left me with the hugest grin on my face. Travis and Kacey's moments together were \nso\n hot.  Even when they were throwing jabs at each other. They could also be ridiculously immature and it was so much fun. I loved their teasing and their weird obsession with food fights. It made my heart smile and I couldn't stop laughing!\nHe wondered if she could hear his heart hammering in his chest. \"Because of you, Kace. Everything I do, everything I've done in my life it's all because of you.\" - Travis\nTravis was definitely book boyfriend material! He looked out for Kacey and he thought about her happiness first. Yeah he would screw up from time to time, but ultimately he was her biggest protector and champion. So I kept my fingers crossed that that was who Kacey would end up with, because sometimes it didn't feel as though it'd pan out in that direction. So be careful with your hearts! Speaking of my heart.... ohhhhh I have to say I think everyone will love Grandma!! She was funny, smart, devious and I'm looking forward to seeing what she's up to in the next book!\n\nBoth brothers. One a friend, the other something so much more.\n\nSo I definitely recommend The Bet!  It's for everyone who adores NA stories that have tension running through them. And if you love drama that's fun, with sillier moments laced through it, then this is definitely your book! The next book is about the brother who wasn't meant for Kacey and I'm so excited to see what happens to him!PS So here's a weird confession. Usually I don't read books with the name Travis. It's my brothers name and yeah it just feels weird. But I call my brother Trav and I heard that wasn't used in this book, thank goodness!!For more of my reviews, please visit:"}, {"userName": "Myrna", "userReviewDate": "May 05, 2016", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/8789819-myrna", "userReview": "This is my first Rachel Van Dyken book and I'm pleased as punch.

Well, that was the case with Rachel Van Dyken's \"The Bet.\" I was expecting a serious, angst filled, heart breaking read that centred around a love triangle. Holy cow did I get it wrong but in a really good way. In fact, Kacey, Jake and Travis's story couldn't have come at a better time. I'd just read some pretty heavy books and this was just what the doctor ordered. \"The Bet\" was a romantic comedy that was cute, light hearted and very funny. This was the kind of book that you could kick your shoes off to, grab a glass of wine and lose yourself in for an afternoon. It was fab and just what I needed. \n\n\"Where have you been all my life?\"\"Home. I've been home, waiting for you.\" \n\nAlthough this was kind of a love triangle, it wasn't really (cryptic I know but it's difficult to explain without giving too much away). Once you get to know the characters, all will become clear. So if you're not a fan of those ugly three way push and pull relationships, don't fear because this is not one of those. There was no cheating and definitely no forbidden romance. Everything that happened between Jake, Kacey and Travis happened for a reason and as fate should play it, the right man got the girl in the end. Kacey's journey to finding her hero was brilliant. I don't think I've ever laughed so much reading a book. Everything that could go wrong for this trio, did. Every opportunity for getting a HEA was scuppered by someone or something. As truths from the past came to light I couldn't help but giggle. Oh what young boys do to try and get their girl... lol. \n\nHe knew for a fact Kacey loved princess stories. She would talk about how girls are supposed to be treated like princesses, and boys are supposed to be princes. But how was he supposed to be a prince when there were no dragons to slay? How could he prove himself when there were no monsters? Good thing he was the smartest kid in his class. He knew just what to do. All he had to do was cause the trouble and then save her from it. \n\nThe characters in \"The Bet\" were fab. OK so almost all of them. Travis was just so swoon worthy. He had his own ranch so in my head I'd already pitched him as a cowboy!!! He was a gentleman through and through. Kind, caring and considerate but definitely alpha which is always a plus in my book. Kacey was equally brilliant. She had a strength to her which I admired but there was also a vulnerability which was to be expected. After all, she had a history with the boys. Some of it good but some of it had definitely left it's mark on her and not in a good way. Coming back to her home town and seeing Jake and Travis wasn't all sunshine and rainbows. For the most part, it had reopened old wounds... wounds that had forced Kacey to up sticks and leave her home all those years ago. Which brings me on to Jake. Dear lord did that man test my patience. His arrogance and self centred attitude made me want to knock him down a peg or two. Egotistical is putting it mildly. I cannot wait to read his story. I have a feeling there's more to this man than meets the eye (I'm hoping anyway) and the woman that manages to capture his heart... boy oh boy will she have her work cut out!!!\n\n\u201cI\u2019ll get hurt either way, Travis. Just depends on which brother I decide to give the opportunity to.\"\n\nSo I've talked about the three main characters but I cannot write this review without talking about Grandma. OMG everyone should have a grandma like her. She was hilarious with her meddling ways but I'm so glad she was the way she was because without her, the path to true love may never have been found. I loved her conniving ways. She really added something special to this story line. So all in all, a really good, chilled out, didn't get my knickers in a twist read. If you're looking for something that's going to go easy on the old heart strings, that won't leave you needing anti depressant or anxiety meds, that will leave your sides hurting from not only the situations the characters get themselves into but also the very witty, almost child like banter between them, then I cannot recommend this enough. I rated \"The Bet\" \u2764\ufe0f\u2764\ufe0f\u2764\ufe0f\u2764\ufe0f\n\n\u201cBecause of you, Kace.

Invece mi ritrovo a leggere una sit-com di terz'ordine.Non mi piace criticare in maniera pesante un libro, che a molti magari sar\u00e0 piaciuto, ma il libro della Dyken \u00e9 ridicolo oltre ogni ragionevole dubbio!!!Trama, dialoghi, personaggi e stile dell'autrice, non riesco a salvare nulla.Andiamo per ordine la trama : piena zeppa di clich\u00e9 dato che l'autrice ci propina la solita solfa, ovvero ragazza bellissima e scema si innamora di quello sbagliato/stronzo/narcisista.Oltre al pessimo e ridicolo triangolo che diventa perlopi\u00f9 una comica!Tutto si trascina con una lentezza e ridicolaggine assurde : uno stile sciapo e frivolo che alterna improbabili pov, riuscendo solo a rendere la lettura confusa e noiosa.Dialoghi infantili, imbarazzanti, e privi di senso, che danno pi\u00f9 che altro l'idea di scheck da sit- com.

La nonna che definire un tanto sopra le righe, sarebbe un po' riduttivo... \u00e9 la vera chicca della storia. Passionale e spregiudicata, brillante e manipolatrice ma a fin di bene!Ok con questa lettura avr\u00f2 fritto buona parte dei miei neuroni, ma davvero non riuscivo a chiudere questo libro. Esilarante e demenziale, volevo sapere quale altra idiozia l'autrice avrebbe tirato fuori.Kaesy che ha paura del cartone animato Alice nel paese delle meraviglie, Trevis che chiude gli occhi davanti agli orsetti del cuore, rotolavo dalle risate leggendo ogni paragrafo.Sono stata ottimista riguardo al numero di neuroni fritti :)Vi consiglio di leggere questo libro che, senza dubbio, sapr\u00e0 regalarvi momenti di ilarit\u00e0 infinita.2 stelle goodreads"}], "description": "The #1 New York Times bestseller... \"I have a proposition for you.\" Kacey should have run the minute those words left Seattle millionaire Jake Titus's mouth.
