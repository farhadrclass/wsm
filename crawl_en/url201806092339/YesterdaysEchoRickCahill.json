The detective investigating the crime believes that Cahill was guilty of the murder, but did not have enough evidence to make the case. The cloud of suspicion has followed Cahill for the last eight years, even down to La Jolla, the beautiful seaside community that exists within the city of San Diego. Cahill is now the managing partner of an upscale restaurant there and is attempting to maintain a low profile while he builds his life anew.That's easier said than done, because Cahill is one of those guys who simply seems to draw trouble like a magnet. One night the wife of the mayor of San Diego gets obnoxiously drunk in the restaurant. Her husband is making a run for the California governorship, and Cahill attempts to get the woman out of the restaurant without creating a scandal, either for her or her husband. He puts her in a cab and sends her home. That same night, a beautiful TV reporter named Melody Malana shows up, perhaps in pursuit of a story about the governor's wife. Melody winds up in Cahill's bed that night, and he thinks this could be his chance to find true love again. But then a murder occurs and Cahill gets tangled up in an awful mess. It's like deja vu all over again, and Cahill finds himself a principal suspect.This is one of those novels in which a man is trapped in a bad situation by circumstances beyond his control and in which he can't trust anyone other than himself. The only way to salvation is for Cahill to unravel a very tangled web of deceit, but very clever and deadly forces are arrayed against him. It will take all his wits and a lot of good luck if he's to avoid winding up either dead or in jail this time around.This book moves along at a breakneck pace, and the character of Rick Cahill is gradually revealed as the story unfolds. He's an interesting guy and you feel for the situation in which he finds himself. That said, I had a bit of trouble buying into the story because Cahill continued to make decisions that I found questionable. Still, it's an entertaining novel--the first in the Rick Cahill series--and if you can suspend disbelief, it's quite a ride."}, {"userName": "Maureen DeLuca", "userReviewDate": "Jan 13, 2017", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/44509500-maureen-deluca", "userReview": "I'm giving this book a 3 star read and I am adding another 1 star for the potential of a very good series. The main character, Rick Cahill I really liked, but there was more than one time were I got totally frustrated by him. Being an x-cop there were many times where he was in such poor judgement of the situation, and then other times he was brilliant. I'm curious to see how his character develops in the next book in the series.While reading this book, a few times I just wanted it to move on-there were quite a bit moving parts throughout the story. Having said that - it really did leave a nice layout for a potential great series. Read the book with an open mind- getting to know Rick and his backstory. I am hoping for a really good series!"}, {"userName": "Judy Collins", "userReviewDate": "May 29, 2015", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/11063006-judy-collins", "userReview": "Matt Coyle delivers an intense new crime thriller series YESTERDAY\u2019S ECHO, (Rich Cahill #1), with a flawed main protagonist who seems to find trouble around every corner; however, his tenacity and drive, keep him fighting to the bitter end in search for redemption.If Rick Cahill is not enough trouble, it soon begins to intensify. Rick has been left with little choices, as former young hotshot cop in Santa Barbara. Someone murdered his wife and fingers were pointed at him. Charges were dropped, but he lost his job and out from jail, has began working at a bar/restaurant, he hopes to own one day (Muldoon\u2019s Steak House). Now he finds himself tangled up with a reporter and a dark past and dangers are lurking from everywhere. Of course, it turns into a high profile case. His dad was also a former cop and a corrupt one. Not a stellar view from the La Jolla PD. Presently, eight years later, he is still haunted by his wife Coleen\u2019s death, as the media was all over it, and now he meets manipulative Melody Malana, a reporter who knew him from his earlier days. He finds himself in her bed and soon thereafter in the middle of another murder investigation. He always finds himself in a lose-lose situation; however, is determined to dig his way out. There is more than one person after her. Melody is arrested for murder  and asks for Rick\u2019s help. His first indication is to stay clear; however, Rick does not understand the word \"NO\". Anything involving danger and obstacles, he is in the center with guns blazing. In the midst of doing so\u00b8 he now becomes a suspect and target. The bad guys come after him and the only two things he has left, his bar job, and his beloved dog, Midnight are now threatened. Someone wants their past to stay buried and Rick is trying to uncover, putting himself in even more danger.From sex, crimes, a dark past,  politics, corruption, and videos, Rick risks his own life and reputation for a woman who is hiding from a past for a roller coaster ride and a whodunit crime mystery. Matt Coyle is an author to follow, with a superb kick-ass series! After receiving an ARC of Night Tremors, I immediately purchased the audio of Yesterday's Echo (Rick Cahill #1), narrated by Nick Podehl, delivering an intense and suspenseful performance, prior to reading the second.  NIGHT TREMORS  (6/2/15) Matt Coyle, returns with his engrossing and complex second installment of crime thriller (Rick Cahill #2), a fierce comeback, with grit, tenacity, suspense, and intensity --with a flawed hero with his own demons; one you will you will root for, every step of the way. Recommend reading both in order. An unstoppable main character, leaving you anxiously awaiting the next in this exciting noir crime series. (love the California setting)! Fans of classic hard-boiled PI detective novels will enjoy this one. As related to the hard-boiled genre, the main protagonist goes from victim, suspect, perpetrator, and always in self-destructive mode. As typical of Noir fiction, Rick seems to always be in the middle of something illegal, dirty cops, or political corruption, on a daily basis--as you will find true to form, in the next book."}, {"userName": "Lindley", "userReviewDate": "Apr 17, 2013", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/7811034-lindley", "userReview": "The mystery portion of this story was well done--I enjoyed the twists and turns on the way to solving the story's central question. I also enjoyed the fast-paced nature of the plotting. However, I found other portions of the story frustrating. For a former cop, Rick proved himself to be a pretty poor judge of character in a number of key scenes, yet would make brilliant deductions just a few scenes later. I also couldn't buy his Superman complex when it came to Melody, a woman he'd just met. Throughout the entire novel, the death of Rick's wife is teased, only to be revealed quickly at the very end of the story. From the way Rick reminisced about his wife's death through the whole novel, I thought his revelation would end up being more central to the story than it ultimately was, and I ended up a little letdown when he finally explained the mystery behind her death."}, {"userName": "Suze", "userReviewDate": "Aug 24, 2015", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/26071136-suze", "userReview": "YESTERDAY'S ECHORick Cahill is a restaurant manager leading a very quiet life, and constantly kicking himself for his past mistakes.

Rick was accused of the crime but never convicted. Unable to fight the media maelstrom, he retreats to La Jolla, CA, to help run a restaurant with his best (and only) friend. It isn\u2019t much of an existence but Rick is slowly regaining control of his life. Fate arrives in the figure of Melody, a gorgeous Filipina who embroils Rick in a lethal entanglement. Before too long, the protagonist finds himself back in the crosshairs of the media and the police, who remember all too well the cop that got away with murder. VERDICT: Coyle does a superb job of drawing the reader in and keeps a steady pace of action along with solid character development. This celebration of the crime noir novels of old with a modern sensibility in Rick Cahill as hero will strongly appeal to fans of classic hard-boiled PI novels."}, {"userName": "Carol", "userReviewDate": "Sep 18, 2017", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/8104446-carol", "userReview": "Yesterday's Echo by Matt CoyleRick Cahill series Book #14.5\u2605'sThis is an author that bears watching.

And what better place than America's Finest City, San Diego. The sequence of events built momentum from the beginning and carried through to the end. There was no putting the book down.Eight years ago, Rick Cahill's wife had been brutally raped and murdered. He was named prime suspect in her murder. There wasn't enough evidence to hold him so he was set free. For what it was worth, he was innocent. His employer, The San Bernardino Police Department saw things differently. They wanted no part of him. He had been driven out from the force. Apparently, he really wasn't free after all. Regardless the evidence, everyone still held him responsible for his wife's murder. The media had a big hand in that. The way things were going, it was time to move on. To the rescue came an ole' buddy who offered him a job in his restaurant in La Jolla. He jumped at the opportunity to get away. He wasted no time in getting down there. It was time to start a new life.Eight years later, he's now the manager of the restaurant. Hard work's paid off. He immersed himself in his job with the hope it would help bury his troubled past. Good luck with that. Again, thanks to the media, his undeserved reputation linking him to an unsolved murder always seemed to follow him wherever he went. There was no escaping. The best he could come up with was to keep as low a profile as possible. As he'd come to find out, that's easier said than done.One evening, at his restaurant he met Melody, a TV reporter who also happened to be a real hottie. The night's off to a good start, so he hoped. Melody didn't happen in there by accident. Well aware of his background, she sought his help for a murder of which she was being accused. Rick agreed to come to her aid. Hopefully, in more ways than one. It had been a long time.As Rick digs in and begins to untangle the evidence, he finds himself a hunted man by the La Jolla PD. The charge - murder. What the hell brought this on! He's now on the run not only from the police but also from the people that he's found who need to keep their pasts hidden. And they're determined to stop him at any cost. Even if it means his own death."}, {"userName": "Jodi", "userReviewDate": "Oct 05, 2014", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/1012601-jodi", "userReview": "This book is nominated for both the Anthony and Macavity Awards for best first mystery novel. I liked the writing style, and there is an interesting and plausible plot. I had trouble with the lead character, Rick Cahill. Cahill is a former Santa Barbara Police Officer who was arrested for the murder of his wife. The charges were dismissed, but Cahill never escaped the cloud of the arrest. He moved back to LaJolla where he grew up and started working for an old friend Turk Muldoon who now owns his father's restaurant and bar. Turk was one of the only people to accept Cahill after the murder of his wife, and helped Cahill back on his feet. One evening at the restaurant 3 people come in that starts Cahill's world spinning out of control, and he soon finds himself the suspect of another homicide. In my opinion, Cahill does some really stupid things that are inconsistent with being a former cop, a person previously accused of the murder of his wife and a person trying to protect himself from another false arrest and accusation. He is kind of a jerk to the few friends he has left. These things, especially the stupid stuff, drove me crazy. I am not so sure they were necessary to the story or plot either.

I don't like police procedurals because the notion of the cop as hero has always been a stretch for me and Yesterday's Echo is lousy with power-tripping cops, corrupt cops, asshole cops (I know I'm getting redundant here) which made the peril feel legit. Coyle's protagonist is an ex-cop who was kicked off the force in disgrace and drags the baggage of his many sins, and the sins of his father, everywhere he goes. His relationships with the women in the novel is a bit more problematic: we're not quite in the virgin/whore territory but close enough to knock it down half a star. Nonstop action, well-written scenes, and a bit of wit make Yesterday's Echo a super compelling California noir."}, {"userName": "janjones", "userReviewDate": "May 09, 2016", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/46509521-janjones", "userReview": "Loved it.

He's a guy that's had his share of bad luck but he's trying to rebuild his life. Unfortunately for Rick, he meets up with a woman who resurrects the painful issues from his past, complicates his present day, and puts his future at risk. There is good character development throughout the book including the political spouse with her own complicated past, the life long friend whose loyalty is called into question, the mysterious woman you're not sure you (or Rick!) should believe and the slick, sophisticated goon who wreaks havoc whenever he appears. There is also wonderful descriptive writing that makes it easy to picture the story in your mind. Most importantly to me, the author wrapped up the suspenseful journey in a way that felt satisfying.
