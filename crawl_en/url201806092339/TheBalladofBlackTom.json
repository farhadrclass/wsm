His prose is a bit too antiquated for my tastes. So when I found out he hated all skin tones darker than Elmer's-glue, it didn't bother me because I already didn't like the guy. Am I dumb enough to think all his fans must be racist because he was? No. I know plenty of radically non-racist individuals who love his stuff. These folks can look past the artist to appreciate the mythos he created. Good on them. The problem for me is, I'm not even a fan of his mythos. Squid-faced gods and monsters so ugly the author can't be bothered to describe them never have done much for me. It's all too easy to say, \"Oh, snap! That thing is so scurry my mind can't even wrap around it, yo!\" I wish all of us could get away with that; describing everything as too scary to describe. It would make being a horror author much easier. So why did I read this? Well, Gregor Xane read it and shared with me the epigraph, which reads, \"For H.P. Lovecraft, with all my conflicted feelings.\" You see, Victor LaValle is a mixed dude who grew up reading Lovecraft. When LaValle was in his teens, he found out about Lovecraft's extreme racism, but decided to play with the old Aryan's mythos anyway. I respect that. The idea of the offendee reimagining an offender's work piqued my interest. Kinda like what would happen if the crew over at Kidz Bop paid tribute to Michael Jackson. (Too soon?) Anyfuck, that's why I read it. And I'm glad I did, because this motherfucker was damn good. I also find it hilarious on several levels that LaValle does Lovecraft better than Lovecraft did Lovecraft. The Ballad of Black Tom is first told from the POV of Tommy Tester, a dude who becomes the titular Black Tom. At exactly the halfway point, the POV switches to a detective named Malone. While Tom's section is more of an introduction, Malone's section brings home the creepy, gory bacon. The description of Ma Att's shadow/tail/ whatever-the-fuck was so subtle and well done, it actually raised gooseflesh on my forearms. I honestly cannot remember the last time a simple grouping of words affected me physically. I am in awe. LaValle nailed that scene. I can say, truthfully, it's in my top ten scenes ever written. The descriptions of the monster under the water and the low note played throughout the piece were equally well written. As for the story itself? It's definitely my cuppa tea. A slow burn that goes into a bit of what-the-fuckery before the ending leaves our protagonist forever changed. I dug the fuck out of this little book and I want more.In summation: The Ballad of Black Tom is now my forerunner for Novella of the Year 2016. I'll be looking for more LaValle, as this one has officially made me a fan.Final Judgment: Eye opening.(Gregor Xane shared this link with me after I read the book.

When he meets Robert Suydam, things will never be the same...I've always been a bigger fan of things inspired by H.P. Lovecraft than the man's actual work. It's certainly been a good few months for H.P. Lovecraft-inspired fiction for me. First, there was Carter & Lovecraft, then Lovecraft Country, and now this novella, the Ballad of Black Tom.Victor LaValle has taken The Horror at Red Hook, called Lovecraft's most racist book by some, and turned it inside out.Tommy Tester delivers a magical tome to an old woman, runs afoul of two detectives, and meets up with an old man bent on waking The Sleeping King from his dead and dreaming slumber. Needless to say, a lot happens in this slim book.There was a viewpoint shift about halfway through. While I didn't think Malone was as interesting as Black Tom, the story couldn't have been told without him. LaValle does a fantastic job of capturing the Lovecraftian flavor of The Horror at Red Hook and makes it his own. I loved the ending of this book.

(and by all accounts, cormac mccarthy is a professional, decent, and humble gentleman, so you\u2019re welcome, tennessee) this book is lavalle\u2019s reworking of lovecraft\u2019s The Horror at Red Hook, which is apparently considered to be lovecraft\u2019s \u201cmost racist ever,\u201d despite the existence of his poem On the Creation of Niggers, which goes a little something like this:When, long ago, the gods created EarthIn Jove's fair image Man was shaped at birth.The beasts for lesser parts were next designed;Yet were they too remote from humankind.To fill the gap, and join the rest to Man,Th'Olympian host conceiv'd a clever plan.A beast they wrought, in semi-human figure,Filled it with vice, and called the thing a Nigger.that is stunningly toxic, but at least it is very short. if The Horror at Red Hook is somehow even more racist and also longer and probably also filled with his brand of \u201cdude, this horror i\u2019m writing about is so horrifying, i can\u2019t even tell you about it. seriously. it would blow your mind too much. just trust me -it is super scary wwwwOOOoooo\u2026,\u201d well, i\u2019m happy to avoid it. all of this to say that i have no clue how this novella functions as a response to or a reworking of the original. all i know is that i enjoyed lavalle\u2019s writing, particularly the way he scrapped that turgid lovecraftian vocabulary, and chose to employ a modified version of lovecraft\u2019s inexpressible horror, where the horror is at least partially expressed; described enough so it retains a sense of mystery without leaving the reader with nothing. bonus points for name-dropping the fine little rhody towns of pascoag and chepachet, which were mentioned in the source material, so no biggie there (yeah, i researched this read the wikipedia page, what?), but for ALSO mentioning woonsocket, the location of the hospital in which i first drew breath. i don\u2019t know what is happening there, but it seems about right.to conclude: h.p. lovecraft - an unpleasant man with a gigantic head buried in the cemetery where i used to smoke pot and take gothy pictures.victor lavalle - a man from queens (represent!) who seems quite affable and counters lovecraft's bullshit with this book and a photograph i am calling \"the horror at red tongue...\""}, {"userName": "Char", "userReviewDate": "Dec 21, 2015", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/6581119-char", "userReview": "4.5 stars!\u201cNobody ever thinks of himself as a villain, does he?

Shall I pull it free?\"\n\nWhile I'm generally familiar with HP Lovecraft and his work, including his Cthulhu mythos, I haven't read that much from him. From what I gather though, he was a hardcore racist, and one must look past some of the uncomfortable material in his work to get to the good stuff and appreciate him. It seems like this has been the case with author Victor LaValle, who begrudgingly considers himself a fan. But he decided to use this conflicted appreciation of the horror master as inspiration for his latest project. In this novella, he has taken what many consider to be one of Lovecraft's most xenophobic work, \"The Horror at Red Hook,\" and remixed it, cleverly transforming it into a cosmic horror tale that is also a commentary on racial and immigrant prejudice, and a big clapback at Lovecraft's bigotry in his own work. \n\nThe smell of age, meaning undifferentiated time, had settled throughout the home, a musty odor, as if the winds of the present never blew through here.\n\n I don't want to say much about the plot other than it's about a young black hustler in Harlem that does whatever it takes to survive as a black man in 1920's New York, the strange world he encounters in the underbelly of the city, and how these things affect and provide an outlet for his frustration and anger at the oppression that he must endure everyday. There's some great creepy imagery in this that LaValle handles masterfully and with a steady pace that sucks you in, making this short book hard to put down.\n\nA cataclysm was happening on Parker Place, and belowground the air here smelled of sewage and smoke and the threat of divination."}, {"userName": "Richard Derus", "userReviewDate": "Aug 10, 2017", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/3920693-richard-derus", "userReview": "[that Charles Thomas turned into Black Tom offstage and in a convenient hurry, which is also (hide spoiler)]"}, {"userName": "Elena May", "userReviewDate": "Jun 29, 2017", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/57120721-elena-may", "userReview": "Nobody ever thinks of himself as a villain, does he?\n\nThe Ballad of Black Tom is a retelling of H. P. Lovecraft\u2019s story \u201cThe Horror at Red Hook.\u201d Full disclaimer: I\u2019m not familiar with Lovecraft\u2019s works. I\u2019ve read quite a bit about him but never read his actual writing. Fans will probably perceive this differently, but from my newbie point of view, this was \nan atmospheric, pleasantly weird page-turner\n that easily stood on its own.I have to admit I liked the historical fiction elements much more than the fantasy parts. We see this richly described and absolutely beautiful version of 1920s Harlem through Thomas Tester\u2019s eyes:\n\nWalking through Harlem first thing in the morning was like being a single drop of blood inside an enormous body that was waking up. Brick and mortar, elevated train tracks, and miles of underground pipe, this city lived; day and night it thrived. \n\nBefore Thomas Tester goes through a creepy transformation, \nhe can see beauty in everything despite the poverty and oppression\n. Seeing Harlem through his eyes, I also found it charming. And that\u2019s unusual \u2013 in the recent years, I\u2019ve lost my ability to find charm in busy, crowded cities. When I first visited NYC, I thought it was amazing and loved how alive it was. But then, I spent some time in very overcrowded places, such as Hong Kong and Singapore, and then over a year in London, and now I\u2019d choose a quiet place where you can hear the birds singing over a crowded metropolis on any day. And yet, I read this and I loved 1920s Harlem.And then we get Cthulhu...Yeah... I admit I never got the appeal.The fantasy elements aren\u2019t as impressive as the historical. There isn\u2019t much world-building as the book is essentially a Lovecraft fanfic, so the mythos is already there. I\u2019m not the best judge on how well that was done, but still some things didn\u2019t make sense. A mysterious old lady, who is hinted to be a powerful non-human entity, goes through a lot of trouble to get The Supreme Alphabet, and then never seems to use it. The Alphabet has been in her possession for a week when she is easily defeated and doesn\u2019t seem to put in any struggle. Also, our protagonist, Thomas Tester / Black Tom, becomes powerful off-screen. I would have preferred to see how he gets there.The book\u2019s greatest strength seems to be that it takes the incredibly racist source material and creates a critical retelling. Indeed, in some ways The Ballad of Black Tom tackles the topics of racism, prejudice, and police brutality in the US really well. It may all seem a bit cartoonish and heavy-handed at first, but not in the way that makes readers pat themselves on the back and say, \u201cWell done! It was sooo bad back then, but we don\u2019t have these problems anymore!\u201d On the contrary \u2013 while we see that it was indeed horrible back then, the parallels to what is happening nowadays are clear and uncomfortable. The real horror is that almost a hundred year later, things haven\u2019t changed all that much.But this is also what bothers me the most about this book. It tries to be a reaction to Lovecraft\u2019s racism, but at the same time it creates an exoticised, mystical, violent, and dehumanized image of immigrants. Robert Suydam , the rich white man who plans to summon Cthulhu, invites a group of fifty recent immigrants he plans to use as allies:\n\nTester knew how to recognize a room full of roughnecks. This bunch qualified. Suydam had haunted waterfronts and back alleys to find this crew of cutthroats. The kind of place Tommy imagined the Victoria Society would be was what these criminals called home sweet home. \n\nWe never hear them speak. We never learn anything about their lives or even learn their names. All we see is their reaction to Robert Suydam\u2019s plan to destroy the world as we know it and rise from the ashes:\n\nThey shouted back. They clapped each other on the shoulders. Founding fathers of a new nation, or even better, a world now theirs to administer and control. \n\nALL OF THEM??? Not a single one questions the plan? Not a single one disagrees? They are an indistinguishable, monolithic block, and the only one who stands out is Thomas Tester \u2013 the one born and raised in the US.While immigrants are mentioned all over the book, not a single one ever speaks. The only kind of exceptions are when a woman says something in a language the detective doesn\u2019t understand (so we are practically told she speaks, but not what she says) and when Thomas Tester\u2019s friend remembers two brothers from Fiji, long dead, who mentioned Cthulhu. Hmmmm. Fiji has a rich and original mythology, and all of this is erased and replaced by Lovecraft\u2019s creations. Not cool.I also have to mention that there are no female characters in this book (and, no, I\u2019m not going to call the non-human entity that barely speaks or the nameless witness \u201ccharacters.\u201d) Since the majority of main characters could have been gender-swapped easily, this skewed all-male world in an urban setting appears to be the author\u2019s choice, for whatever reason.Overall, while not perfect, \nthe novella is fun, fast-paced and thought-provoking\n. Readers, unfamiliar with Lovecraft, can still understand and appreciate it. Perhaps Lovecraft fans will enjoy it even more.I read this book as a part of my goal to read all Hugo finalists."}, {"userName": "Jessica Woodbury", "userReviewDate": "Jan 14, 2016", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/4271946-jessica-woodbury", "userReview": "These days there's much discussion about what to do with the difficult legacy of H. P. Lovecraft. What do you do with one of the founders of modern horror who was not only racist but includes those views in his writing? If you're a person who reads widely or likes to deep dive, at some point you may find yourself confronting the question of whether you should read Lovecraft and what it means.I have good news for you. You don't need to read Lovecraft anymore. Instead, you can read THE BALLAD OF BLACK TOM. LaValle has done something incredible. He's written a Lovecraft novel with themes of racial injustice at its center, turned Lovecraft's legacy on its head. And his real feat is that by giving his book a strong emotional center, he's surpassed Lovecraft. I read a bit of Lovecraft, I appreciated the weird and the dread and the undercurrent of malevolence in his books, but I never felt like I could burrow myself into one and live in it. There's a coldness to Lovecraft. I don't know if LaValle wanted that same coldness. He certainly holds the reader at arm's length. But there is a big fat beating heart in this book no matter how careful and calculated it is. This is a book that is more about feelings than it is about Cthulu. It is more about shame and hatred and anger and what those feelings do to you than it is about the weird and supernatural. This is my third LaValle book and I am consistently excited by his work. He does things no one else does. I don't know where his books will take me. And that's one of the highest compliments I can give."}, {"userName": "Lyn", "userReviewDate": "Jul 29, 2017", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/5253785-lyn", "userReview": "Amongst the unnamable and innumerable legion of books and stories who have been inspired by HP Lovecraft, a thoughtful reader can make divisions into \u201cfan lit\u201d in the lower shelves, akin to the discount whiskies and blended Scotches, to the middle shelves of Kentucky bourbons and Tennessee whiskies (Jack and George) with the motivated stand-alone stories paying subtle tribute, to the top shelf single malt Scotch and single barrels of truly amazing works who have used Lovecraft as a starting off point for their embarkation into the eldritch and arcane.We can find Victor LaValle\u2019s 2016 novella The Ballad of Black Tom on the top shelf next to the Crown Royal black.Paying tribute to Lovecraft, this is also a remarkable work in that LaValle uses settings and themes reminiscent of Lovecraft while also telling a gritty, horrific story on it\u2019s own. I thought of films like the 1987 Alan Parker film Angel Heart, Francis Ford Coppola's 1984 film The Cotton Club and Eddie Murphy\u2019s 1989 film Harlem Nights as LaValle has crafted a tale that brings to life the colorful and vibrant life of Harlem in the 1920s. (Even though Angel Heart was actually set later).Most compelling, though, is that LaValle has created a dramatic response to Lovecraft\u2019s most racist story, The Horror at Red Hook. Lovecraft\u2019s 1927 story describes a xenophobic anxiety about the multi-cultural mix of ethnicities in this section of New York. Whereas Lovecraft had used his own time\u2019s intolerance of immigrants to produce a story of racist fear and loathing, LaValle turns the angst and temerity of the downtrodden against the white establishment, and produces a Cthulhu story set apart by its own audacity. This is a Lovecraftian story with a modern day twist.Recommended for fans of the New Cthulhu as well as horror fans in general, a very good read."}, {"userName": "Lindsay", "userReviewDate": "Feb 18, 2016", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/10326608-lindsay", "userReview": "The story of a black man in 1920s New York is pretty horrible even without fantastic elements.

The story itself has a rhythm all its own, but also builds the kind of \"creeping dread\" plot structure that Lovecraft was famous for. Thematically, The Ballad of Black Tom has more in common with Richard Wright's \"Native Son\" than anything the famously racist Lovecraft ever wrote, as the protagonist Tommy Tester is eventually browbeaten into becoming the monster that white America assumes him to be anyway. He finds he has more purpose as a servant of ancient evil deities than he does living with the boot heel of racism pressing on his neck everyday.I liked this story a lot, particularly the expertly written sequences of gothic horror.

(4 stars) The historical setting was very well done (4 stars) as was the incorporation of real-life social and political issues (4 stars). The characters had a lot of potential (3 stars) but it wasn't developed enough, partly due to the short length of the book (2 stars), and partly due to the prose being very telling-rather-than-showing (2 stars). I found Detective Malone especially opaque, although kudos to LaValle for not making him a stereotypical bluff blue collar cop drawn by chance into supernatural danger (3 stars). The plot seemed solid but again, the book felt too short. It seemed as if the author had a great idea, wrote a solid draft, and then decided to publish while the Lovecraft Revamp market was still hot rather than polishing it. Overall 3.5 stars, rounding down because I feel convinced LaValle could do better.I finished this filled with the desire to rain down (or up, I supposed) chtonic destruction on an unjust world, and also to eat alcapurrias."}, {"userName": "Paul O'Neill", "userReviewDate": "Jan 09, 2017", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/17331573-paul-o-neill", "userReview": "This was all a bit scrambled.

Lovecraft was a giant racist and all-around shitty human being, but it\u2019s utterly impossible to deny the man\u2019s tremendous influence on the modern horror genre, his ability to craft some damn fine stories, and the legacy his Cthulhu mythos has borne on many a reader and writer. There\u2019s a degree of freshness then, and certainly a bit of satisfaction, in Victor LaValle reinterpreting Lovecraft\u2019s short story The Horror at Red Hook to produce The Ballad of Black Tom.Tom has been tasked with retrieving a book for the reclusive Ma Att, a job that eventually brings him into the orbit of two detectives and Robert Suydam, another reclusive sort who lives in a mansion in Flatbush. Inside this mansion is a peculiar library, and Tom becomes privy to a world he scarcely imagined, one that is quite a far cry from his Harlem roots. And that is all I\u2019m going to say about the plot; if you want to know more, read the synopsis.Set in 1920, LaValle is able to craft a serious and literary bit of cosmic/supernatural horror that brilliantly reflects on issues of race and class warfare. It\u2019s no secret that blacks and immigrants had it rough in 1920, and sadly we haven\u2019t progressed much further as an American society. Tom lives in a world marked by boundaries, where crossing over into a white community could be a death sentence at worst, or which could earn him a beating by the police if he\u2019s merely unlucky. The Ballad of Black Tom is an uncomfortable reflection of present-day America juxtaposed against an earlier period piece. Unarmed black men are killed by police, and the police themselves, modernized by Roosevelt, are practically an urban army ready to wage war against the minority population. Now, where have we heard about this before?LaValle\u2019s novella is a beautiful work in its own right, and as a Lovecraftian-fueled horror story it\u2019s downright gorgeous. There\u2019s plenty of creepy crawly moments and eeriness to satisfy fright fans and get those dark imaginings churning, and it\u2019s a solid and welcome addition to the legend of Cthulhu. Tor Books has really been knocking it out of the park with their series of novellas, and of the few that I\u2019ve read so far this title stands out as a particular highlight. Kudos to them, and most certainly to LaValle in particular for this fantastic read. Highly recommended."}, {"userName": "Max", "userReviewDate": "Mar 12, 2017", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/4212994-max", "userReview": "*Long low whistle*A really great, careful, creeping story\u2014unpacking the deep bonds between Lovecraft and American racial violence.

But the book stands alone very well.

Besides his personal beliefs that are repugnant, I find most of his stories hard to get into. I did read him though due to his being the creator of Chulthu. Most modern horror writers pay homage to him in their works so it's nice to get a good base of what they are drawing from.LaValle's \"The Ballad of Black Tom\" takes one of Lovecraft's short stories \"The Horror at Red Hook\" and twists it. I want to high five LaValle for having the main character to be a 20 year old African American man too (especially considering Lovecraft's racism) who in the end die to what actions have taken against him would be the bringer of the end of humanity as we know it.Charles Thomas Tester (Tommy) does what he can to take care of himself and his father. Since his mother has died, Charles father has aged practically overnight and barely seems part of the world. Living in Harlem during the Jazz Age has different meaning to African Americans. LaValle smartly gives readers quick looks into the small and big slights made against Tommy and others who are not white. When Tommy takes some work to deliver a book to a very odd woman, there begins an action that will leave repercussions for Charles.I do love that LaValle in the second part of the story focused the POV on Detective Thomas Malone (a character that appears in Lovecraft's story too). I loathe Malone. He wants an understanding of the occult and things he can see on the periphery of the world. But is indifferent to the immigrants, African Americans and other races he walks among in Red Hook. He and a private investigator end up entwined with Tommy due to actions they take and I'm probably a terrible person for enjoying what ends up becoming of that character and Malone.We also get another character from the Lovecraft story (Robert Suydam) who wants to free the African Americans other immigrants from the world they live in. I also took delight into what becomes of him too.The writing was lyrical to me. I could picture everything while reading. LaValle managed to transport me back to an earlier and uglier time in our country's history. When Tommy turns away from what he knows after a terrible blow I got it. The book is gruesome in parts so if you have a weak stomach you may want to skip it.\" Walking through Harlem first thing in the morning was like being a single drop of blood inside an enormous body that was waking up. Brick and mortar, elevated train tracks, and miles of underground pipe, this city lived; day and night it thrived.\"\"He decided to play a role that always worked on whites. The Clueless Negro.\"\"Tell me my father's dead and I'm going to take a I swing at you, Mr. Howard said. But these people really don't have the same connections I to each other as we do. That's been scientifically proven. They're like ants or bees. Mr. Howard waved one hand at the building beside them. That's why they can live like this.\"\"I'll take Chulthu over you devils any day.\"The ending was great and LaValle leaves you with a sense of a ticking clock on humanity and Tommy's own soul."}, {"userName": "Nancy Oakes", "userReviewDate": "Feb 18, 2016", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/900340-nancy-oakes", "userReview": "The Ballad of Black Tom is a book that takes H.P. Lovecraft's story \"The Horror at Red Hook\" and stands it on its head. LaValle says in an interview that he started reading Lovecraft around age 11, and found himself \"hooked.\" He says that while he liked Lovecraft's monsters, he \"loved the ideas even more, the scale of his imagination. Cosmic as fuck.\" This all changed when he turned sixteen, when, as he notes,\"I lost youthful innocence, I guess. Or I began to see things I'd once missed. Or ignored. Things that should've been obvious, but hasn't been.\"After going through a short list of what \"should've been obvious,\" he mentions that perhaps one of these is that he started to realize that his \"beloved Howard Phillips Lovecraft was one hell of a racist.\" Not only that, but he also mentions that his writing was pretty bad. Still, he continues to have a certain admiration for HP Lovecraft, and he wondered what would happen if he \"reimagined\" \"Horror at Red Hook,\" one of the most xenophobic, racist tales in HPL's repertoire, and brought the story forth from the points of view of the people \"playing the background.\" It's a ballsy move, in my opinion, and it works. I won't go much into the plot here, but a little appetite whetting might be in order. Tommy Tester, who lives in Harlem in a small apartment with his father, is a musician. He is playing on the streets one day when he's noticed by Robert Suydam, a wealthy white man who wants him to play for him at his home. The man offers Tommy a lot of money for a gig, and Tommy takes him up on it since the money would keep him and his father in groceries for a long while. It isn't long, though, until Tommy realizes that his new employer is no ordinary guy -- that he is fixated on a bizarre being he calls The Sleeping King. After the first night, Tommy is terrified and decides not to return. However, when the cops do something horrific that completely changes his life, Tommy realizes that \"a fear of cosmic indifference suddenly seemed comical, or downright naive,\" and goes back to Red Hook and Suydam. After all, he says, after what's happened to him, \"Indifference would be such a relief.\"The real crux of this book for me is reflected in something that Tommy says to Malone (remember him? The detective who survived \"the horror at Redhook\" in the original). The two are having a discussion about Suydam, and Malone asks him why he got involved with him. Tommy's answer is just genius and speaks volumes:\"I bear a hell within me...and finding myself unsympathized with, wished to tear up the trees, spread havoc and destruction around me, and then to have sat down and enjoyed the ruin.\" Now that's a story. And it's one that LaValle does very well."}, {"userName": "Steve", "userReviewDate": "Feb 25, 2016", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/2314568-steve", "userReview": "H.P. Lovecraft published The Horror at Red Hook in 1925. In it, a New York City detective by the name of Malone investigates strange goings-on in an immigrant populated section the city called Red Hook. As usual, the story takes place in Lovecraft\u2019s universe of cosmic horror, always subject to the return of the Elder Gods. Victor LaValle is writing a tribute of sorts to Lovecraft with The Ballad of Black Tom, which is basically a retelling of Red Hook.LaValle\u2019s description of 1920s New York is engrossing and visceral: you\u2019re walking the streets with main character Tommy Tester, riding the train, hustling for money with his guitar and trying to make ends meet, all while he tries to stay invisible in the eyes of the police. The other part of the story, of course, is the world of supernatural evil. LaValle makes this world feel just as real as the streets of Harlem.While LaValle takes some liberties with Lovecraft\u2019s story (guns versus clubs, erroneous conclusions about political leaders), the strongest feature is how he brings together the horrors of the real world: racism, police brutality, murder, injustice; with the supernatural horrors and evil powers at work beneath the surface of that real world. Obviously, Lovecraft was a deeply ingrained racist. His views today would be considered repugnant. LaValle took that and created a story that deals with the human capacity for evil, the effects of repression and injustice, and the evil and despair that can exist just beneath the thin veneer of so-called civilized society.This novella also has its terrifying moments; it is, after all, a Lovecraftian horror story. Even though it is relatively short, there is enough eeriness and darkness to satisfy Lovecraft\u2019s legions of fans. The end was unpredictable, and quite scary."}], "description": "People move to New York looking for magic and nothing will convince them it isn't there.Charles Thomas Tester hustles to put food on the table, keep the roof over his father's head, from Harlem to Flushing Meadows to Red Hook.
