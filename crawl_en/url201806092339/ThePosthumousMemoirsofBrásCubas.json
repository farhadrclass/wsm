(of course, there'd be a Machado backlash in which he'd be accused of gimmickry and unoriginality and being overly clever and blahblah) i don't laugh from books. i don't like funny books. machado forces me to take back both those statements. salman rushdie: 'the kind of humor that makes skulls smile.' check this exfuckingtraordinary excerpt, a veritable fuckfest of humor and tragedy:\"'Tis good to be sad and say nothing'\u2026 I remember that I was sitting under a tamarind tree, with the poet's book open in my hands and my spirit as crestfallen as a sick chicken. I pressed my silent grief to my breast and experienced a curious feeling, something that might be called the voluptuousness of misery. Voluptuousness of misery. Memorize the phrase, reader; store it away, take it out and study it from time to time, and, if you do not succeed in understanding it, you may conclude that you have missed one of the most subtle emotions of which man is capable.'\"ahhhh! headbashingly great stuff!3) susan sontag. karen brissette. two tough chicks, one dead & one alive, who push the shit outta machado. woody allen is a machado fan. as is carlos fuentes, salman rushdie, javier marias, and harold bloom. and sontag's introduction is, as always, a must read. she makes the interesting point that latin america produced such far-seeing and interesting literature not merely because the dictatorships tyrannies and repressive regimes produced a literature of 'pressure', but because the latin americans were those who were most enamored by laurence sterne... damn. i've really gotta read tristam shandy.enough said. you know what to do."}, {"userName": "Mike Puma", "userReviewDate": "Mar 27, 2011", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/4193758-mike-puma", "userReview": "\u201cDo not mourn the dead. They know what they are doing.\u201d \u2015 Clarice Lispector, The Hour of the StarWith those lines, Lispector might have introduced this novel by her countryman. Told from the other side of the grave, we learn of the narrator\u2019s small successes and small failures, ultimately balanced in the totality of things. Braz Cubas, the narrator, provides his autobiography, and his philosophy, with a gentle humor in a novel which anticipates the best of meta-fiction, breaking with a Romantic literary tradition in South America and leaping into a Realism that feels contemporary.\u201dCome, my great lecher, the voluptuousness of extinction awaits you.\u201dBraz Cubas describes his romances and political aspirations with a detachment:The sharp and judicial eye of public opinion loses its power as soon as we enter the territory of death. I do not deny that it sometimes glances this way and examines and judges us, but we dead folk are not concerned about its judgment. You who still live, believe me, there is nothing in the world so monstrously vast as our indifference He constantly cajoles and engages the reader: \u2019Tis good to be sad and say nothing.\u2019 When I read these words of Shakespeare, I felt within me an echo, a delicious echo. I remember sitting under a tamarind tree, with the poet\u2019s book open in my hands and my spirit as crestfallen as a sick chicken. I pressed my silent grief to my breast and experienced a curious feeling, something that might be called the voluptuousness of misery. Voluptuousness of misery. Memorize this phrase, reader; store it away, take it out and study it from time to time, and, if you do not succeed in understanding it, you may conclude you have missed one of the most subtle emotions of which man is capable. He likens life to the constant revision of a book:Let Pascal say man is a thinking reed. He is wrong; man is a thinking erratum. Each period in life is a new edition that corrects the preceding one and that in turn will be corrected by the next, until publication of the definitive edition, which the publisher donates to the worms.He encourages the slow-reading, the consideration of his text by direct challenge: I am beginning to be sorry that I ever undertook to write this book. Not that it bores me; I have nothing else to do; indeed, it is a welcome distraction to eternity. But the book is tedious, it smells of the tomb, it has a rigor mortis about it; a serious fault, a yet a relatively small one, for the great defect of this book is you, reader. And the slow-reading, the thoughtful consideration pays off. Language. Camaraderie with the narrator (unreliable, and frequently unlikeable, as he is) wins us over. A constant source for highlighting and reflection. The best way to not be \u2018the great defect\u2019 is to read this one as the narrator reads himself. Savory.\n__________________________________\n Imagine, if you will, this title said aloud, with an accent of one type or another: do you hear, \u201cEpitaph for a Small Weiner?\u201d I feel a certain amount of shame mentioning this, however the narrator does , on several occasions, express concern over his \u2018small sword\u2019 while Napoleon had a \u2018large sword.\u2019 Just something to think about, but not for all that long."}, {"userName": "Garima", "userReviewDate": "Sep 14, 2013", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/7915003-garima", "userReview": "... this book is written with apathy, with the apathy of a man now freed of the brevity of the century, a supinely philosophical work, of an unequal philosophy, now austere, now playful, something that neither builds nor destroys, neither inflames nor cools, and, yet, it is more than a pastime and less than an apostolate.My Goodreads morning started on an emotional note today. I logged in and found a book recommendation by Ali, friendly comments from Dolors and Dustin, the surprised mention of my name in Manny\u2019s review and lovely messages in the inbox. What more could I have asked for? The update feed however, presented a different and grim story altogether. A chilling reminder about the unfavorable direction this site is heading towards. A site which is of, by and for the readers. Good readers, Great readers, readers without whose recommendations and reviews, I wouldn\u2019t be the reader, I\u2019m today. Emotions surged up when I started imagining the what ifs scenarios and when you dedicate a huge chunk of your time to a virtual world, the happenings in that world whether positive or negative, affects you in incommensurable proportions. It\u2019s affecting me too and I would like to extend my heartiest thanks to each and everyone who are raising their voice in protest and hope that whatever happens the good reader in you will persevere and find blissful solace in wonderful books.May I recommend The Posthumous Memoirs of Bras Cubas? Death is inevitable and melancholy is alright but what fun to have an everlasting smile pasted on your face while reading a book. Bras Cubas is dead but gifted us all these wonderful posthumous memoirs. Why Posthumous? Probably our narrator, a supposed alter-ego of our author was seeking a full-fledged creative freedom and wanted to break all the rules of writing that must be in practice during his time. The year was 1880 and Joaquim Maria Machado de Assis gave us this enchanting literary treat which surely holds the power to fascinate everyone of us in the present world of countless genres and sub-genres. \n He had no other philosophy. Nor did I. I'm not saying that the university hadn't taught me some philosophical truths. But I'd only memorized the formulas, the vocabulary, the skeleton. I treated them as I had Latin: I put three lines from Virgil in my pocket, two from Horace, and a dozen moral and political locutions for the needs of conversation. I treated them the way I treated history and jurisprudence. I picked up the phraseology of all things, the shell, the decoration ...\nThe truth in his humor, the irony in his innocent expressions and the wisdom in his reckless way of living life (while he lived), will make you instantly fall in love with Cubas. He\u2019s not perfect but he\u2019s perfectly human. The writer in him finds a way of telling us his witty intentions without sticking to conventions as apparent in the following quotes: What looks like a simple inventory here are notes I'd taken for a sad and banal chapter that I won't write. I found in her a certain ethereal softness wedded to the polish of earthly forms\u2014a vague expression and worthy of a chapter in which everything must be vague.Few tears, lots of laughs and random sighs - the life viewed from the other side of the grave is not sieved through the judgmental eyes of the people around us but comes across in an unadulterated form consists of memories collected, mistakes committed and admissions of guilt in the confession box of our hearts and in retrospect, the life appears to be beautiful. Cubas tells us that and that\u2019s what we should tell ourselves while we are living. Believe me, remembering is the least evil. No one should trust present happiness, there's a drop of Cain's drivel in it. With the passing of time and the end of rapture, then, yes, then perhaps it's possible really to enjoy, because between these two illusions the better one is the one that's enjoyed without pain."},

"http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/4119460-aubrey", "userReview": "The reader, like his fellows, doubtless prefers action to reflection, and doubtless he is wholly in the right. So we shall get to it. However, I must advise that this book is written leisurely, with the leisureliness of a man no longer troubled by the flight of time; that is a work supinely philosophical, but of a philosophy wanting in uniformity, now austere, now playful, a thing that neither edifies nor destroys, neither inflames nor chills, and that is at once more of a pastime and less than a preachment.\nThe more I read, the more I come to understand that the trait I admire most in authors is not so much a matter of elegant prose, complex plots, characters that leap off the pages and make their home in your heads when the last page has been turned and the story has ended. Those are all very entertaining in their own right, but clever is as clever does, and rarely provokes long-lasting admiration in my mind. What I prefer is a simple matter of trust, belief, faith even if that is the direction your theological tendencies swing. Faith of the author in themselves, but more importantly, enough faith in their audience to lead them without expounding, carry them along in the pages without tending to their every need and pandering to their every expectation.Some would disagree with me on that point. In fact, many would, all those folks who dislike books for \"trying too hard\" and \"being too smart\". Those who feel that the author did not adhere to the formula enough to guarantee formulaic enjoyment of the audience, and decry them for leading them out of their literary comfort zones and making them confront a strange beast of ink and paper. Oftentimes they look at this weird creature and see something of themselves inside it. Sometimes this bothers them. More frequently than you'd expect, this scares them.So what does this have to do with this book here, you ask? Good question. I haven't quite figured it out myself, actually. At least, not at this exact point in time, as I type down these words in the middle of a coffee shop, the book itself on my right and a list of its quotes on the left. That's why you're here. You're joining me on this journey, the goal of which is to find the purpose of conducting in the first place. Circular, no? But true.What this book achieves is an astounding thing in this current age, but even moreso when one takes into account the year of publication. 1880, two years after The Brothers Karamazov and four years before The Adventures of Huckleberry Finn. If you asked me which is more closely related to this particular specimen, I'd have to say TBK. But only in terms of the wealth of philosophical content, the exacting and measured analysis of the human condition, the grappling with questions of success, reputation, and mortality. TBK tells you a story in a sonorous tone, preaches from the pulpit of its well-deserved yet greatly intimidating authorial presence. This book hops up on the stand, poses with hand on hip, says a few words in a serious tone, then quickly hops down and invites you to the back table to ruminate and reminisce over a few choice bottles of the finest vintages. There is a man behind the curtain, and he doesn't bother to pretend that he doesn't know that you know that he knows it's there. Instead, he welcomes you into his humble abode, and asks if you wish to hear a story. And trust me, reader, you really should say yes. Why? Why do we want to hear this story from this author, one who breaks off from all conventions in serving us what cannot at all be deemed a novel? One hundred and sixty bits and pieces of one, perhaps, but how could that possibly flow as strongly and as soothingly as a single entity, one that admittedly breaks off into chapters but ensures that each chapter is a well-rounded stepping stone to the next? Instead, we have this book, whose sections sometimes contain no more than a paragraph, a single sentence, even at some point a series of dots (or ellipses? Impossible to tell). How can a story possibly be told in such an erratic and incomprehensible fashion?Through conscientious and deliberate interaction of the author with his audience, who predicts their interests and invites them to go beyond them. Through knowledgeable understatement, conveying through simple events powerful ideas on life, love, and the death that the author supposedly composes in, without once feeling the need to paint an obvious map for the reader to jerk themselves around on. Through a measured and insightful eye on the actions of the main character, creating a man that dwells on deep thoughts without realization and dismisses them for frivolities and pleasure, yet is incontrovertibly shaped by the powerful undertow. A man who is both infuriatingly obtuse and startlingly sensitive, capable of both great cruelty and great understanding. A man who lived without effort, and died before making an effort. A man, now dead, writing of a life that he felt was lived without achieving any measure of great suffering, or amount of great joy.Perhaps he never did acquire those things he longed for so long in life. He did, however, find one thing: a small amount of truth in his life, one that reconciled his mortality with his visions of success, and contented him with living in constant and clear-sighted observation of himself and of others. The character may have never realized the beauty of his thoughts, the wonderful philosophies he drew from a privileged, yet empty living. I believe, however, that the author trusted us enough to discover those for ourselves. However much he played with us during the course of the pages, flattering our sensibilities while baffling our literary conventions, he trusted us to go through his pages and discover something on our own, for our own. That something, however small, is worth everything."}, {"userName": "Miss Ravi", "userReviewDate": "May 30, 2016", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/21314656-miss-ravi", "userReview":

Dec\u00eda que, a pesar de su originalidad aparente (la obra recoge las memorias escritas desde ultratumba por un difunto), no pasaba de un vulgar relato enmarcado en la corriente del Realismo. Estoy en desacuerdo con esa opini\u00f3n. Tengo idea de que a Machado de Assis se le puede enmarcar en dicha corriente, pero no sin especificar que se trata de un representante muy original.La idea de que un muerto escriba libros no era enteramente nueva. Hace tiempo, yo ya hab\u00eda le\u00eddo un panfleto publicado en la Lisboa de 1808, en plena invasi\u00f3n francesa, que me pareci\u00f3 interesante: Carta Escrita do Outro Mundo por William Pitt ao Imperador Napole\u00e3o (download del PDF desde: https://ia600500.us.archive.org/22/it... ).Y, por no ir m\u00e1s lejos, los miembros de la actual Iglesia Universal del Reino de Dios tienen textos sagrados que aseguran haber sido escritos por difuntos. Ahora bien, Machado de Assis llev\u00f3 bastante lejos esta idea, y me parece que supera con creces la curiosa an\u00e9cdota de 1808.Por otro lado, cuesta enmarcar este libro en el mismo tono narrativo de La se\u00f1ora Bovary o La Regenta. En primer lugar, porque Machado de Assis hace gala de un estupendo sentido del humor que no se prodiga tanto en los cl\u00e1sicos que menciono. Y, en segundo, por el elemento fant\u00e1stico de lo p\u00f3stumo. Claro que el Realismo no es completamente hostil a lo fant\u00e1stico. Gald\u00f3s escribi\u00f3 en su juventud varias obras de ese g\u00e9nero (recomiendo La sombra). Y Clar\u00edn, por ejemplo, el relato breve El diablo en Semana Santa, que recoge las travesuras de un demonio que visita la catedral de una ciudad de provincias.En su condici\u00f3n de \u201cmemorias\u201d, la novela tiene un tono diletante de quien tiene toda la eternidad para divagar. La acci\u00f3n transcurre a saltos y est\u00e1 plagada de digresiones. Traduzco del original portugu\u00e9s un trecho representativo:Empiezo a arrepentirme de este libro. No es que \u00e9l me canse; yo no tengo qu\u00e9 hacer; y, realmente, expedir algunos flacos cap\u00edtulos para el mundo siempre es tarea que distrae un poco de la eternidad.

T\u00fa tienes prisa por envejecer, y el libro va despacito; t\u00fa amas la narraci\u00f3n directa y nutrida, el estilo regular y fluido, y este libro y mi estilo son como los borrachos, que se desv\u00edan a diestro y siniestro, andan y paran, refunfu\u00f1an, berrean, se carcajean, amenazan al cielo, se resbalan y caen\u2026.Nada m\u00e1s definitorio de la falta de linealidad que lleva esta narraci\u00f3n\u2026Para acabar, mencionar\u00e9 tambi\u00e9n el disparatado invento de la corriente filos\u00f3fica que inicia uno de los personajes: el \u201cHumanitismo\u201d. Esta ideolog\u00eda viene a entreverarse con la acci\u00f3n en los cap\u00edtulos finales del libro, y me ha recordado al descabellado pensamiento \u201cfilos\u00f3fico\u201d que se entreteje con la trama del on\u00edrico El tercer polic\u00eda, escrito casi un siglo despu\u00e9s por el humorista irland\u00e9s Flann O\u2019Brien.Para ser una obra decimon\u00f3nica, me parece un libro que apunta a vanguardias posteriores."}, {"userName": "Tony", "userReviewDate": "Jan 10, 2014", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/33771-tony", "userReview": "How could I not want to read this?First, there is the absolutely gorgeous jacket design, including this painting, Young Man with a Pen by Diego Rivera:Second, Mike Puma recommended this. Mike is the go-to guy for Latin American literature.And then, in an introduction (by Bras Cubas), the author announces that he has \"adopted the free-form of a Sterne or a Xavier de Maistre\" in the writing of these Memoirs.Well, saddle me up and call me Tristram.Machado de Assis has indeed captured Sterne, down to the experimental font and digressions. He talks to the reader about what each is doing. Although, unlike Sterne, who delightfully talks to a female reader, Machado de Assis here chats with \"the gentleman reading me.\" But our boy Tristram was well-intentioned, even likable. The World just befell him. Bras Cubas, conversely, is amoral, maybe immoral. He was a shitty kid and grew into a rather shitty grown-up. After his treatment of slaves, women in general, and family members, his late life cuckolding of a friend actually serves as his one vulnerable moment. I would recommend this to readers who liked that Sterne changed things, and want to know how writing changed as a result. Or if you're just wanting to finally read a Brazilian author.I liked this. I liked this, Mike! The writing was fine, but the effort did not live up to the promise of the book's beauty. Apropos of that nonsensical remark, here is the author's cogitation over a Bibliomaniac:The worst part is the absurdity. The man stays there, hunched over the page, a lens under his right eye, given over completely to the noble and wearing function of deciphering the absurdity. He's already promised himself to write a brief report in which he will relate the finding of the book and the discovery of the sublimity if there is to be one under that obscure phrase. In the end he discovers nothing and contents himself with ownership. He closes the book, looks at it, looks at it again, goes to the window and holds it up to the sun. A one-and-only copy. At that moment, passing under the window is a Caesar or a Cromwell on the path to power. He turns his back on him, closes the window, lies down on his hammock, and slowly thumbs through the book, lovingly, wallowing hard . . . A one-and-only copy! _____ _____ _____ _____ _____*Seriously. Google Diego Rivera. Really amazing paintings. **I said at the beginning of this review that this is a beautifully designed book. The publishers were meticulous in making it so.

Absolutely", "userReviewDate": "Aug 03, 2010", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/2156200-k-d-absolutely", "userReview": "Strangely fascinating. I am no expert in literature and only started reading \"serious\" fiction works a couple of years back in my quest to read all those works included in 1001 Books You Must Read Before You Die by Dr. Boxall.Therefore, at first, I did not know how to react to this kind of literary work. Some say it is a novel but the author, the Brazilian Joaquim Maria Machado de Assis (1839-1908) says that is is a memoir. However, a memoir is supposed to be fiction. But how could this be fiction if it was written by the protagonist, the Brazilian rich and indolent Bras Cubas after his death? Dead people cannot write a novel unless they can talk to a writer who will, in trance, tinker what they say on his keyboard for many, many creepy nights. De Assis made use of a dead narrator, Bras Cubas, so that he (De Assis) will have a freedom to say what he wants to say, free from the responsibilities of the living. Death offers him the indolence of eternity (p. 209). The fact of being already deceased allows Br\u00e1s Cubas to sharply criticize the Brazilian society and reflect on his own disillusionment, with no sign of remorse or fear of retaliation.\n(p.52) But in death, what a difference! What a release! What freedom! Oh, how people can shake off their coverings, leave their spangles in the gutter, unbutton themselves, undecorate themselves, confess flatly what they were and what they've stopped being! Because, in short, there aren't anymore neighbors or friends or enemies or acquintances or strangers. There's no more audience. The gaze of public opinions, that sharp and judgmental gaze, losses its virtue the moment we tread the territory of death. I'm not saying that it doesn't reach here and examine and judge us, but we don't care about the examination or judgment. My dear living gentlemen and ladies, there's nothing as incommensurable as the disdain of the deceased.\n This however, is not an original idea. De Assis himself admitted that this style of freewheeling narrative was inspired by Laurence Sterne (1713-1768) particularly the latter's The Life and Opinions of Tristam Shandy. The Afterword of the edition (The Library of Latin American series) I have says that the De Assis's generation of Brazilian writers were greatly influenced by French earlier masters. This was during the middle 19th century when Brazil veered away from Portugal that was their main ally and greatly influenced their country prior to its opening to European countries.The setting is in Rio de Janeiro, during that period, i.e., mid 19th century. The novel opens with the actual interment of tne 64-y/o Bras Cubas who ironically died of pneumonia after discovering an antihypochodriacal poultice medicine. He started to tell his tale from childhood, through his series of failed love affairs, his attempt to become a politician, etc up to his eventual death.The book is divided into several short erratic chapters shifting in tone and style. My favorite is XXXI entitled The Black Butterfuly. The scene is after the death of Bras Cubas's mother and he was visited by a black butterfly. Bras is not superstitious so he strikes the poor butterfly with a towel while on top of his father's portrait with a towel. In the Philippines, we all believe that a butterfly or even a dragonfly, in whatever color, appearing after the death of a loved one is actually the soul of that person. I remember that a brown dragonfly stayed on the windshield of my car few days after the death of my father in September 1997. That dragonfly stayed there on top of my sideview mirror while I was traversing the lenght of the South Expressway (SLEX) not minding the strong wind and dusts. The unique use of erratic chapters shifting in tone and style in this realist novel that also uses surreal devices of metaphor and playful narrative construction (source: Wiki), at times can also be confusing. What is funny is that De Assis anticipated this by including a short chapter LXXI entitled The Defect of this Book\n I'm beginning to regret this book. Not that it bores me, I have nothing to do and, really, putting together a few meager chapters for that other world is always a task that distracts me from eternity a little. But the book is tedious, it has the smell of grave about it; it has a certain cadeveric contraction about it, a serious fault, insignificant to boot because the main defect of this book is you, reader. You're in a hurry to grow old and the book moves slowly. You love direct and continuous narration, a regular and fluid style, and this book and my style are like drunkards, they stagger left and right, they walk and stop, mumble, yell, cackle, shake their fists at the sky, stumble, and fall...And they do fall! Miserable leaves of cypress of death, you shall fall like any others, beautiful and brilliant as you are. And, if I had eyes, I would shed a nostalgic tear for you. This is the great adventure of death, which if it leaves no mouth with which to laugh, neither does it leave eyes with which to weep... You shall fail\"\nIf you don't find those lines strangely fascinating, I don't know what lines in any other book would have that impact to you.My edition of this book was published by The Library of Latin America. Their series of books makes available in translation major nineteen-century authors whose work has been neglected in the English-speaking world.I am thankful to The Library of Latin America for bringing De Assis available to English-only readers like me. I look forward to knowing more obscure Latin American writers like the brilliant Joaquim Maria Machado de Assis.

Writing in the late 1800s, De Assis is the Pushkin of Brazil - the father of their literature. Traces of metafictional Borges and magical realism can be seen. He doesn't so much break the fourth wall as refuse to acknowledge its existence. His narrators, his world, the very idea that you're reading a book, are all unreliable.  \"And now watch the skill, the art with which I make the greatest transition in this book,\" he says, before making a totally awkward transition...Strip away the tricks and Posthumous Memoirs of Bras Cubas - also known as Epitaph of a Small Winner - tells a small story. A guy leads an uneventful life. There's a love interest. Stars are crossed. The action is conventional. But you could say the same about Ulysses, and where would that get you? The book isn't about the story - it's about the book. It's narrated from beyond the grave. Bras Cubas rambles, aggrandizes himself, changes his mind. \"Maybe I'll leave out the previous chapter,\" he says. \"Among other reasons because in the last lines there's a phrase that's close to being nonsense.\" Then he singles you out - \"seventy years from now, [you] leans over the previous page to see if [you] can discover the nonsense.\" I laughed because I'd just finished doing exactly that. I have no way of knowing if Bras Cubas actually did leave the previous chapter out.I like Dom Casmurro best; the actual plot engages me more.

He was a prolific author that, strangely, not a lot of people have heard about, and I'm not sure why. He wrote The Posthumous Memoirs of Br\u00e1s Cubas in 1881, but if you picked this up without realizing that and just read it now, you would likely it think it had actually been written in the last fifty years.There's a freshness to his writing that holds up well today. I was nervous at first because I knew it was only just a little over 200 pages but someone referenced the fact that there are 160 chapters. I couldn't imagine how that would work out. But it... does, it really does. Some of the chapters are extremely short, some really don't say anything at all, and some are referenced in later chapters as possibly removed, but we don't really know if that is the case in the final book or not.Basically Machado de Assis likes to play with his readers. It's a game to him, and he had the foresight to realize that we could be reading him far, far down the line. I mean, what's funnier than fucking with a bunch of futuristic dicks? I think that was his plan all along. The idea amused him.Also amusing to him, evidently, was telling the story from the point of view of a deceased character. This is another indication Machado de Assis was ahead of his time. I was reminded at times during this of Jose Saramago's Death with Interruptions which I read a few months ago. I would say Saramago was likely influenced by Machado de Assis, though the latter did it better in the late 19th century than Saramago did in the 21st.I will be reading more by Machado now. I especially want to read Quincas Borba since he was a character in this book, and I'm curious to see what Machado does with him ten years later."}, {"userName": "\u00cdris", "userReviewDate": "Jan 14, 2015", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/14828516-ris", "userReview": "N\u00e3o vou alongar muito esta avalia\u00e7\u00e3o.Mem\u00f3rias P\u00f3stumas de Br\u00e1s Cubas, se n\u00e3o me engano, foi o segundo ou terceiro livro que li de um autor brasileiro (sendo os outros dois de Paulo Coelho).O livro \u00e9 escrito na vis\u00e3o de Br\u00e1s Cubas, um homem que j\u00e1 morreu e decidiu contar a hist\u00f3ria da sua vida - que n\u00e3o \u00e9 assim t\u00e3o interessante - por, talvez, a vida ser demasiado aborrecida do outro lado.Conta, maioritariamente, sobre os seus amores e desencontros.Houve, no geral, duas coisas que ficaram esclarecidas quanto ao meu gosto:Gostei da escrita e da forma por vezes ir\u00f3nica, sarc\u00e1stica e at\u00e9 despreocupada com que contava algumas das suas aventuras, mas, principalmente, e se n\u00e3o for considerado spoiler, achei extrema gra\u00e7a a este cap\u00edtulo:Cap\u00edtulo 136 - InutilidadeMas, ou muito me engano, ou acabo de escrever um cap\u00edtulo in\u00fatil.E, mesmo sendo um cap\u00edtulo t\u00e3o curto, fiquei t\u00e3o at\u00f3nita com a aud\u00e1cia de um escritor do s\u00e9culo XIX (sendo que, normalmente tinham bem mais modos e etiqueta do que temos hoje em dia) que fiquei a olhar para o cap\u00edtulo durante 5 minutos, estupefacta.Apenas n\u00e3o apreciei muito o enredo em geral.

Os bi\u00f3grafos notam que, interessado pela bo\u00e9mia e pela corte, lutou para subir socialmente abastecendo-se de superioridade intelectual. Para isso, assumiu diversos cargos p\u00fablicos, passando pelo Minist\u00e9rio da Agricultura, do Com\u00e9rcio e das Obras P\u00fablicas, e conseguindo precoce notoriedade em jornais onde publicava suas primeiras poesias e cr\u00f3nicas.

A obraBr\u00e1s Cubas, perece. Deitado no caix\u00e3o, observa as pessoas que o est\u00e3o a velar. Olhando para os rostos de cada um, vai contando as suas mem\u00f3rias, em jeito de balan\u00e7o com o divino, vai narrando as suas aventuras e desventuras.Filho de Var\u00e3o, privava nas mais altas ins\u00edgnias da sociedade brasileira. Durante a inf\u00e2ncia tudo lhe foi permitido, e tudo, era literalmente tudo, travessuras, malcriadezas, abusos, sem qualquer castigo ou corre\u00e7\u00e3o, tal como ele diz: \u201cmeu pai iria buscar o sol se eu lhe pedisse\u201d. Da\u00ed que se tornou um bom \u201cviv\u00e3\u201d, estudou o m\u00ednimo dos m\u00ednimos, n\u00e3o valia o esfor\u00e7o porque o estatuto \u201cd\u00e1 o seu jeito\u201d e, l\u00e1 conseguiu doutorar-se em Coimbra, trabalhar n\u00e3o fazia parte das suas prioridades de vida, namorar, isso sim, com certeza, verdadeiras paix\u00f5es, amava as mulheres casadas.O pai, queria ver o filho casado e deputado, acalentava o sonho de o ver na corte, a subir a escadaria da fama at\u00e9 se sentar na cadeira de ministro ou, quem sabe da presid\u00eancia, mas na corte, defendendo brilhantemente os seus ideais. De maneira que tratou de \u201carranjar\u201d casamento conveniente, convence o filho a casar-se com Virg\u00edlia. Br\u00e1s Cubas, contrariado l\u00e1 aceitou o neg\u00f3cio, mas, eis que surge Lobo Neves e lhe rouba e noiva e consequentemente o lugar de deputado.Agastado pelo sucedido o pai morre, e Br\u00e1s Cubas passa os dias, semanas, meses e anos encafuado na alcova de Virg\u00edlia (a esposa de Lobo Neves). Agora n\u00e3o conto mais, sen\u00e3o perde toda a gra\u00e7a.

Ou seja, o livro \u00e9 um marco na literatura brasileira, n\u00e3o apenas por ser do \"pai\" da sua literatura, mas por ter aqui iniciado, na sua escrita e na do Brasil, todo o seu Realismo. Na l\u00edngua portuguesa, tinha E\u00e7a iniciado o movimento, com \u201cO Crime do Padre Amaro\u201d (1875), ao que Machado n\u00e3o foi indiferente, tal como n\u00e3o vinha sendo indiferente a Zola e Flaubert. Esta obra de Machado de Assis \u00e9 assim o primeiro tomo da trilogia realista do autor, a que se sucedeu \"Quincas Borba\" (1891) e \"Dom Casmurro\" (1899).Tendo em conta a inova\u00e7\u00e3o procurada por Machado de Assis nesta obra, com toda a mudan\u00e7a de registo operada, \u00e9 natural que no texto se sintam fragilidades, como se sentem na obra de E\u00e7a. Estamos a falar de experimenta\u00e7\u00e3o, da procura de novos modos, o que implica sempre falhar para conseguir ir al\u00e9m. N\u00e3o estou com isto a dizer que a obra \u00e9 falhada, longe de mim, antes quero dizer que lhe falta alguma fluidez, algum ritmo, mas que acaba sendo compensado pelo modo como apresenta o seu realismo, com um narrador, diria agressivo, que nunca deixa o leitor em paz, que assume um constante vai-e-vem entre o espa\u00e7o ficcional e a nossa realidade. Algo que em minha opini\u00e3o adv\u00e9m da experimenta\u00e7\u00e3o com o real, parecendo a momentos, n\u00e3o estarmos a ler um romance, mas um texto n\u00e3o ficcional, mas que por outro lado Machado torna praticamente imposs\u00edvel com a premissa de partida, em que o narrador que conta a sua hist\u00f3ria est\u00e1 morto, o que por sua vez parece tamb\u00e9m querer aproximar-se de um certo realismo m\u00e1gico que viria a surgir em for\u00e7a na Am\u00e9rica Latina do s\u00e9culo XX.Para quem quiser aprofundar a leitura, existe muito por onde se iniciar, desde logo porque o texto est\u00e1 pejado de refer\u00eancias, desde Shakespeare a Stendhal, passando por Homero, Virg\u00edlio, Erasmo, Schopenhauer, Bocage, Sterne at\u00e9 \u00e0s \u201cMil e Uma Noites\u201d. Sobre a obra em si, muito, mas mesmo muito existe, leituras entretanto realizadas capazes de encontrar tra\u00e7os referenciais desde a sua estrutura \u00e0 filosofia apresentada na figura de Quincas Borba. Nada que nos admire, j\u00e1 que se o livro foi recebido com algum desconfian\u00e7a, muito motivado pelo que dissemos acima sobre a experimenta\u00e7\u00e3o e o novo, a verdade \u00e9 que Machado de Assis viria a fundar a Academia Brasileira de Letras em 1897, sendo o seu primeiro presidente.Publicado no VI: http://virtual-illusion.blogspot.com/..."}, {"userName": "Nate D", "userReviewDate": "Feb 14, 2011", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/406701-nate-d", "userReview": "This is the autobiography of a fictional dead writer -- not a writer who is dead, our narrator observes but a dead man who is writing, recounting his story from beyond the grave. That his story is so ordinary in its arc of 19th-century gentry romance and petty political aspiration just allows him to fill its margins with incisive observation, philosophizing both expansive and bitterly cynical, and darkly playful post-modern games -- chapters designed to explain other chapters or themselves, a chapter entirely blotted out, chapters that we are told have been removed from the book even within their own text, all designed to convey the story's vicissitudes all the more sharply.Wait, post-modernism? In 1880? In Brazil?! Yes. Machado de Assis was the son of a house painter and a washerwomen, born in 1839, and essentially a self-taught man of letters beyond the five years of public school (or its mid-19th century Brazilian equivalent). After some years of more time-typical romantic novels and stories, a period of illness gave him the urgency to break with any prior tradition to create Epitaph of a Small Winner, seemingly an attempt to capture the basic sadness of ordinary existence with grace and dry humor. And a level of formal innovation pretty much unsurpassed in its time, totally in service of his story. (Disclaimer: I've not read Tristam Shandy or Don Quixote, both of which I'm told have some of the same elements of pre-modern post-modernism).Admittedly, the actual story of this book is not so exciting. As I said before: pretty ordinary threads of romance and politics. And our posthumous narrator, who Assis seems to have made a full generation older than himself and a somewhat complacent inheritor of privilege and wealth, is far less interesting than Assis himself. But his voice -- Assis' voice coming through him -- is completely amazing, and gives the book all of its thrill and charm and perceptive power.

This is a 19th century work so it's supposed to be the original. Problem is, it didn't come as new to me, having read before the 20th century bestseller \"Lovely Bones\" by Alice Sebold where a murdered girl narrates.There are similarities here with Machado de Assis' other masterpiece, \"Dom Casmurro\", both in the manner the narrators ended up (alone) and their principal female protagonists (gloriously feminine, but flawed). I couldn't give this a similar 5-star rating, however, because of me. Machado de Assis himself said so. I am the defect of this book--\"(T)he main defect of this book is you, reader. You're in a hurry to grow old and the book moves slowly.

His novels are both heartbreaking and comic; his limning of a colonial Brazil in flux is both perceptive and remarkably modern. The Posthumous Memoirs of Br\u00e1s Cubas is written as an autobiography, a chronicle of the erotic misadventures of its narrator, Br\u00e1s Cubas--who happens to be dead. In pursuit of love and progeny, Cubas rejects the women who want him and aspires to the ones who reject him. In the end, he dies unloved and without heirs, yet he somehow manages to turn this bitter pill into a victory of sorts. What makes Memoirs stand up 100 years after the book was written is Machado's biting humor, brilliant prose, and profound understanding of all the vagaries of human behavior.", "title": "The Posthumous Memoirs of Br\u00e1s Cubas", "url": "http://www.goodreads.com/book/show/87262.The_Posthumous_Memoirs_of_Br_s_Cubas", "average": 4.23, "cover": "https://images.gr-assets.com/books/1347602854l/87262.jpg", "reviews": 467, "authors": [{"url": "https://www.goodreads.com/author/show/22458.Machado_de_Assis", "name": "Machado de Assis"}, {"url": "https://www.goodreads.com/author/show/50060.Gregory_Rabassa", "name": "Gregory Rabassa"}], "type": ["Fiction", "Classics", "Cultural"], "outlinks": ["http://www.goodreads.com/book/show/87262.The_Posthumous_Memoirs_of_Br_s_Cubas", "http://www.goodreads.com/book/show/6751746-epitaph-of-a-small-winner", "http://www.goodreads.com/book/show/2183511.Epitaph_of_a_Small_Winner", "http://www.goodreads.com/book/show/15737194", "http://www.goodreads.com/book/show/1373584._", "http://www.goodreads.com/book/show/18485300-mezar-mdan-yaz-yorum", "http://www.goodreads.com/book/show/87264.Mem_rias_P_stumas_de_Br_s_Cubas", "http://www.goodreads.com/book/show/3062603-epitaph-of-a-small-winner", "http://www.goodreads.com/book/show/7384467-mem-rias-p-stumas-de-br-s-cubas", "http://www.goodreads.com/book/show/4253867-the-posthumous-memoirs-of-br-s-cubas", "http://www.goodreads.com/book/show/31203548-mem-rias-p-sthumas-de-braz-cubas", "http://www.goodreads.com/book/show/1557614._", "http://www.goodreads.com/book/show/29485499", "http://www.goodreads.com/book/show/6723039-mem-rias-p-stumas-de-br-s-cubas", "http://www.goodreads.com/book/show/18665711-mezar-mdan-yaz-yorum", "http://www.goodreads.com/book/show/32058899-mem-rias-p-stumas-de-br-s-cubas", "http://www.goodreads.com/book/show/19093158-mem-rias-p-stumas-de-br-s-cubas", "http://www.goodreads.com/book/show/909746.Epitaph_of_a_Small_Winner", "http://www.goodreads.com/book/show/82888.Dom_Casmurro", "http://www.goodreads.com/book/show/87263.O_Alienista", "http://www.goodreads.com/book/show/87265.Quincas_Borba", "http://www.goodreads.com/book/show/425809.Helena", "http://www.goodreads.com/book/show/6383299-a-cartomante-e-outros-contos", "http://www.goodreads.com/book/show/39928984-mercy-among-the-children", "http://www.goodreads.com/book/show/20620995-take-me-with-you", "http://www.goodreads.com/book/show/6565401-five-quarters-of-the-orange", "http://www.goodreads.com/book/show/25600623-the-diver-s-clothes-lie-empty", "http://www.goodreads.com/book/show/18867378-the-traveler-s-gift", "http://www.goodreads.com/book/show/40198373-big-stone-gap", "http://www.goodreads.com/book/show/40198387-friendship-bread", "http://www.goodreads.com/book/show/40193401-the-little-giant-of-aberdeen-county", "http://www.goodreads.com/book/show/35963775-her-sister-s-shoes", "http://www.goodreads.com/book/show/22617980-the-rock-harbor-collection", "http://www.goodreads.com/book/show/35269080-a-thousand-tomorrows", "http://www.goodreads.com/book/show/40204902-caravans", "http://www.goodreads.com/book/show/31192689-shoeless-joe", "http://www.goodreads.com/book/show/40204877-a-hero-of-france", "http://www.goodreads.com/book/show/6473113-death-in-venice", "http://www.goodreads.com/book/show/40266651-the-tilted-world", "http://www.goodreads.com/book/show/33117501-blonde", "http://www.goodreads.com/book/show/36546758-ever-after", "http://www.goodreads.com/book/show/40193580-rescue", "http://www.goodreads.com/book/show/22032837-the-pearl-that-broke-its-shell", "http://www.goodreads.com/book/show/36589911-the-lords-of-discipline", "http://www.goodreads.com/book/show/11963271-the-sheltering-sky", "http://www.goodreads.com/book/show/25596951-the-dressmaker-s-war", "http://www.goodreads.com/book/show/35120598-gena-finn", "http://www.goodreads.com/book/show/29550710-a-charles-martin-collection", "http://www.goodreads.com/book/show/19977229-remember-tuesday-morning", "http://www.goodreads.com/book/show/8530701-a-town-like-alice", "http://www.goodreads.com/book/show/35414455-the-other-alcott", "http://www.goodreads.com/book/show/18800554-the-scavenger-s-daughters", "http://www.goodreads.com/book/show/40205036-under-the-udala-trees", "http://www.goodreads.com/book/show/32861105-the-streets-have-no-king", "http://www.goodreads.com/book/show/39929534-the-passion", "http://www.goodreads.com/book/show/35654710-this-dark-road-to-mercy", "http://www.goodreads.com/book/show/11513574-breath-eyes-memory", "http://www.goodreads.com/book/show/21942189-the-language-of-hoofbeats", "http://www.goodreads.com/book/show/18165412-house-of-bathory", "http://www.goodreads.com/book/show/37984397-we-own-the-sky", "http://www.goodreads.com/book/show/36004055-not-perfect"]}
