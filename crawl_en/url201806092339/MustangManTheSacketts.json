I loved it. I didn't think at first this was the book for me because it's a western, but I was so wrong. I got pulled into the story from page one. Louis L'Amour is wonderful at setting the stage and I was instantly drawn in. I found it to be a wonderful story, with lovable characters, and a brilliant plot. These books is lke the Lays potato chip commercials except \"You can't read just one.\" Since reading it, I have been searching out other books in the saga to read. I am now reading the 5th book \"Ride the River\" with Echo Sackett."}, {"userName": "Laura", "userReviewDate": "Nov 16, 2008", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/266845-laura", "userReview": "First book so far (from what I've read) told from the perspective of one of the Clinch Mountain Sacketts. Nolan was a surprisingly enjoyable character to follow, and I liked his woman. Again, the ending took my off guard, but I think it was mainly because I was listening to it. Since I can't see the pages as I'm getting toward the end, and since L'Amour tends to end abruptly, it sometimes takes me off guard. However, once I stopped and re-listened to the last minute or so again, I had a better feel for things."}, {"userName": "Sheri", "userReviewDate": "May 01, 2016", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/10926279-sheri", "userReview": "I wanted to read a Louis L'Amour book because he is my dad's favorite author, and I'm pretty sure he has read every single book he has released. I thought it would make my dad happy to read and know what his work is like, and I was right. Upon asking my dad which book I should read first as I didn't want to start with a dud and have a sour taste in my mouth from it, making me now want to read any more of his books. He suggested a couple of them, one being Mustang Man. I'm glad I started with this one, it was a pretty neat little read!I'll be honest, I didn't love this book, but I believe that I will not love any books of this genre simply for the fact that it's not \"up my alley.\" That doesn't mean that the experience was bad, or that the writing was bad or that I didn't like it at all, just that I probably will not pick up a L'Amour novel every chance I get. I did like that the story started right away, with one straightforward topic and multiple small conflicts. I didn't like that there was no character build-up or much of a backstory, but something tells me that the type of audience reading L'Amour westerns aren't looking for much of a character based novel anyway. Nolan Sackett is \"one bad motherfucker,\" as I texted my dad halfway through the book. His response was typical of my dad, \"the whole family are.\" He is clearly invested in the entire Sackett clan, which I find completely endearing! He's an honest, straight-shooting outlaw, but one with a kind heart and simple emotions, making it easy for him to do what he has to do to get done what he needs, or is paid, to get done. The story was easy to follow, nothing to decipher or analyze, and entertaining. This novel was a quick and fascinating read, but not my kind of genre. I'd give it a 3.5 star, simply because those of us who like to dive into an annoyingly analytical and deep type of read where we're reeling for days afterwards trying to figure out what the hell happened may not completely enjoy the simple kind of read this novel was. But if you're into westerns without any gushy romance, this is your kind of book and I recommend it!"}, {"userName": "Rub3n", "userReviewDate": "Apr 12, 2010", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/3575801-rub3n", "userReview": "this book is very interesting and action pact even though it the first sackett book that i had read it got my attention from the start.the criminal outlaw having a change of heart for the better and stoped being selfish as he guides a group of \"yellabellys\" through the old wild west.at first he was just doing it for the money then as he got to know the poeple he was guiding he became emotionly attached specially to a young women named penalope.later find out that the city poeple that hired him in search of gold that was to enherited hidden in an old mine but there not the only ones looking for gold.appeaerntly camanches know about it too so he hlps penalope thruogh the desert fighting off frequent run ins with camonches.but there are traders penolpes fiance is planning on running with the gold the first chance he gets nobody sees that but mr.sackett"}, {"userName": "Rich", "userReviewDate": "Jun 03, 2009", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/2205602-rich", "userReview": "I've always liked L'Amour's Sackett books, and have re-read them on several ocassions.

I not a fan of books about outlaws, however this is more a story of a bad boy that has just done what needs to be done to survive in the harsh and unforgiving west. Nolan is a wild boy from the Clinch Mountain region of Tennessee. His family is raised as independent and self sufficient individuals. They hunted, raised their own corps and handle their own problems. There was little law at the time.I have come to realize that Nolan has a big heart and like so many of the other Sacketts he just needs to find a good woman and a purpose for his life. Meeting the others of his extended family living in the west (THE SACKETT BRAND) has him considering settling down and learning to read and write.This is a story of gold and some really despicable relative of a nice young lady trying to find gold that her father buried long ago. Now some of these people really need to be out to the shed and read from the good book about manners and proper behavior. There are also some crotchety old men that have a good heart. It is amazing how gold can make people into idiots and thieves. There is a lot of action and riding across vast parts of the Panhandle of Texas and Eastern New Mexico. There are shoot outs and Indians and places that no one would know how to deal with at this time. I doubt most people in the west at this time would know much about natural gas. There is a scene that shows how explosive it can be.I really like this story and I am glad that at least one of the Clinch Mountain Sackett had a story written about him. I also like that there was a familiar character at the end of the story. I is always nice to get an update of a previous well known character. This is pure Louis L'Amour."}, {"userName": "Jean", "userReviewDate": "Nov 09, 2017", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/5802091-jean", "userReview": "Another book in the Sackett series, this features Nolan Sackett who is an outlaw with a heart of gold -- or is that a heart that lusts after gold?

My father introduced me to him when I was about 14 and was instantly hooked, the way his stories are told makes all other books seem boring and lifeless. I read every L\u2019Amour book I can find since then and this is a classic; it\u2019s filled with all the suspense, action, and adventure that you can expect from a normal western, along with just the right amount of romance. While you read this book there is never a dull moment: you will be on the edge of you seat the entire time. As is traditional in western books this one is easy and enjoyable to read. The main character, Nolan Sackett, thinks he can make some quick cash by guiding some tenderfoots out west, but once he begins the journey he realizes he has been suckered into a deadly race to find some long lost stolen gold. All his senses tell him to get cut his losses and leave, but between the thought of gold and a girl he is dragged into the race. The character of Nolan Sackett is everything a Sackett should be: strong, hard and made from the toughest stuff. Nolan is a Clinch Mountain Sackett that has never been on the right side of the law, but when an innocent girl and an injured old man need help finding the gold that is rightfully theirs, he doesn\u2019t give it a second thought. The villains were also something I had never encountered before in other novels: truly cold blooded killers. Sylvie and her brothers killed for no good reason, other than the fact that they could get away with it. I really enjoyed this because it was completely different than normal western outlaws who still have a sense of honor and respect when they fight. The only reason I would not give this book five stars is that I felt the character of the Penelope was a little boring. While it was a nice change to have a strong women character in it, but I felt that she wasn\u2019t brought to life the way most of L\u2019Amour\u2019s characters are. Other than that I thought the book was superb; the adventure was unique and well told, and the ending was as it should be: the good guy gets the gold and the girl and then rides off into the sunset. This would be a good read for any fan of westerns; however there are other Louis L\u2019Amour books that I have enjoyed more than this one."}, {"userName": "Suzanne Moore", "userReviewDate": "Mar 18, 2009", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/2127114-suzanne-moore", "userReview": "3-18Just started this audio-book today. Sackett is escaping a band of Mexicans and a noose on back of a stolen horse.Nolan Sackett is passing through Indian country, and comes across a wagon with a girl (Sylvie), her brothers (Ralph& Andrew). They are stranded without horses, and seem ready to kill Sackett for his ride. He is of course not going to let this happen. Not trusting them, he still agrees to go after their horses that have been led off by another cowboy. Later he rides through a war party of Kiowas, escaping only by not allowing them to see his fear. When stopping in a Mexican village, he agrees to guide a young girl (Penelope) along with her escorts Mr. Lumos and Flinch through the canyon. When he mentions the group he ran across, and his mistrust for them, his suspicions seem confirmed when he notices the expressions of alarm on their faces.3-19Nolan learns that Penelope is traveling in search of a gold inheritance, and Sylvie (near relative) heard about the treasure when listening to the reading of Penelope's grandmother's will. Sylvie will stop at nothing to get the gold, and it is beginning to seem as if Penelope's traveling partners may have hidden motives for escorting her. Nolan agrees to guide them to a place called \"Rabbit Ears,\" between two mountains, once there he is paid for his services and dismissed.3-22But, Nolan can't leave after thinking of the danger Penelope faces. He turns back and after a number of shooting confrontations with various parties, he rescues Penelope and they ride off together with the gold.La'mour didn't make Penelope seem so helpless towards the end, and I liked the fact that she stood up for herself and showed her strength.

And although I hadn't seen much of the Western shows in general what pieces and bits I have had glimpses matched this book so it pleads was Louis L'Amour the originator or did he follow Hollywood? Maybe it was both.... Anyway within the book itself there was a definite separate voice for the main character, which I enjoyed. Unfortunately it didn't seem the character voice was passed onto any of the other characters in the book so they remained flat and slightly interesting yet lifeless in the long run. I could truly agree that the author does know his land and how to describe what it was like to those of who won't get the opportunity to experience it. There was raw harshness but at the same time beauty, which is how the West always seems to be described. You get a sense of the isles of barely given justice and law that are barely meandering through a sea of survival law where a man's survival is based upon how he can get himself through his scrapes. Altogether it was an enjoyable reading experience, especially as a first of the genre. Not quite sure if I had read the series whether I may have come out with more, especially as the ending isn't complete. May have to keep an eye out for the next book or for another altogether to give it a try."}, {"userName": "Ed", "userReviewDate": "Apr 08, 2016", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/11566365-ed", "userReview": "#13 in the Sackett series chronologically, #6 in publication order.

I'm starting to get a tad tired of the formula that Louis sticks with in his characters:* They aren't any good with \"womanfolks\".* The conflict is always over gold.* The main character is a drifter.* The main character can't read.* The main character gets the girl.* The main character is moral to a fault.* Everyone is fantastic trackers.Just for once, I would like to read one of hist westerns that involves card players, or a bartender, or a shop keeper, a rancher, sheriff, something. Hopefully, out of the Sackett series, that happens.In this case, the main character is an \"outlaw\", yet full of moralities and honesty. You read about him previously in another novel, and you get the impression that he's anything but a boy scout. So, the discontinuity is hard to get past.
