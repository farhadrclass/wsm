I studied Kinesiology and nutrition at UC Berkeley. I \u2018knew\u2019 about trans fat and the value of Omega 3\u2019s .... years before most people knew the word. When I put my flax seeds into a grinder to sprinkle them on my salads or other foods just before eating - in the 1970\u2019s, people called me a hippie. I was far from one. Today....its not odd, but collectively if we live in the West....surrounded by temptations of The American ways of eating ....socially - emotionally - and spiritually- we each can benefit to check in within ourselves from time to time.....and ask ourselves.....\u201dhow are we doing with our eating\u201d? Our need for education and improvements are endless. Ever notice how each one of us are on own eating path today. Eating in our society is a complicated issue. BUT *sugar* .....the empty calorie ....( no matter how much we like it - which I admit has been my #1 drug of choice my entire life -the drug I\u2019ve had emotional and PHYSICAL battles with) ....is AS ADDICTING- more so - for some people - than cocaine- alcohol- or any other drug on the market. People who know they are sugar addicted - seriously addicted - know who they are. Many can\u2019t eat a drop of the white sugar crystals without real fear of setting themselves up for cravings sooo strong for more....it\u2019s all they can think about. MEAT - and VEGETABLES never cause THAT type of neurotic thinking. SUGAR can do that! There are also MANY GREAT BOOKS on the market which support - educate - and guide people to make healthy choices: So, if it\u2019s support for healthy eating - cook books or guide books - I can share a few that I believe are excellent...BUT THIS BOOK... \u201cThe Case Against Sugar\u201d.....probably the best book of its kind ... is The MOST researched. (its not a recipe book), Instead it is ....THE MOST historical book today that we have on the subject of sugar - scientifically proven - real evidence -that SUGAR is THE MAJOR NUMBER ONE DANGEROUS FOOD contributing to a wide range of diseases. Here are just a \u2018few\u2019 of those OTHER BOOKS that I own and highly endorse.( remember I studied nutrition and was certified as a nutritional consultant many years ago) - so my library is large.A few of my favorite books: \u201cClean Eating\u201d by Alejandro Junger,MD, \u201cThe Total Health Cookbook\u201d by Joseph Mercola, MD, The Blood Sugar Solution\u201d, by Mark Hyman MD, Joseph Mercola \u201cThe No-Grain\u201d diet, \u201cThe 21 Day Sugar Detox\u201d is NOT my favorite because I don\u2019t think people know how to use it right. \u2014-ANYTHING that says 21 days ... can be a set up for a failure. But the recipes are fine. I personally - in general - don\u2019t like that old American way of thinking \u2018quick fix\u2019.... The title alone feeds into account\u2018diet\u2019 way of thinking. But with awareness. .... the book \u2018might\u2019 work for some people. Often - it\u2019s a set up for the brain to want to be rewarded in 21 Days \u2014- but then that same brain will punish oneself six months later. \u2014- Personally I\u2019m just careful with anything that \u2018looks\u2019 or sounds like a diet. Other books I own and like are by: Gary Null\u2019s MD, Pam PeekeMD , Gabriel Cousens MD, GARY TAUBES.MOVING ONTO THIS BOOK.... There are some already excellent reviews. Cliff, your review is outstanding! Thank you! Gary Taubs is highly respected \u2014 his work is well researched. He has done a great service in explaining how SUGAR - TABLE SUGAR and high fructose corn syrup in particular have been a major contributor to a host of illnesses in Western society. This book covers the history - OF THE SUGAR INDUSTRY \u2014including its ties to big businesses- our government-and the tobacco industry. Anyone with type 2 diabetes or concerns about getting it .... might seriously read this book. The hardest thing to digest for me - in reading this book.....even though I believe there is a need for a complete change in thinking ---is completely changing the way we celebrate with our SWEET TREATS.....Perhaps one day .... we will no longer celebrate a child\u2019s birthday with cake or ice cream. Perhaps we really don\u2019t need to express our love to each other with a sweetie for our sweetie on Valentines. Maybe the Easter Bunny will deliver real eggs...and perhaps Santa Claus is fat enough and doesn\u2019t need any more cookies. How do we collectively support healthy changes? Little steps at a time .....\u201cTHE CASE AGAINST SUGAR\u201d..... could be a terrific non-fiction book club pick so that communication can take place about an issue that affects all us. SUGAR is THAT powerful in our every day lives.....but it\u2019s not an innocent bystander."}, {"userName": "Michelle Burton", "userReviewDate": "Jan 05, 2017", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/6011032-michelle-burton", "userReview": "Gary Taubes has done an excellent job in explaining why sugar is so terrible for the body. I am seeing a nutritionist to help me with my weight and on my last visit she stated to me that you can eat any food in moderation. My response to her was, \"What does moderation mean? I guess a person could smoke crack in moderation but no one recommends that.\" Taubes stated it clearly in his book that the people who say \"eat in moderation\" typically don't have a weight problem, (and my nutritionist does not) therefore what moderation looks like to one person would look totally different to another. For me, I am staying away from as much sugar as possible. It is in so much foods I don't know if I can totally abstain from it, but I can stop eating the main culprit of sugar delivery systems: candies, cookies, cakes, pop, fruit juices. Y'all, the stuff is deadly and toxic. My father lost a foot to diabetes and another family member kidneys recently failed due to diabetes and high blood pressure. Just like his book Good Calories, Bad Calories convinced me not to eat so much refine carbohydrates, The Case Against Sugar has convinced me to go cold turkey with sugar. Highly recommend all three of his books on nutrition if you want to be in the best health possible."}, {"userName": "Clif Hostetler", "userReviewDate": "May 02, 2017", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/793473-clif-hostetler", "userReview": "This book delves into Western civilization's history with sugar and its increasing rate of consumption since introduction of refined sugar into the Western diet. With this increased consumption also came the economic power of the sugar industry that throughout most of the twentieth century was the funder of nutritional research that tended to focus of causes for Western diseases in directions other that sugar itself.The rate of occurrence of diabetes, heart disease, gout, and a host of other chronic conditions pretty much parallels the rate of increase of sugar consumption. Throughout the twentieth century researchers seemed to want to blame saturated fats and cholesterol but had difficultly establishing links through subsequent health studies. Reluctance to distinguish between complex carbohydrates and simple sugar carbohydrate and refusing to accept the possibility of different metabolism routes for sucrose, fructose and other sugars made nutritional researchers blind to the possible role of sugar.In the manner of a good prosecuting attorney, Taubes in this book lays on layer after layer of additional evidence in making his case against sugar. This data is gleaned from medical history and multiple population studies of the relationship between the consumption of sugar with diabetes and then with all the other medical problems associated with diabetes. Today the American rate of diabetes is nearly one in ten adults, and approximately one in ten children are estimated to have nonalcoholic fatty liver disease which is a precursor of diabetes.I found particularly alarming the concept of \"perinatal metabolic programming\" (a.k.a. metabolic imprinting) as a hypothetical means by which succeeding generations may be more likely to develop diabetes, insulin resistance and metabolic syndrome than is true for today's population.The conditions in the womb\u2014in the intrauterine environment\u2014influence the development of the fetus, so that subtly different conditions will lead, in effect to the birth of newborns who respond differently to the environment they face outside the womb. In particular, the nutrients that the developing child receives in the womb\u2014including the supply of glucose\u2014pass across the placenta in proportion to the nutrient concentration in the mother's circulation. The higher the mother's blood sugar, the greater the supply of glucose to the fetus. The developing pancreas responds by overproducing insulin-secreting cells. \"The baby is not diabetic,\" says Roy Metzger, who studies diabetes and pregnancy at Northwestern University, \"but the insulin-producing cells in the pancreas are stimulated to function and grow in size and number by the environment they're in. So they start over-functioning. That in turn leads to a baby laying down more fat, which is why the baby of diabetic mother is typified by being a fat baby.\"I interpreted the above as probably leading to increased sensitivity to the detrimental effects of sugar. However, Taubes elsewhere says it may increase or decrease sensitivity, he's not sure which.I thought once Taubes had established the link between sugar and diabetes that he would be finished. But he proceeds to link heart disease to diabetes through the indirect link of insulin resistance and metabolic syndrome that leads to hypertension. He didn't stop there. He then proceeded to name sugar as the culprit in ALL Western diseases.... if sugar causes insulin resistance and elevates triglycerides and makes us fat, then it very likely causes hypertension, too\u2014if not directly, then at least indirectly, through its effect on insulin resistance and weight. Sugar is the culprit.So here's the if/then hypothesis: If these Western diseases are associated with obesity, diabetes, insulin resistance, and metabolic syndrome, which many of them are, then whatever causes insulin resistance and metabolic syndrome is likely to be the necessary dietary trigger for the diseases, or at least a key player in the causal pathway. Because there is significant reason to believe that sugars\u2014sucrose and high-fructose corn syrup in particular, the nearly fifty-fifty combinations of glucose and fructose\u2014are the dietary trigger of insulin resistance and metabolic syndrome, it's quite likely they are a primary cause of all these Western diseases, including ... cancer and Alzheimer's disease. Without these sugars in the diet, these chronic diseases would be relatively rare, if not, in some cases, virtually nonexistent.At this point Taubes proceeds to address the major Western diseases, one by one, to discuss the likelihood that sugar is responsible, or at least largely responsible. He proceeds to go into a detailed discussion of the hypothetical biochemical mechanisms by which ingestion of sugar can be linked to gout, hypertension, cancer and Alzheimer's disease. Taubes doesn't claim definitive proof according to the rules of science, and indeed it may never be possible to establish absolute proof. But Taubes has certainly laid out a string of circumstantial evidence and mechanisms by which simple sugars can lead to the Western diseases that I find compelling.Taube concludes with a discussion of what is the safe amount of sugar to eat. He says the answer is similar to the answer for tobacco. There is no safe amount for everyone. There are some population studies that have shown that when primitive cultures begin to eat the Western diet that problems begin to appear at about seventy pounds per capita per year of sugar consumption with a twenty year delay in the appearance of symptoms. The FDA in 1986 said forty-two pounds per capita per year was safe. (Current average per capita sugar consumption in USA is over 100 lb/year less losses from discarded food.) But that is a generalized amount for the total population and doesn't account for some individuals who may be maladapted to sugar. Furthermore, future populations may be more (or less) sensitive to sugar than in the past because of perinatal metabolic programming.Here's a link to an article about sugar addiction and withdrawal:https://www.weforum.org/agenda/2017/0...Here's a link to an NPR article titled, \"What The Industry Knew About Sugar's Health Effects, But Didn't Tell Us.\"https://www.npr.org/sections/thesalt/..."}, {"userName": "Emily Crow", "userReviewDate": "Jan 23, 2017", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/23080450-emily-crow", "userReview": "Guess what? Sugar is not a healthy food. Who knew? In fact, according to Gary Taubes, it causes just about every \"disease of Western civilization\" and we probably shouldn't eat it at all, which kind of reminded me of all the other nutrition doomsday books I've read over the years:The China Study...don't eat meat or dairy, you will get sick and dieWheat Belly...don't eat wheat, you will get sick and dieEat More, Weigh Less...don't eat fat, you will get sick and dieThe Paleo Solution or any other paleo book...don't eat grains or beans, you will get sick and dieSugar Blues...oh wait, that was sugar again. Two strikes against sugar.So I guess I need to hole up in my nutrition bunker with nothing but vegetables and salad greens, and wait out the food apocalypse, because there's nothing left to eat! But, in all seriousness, I think any reasonable person can concede that sugar--at least in the ginormous amounts it is consumed in our society--is pretty much bad for us. As to just how bad, Gary Taubes is here to explain, and I found a lot that was interesting or valuable in this book. I've read about sugar and metabolic syndrome (potentially leading to type II diabetes, heart disease and other things) before, but Taubes described the process convincingly, and I ran across a couple of new things, like the potential link between high sugar consumption and gout. I also enjoyed the first few chapters about the history of the sugar industry.The second half of the book was not as satisfying for me, though. For one thing, Taubes returned to a couple of his key issues that I've always been a bit skeptical of, such as a complete dismissal of the \"calories in/calories out\" equation for weight loss. I get that it is not quite that simple--a lot of things can go wonky with the metabolism, and the types of foods eaten do make a difference--but at a certain level, yes, if you eat less and/or exercise more, you WILL lose weight, and we all know people who have done that. And then there's the Ancel Keys bashing.... I get it, Taubes thinks Keys was completely wrong with his Seven Countries Study and theory of saturated fat causing heart disease, but honestly, his rancor towards the man comes across like a personal grudge match at times. Especially since I actually do respect Keys' contributions and as far as I'm concerned, the saturated fat versus sugar issue hasn't been resolved yet. Regardless, the Mediterranean diet that Keys ended up espousing is NOT high in sugar and, as far as population studies goes, appears to be quite healthful.Now maybe you are thinking that population studies are of limited use and that Keys cherry-picked the Seven Countries Study to prove his point, and you would be right. Which leads me to my main issue with this book, and why I couldn't give it higher than a three star rating--in the last couple of chapters, Taubes shamelessly cherry-picks population studies to prove his extreme anti-sugar point, focusing on tribal peoples such as the Pima Indians and certain Pacific Islanders. Much closer to home (and much closer to the DNA mix of most of his audience, I'm guessing), I could point out other, conflicting populations, such as the Amish, who eat a lot of sugar (and refined flour) and don't have anywhere near the levels of heart disease and diabetes as the rest of us....Another missed opportunity is that, while Taubes discusses the economics and politics of sugar in the past (even the recent past), he doesn't address the political landscape that has created our current sugar glut. I've lived three places where sugar crops are a major part of the local economy: Hawaii (sugar cane), central Michigan (sugar beets) and currently central Illinois (corn, a.k.a. high fructose corn syrup). I am surrounded by field upon field upon field of mono-crops of genetically modified, pesticide-laden corn, much of it bound for factories to be turned into HFCS and then splattered on just about every processed food in the market at cut-rate prices, so that junk foods are cheaper than fresh vegetables. Because of government farm subsidies. And then the taxpayers are socked again at the end of the cycle, paying for all the health care. But if we all stopped eating this crap, I don't even want to imagine the economic repercussions. It's a messed up system, and it's entirely relevant to the issue of why so many North Americans are sick and obese, and it's barely addressed in this book. Finally, towards the end of the book, the speculation and scare-mongering about sugar reached an almost ridiculous level. Implying that allowing a child to have a single scoop of ice cream per week would be unhealthy? Wondering if we have messed up our health for generations to come by eating sugar? At this point, I just stopped taking the author seriously.But I will admit, at one point he states that the people who say sugar is OK in moderation are the people who don't have a problem with it, and I guess I just proved his point. Despite my many dietary vices, I don't have much of a sweet tooth, and can enjoy a bit of dark chocolate or a creme brulee once in a while. Sugar isn't addictive for me, and I actually find the sweetness of many processed foods kind of off putting. So I guess I would say, if you feel \"hooked\" on sugar, then definitely read this book. Otherwise, it has a few interesting points but ultimately seems a bit overwrought to me."}, {"userName": "Bam", "userReviewDate": "Jan 02, 2017", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/5922426-bam", "userReview": "Having been on a zero-sugar diet for the past three weeks and planning to make it a lifestyle change (see my review of Zero Sugar Diet: The 14-Day Plan to Flatten Your Belly, Crush Cravings, and Help Keep You Lean for Life), I wanted to read a bit more about the science behind the claim that the added sugars in processed foods could possibly be the cause of the current obesity and diabetes epidemic. Intuition, common sense and observation tells one it is true but so many diet fads have come and gone, that a little healthy skepticism is warranted. This book does not provide proof but does give more food for thought (pun intended.) There are very few studies to back up any of this as the big clinical trial money has been focused on shoring up the theory that dietary fat is the main culprit so a leap of faith is still required, I'm afraid, but I have to feel we're on the right track with wholesome, more natural food. Sometimes the simple answer IS the correct one. \"Diet advice that recommends we eat whole foods and avoid processed foods (foodlike substances) remove virtually all refined sugar by definition; diet advice to avoid sugar means, by definition, that we avoid virtually all processed foods.\""}, {"userName": "Ita", "userReviewDate": "Jan 08, 2017", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/9888786-ita", "userReview": "\u2018Medicine is mostly taught untethered from its history,\u2019 asserts Gary Taubes at the beginning of this book. \u2018Students are taught what to believe, but not always the evidence on which their beliefs are based.\u2019This book is a much needed history of sugar. I can think of nowhere else where failure to look at the evidence on which medical beliefs are based has had, and continues to have, such tragic consequences.The leading authority who dominated the teaching about diabetes during the twentieth and into the twenty-first century was a dedicated doctor called Elliott Joslin. His textbook, \u2018The Treatment of Diabetes Mellitus was first published in 1916. Revered as a bible, its most recent edition appeared in 2005, forty-three years after his death. Joslin argued that fats, and not sugar, were the cause of diabetes. This belief was supported by Harold Himsworth, a very influential diabetes researcher based in London, who in 1931 proposed that a diet rich in carbohydrate should be recommended to diabetics. Both Joslin and Himsworth pointed to Japan as a country where the diet was rich in carbohydrate and low in fat, and where there was very little diabetes. What both men ignored was that sugar consumption in Japan at that time was comparable to that in England and America in the nineteenth century, when diabetes was very rare. They both assumed that sugar and other carbohydrates were equivalent in their effects on the human body.Sugar (sucrose) is formed in plants by the condensation of two simpler sugars \u2013 glucose and fructose. Glucose, the molecule into which starches are digested, is used to provide energy. Any surplus is converted, in the liver and muscles, to glycogen (\u2018animal starch\u2019) for storage until needed. Conversion of glucose to glycogen is under the control of the hormone insulin. Fructose, by contrast, is converted by the liver into fat. Its fat-forming effects seem to be enhanced when glucose is present.Joslin\u2019s and Himsworth\u2019s misconception might have been challenged by the research on metabolism, endocrinology, genetics and nutrition which was taking place in Germany and Austria before the Second World War. Post 1939 this very valuable work was lost to the scientific community. Nutritionists in the English-speaking world focussed on energy balance. A calorie was a calorie no matter where it came from. Putting on weight was simply a matter of consuming more calories than could be expended. Excess weight caused both diabetes and obesity. Diet and exercise were the solutions.When the technique of radioimmunoassay was developed in the 1960s, it brought with it the possibility of measuring hormone levels, and the problem of insulin resistance came to light. Unexpectedly, high insulin levels could accompany high levels of sugar in the blood. Insulin was no longer effective in moving glucose out of the blood and into cells. This pattern was found in people suffering from obesity, and in those who developed diabetes later in life. What caused insulin resistance was then a mystery. It has since been linked to sugar consumption.By the 1950s it was recognised that heart disease was associated with both diabetes and obesity. Whether too much fat or too much sugar caused heart disease was still an open question, and researchers were highly motivated to find an answer. The hypothesis that fat was the murder weapon was supported by the very wealthy and powerful Sugar Association with its Food and Nutrition Advisory Committee. The American Heart Association also came down on the side of fat. It advocated low fat diets for every American, while its researchers were admitting that the dietary fat/heart disease hypothesis needed much more investigation. Those who favoured the sugar hypothesis like John Yudkin in England faced ridicule and the charge of being quacks. In the 1960s Yudkin fed human subjects sugar-rich diets and reported that this increased their cholesterol and triglyceride levels. It seemed to ratchet up their insulin levels and even make their blood platelets sticky.Clinical trials were set up in the US and in Europe to test the fat, but not the sugar hypothesis. To date they have failed to show that high levels of dietary fat cause heart disease, obesity or diabetes. Nevertheless, in 1986 the American government and health organisations committed themselves to getting Americans to eat a low fat diet. Everyone else followed suit. The epidemic of diseases included in metabolic syndrome has only worsened.Gary Taubes cannot prove that sugar is the cause of Western chronic diseases, but the evidence he gives is overwhelming. I have concentrated on some of the scientific aspects, but this book contains much more. It is also as riveting as a good novel. Taubes\u2019 clarity of vision is very rare, and a book like this is worth its weight in gold."}, {"userName": "Kieran Se\u00e1n Fitzpatrick", "userReviewDate": "Apr 13, 2017", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/4442512-kieran-se-n-fitzpatrick", "userReview": "main take-aways: - a calorie is not a calorie.- fats in food are not bad.- sugar causes: diabetes, gout, cancer, bad breath, insomnia, restless leg syndrome, MRSA, depression, economic inequality, republicans, nazis, trump, and alzheimer's.- the sugar industry uses tactics similar to climate-change-deniers.- it is almost impossible to not eat sugar.- there is as much sense in eating a \"moderate amount\" of sugar as there is in smoking a \"moderate amount\" of cigarettes.it's not like any of these conclusions are hard to come by.the problem is that it takes so much effort _not_ to consume sugar."}, {"userName": "JDK1962", "userReviewDate": "Jan 02, 2017", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/83141-jdk1962", "userReview": "I happened to be reading this at the same time as I was listening to a three-part Freakonomics podcast series called \"Bad Medicine,\" and they both hit on the same problem: the emphasis upon \"eminence-based\" medicine, rather than evidence-based medicine, i.e., if a renowned practitioner is behind a hypothesis, that can be enough to direct, or at least influence, decades of research and practice. This is especially critical in the science of sugar, because Taubes' point is that the damage done by sugar is not something that can be easily researched. The damage--if it is indeed caused by sugar--takes not days or weeks but decades to manifest, and it would require literally billions of dollars of research to establish a firm scientific link. But the case that Taubes presents is pretty alarming, especially showing that, as aboriginal peoples are introduced to the \"Western diet,\" a host of \"Western diseases\" start showing up.Taubes' book does a good job of laying out the case, but perhaps falls short in a prescriptive sense. Eat less or no sugar is about the long and short of it. And of course, take the medical advice of those being funded by the sugar industry very, very skeptically. FYI, as someone who works in finance, I thought the quote from C.W. Barron, about investing in vices, was quite interesting, so I actually set up an index focusing on gambling, alcohol, tobacco, and carbonated beverage producers (setting up and testing indices is what I do for a living). In the period from 1999-2016, the annualized return was approximately 3X greater than the S&P500 over the same period, with lower standard deviation and drawdown, and higher Sharpe ratio and dividend yield.

One of the most hyperbolic, poorly researched (in terms of actual scientific studies) pieces of hysteria I have read in a long time. The accolades given to Gary Taubes are beyond confusing. His fervent advocacy supported by limited peer reviewed work and even junk science reminds me of another popular cause du jour, the anti-vaxxer movement. The fact that he has taken to consorting with a dangerous self-promoting snake oil salesman like anti-vaccine/anti-mammogram advocate Joe Mercola tells me all that I need to know about his agenda. It isn\u2019t for the betterment of society; it is to stake a claim in a controversial realm that will help enrich himself even if its foundation is built on a bold face lie. As for the book, the constant quoting of 50, 70 and even 100 plus year old newspaper articles or books, detailing the intricacies of how early cereal makers came to add sugar to their product or spending an annoying amount of time explaining how tobacco is processed doesn\u2019t make for actual science or a good read. All it does is give the illusion of it for those too ignorant or lazy to see past the dog and pony show that is The Case Against Sugar. If he spent more time reading actual peer reviewed research, or even conducted some himself, the book would have been better served. Instead he comes in with an agenda on page one and twist and shapes what little research he does present to ensure that it fits into his preconceived box, ignoring what isn't convenient to his argument and using massive amounts of fluff to fill in any gaps and draw unsubstantiated conclusions.On one hand the author claims that science has proved his theories as correct, (they haven\u2019t, in fact an institute he helped found argues against many of his beliefs, oops) and on the other he attacks any and every scientist that disagrees as being a shill for \u201cbig sugar\u201d. The outrageous claims he pushes (sugar has killed more people in the last century than war or guns) are ludicrous. He states early on that all, ALL, diseases are caused by sugar \u201cThere is clearly enough evidence to indict sugar as the single prominent environmental trigger of disease,\u201d. This sets the stage to be able to make the previous claim that big sugar is essentially committing mass murder on a global scale using the declaration that it is the root cause as proof. All without providing any evidence to back either assertion up.Why after reading this book would anyone take him serious is beyond me. I would posit that most people aren\u2019t actually \u201creading\u201d the book and understating what he says and, more importantly, doesn\u2019t say. But rather looking for an example to point to while they pat themselves on the back for being so enlightened. Look, we all know sugar is bad when consumed in large amounts. I guess it just isn\u2019t sexy enough to point out that we need to practice much better moderation as we should with all things. It is much easier to come out all crazy like screaming that the sky is falling and suggesting that the government make its use illegal.

We would never dream of giving kids alcohol or a cigarette, but sugar has nutritional value, so it's OK, right? Not exactly. I credit Dr. Oz for introducing me to the diseases of metabolic syndrome almost 20 years ago. In that episode he also talked about why sugar is so bad for you. Let me paraphrase: eating sugar is like having sharp razor blades tearing up your arteries. Well, that's an image that has never left me. Once I realized just how much sugar was in everything we ate, I removed most of the white and processed foods from our home. Most of the actual sugar too. However, I have a sweet tooth, and that's an understatement. I've given up on sugar, and fallen off the wagon, and then got on again. I've learned much about the formulation of fat, sugar, and salt in foods to create a bliss point (and if you have yet to read that book by Michael Moss, would highly recommend it). This is another book to help my brain cement why I want to get off the sugar ride. I found the history of sugar fascinating, and there is much research and studies covered here that should be talked about on the news daily. Our lack of health is a clear and present danger, and we only seem to be getting sicker, so where is the outrage? There is so much I learned here, like how tobacco soaked in sugar is the technology that made the industry take flight. Sugar is not your friend, and yet somehow we cannot celebrate or mourn or relax or take a breather without a hit. Learning more about the powerful forces behind this industry was eye opening. The reason I deducted a star was because the writing is rather stilted and a bit of slog to get through at times. Still, there are so many sections highlighted in my copy for review. If you've never read about this topic I'd suggest starting with the book mentioned earlier and then make your way here. As an aside, this sweet toothed sugar junkie is off the sugar ride, and it has been way easier than I would have ever believed possible.

In fairness. as the author points out, we don't get to conduct the experiment of eating a high sugar diet w/o the rest of the factors of modern western society. The book itself has quite a bit of discussion of the history of sugar, sugar lobby, FDA history etc but it isn't until about 2/3rds through the book that he presents evidence on health issues. Much of the book has info that anyone who has been reading in media has heard before. The author also doesn't address some controversial issues. For example he defines sugar broadly (including high fructose corn syrup). But he doesn't provide guidance on eating fruit. If sugar is as bad as he suggests then wouldn't it follow that we should also not eat very much fruit? This is largely not discussed.

I read Sugar Blues in the 70's and it was an attack on sugar; this is more an attack on an industry that knew the damage they were doing but there was too much money involved for them to stop.

But in your heart, you already know it\u2019s true. Sugar is killing us. Slowly. It takes years and even decades to see its full effect, and that\u2019s what makes it so insidious. After year of eating with apparent impunity, it ends in diabetes, heart disease, cancer, and Alzheimer\u2019s. Taubes, taking an epidemiological approach to the subject, subscribes to the theory of sugar as a hormonal regulatory disrupter that has a different metabolic effect than other substances. That is, a calorie of sugar is not equal to other calories - it changes the way the body stores fat and leads to insulin resistance, a precursor to the metabolic syndrome that\u2019s responsible for a whole host of chronic diseases. While most observers just fat-shame people for overindulging and taking in too many calories, lab studies with rats show that even when keeping calorie intake the same, the rats who had sugar still gained weight, vs those who did not. Taubes is particularly strong when he explores the role the sugar industry has played in skewing scientific research and public opinion to avoid blame for America\u2019s health catastrophe (to include speciously discrediting artificial sweeteners.) So why only 3 stars? For starters, the bookis incredibly tedious. But also, while I completely agree that sugar is a primary cause of poor health in America, I think it\u2019s too simplistic to boil it down to being the only cause. Nutrition is incredibly complex, and there are so many deficiencies in the diets produced by our highly processed, industrialized food system that other factors (such as saturated fat, refined flours, and sodium) cannot be completely ruled out as co-contributors."}, {"userName": "Elizabeth", "userReviewDate": "Nov 02, 2017", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/5-elizabeth", "userReview": "I listened to this on audiobook.

There are no diet plans, no recipes, nothing about losing weight. He isn't a doctor trying to get rich by selling a book based on the latest food craze. Taubes is a science writer, and he presents evidence to prove that sugar is the cause of every modern disease in the Western world. Sound like an exaggeration? It isn't. He makes a solid case.Unless you have gone deep into the research yourself, you probably believe what we've all been told: -Sugar is essentially harmless. Yes, you shouldn't eat a lot because it is \"empty calories\" and has no nutritional value. You don't want too many of your daily calories spent on food that doesn't have any essential vitamins and minerals. But in moderation, there's nothing wrong with the occasional sweet treat as long as the rest of your diet is \"healthy\". (wrong)-People who are obese eat too much and move too little. It's all about energy balance (calories in/calories out). (wrong)-Dietary fat causes chronic disease (obesity, heart disease, cancer); specifically butter, eggs, dairy, and fatty meats. You order your pancakes with a side of turkey bacon, thinking you're making a healthy choice. (wrong)This book is dense with facts, but it is a compelling read. Parts of it made me *so* angry. People, we have been lied to, and it's killing us. Taubes gives us the history of the sugar lobby (which Franklin Roosevelt called \"the most powerful pressure group that has descended on the national capital during our lifetime.\" In the '60s, the Silver Anvil Award went to the Madison Avenue firm the Sugar Association hired to wage a sugar-defense campaign. The award was for \"the forging of public opinion.\" The purpose of that campaign? To assure the public that sugar is safe. In 1964 a Scottish physician was quoted in The Lancet as saying: \"The refining of sugar may yet prove to have been a greater tragedy for civilized man than the discovery of tobacco.\") They used their influence to suppress scientific research and to sway politicians to affect public policy. The parallels to the tobacco industry are clear. It's infuriating when you read the studies and the history that Taubes presents in this book.But we expect industries to make money at the expense of the public. The part that was really infuriating was how the NIH has played a major role in this. They had studies dating from the '40-'60s that showed it was sugar, not dietary fat, that raises triglycerides. They had studies showing that too much sugar causes metabolic syndrome. But here's the pivotal moment that got us to where we are now: in the late 1960's, the NIH set out to confirm this hypothesis: \"a low-fat diet plus blood pressure medication will help people live longer.\" In 1982 they published the results, and THEY FAILED TO CONFIRM THE HYPOTHESIS. Men on low-fat diets suffered MORE deaths than men who ate more fat. They ran a second trial using cholesterol-lowering meds, and published the results in 1984. The results showed that the meds helped, but just barely. Based on that study alone, the NIH, concerned about deaths from heart disease, ASSUMED that if a cholesterol-lowering drug helped reduce deaths, it should be the recommendation for all people over the age of two to eat a low-fat diet. They undertook a massive public relations campaign to sell a low-fat, high-carb diet, and we've been living with the consequences ever since. The NIH did the study again, this time with women, starting in the early '90s. They published their results in 2006, and once again, they failed to confirm the hypothesis. MORE WOMEN DIED EATING A LOW-FAT DIET, one with whole grains and less red meat, than women who ate more fat. And yet the official recommendations haven't changed. You can thank the sugar lobby for that. They benefit from our collective ignorance.And can't we see that this is true? All we have to do is look around and see that we are getting more and more unhealthy. Think this sounds crazy? Try giving up all sugar for a week (read your labels, it's in everything) and see how you feel. That first week will be HARD, because you are addicted. It's as addicting as cocaine. As someone who has struggled with weight, this book confirmed what I know to be true from personal experience. It's not about eating less. Some people are genetically predisposed to being sensitive to sugar. If you are, then you will have a hormonal, metabolic response to sugar that will only get worse over time. Your body will secrete too much insulin, which will then cause you to store those calories as fat. That body fat then secretes its own hormones, putting you into a state called Metabolic Syndrome. No amount of calorie reduction will lead to permanent weight loss. Eventually your body will become insulin-resistant. This is why you can eat a low-fat diet of only 1200 calories and exercise everyday, and still remain overweight! If you restrict calories you may lose weight at first, but you will gain it all back (just google \"The Biggest Loser contestants\" and read about how they've all ended up heavier than when they started.)Taubes also gives evidence that sugar is at the root of cancer and dementia. He has less evidence to present here (compared to the overwhelming evidence tying sugar to heart disease and diabetes), but he does have peer-reviewed, scientific studies to back up these claims. The research here is new and still emerging, but the correlation is undeniable (i.e. cancer and dementia are nearly nonexistent in cultures that don't eat a Western diet, but then appear within one-to-two generations when a culture adopts a Western diet). I know this is a bummer. We love our sweets. We can't imagine celebrating a birthday without a cake, or Christmas without a gajillion treats. We associate love and comfort with our favorite foods, with Grandma's cookies. I'm the same way. We think that this is how we've always done things, but as you'll read in this book, refined sugar hasn't been around that long. Maybe if we can wean ourselves off sugar, we could get to a place where we truly only eat it a few times a year. (Could a former smoker have a cigarette only two or three times a year...? Is that even possible?)

It is eye-opening though just to come to terms with how sugar has affected me in so many different ways at pivotal moments in my life. Unfortunately it also brings to bear the same old story that underlines every industry's political past in the United States: conflict of interest. I'm starting to feel like I can't trust anything in this country as it has undoubtedly been so manipulated by duplicitous science, political manipulation, and downright lies, that there is no telling which way is what.That being said, Taubes is definitely totally against sugar, and proposes we eliminate it entirely from our diets, much as someone trying to quit smoking would have to eliminate the habit entirely instead of cutting down.

And did you know that cigarette smoking became popular and created the lung-smoking epidemic AFTER sugar-curing became popular? Soaking the tobacco leaves in sugar water before they were cured made the cigarettes taste better and made them more addictive. There's been a lot of news lately about how the sugar companies worked to keep nutritionists focused on fat being to blame for the rise in obesity and diabetes rates rather than sugar. Now we know that sugar consumption plays a major role in both. And it's harder and harder to avoid not only sugar, but all the multiple sugar substitutes, too, because it's in everything.
