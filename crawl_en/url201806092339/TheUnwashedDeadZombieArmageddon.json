The dead suddenly are not quite as dead as they should be......A mysterious government body has decided to use the estate as an experiment. Things are out of control & now they need to eradicate all knowledge & existence of the estate.But what happens when a small group of survivors band together? Will they survive the apocalypse & triumph over the undead? My Thoughts: Zombies are really not my thing, but I have heard good things about Ian Woodhead\u2019s fiction, so agreed to read the first two books in his Zombie Armageddon series, The Unwashed Dead and Walking with Zombies. The third book is Infected Bodies. All books are available in the normal places you get ebooks.This was a fast-paced, exciting book. It consisted mostly of little character vignettes, showing what people were doing when they started to turn into zombies, how those who didn\u2019t turn reacted, and how people went about trying to survive. Add in secret government experiments and mysterious soldiers, and you have a story that is hard to put down. Good stuff for the horror and zombie fan."}, {"userName": "Megan", "userReviewDate": "Apr 16, 2011", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/1233686-megan", "userReview": "Fantastic zombie gore! The Unwashed Dead isn't written well enough to be scary. But there is so much zombie madness, and so many people succumb to the hoard, it was still an enjoyable read. As far as the writing goes, this can use quite a bit of polishing. So many characters are introduced that it was difficult for me to keep them all straight and remember all of them. On one hand, author Ian Woodhead would introduce a new character only to have said person become zombie food. Great and unexpected! On the other hand, knowing that each character had only a very slim chance for survival made me not invest much interest in them. Writing wise, this is at best a two star book. But the zombie bits are so bloody good, I am bumping it up to three! This is one I only recommend to hard core zombie fans."}, {"userName": "Abbie", "userReviewDate": "Oct 27, 2016", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/10194401-abbie", "userReview": "An okay read, but I'm not sure if I want to continue the series."}, {"userName": "chucklesthescot", "userReviewDate": "Sep 15, 2015", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/3426724-chucklesthescot", "userReview": "This book is an example of an author who doesn't take the time to think up interesting dialogue and descriptions. Instead he chooses to have totally pointless swearing in every sentence of the book. This is what we get in the space of the first 1.5 pages of the ebook:-shitty kitchen and effing lino on the floor-his hosts, who are b******s, not giving two s***s about decorating-refers to himself as a miserable b*****d (correct!)-his friend's are all effing retards -the music gets on his t**s and is a pile of s***eSwearing in books is ok with me if there is a purpose ie when someone is angry or scared of being chased by fast zombies. But I do not find it entertaining to be bombarded by f bombs and stuff because of lazy writing and no imagination. People might say 'yeah but it's realistic because people talk and think like that'. True but if I want to hear that language all day, I'll go and sit in the city centre and hear it for free. When I read a book, I want to get away from everyday life and be entertained, not feel like it's a Friday night when the pubs have closed.This was not clever writing or witty dialogue. This was just rubbish and I'm so glad I got this free. If I had paid for it, I would've been really angry.

The book follows several different groups of people as they try to survive, from teens pleased they are staring in their favourite video games, to others who want to hide.

I have to note that as an American, my interpretation of the term \"estate\" is something along the lines of a village, or at least a close facsimile. Several residents complain of severe migraines one night, and not long after, they transform into flesh eaters, tearing apart everyone around them. As their neighbors are devoured and others are left trying to grasp what's happening, the army, or some mysterious government agency, moves in to clean up the mess they apparently created, which translates into making sure no one is left around to tell the tale. The story moves at a rapid pace, with plenty of guts and gore carrying the story forward as many of the characters are slaughtered until only a handful remain. The Unwashed Dead was a quick, simple zombie read. It doesn't bring anything new to the table as far as the undead are concerned-they are traditional Romero shamblers, but for me, there is nothing wrong with that. Perhaps the breakneck pace made it hard for me to grow attached or intrigued by any of the characters, but it was clear that the author plans on a sequel due to the sudden and abrupt ending to the book. The story was a fun bloodbath with plenty of zombie action and gore. It could have perhaps done with another editing run by the author. There are a few instances of misplaced identity, in particular early on in the story-by which I mean that I thought one character was doing or saying something because of pronoun usage, but it was actually another character and I had to reread a few passages here and there. There were some other typos, though my philosophy on that is that I can tolerate them as long as I get the gist of what the author is saying, which I did, but it deserves to be mentioned here as a fair and honest critique. Despite those quibbles, I did enjoy this story for what it was-a fast paced, gory tale of a traditional zombie uprising. It will be interesting to see where the author takes the story with his sequel."}, {"userName": "Denna", "userReviewDate": "Aug 28, 2011", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/948231-denna", "userReview": "This was a great Zombie story. Sometimes I crave a little light gore for reading material and this fit the bill perfectly. You\u2019re not going to find deep characters or a plot that keeps you guessing right up until the end, but you will find a fast pace with plenty of action and violence. The characters weren\u2019t particularly developed out, but they were still fun to read about. It was difficult at times to know who the bad guys were, the zombies or the characters trying to stay one step ahead of them. If I have a real complaint, it\u2019s that the editing was poor. There are lots of typos, punctuation and grammar problems, which tend to drive me absolutely crazy. In this case, I was looking for a no-brainer, fun read for in between those that are heavy going and this was a perfect choice. Without the editing issues I would have scored this a four and possibly even a five.

YES it has some typos and yes it could possibly have been tweaked a little here and there to make it a tad more polished.... BUT this is soon to be a thing of that past as of 10/12/2013 Ian Woodhead has a wonderful new editor and it should soon shine like it supposed to!IW has some great, fresh ideas that he brings to the zombie story genre.Wham! What a great way to start a horror book with some poor bloke, who I secretly hated (!), getting his manly bits bitten off!If you are squeamish or scared of swearing then this author and series of books is NOT for you! Set \"up North\" in the UK, it's rough and tough stuff, and I'm pleased to note that he does not dumb his dialogue down for others to understand; if you don't get a certain phrase, look it up, haha and eeew will spring to mind often!Personally I thought the death and reanimation timings were a little too fast.Amongst the general goings on of a zompoc are these weird, not so wonderful, characters - such as Dennis who goes on a full serial killer jaunt whilst loving the impending apocalypse.A few sporadic little personal stories that usually don't end well gave me a sense of fullness to the whole story, such as poor Jacob, to be finally socially acceptable only to succumb to parental control. IW is a master at creating some really detestable characters and his gore descriptions are enough to make you wince. In his world nobody is perfect and we all have a little edge to us, especially if the zombies start to invade (although I would like to point out I have never buried anyone locally!)As the remaining survivors meet up the tensions are high and IW leaves this book on a real cliffhanger.What is following them? Will Dennis survive his encounter? Is his theory correct?I really enjoyed the British element such as the snooker cues must be used against zombies instead of just an endless supply of bullets (the world is ended where are they all coming from?)This book romped, or should that be groaningly shuffled, along with good pace, I am so looking forward to rest in this series."}, {"userName": "Kat", "userReviewDate": "Nov 27, 2011", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/3835702-kat", "userReview": "Full review on my blog: http://theaussiezombie.blogspot.comYay the zombies are back in town and in full force too! The Unwashed Dead has a great setting \u2013 a council estate in northern England with the full range of characters that you would expect \u2013 the slightly geeky kid, the ex-con turned good (kinda), a whole bunch of chav\u2019s and some familiar scenes in the graveyard, the pub and the corner shop run by Mr. Singh which sells anything and everything. There are is also one unexpected and surprising character, but I\u2019m not going to give you any more info than that!The Unwashed Dead does contain a whole gamut of characters which are thrown at the reader in pretty quick succession \u2013 I didn\u2019t have a lot of trouble remembering who was who, but I can see how it could be a little overwhelming for a reader who likes a lot of character development before a new character comes along, but the story wouldn\u2019t work as well without the quick changes. It\u2019s important to remember this is a hard-core zombie story so a lot of the characters do die, negating the need for in-depth character development.The conspiracy theory surrounding the sudden zombification of the residents of the estate is presented as a teaser \u2013 it\u2019s obvious the story will be continued in the next book, but sets the groundwork out well.This is a gory book (as I like my Zombie books to be), and a lot of action scenes (again, how it should be). The regional accent/way of speaking could be a little difficult to understand if you aren\u2019t used to it, but rings very true to life.There is a lot of strong language in The Unwashed Dead, but it is necessary as it is a realistic reflection of how the characters would speak. There are also some small spelling and grammatical errors, but far less than I\u2019ve encountered in other self-published books.If you like your characters tough and real, enjoy zombie books where death is possible at any time and the gore and action are heavy, I can definitely recommend this book to you!"}, {"userName": "Joline Novy", "userReviewDate": "Apr 26, 2013", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/16944122-joline-novy", "userReview": "I actually finished this book quite a few days ago but because of different circumstances and commitments, I was only just today able to get my review done. Anyway, onto my review.....I'm a big fan of Ian Woodhead. He has a very unique writing style and, being from \"across the pond\" uses many terms and vocabulary I'm not always familiar with. For the most part, I can figure out the meanings just from the context of the sentence. The ones I'm not sure about are very easy to look up. I actually really enjoy that part of reading his books. I'm a lover of words, especially new ones. It's always fun for me to be able to research some of the words and phrases Ian uses. But, enough about the grammar, let's talk about, The Unwashed Dead.This book, right from page one, is very unique. It jumps right into people becoming zombies and without a whole lot of explanation. I won't give away any spoilers, but I will say.....every time I get a headache, I'll think of this story. Ian does a fantastic job of jumping back and forth between the different characters and their stories. Everything flows perfectly from one point of view to the next leading up to the different characters coming together towards the end. I also enjoyed the \"realistic\" scenarios that these characters are thrown into. Most zpoc books portray people that are \"preppers\" or \"survivalists\" or \"gun experts\". The Unwashed Dead actually takes a totally different route. These characters are \"real\" people who are frightened and use whatever weapons are at their disposal. Some grab baseball bats, hammers, pool cues, beer bottles......pretty much anything they can get their hands on to try to survive.I won't give away any spoilers from this book.....That's just not my style. You'll have to download this great book and see for yourself just what a great story it is!!Thanks for writing such a fast-paced, action-packed, \"believable\" zpoc book, Ian!! I was very entertained by it and cannot wait for the next installment!! Well done!! :-)"}, {"userName": "Books", "userReviewDate": "Jan 25, 2013", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/6665735-books", "userReview": "I\u2019m not in the habit of reading blurbs on book covers, but with this book I wish I did. Had I done so, the poorly written overview would\u2019ve given me a good indication of what to expect regarding grammar and format. I\u2019m a huge fan of zombie-themed books, so the minute I saw the words \u201cZombie\u201d and \u201cArmageddon\u201d in the title, I didn\u2019t think twice to download it to my kindle when it was free on Amazon. The writing is not too bad, if you turn a blind eye to the astounding amounts of profanity, of which there\u2019s so much it would make a sailor blush. I might\u2019ve actually enjoyed the story had I not been so distracted by the poor editing \u2013 or lack thereof. Really, it hurt my eyes. Don\u2019t expect much in the way of character development or world-building either. Hardcore horror fan that I am, I did enjoy the blood, guts, and chaos, but that\u2019s all there is to this book \u2013 straight-out zombie bashing, with no plot twists, at its finest. If you\u2019re new to zombie-themed books, I suggest you check out \u201cHollowland\u201d (always free on kindle) by Amanda Hocking and/or \u201cSolstice\u201d by Donna Burgess. Those are two of the best zombie apocalypse books I\u2019ve read and their excellent five-star ratings can testify to this. Before this turns into a rant about authors not taking pride in their work though, let\u2019s move on. I think the author had a good idea for this story, but he didn\u2019t pen it well. Also, a professional editor can make a world of difference to this book. Despite the terrible editing, poor grammar, incorrect punctuation, and most of the characters using the f-bomb and other such nasty words in most of their dialogue, and elsewhere, the story itself was sort of okay. It\u2019s a quick read and I finished the book in less than a day. I recommend it to absolute die-hard zombie fans only, but rather wait until it\u2019s free for download again sometime.

Somehow he manages to make a completely unlikable character interesting, which is a challenge! It\u2019s nice to snigger over certain phrases which can be considered crude but are very British, our friends across the pond may not understand a lot of this book!Unfortunately, there are so many zombie books and films that it is quite an over saturated genre. For me this made it somewhat difficult to stay interested, not because of Ian\u2019s writing but because it\u2019s very difficult to find things in the zombie genre which have not been done already.Other than that this is a good story and it\u2019s loaded with quick lines to make you smile, along with good descriptive narration and a reference to a certain zombie movie which I\u2019m sure anybody reading this genre will pick up on.The only thing for me is that I didn\u2019t feel the danger, I wasn\u2019t particularly heart-broken when characters were killed and it didn\u2019t feel threatening when they were put in to situations. That is probably just me though and I will say that each situation described was interesting.At the end of the book Ian has very kindly put in a note to say thank you for reading and if possible please leave a review, and he\u2019s also provided the first two chapters of the next book; Walking with Zombies. Even with my comments above about not feeling the threat when reading this, the second book has hooked me in!"}, {"userName": "Mark", "userReviewDate": "May 22, 2011", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/5108317-mark", "userReview": "Now that the eerie air of familiarity I felt when reading Ian Woodhead\u2019s The Unwashed Dead has seen the setting confirmed as Bradford, it\u2019s tempting to say \u2018welcome to my old home town\u2019.Certainly, the revelation added a little frisson of nostalgia to the enjoyment as I found myself caught in the fray of this gripping frenzy of the undead, though a certain latent civic attachment compels me to point out that the real Bradford isn\u2019t infested with zombie hordes \u2013 well, not until the pubs and clubs shut their doors, but that\u2019s another story.Back to the main event and The Unwashed Dead is an action-packed ride into zombie mayhem, featuring plenty of gore \u2013 without ever going over the top \u2013 and the pacing is spot on. The characters are fully fleshed, ready for the zombies to take a bite, and one way or another you will care about their fate. There are no cardboard cut-outs, stereotypes or caricatures to be found among the cast of this novel. The Unwashed Dead is a cracking piece of work that fully deserves to find a place on the shelves of any bookstore.

Everything seemed to tumble right along, and I found myself looking at each chapter as if it were a short story. The gore and creativity of killing the undead was good.The down side for me and my personal tastes: I couldn\u2019t get a feel for any of the characters. There was a lack of a physical description for all of the characters, and it kept me from creating the image in my mind that would have me latching on to them. There were quite a few punctuation typos also that bothered me; I wasn't sure if it was just the download that I got or not. It made it difficult to read with missing quotations around dialect. I think people who enjoy playing video games that pertain to killing zombies would enjoy this.

They were so real that by the end I felt like yelling at the characters to wise up. There were no ideal people in this book. For the most part there were simply people I know and am. There were some crazies, what kind of zombie book lacks those who lose it? But in an admirably inexplicable way, all of the characters were joe shmoez.

This was my 1st zombie book I ever read, I'm hoping the others I read are a lot better."}, {"userName": "Mark", "userReviewDate": "Feb 17, 2014", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/15122200-mark", "userReview": "I bought this hoping for another Apocalypse Cow, but was slightly disappointed. The writer captures the language well, but tends to drag things out like James Herbert, with chapters dedicated to one character that will be zombie food by the end of the chapter, but does include a few things that make sense further on in the story."}], "description": "In a rundown council estate in the North of England strange things are happening.
