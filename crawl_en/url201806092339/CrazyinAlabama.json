Serious conversations and events surrounding civil rights infractions are juxtaposed against bubbly, absurd, but dark comedy. He did the same type of thing in One Mississippi to similarly great effect. Both of these books are on my Favorites shelf.One of the little parallels I appreciated was that the pool scene in Alabama - where people of color are not welcome - has a contrast with another poolside vignette that takes place in mid-century Beverly Hills. The scenes are not simultaneous on his timeline - that would be too blatant a device for Childress - but I noted them. For a writer who can make his readers actually guffaw out loud, this guy is subtle enough that you may not even see it.Some aspects of his comedic relief here are not altogether believable, but that comes from me who is one of the rare readers that dislikes most magical realism. Basically, I have the imagination of an aircraft carrier - it's gray and sturdy.Childress' writing, however, lets me enjoy the frothiness. When reading about dark aspects of history, even when contained in \"just\" a fictional story, a little dose of laughter is like a spoonful of sherbet. Cleanses the palate and allows you to appreciate the rich taste of the main course.This will make you squirm and smile, both."}, {"userName": "Diane Barnes", "userReviewDate": "Feb 06, 2017", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/7262060-diane-barnes", "userReview": "This is my second reading of this book, the first being many years ago. Of course, I remembered the Tupperware container, and I remembered the swimming pool integration and all it entailed, but for the life of me, I could not remember the ending. I was a little disappointed in the Judge at Lucille's trial, but all in all, pretty satisfying.Long story short, Lucille feeds her husband rat poison, cuts off his head, puts it in a green Tupperware Lettuce Keeper (you know, the one with the burp and seal top.). She drops her six kids at her mother's and takes off for Hollywood to get a role on \"The Beverly Hillbillies\" . That's where the outrageous humor in this book begins.Her story is juxtaposed against that of her nephew, twelve year old Peejoe, who witnesses first hand the awful hypocrisy and cruelty of 1965 Alabama and the Civil Rights movement that changes his perception of right and wrong. This is a fast paced novel that will have you laughing and crying in equal measure. I enjoyed every word. But I do wonder if the Tupperware Company had anything to say about how well it's freshness seal actually worked."}, {"userName": "Camie", "userReviewDate": "Feb 03, 2017", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/7399266-camie", "userReview": "Mark Childress , an author I've not read before , can write a pretty darn entertaining book !

And it is hilariously funny in spots. It reminds me of a cutting and yet spot on era work of Stephen King. It's not horror, but yet it is. The first half I enjoyed far more than the second. And not because of the tension within the horrific events in town over the swimming pool integration, nor even with the macabre details of the Tupperware container's innards or the escapades they traveled. It was something else that made me completely uneasy. Whatever that something is (for a feeling descriptive word)- it is nearly identical to what I felt when I read Stephen King's IT. It was way too over the top nasty in base imagination for me. Funny to a point, and then all of a sudden, not at all funny. Not at all funny enough to give me a stomachache. Most of these characters are extremely well drawn. As is the town and the funeral home arrangements for precision detailing. Poor Mabel! Both Dove and Chester, completely of that time. As were the kids all around. Some of their amusements and habits absolutely authentic. You did not need to be in Alabama to harness bugs. It wasn't my habit, but my brother did it all the time. I recall having a son with an attached caterpillar \"train\" once, too. Boys.But most of Lucille's story that occurred on the road after New Mexico? That \"men met and used\" made me queasy, rather than made me laugh. And the ending for her was not what I expected. For me it lost at least 1/2 a star. Meemaw's and Peejoe's stories were the best parts of the book. At least a 4 star. But the shootings, the fire, the riot, and Milton! All of that, it brought back very bad memories. Riots are not funny. When an author makes them funny, something in me just cringes. I've been there with Peter, and it sure isn't a laugh. That someone CAN laugh about the entire in such a way, so much later? If you are in a safe place where difference doesn't often entail some form of baiting or violence encouraged, I guess it's altered? And that kind of \"make believe\" can seem far more funny to read about. Particularly shooting through walls or kicking people when they are down."}, {"userName": "Snotchocheez", "userReviewDate": "Jul 13, 2011", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/1899836-snotchocheez", "userReview": "A flood of emotion overswept me after reading this rather strange novel. I immediately checked out Mark Childress on wikipedia to see where this guy presently lives For someone who was born and raised in Alabama (according to the book's profile blurb), Mr. Childress must certainly have hated living here, because with the exception of one of his protagonists, nearly all of the characters in \"Crazy In Alabama\" come off as either racist buffoons or homicidal maniacs (or, in a few instances, racist homicidal buffoons). Set in 1965 in Industry, AL (pronounced in-DUST-ree, thank you very much) it follows two plot threads in a headache-inducing fashion: Lucille, amother of six kids, kills her husband, then high-tails it to Hollywood to become an actress. At fhe same time she is on the lam, her nephews Peejoe (nyuk nyuk...crazy Alabamian shorthand for Phillip Joseph) and Wiley are shipped off to live with their funeral home director uncle, at the very same time a Selma-esque race war breaks out in Industry. Here's whence the headache ensues: half of the novel (the \"Auntie's Gone Crazy\" part) is a lighthearted romp (or at least farcical in the extreme), the other half depicts an extremely somber, totally serious civil rights struggle. The reader (certainly THIS reader, anyway) doesn't know whether to chuckle at Aunt Lucille's cornpone antics or be utterly appalled at rednecks beating up blacks wanting to swim in a community pool (with the seeming aegis and sanction of notorious former Alabama governor George Wallace). This overall story is an implausible mess, chockablock with puerile dialog and perpetuated stereotypes; its 2-star rating is only merited by the overall strength of the story, which is (after shaking off the headache) is compulsively readable, if only in a train-wreck sorta way. (A parenthetical aside to Mr. Childress, who evidently no longer lives in Alabama: Did you hate Alabama THAT bad that you had to make it seem like everyone there is a big ol' dummy?? While the civil rights movement brought the attention of the whole world to Alabama in the '60s, it's a stigma that the state has tried hard to overcome...and...I got news for you...racism exists today in the 21st century...even in Florida, where you live. Ever look at the racial demographics for states like Montana? North/South Dakota? Idaho?There's a reason black folks don't live there...yet no one's writing books (or screenplays for really bad movies) like \"Crazy In South Dakota\". Racism is not unique to Alabama...turning your recollections of life in Alabama into a circus freakshow does everyone in Alabama a disservice.)"}, {"userName": "Renee King - Hooks", "userReviewDate": "Mar 12, 2012", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/7971473-renee-king---hooks", "userReview": "As one born and raised in Alabama I can relate to much of this hilarious story of one crazy Bama Belle.

Everything is going smoothly until Lucille, their aunt pays a visit with her six kids and informs them that she's killed her husband, Chester. They don't believe her until she pulls his head out of a Tupperware container. She takes off for Hollywood, leaving her six kids with her mother and has an adventure from Alabama through Louisiana on her way to California. She steals a car, leaves a highway patrolman locked up in the backseat of his cruiser, hits for $32,000 at the roulette table in Vegas before landing a role on The Beverly Hillbillies. If she had gotten rid of Chester's head she would have never gotten caught.Meanwhile Wiley and Peejo have to live with their uncle Dove in Industry, AL because Meemaw can't take care of 8 kids by herself. While living in industry, they witness the death of Taylor Jackson, an African American, by the hands of the police; the city is in an uproar and a race war is going to come to a showdown in Industry. In a short period of time they both grow up to understand that there is no difference between the whites and blacks except the color of their skin.A book that describes a story about racial unrest, an unhappy wife and justice for everyone regardless of their color. It's written well using Peejo and Lucille as the narrators of the story.

While this is the best Childress novel I\u2019ve read thus far, I still would recommend starting with V for Victor, which builds more evenly and conveys an almost nostalgic mood, despite its subject matter of World War II and Nazi infiltration. But. Crazy is grand Childress. At first, I thought the two storylines in this novel entirely too disparate to work : a mostly comic tale of a thirty-something woman who murders her husband and trots off to Hollywood\u2014with his decapitated head!\u2014to cameo in a TV sitcom counterpointed by the first-person narration of a young white boy violently thrown into the Civil Rights movement of the mid-sixties. After my second reading, though, the light hit: Of course, just as women were kept voiceless by males, blacks were kept so by whites. The fantastical ribaldry of a youngish mother silencing her husband\u2019s will by poisoning him then cutting off his head gets countered by the grisly realism of blacks being silenced and murdered by whites for daring to want to swim in a public pool. Lucille, the mother, laments of her deceased husband, \u201cChester had been killing me the slow way for thirteen years. You spend all day cooking a meal for a man and he gobbles it down in five minutes, and never says thank you, and a little piece of you dies.\u201d In the same vein, Peejoe, the young white narrator, reports this on his way sneaking to hear Martin Luther King speak in his hometown: \u201cAn old colored man was down on his knees, edging a sidewalk with a hatchet. He nodded hello as we passed. A voice echoed down the street.\u201d The echoing voice is none other than the Reverend King preaching freedom through a P.A. system. \u201cThe old man cocked his ear to listen.\u201d So, just as Lucille wakes up, the blacks in the small Alabama town of Industry wake up, Peejoe and his brother and his uncle wake up. But it takes a goodly share of blood for this to happen; it takes everyone in Alabama going crazy. This novel offers a masterful blend of tragedy and comedy, and the light-hearted ending comes as a welcoming relief after the sorrows of the Civil Rights movement in the imaginary town of Industry, Alabama. Were that the events were imagined! Nicely peopled with interesting subplots and characters, by the way. A fine read."}, {"userName": "Shannon", "userReviewDate": "Feb 05, 2008", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/216164-shannon", "userReview": "What a disappointment after reading One Mississippi, which I thought was a great book. This one has the same over the top quality, but the storyline isn't as good and the sexual content is just gratuitous. I can handle some racy scenes in a book if they are central to the plot, but I felt this was just for the sake of sensationalism. While the author tries to address a serious theme, he is only somewhat successful in that. A real disappointment."}, {"userName": "Christa", "userReviewDate": "Dec 16, 2008", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/261662-christa", "userReview": "Crazy in Alabama kept me interested, but after finishing it, I can't really say that I liked the book. Some of the characters were not at all sympathetic, and the events in the book were sometimes too over the top for me. There was more than one story taking place during the book, and I liked some of them less than others. This book tell the story of Lucille, a beautiful small-town mother of six who dreams of making it in Hollywood. Lucille's husband does not share her dreams for herself, and he belittles the yearnings of her heart. Deciding she has had enough of him, Lucille poisons her husband, cuts off his head with a kitchen knife, then delivers her children to her mother before taking off for Hollywood. Lucille has sexual encounters with several men as she travels across the country with her dead husband's head in tow. Lucille lands a guest spot on The Beverly Hillbillies before her past catches up with her.Lucille's two orphaned nephews have lived with her mother since their parents' deaths. Much of the book is told from the viewpoint of PeeJoe, the youngest of the two boys. When Lucille drops her children off with her mother, the elderly woman cannot continue to care for her two orphaned grandsons while trying to deal with the trauma Lucille's six children are enduring. An uncle who is an undertaker picks up the boys and takes them to live with him temporarily. PeeJoe misses his loving grandmother terribly, and while his uncle is kind to him, his aunt by marriage is not. PeeJoe enjoys the exposure that living above a funeral parlor has to the undertaking business. Twelve year old PeeJoe dreams of being an undertaker himself when he grows up. As tensions mount in the community, PeeJoe has to make some tough choices about whether to stand up for his beliefs. The small Alabama community where PeeJoe stays with his uncle becomes involved in racial turmoil over segregational issues. Violence comes into play and escalates until some innocent lives are taken. As PeeJoe, his brother, and his uncle make choices about what stand to take, they risk danger and violence themselves. The events of the summer change the lives of PeeJoe and his family members.I enjoyed reading about PeeJoe and the challenges he faced, but I did not care much for the parts of the book that were about Lucille. The book alternated between what was going on with PeeJoe in Alabama and Lucille on her journey to California. I found the chapters that were about PeeJoe to be much more interesting and enjoyable than the ones about Lucille."}, {"userName": "Judi", "userReviewDate": "Feb 14, 2017", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/1024987-judi", "userReview": "I must say that this book certainly whetted my appetite for my good old \"Memaw's\" Southern Cooking. It also engaged my darkish wit, brought back painful memories of racism that churned in the mid 60's. Everywhere. (It seems to be bubbling back up in current times.)

It takes a writer with talent and a deft touch! Orphaned Peejoe is living with his loving Meemaw when his Aunt Lucille decides to murder her husband and head to LA to audition for the Beverley Hillbillies. Sent to stay with his Uncle Dove, a funeral home owner and the County coroner, Peejoe finds himself in the middle of the Civil Rights movement when the town's Black residents try to desegregate the new swimming pool. Alternating chapters present PeeJoe's point of view as well as Aunt Lucille's. Lucille is a hoot, Peejoe is just trying to figure out what is going on and how he feels about it all. While the chapters describing the horrible acts of racism are disturbing (though historically accurate) it is how the people in Peejoe's life respond that provides insight and raise thought provoking questions.

I liked the cover and it sounded interesting; since then I've reread it multiple times and find that it grows with me. I've been wanting to check out one of his other books for a while but never sure what to commit to - similarly I happened on this at one of the last days of St. Marks Books. This book is a wild and tense ride of emotions and scenes. Less humor than One Mississippi and the influence of the characters is further reaching. 'Crazy in Alabama' is a painful look at 1965 Alabama during some of the worst moments in it's history. Childress writes as if the fictional town of Industry and the events therein are as real as Selma and Birmingham and with the lesser known horrors that occurred all over the south at the time, who's to say they're not? The book isn't perfect and there are plenty of characters so interesting, heartbreaking, or under-explored that you're certainly left wanting more.

Meanwhile, the protagonist's aunt has escaped an unhappy, psychologically abusive marriage by murdering and decapitating her husband.The aunt's murder of her husband is an interesting counterpoint to the casual brutality of the whites against the blacks.The most interesting thing in this book was not the white supremacists or the black civil rights workers, but rather the people in the middle. For instance, the elderly black funeral home worker, Milton, who felt he had all the freedom he needed, so why get involved in the civil rights struggle. And the protagonist's grandmother, a good woman who had grown up in the South yet believed her black neighbors were covered in germs.

This book is set in a small Alabama town in the early 60s. Like TKAM, we have two threads of the story that eventually meet up in the middle. Thread one? Young, beautiful wife with six kids and an abusive husband who poisons the husband with D-Con in his coffee and then decapitates him so that she can flee to Hollywoood where her deepest wish (to appear on the Beverly Hillbillies) can come true. Did I mention she carries the head with her? Its in a Tupperware salad crisper inside a beautiful hatbox. Because this is Southern Gothic, of course the head continues to speak to her.The other thread? The unspeakable civil rights violations. Awful, awful things happen and along the way both Martin Luther King and George Wallace visit the tiny town.It's an odd experience to read this book because the civil rights thread is painful and heartbreaking and Lucille's story is just silly.
