I really enjoyed the use of language and the point of view in this book. The characters,plotting and pacing are beautiful. I also appreciated the author's use of nuance and detail to bring the story to life. I was hooked from the moment that Casares mentioned that the main character,Don Fidencio,had a warped Narciso Martinez cassette in an old shoe box. That is precisely the kind of music enjoyed by my grandma's generation.  I was really taken with the character's names and I though that the author did an especially splendid job of capturing the rythym of old people's Spanish without writing in Spanish. This aspect of the book's style was especially fascinating to me.I have a tooth ache and a stomach ache,yet I was able to forget my woes by reading this book.

He rebels against the rules that only serve to take away his remaining freedom, and he despises the staff and his fellow residents, giving them nicknames such as The One With the Flat Face and The One Who Cries Like a Dying Calf.Soon after his internment he is visited by Don Celestino Rosales, his much younger widowed brother, and his even younger girlfriend Socorro, a divorced maid who cleans his house. The two men have been estranged from each other for years after a trivial argument, and Socorro has urged Don Celestino to visit Don Fidencio in the old age home. The two men reluctantly set aside their grudges, and the couple take Don Fidencio on a trip across the border to Linares, Mexico, in order to fulfill a promise he made to his grandfather many years ago.Amigoland is a well written and pleasant novel, but the story and its characters were only mildly interesting to me, which made for a good but not particularly memorable read."}, {"userName": "barbarafrank", "userReviewDate": "Jun 24, 2015", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/44246992-barbarafrank", "userReview": "This book lingered in my mind for years after first reading it.

They and their lives are beautifully depicted by this first time author. My family is from Texas and New Mexico so I felt I knew the setting there and in Mexico.

Even though they grew up in the same family, the distance in age between the two of them is great. Given the time between them, they grew up in two different cultures and have different values. They go on a quest to find where their father\u2019s family had once come.I found the book to be very funny at times especially the \u201cfights\u201d between the older brother and the nursing home staff \u2013 where he points out that he is 91 and won\u2019t live forever. The story had several poignant moments where the brothers bonded, as kids they were so far apart in age they never really bonded. It was also rich in descriptions of the situations they were in when they took their quest into Mexico.This book is not for everyone, but it should be.In a small town on the Mexican border live two brothers, Don Fidencio and Don Celestino. Stubborn and independent, they now must face the facts: they are old, and they have let a family argument stand between them for too long. Don Celestino's good-natured housekeeper encourages him to make amends--while he still can.

I wasn't the biggest fan of this book most of the way through. What had originally intrigued me from the blurb on the back doesn't really come into play until maybe the last 100 pages of the book (the book is about 400 pages, at least in my edition). The story was intriguing enough, but I found it to be slow paced - probably because I was waiting for something mentioned on the back, which is totally my fault! Looking back, the writing was great. The slowness suits the book and the descriptions and language was wonderful. For some reason, I seemed to rush myself through this book, but even still, I've really come to appreciate this story.

Casares has captured the sense of place in the border towns of Texas and Mexico perfectly. His characters, from the brothers we get to know well to the strangers in the Amigoland nursing home, are true and lifelike. He takes his time building the place and the people and the pacing feels as important to the story as the plot itself, giving the reader the sense of languishing among strangers for a while before the thrill of escape and adventure."}, {"userName": "Kookie", "userReviewDate": "Jun 19, 2017", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/1499425-kookie", "userReview": "Wonderful, high-spirited novel about an elderly dementia patient who manages to talk his brother into breaking him out of his nursing home for a trip over the border to clear up a family controversy.

It takes \"Amigoland\" perhaps half the novel to spring one of its protagonists, the 91-year old Fidencio, from the nursing home of the title. The man who springs him is his estranged much younger brother, Celestino, and together with Celestino's even younger Mexican lover, they travel to the rancho in Mexico from which their grandfather was kidnapped by Indians in a horrific raid. It is a pleasant enough trip, as Casares takes the time to observe this slice of northern Mexico closely, with its crammed bus terminals, testy immigration officers, and wandering taxi rides. And, of course, the rituals of courtesy in rural Mexico. Not all of it feels this authentic -- there is a painfully sentimental motif about the young chiclet sellers -- and the brothers' arguments can go on for a while. Atmosphere counts for a lot in this world. The ranch they find is outside Monterrey, in the citrus region of Linares, which is something I find personally difficult for reasons that having nothing to do with this book. At about the time it was published in 2009, Linares was being terrorized by a kidnapping ring allied with the Zeta cartel. On December 31 of last year, the ring's leader, a divorced mother in her early thirties, was publicly executed by a rival cartel on one of Monterrey's main arteries. This is of course just the most deliberately shocking incident in the daily news of gunfights, grenade-throwing, and murders that creeps out of Monterry. I travelled across Mexico for three years or so, and never felt less than safe, even at 5 a.m. in Mexico City, and it saddens me to have to wonder whether the Mexicans -- some of whom fed me when I hungry, took care of me when sick, and offered me shelter -- will ever be able to recover the kind of instinctive courtesy that Casares demonstrates in this novel."}, {"userName": "Glenn", "userReviewDate": "Oct 22, 2009", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/987678-glenn", "userReview": "3.5 stars for this debut novel by Oscar Casares. It tells the story of two estranged Mexican brothers named Don Fidencio and Don Celestino. Fidencio is a crusty, grumpy and stubborn old man confined to a nursing home called Amigoland, but still trying to hold onto his dignity and live life with humor. Celestino is a recent widower, worked as a barber all his life and has diabetes. He needs home help and hires a Mexican housekeeper named Socorro, who becomes his lover, even though she's 35 years younger than Celestino.It goes on to tell the story of how the brothers reunite and go on a journey back to Mexico, to the place where their grandfather lived, in El Rancho Capote.It has moments of humor, but is also a very touching story of family bonds, and maintaining dignity while going through medical issues that many people face as they age.It reminded me of my Dad, 83, who luckily for now is still able to live at home albeit w/nursing and home aide help. He's had a hip replacement, double knee replacements and has had Parkinson's for more than a decade. In 2002, he had to give up driving and the independence that goes along with that. He uses a walker everywhere he goes and uses a lift chair, which he also sleeps in, as it's too hard to get in and out of bed. He's fallen half a dozen times in the last 3 months, so I can see him failing more and more as time goes on. My Mom was his primary caregiver for a number of years, but is no longer able to do it because of her own health problems. It's difficult seeing your parents go through that, but I think it's better to try and stay in your own home as long as possible rather than be put in a nursing home."}, {"userName": "Katy Cesarotti", "userReviewDate": "Jul 31, 2014", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/25807970-katy-cesarotti", "userReview": "The true success of this work is the compassion and empathy with which the author draws his characters. Don Fidencio and his brother seemed so real, their fears and hopes tangible. Casares transports his readers through foreign worlds with ease and simplicity, and deals with fraught themes like aging, fear of meaninglessness, immigration and class divisions without seeming preachy or overbearing.\tAmigoland, however, lacked a sense of propulsion or tension. The action builds slowly, and the characters do not embark on their haphazard journey to Mexico until halfway through the novel. Although I was completely enamored with the relationship between the brothers and between Socorro and Celestino, I craved more action. The plot was so delicious when it happened\u2026I just wanted more to happen.\tThe relationship between Celestino and Socorro also could have been fleshed out more. I couldn\u2019t exactly figure out why the two were drawn to one another; all of their conversations seemed so relationship-centric, being together by talking about being together. Although Socorro fervently denies her family\u2019s claims that Celestino is using her, I couldn\u2019t divine the emotional core that attracted them to each other. The relationship seemed taken for granted, as fact, but I needed it to be proven to me."}, {"userName": "Jim", "userReviewDate": "Feb 19, 2010", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/439937-jim", "userReview": "The horrors of maintaining independence and dignity as you reach the twilight years are well examined in this story of a 91-yera-old Chicano man trapped in the \"prison\" of a retirement/old folk's home, hidden away by family and basically forgotten. Beset with many of the maladies experienced by much-older men, Don Fidencio Rosales dreams of returning to his native Mexico to resist the grounds and tales departed to him by his beloved grandfather. Only one surviving sibling, Celestino, a former barber twenty years his junior, having just lost his wife and entered a new relationship with a younger woman, reunited with his older brother for a little adventure. This first novel is pretty good, although at times it moved along about as well as an old timer on pushing his walker, and it lacked a bit of passion or mystery, but it was still decent, in a new MFA kind of way. The squabbling is delicious. The story does give nice insights into the long-standing relationship between neighboring countries, and some of what it is like to be caught between two worlds."}, {"userName": "May-Ling", "userReviewDate": "Apr 04, 2011", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/2911771-may-ling", "userReview": "how could i not pick up a book called amigoland? about halfway through the book, i found out the title is the name of a nursing home. this story is a bit about mexicans in america, somewhat about brotherhood and ambiguous relationships, and mostly about growing old.the story follows two brothers, almost 30 years apart, as they reconcile after many years and then embark on an adventure (would i call it that after reading along? maybe a small trip?) to mexico where their ancestors were from.i read casares' book brownsville, which i enjoyed for a collection of short stories. this book is quite good and i think i gave it 3 stars mostly because of the content. it's not a page turner, but like its subject, meanders around at an older pace. would you be flipping pages quickly to find out what happens next at the nursing home? probably not, but casares does an excellent job of capturing the humanity and embarrassment of growing older and the things we must deal with in our daily lives."}, {"userName": "Sue", "userReviewDate": "Mar 07, 2010", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/1203275-sue", "userReview": "This story was very reflective and understated. Fidencio's time in the nursing home is very dream-like, especially with his descriptions of the other inhabitants and workers-- The Turtles, The Gringo With The Ugly Finger, The One With The Big Ones. Don Celestino and Socorro's relationship is very sweet. Their journey to the ranchito in Mexico is full of old stories of their grandfather's time there, and it seems like they are going back in time when they go there. I loved reading this-- it was slow-paced but had enough humor and suspense to keep me turning the pages. It is very Texas, and I love that about it-- it also reminds me of Western authors like Wallace Stegner, Ivan Doig, and Willa Cather. I read it because I saw that it had been chosen for the mayor's book club in Austin, and it sounded interesting. The book club events so far have consisted of film screenings such as Cocoon, the Bucket List, and other movies about old people.

The betrayal of the body's beauty and function is relentless in this home where all levels of care are provided. Don Fidencio is trapped here because he fell asleep in the cold and pissed himself. A daughter and the \"son of a bitch\" (her husband) decide that he needs care somewhere else than their home. Thus Don is stuck in Amigoland and he is not taking it very well. He has descriptive and derogatory \"names\" for all the staff and fellow patients. They are worth the price of admission.The story unfolds slowly and with great consciousness as his brother, Don Celestino, and his brother's lover/housekeeper Socorro come to visit. The complicated dance between the older ex postal worker and the day worker from Mexico is starkly revealing about the perils and baggage that get in the way of starting over.

His estranged younger brother, Don Celestino, is coping with recent widowerhood, diabetes, and a new affair with his 35-year-old housekeeper, Socorro. The brothers can't remember why they don't speak. and at Socorro\u2019s urging, Celestino resumes contact with Fidencio, leading to an impulsive and completely unauthorized trip to Mexico to revisit the family\u2019s past and a heritage that more than 100 years earlier took them into the U.S. Casares provides an unflinchingly honest look at the indignities of old age and the fears and frustrations that come with losing control of your body.

Casares summons the substance of Texania well, capturing the corporate personalities of old Mexican-American men quite accurately. The work explores the questions of life, death, peace, fidelity and God in a way that is accessible and hilarious. The only reason I didn't give this 5 stars, is because there is a section or two where the sentimentality is too much and the feeling quickly goes from the easy flow of a pleasurable read presented by a writer confident of in his craft, to over-tried intellectual pap forced upon an audience by a writer who is trying to convince his audience that they should think him as great as he thinks he is.

Set in Brownsville, TX, the lives of these three characters become intertwined as the story explores the dynamics of life on the border, the antagonism within families, and inter-generational romantic differences.

This book captured the horrow of nursing homes in a funny way. Who would have thought this possible??? The author currently lives in Austin, TX and teaches at UT. I read an article of his in Texas Monthly and loved it so I decided to read his book. Quirky but realistic. I admire characters like this who fight the inevitable of failing memory and broken bodies. Those who find a way to live a full life despite society's desire to \"keep old people safe in nursing homes\". Fighting for a life outside medicine, pills, and nursing home food is how I want to go. Some people choose to enjoy life till the end. This may mean a shorter life but often the quality is better.

The nursing home scenes are spot on - even a casual visitor gets the sense of despair and lost hope projected by some - no, most of the residents of same. I really liked Fidencio. His younger brother Celestino is a much less rounded character and certainly not as likable. I found myself mentally urging Socorro to hit the road, so to speak. The transition to Mexico is unbelievable, even before 9/11, and the book just faded into the sunset. If there was a triumphant finish, it was Fidencio's decision to stay with his extended family in Mexico. I would not read it again.
