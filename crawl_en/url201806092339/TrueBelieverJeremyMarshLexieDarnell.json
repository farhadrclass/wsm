He is known for his scientific debunking abilities, such as outing a psychic as a fraud who claims to be able to speak to the dead. Jeremy lives in New York and is divorced. He was badly hurt in the process. It\u2019s been several years. He is very good looking and has no problem with women, just hasn\u2019t allowed himself to go beyond casual encounters. Jeremy received a letter in the mail from a woman named Doris from Boone Creek, North Carolina, inviting him to come to their tiny town to investigate some ghostly lights that appear in the town cemetery. He already has prime time television interested in him in the wake of his last story, so this one has the possibility of launching his career from journalism into television. He can\u2019t refuse. So off Jeremy goes, from the metropolitan city of New York, to a tiny town, dying little by little, grasping at straws to stay alive. Jeremy always solves his mysteries. Doris, the woman who wrote the letter, even claims to have some psychic abilities. But when Doris sends Jeremy to the town library to begin his research on the town\u2019s history, he meets Doris\u2019s granddaughter, the librarian, Lexie Darnell, and his life was forever changed.\n\u201cYou don\u2019t believe in magic of any kind?\u201d\u201cNo,\u201d he said.\u201cThat\u2019s sad,\u201d she said. \u201cBecause sometimes it\u2019s real.\u201d\nLexie loved living in Boone Creek. She loved being near her grandmother who raised her after her own parents tragically died. She loved her job as librarian. And she loved the people of the town. She did leave Boone Creek for college and even fell in love. But she was badly hurt and returned to Boone Creek, just as she always knew she someday would. She didn\u2019t want to feel an attraction to Jeremy. She had known men like him, big city men, who looked down on small towns like this one. And if she did allow herself to care, it would be she that would end up getting hurt. Because her life was here and his was in New York. Still, there was something about him, and it was too much to ignore.For Jeremy, Lexie was different than any other woman he had ever known. She challenged him in ways no one else ever had. Her humor was dry and sarcastic. She was intelligent and witty and sweet and honest to a fault. He had trouble keeping his mind on what he was supposed to be doing. His thoughts always seemed to drift to her. Could a man fall in love in just two days? Because he just can\u2019t imagine his life without her in it. Is there a way to make things work? Over his time in Boone Creek, Jeremy immersed himself in the town history and studied the cemetery and the surrounding areas. The mayor of the town treated Jeremy like a celebrity and Jeremy found himself impressed with the town and it\u2019s people. And finally, Jeremy got to see the lights. They were beautiful. It was an experience he\u2019ll never forget. Are they really the spirits of the long ago deceased or is there a logical explanation?This is a beautifully told love story between two people that were both okay being alone, who weren\u2019t looking for anything more than what they had. But isn\u2019t that when love usually finds you? When you aren\u2019t looking for it? This is actually a pretty long book. And I have to admit it was a little slow at times. In true Nicholas Sparks fashion, he builds the story slowly, allowing us to get to know the characters. I also admit that Lexie frustrated me a bit. But it was only because she was trying to protect herself, and her town. I loved Jeremy. For a man who spent his life proving that magic wasn\u2019t real, I loved how easily he accepted how he felt, what he saw in Lexie. There is a sequel to this book. It is a continuation of Lexie and Jeremy\u2019s story. But there is no cliff hanger with this one. It comes to a conclusion and you aren\u2019t left hanging in any way."}, {"userName": "Maria Clara", "userReviewDate": "Dec 08, 2016", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/46308842-maria-clara", "userReview": "Dicen que normalmente se conoce a los escritores por una obra: que una \u00fanica novela es lo que les da la fama.

I know it's supposed to be a romantic book but the so-called \"tension\" did not come across well in the book. It just felt like two people being stupid. Even the actual romantic parts was just two people being stupid. I read it very quickly, and not because I couldn't put it down, but because it was SO fluffy that there was nothing really to read.

I just finished it a couple hours ago and it was so good. I sort of predicted that two of the main characters who started out as complete strangers would end up falling in love. The basic storyline is about a man in his 30's named Jeremy Marsh who goes to Boone Creek, North Carolina to solve a mystery. People have reported seeing strange 'lights' in the town cemetery that have been unexplained. Doris, one of the residents of the town, sends a letter to Jeremy asking him to come to their town to try and figure out where they were coming from. As an investigative journalist, it was his job to expose frauds, solve mysteries, and write about them afterwards. Having been married and divorced before, Jeremy had no intention of looking for love on his trip from New York to North Carolina. He meets many of the townspeople, mostly people who work at the restaurants, gas stations, and most importantly, the town library. Jeremy spends a lot of time with the librarian, asking her for help and where he might find useful books or diaries that would help him with his research. He and the librarian become friends and begin spending a lot of time together, while jealous Rodney, a police officer, watches with a close eye, curious whenever the two go off somewhere together or show up together at a town event. Although Lexie, the librarian, and Rodney never really had a steady relationship, he asked her several times to go to dinner and things like that and she always said yes. But, ever since Jeremy came into town, he's been taking up most of her time. He learns a lot about her past, her parents, how they died, her grandparents, and a little bit about where she grew up and her childhood. When things started getting too serious for Lexie, who had been hurt more than once by men passing through, she ran away to a cottage she talked to Jeremy about, leaving only a vague note for him to read at the library. Fortunately for him, Jeremy remembered almost everything Lexie had told him, and it didn't take him long to figure out where Lexie had gone to. In the end, they fall in love, but Jeremy still has to go back to New York. With a sad good-bye and little thoughts besides Lexie running through his mind on the way home, Jeremy was only in his apartment for a few days before Lexie's grandmother, Doris, surprised him and showed up at his door. She told him that Lexie had lied about going to marry Rodney so that she wouldn't lie awake at night wondering why Jeremy never came back for her. Jeremy decided that he loved her and that he simply could not imagine a life without her, so he took a plane to North Carolina to be with Lexie. Doris was on the same plane with him and he left the terminal with her, driving Doris home in her car and then borrowing it to search the town for Lexie. After looking everywhere, he realized where she was. Jeremy was right, and he found her at her parents' grave in the Boone Creek Cemetery. Jeremy ended up buying a house there, one that Lexie helped him pick out. The book ends with a little miracle, one in which Jeremy was told and convinced would never happen due to biological reasons. And you'll have to read the book to figure out what happens. =]"}, {"userName": "Shaun", "userReviewDate": "Feb 20, 2015", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/9779623-shaun", "userReview": "Picked this up at a consignment shop. I was familiar with some of Sparks' other books which have been adapted into films, but had never read anything by him.This was okay. Sparks has a talent for creating interesting and substantial characters (at least when they're not being annoyingly silly), and the writing is fine.The story here isn't bad, either...or at least not all bad. Unfortunately, certain elements border on sappy-you-got-to-be-kidding-me. ***News Flash*** Intelligent women don't find guys who profess their love after 2 days and a roll in the hay as romantic or attractive. To the contrary, we think it's a little creepy. It doesn't make our hearts pitter-patter or our cheeks flush red. If only he had stretched the relationship out, I think it might have been more believable and more satisfying. Overall, an easy read with some redeeming qualities but that also panders to cliches and stereotypes. That said, I purchased the second book in the series at the same consignment shop, and I'll read it at some point.

Nicholas Sparks is a popular and accomplished author of many love stories, and this book is no exception. True Believer revolves around the potential love story of two main characters, Lexie Darnell and Jeremy Marsh. It develops with themes of personal sacrifice and the urge to lead where love directs. Jeremy Marsh is a young man from New York City who is famous for debunking myths. On a work trip to Boone Creek, North Carolina he runs into Lexie Darnell. She is a small town girl, and is determined not to let anything or anyone get in the way of her safe, mediocre life. Basically, she is scared of getting her heart broken. The book takes place over the couple days Jeremy is in town and the two begin to develop interest in one another. It turns out, that leads to lots of struggling. This book was a hard read. It was too long and drawn out for me to enjoy. I felt like I was waiting for something to happen the entire time and it didn\u2019t happen until the very last page. It was rather boring and did not strike me as memorable, as nothing exciting really happened until the end. I agree with the author that love is a tricky, difficult subject. However, I do not think it requires as much back and forth nonsense as this story depicted. I think this book leaves out how exciting it is to get to know another person when it comes to \u201cfalling in love\u201d. It only takes place in a weekend and does not develop the relationship between Lexie and Jeremy nearly enough. The one positive thing I have to say about it is the ending. It suggests that sometimes the only way people can come together is through changing your mindset. For Lexie and Jeremy to make it, Jeremy has to learn to believe in the one thing he doesn\u2019t-miracles.Overall, I would not recommend this book due to the lengthy relationship drama it revolves around, but I still can appreciate the message it sends."}, {"userName": "Lauren", "userReviewDate": "Apr 18, 2013", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/7288485-lauren", "userReview": "Before last week, I was a 22 year old girl who had never read a Nicholas Sparks novel or, for that matter, seen one of the movie adaptations of his books. I know! People criticized me for it, and I almost felt like my woman card was going to be revoked or something. To remedy the situation, I bought a huge stack of his work last summer (they were cheap garage-sale finds!), and almost a full year later, I actually sat down to read one. Jeremy Marsh is a science journalist who gets his kicks exposing the smoke and mirrors behind supernatural occurrences. Riding high from a recent investigation that has every major television network begging him to join their teams, Jeremy decides to make a quick trip to North Carolina to expose the mysterious ghost lights in Boone Creek\u2019s graveyard. A blink-and-you\u2019ll-miss-it town with its fair share of eccentrics, Boone Creek doesn\u2019t have much to offer a born and bred New Yorker like Jeremy, but an encounter with a beautiful woman has him thinking all sorts of crazy things.Lexie Darnell is the town librarian and one of the pillars of Boone Creek society. She\u2019s had her experiences with the outside world and decided to come back home, swearing that she\u2019ll never give up her small-town life again. Lexie and Jeremy become smitten, but with both possessing strong, stubborn personalities, how can they possibly make a relationship work when their hearts lie in two different places?Romantic in a non-graphic way (no heaving chests or throbbing members or anything like that) with a hint of the supernatural, this book was\u2026 an interesting take on chick lit, but decidedly not my thing. Not to sound sexist, but I wasn\u2019t a big fan of romance from the man\u2019s perspective simply because it made Lexie a little less relatable to me. Sparks switched back and forth from Lexie to Jeremy\u2019s point of view, but overall, Jeremy was the protagonist, and I couldn\u2019t really understand Lexie\u2019s motivations most of the time. Or, well, I should say I understood it, but I didn\u2019t necessarily believe it. The plot was also very predictable, and the ending was more than a little cheesy.I also wasn\u2019t a big fan of the extra drama Sparks added in. Relationships should be easy! Fun! Laid back! Sparks\u2019 characters make mountains out of molehills, fight about non-issues, lie to avoid talking about their feelings, and run away when things get tough. Life isn\u2019t that hard! I hate being in relationships where people just can\u2019t be honest, I hate hearing from my friends about the drama going on in their love lives, and I hate having to read about it with fictional characters. Big issue? When an ancient curse overpowers your emotions and makes you fight your soul mate to the death to fulfill a blood debt, a la Starcrossed. Little issue? The guy you like lives in a different state.The premise was interesting, and you can tell Sparks is an old pro when it comes to writing: his book opened beautifully, the back stories of the characters were divulged seamlessly, and the writing was eloquent. When it comes to emotions, though, I think Sparks missed the mark."}, {"userName": "Ren\u00e9", "userReviewDate": "Nov 07, 2014", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/8789778-ren", "userReview": "Agh, this book! My grandma gave me this to read, but even she was like, um, yeah, it's kind of lame, so read at your own risk. So, she did warn me, so this is all my fault.I think my problem is that I don't appreciate love stories where the woman gets to act like a raging b*tch because she's been hurt in the past, but the man is supposed to chase after her, even after she pushes him away multiple times. Lexie, our female lead, irritated me because that was all she did. She'd been hurt in the past, so she acted like an arse the whole time, sending mixed signals and getting mad when Jeremy, our male lead, couldn't figure out what she wanted.My other issue was the lack of development of some minor, but still important, characters like Rachel and Rodney. They obviously had key roles, but they stay ghosts that we barely get to know. I would like to have known more about them than freaking bad attitude Lexie and pushover Jeremy.The final issue is that everything was wrapped up by a big dramatic display of affection. I'm not against dramatic shows of affection, but I am when every complication and issue the couple had suddenly becomes unimportant because someone decided to be romantic one day."}, {"userName":

He has just finished exposing a fake television psychic, proving that the man was not able to read people's minds or see into their pasts. When he hears about a phenomenon happening in the small town of Boone Creek in North Carolina, where ghosts are seen inhabiting a local cemetery, Jeremy knows he will be able to find the truth behind the lights that are seen glimmering on certain nights above the cemetery grounds. He knows that ghosts do not truly exist.When Jeremy arrives in Boone Creek, he experiences what small town life is all about. He's from the big city and feels like he's walked into a time warp. Everyone knows everyone, and gossip spreads like wildfire. The very day he arrives in town, Jeremy makes a quick visit to Cedar Creek Cemetery, where the ghosts are reported to have been seen, when he notices a young woman there who catches his eye. He later finds out that her name is Lexie Darnell. Neither of them knows it but soon their lives will be changed forever. Lexie is the granddaughter of the woman who had invited him to visit the town. Doris Marsh is the town psychic.As Jeremy slowly does his research in the library where Lexie happens to work, he gets to know her. Despite what he feels about the town, he finds himself interested in this woman who doesn't seem to want anything to do with him.While Sparks tends to write tragedies as opposed to true romances, this novel is far from the tragedy that some of his other fiction books have been.This is not to say that TRUE BELIEVER wasn't enjoyable. But fans who are looking for the typical Nicholas Sparks book will not find it here. Instead of concentrating on the romance, this reviewer found the focus of the novel to be on the mystery behind the cemetery, and the high point of the plot was Jeremy's answer to the story behind the ghosts. The fact that Jeremy is dating a woman who believes her parents' ghosts have come to her in the cemetery makes the reader anxious to know what he finds, realizing that the answer will greatly impact the relationship that is central to the love story.One aspect of storytelling in which Sparks excels is his ability to create the characters who populate his books. His capacity to bring into being likable, everyday people helps make this novel readable. The strength of the story isn't necessarily the plot, and the romance that is found here is not one that a typical romance reader might expect. For this reader, the characters were the highlight of the novel, and the process of getting to know some of the more prominent ones was a delight. One will find oneself chuckling over some of the antics of the townspeople. The brouhaha that the people make over Jeremy's celebrity is very cute, if not humorous.Overall, the plot lines are balanced between the mystery of the cemetery, Jeremy and Lexie's relationship, the aspect of small-town living, and the individual life stories of the two protagonists. Focusing on the individual characters is just one way of truly enjoying this book. It's a soothing type of read, and readers will feel comfortable with these characters.On that note, TRUE BELIEVER comes recommended."}, {"userName": "Debbie Cordes", "userReviewDate": "Dec 10, 2013", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/26491510-debbie-cordes", "userReview": "I first read this years ago and chose to re-read it because I am going to read the second book 'At First Sight'. I'm not giving it a five because I feel some parts of the book dragged on a bit especially the beginning. I wasn't drawn in as much as I usually am from his books. I didn't feel a strong connection with the characters and parts of it was slow.But I still thoroughly enjoyed it and am looking forward to reading the second book. I enjoyed seeing Jeremy and Lexie fall in love and finally having a happy ending after long distance complications. I'm excited to see how they are coping in the second book.The ending gave me chills, just the perfect ending. Overall a romantic, mysterious and easy to read book.

J\u00e1 vamos na 3 estrelas, mas o livro n\u00e3o conseguiu subir muito mais na minha considera\u00e7\u00e3o. Se Lexie era uma personagem interessante, as outras restantes eram demasiado chatas. Incluindo Jeremy, por momentos pensei em gostar dele, cheguei a tentar. Mas ele agia sempre de maneira t\u00e3o previs\u00edvel que desisti de tentar gostar dele. O romance entre Lexie e Jeremy era t\u00e3o previs\u00edvel n\u00e3o s\u00f3 por ser um livro de Nicholas Sparks, como pelo facto de eles estarem sempre juntos. Demasiado tempo juntos at\u00e9. O romance deles era \"Eu gosto de ti mas vou fazer-me de dif\u00edcil porque sim\". E isso irrita-me profundamente nos livros. Se gost\u00e1mos de algu\u00e9m devemos dizer e pronto. E mais de metade do livro foi assim, eles ali meio que a ter um \"romance\" enquanto trabalhavam juntos. Mas que m\u00e1ximo, e mais originalidade? N\u00e3o? Ok. Sim, fiquei profundamente irritada com este livro, queria mesmo dar-me bem com Nicholas Sparks mas depois deste livro vai ser complicado conseguir integr\u00e1-lo na minha lista de escritores favoritos. Decidi dar 3,5 estrelas devido ao enredo, podia estar muito mais bem desenvolvida claro, mas isso n\u00e3o depende de mim. Gra\u00e7as \u00e0 Lexie, \u00e0s vezes \u00e9s chata mas eu consigo lidar com isso. E claro, tamb\u00e9m \u00e0 escrita de Nicholas Sparks que por vezes consegue ser de outro mundo. E \u00e9 tudo, at\u00e9 uma pr\u00f3xima Nicholas, isto se houver pr\u00f3xima."}, {"userName": "Ellie", "userReviewDate": "Mar 22, 2013", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/14883896-ellie", "userReview": "In True Believer, by Nicholas Sparks, Jeremy Marsh wants to prove that there are no such things as miracles, but a small town Southern sweetheart, Lexie Darnell, gives him reason to believe otherwise, so he takes a chance, and lets himself see what miracles the world has to offer. True Believer takes place in the present day, in Boone Creek, North Carolina. Boone Creek is a town as quiet as a whisper, where few exciting things occur. The population of Boone Creek is miniscule, and most of the people there have known each other for their entire lives. However, this town does have one thing going for it; ghosts. \u201cBlue lights seem to dance on the headstones whenever the fog rolls in\u201d (24). Legend says that the blue lights are ghosts, and Jeremy Marsh, an extreme Non-Believer, comes into town to show everyone that the lights are simply a scientific reaction to light, not ghosts. Jeremy has no doubt in his mind that the lights are about as supernatural as a spoon, and he intends to prove so. He believes that \u201cscience holds the real answers\u201d (49), and it\u2019s not until he meets Lexie Darnell that his beliefs begin to waver. Nicholas Sparks is a talented writer. The way he writes makes writing appear as an effortless task. Sparks makes us feel as if we are in the story itself. He describes the town in detail, and the way the characters react to one another allows us to feel as if we know them. For example, when Lexie sees Jeremy and \u201crecognizes the confident city swagger almost immediately\u201d (59), I think it allows us to infer something about Lexie and Jeremy; Lexie has had a bad experience with someone from the city, and Jeremy has a lot of assurance in himself. The author uses these context clues to help us predict what is to come later in the book. If you are looking for an exciting or challenging book, I would not recommend True Believer; it can be slow at times, and although the writing is good, it\u2019s a very easy read."}, {"userName": "Mitch", "userReviewDate": "Nov 02, 2010", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/2604131-mitch", "userReview": "Ah, Nicholas Sparks sure knows how to cook up a love a story! Although I don't think this is as good as the other Sparks books I read so far (Dear John, A Walk To Remember, and At First Sight), I still think it is pretty decent.Jeremy Marsh is a big-city sceptic who writes for a scientific magazine, uncovering the truth behind psychics, ghosts, and legends. He is sent from New York City to the isolated small town known as Boone Creek to uncover the mystery of strange ghost lights that appear in the local cemetary on foggy nights. There he falls in love with the resident librarian, Lexie. Lexie is sassy and strong-willed, and cares about her town more than almost anything. When she falls in love with Jeremy she becomes closed off because he knows that after he writes his story he will leave back to NYC.This whirl-wind romance is pretty realistic and I love the charater of Doris, which is Lexie's kind-hearted grandmother. Any fan of Mr. Sparks will enjoy this book. However, I enjoy the sequal (At First Sight) a little better."}, {"userName": "Terri", "userReviewDate": "Sep 03, 2010", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/4243391-terri", "userReview": "I have been a fan of Nicholas Sparks books for years. That being said, I had to give this book 3 stars for one reason only. I actually did like the book, I thought it was a great story, it was well-written as always, and it kept me wanting to see what was going to happen next. A little predictable at times, but you have to expect that from a writer whose style you have memorized. He really illustrates the settings, and pulls you into the romance of it all; tears were shed on the pages! However, I found that this story followed the lines of the movie \"Doc Hollywood\" all too much. Throughout the book, this became more and more obvious. If you've never seen the movie, then it won't matter to you! But if you have, I assure you will be making the same comparisons I did. I later went to find other reviews of this book and found the same thing from other readers. If you want a good southern, small-town romance read, you won't be let down with this book. All in all, I liked it a lot."}], "description": "Jeremy Marsh is the ultimate New Yorker: handsome, almost always dressed in black, and part of the media elite. An expert on debunking the supernatural with a regular column in Scientific American, he's just made his first appearance on national TV. When he receives a letter from the tiny town of Boone Creek, North Carolina, about ghostly lights that appear in a legend-shrouded cemetery, he can't resist driving down to investigate. Here, in this tightly knit community, Lexie Darnell runs the town's library, just as her mother did before the accident that left Lexie an orphan. Disappointed by past relationships, including one that lured her away from home, she is sure of one thing: her future is in Boone Creek, close to her grandmother and all the other people she loves. Jeremy expects to spend a quick week in \"the sticks\" before speeding back to the city. But from the moment he sets eyes on Lexie, he is intrigued and attracted to this beautiful woman who speaks with a soft drawl and confounding honesty. And Lexie, while hesitating to trust this outsider, finds herself thinking of Jeremy more than she cares to admit. Now, if they are to be together, Jeremy Marsh must make a difficult choice: return to the life he knows, or do something he's never done before--take a giant leap of faith. A story about taking chances and following your heart, True Believer will make you, too, believe in the miracle of love.", "title": "True Believer\n      \n          (Jeremy Marsh & Lexie Darnell #1)", "url": "http://www.goodreads.com/book/show/3464.True_Believer", "average": 3.8, "cover": "https://images.gr-assets.com/books/1385739017l/3464.jpg", "reviews": 2706, "authors": [{"url": "https://www.goodreads.com/author/show/2345.Nicholas_Sparks", "name": "Nicholas Sparks"}], "type": ["Romance", "Fiction", "Womens Fiction", "Contemporary"], "outlinks": ["http://www.goodreads.com/book/show/3464.True_Believer", "http://www.goodreads.com/book/show/20740903-true-believer", "http://www.goodreads.com/book/show/985962.Fantasmas_del_pasado", "http://www.goodreads.com/book/show/82984.True_Believer", "http://www.goodreads.com/book/show/24868210", "http://www.goodreads.com/book/show/11370439-istinski-vernik", "http://www.goodreads.com/book/show/5953332", "http://www.goodreads.com/book/show/6286302-fantasmas-del-pasado", "http://www.goodreads.com/book/show/6323370-quem-ama-acredita", "http://www.goodreads.com/book/show/7875569-true-believer", "http://www.goodreads.com/book/show/22466260-quem-ama-acredita", "http://www.goodreads.com/book/show/15931.The_Notebook", "http://www.goodreads.com/book/show/3473.A_Walk_to_Remember", "http://www.goodreads.com/book/show/5526.Dear_John", "http://www.goodreads.com/book/show/6400090-the-last-song", "http://www.goodreads.com/book/show/3063499-the-lucky-one"]}
