Unfortunately,\u00a0for some reason did I wait 3 months to write this review, but thanks to screen shots can I retell some of the best parts of this volume where Harley has to save Ivy, puppies and Bruce Wayne? Yes, Bruce is being auctioned off and Harley of course just have to buy him, especially since the money will go to helping animals...But first let's start off with Poison Ivy losing her memory and Harley is trying, in her own way, to help get Ivy's memory back. Since Ivy isn't really Sleeping Beauty doesn't this really work.Oh, and here is the big bad...head that is behind Ivy's memory loss. He is actually just a misunderstood...head.But the best part is at the Charity gala where Bruce Wayne is auctioned off. Of course, the gala is crashed by two bad men trying to rob it. But luckily for Bruce is Harley there to save him.And, of course, she just has to end the night with a kiss...or two...All and all a truly wonderful volume loved it very much and I'm so looking forward to reading the next one. I just hope that Harley's puddin' is in it! ;)Some bonus screenshots:I want to thank the publisher and Edelweiss for providing me with a free copy for an honest review!"}, {"userName": "Karlyflower *The Vampire Ninja, Luminescent Monster & Wendigo Nerd Goddess of Canada (according to The Hulk)*", "userReviewDate": "Aug 25, 2015", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/17243568-karlyflower-the-vampire-ninja-luminescent-monster-wendigo-nerd-godde", "userReview": "GIVE ME THIS ART RIGHT NOW!!!!!THIS ART!!!

Apparently that\u2019s now the format of the series! Amanda Conner and Jimmy Palmiotti write Harley waaaayy out of character and have fashioned her into a do-gooder type who\u2019s created a mob of Harley-ettes who fight crime. That\u2019s the feeble \u201cstory\u201d of this nearly 200 page book!Conner/Palmiotti really don\u2019t know what to do with Harley. She\u2019s a psychiatrist, she\u2019s a landlord, she\u2019s a roller derby gal, she\u2019s chasing romance with Ivy and then some new buff guy, she\u2019s running a small zoo, she\u2019s a burgeoning superhero; I\u2019m not sure why they\u2019ve got her spinning so many plates except to say they\u2019re hoping that all this stuff will somehow amount to something (it doesn\u2019t). Worse though is the tedious storytelling. One overlong sequence has Harley try to bust out Ivy from Arkham so she decides to hijack a small plane and parachute from it into the asylum. After several pages setting this up, she fails, parachutes onto a table of pizza and chows down. She ends up driving a car into Arkham\u2019s gates and gets in that way. I think that was supposed to have us in stitches but it\u2019s so, so unfunny and utterly pointless. After some unnecessary dream sequences, we discover that it was all to add an annoying new character to the mix, a talking egg called Edgar with robot tentacles (really!). That drivel is indicative of this book as a whole. One story has Harley give away puppies, then visit the house of a family who has her favourite puppy and stick around to fix that family or some ridiculous crap. Another one has Harley try to literally kill time because she\u2019s found a grey hair, so she goes after an elderly geezer called Thyme. Oh, my sides. Bruce Wayne is auctioned off for charity and goes on a date with Harley. More dream sequences follow. Are we supposed to be laughing? Entertained? This is desperate, throwaway horseshit that\u2019s just super annoying. The man chasing, the bad comedy, the cutesiness \u2013 it\u2019s like an endless Ally McBeal episode! There\u2019s more but I\u2019ll stop here, pop some aspirin and think of other things. Like Harley, this series is a hot mess."}, {"userName": "Chris ", "userReviewDate": "Sep 18, 2015", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/1956959-chris", "userReview": "[Just don't.

The puppy issue was just odd, but I really, really liked Harley's date with Bruce Wayne. Also, I noticed in this that Harley talks A LOT about helping people. In the first two, she sort of just ended up helping people while fulfilling her psychotic urges. She didn't really ... set out to be a hero. I don't want Harley to be a hero.

We get to see Harley looking for a bunch of people to be her new \"Gang of Harleys\" so that they can help her with everything that's going on (and there is a lot going on), and there's also a little peek into her more mundane everyday life adventures.And if you're not familiar with this relatively new Harley Quinn comic book series, she is now an antihero rather than a villain, and protects the people from her neighborhood.I've seen people complain about half of this being about Harley caring for her animals. But I loved it, I could read hundreds of pages about this woman and her cute, little pets. I really could.\nAnd it's all right, I mean, even villains and superheroes have more \"normal\" things to do, like caring for their tenants and pets. Also, Harley puts so much energy into every little thing she does.I really enjoyed the Valentine's Day special with Bruce Wayne (and I think it was a bit longer than the other stories?). A date with stinking rich Bruce Wayne is up for auction, all the money goes to help kitties and puppies, so Harley plays Robin Hood and takes the money necessary for the auction from a bad, rich guy, to give to the little animals... and score a date with Bruce.We also see a lot of her (love) relationship with Ivy and how she interacts with her friends and love interest, Mason.All the art is very beautiful and it's a big change seeing so much color, I loved this. Gotham's stories are usually very dark. But this is Harley Quinn living in Brooklyn, girl.This is really great for Harley Quinn lovers or anyone who's looking for something entertaining to read, there's not much of a plot here, but short little stories that are actually very fun.More reviews on my blog: \n\nLipstick and Mocha"}, {"userName": "Chris Lemmerman", "userReviewDate": "Jun 24, 2016", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/7530649-chris-lemmerman", "userReview": "Harley Quinn is so popular that DC put out almost as many specials as it does normal issues of the series. Case in point, this volume collects 3 actual issues of the series, and then an Annual, a Christmas Special, and a Valentine's Day Special too.The Annual is all one story in which Harley breaks into Arkham to rescue Poison Ivy, but ends up drugged and trapped in different dream sequences, which are basically just an excuse to use loads of guest artists and charge extra for a book that doesn't really need all those extra pages. It does introduce a new supporting character for the main book though.The Christmas and Valentine's Day Specials are more broken down, with lead stories and then some back-up stuff, but again, they're not really that important. The Christmas story is almost insufferably annoying, whilst the New Year's back-up is a little funnier. The Valentine's Day one is more one-note, and has a Batman cameo which actually works rather than being gratuitous.The three issues of Harley's main series serve to show how much she's juggling at the moment, with her job, her apartment building and its tenants, her roller derby team, and her potential boyfriend Mason Macabre too. It all builds up to a climax which makes sense and has a lot of story potential but of course that's where this volume ends.If Harley spent more time focused on story and less on trying to be funny and having random specials for no reason, I think this volume would likely be better."}, {"userName": "Ame", "userReviewDate": "Oct 01, 2015", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/3004755-ame", "userReview": "These new Harley collections just keep getting better and better! This series has properly illustrated the chaotic good/hot mess that is Harley Quinn. Without the Joker, she has become a destructive heroine with a big heart for babies, animals, baby animals, and anyone that is unwanted or misunderstood. Her methods are unorthodox, but now that Harley is the manager of her own apartment building filled with lovable, quirky folks (working as \"freaks\" in a glorious show), she has a fantastic support system to back up her antics. Harley has a LIFE now, away from Gotham and its obsession with bats. This collection features delightful holiday one-offs, including a V-day themed story about Harley bidding $1 mil and $100 on a date with almost-billionaire Bruce Wayne, which leads to a hilarious dream sequence in which Harley becomes his new Robin and whacky paramour. \nAlso, the most exciting aspect? Harley decides she needs assistants, and hires a dozen ladies to become her \"Gang of Harleys\".

I'm glad I didn't give up. The silliness is tempered out a bit with good storytelling.

There is still some gross humor, but not as over the top. Loved the Batman/Bruce Wayne storyline and the lesson about you might not want what you thought you did when you actually get it.

It's amazing, where once she was a cliche and a clown girl for the Joker she's now so much more, so complex and so fun. I've been reading her books for a while but this book was simply the one that finally drove home to me the fully formed and complex she is (I'll get into that later in the character section). This book is simply perfect.World: The art is all over the place and I love it. I normally really want consistency in my art, but this multiple artists and styles and colors just works for a Harley book. It's gorgeous to look at and it's simply fun. The world building is also wonderful, most of it is to serve the story or the gag or scenario Conner and Palmiotti want to put Harley in but they are slowly and surely building Harley's world up. From the characters she's surrounded herself with to the places she's established, her world is fully formed and full of character, her piece of New York is just fun!Story: Man there are so many here that I don't want to ruin it for you. The stories are the gags and they are the second reason (after the characters) to read this book. They are heartwarming, they are hilarious, insane and laugh out loud. They are cute and fun and badass, they are all what Harley as a character is. The Eggy story, the Old Folks home, the Bruce, the Gang of Harleys they are ALL just fun and that's the main point of this book, to have fun and I had loads and loads and loads of it. Read the book, I won't spoil it for you.Characters: At the core there is of course Harley and this is why this is a 5 star book for me. She's matured and developed as a character, she no longer has to live with the label as 'Joker's Girlfriend' cause that's not all she is and all she can be. Sure, she can still embrace that part of her, but Conner and Palmiotti have made her a fully formed and complex character with her own identity, personalities and voice, it's wonderful. I no longer only imagine an New York accent, now I imagine her having multiple voices and multiple accents and this is because the writers respect and love her. This journey was not jarring at all, if you look back at issue 1 and where we started and at issue 16 where we are now, she's changed, she's become her own woman and she's found her own purpose and I love that about this new Harley. I don't miss the clown girl, I want her to be her and she gets to be in this series. There are so many more parts about her now than just a sad abused clown girl. The rest of the cast are also wonderul, Eggy I loved to bits as he made me laugh so hard with his origin story, and Tony and Ivy and...I can't even list them all. They are fun, they are larger than life and they compliment Harley so well. With the new addition of the gang it will be fun. Oh and I LOVE the diversity that the creative team is bringing to this book. This is the best book in the DC line-up when it comes to representation.I love this book, it's everything that is right about a good comic book. It's creative, it's unexpected, it's deep, it's fun and in 2016 it's diverse. I love this book and I love where they've taken Harley, she's her own woman and I can't be more happy about it.This book is amazing!Onward to the next book!"}, {"userName": "Brandon", "userReviewDate": "Nov 27, 2015", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/30902577-brandon", "userReview": "Volume three of the current Harley Quinn run and yet another five star effort. So far the creative team of Amanda Conner and Jimmy Palmiotti are batting a thousand and this may be the best one yet. This book is a collecting of 'Holiday Specials' and one shots that in most other books would mean a jumbled mess of disjointed stories and inconsistent characters but this is a Harley Quinn book and she is a disjointed, inconsistent mess of woman so it all works. Add in the comic minds of the two writers and I found myself not really caring that every story had guest artists that seemed to cover every aspect of character design and comic book art and that every other story had a hallucinating scene that afford said artists to draw Harley as she had never been drawn before. They must have had blast drawing this book since the only guide lines the artists seemed to have had is to keep Harleys iconic colors and her asymmetrical clothing and than have at it. And they did. There is an abundance of art work in here and Harley comes in all shapes and sizes but it all works cause her wiring ain't right and the writing team will make a sharp left turn on you in a heartbeat. The artwork here may not win any awards as the year comes to an end but all of it fits together in an abstract, crazy, mistress of mayhem, loony tunes kind of way and I loved it.The stories here are all unconnected consisting of a trio of Christmas stories, a scratch and sniff annual one-shot (That does not transfer over to the graphic novel) and the excellent valentines day special which may well be the best single issue ever. It's certainly is my all time favorite full of great comedic writing perfectly complimented by the artwork - the Batmobile covered in 'Bat-shizzle' a classic for all time - and it ends with a three issue run of the current series that finishes way too soon as it introduces the gang of Harley's. In a perfect world DC would release a stand alone graphic novel of holiday tales featuring the first lady of lunacy as imagined by Amanda Conner and Jimmy Palmiotti and volume three of the ongoing series would have more of the monthly series featuring the gang of Harleys than we would get doubly the Harley at Christmastime and twice the outstanding artwork of Chad Hardin but, alas, we don't live in that world but never fear because I want to read this book over again and again and maybe even bring out the other two volumes.

Personally, though, I thought the artwork was rather beautiful and all of the color is what initially drew me in. The artists did a phenomenal job.While the stories included were pretty good, I especially enjoyed the win a date with Bruce Wayne story, I also found that a lot of them were pretty mundane. I wasn't sure how I felt about this at first. There was no denying that the stories were still entertaining, but did I really want to read about a villain shopping for pet food and trying to balance their work, social, and personal life? But the more I thought about it, the more I liked the idea. We're human beings living somewhat mundane lives ourselves, and sometimes it's exciting to see a superhero or villain and know they still have to go through life like the rest of us.The only story I'd say I didn't much appreciate was the last bit where Harley is hiring help for her overcrowded days.

Nonetheless, I like the change, since I tend to find other Batman-related comic books way too dark and murky for my liking (I know, I know). The writing itself was okay. I felt like Harley Quinn is kind of coming into her own a bit in this volume from where she was in the previous volumes, and I liked that about her. This collection contains two \"normal length\" comics and throws in three short \"specials\". I actually really liked the specials, and I'm glad they were included.
