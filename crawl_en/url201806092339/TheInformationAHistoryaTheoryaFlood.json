Must be willing to meet in heavily populated public place.* * * *Aside from that, delving into mathematics as James Gleick tells it (algebra, calculus and Boolean logic, mostly ---A watered down version for us math scarred) makes me want to write a letter to every godawful mediocre monotone high school math teacher I ever had (so, all of them) and give them some major shit for not even bothering. Really? Overhead transparencies of meaningless equations and word problems involving trains and lots of bland white kids was all they had? Worksheets and odd numbered problems in a textbook? If I had only known that math is just another way of describing the world, just, ya know, symbolism like Dostoevsky used, but with numbers, and that all that misery and embarrassment and boredom working equations at the blackboard could actually get me closer to the secrets and meaning(s) of life...So, thanks to James Gleick for that too- late realization and doing what the uninspired mathbots should have done years ago.

I had started reading it last spring before I left Nashville. I was trying to be a good library minion and keep up to date with reading in my field. I got through chapter 7 (1/3 of the book) and decided it was a bit heavy and that I would have enough reading of that sort soon enough in graduate school.So guess what I had to read for my Perspectives in Information class?If I thought this book was difficult before....I HAD NO IDEA. The difficulty lies not in the actual content of the book -- quantum mechanics aside. I found that it truly lies in its narrative style. It is seductively easy to just accept what Gleick states as true. And from some of my other readings, I have learned that this is part of the problem with his premise and conclusion. He believes that throughout time, humanity has slowly made technological advances through the advent of abstract thought and that at each threshold a new framework has been created to help define that technology to society. He discusses everything from the written word to quantum computers. He suggests that these innovations were possible due to an increase in the abstraction of thought which in turn allowed a quantification of information that was not possible before. He introduces the advent of Information Theory, created by Claude Shannon, specifically for an electrical engineering issue concerning noise reduction in telephones. Shannon explained that in his theory, the meaning of the message was not necessary. Later he added that his theory should not be applied to other disciplines because it was meant specifically for an engineering application where meaning did not matter.People did it anyway. However, they did try to apply it to their own specific discipline. And it produced amazing results. Many new subsets of traditional disciplines like physics and biology were born. And many technological advances occurred. The problem is that while James Gleick extols the virtues of abstract thinking and the part it has played in the evolution of technology in our society, he neglects to notice that the greater the abstraction of thought the further we are removed from the reality that the words are supposed to represent. And when you remove the meaning as well, as he blames Claude Shannon for doing, how do you value what remains? Sure it lets us quantify information. But how is that applicable to anything that is based in a subjective reality?In addition, in his attempts to praise the technological innovations of a society grounded in a literal framework, he dismisses any value of societies with an oral foundation. This is too simplistic. In the end, he suggests that the tools we have for organizing information in this new digital world are insufficient. He suggests that the meaning should be reintroduced. I believe that there are purposes for which abstract thought are made. That there are things that can and should be quantified. But that just because we can apply this to some things does not mean that we need to apply it to EVERYTHING. And it is better to leave the meaning intact in some areas as Claude Shannon intended. Though I do agree that we are heading toward a new framework of thought with new definitions to help us understand and describe the new digital world we live in. I just believe that it is a long transition between conceptual frameworks and the evolution takes centuries. Until then I firmly believe that we will continue to use the print framework that we have been using. We will simply adapt it as we have always done."}, {"userName": "Yothgoboufnir", "userReviewDate": "May 24, 2011", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/5388599-yothgoboufnir", "userReview": "The Information has a lot going for it. And it has a lot going against it.For starters, Gleick keeps the read enjoyable with his strong prose style. The author controls the pace and tone of his writing to carry readers along almost cinematically. Indeed, many passages read like the voice-over of a History Channel program, while simultaneously conjuring for readers the images that would play under the voice-over. It is a strong effect, engrossing and enjoyable.The other big strong point of The Information is how wide-ranging -- yet unified -- its topic is. Gleick has, rather conspicuously, rounded up a huge catalog of sources and influences and subjects. I believe if a person is really going to like this book, it will be as an exuberant, unregimented romp through the jungle that is information. The book is ambitious, and looks at the world with the wide eyes of delight ... not the furrowed brow of calculation.And given this combination of the book's ambition and approach, from The Information emerge some weaknesses. The book's treatment of its various subjects is very uneven. Gleick does a good job of impressing on readers how big a shift in mindset literacy generates. He gives an engrossing treatment of talking drums, and he gives an equally engrossing treatment of Charles Babbage and Ada Byron. These subjects together form an informal \"first half\" of the book, and succeed in prompting readers to think through the genesis of information as something (first) represented and (eventually) manipulated in tangible forms like scripts, tones, and gears.Since we today generally take for granted a certain relationship between information, our minds, and our instruments, it is a major accomplishment that Gleick gets us to note that we haven't always lived this way and to think through how we got this way.But after Gleick accomplishes this in the first portion of the book, he falters. His treatment of most subsequent topics is often not cogent. For example, in his treatment of thermodynamic information, he equivocates on what Maxwell's Demon is or isn't, and whether it exists or doesn't. Gleick ends up noting that the demon could not operate, but then he keeps referring to it as if it really does operate, a (presumably) rhetorical move that is pointless and incoherent.Later on, Gleick gives a treatment of both genes and memes that is strangely uninspired. The fact that the book's wide scope requires the treatment of any particular topic to be fairly shallow does not combine well with the fact that almost everyone these days has a passing familiarity with both genes and memes: Gleick says no more than \"the educated layperson\" already knows. In a book on The Information, it seems genes and memes must be discussed as a matter of course -- but these sections don't add value to the book.Moreover, the section on genes was even more deeply flawed. Gleick attributes to Watson and Crick the elucidation of the information content of DNA. He thereby conflates the chemical structure of the DNA molecule with the information structure of the DNA code. This is analogous to saying that the first person who figured out that a charred stick could be used to make marks on slate was the person who figured out writing. Or, it is analogous to saying that the information content of enigma-encrypted Wehrmacht transmissions was retrieved not by the codebreakers at Bletchly Park but by the radio operators who determined what radio frequency the messages were broadcast on. This is a rather profound mistake, considering the subject of The Information.And this major mistake cropped up again and again, in different contexts. Despite his attentiveness to the father of information theory, Shannon, Gleick never got around to explicitly saying what makes something information, nor did Gleick implicitly follow any solid definition of information. This becomes problematic toward the end, where Gleick wants to unify everything under quantum information -- \"it from bit\" -- with the entire universe as a collection of physical-informational states. That is an interesting concept, but it actually has little to do with \"information\" as treated in the rest of the book: alphabets, calculators, cyphers, telegraphs, genes, Wikipedia articles. In all these contexts, something is informational when one physical object stands in for something else -- say, AAG for lysine, or dot-dot-dot for s. Gleick seems aware of this special relationship that defines information (per Shannon), but never pursues it and eventually abandons it. The sense of \"information\" he ends with is simply the notion that at certain levels, such as the level of quarks, the objects of study are indistinguishable from the formalisms by which we know them. That's a deep topic, but it isn't really pursued for its own sake; it is deployed as a rhetorical way to make \"everything\" informational ... even though it's only nominally related to the informational topics discussed in the rest of the book.I found it intriguing that, in the final chapter, Gleick mentions in passing a perfect 1:1 map of everything as suggested by Lewis Carroll. Carroll was quite witty and this map is, of course, absurd. Its absurdity is precisely the problem that arises when Gleick conflates his two kinds of information. A perfect 1:1 map of everything A) would not be a map and B) would not be the thing itself.So there were some deep conceptual problems plaguing The Information. Relatedly, the book lacked form. It was sprawling, and attempts at unification (aside from leading Gleick to embrace absurdities and forget what information even is) fell flat. As Gleick reminds us at the end in his excellent prose, there is a lot of information on the internet, and a lot of particles in the universe -- not exactly a parting thought that leaves readers pondering.Finally, the references are in such bad shape that they warrant comment. None of the main body text has citations of any kind. Multiple times, I looked up authors who were quoted and found no entries in the bibliography! There is a section of \"notes\", which appears to be a collection of endnotes containing citations and comments, presumably for the many unsourced quotations in the book. This section is puzzling, because the text does not actually refer to any notes. I infer that the numerals which signal there is an endnote pertaining to some point in the text have all been removed from the book, but the notes themselves retained. Presumably the in-text designation of notes was removed to make the text appear readable rather than intimidating. A rigorously sourced book suggests to readers it is meant to be taken seriously; apparently it was decided that that would send the wrong impression for this book.-Bottom line:The Information was fun and interesting. The first half was especially strong, even illuminating. But there were also serious conceptual and formal problems that prevented the book's content from matching the potential of such an ambitious topic. The book is much more likely to reward casual reading than serious or repeated reading."}, {"userName": "Trevor", "userReviewDate": "Apr 17, 2011", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/175635-trevor", "userReview": "I think this is perhaps as good an introduction to information theory as you are likely to read. Lucid, clear and quite nicely paced, it covers a wealth of material and it does so with beautiful ease. This guy really is a wonderful science writer. His Chaos and Newton were both stunning books. I got about half of the way through Genius, but then got distracted and never quite made it back \u2013 but I\u2019ve always meant to. All the same, this one shines and shines.Perhaps the best chapter was the one on randomness. Randomness is such a tricky concept, but oddly, not something we generally really think about. Just how do you go about proving that a series of numbers is, in fact, random? The problem is that we humans are hopeless at spotting randomness. This is partly because we are such excellent pattern picking machines that we even spot patterns when there are none. And then we also tend to think there must be a pattern if there is repetition, but random sequences have odd repetitions too. All this means we tend to think things that aren\u2019t random are in fact random and vice versa.The definition of randomness is that there is, in a string of numbers, a one in ten chance that you will be able to pick the next number in the sequence \u2013 in a random series you will have a one in ten chance \u2013 if you can do better than this chance at picking the number then you must have an algorithm to help you pick the next number and that means the next number can\u2019t be random.His discussion of Turing, not just his test but also his machine and incalculable numbers, is highly readable and clear. His discussion of G\u00f6del is somewhat less clear, but than I\u2019m yet to have read a perfectly clear description of the incompleteness theorem \u2013 which might say more about me than it does about the descriptions I have read, who knows. This one is still good, even if it remains over my head. However, there is a wonderful discussion of the relationship between information and entropy and why entropy is an important concept for people to understand, as good an explanation as any I have ever read.The early parts of the book are a joy. The stuff about the barbed wire telegraphs is particularly fascinating. As was his explanation of why multistorey buildings needed the telephone to be invented as much as they needed lifts.I was less impressed by the discussion of memes, but mostly because I don\u2019t find this nearly as useful a metaphor as others do and worry when ideas that are clearly meant to be provocative end up being taken much more seriously than they warrant. Selfish genes and selfish memes, with their characteristic inversion of common sense, tend to become Blackmore\u2019s \u2018self-plex\u2019 and the end of human freewill and identity and therefore take a joke all a little too far.The discussion at the very start of this book about African talking drums is virtually worth the cover price alone. I had never realised that these communicate \u2018tonally\u2019 and that to make them work the drummer must add lots of redundancy to the message, almost like a convention of sub-phrases. This was a wonderful description of why redundancy is necessary to messages and said interesting things about Western racism. Westerners simply could not believe these drums actually could send messages or that they were not being sent by a kind of Morse Code.This book really is a pleasure and on a fascinating topic that is deftly handled by one of the best science writers alive."}, {"userName": "Mara", "userReviewDate": "Sep 11, 2014", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/1923002-mara", "userReview": "The amount of information (pun acknowledged, but not intended) that \n\nJames Gleick\n\n was able to contain in the book is mind-boggling (\nClaude Shannon\n could probably tell you what the physical cost of the logical work my mind did while reading it was, but I, alas, cannot).I'm sure that for those who are well-versed in information theory, some of his omissions were glaring and seemingly arbitrary, but there is nothing wrong with a book that leaves you wanting more and feeling sufficiently motivated to go out and find it.\n\nThe Information\n\n, with all that it contains, is a likely candidate for the list of non-fiction books I loved, took copious notes on while reading, and would recommend, but fail to review because there is just so much to be said.

The more complicated and obtuse it gets, the more I like it. It is probably best I didn't figure this out earlier in life, because I might have pursued it and gone crazy. So I enjoy reading about it from time to time.In The Information, Gleick speaks to the interplay between mathematical progress with science, culture, information theory, and really the development of society. It is an incredible overview of topics ranging from logic to communication to memes. It is DENSE. I spread my reading over a few weeks, a chapter here, a chapter there. When the information started going over my head, I gleefully skimmed it until I could sink back in. The formulas meant very little but then he put musical fragments into it with no explanation, and at least I understood those.The chapter that first captured me detailed the history of the OED. I loved the logic chapter, talking about Boole and his contributions, someone very important to library theory and I never really knew anything about where all of that came from. It was the last chapter, as well as the epilogue, where Gleick steps beyond his thorough research to offer a few opinions on the direction of information and information overload, that I think the book really shines, or at least, where it was most interesting/useful to me. I don't know enough to speak to the accuracy of this book, but I feel like I learned a lot, as well as adding a bunch of other books to read to my list that he cites.

To the point where the meaning of information becomes irrelevant. To the point where the universe itself can be seen as a giant computer, and each of our choices, thoughts, movements become like states in the machine. I loved reading about the African drummers who communicated over long distances via a tonal drum language with built in redundancy. I loved reading about Babbage and his calculating machine, and to think about it as a kind of steam-punk calculator fantasy world of the future. I loved reading about people decrying the telegraph and the telephone as technologies that will ruin humanity. And to read about the shortening of telegraph messages to save time and money, with phrases like wyegfef which stands for 'will you exchange gold for eastern funds?' which is interesting because here we are in 2012 coming full circle, a form of regression maybe, by using codes like ROFLOL and BRB in our chatboxes and cellphones. And also that the telegraph reminds me a bit of twitter in its shortness. I didn't love reading about Godel and Turing and Shannon, but only because I've read so much about them already in other books just like this one, but it was still interesting enough. I liked reading about genes and the gene code ok, but I really loved reading about quantum computers because I knew next to nothing about them. Something I never thought about before is how a message sent using a quantum computer cannot be intercepted or wiretapped because of Heisenberg's principle which says that you can't look at a quantum particle without effecting it, so in effect the intercepter cannot go undetected! This blew my mind. I loved reading the more philosophical chapters about how we have too much information for us to ever process, and how we must now deal with it. I loved reading about the library of babel and borges of course, how could I not? I loved thinking about how we have too much information and how everything is documented. \"It did not occur to Sophocle's audiences that it would be sad for his plays to be lost; they enjoyed the show\". I thought about that and I thought about how every performance, ceremony, or event that I've been to in the last year or so has been recorded on video (and probably up on YouTube already) and how or whether that took away from the experience, whether knowing something will be archived later makes you pay attention less now, or is it a form of insurance, a kind of just-in-case, which then made me wonder how many times I (or anyone) will ever go and watch those videos again. I thought about the last chapters and how Google and other search engines are our only means of not being completely lost in meaningless data and then I thought about how much power the role of a search engine is, to make sense of the information is also to hold all the power, to control the information, to control what information people see or don't see.

Luckily for me, I knew how to manipulate money long before I went to school, so the patterns in math were already obvious. Then suddenly there were these little xs and ys and I was completely thrown for a loop! \u201cWhy are these letters slinking around with my beloved numbers?\u201d I thought. Gee, I wish my teacher had just given me Charles Babbage to read. After the initial shock, the patterns that I knew so well did return and I moved on, loving algebra, but the process would have been so much smoother had someone simply told me to think of the \u201cx\u201d as an empty box waiting for the right number to complete the pattern!I am not a math and science whiz by any stretch of the imagination; I am, however, in awe of both and always have been. As far as I\u2019m concerned, it takes a bazillion times more creativity to discover and prove a math or science concept than it does to write a story or poem. Literature is limited by the human experience and needs no proof. Math and science have no limits\u2014think universe and \u221e\u2014and if you are unable to prove your theory, you will not become a part of the conversation unless, of course, someone else can prove your theory.The Information, as I see it, is about just that, extraordinary people seeing the patterns first, forming a theory, beginning their proofs, and others building on those proofs until new understandings emerge. It\u2019s an exciting and wonderful journey! If you are the type of person that must understand and see clearly every concept mentioned in the book you are reading, don\u2019t pick this one up. (Although, I\u2019ve never understood why people who can read Oscar Wilde or T. S. Eliot comfortably can become so uncomfortable reading a book like Mr. Gleick\u2019s that they would put it down and consider it too difficult to understand.) I have a high tolerance for the vague; it doesn\u2019t bother me. There is a lot in this book that is vague to me, but I was constantly rewarded with so many \u201cAh ha!\u201d moments that it did not interfere with my total enjoyment. For example, how do you write about a theory before there are clear and concise words to describe it? Words that everyone can agree upon must first be written about. \u201c...where Newton wanted words for nature\u2019s laws, Wittgenstein wanted words for words...\u201d The limitation of words is that you must use words to describe them! Did you know that your teenager wasn\u2019t the first to use expressions such as \u201clol\u201d and \u201cbff\u201d to communicate? I did not, but when telegrams were charged by the word, people adapted by doing exactly the same thing\u2014see page 154. Then there is the redundancy in language factor demonstrated nicely by one of my favorites, the James Merrill poem and 1970s subway sign \u201cIf U Cn Rd Ths, u cn gt a gd jb w hi pa.\u201d \u201cBit\u201d is a combination of binary and digit. Duh, but I truly did not know this!Near the end of the story, we go from bits to bytes, to megabytes, gigabytes, terabytes and I found myself reading faster and faster and... as if experiencing the John Lanier quote, \u201cIt\u2019s as if you kneel to plant the seed of a tree and it grows so fast that it swallows your whole town before you can even rise to your feet,\u201d up close and personal.

Quite honestly, I'm tending toward the Goodreads consensus of four stars, leaning to a high three. And the reasons for that are quite specific.Gleick pulls all the right ingredients together - Charles Babbage, Lady Ada Lovelace, Claude Shannon, Alan Turing, Kurt Godel, Norbert Wiener. He gives us unique quotes from Lady Lovelace's letters, odd anecdotes of Shannon and Godel meeting at Princeton. The book is lively and readable for the most part, though the odd algebraic algorithm might scare some people. And yet, and yet.... Something feels like a perfectly prepared pudding or souffle that wasn't cooked at the right temperature, leading to a failure to set properly.Perhaps the problem is that Gleick set a high bar for himself with \"Chaos\", and a high bar was set for incompleteness theorem and information with Douglas Hofstadter's \"Godel Escher Bach: An Eternal Golden Braid.\" Gleick quotes at length from Hofstadter, to be sure, but he doesn't achieve quite the sense of astonishment and whimsy that Hofstadter did when GEB first came out in the early 1980s. Maybe I was expecting Gleick to provide a new theory of what happens when incompleteness meets infinite recursiveness meets the compressed-code condition where a single symbol stands for a universe of meaning. Maybe that was a ridiculous expectation.This book makes a wonderful companion to Hofstadter's GEB, William Gibson's \"The Difference Engine\", and similar works. It makes Shannon and Turing seem like real people, though it does not delve into the heartache of Turing's persecution as a homosexual, which several biographies of Turing have done. Gleick ends the book with a marvelous treatise on Wikipedia's reason for being in this world, and a suggestion that we are running into a new recursiveness when an ever-expanding Wikipedia begins to stand for all sentient knowledge in the universe - have we gained anything in library management or data compression? Still, Gleick manages to end the book on an optimistic note, not wringing his hands too anxiously over information overload, etc.Remember, a pudding or souffle that comes out of the oven a little too runny still can make for good eating, and Gleick's book is often yummy. Just don't expect \"The Information\" to reach new frontiers of information theory. It's just a dime map of the reef, and that's OK."}, {"userName": "Joshua", "userReviewDate": "Mar 01, 2011", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/646605-joshua", "userReview": "I enjoyed reading this book thoroughly. However, I do not think it will satisfy everyone who is considering reading it. I know many of my librarian colleagues and my classmates from the School of Information probably have this on their to-read lists. Many of them are probably more interested in contemporary issues of information management, such as information retrieval, social network analysis and human-computer interaction. This book touches some of those issues, and indeed many others, but this book is primarily about the history of information theory. The subtitle of the book is \"A History, A Theory, A Flood,\" but the Flood part is only discussed in the final chapters. The rest of it is devoted to the theory and history.You can tell that Gleick has spent his career writing biographies and histories of physicists and mathematicians, because those subjects are covered in greater detail in this book. The two most prominent individuals that Gleick focuses upon are Charles Babbage and Claude Shannon. If you're interested in the history of science, math and philosophy, or if you would like a good explanation of information theory (which I think most people do not understand correctly) then I would recommend this book. Otherwise, this book may not be what you are hoping it to be.If you are into that sort of thing, then this book will be a fun read for you. I found it extremely fascinating. A couple passages that made me pause:An amusing quip on entropy: \"Living things manage to remain unstable.\" Indeed. Increased entropy is the natural progression of the universe. But living things maintain an organized state, which is highly anti-entropic. Hence, we are all unstable people!On memes: \"...rhyme and rhythm help bits of text get remembered. Rhyme and rhythm are qualities that aid a meme's survival, just as strength and speed aid an animal's. Patterned language has an evolutionary advantage. Rhyme, rhythm, reason--for reason, too, is a form of pattern.\" This is an interesting thought. Reason as simply a pattern--a memory aid."}, {"userName": "Katie", "userReviewDate": "Dec 07, 2011", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/2492588-katie", "userReview": "A wonderful and eclectic book that gave me a new perspective. I'm not sure how this book reads for those already versed in information theory - I think it's largely designed for those who are not - but it's a great introduction to the subject. Gleick is especially got at illustrating how wide-ranging this subject is, and how innovations from people like Claude Shannon or Alan Turing rippled out into fields as diverse as linguistics, genetics, and psychology. It's rare that an introductory book can legitimately offer a slightly different way of viewing the world while still remaining grounded and accurate, but this work pulls it off beautifully.

It's also been a characteristic of life since the advent of written language. And probably before that, but we can never know.I've been interested in information theory as it pertains to general systems theory in my undergraduate studies on the systems novel, and my quest of reading what Tom LeClair has dubbed the \"systext\" (a macro-novel made up of seven meganovels). However, to this point, I didn't have much reading in it beyond literary criticism, and the mastery of fictioneers like Pynchon whose forms and themes and concepts embody the core theory of information and communication. Gleick's book is an encyclopaedia of information's history, its theory and where we're at right now. In these senses it is an utter success. He maps the history of mass communication from beating drums in Africa to the most basic and indivisible form: the bit.The closing 3 chapters focus on where we are right now in our information-laden culture, with particular emphasis on Wikipedia as the real-life equivalent of Borges's library. These chapters are good, but feel a bit less \"significant\" than the rest of the book. In the closing, Gleick makes a compelling shift back toward the message and meaning and how we are the meaning-makers and information, essentially, lacks meaning until we interact with it, organize it.Also of great interest to me, and deeply affecting, was the scientific evolution of understanding information theory to finally understand our most basic atoms of information: genetics. It re-configures understanding about life and humanity to understand ourselves as computers. Processors of information. Information in the form of genetic code.If you're interested in information and communication theory, want to understand entropy better, get a compelling history of how humans have been creating devices of mass communication and computing for centuries, read this book.

After all, what is there to say about a concept that we all commonly refer to, understand, and take for granted? Quite a bit, as it turns out.The good news is that this is not another book about the history of computing, from the Gutenberg press to the Macintosh. There are more than enough books on that topic. So, exactly what is it about? It's hard to be succinct about that. It might be better to offer a listing of broad topics covered.He starts with the most basic of communication systems: the African drum -- a method of communication over distances that surprised early european colonizers with its apparent accuracy and specificity. From here, he moves to Babbage's mechanical difference engine and the first organized thoughts about the nature of information itself. When one has to carry out mechanical computation, it seems to be universal that an analysis of what comprises information quickly ensues. A new branch of philosophy is born.Succeeding chapters cover technologies we typically associate with the transmission of information: telegraphy and telephony. Telegraphy introduces the idea of creating one set of symbols that can represent another set. In this case, dots and dashes for an alphabet. Twenty six characters are reduced to two. Telegraphy also introduced the need to reduce even further the number of characters by which a message could be clearly received, as in representing common phrases by a series of three digit numbers. Such a reduction costs the transmitter less money to send and enables the owner of the system to send more messages in the same time, earning them more money. This is information compression in its simplest form. Sending a message through an intermediary (a telegrapher) also means that you might want to hide the meaning of the message from them. This leads to ciphers and other methods of encoding. The sender and the receiver share a common key for decoding.Telephony reduced the barriers to telecommunication by reducing the middle man, saved money for businesses by reducing the need for messengers and increasing the speed of messages. Telephony also drove further information technology innovations. Phone companies (or THE phone company at the time) devoted considerable resources to dealing with problems of long distance transmission of voice information over inherently \"lossy\" copper wires. Sifting meaningful signal from distance-induced static and noise became of focus of some particularly talented engineers. Analysis of this problem lead to mathematical abstractions as they tried to reduce \"information\" to the lowest possible common denominator. How small of a signal can carry a message? How can \"message\" be defined mathematically? The idea of the \"bit\" became common and the field of information theory began to take off. It had existed before, but it had never flowered in the way that modern communications forced it to. Claude Shannon is a central figure in the development of modern information theory and his revolutionary ideas are quoted extensively throughout the book. Parallel developments in information theory occurred with Alan Turing who developed the theoretical basis for computing before any of the hardware existed.Some familiar computing history themes are then covered in which Gleick reviews projects undertaken during World War II to create mechanical systems capable of shooting down fast moving aircraft from the ground. These projects produced mathematical methods for estimating random motion and predicting probabilities, problems very similar to the efforts of phone engineers to separate signal from noise.What Gleick tries to get across is the idea that the developments in information theory, some of which are concepts that we take for granted today, are in fact not intuitive at all. The idea that all information could be conveyed by nothing more than two states, on and off, yes or no, was revolutionary. For people of the era, these ideas would be like suggesting the existence of a new color that no one had ever imagined before. Shocking, like an intuitive leap that seemed to come from nowhere.Information theory has implications for...well, just about everything in existence. It has implications for biology. The basic units of heredity, the genes, carry a certain number of bits of information needed to describe traits. DNA molecules can be thought of as biological memory storage devices, mere transmitters of information. It also has things to say about memes, self-replicating packets of information. Gleick quotes Dawkins and wonders if they're like genes, existing to propagate themselves.Towards the end of the book, he advances to modern developments of the past 30 years or so such as information compression and quantum information science. As part of this journey, Gleick tries to cover some very challenging mathematical topics like randomness, incompleteness theorems, the absolute computability of numbers and chaos. These sections are less successful. I got the feeling that he felt the need to include them, but felt that he could not adequately reduce them to a level that even an industrious layman could handle. Many terms are introduced which are never thoroughly explained, or which are explained tautologically, using poorly explained concepts to label new ones.Finally, he ends with a light analysis of the cultural implications of the info-clogged modern world: information fatigue, information glut, and the devaluation of information that is ubiquitously available for the first time in history.This is a big topic...indeed, a massive one. While \"The Information\" rambles on in places and seems disjointed in others, it's an important book. It brings the philosophy and science of information itself to a lay audience. Mathematicians and philosophers will be familiar with many of the concepts it contains, but this may be the first book that attempts to bring these rigorously technical fields to the masses in an easily digestible form."}, {"userName": "Charlene", "userReviewDate": "Aug 24, 2015", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/2531665-charlene", "userReview": "I love the history of science and no one gives a better history than Gleick. If you loved Chaos, you will love this. I have read several books on information theory and have really enjoyed them. But, Gleick really knows how to convey almost every concept to his reader in the simplest, yet surprisingly complete, way. I have been annoyed with Richard Dawkins for many years now. I used to love him, but once epigenetics came on the scene and he threw fit after fit, not to mention the fit he threw about endosymbiosis, it is clear his time as an effective scientists has passed. However, Gleick's take on the selfish gene and its place in history reminded me about everything I once loved about Dawkins. From Shannon to Gamow, this book did justice to so many of the researchers whose passions gave rise to information theory. It is not as heavy on the science as some people might like, but the history is incredibly rich and interesting. I enjoyed it far more than Isaacson's The Innovators.

The origin and impact of writing, the challenge of conveying messages across a distance (exemplified by the talking drums of Africa as well as by the varieties of telegraph), the invention of printing, the development of information theory, the rise of computing, aspects of the history of dictionaries and encyclopedias, including the growth of Wikipedia: all that is here, along with discussions of mathematical logic, codes and code-breaking, quantum theory, cybernetics, genetics, memetics, and info-glut (a current complaint with a surprisingly long history).Does that sound like a morass of abstraction? Quite likely. But the book is an orderly thing\u2014quite fitting, given that order and its opposite number, entropy, weigh heavily here; it\u2019s clear, elegant, and in many ways quite down-to-earth. It has a story to tell, which progresses more or less chronologically from prehistory to the present. It even has a hero: Claude Shannon, a mathematician employed by Bell Telephone Laboratories who, in the middle of the 20th century, founded the entire field of information theory. You may not know his name, but you will have heard one of his ideas; in a groundbreaking paper published in 1948, the same year the transistor was invented (also at Bell Labs), Shannon proposed that units of information \u201cmay be called binary digits, or more briefly, bits.\u201d (A tantalizing endnote reports that Shannon got the term from a Bell Labs researcher named John W. Tukey.) As Gleick unfolds his tale, one begins to grasp what he\u2019s getting at in his oddly worded title. Information is history, in that history is essentially a set of recorded statements, but it\u2019s also something that has a history, and it\u2019s a theory as well, and it\u2019s another name for the sense impressions, including written words, with which the world increasingly inundates us. About halfway through, Gleick gives us Shannon\u2019s central equation (I can\u2019t reproduce it here exactly as Gleick presents it) and goes on to say that H, the quantity it defines, is \u201cconventionally called the entropy of a message, or the Shannon entropy, or, simply, the information.\u201d Hence the first two words of the title. The world is a message; this book is Gleick\u2019s way of coming to grips with what that means.Here and there, one might wish for slight differences in the treatment. Gleick emphasizes the evanescence of oral communication and the persistence of writing, but both could stand to be qualified. Oral expressions didn\u2019t always vanish on the wind, else Homer\u2019s work wouldn\u2019t have survived to be recorded, nor would cultural memories of a great flood. Likewise, the written word can be impermanent; Gleick does make this point, by reference to the burning of the library at Alexandria, but he does so late in the book, a good ways after his discussion of the transition from orality to writing.Though Gregory Bateson makes a brief appearance, Gleick doesn\u2019t include Bateson\u2019s memorable suggestion that a piece of information is any difference that makes a difference. (There\u2019s some dispute over exactly what Bateson said and exactly what it meant, but its import seems solid enough to me.) The concept Bateson was trying to elucidate nonetheless comes through clearly; it\u2019s implicit in telegraphic transmissions, for instance, which employ a difference between sound and silence and, where there is sound, a difference in duration between a dot and a dash. And Gleick does quote\u2014among many other choice gleanings\u2014the version of the Second Law of Thermodynamics that Tom Stoppard conceived for a character in Arcadia, \u201cYou cannot stir things apart,\u201d which ranks as one of the best plain-language statements of a scientific principle yet devised.Gleick has accomplished something important here, drawing together and distilling far-flung, seemingly unrelated elements, casting all our recent talk of an information age in a far broader context. Who would expect to find in one volume Robert Burton, Charles Babbage, Jorge Luis Borges, and Francis Crick? (Very few women appear, among them Ada Lovelace.) In a way, the book does what science itself does: it reveals an unseen order. I found it wondrous even though I already knew much of this in outline. The Information feels enormous (but isn\u2019t\u2014like Doctor Who\u2019s vehicle, it\u2019s bigger on the inside) and complete yet may leave you wanting more. Those who do can pursue Gleick\u2019s sources in the notes and the bibliography, which together occupy 74 pages after the text."}, {"userName": "Brian Clegg", "userReviewDate": "Mar 28, 2012", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/6100646-brian-clegg", "userReview": "A new book by James Gleick is a much-anticipated thing. Admittedly he hasn't always lived up to the promise of his excellent Chaos, but most of his books have been top notch.In The Information, Gleick gives us a full bore account of the defining feature of our age. We explore the nature of information, how it has been communicated from the written word and jungle drums through to the internet, and, perhaps most fascinating of all, Gleick takes us through the social historical impact of a burgeoning quantity of information. It's fascinating that the whole idea of information overload was first brought up not as a result of the internet, but hundreds of years earlier as a response to the flood of information that the printing press released on the world. And then again for microfilm.Rather oddly for someone who has made their name as a science writer, Gleick comes across best in the social history sections. The more detailed the science, the more he loses us. In part this is down to the Claude Shannon effect. Shannon is an absolutely central figure in information theory, and yet every book I've ever read that featured him gets dull when he is mentioned. I don't know why, exactly, but Shannon is like one of those people at parties who can be talking about the most exciting subject and yet make it depressingly boring.You can't write a book like this without having a lot of Shannon turning up, but it does make it difficult for the writer to keep the reader's attention. I also thought that Gleick could have made more of the whole 'it from bit' cosmological theory - it comes across very vaguely, without the scientific backing you might expect. But there is so much more to enjoy, whether it's one of the best accounts of Babbage and Ada King (not Lovelace) and the emerging concept of computing, or Turing's work, or telegraphy wireless and otherwise. It's a rich (if not always well-structured) concoction of information about information.There's so much information in there, you suspect that Gleick's research was occasionally a bit thin. So, for instance, he refers to the transistor pioneer William Shockley as an Englishman. Shockley was an American, brought up in America. The only reason I can imagine anyone calling him English is that when you glance at his Wikipedia entry (and yes, Wikipedia gets a fascinating write-up in the book), it jumps out of you that he was born in London. Read a little further, though, and you'll see this is just because his American parents happened to be there at the time.I do also have a couple of small issues with this book as a whole. Firstly it's a doorstop. I seriously dislike books this thick, and it's a mark of how good the good parts are that I put up with a 526 page tome. There are a couple of chapters that could be done away with entirely, and there's a lot of unnecessary flowery text. The other issue is that it can stray a little into the pretentious. This comes across perhaps most strongly in the title - putting 'The' upfront feels very calculated.However, The Information does squeak in as a five star book, partly because the subject is so central to twenty-first century civilization (I find it difficult to think of a day when I haven't used the internet or touched a book) - and partly because when Gleick's writing is going brilliantly, which is for well over half the book, he is compelling to read. This is a truly interesting book, even if you may have to skip a few bits to get through it. And it is one you ought to have on your shelf.

To begin with, the actual title and the informational content of the book don\u2019t really seem to jibe. There\u2019s too much biographical information here, and of too many people, for the entire book to cohere in any meaningful way. The connection that one chapter has to the next is tenuous at best. For example, Gleick starts out talking about the ways in which African drummers drum in order to retain the information in a message over long distances (an fascinating way to the begin talking about information as a broad subject), but then almost inexplicably jumps directly into a short history of early English dictionary-making in the next chapter, and follows that with a history of the work Charles Babbage and Ada Byron Lovelace did together, including the Difference Machine and the Analytical Machine. Connecting them is only the thinnest of threads \u2013 the work of Claude Shannon and the birth of information theory - which isn\u2019t even substantively developed until halfway through the book. Because of this, the whole endeavor ends up being a mile wide and an inch deep.Is it just me, or does most non-technical science- or technology-oriented writing \u201cThe Information\u201d read this way? The narrative net seems like it needs to be cast so far and wide that even those readers who might be put to sleep reading about something like information theory (why are these people reading this book in the first place?) will be able to maintain their interest. It can mostly be avoided when the subject is narrowed to the life and/or ideas of one person, as in Gleick\u2019s previous book on Isaac Newton, though I found that book a little unsatisfying for a different reason: I thought it was much too short.To give off the sense that this book wasn\u2019t fun to read would be unfair. If you\u2019re broadly interested in the history of science, this provides as a good introduction to a number of topics: in addition to the ones already mentioned, Gleick discusses telegraphy, the birth of statistical mechanics in physics and the concept of entropy, and the rise and difficulties of quantum computing. It\u2019s just that the star of the show, the history of how \u201cinformation\u201d has been treated as such, suffers tremendously.I picked it up because 1) it was on the discount shelf at Barnes&Noble for a reasonable price (and if you can get it for six dollars, I would still say it\u2019s worth investing in), and 2) I felt that my knowledge of information theory would be insufficient for a book that demanded a readership with more expertise. For those interested in something like the history of computing, this would be a wonderful place to start. Anyone expecting something more tightly focused on the likes of Claude Shannon, Norbert Weiner, their colleagues, and the development of fields like information theory and cybernetics will walk away wishing for something much more focused."}, {"userName": "Jamie", "userReviewDate": "Aug 23, 2011", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/1385106-jamie", "userReview": "Jame's Gleick's The Information: A History, a Theory, a Flood is kind of all over the place, as you might expect given its nebulous subject matter. The author intends to do pretty much what the subtitle suggests: review the history of information as a concept, dive into the scientific field of information theory, and ponder what recent volume of information flow means for us as a society or even as a species. As such, it's a mix of history, hard science, and even a dash of speculation.My favorite parts of the book were the history of science bits, which Gleick presents after what seems to be exhaustive and comprehensive research. He traces the evolution of information as a concept, starting around the invention of the written word, then working up through the time line and pointing out landmarks like the printing press, the discovery of logarithms, the telegraph, Morse code, the telephone, the computer, the Internet, and the like. Each of these is discussed in the context of how they shaped the abstract concept of \"information\" and all led to the inevitable creation of a theory of information. I also loved learning about all the people behind these inventions and discoveries, and Gleick delivers the best bits of biographies on characters like Samuel Morse, Alan Turing, Charles Babbage, Ada Lovelace (nee Byron), Claude Shannon, James Maxwell, and more. These parts of the book were replete with fun facts and amusing stories, like the woman who tried to \"send\" a bowl of sauerkraut by the newly invented telegraph or how the editors of the Oxford Dictionary decide what new words to add each edition. It's all very educational and made me think of information and the information technology around me in new ways. I always love learning about visionaries and how they made their mark.The sections on the formal theory of information, though, were also enjoyable, but to my layman mind they were sometimes dense to the point of being impenetrable. Gleick doesn't shy away from the hard stuff, and his discussion of information theory is flung far enough to cover many fields: mathematics, cybernetics, quantum theory, psychology, electrical engineering, chemistry, astrophysics, computer programming, genetics, history, cryptology, and more. And while Gleick doesn't revel in jargon and he makes many attempts to keep things at a high level, much of the book is unavoidably scholarly. Still, I was usually able to follow along with the WHAT he was getting at, if not the HOW. And it really is impressive how widely he casts his net.And I'm glad I did. While some of the finer points may have been lost on me, I enjoyed the history of science treatment and got enough of it to get a feel for the shape of information theory and how the general concept of information has evolved and been revealed through advances in philosophy, science, and technology --what it is, how it's measured, where it goes, and what its properties are.

I couldn't get enough of how things worked.James Gleick follows in the Asimov tradition as a science writer for the masses but he gets in pretty deep.The book is divided as the title describes into three sections - one about the history of information, one about the theory that developed to explain it, and finally a look at the flood of it that we are now experiencing. Throughout is that wonderful sense of excitement, discovery and adventurous thinking that Asimov was so good at relating.There are many remarkable things in this book, one of which is an account of how writing changed the way we think from what it had been before. A different mental operation is at work when you relate things aurally, about things that you have seen, than when you write in symbols that bring up concepts that cannot be physically experienced. Also mentioned is the fact that writing is not evolutionary - in the sense that stone-age humans would have been able to write if they were instructed; The potential has been there all along. This kind of thing makes me eager to turn every page for more.When Gleick gets into the theory of information even more fascination awaits. What is the information content of a printed character, of a dot or a dash of Morse code, of a photo? Much thinking went into analysis of communication before Claude Shannon came up with a formula for specifying the amount of information precisely - it has to do with novelty, unpredictability, and complexity but is completely independent of the meaning we place on communication. Now do I have your interest?But things get deep. Here is an example from where I got completely lost...\" 'Feynman's insight,' says Bennett, 'was that a quantum system is, in a sense, computing its own future all the time. You may say it's an analog computer of its own dynamics.' Researchers quickly realized that if a quantum computer had special powers in cutting though problems in simulating physics, it might be able to solve other types of intractable problems as well.\"Have you got that? Fortunately, the book doesn't often get this deep and right after the above quote the author leaves the theory for the flood section - much easier to swallow!So step right up and challenge your mind to a roller coaster ride. There will be times when you will s-l-o-w d-o-w-n just as a coaster does when climbing the first height, but then you will find elation as you zoom into new ideas!"}], "description": "James Gleick, the author of the best sellers Chaos and Genius, now brings us a work just as astonishing and masterly: a revelatory chronicle and meditation that shows how information has become the modern era\u2019s defining quality\u2014the blood, the fuel, the vital principle of our world. \u00a0The story of information begins in a time profoundly unlike our own, when every thought and utterance vanishes as soon as it is born. From the invention of scripts and alphabets to the long-misunderstood talking drums of Africa, Gleick tells the story of information technologies that changed the very nature of human consciousness. He provides portraits of the key figures contributing to the inexorable development of our modern understanding of information: Charles Babbage, the idiosyncratic inventor of the first great mechanical computer; Ada Byron, the brilliant and doomed daughter of the poet, who became the first true programmer; pivotal figures like Samuel Morse and Alan Turing; and Claude Shannon, the creator of information theory itself.\u00a0And then the information age arrives. Citizens of this world become experts willy-nilly: aficionados of bits and bytes. And we sometimes feel we are drowning, swept by a deluge of signs and signals, news and images, blogs and tweets. The Information is the story of how we got here and where we are heading.", "title": "The Information: A History, a Theory, a Flood", "url": "http://www.goodreads.com/book/show/8701960-the-information", "average": 3.99, "cover": "https://images.gr-assets.com/books/1348046486l/8701960.jpg", "reviews": 1231, "authors": [{"url": "https://www.goodreads.com/author/show/10401.James_Gleick", "name": "James Gleick"}, {"url": "https://www.goodreads.com/author/show/3135655.Claude_Shannon", "name": "Claude Shannon"}, {"url": "https://www.goodreads.com/author/show/14281846.John_J_Carty", "name": "John J.
