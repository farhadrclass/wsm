You drank the river dry. Why, Suttree, why must you be so? You are a bright boy and there is really no call for you to be hanging about with the lowest of the low. You could have made something of yourself. You came from a good family...well most of the family tree seems pretty solid.\"Mr. Suttree in what year did your greatuncle Jeffrey pass away?It was in 1884.Did he die by natural causes?No sir.And what were the circumstances surrounding his death.He was taking part in a public function when the platform gave way.Our information is that he was hanged for a homicide.Yessir.\"Every family has a few hiccups.You don't like your family much. You are in hiding not only from them, but a wife and a son you left behind. You make a haphazard living running a trot line. Selling fish for nickles and dimes don't put much comfort in the belly. You live on the river in an abandoned house boat. That boat might be fine in the summer time, but it sure got damned cold in the winter time didn't it sir? \n\"Ice lay along the shore, frangible plates skewed up and broken on the mud and the small icegardens whitely all down the drained and frozen flats where delicate crystal columns sprouted from the mire. He hauled forth is shriveled giblet and pissed a long and smoking piss into the river and spat and buttoned and went in again. He kicked the door shut and stood before the stove in a gesture of enormous exhortation. A frozen hermit. His lower jaw in a seizure.\"Your best friend, Gene Harrogate is a melonmounter. Yes, he stuck his dingus in a variety of citrullus vulgaris. They sent him to prison. What the hell else were they supposed to do with him? Once they found out in prison things got rough for the both of you didn't it Suttree? \"The crimes of the moonlight melonmounter followed him as crimes will.\" Yes sirree a prison bad ass put lumps on both your skulls. \nThe Patch where Harrogate fell in lust.Your other friend Billy Ray likes to beat up cops. He is barely recovered from one assault when he takes on another trio of cops. These aren't the right sorts of people to be friends with. You can't expect to live a long and healthy life surrounding yourself with people like this.Are you sad Suttree?You hook up with this pretty filly from Chicago. Wasn't her name Joyce? Yes, yes here it is in my notes... Joyce from Chicago. You really liked Joyce didn't ya? That woman knows her way around a penis. There was all together too much of her sitting there, the broad expanse of thigh cradled in the insubstantial stocking and garters with the pale flesh pursed and her full breasts and the sootblack piping of her eyelids, a gaudish rake of metaldust in prussian blue where cerulean moths had fluttered her wake from some outlandish dream. Suttree gradually going away in the sheer outrageous sentience of her. Their glasses clicked on the tabletop. Her hot spiced tongue fat in his mouth and her hands all over him liked the very witch of fuck.Unfortunately Joyce needs to keep plying her trade to keep you in clothes, toiletries, and living quarters. You are pretty cool about it, but the life of a whore starts to wear on her, and when she starts putting on weight then the real fireworks started. Yes indeed, one thing we know you are good at Suttree...yes we do...we know you are good at running. Are you sad Suttree? Is it soul sadness?It is no wonder you end up in the hospital with Typhoid Fever. You never eat right and you drink too much. You shiver and shake and suffer heat stroke. Your immune system is almost nonexistence. You almost checked out my friend. And now you have this writer...this Cormac McCarthy character from Knoxville who wrote a book about you. \nCormac McCarthyThe questions will just never end now. So what's next for Suttree? At the end of the book you are, supposedly, finally shaking the dust of Tennessee from your clothes. \"He was a man with no plans for going back the way he'd come nor telling any soul at all what he had seen.\" Too late Suttree, you are just too damn late.

The prose hit me with a whallop--so dense and driving, a slow-moving ineluctable train of words that carries the reader to dark and squalid and even funny places as we follow Cornelius Suttree, a privileged son who's given it all up to live as an outcast among outcasts.

There are a lot of words that I did not understand. Suttree by Cormac is a book that deserves, much like some of Malick's films. The pen of the big Mac is like a brush taking its time on the canvas, where a sentence would suffice to describe a flight of birds making crates. Here we are far from Kerouac and its small ballads on the road. Here is lost America. At the edge of Knoxville live the outcasts, the excluded voluntary or not of the system, there are whores, alcoholics, beggars, blind, black, white, it is fighting, it spells, it survives.From time to time there are chance meetings, nice cars, rotten rooms at $ 5 a week when the winter is too harsh and the river freezes, there are little coffee tricks, the cola watered with whiskey adulterated, the stove of the grocery around which is found this court of miracles.I could say again and again that this novel is rich, beautiful, superbly written.

Life\u2019s flow so drenched with death there\u2019s hardly need of another name for it; death as life\u2019s incorporated twin. It\u2019s all a river and it flows. Suttree is saturated with this outlook, this philosophy, though it remains unspoken, instead being simply shown, in a style itself all detail and turbid flow. In fact, the style itself is so integral to the book\u2019s texture and meaning, and the structure of it all so structureless (being modeled on riverflow as it is, words jostled by the very meaning they embody), that it reads almost as an experimental novel, by which I mean only that it is one extended exercise in verbal excessiveness that pushes the form\u2019s limits, and that there\u2019s something simply audacious about it, something almost Fuck off and let me write what the fuck I want about it. Suttree is one of the most engrossing and enriching novels I have ever read, a perfect melding of pure verbal texture and sensual detail culled from actual lived life. It reeks of authenticity. You almost have to scrape each page off your shoes as you flow and roam along with it. And yet the language is so weird at times! So language-centric and partially opaque that the reader\u2019s attention is drawn to the incredible verbal surface only to then discover the incredible human depths contained within unreachable by language. It satisfies the Joycean and the Bukowskian in all of us all stewed together. And while not exactly a moral or ethical guidebook, in that it never speaks its meaning or tries to teach, the humanity embodied by its verbal intricacy is example enough of open-heartedness and compassion for the wayward and down-and-out and downright tragic, for the mass of human dregs always with us, however unnoticed or ignored. But wedded to this open-heartedness and compassion is a detachment \u2013 again shown by the very body of the book rather than spoken, heightened by the very language, by the arcane and technical terms so abstract-seeming and detached from the scum and slithering earthiness of the book's depictions \u2013 that is a profound lesson in itself, as compassion is often assumed to be measured by how far one is willing to dangerously embroil one\u2019s self in another\u2019s suffering, and not by a heart that radiates outward from relative safety. Not that Cornelius Suttree lives in fear and thus in circumscribed safety, but he lives by his own unspoken code of equality and openness and self-preservation, and so his \u201csafety\u201d is like the safety of a self-sufficient pioneer \u2013 anything can happen at any time and he will be prepared for it and the adaptations required, until that one time he\u2019s not and he\u2019s either dead or lost. He understands that we are all alone and so must look out for ourselves, but he also understands that we are all the same and so must look out for each other, though in the end not another soul can save us, or really be there as a substantial presence in our individual unfathomable depths, or at our deaths. An impersonal fluctuating pain and joy-filled compound of profound aloneness and profound community tossed and dunked and driven and sucked up and spewed back out and sucked back in by life\u2019s recirculating turbid flow."}, {"userName": "Lori", "userReviewDate": "Nov 29, 2017", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/68050592-lori", "userReview": "This is my favorite Cormac McCarthy novel so far. It\u2019s a horrifying and funny ramble of the guy\u2019s life. I thought it had some really good vignettes, but a lot of the time I wasn\u2019t interested. I noticed most of the reviews are overwhelmingly positive. I\u2019m not so moved.There is really not much of a story. The dialogue in dialect is great. The poetic spill of words is incredible. You could draw a bath of them and soak, so long as you\u2019re not too fussy about the cigarette butts and used condoms bobbing around you. Or, your one of those people that enjoy complaining about the trash and debris in your travels.Aside from a character based on the Goat Man, Charles \"Ches\" McCartney, (1901?\u20131998), it did not especially remind me of home. Taken as a whole, I offer a heartfelt \u2018Thanks be to God\u2019 for the blessed mercy to me and mine. Maybe, I should have waited for a hell on earth story. I\u2019m already reading two books based in hell, well I suspect one\u2019s purgatory. No offense to any of the GR reviews, but I liked Jerome Charyn\u2019s 1979 review best.

Sources clearly indicate that Suttree was already a work in progress. Jerome Charyn reviewed Suttree for the New York Times and said that McCarthy actually wrote Suttree over a thirty year span. I wouldn't argue. It's just that good. It's just that perfect.Cornelius Suttree is the son of a wealthy and privileged family. He turns his back on an easy life style and becomes a regular roamer among the outcasts and misfits of Memphis Society in the McAnally Community down by the Tennessee River.\nMcAnally CommunitySuttree lives in a small shanty house boat below McAnally. \nIn the background stands the Gay Bridge, where Suttree views the recovery of a suicide at the beginning of the story.Suttree readily takes to the life of a river rat. He runs trotlines, selling the carp and catfish on his hooks at the market and other customers on his regular route through McAnally.\nRunning a trotlineAlthough Suttree is the central voice in the novel, Suttree is surrounded by a numerous crowd of characters reminiscent of Steinbeck's inhabitants of Cannery Row. The dialog is lean, each word ringing true.Suttree is a novel to be savored and read carefully. Time shifts throughout the novel. Flashbacks abound. Other action occurs in the present. A careful reading indicates that Suttree looks back on his past life in Knoxville, having moved on. However, Suttree is a novel that becomes a seamless read, endlessly engrossing, and completely fascinating.Knoxville and the river become as significant characters as the men and women who live in town and on the river. McCarthy's brings life on the river alive. You can hear it, smell it, feel it. Suttree is a constant puzzle. McCarthy never reveals the reason for his separation from his family. However, Suttree served time in a Tennessee Workhouse, a lesser security level of the Tennessee Penitentiary system for an attempted pharmacy robbery. Whether Suttree's family banished him, or Suttree chose to save his family's is never clearly revealed.Nor is Suttree a stranger to love. He was married and had a son. That he remembered his wife's hair, black, spread across the pillow, storm blown, after they had shared their marriage bed clearly indicate that he did not deliberately seek the life of a loner. Once again, his abandonment of his wife and child is left unclear.Reading Suttree is enough to make you believe Mark Twain has returned from the dead and written the later years of Huck Finn's life, unhindered by the social conventions that Twain pressed but did not cross excessively in his own life time.While many McCarthy readers and reviewers consistently point to Blood Meridian as his greatest work, I'll choose, Suttree. Highly recommended.

Samples I was able to quickly pull: \nWhere hunters and woodcutters once slept in their boots by the dying light of their thousand fires and went on, old teutonic forebears with eyes incandesced by the visionary light of a massive rapacity, wave on wave of the violent and the insane, their brains stoked with spoorless analogues of all that was, lean aryans with their abrogate Semitic chapbook reenacting the dramas and parable therein... ...Gray vines coiled leftward in this northern hemisphere, what winds them shapes the dogwhelk's shell. ... A dim world receded above his upturned toes, shapes of skewed shacks erupted bluely in the niggard lamplight. ... Dim scenes pooling in the summer night, wan ink wash of junks tilting against a paper sky, rorschach boatmen poling mutely over a mooncobbled sea. ... As he rocks in his rusty pannier to the sea's floor in a drifting stain of guano.... Bechrismed with scented oils he lay boneless in a cold euphoria.\n I wish I could be intelligent enough to understand, much less comprehend, all this on a quick read.Cabalistic, pleonastic and recondite issues aside ;-), this simply was not nearly as memorable or enjoyable as Blood Meridian, All the Pretty Horses and No Country for Old Men.*Modified Benjamin Disraeli's 1878 pan of Gladstone."}, {"userName": "Edward", "userReviewDate": "Nov 05, 2016", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/12933866-edward", "userReview": "No one in the world can write like McCarthy. The power of his sentences comes not from ease and lightness and polish - they are hard and angular like a sculpted figure whittled laboriously from a gnarled hunk of wood, rendered the more striking for the humble matter from which it was hewn. The prose is wild and inscrutable, awash with metaphor and arcane vocabulary and curiouslyformed compoundwords to confound the reader - the purpose seems to be to locate the limit of language and extract from it every available quantum of substance.There is no neat little story, no tidy character arc. Like all McCarthy's novels, Suttree is an attempt to make sense of the anguish and absurdity of a life lived within the crucible of an indifferent universe, where redemption is nonexistent and slow entropic decay is the natural order of things."}, {"userName": "Darwin8u", "userReviewDate": "Jul 23, 2011", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/2294090-darwin8u", "userReview": "It is amazing how McCarthy can find the lyrical beauty in an absurd gout of hallelucinationatory crazy. Absolutely one of my favorite novels of all time (nearly stripped McCarthy's Blood Meridian of its bloody title). Reads like Steinbeck wrote a play based on a David Lynch film about a nightmare child of Fellini and Faulkner that is now worshiped as scripture by pimps, prostitutes, grifters, fishmongers and of course fishermen. At times Suttree hits me like a complicated musical chorus, a surreal painting, and a ballet of misfits and grotesques, all chopped up and swirling in a dirty river's refuse.

Most of Mccarthy's other works are very plot-driven, and you see that really reinforced in his western novels where you have this incredibly hypnotic language coalescing with (often horrific) events to create this sort of magisterial whirlwind of doom which just pulls you in with it's richness. That sort of building up takes a back burner here in favor of something which just sort of flows out in all directions, trying to encompass totally the world of the downtrodden and dispossessed in and around Knoxville, circa, 1951. Mccarthy assembles this incredible rogues gallery of outcasts and we just sort of follow them around, watching them drink, fight, fuck, and in general just shyst their way through life. And yet we always return to Cornelius Suttree, an odd and supremely lonely man, as he stumbles through life, moving between these almost Huckleberry Finnesque moments of humor and surprising tenderness, and these really gothic moments of isolation and loss.Unlike say Blood Meridian or All the Pretty Horses, I found that this took a few days to really work its way into my head. But once it did, I actually kind of wanted the stunning descriptions of floating river trash and burnt out industrial parks to just keep going on. If you've ever felt degenerate, or shiftless or lonely, you'll probably find that Suttree resonates, albeit slowly."}, {"userName": "Lane Wilkinson", "userReviewDate": "Jan 05, 2008", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/366448-lane-wilkinson", "userReview": "'Suttree' goes directly into my own, personal daydream of the idealized 20th century canon. The heavily stylized prose hearkens back to the works of Joyce, Steinbeck, Algren, Faulkner, and Celine. Indeed, I have yet to encounter another book that so perfectly synthesizes these five unique voices of 20th century literature'Suttree', at heart, is a sort of urban pastoral, replete with the myriad voices of a depressed, post-war Knoxville. Cornelius Suttree's wanderings echo precisely the tourist-guide to Dublin that is found in 'Ulysses'. From the bottle-broken industry fields of the riverfront to the Dickensian squalor of McAnally Flats, every inch of pavement in downtown Knoxville is meticulously cataloged and populated with all manner of tramps, lowlifes, and assorted miscreants.This tour of the destitute is peppered with the strange vernacular of the streets, a sort of Southern-drawl meets drunken brusque. Dialogues rise and fall with a natural cadence that is absolutely mesmerizing. In particular, I was struck by the amazing brevity with which some events unfolded. Though many pages might be spent on arguably mundane details of fishing, socializing, or even decorating basement rentals (albeit, in beautiful prose), life-changing events such as the deaths of lovers, the deterioration of relationships, and the dire consequences of drunken brawls sometimes appear within the space of one or two paragraphs. Characters are killed and forgotten in a single sentence, which only adds to the narrative, insofar as Suttree, at heart, is a man who has given up. Love, death, and squalor make no impression on Suttree, and he becomes a sort of infinitely malleable and sadly detached figure. Where a night if drinking and screwing occupies twenty pages, the death of a friend in a barfight later that night only warrants a single paragraph. This sort of terse approach makes 'Suttree' read as a psychological survey of despondency. Yet, Suttree is admirable in his insouciance. His ineffable lack of concern for the crumbling world around him gives him a strength that is lacking in all of the other characters. It seems not so much that Suttree has given up on life, rather, he seems to have adopted the infinite resignation of some existential sage."}, {"userName": "Melki", "userReviewDate": "May 11, 2012", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/5293536-melki", "userReview": "A man spends a few years of his life living on the river; years that are filled with catfish and carp, sex and death, vile bodies, and viler bodily fluids.

And ended up loving the book again.[will make a better review than this, I promise]10:11 PM, 2/12/2017- in the middle of re-reading Blood Meridian. In that I almost forgot about the verbal and structural torrent of Suttree. Compared to the bloody masterpiece that has a more evident design of its own - even with chapter headings and short lists of what happens in each other - Suttree, with an \"order\" and a progress, has a more fluid one. The prose in both Suttree and Blood Meridian is extravagant, using the English language's abilities to include verbal and literary echoes from religion, literature, psychology, and nature. But Suttree has a wider view, almost Shakespearean and Dickensian (if not quite matching either Shakespeare's gift of deep characterization and personality or Dickens' vividness of caricature that extends to all), accommodating the whole underclass with a special compassion and a humor. And the sexual presence in Suttree is more evident and put to interesting and grotesque uses, whereas Blood Meridian, in its very masculine and muscular environment, seems to not include sex much, except in hints of rape and violence, violence which is BM's central concern and core.And of course, Cornelius Suttree, perhaps among the most characterized personage in McCarthy's universe, alongside Judge Holden. The kid does have some heroic presence, if Harold Bloom is to be believed, but it must be searched for, and the kid has no interiority and memory. Suttree is funny, shallow, deep, thoughtful, impulsive, and ultimately compassionate. I love him. Annoyed with him at times. Yet love him.If McCarthy had a single masterpiece, it would possibly be Blood Meridian.

Very dense.I really think this was the book where McCarthy transitioned from a very good writer to a great one. Not just because this was the last of his Appalachia books, you can also see where the writing changes to the signature style that sets him apart from other writers. The introduction is one example, as are the last 30 or so pages.I finished this on my iPhone at my nephew's high school district finals wrestling tournament (in my defense, it was 6 hours and he only wrestled twice, though won both times). I was immediately reminded of how a great work is interpreted by different people in different ways. I wanted to grab the microphone to see if any English teachers were present so I could hold a small group discussion. Since that was not possible, I read some essays on the book on my phone instead.No spoilers, but I generally disagreed with what I read. The key to my outlook on the book was in the last 30 pages. More importantly, certain interactions where the definitions of not often used words are critical. It's pure McCarthy in that unique word usage is a signature of his.Suttree was a very satisfying book; one that makes you ready to move straight to its follow-up, Blood Meridian, except this one is not violent at all (by McCarthy's standard)."}, {"userName": "Bill", "userReviewDate": "May 15, 2016", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/1811095-bill", "userReview": "So, I read this book because my Goodreads friend Cody is always raving about what a great book this is. And, he is right, it's a masterpiece. Every sentence is a thing of beauty, a work of art. And Suttree and Harrogate are two of the most memorable characters in fiction.The only quibble I have is that McCarthy likes to show off his extensive vocabulary. I had a pretty good education and have read thousands of books, so I think my vocabulary is better than average, but there were still quite a few words that I had never seen before, never mind knew what they meant. For example, in the space of two sentences, he uses the following words: fustic, morling and gimpen. I could give more examples, but you get the idea.

Most of it takes place on the waterfront of Knoxville, Tennessee, circa early 1950's. Suttree is a \"river rat\", living in a derelict houseboat and making his living as a fisherman, cavorting with down and out members of the Knoxville underworld. The difference between them and Suttree is that he was born into a privileged family and has chosen this life. We never find out why, and are only given a few hints of his previous life. What we do know is that he is smarter than his cronies, and they look to him for advice and help, which he gives even when he knows it will lead nowhere. That's it for plot, there really isn't one. This is a series of scenes and incidents, and some of the tales are masterpieces of humor. Gene Harrogate is possibly the stupidest man/boy in the annals of literature, and every scene with him promises laughs, inter-laced with sadness. McCarthy does that very well in this book: even as you're laughing, you can see the tragedy of these lives.Some reviewers see traces here of Huckleberry Finn and Steinbeck's cast of characters in \"Cannery Row\" and \"Tortilla Flats\". I saw that too, but can also see that Suttree contains traces of fictional characters who came later, namely Cool Hand Luke and Sully from the pages of Richard Russo's \"Nobody's Fool.\" The men who never fit in, but just want to live their own version of a good life. Lonely drifters that cause envy in the rest of us, because they dare to march to their own beat, and tell the rest of the world to go to Hell. I've been reading a lot of McCarthy lately, and this one is different. Violence, yes, inhumanity, yes, but humor and friendship and compassion in people who have little else.

Sorry to say, gentlemen, that I disagree with you on both counts (but we\u2019re still on for lifting, bros). As great as Meridian is, it pales to this White Male by several hectares to McCarthy\u2019s true masterpiece, Suttree. (I won\u2019t even address the second contention.)Don\u2019t let the pagination fool you. 471-pages isn\u2019t long by anyone\u2019s estimation, but McCarthy makes it seem at least twice its length (I mean this in a good way). The book is so goddamn languid, so redolent of the steady current of the the river at its center, that its miracles are revealed slowly, not in the spurting gore-fountains of McCarthy\u2019s more famous bloodfeasts. Cornelius \u201cBuddy\u201d Suttree is one of the most beautifully and prismatically-rendered characters of the last 50 years. You know this man, his not uncommon faults, and his essential sweetness. You may even, like me, love him in some not small way for the incorruptibility of his soul.I first came to McCarthy 22-years ago when he became assigned reading for friends in college. I was more than infatuated with his mastery of language at the time (how hard is it to impress a 16/17-year old?) It\u2019s been quite a few years since I\u2019d read anything by him, and even longer since I had touched his Tennessean novels. At this age, it\u2019s an odd dichotomy: half of his prose is painfully lovely, the other laugh-out-loud funny. Seriously. His word selection is so fucking ridiculously arcane that I can only assume that, as a young man, the \u2018Mac had to substitute a dictionary of natural biology for proper pornography when administering self-love. Plus, his idiosyncratic language\u2014which no one can ape, nor should they try\u2014has more contractions than a woman in the last throes of hard labor. (See angelclotted; butyljawed; approximately one-thousand other examples.)But all of this is starting to seem like I don\u2019t absolutely adore the novel. I do. It is work of staggering beauty; a masterpiece by any measure. This is the one McCarthy novel I\u2019d freely recommend to anyone, especially those who, like me, see life as a Homeric odyssey we can consider successful if the gorgon remains insatiate for at least one more day. Sure there are instances of McViolence and McMisery, but there is a beam of light as stunning as true innocence penetrating the obliquity that betrays Suttree\u2019s guileless core.

Comic misadventures and schemes a l\u00e1 Twain occur, passages of beat gutter poetry, stark imagery and characters out of medieval allegory or the Old Testament (Witches, fools, and madmen); makes for a strange but beautifully written book.

But I have read the first sentence, and here goes....It is marvellous. Somewhat as McCarthy, I'll refract and draw a few straight lines but first one way of seeing it whole. It's ethical, of course, and not moral, and the distinction between the two is immense in this book. An oddyssey of one man who is all souls in an underworld (literally most of the settings are beneath the city, under bridges, in transit as the rivers and creeks carry grotesque reminders of the respectable world; the normal world is not present at all. Suttree's divorce from his father was never of Freudian dimension but simply a repudiation of, and the vital distaste for contemporary collective values that protect the safe in an equity by which their suffering is dreamlike only like their lives). It's ethical because it has the old testament sounding prophetic questions and voice, the root boundaries of living and death, and the eternal question as to whether a man down with thieves and murderers and scum (etc.) can be good. And Suttree, who is all that is left of all that is left of what we have to hold on to, is a lovely guy. It's ethical because it is about suffering and sin (as in mistakes made to escape suffering), and like its generic cousins because it shows that a life is important, an individual is godly (inasmuch as any individual is godly, all are).Formally, it's very tight. A continuity of imagery and motif (not quantitavely but always in the background): most obvious is the reference to eyes, and from this to the cold lens of a camera and the complexities of represented histories (photographs) and the borderless space between the living and the dead; thence to representation generally, at one point a specific reference to a stage with pulleys and winches and wings, and here the city does get pictured - as a backdrop. Shifting representations, light used like a painter, for instance how the formless grey muggy quotidian city only becomes delineated at night by its contours of light. Roads, lines, patterns,shapes, described and commented upon as abstract concepts too. The 'mathematical certainty of death'. The brilliantly depicted, formed hallucinations of madness counterposed with helix and corridor, door and window, bricolage everywhere from some power to order.The way he handles time is tight too. So that, and this is probably the nearest I've come across a subjective valorisation of the experience of being in time, rather than any mimesis or spatialisation, it is compressed, condensed, displaced, segues a few months from one sentence to the next, and yet like a dream with all its weird workings nevertheless does set a limit around things so that at the end you think that yes you have been through some of Suttree's life.And it is very funny too!

I have nothing against McCarthy's more famous later novels. No Country for Old Men and the Road were both fine reads, stellar in places. But I'd have to place prime era Cormac back a few years. And while my favorite of his novels is still Blood Meridian, I'd put this at a close second.In terms of structure, this is a unique novel. It doesn't so much have a conventional plot that follows a series of events and shows how the characters react to these events. Instead, this tells the story of several years in the life of Cornelius Suttree. Suttree was born into a privileged family, but for reasons never fully explained, rejects this life of privilege and lives among the destitute and often violent residents of the Tennessee River. Not only is the cast of characters wonderfully realized (I found myself thinking of Suttree as \"Sut\" as the novel went on), but the setting becomes a character in and of itself, much like in Gibson's Neuromancer and the best two or three Pynchon books. A character defined by squalor and violence, I'll grant that, but a character just the same. It's pretty much a frontier town, just without the frontier.As you can see, Suttree is an ambitious novel, and not just because it's McCarthy's longest (although its 471 pages aren't that long). It also has the broadest emotional scope. As many have said before, Suttree is funny. You might not associate that word with Cormac, and rest assured that the laughs are a long ways from wacky. In fact, every single humorous episode here is painted some sort of shade of black. At minimum, it's grotesque, as with Suttree's friend Gene Harrigan, his get-rich-quick schemes, and his misadventures with melons. At maximum, you only laugh at Suttree to ease the tension. Because it's also a sad novel, one wrought with failed romances, sudden deaths, brutal winters, and fervish hallucinations. Yet there's also odd and unexpected hope in places. Watching Suttree himself rise above the squalor around him by virtue of sheer cussedness of spirit is uplifting in a peculiar way.Like most McCarthy novels, there's not a word out of place here. But the prose is less bare than his other novels. And while the barer prose style fits the content of the Road and No Country, it cannot be forgotten that McCarthy has a gift for crafting beautiful language. It makes for a fascinating contrast to the often strangely hilarious horrors that surround our hero, and it's stuff to lose yourself in. The guy understands the power of finding the perfect word and the most imaginative metaphor. As far as I'm concerned, those are worth a dozen flowery adjectives and adverbs as far as sensory language is concerned.There are a few caveats here, but they have nothing to do with the novel and everything to do with the reader. Since this is a McCarthy novel, you have to have a stomach for violence. You also have to not mind that the guy's outlook on life is decidedly less than rosy. But if you're up for that, you'll find Suttree is a rich, beautifully written, and funny novel. Maybe not the place to start with McCarthy, but definitely a fine next step if you've read his more accessible novels and are hungry for more."}, {"userName": "Teresa Proen\u00e7a", "userReviewDate": "Jul 09, 2014", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/6923777-teresa-proen-a", "userReview": "\"\u00c0s vezes n\u00e3o percebo para que \u00e9 que servem as vidas das pessoas.\"Suttree n\u00e3o \u00e9 um romance para quem gosta de \"despachar\" p\u00e1ginas.
