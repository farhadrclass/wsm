There is so much emotion in this book that you can't help but feel it in the depths of your soul. Perhaps it's that the story has so much to do with children and the tragic demise of young Nate, or perhaps it's simply the spiritual elements that have just the right amount of religious undertones to truly make you think... and wonder. What happens to little Nate makes you feel a mixture of hurt, sadness, and anger at a whole new kind of prejudice that a lot of us likely never even knew existed. But, the part that brings the wonder is watching his story in \"Under-Heaven\" develop alongside that of another young boy named Jesse.By the time you get to the end you won't believe the connection the two share and as much as you try to figure it out you never will. I loved this novel and urge you to read it. It's a beautifully written story with a cinematic quality you can see play out perfectly in your mind's-eye. Frustrations will form as you try hard to figure out what the two stories have in common, but it's the good kind of frustration that keeps you riveted to the book until the very end. I give it 5 Ravens!Kitty Bullard / Great Minds Think Aloud / http://www.greatmindsliterarycommunit...Read more: http://www.greatmindsthinkaloud.probo..."}, {"userName": "Mistress of the Dark Path", "userReviewDate": "Mar 03, 2013", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/18009098-mistress-of-the-dark-path", "userReview": "\"Under-Heaven\" follows the paths of two boys' lives. You first meet Jesse, a five-year-old boy who lives in Boston with his mother. He comes from a troubled home and his parents have split up recently. This isn't easy on him as he has fond memories of the three of them as a family. Unfortunately, his father has become a drunk and drug addict which has caused a lot of problems. Jesse wants his parents to reconcile, as he loves his father a lot and misses him, but also knows his mother can't handle his dad under the current circumstances. In the boy's young mind, he doesn't understand why things have changed so much and he is willing to try anything to fix them. Unfortunately, it may be a task too great for his small shoulders to handle alone.The other boy, Nate, also has a strong presence in the novel. He died at the age of nine in the 1940s and went to a place called \"Under-Heaven\". This isn't necessarily a bad place, more of a transition point for most souls. Yet Nate can't resolve the tragedy that happened in his past life to move on. For awhile, he can't even allow himself to remember it, but knows that unlocking the mystery behind his death is key to knowing what step he must take next in his afterlife. It is not something he is capable of for a long time, though, and the novel follows his experiences in \"Under-heaven\" and the other souls and angels he meets there who try to help him.I must say this book was difficult for me in the beginning. It starts in a dark place for both boys and felt rather depressing. The multiple points of view also caused me some trouble until I got into the flow of the story, but I stuck with it believing it would get better. As it turned out, I was right. Somewhere around the fifteen percent mark, the novel picked up speed and the suspense became intense. I found myself getting attached to both boys and needing to know what would happen to them. They came alive for me and I knew at some point the author would entwine their stories together, despite the time difference. How exactly this happens, I won't say, but it wasn't in the way I anticipated. The depth of the novel is far greater than one can even predict.For those considering this book, I would say that if you are like me, it may be tough to get through at first. Do not let that deter you, because the story progresses and once you reach a certain point, it will be nearly impossible to put down. So many unexpected events happen and you meet some very interesting characters in addition to the main two boys. The way the author gets inside these kids heads is amazing and you will feel like you are right there with them, suffering through the hard times and smiling through the good. When the conclusion came, I found myself misty eyed as all the pieces came together, even parts I hadn't considered as significant.If you are interested in alternative versions of the afterlife and enjoy stories where something good comes from tragedy, this is the perfect story to read. \"Under-Heaven\" will touch you in ways you cannot even imagine and bring a whole new perspective to how you view the world. I certainly enjoyed it and plan to read the novel again!"}, {"userName": "EZRead eBookstore", "userReviewDate": "Feb 01, 2012", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/3680893-ezread-ebookstore", "userReview": "(see the short video review here: http://vimeo.com/37327577)Where do we go when we die? What happens to our souls when our bodies are no more? Are we better off dead or alive? These are questions that many people ponder throughout their lives, and ones that Nate continues to ponder even in Under-Heaven. Aside from poking the readers\u2019 brains with philosophical questions, the tragic stories of both Nate and Jess will tug on your heart strings like a fiddler playing a solo.This uncertainty and confusion that Nate feels is easily related to, leaving readers, like myself, clutching my chest at the thought of a young boy dying so viciously and meaninglessly; or, watching poor Jess get his hopes up on his drug-addicted father. If fingernail marks aren\u2019t left on your breast, then you have a heart that\u2019s harder than steel.An interesting dynamic about pondering the after-life is dealing with the joy of reuniting with old family and friends while trying to accept the absence of those left on earth. While Nate may have left his dangerous life in death, his sister continues a perilous life on earth. Such a situation begs the question: Is it better to have lived, or to have died?While most situations and decisions are not black and white, it seems that even in Under-Heaven, there are most certainly grey areas, as well as red, blue, yellow, black, green, etc. Watching Nate\u2019s uncle from Hell be a likeable character is both disturbing and amusing. Likewise, seeing a caring boy in Under-Heaven who could dangerously be snatched by demons is vexing. Judging the good and the bad isn\u2019t so easy, even in the afterlife.Though there isn\u2019t much laughter or smiles, there is a form of peace in this story. Like walking the edge of a cliff that provides a breathtaking view, this book is both scary and beautiful. Prepare to gasp on fears and choke back tears; this novel pulls out all the stops and pays no heed to speed bumps.- EZRead Staffer, Amelia"}, {"userName": "Marla Blowers", "userReviewDate": "Oct 07, 2011", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/6188632-marla-blowers", "userReview": "I'm sure we have all wondered at one time or another where our souls go when we die. \u201cUnder Heaven\u201d is a suspenseful novel that puts a twist on the traditional theory.

I knew I was going to be in for a very interesting read, but sweet Jesus! From page one, this book grabbed me by the throat and didn\u2019t let up until the end. Like others have said, because it is true, I really can\u2019t believe this is only $1. The mystery surrounding this book is so overwhelming; I guarantee that even though this book is intense, it will leave a smile on your face. Under-Heaven is two stories in one. One story is about a boy named Nate who has been killed. He doesn\u2019t go immediately to Heaven; however, he is in a place called Under-Heaven. It is where souls go that still have close ties to Earth and if their conscious overtakes them, they could still be taken to Hell. Nate can\u2019t remember what happened to him, but he knows it was bad. He learns that things are not as black and white as they may seem and we follow him as he struggles in the afterlife. Read the synopsis, it does this best. The other story is about another boy named Jesse. He has a mom and a dad. Dad has a big problem and his mother wants nothing to do with him. We see how Jesse struggles with wanting a father, but Jesse is scared for him and for those he hangs around. This is another book I will have to tread very carefully with. Any small thing I say could spoil this and I can\u2019t do that to you guys. Trust me, it will knock you out of your seat. I loved our main characters. I am not use to reading books where the points of view are from an 9 and 10 year old. We see how they have to struggle with hardship and have to take on adult roles for the sake of the ones they love. Nate had to for the sake of his baby sister, Vicky. After what happened to him and his family, Vicky grows up and is heading down a horrible path. Also all the other people (dead relatives) he meets in Under-Heaven that makes a huge impression on him and bring so many personalities to this book. Jesse is the man of the house because his father can\u2019t grow up and be a man. There are times when Jesse has to become the parent for his dad\u2019s sake. This story was so beautifully told and well written. I had a connection with all the characters because each brought a certain emotion to the story and it really drives this book into intense and scary places. Again, I won\u2019t spoil this, but the real focus is watching how these boys struggle with the situations that have been forced on them. What can they do to get out of their predicaments? Can they help those they love? Can they keep their family together? Following them on their intense journeys and watching them trying to make adult decisions, really adds something extra special to this book and was very thrilling to see. You really have to check this book out. Like I said, it was very intense. If you are a parent, I think it might strike an extra chord with you. It is sad, scary, and sweet all at once. I don\u2019t really have any complaints except for one character that we are introduced to, Mary-Lou Evans. She was the very definition of a psychopath and I really would have liked to have known what happened to her. She really opens Nate\u2019s eyes to what is real evil and I just want to know where she went. Hope it is where she deserves to be. This book does talk a lot about Heaven and Hell, but it isn\u2019t preachy. Even if you aren\u2019t a religious person, you will love this book. It truly puts a little spin on things we have heard and it just makes it that much more refreshing. Highly recommended!"}, {"userName": "Doris", "userReviewDate": "Jul 15, 2012", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/9449826-doris", "userReview": "In a message from the author, found on Amazon.com, Tim Greaton explains how he had a difficult, no, horrible childhood. Rather than wallow in despair, the young Tim found escape in his local library and books. Many of us found solace, friendship and safety in books.Now Tim writes books in the hopes of passing on to others, the moments of escape books gave him as a child.In Under Heaven, Tim gives us two stories twinned together like strands of DNA, not to be absorbed separately, but rather as a whole. Two boys, both are in painful circumstances, seemingly without hope or beauty; although each experiences love, which ultimately is the hope and beauty in their lives.Nine year old Nate is brutally murdered along with his parents, in retribution for being \"not one of us\". His beloved dog, Whiskey, saves Nate's baby sister, Vicky. Good thing, too, because watching Vicky becomes Nate's anchor, his reason to continue existing when he finds himself in Under Heaven, a kind of waiting room for Heaven. Souls come and go in Under Heaven, but Nate is frozen in place, wanting more love, but fearing more pain.Five year old Jesse is alive. Alive in a world that seems determined to change that. He both loves and fears his father, wanting to go forward, yet stepping back in fear.Jesse's dilemma appears to echo Nate's in Under Heaven. Just where the echoes link them, however, is found in the end where the unravelled strands of the DNA of the story are woven tightly together in a profound and satisfying way.Tim Greaton's book Under Heaven is a dark, scary moving tale with dollops of love and angels abound. Not only did Tim succeed in his chosen path to provide escape for others in books, he makes the reader want more of his brand of fiction."}, {"userName": "Jeff Dawson", "userReviewDate": "Aug 11, 2012", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/5163904-jeff-dawson", "userReview": "Worlds CollideThis is the third book from Mr. Greaton I chose to read. How does it compare to the first two? Completely different-in a good way. Of all the books I've read and reviewed over the past few years, this one falls into its own category-of which I'm still trying to place. This book reminds me of a fine Cuban cigar, perhaps a glass of Dom Perigion or a well aged Brandy. Each are to be savored and enjoyed, not rapidly consumed waiting for a refill. Relax and enjoy the moment.The story starts out a little slow with two diverging story lines. I went back several times to make sure I was reading the same story. I thought maybe a chapter or two were inadvertently snuck in. Patience. The two stories are paralleling an unseen time line. The lives of two boys Nathaniel (who was murdered and caught in under-heaven, a sort of weigh station between Heaven and Hell) and Jesse, who is very much alive (hoping his parents reunite) are going to collide in a most unusual way. I was twenty-four chapters into the read and still had no idea where the story was going. For some, that can be frustrating, Refer back to how I described this read. It's not a six pack of Miller-Lite or a Pack of Marlborro Light 100's that the users frequently can't get enough of. This is a story for savoring and reflecting. Believe me, there is so much extra activity surrounding these two boys, one will need to regroup and reflect before moving forward. Enjoy the moment, then move forward. with caution.In the end you will be shaking your head in stunned silence and asking the question, \"No way!\" I know I was.

Mr. Greaton has introduced a unique and interesting theory on what happens after our soul leaves the body. I thoroughly enjoyed reading what is a new take (for me) on this often thought of experience.I must admit while reading about Nate's living experiences, as well as the horrific events of the end of his life and his family's lives, I found it almost too painful to continue. My heart broke for these characters both for their every day life's experiences and their tragic passing. Through Mr. Greaton's writing the reader experiences such vivid emotion. I found myself gasping at the actions of some of the characters as well as wanting to reach through my Kindle and wrap my arms around those suffering such great pain. This book will bring tears to your eyes and at times a smile to your lips.I don't want to give too much away about Under-Heaven, the place that Nate found himself in for decades after his death, because I was enchanted and at times disturbed by this place. I want the reader to experience it firsthand as I did.UNDER-HEAVEN by TIM GREATON is a must read novel.

It is essentially three stories cleverly inter-related. The story focuses on two young boys, Nate and Jesse whose stories seem completely unrelated even though as a reader you know they must be. The story line eventually leads you to this connection pretty cleverly and in a way which is very hard to see coming.I'm not sure how to categorize this book. At first I thought it was religious fiction but ultimately I would call it a fantasy with many spiritual overtones and borrowing heavily from christian beliefs regarding life after death and mixing in a little reincarnation. It's a pretty unique mixture and I found it interesting and thought provoking.The book is a tear-jerker and not my usual type of reading but I must say I enjoyed it very much.

But where does he go from here? Five year old Jesse just wants his family back together. How can he halt his father's descent into self-destruction? In Under-Heaven we follow these two young souls as they struggle to understand and deal with dilemmas That would test the very best of us.This is story telling on an epic scale. It is a deeply moving tale that explores some of the most profound aspects of our world, life, death, love, loss and the very nature of existence. All of this is done in an entertaining and engaging way.Most of the story is told from the perspective of young Nate and Jesse who, perhaps, represent the children in all of us. This point of view ensures that the weighty issues considered here are accessible to all readers, in much the same way that Sophie's World by Jostein Gaarder was able to make Philosophy more accessible.The skilfully described scenes give Under-Heaven a realism that it may have lacked in the hands of a less talented writer. Similarly, the earth bound scenes and characters are very well drawn. This means that the whole story keeps its feet firmly planted in the reality of everyday life. A reality we can all relate to. The murder mystery elements of the story are equally well constructed. This allows the narrative to cross genre boundaries without detracting from the central themes of the story. The important characters were all well-defined, having both depth and multi-dimensionality.I did feel that a couple of the threads were a little confused. It was as if the author had decided that those ideas may be better examined in another story. This, however, merely altered the rhythm of the piece for a time. Ultimately, this was a well constructed, moving and thought provoking story.

In the epic and powerful \"Under-Heaven\" he has done it again...times three.Traumatized by the violent murders of his parents and himself, nine-year-old Nate wakes in a version of Purgatory. With the help of dead relatives from above and below, he struggles to find a way to move on. Meanwhile back on Earth, Nate's sole surviving sister seems to have been imprinted with darkness because time and again she finds herself involved with violent men and dangerous situations. When mobsters follow her and her latest boyfriend down a dead end dirt road, it doesn't seem likely that anyone will escape. The final player in this emotional opus is five-year-old Jesse who places his hope and faith in his drug-addicted father. It isn't until his kidnapping from his Boston school that the pain really begins. Tim Greaton's \"Under Heaven\" will pull you out of your world and leave you gasping for breath in his, and the surprising culmination of this entwining story will stay with you for a lifetime. One reviewer says, \"Like walking the edge of a cliff that provides a breathtaking view, this book is both scary and beautiful.\" While another reviewer declares, \"Tim Greaton's fans will follow him to Hell in gasoline raincoats....\"You're invited to find out why.From the Author:Dear Reader,By now, many of you are aware that I had a pretty horrible childhood. For me,there aren't a lot of cheerful memories, and dredging up what few I have is likerevisiting a graveyard. I was a somber kid and my childhood was something Isurvived not something I enjoyed. I don't blame my parents. They loved all oftheir children, but they themselves came from dysfunctional homes and were nomore qualified to raise six children than I am to perform brain surgery. Myparents did their best but their best was a disaster. No child should everexperience what I or, worse, what the two boys in this novel endured.Unfortunately, such tragedies occur every day. In my case, if it weren'tfor a local library and the books that allowed me brief periods of escape duringthose dark years, I'm not sure where I would be today. It is certain, however,that I owe a great debt to the librarians and those many authors who toiled forme. If my novels can help even one similarly troubled soul find a few moments ofescape, then I will have succeeded. Thank you for considering\"Under-Heaven.\" I'm humbled by the time you've already invested and am hopefulthat Nate and Jesse's emotional journeys will lead you to a brighter place inthe real world.
