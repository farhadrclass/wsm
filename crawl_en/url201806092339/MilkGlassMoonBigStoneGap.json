Now with that said, I love this Big Moon Gap series. It is a family saga, facing all the challenges and crisis of a middle aged marriage, close intercultural flavor, trying to raise a family, with all the interference that society can throw at it. Change, growth and even romance sends this story along on such a human and realistic path that you cannot help but cheer on its small home-town inhabitants. This episode covered Etta, Ave Maria and Jack MacChesney's daughter, from her preteens years to the start of her young adult life. Surprises abound. With this series being the only books I have read by Trigiani, I can honestly say that I am enamored by her writing. This series of books, the audios of which she narrators herself, amazed me. She did not come across as the unreachable International celebrity that I expected. She comes across as the comfortable, responsible, friendly neighbor that any of us would like to live next door to. This series will not be the last I read of Trigiani."}, {"userName": "Ladyslott", "userReviewDate": "Aug 01, 2010", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/3475302-ladyslott", "userReview": "The third book in the Big Stone Gap series. While I really enjoyed the first two books in this series, Big Stone Gap and Big Cherry Holler, I found this one to be just okay, a little better than average.The main character of this book is Ave Maria Mulligan MacChesney. In the first two books I really loved her character and her choices in life. This time I wanted to shake her more than once. Instead of the strong character from the first two books she seemed whiney and even shrewish at times, especially within her relationship to her teenaged daughter. I also felt he book seemed rushed, going through years with the turn of a page.That said I still enjoy the eccentric characters, and the beautiful descriptions, especially of Italy. And I love Jack Mac, Ave's true blue husband; even though I think his appearances here were mostly to calm down Ave after one of her outbursts.Not as good as the first two, but still gets extra points for bringing me on another trip to Big Stone Gap, which probably won't happen again, as it appears as if there is another book in the series it will be centered elsewhere."}, {"userName": "Cranky", "userReviewDate": "Sep 03, 2007", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/340555-cranky", "userReview": "I read the first two in this series and liked them, but by book #3 is was sick of this character (Ave Maria) and her emotional crises.

Although I had enjoyed the first book in the series titled Big Stone Gap, I did not enjoy the 2nd book in the series as much. However, this novel was back at the same enjoyment level for me as the 1st book. I love the characters, Fleeta, the stereotypical redneck Southern woman, Iva Lou, the woman who loved men but had finally found true love with her husband, Lyle, Etta MacChesney, headstrong daughter of Ave Maria Mulligan MacChesney, Jack MacChesney, a good man who stays true to Ave Maria through all their difficulties, and, of course, Ave Maria Mulligan MacChesney, the main character of the book. In this book, the reader watches Ave Maria, Jac and Etta go through the challenges of raising a daughter through her teenage years. Once again, Ave Maria and Etta return to Italy this time accompanied by husband Jack, where they spend time with Ave Maria's family and Etta renews her relationship with a young Italian man she had met their first trip to Italy. As always, Trigiani has done an outstanding job in portraying the language and lifestyle of a small town in the Appalachian mountains."}, {"userName": "Donna", "userReviewDate": "Aug 15, 2015", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/13244359-donna", "userReview": "This was pretty much 3 stars....but I appreciated the ending so I am rounding up. I haven't read the other books in this series so I have nothing to compare it to.I did the audio on this and the author did her own narration. I am not a fan of this at all. The author in this case wasn't completely awful, but she clearly can NOT do voices. It was hard sometimes to follow along on who was talking. She did try to place a noticeable pause between the different people when doing dialog, so that helped. But this could have been so much better if a professional had done this.This was about a family, their extended family and their small community. They were following the rhythm of life dealing with the ups and downs. I liked that it covered a lot of different things. I guess I appreciated the 'down to earth' sense this carried. I think this is always a good reminder for me when I get too caught up in problems...because it usually is small stuff not worth the lather."}, {"userName": "Caroline", "userReviewDate": "Jun 18, 2012", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/4416769-caroline", "userReview": "As always, Trigiani did not disappoint. As much as I disliked Jack Mac in Big Cherry Holler, I grew to love him that much more in Milk Glass Moon. Finally Ave Maria lightened up a little and I didn't find myself being angry with her reactions to the ever present life challenges. I laughed, I cried, I couldn't put it down. It seems that all too often with book series, the author runs out of ideas or just can't quite live up to the first book; Trigiani and the Big Stone Gap series is not in that category. So far I think Milk Glass Moon might be my favorite of the series, but each book has been just as good as the first. I cannot wait to start the final book, but at the same time, I do not want to leave all the characters and Big Stone Gap behind."}, {"userName": "Rick Parsons", "userReviewDate": "Sep 21, 2016", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/43960731-rick-parsons", "userReview": "The 3rd of 4 in a series, and I think the best so far.

It was the summer of 2000 and we had just moved back to Lincoln after living in Fort Worth, Texas for a few years. There\u2019s a lot about that particular summer that I remember quite vividly, but it\u2019s funny how memory eludes us. I would\u2019ve sworn that I loved Big Stone Gap\u2014so much so that I almost re-read the book before I started in on the second in the series\u2014but as I look back through my reading journal for that year, I see that I only gave it a \u201cGood\u201d rating. Apparently, I had a tough time getting interested, but after a few chapters, I was hooked. But still, only an average rating? Had I remembered this, I wonder if I would\u2019ve bothered to continue with this series. Nonetheless, in an effort to start reading more from my shelves, I decided to try the sequel (Big Cherry Holler), but couldn\u2019t get interested and set it aside. I wasn\u2019t planning to continue with any more books from the series, but changed my mind after reading a few comments by readers who mentioned they liked Milk Glass Moon better than the second book. It turns out I did, too. I found it to be a bit reminiscent of Jan Karon\u2019s Mitford series, at least with regard to the setting (in the Blue Ridge Mountains) and the large cast of characters that make up the close-knit community. I also enjoyed reading the passages focusing on the relationship between Ave Maria and her only child, Etta, and found that the dialogue between the two rang true, especially to this mother of an only daughter.Final Thoughts: I was pleasantly surprised that I liked Milk Glass Moon as well as I did, especially after giving up on the second novel. I was also surprised to learn that it isn\u2019t the final installment in a trilogy, but that there\u2019s a fourth, entitled Home to Big Stone Gap. I don\u2019t own a copy, but maybe I\u2019ll see if it\u2019s available on audio through my library."}, {"userName": "Cindy", "userReviewDate": "Jun 13, 2013", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/7019761-cindy", "userReview": "I have enjoyed this series for a variety of reasons - I guess the first being that I can identify with the main character, Ave Maria - she is a pharmacist in a Southern town (although I live in a much bigger town than Ave) and she lost her younger child to cancer. The characters are finely drawn and they have become like old friends - Fleeta, Iva Lou, Spec, and the rest. This is the final part of the trilogy and it deals with the changes that Ave and her daughter Etta face as Etta grows up. Jack Mac is a calming influence over both of their personalities. There are surprises along the way and these characters grow and learn. A sweet novel to be savored on a warm Southern evening.Quotes to remember:\"How easy it is to get lost in the noise of this world, to find yourself leading a life of acceptance and resignation...Is there anything new ahead of me, or is this it? Being a wife, a mother, a pharmacist?\"\" 'Because you see the girl in me.' It's true. Nobody remembers her anymore. She got lost on the road of responsibility and within the natural process of aging (ick). When Pete Rutledge tells me I'm beautiful, I believe him. And boy, do I need to hear it. I need to know it...I'm not just a pharmacist or a wife or a mother. I'm me, the real me. I'm celebrated.\"\"This is the best moment to be a parent, when you see that your child is going to surpass you, that her curiosity will take her place and teach her things that you never even thought about.\"\"Having children makes a woman mark time in a different way.\"\"A long time ago I went to a fortune-teller, and she told me that when you have a dream come true, you must then redream. You must not stay in the past. Because all of life changes anyway, and if you try to hang on to happiness or success or even the people in your life, you will be unhappy. You have to set new goals.\"~~ can you tell I liked this novel?~~"}, {"userName": "Susan", "userReviewDate": "Mar 22, 2010", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/3475228-susan", "userReview": "I originally read this book for my Book Club, not realizing it was the third in a series of four books. Milk Glass Moon made way more sense now that I have read the first two books and then re-reading this one. However, I would rate Milk Glass Moon the same as before. So far, I enjoyed the second book (Big Cherry Holler) better than this one and the first one (Big Stone Gap). In Big Cherry Holler, the characters had more dimension. Ave Maria had to come to terms with the loss of her son, her daughter growing up, her husband pulling away from her, the temptation of an affair, and all of it coming back to reality when Ave Maria\u2019s friend Theodore tells her in his own way to \u201csnap out of it!\u201d and get your life back together girl! In this book, Ave Maria is wishy washy \u2013 not her true self of misguided confidence. She never really comes to terms with her daughter, Etta, growing up and becoming her own person. Ave Maria does not embrace this independence but tries to stifle it (persuading her to go to her college). All this controlling, dependent personality does not make sense when Ave Maria has been portrayed as an independent woman in the first two books. This behavior does not really seem in character. I chuckled a couple of times in Big Cherry Holler with Theodore \u2013 whom I just love as a character. But his role was minimal at best in this book, and therefore I was disappointed. Pete and Jack were status quo with nothing really exciting going on \u2013 maybe a marriage\u2026 but even that fizzled. So three stars is generous for this installment."}, {"userName": "Lisa", "userReviewDate": "Mar 09, 2009", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/1049530-lisa", "userReview": "Unbeknownst to me, i read book 4 first...then when i realized that, i started with book one, and then continued on. This is book three, and probably my favorite of the whole series. (of course, it could be because i have grown so fond of all the characters by now that i really enjoyed the story, and conclusion).The lead character, Ave Maria, can be a bit annoying, which made the series hard to read sometimes...but in this book, her \"annoying\" character comes to the realization that she is a pain in the ass, and that perhaps she should lighten up a bit.(of course, its not until the end that she realizes this) :)Her friends and family all know her to be this kind of person, and tease her a bit about it in this book, which to me, was sweet justice to her character. When you are reading and thinking, \"enough already...put on your big girl panties and deal with it\"...the other characters basically tell her that for you :)A lot of things happen to many of the characters in this book too...sad, happy, interesting, fun....and she covers a lot of years in this book, as well as answering some questions about the folks we've come to love.

I think it has something to do with the fact that I enjoyed reading about Ave's depth of thinking...that sometimes works for her, and sometimes works against her. Yet, she has so many men and women in her life that help her to get beyond it (in this book, her daughter gets added to that list).The timing in this story, of raising her daughter from age 10-18 was somehow not as appealing as some of the others, yet, an integral part of what gets Ave through these years is her continued love story with her husband Jack, a man that stood by her in so many beautiful, immeasurable ways; he held her together through difficulty, adored her very being, fathered her daughter in the most understanding, effective ways.There are so many quotes that I flagged from this book.

Nobody gets into the heads, hearts, and flaws of her still-lovable characters like Trigiani. Granted, Etta is a bore, but bores exist in real life. I am so glad she wrote a fourth book, which I can't wait to read. I guess I don't want a fifth one, if she decides to write it, since the characters are just a bit older than me, and if she writes another book, it would probably be to kill off Jack Mac or one of my other favorites, and I am losing too many old friends in my real life as it is.

There were also some travels to Italy as there are in many of Trigiani's books. What I missed was the Italian flair and family. One of the big themes was Ave and her daughter Etta's relationship during her teens (13-18).

With twists as plentiful as those found on the holler roads of southwest Virginia, this story takes turns that will surprise and enthrall the reader.Transporting us from Ave Maria's home in the Blue Ridge Mountains to the Italian Alps, from New York City to the Tuscan countryside, Milk Glass Moon is the story of a shifting mother-daughter relationship, of a daughter's first love and a mother's heartbreak, of an enduring marriage that contains its own ongoing challenges, and of a community faced with seismic change.All of Trigiani's beloved characters are back: Jack Mac, Ave Maria's true love, who is willing to gamble security for the unknown; her best friend and confidant, bandleader Theodore Tip-ton, who begins a new life in New York City; librarian and sexpert Iva Lou Wade Makin, who faces a life-or-death crisis. Meanwhile, surprises emerge in the blossoming of crusty cashier Fleeta Mullins, the maturing of mountain girl turned savvy businesswoman Pearl Grimes, and the return of Pete Rutledge, the handsome stranger who turned Ave Maria's world upside down in Big Cherry Holler. In this rollicking hayride of upheaval and change, Ave Maria is led to places she never dreamed she would go, and to people who enter her life and rock its foundation. As Ave Maria reaches into the past to find answers to the present, readers will stay with her every step of the way, rooting for the onetime town spinster who embraced love and made a family. Milk Glass Moon is about the power of love and its abiding truth, and captures Trigiani at her most lyrical and heartfelt.From the Hardcover edition.", "title": "Milk Glass Moon\n      \n          (Big Stone Gap #3)", "url": "http://www.goodreads.com/book/show/105696.Milk_Glass_Moon", "average": 3.95, "cover": "https://images.gr-assets.com/books/1347435926l/105696.jpg", "reviews": 566, "authors": [{"url": "https://www.goodreads.com/author/show/9219.Adriana_Trigiani", "name": "Adriana Trigiani"}], "type": ["Fiction", "Womens Fiction", "Romance"], "outlinks": ["http://www.goodreads.com/book/show/105696.Milk_Glass_Moon", "http://www.goodreads.com/book/show/772327.Milk_Glass_Moon", "http://www.goodreads.com/book/show/13133644-milk-glass-moon", "http://www.goodreads.com/book/show/545143.Milk_Glass_Moon", "http://www.goodreads.com/book/show/58820.Milk_Glass_Moon", "http://www.goodreads.com/book/show/17979657-milk-glass-moon", "http://www.goodreads.com/book/show/6061176-milk-glass-moon", "http://www.goodreads.com/book/show/13127599-the-shoemaker-s-wife", "http://www.goodreads.com/book/show/58822.Big_Stone_Gap", "http://www.goodreads.com/book/show/52471.Big_Cherry_Holler", "http://www.goodreads.com/book/show/60057.Lucia_Lucia", "http://www.goodreads.com/book/show/3673357-very-valentine"]}
