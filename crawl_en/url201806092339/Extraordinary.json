I mean, they all start pretty well (don\u2019t they?), but rare are books aimed for a young audience that keep my interest from dwindling.Extraordinary was the perfect read to lift me up of my sudden book slump. I didn\u2019t even know it was there before I realized how I kept starting book after book without finishing any one of them. But this story was so charming and filled with beautiful themes that \u2013 even with the subject of sickness incorporated \u2013 it was a real pleasure to spend my afternoons turning its pages.Pansy\u2019s goal consisting in her changing into a better person to make her ill best friend, Anna, proud was lovely to see. There were moments that made me sad\u2026 especially when Pansy had remembrances of happy moments between her and Anna, but they were there, mostly, so we could see what a great bond they shared!What would have made this book better is a share of chapters between Pansy and Andy. After all, he was Anna\u2019s brother and a character almost as important as Pansy, in my opinion. That would definitely have made things clearer too since it was obvious that Andy had a lot of things to deal with, reflect on inside\u2026 It could have been interesting to have some of HIS memories with his sister as well.I would have liked less repetition concerning the settings, too. Pansy\u2019s teacher, for sure, sounded original and actually kind of amazing (she was young-ish, energetic and had all of these fun ideas of activities), but even her classroom eventually got mundane.Recommended story for all fans of realistic/contemporary middle grade books with highly developed friendships out there!"}, {"userName": "Tonyalee", "userReviewDate": "Apr 29, 2016", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/4378324-tonyalee", "userReview": "Why did I pick it up?I was asked to review and feature Extraordinary for its one year book birthday! I was actually looking for a contemporary middle grade and loved the sound of Extraordinary.What's it about?Extraordinary is the story about a girl looking for fulfill her promises to her best friend, and to become Extraordinary. After having a fight with her best friend before she left for camp, Anna gets sick and has some brain damage due to the illness. Pansy soon finds out that Anna isn't the same person she used to be.It's a lot more to it than that - you have a girl who is dealing with losing her best friend and the sad yet wishful thinking of things returning to normal, and then her trying to move on. Even though her friend is alive, there is a loss there. It's about being honest with yourself and your friends, and best of all, it's\u00a0about finding yourself.Describe the book in 5 wordsSad. Uplifting. BFFs. Growth. Extraordinary!Who was your favorite character, and why?There aren't many characters in Extraordinary. You have Pansy, the main character whose POV we get in the story. Anna, her best friend. Andy, who is Anna's twin brother and friend of Pansy as well. And, other friends that Pansy meets along the way. Besides Pansy, I adored Andy. He's a great friend to Pansy, and you can tell that he is having a hard time of it too. I honestly wish we would have gotten a few of his scenes because it would be beneficial to a young reader to know what HE is going through.Who would LOVE Extraordinary?Anyone looking for a book with serious themes, but is light and fun at the same time. Ms.\u00a0Miriam did a great job keeping parts light because lets to real, things could have turned out pretty depressing! I think it's an important story for a young reader.Are there Illustrations?No, there isn't.Overall thoughtsI really liked Extraordinary! There was one part towards that end that had me crying happy tears! It's an uplifting story, one that even I as an adult took from. I highly recommend it for home and classroom! received this book for free from The Publisher in exchange for an honest review.

The premise sounded interesting, but I was going to put it back... until I flipped to the author bio and found out that the author was an ex-public school teacher in my old school district (yes, I was public schooled for a year - shocker), and now she works with homeschooled students! SO COOL! That was basically the only reason I actually got it, but when I dived into the book, it was actually super cute!

I read a really early draft of this book, and loved it then. I love it even more now.

Anna is daring and brave, exactly the traits that Pansy wishes she had if she didn't chicken out of everything. Like when Anna cut her hair for Locks of Love and joined the Girl Scouts so that she could go on the annual camping trip. Things that they were supposed to do together until Pansy got too scared. Pansy and Anna then had a huge fight and Anna went off to camp without her where she contracted meningitis and sustained a serious brain injury. Since then Anna hasn't been the same and Pansy has been trying to be the sort of friend, the extraordinary friend that Anna would want her to be so that after her surgery Anna will be proud of her. But, being extraordinary all of the time is very difficult and Anna's surgery is quickly approaching. I've read many a book on individuals who have sustained a brain injury during my time as a speech therapist. Usually, the books were written by the person or a family member. Miriam Spitzer Franklin takes on the interesting perspective of am 11-year-old girl who's friend has the injury, a friend that she has just had a huge fight with. The story actually follows Pansy as she navigates her way through the beginning of fifth grade and much of her experiences have that middle-grade feel. There are the math times table speed drills, learning to roller blade, and logging reading minutes and taking quizzes to be the top of the class. Promises that Pansy had previously made to Anna, that she vows to now keep. I enjoyed the addition of Anna's twin brother, Andy. The three of them were friends and there are glimpses of how Andy is handling Anna's injury, which truthfully I would've loved to seen more of. Pansy's attempts to be extraordinary are her ways of making up all of the things that she didn't do for her friend before her illness. I quickly got wrapped up with Pansy and how she wishes that her friend could be the person she was, and how she hopes that the surgery to fix her seizures will return her to the person she once was. A very compelling story and characters that you can relate to very quickly. Franklin certainly takes care with the story and despite Pansy's confidence that the surgery will fix her friend, she doesn't give the reader those expectations. Overall, this was a wonderful heartfelt story of friendship, a girl who wants to be extraordinary for her friend and coming to terms with the changes that occur following an injury such as this."}, {"userName": "kazually", "userReviewDate": "Apr 27, 2018", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/64195152-kazually", "userReview": "a sweet story about friendship and overcoming one's self"}, {"userName": "Stephanie", "userReviewDate": "Nov 05, 2016", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/29299540-stephanie", "userReview": "Pansy has been struggling since her best friend Anna contracted meningitis and suffered a stroke, leaving her with irreversible brain damage.

She did not remember or understand anyone but was strong and was going to get an operation in fourteen weeks, four days. Each chapter Anna is closer to her opperation that will stop her brain seizures, but Pansy belives a miracle will happen and Anna will become her old self again.In this book Pansy is trying to be extordinary for Anna. Right before Anna left they got in a big fight because pansy had chickened out on going to sleep away camp just like she chickened out on ice skating lessons, cutting her hair for locks of love, and more. Pansy is trying to make it up to Anna by cutting her hair to locks of love, learning to ice skate, joining girl scouts, and even being the top of the independent reading list like Anna had tried so hard to do she wanted to make things up to anna for when she got better. In her new 6th grade class her teacher announces that they are going to have an ice skating party at the end of december if they earn it. But doing all of these things are not as easy as they seem she has to work very hard to be able to do this stuff, and she does not have much time for having fun because of it. She and Anna's twin brother Andy are good friends too but as Pansy starts hanging out with Maddison, Emma, and Hannah then they aren't very good friends anymore, and at recess he starts hanging out with Daniel while she is with the girls. They fight and things are hard enough for Pansy. Then it is time for the operation and Pansy's heart is broken as she sees Anna is not the same and will never be. As Pansy is so sad she finally decides to go to the party after having 2nd thoughts she decides to keep moving on and go to the party with her other friends. She learns a lot in this book. The lessons learned in this book is to keep moving on even when it is rough, it is okay to have more than one friend, and just because it is not what you expect or want it can still be good in a different way. When Pansy finds out Anna is never going to be the same she breaks down finding out she did all this for nothing but then thinking about what Anna would want for her she gets up and keeps moving on. Next part of moving on is being with her other friends she made that year at first all she wants is Anna and no one else but her mom teaches her it is okay to have more that one friend. Finally when Pansy finds out that Anna is never going to be the same she is so sad but the Liddells (Annas family) are happy because when Anna had a chance to die from the surgery she made it out alive.In this book I liked all the lessons and Pansy's hard work and improvement in herself and all the happy thing with her and Anna. But this book is VERY sad and I was near tears at the end. You become very connected with the characters and when I read about Anna never being the same I was very sad and thought even though Pansy pulled through it was sill a very sad ending. I wish that the author did not make it so sad and painful to read at the end because through the book Pansy thinks and has great memories of her and Anna together. But at the end Andy also said that he forgot to tell Pansy that Anna wrote a note to him and it said \"p.s. I forgot Pansy's address. So if you see her, will you tell her were still best friends 4ever\". Even though that was the saddest book ever at least Pansy ended up knowing that all along Anna definitely forgave her."}, {"userName": "J.C.", "userReviewDate": "Mar 16, 2016", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/4929593-j-c", "userReview": "Extraordinary by Miriam Spitzer Franklin is truly an extraordinary book, and one of the best I\u2019ve read in a while. While the book is targeted for middle grade readers, I enjoyed it thoroughly as a teenager and thought it was a beautifully written tale.On the same note, there were a few issues I had with it\u2014not enough to degrade my appreciation or my rating, but enough for me to want to at least mention in my review, so I\u2019ll dive into that now and get it done with so I can move onto my positives. Negatives:  First off, the characters, at first, appeared very stereotypical. To me, Pansy felt like a typical MG (Middle Grade) protagonist, and in the beginning it felt like I\u2019d read the book already only because the stereo-typicalness of the characters. Anna\u2019s the typical best friend\u2014she loves to have fun, is super outgoing, loves dragging her friend into crazy situations, and yet still goes out of her way to care for others. Middle grade has cliches as much as YA, and the main one is the Awesome (and Perfect) Best Friend Stereotype, which Anna fit almost perfectly. Her character was so typical it made it hard to truly understand her, only because I\u2019ve read so many other books with best friends just like her. This isn\u2019t necessarily a bad thing (I\u2019ll address this in a bit) and I understand the importance of why the author chose to Anna that way, but to me, the girl who hates all forms of cliche, it lowered my love for the book just a bit. As well, some elements of the plot, like Pansy becoming the popular girl\u2019s friend because the popular girl is actually really nice and it\u2019s only her friends who are mean\u2014or the typical drama with the boy friend who\u2019s she not hanging out with as much, and whom she realizes she\u2019s hurt, but he\u2019s hurt her\u2014are more things I\u2019ve seen dotted over middle grade books EVERYWHERE. However, like I said earlier, it isn\u2019t necessarily a bad thing. There are only so many personality types to go around. To make Anna a shy, quiet, artsy girl wouldn\u2019t have worked in this storyline, and to make Andy and Pansy perfect friends, or Madison the bully and not have a friendship there, would\u2019ve taken away a lot of the sub-plotline and a lot of the messages. Essentially, while it\u2019s impossible to say the stereotype isn\u2019t there, it WAS done in a way where it was needed for the story, and it was done well, to the author\u2019s credit. It flowed naturally and didn\u2019t read like a stereotype. As well, it slowly went away as the story went on\u2014Pansy developed her own character and slowly escaped the stereotype I thought she was, becoming her own person with a unique personality. Andy showed more promise, and Madison, while still being a bit atypical, also became more likeable. The main problem I had with this was the whole message towards the end that creeped in, saying, \u201cThere\u2019s no such thing as miracles.\u201d Granted, I understand that the author was trying to send the message of reality and how you can\u2019t change reality, but I wish she wouldn\u2019t have taken that stance. You don\u2019t have to straight out say miracles don\u2019t exist to portray a message that things are the way they are and that you have to accept that. It WAS only mentioned once or twice, so it was easy to overlook. I do understand why she did it, and this isn\u2019t something I straight-out hated; I just wanted to note it because it\u2019s not exactly something I loved, either. Okay\u2014done with that, we can move on to what I DID love. Plotline:  The story and plot were amazing and so well done. The flashbacks are done skillfully, capturing Anna\u2019s voice even though we haven\u2019t actually met the real Anna. The story plays out so heartbreakingly in the way it is told, especially considering coming from a middle grade girl\u2019s point of view. Pansy\u2019s struggles are portrayed well, realistically without being too much for younger readers, while still being enough to make it a deeper story. I felt the author truly captured what it was like for Pansy, truly showed us what life was like from her eyes as she navigated the tricky landscape, trying to grasp the reality while still trying so hard to hope. It was beautifully painted. Anna\u2019s sickness was described well, not diving into any detailed medical information, but still providing enough to understand. The important thing in the story was that Anna had it, and how or why or what caused it was irrevelent to the story; from that standpoint I thought it was just fine that there was really no medical facts or information (besides, a girl Pansy\u2019s age wouldn\u2019t even know that sort of thing).  Writing:  The writing was very good. Everything tied together well, there were no filler chapters or drawn-out scenes, and every scene and character contributed to the plot and with moving the story forward. The sub-plots, I felt, had just as strong positive messages, despite the stereotype-feel. It all came together wonderfully in the end, creating a truly beautiful story.I loved the role her parents played in the plot, and I loved the way they were portrayed. They weren\u2019t the typical parents you meet in everyday MG; instead, they were unique, and well-developed, proving to be great guides and companions for Pansy while still retaining the parental role. They weren\u2019t cheesy or stiff, and were written in the way parents in MG novels should be written\u2014as helpful and loving guides\u2014instead of strict, mean tyrants or unaware, cheesy adults to avoid. Unfortunately, these two types are all too common in many MG novels and it was nice to see kind, realistic, and actually developed characters as parents in a book. Granted, there are many good MG novels with good parent figures\u2014it\u2019s just that far too many of them completely disregard, or misinterpret, the meaning of a parent\u2019s role in a child\u2019s life that it\u2019s a real positive to me to see a book that doesn\u2019t do that.It was a short, sweet read, and despite the few stereotypes, it truly was a beautiful book, written well, and to the point. It dealt with a serious issue with enough lightness for it to not be a serious depresser\u2014also light enough for young readers\u2014while with still enough depth to make you think and to appeal to older readers. So despite my few negatives, it was outweighed by the positives and so I can wholeheartedly say I loved this book and would recommend it highly. A beautiful story about friendship and which will make you appreciate your friends more than before, this hidden gem of a novel captivated me from beginning to end. 5.0 stars.Like my reviews?

It was just like when they went to get their hair cut for Locks of Love; only one of them walked out with a new hairstyle, and it wasn\u2019t Pansy. But Pansy never got the chance to make it up to Anna. While at camp, Anna contracted meningitis and a dangerously high fever, and she hasn\u2019t been the same since. Now all Pansy wants is her best friend back\u2014not the silent girl in the wheelchair who has to go to a special school and who can\u2019t do all the things Pansy used to chicken out of doing. So when Pansy discovers that Anna is getting a surgery that might cure her, Pansy realizes this is her chance\u2014she\u2019ll become the friend she always should have been. She\u2019ll become the best friend Anna\u2019s ever had\u2014even if it means taking risks, trying new things (like those scary roller skates), and running herself ragged in the process.Pansy\u2019s chasing extraordinary, hoping she reaches it in time for her friend\u2019s triumphant return. But what lies at the end of Pansy\u2019s journey might not be exactly what she had expected\u2014or wanted.", "title": "Extraordinary", "url": "http://www.goodreads.com/book/show/23130145-extraordinary", "average": 4.15, "cover": "https://images.gr-assets.com/books/1414559681l/23130145.jpg", "reviews": 78, "authors": [{"url": "https://www.goodreads.com/author/show/8302751.Miriam_Spitzer_Franklin", "name": "Miriam Spitzer Franklin"}], "type": ["Childrens", "Realistic Fiction", "Contemporary", "Young Adult", "Childrens"], "outlinks": ["http://www.goodreads.com/book/show/23130145-extraordinary", "http://www.goodreads.com/book/show/25556642-extraordinary", "http://www.goodreads.com/book/show/28226507-call-me-sunflower", "http://www.goodreads.com/book/show/37588510-emily-out-of-focus"]}
