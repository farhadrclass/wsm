It rambled, it was pointless, it made no sense. Sinclair was such a pale imitation of his former self. He always reminded me of Roark; now he\u2019s just a goofy, somewhat neutered Queen\u2019s consort, not the big, bad incredibly sexy vampire he used to be. I ended up putting this down to skim through Undead and Unwed before I even finished this \u2013 I loved that book, a 5* top 10 favorite PNR book for me. Betsy was snarky and ridiculously self centered but so much fun; Jessica was snarky and awesome (and ran The Foot, which was cool), and there was a genuine plot between lines that had me LOL. Here, the first half of the book went exactly nowhere and while there were a few references to the mess the former two books were (alternate time lines, Ancient Betsy \u2013 and boy did this book need a prologue/recap of some sort!), overall it didn\u2019t get much better even when a hint of a plot emerged. At one point towards the end, Betsy is thinking about the one wish she was able to ask of the Devil and remembers her internal debate \u2013 \u201cask for something for Sinclair or her beloved Christian.\u201d I spent about an hour looking over reviews, websites, etc., all trying to figure out the character Christian who she loved so much. All of a sudden it came to me \u2013 Christian Loubouton, her favorite (but no longer existing) shoe designer! Talk about a comment out of left field. That sort of sums up the book \u2013 there were either not-really-funny Betsy-isms or things coming out of left field \u2013 or things ruminated upon (Jessica\u2019s pregnancy) that were never really explained. Well, Jessica\u2019s pregnancy weirdness was explained (and perhaps there is still more to the babies?) but it never made sense as to why no one, including Jessica, seemed bothered by the whole \u201chow far along is she?\u201d question. Was there a purpose in having Betsy meet Jessica\u2019s parents in Hell? I also hate books where a character (here it is The Ant) knows stuff but won\u2019t tell\u2026feels they need to be all mysterious and \u201cyou must figure it out yourself\u2026\u201d Why? Why not just tell the person (meaning Betsy) what she needs to know. Why is figuring it out yourself better? Blech! The last couple of pages were good, teasing me that perhaps this horrible storyline is over and the series will be going in a new direction? Not sure I\u2019m ready to completely give up on Betsy and the gang (although I am not sure I can continue much longer if Jessica doesn\u2019t get better, and if Betsy doesn\u2019t learn to call Nick Dick! And please let them do something with poor Zombie Mark!!).MJD wrote some awesome stuff a long while ago. Her first two Wyndam Werewolf short stories were perfect; the first few Undead books were a lot of fun; even her first Alaska book was a hoot! She used to write hot, sexy, funny books, and I keep reading, hoping she\u2019ll get back to that style of writing. Unfortunately, I fear, like so many other authors, she\u2019s never going back to her former glory days."}, {"userName": "Christy", "userReviewDate": "Jun 14, 2013", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/967904-christy", "userReview": "Okay, but I think it is past time to wrap this series up. One that I used to love so much. All I could keep thinking was ... what is the STORY here? I'm bored with Betsy being selfish, and everyone reminding her she is selfish, and she acknowledges that she is selfish. BORED. I was glad to see the change in book 9, and looked forward to what was to come. And what was up with Eric turning into...a puss? Did not like it at all.The final straw? You get \"the point\" of the book, which was tiring to read, all in the last ten pages. Which pisses me off because it could have been done in the last freaking book to make it better for one thing, and now, I want to see what develops in the next book in the hopes that I will love this series again.I hate giving negative reviews, especially when I once loved this series but... I agree it needed to go in a different direction, but some of the comedy only goes so far.

It's time to wrap up this series. This book wasn't really about anything. It's Betsy bitching for nearly 300 pages and while it's exciting that we are getting some chapters from Sinclair's POV... it turns out, he's not nearly as brooding or as interesting as he appeared to be.Yes, I am curious to see if this Betsy turns into Ancient Betsy (and part of me really hopes she does because at least she has her shit together!) but it's just dragging. Spoilers! Only 2 things happen in this book, we find out about the babies and we find out what is going to happen to Hell now that Satan is dead. I don't feel like Betsy is growing as a character.

After some time away, I see the beauty in the madness. The book may be written to be stupid, but that's the key. The author writes with intent to be funny using stupidity as it's humor. Unlike RP, the world building isn't half through together, there is purpose in its madness. And now I've come to appreciate it. Maybe this author lost her way a few books ago, she's found it again.

Not so much anymore!! I think I'm done with it. This book was very disjointed and hard to follow (and I've read them all). If I could reach into the book and smack Betsy, I would. She's a selfish, air-headed, ditz. Sinclair has lost his mojo. There really was no action in the story at all. It didn't even have any funny moments like the first several books did. Most of all, I disliked the author inserting HER political and moral leanings into the story. In one paragraph she said that all Boy Scouts are homophobes. Two paragraphs later, Betsy was stating that she shouldn't put a label on ALL guys just because Nick/Dick doesn't understand a woman and shoes. Hypocritical much?!?! I could also do without the snark about the President and his re-election. Guess what Ms. Davidson......NOT EVERYONE WHO THINKS HOMOSEXUALITY IS WRONG IS A HOMOPHOBE AND NOT EVERYONE WHO DISAGREES WITH OBAMA'S POLICIES ARE RACIST. That said, I don't read these types of books for moral/political lessons. I read them for entertainment.

I was halfway through the book and nothing had actually happened. Just the same old rehashing of past events in a rapid-fire, confusing nonsensical vomit of words as always. (Seriously, tone down the vapidness of Betsy's inner monologues a little! It's nearly impossible to keep up with!)Through the second half, you do get some actual progression of story. Some big things do happen. There's a jarring point-of-view change that was highly confusing at first but eventually settles down into something readable.All told, this installment was better then some recent ones though not as good as the earlier stories.

As our heroine experiences more tragedy and personal growth, she loses some of her perkiness that endeared her to us. Though her husband's new found freedom makes up for that.A lot of questions get answered, only to be replaced by some new ones. At times it was hard to follow the dialogue because so much was being said and I had to really concentrate. I was wanting to finish it as soon as I could to see what happens. The switching between Betsy's POV and Sinclair's was a bit confusing. Though nice to read his POV. A second read is necessary. Definitely a different feel to these last few books compared to the pre2010.

Betsy was just really passive, watching and listening and babbling a lot but not actually doing anything. She sure didn't act like the queen of anything. At least we got some answers to what's been going on for the last bunch of books and what might be a new direction of sorts at the end. I just don't think I'm going to enjoy the new direction that much. I liked seeing Betsy dealing with people and showing her growth and maturity. We'll see how it goes.I will say that with the continued publishing of these books in hardback, I have to wonder about the constant panic about the state of the publishing industry. This series and many other long-running series are clearly still on many people's auto-buy list, despite many complaints about declining quality of the series. And my library system bought 52 copies of this book. I'd like to see authors stop complaining about library readers, please, as well. Libraries buy your books too, if you're lucky you can get 16,400 public library sales if you get just one copy in each building, nothing to sneeze at. Our 52 copies clearly included multiple copies at some branches. Add in school libraries for YA books and you have another 98,460 opportunities to sell your book. So maybe authors should make nice to the readers who can submit books they want the library to purchase to the library, or who's continued use of those early books in a series gets the next books bought over and over again. Because for me in my situation, I either read the book from the library or don't read it at all. And if the circulation numbers drop they won't buy as many books next time. Authors should be gracious about wherever you read there book, not trying to push people to buy them to bump up their sales reports. It's one thing to explain somewhere on your website what it means to have the books sold during a certain time frame. But that's it. No engagement, no complaining.Sorry about that, Book Review and a Little Rant. I'm done now. Books are good. Libraries are good. Betsy is good whether Laura wants to see it or not. Mark is good. Eric is better than we knew. The Ant might have a backstory that we'll find out about in the next book that says why she's so mean and doesn't really hate Betsey - be warned, it could get hairy."}, {"userName": "Melissa Thate", "userReviewDate": "Aug 01, 2013", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/19717123-melissa-thate", "userReview": "If you are looking for a serious, in depth read, this book is not for you. I am hooked on this series due to the pure hilarity of them (at least with my sense of humor). I laugh, and always come out a little bit happier than when I started. All the characters have weird twists, and everything that happens in the series happen in ways that other sci/fi vampire, mythical \"monster\" books, do.If you're accustomed to the typical bite, drain, drink, instant vampire. Or born a were wolf or bitten or scratched by a vampire...instant vampire. Or brainless \"brains!!!\" Zombies...even mermaid ties,etc. Also, a vast majority of MaryJanice Davidson's books are hilarious. If I can track one down, I download it, and laugh through them.OH, and the date finished is off. Truly. Who keeps track of the dates they finish books.

So I turned to my favorite \"vampire smut\" series, as I like to call it. This takes place after the last book ended with Betsy having killed Satan and altered the timeline. Her half sister, Laura (aka \"the Antichrist\"), is up in arms over her mother (Satan) having been killed, which means she is now in charge of Hell. Beyond that, there really is no discernible plot to this book. In this timeline, Jessica is pregnant, yet no one seems to know nor care how long she's been pregnant, nor has she sought pre-natal care. Sinclair can now go out in the sun and attend church and spends his time chasing after and doting on the two puppies he and Betsy now own. Marc, now a zombie, tries to keep his brain sharp by doing word puzzles. Laura pouts about her mom incessantly before dragging Betsy off to Hell so she can see firsthand the mess she created by killing Satan - even though Satan basically asked for it. Tina and Betsy's mom were their normal selves.Towards the end, the point of this book does materialize but really, this could have been a novella instead of a full on novel. This is not a series I read for literary greatness, but rather because it's the fun, campy escape we all need from time to time. And, up until the last three (now four) books, when the in-series trilogy was introduced, I have really enjoyed this series and since there are only a few books left, I will continue reading it to see how it ends and will also check out her other books as I do enjoy MaryJanice Davidson's humor and imagination."}, {"userName": "Chelsea", "userReviewDate": "Aug 30, 2013", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/20299408-chelsea", "userReview": "This one was definitely a step in the right direction. There were still ridiculous parts that made no sense; Like the suggestion that BabyJon spends more time with Betsy than with her mother. I'd have to go back and reread to prove it and there isn't a stone throw's chance in Hell of that happening, but I don't think BabyJon has even stayed with them since Betsy switched the timelines. But anyway, besides a few parts that seemed less than consistent, it wasn't intolerable to read. The ending left me curious about the next book, but Laura's dramatic character shift didn't make any sense. It's like she wanted to start a new story arch and contorted Laura to fit the story rather than work the story around the 10 books that have established Laura's character before this one. Much like the rest of the Betsy books, MJD's writing gives the impression of sloppy, slap-dashed together story construction, but at least Betsy's character didn't make me want to gouge out my own eyeballs this time."}, {"userName": "Nicole", "userReviewDate": "Aug 28, 2013", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/3664909-nicole", "userReview": "This is the first book in a very long time I very nearly DNF. It was put down, other books read and then picked back up (due to a stubborn streak).Betsy has always been a shallow, vapid, ditzy, superficial character. From the outset. Which I enjoyed as a \"popcorn read\" (like popcorn movies where you forget what you just indulged in as soon as you walked out of cinema/put down book).But this book, as has been said in quite a few reviews before me, have pointed out that as a reader one starts wondering if anything is going to happen. It does, but so far to the end and almost hidden it's almost like an Easter egg.
