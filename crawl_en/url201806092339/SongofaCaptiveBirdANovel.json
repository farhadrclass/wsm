I had NO IDEA how good this book would be. This book is inspired by the life and poetry of Forugh Farrokhzad. She was amazing! She went against the grain of what an Iranian woman should be in those times. She was a great poetis, feminist and activist.

We take part in a variety of historical fiction and nonfiction history group reads and discussions, and are given an occasional opportunity to review advance reader copies. One such book is Song of a Captive Bird, the debut novel by Jasmin Darznik, an Iranian American literature professor who resides in northern California. Although this book is slotted as a group read in a few months, I was drawn to the pretty color, which lightened up a gray winter day. Combined with a captivating subject matter, I could not resist to read this tale of Iranian feminist poet Forugh Farrokhzad a few months in advance.It is 1950s Iran. Although it is decades before the Khomeini family overthrew the shah and his antiquated form of government, Iran is still an eastern powerhouse country, devoid of many eastern influences. Women do not have to wear a burka that is emblematic with their status today, but their rights were limited nonetheless. Girls were lucky to receive an eighth grade education, and unmarried women and girls could rarely leave their homes unless they were chaperoned by a male relative. Women went from being the property of their fathers to that of their husbands and unless they were fortunate enough to marry a forward thinking person, still were relegated to life within their homes. Forugh Farrokhzad was a rebellious daughter of Colonel Farrokhzad. From an early age she desired more than a life as an obedient daughter turned wife, and was influenced by the extensive library her father kept in their home. Despite receiving only the requisite eighth grade education, Forugh kept up her learning through reading and then eventually writing poetry. What is more, despite the attitude toward women writers during the era, her father initially encouraged her forays into writing. This changed one day when Forugh showed promise as a poet.Coming of age, Forugh thought she found true love in the form of a cousin Parviz Shapour. Her father not knowing what to do with her rebellious daughter, married her off before she brought shame to the family. Shipped off to rural Ahwez, Forugh became the property of Parviz and by extension his mother. She became a prisoner in their humble abode and longed for life back in Tehran. After giving birth to her son Kamyan, Forugh longed for her family only to discover than Parviz had no desire to travel to the nation's capital city. Craving independence from her husband, Forugh turned to writing and had invitations to publish in some of the city's start up intellectual literary journals of the time. Traveling to the capital alone under the guise of visiting her mother, Forugh began to make a name for herself in poetry circles, albeit a scandalous one. As a result, she brought the shame to her family that the Colonel had feared during Forugh's teenage years. The feminist poems which influenced a generation of school girls, but lead to Forugh's divorce from Parviz as he did not wish to be married to a modern woman who did not fit the mold of demure Iranian wife and mother.Equating marriage as bird captive in a cage, Forugh makes a name for herself as a poet and forges a strong female friendship with Qajar heiress Leila Farmayan who becomes her entry into the upper crust of Tehran society. While Darznik has take poetic license in creating this friendship, she uses it as a means to touch on the crumbling Iranian society amidst student uprisings in the later 1950s and early 1960s. The discovery of oil in Iran brought an influx of English and American influences into the country, and, with the arrival of westerners, the desire of the younger generation to enjoy better human rights. Leading to various factions in both the government and society, people lived in constant fear until these student protests quelled. In the midst of this activism, Forugh continued to write poetry volumes, which lead to a meeting and relationship with film director Darius Golshiri. Darznik takes much license in their relationship as well, but uses it to touch on the changing place of women in society. Unfortunately, in a country as Iran, the more things changed especially with increasing western influence, the more men asserted themselves as superior to women. Forugh's place as a poet and later as a film director cemented her place in intellectual circles, but many still believed that men wrote her work and wished her to stop writing. This criticism only encouraged Forugh to continue writing.In her afterward, Darznik writes that when her family fled Iran in 1978, her mother smuggled out two volumes of Forugh's poetry. Seeing this poetry as a child led to Darznik's fascination with the poetess later in life, which eventually lead to her research for this book. She includes translated poems throughout the text including the title poem Song of a Captive Bird. I found the poetry to be more mature than the prose, but felt that the prose flowed well for a debut novel. I myself grew fascinated with Forugh Farrokhzad's life and would be intrigued to read some of her poetry past the selections featured in this novel. Combined with the sensory stimulating cover and feminist poetry, Darznik shows promise as a continuing novelist, and I would look forward to reading her future novels.Breakdown:4.5 story3 writing4 poetry3.5 overall"}, {"userName": "Elyse", "userReviewDate": "Feb 19, 2018", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/597461-elyse", "userReview": "Audiobook....narrated by Mozhan Marno 5++++stars!!!!!LOVED IT!

A girl\u2019s education stopped when she was fourteen. A lack of virginal blood on a wedding night could send a bride into banishment. And a girl was forbidden from being outside without a chaperone and it was frowned on for a married woman to be in public unattended. Everything revolves around a woman\u2019s honor. \u201cMine was a country where they said a woman\u2019s nature is riddled with sin, where they claimed that women\u2019s voices had the power to drive men to lust and distract them from matters of both heaven and earth.\u201dForugh Farroukhzad was a poet during this time and considered one of the first Iranian feminists. Poetry held a special place in Iran. Men would recite it over coffee at night and poets were held in high esteem. Well, male poets. \u201cThere was a strict division between a poet and a poetess. No matter how skillful her writing, a woman was invariably given the feminine moniker.\u201d And that moniker was always defined as something less, something trite. This fictional telling of her short life is a slow burn. Starting with her childhood, she takes up writing poetry to impress her father. Her mother is convinced she\u2019s possessed by a jinn. Her marriage is a disaster and she rediscovers poetry. Her decisions give her the freedom to write but at a terrific cost. Darznik does an amazing job telling the story. Never once did I feel I was hearing anything other than Forugh\u2019s voice. I felt her fear, her despair and her anger. This is a book that will make you angry. I mean really angry. Imagine being told you have to stop yourself from thinking, because it\u2019s thinking that has made you insane. Even the so called \u201cliberal\u201d men sought to take advantage of her and screw her over. As the book progresses it becomes more political concerning the regime. This is a strong book, but a sad one. The addition of Forugh\u2019s actual poetry was a huge plus. For anyone that appreciates historical fiction, I highly recommend this book.

Iran in the 1950s and 60s came to life for me; gorgeous settings, interesting culture, and captivating people. Forugh\u2019s story, her life, left an indelible mark on me. Starting with her childhood, we learn that Forugh was expected to be quiet and modest; however, she questioned authority, social mores, the status of women, the roles of women, all starting at a young age. Each time she embraced a challenge head-on, she was pushed back, pushed down, even held captive; but every single time, she rose again. In my lifetime, I\u2019m not sure I\u2019ve heard of a female poet being less than and referred to as a poetess? That was the life and time that Forugh lived in. Her biggest wish was to be referred to simply as a \u201cpoet.\u201d Forugh was creative, resilient, vibrant, and vital in pushing forward women\u2019s rights and human rights in her country. Song of a Captive Bird is the perfect title for this book in multiple ways. Oh what an alluring voice Forugh had to share with the world!

Her poetry was banned in Iran in 1979 and her grave is a place of pilgrimage still. At great personal cost, she broke down many barriers to pursue her art - cultural, social and structural. I had never heard of her and was attracted to the book mainly because I enjoy Middle Eastern writing. I don\u2019t think I even realised that it was about a real person.Jasmin Darznik inhabits Forugh\u2019s life so convincingly that I often had to remind myself that I wasn\u2019t reading an autobiography. By her own admission, she had to invent a great deal because, it is believed, Forugh\u2019s family destroyed most of her personal papers after her death. Although she left Iran when she was 5, the author obviously has access to family and friends who can tell her what life was like during Forugh\u2019s lifetime, ie 1935-1967. During this period, there was a lot of political turmoil in Iran and Forugh was often caught up in it. Her lifestyle was abhorrent to traditional Iranians and it wasn\u2019t until she was in her 20s that she met likeminded people and saw a different side to life than the one in which she\u2019d been trapped. A life that had more possibilities than restrictions. She was immensely brave, if sometimes naive, to make the decisions that she did and to risk so much. Forugh was also a talented documentary maker. I watched some of her film about a colony of lepers, The House is Black, on YouTube and found it very moving. The author has interspersed the text with poems that she herself has translated. On occasions her choice was perfect. Forugh\u2019s poetry is based on her life.

She was a literary sensation, and acclaimed filmmaker, who was both loved and hated within her country. A country she loved and would never leave. The book follows her turbulent life, from her controlled and abusive childhood, though her oppressive teenage marriage, the birth of her son, her passionate literary career, her affairs of the heart and her death in a car crash in 1967. Forugh came of age in the 1940\u2019s and 1950\u2019s, at a time of upheaval in Iranian history. The novels opens one morning, with her mother forcing a bruised and battered Forugh to a clinic in the poorest and dirtiest district of Tehran, the bottom of the city, for a virginity test. It\u2019s an experience which leaves the sixteen-year-old Forugh shaken and forever changed. \u2018It was the end of her girlhood and the true beginning of her life\u2019. She begins writing poetry to capture her father\u2019s attention, who at first is amused by his daughters efforts. But as Forugh continues writing her black-eyed father withdraws his support, and he marries her off to Parviz, who rejects her on their wedding night. She is unhappy in the marriage, and in living under the roof of her domineering mother-in-law. Shortly after her son is born she sneaks back to Tehran in an naive effort to have her sensuous poetry published. Her first poem \u201cSin\u201d is published under her own name, which set off an avalanche of life altering events. \u201cWhen I left my father and then my husband I lost my name and I was no one. But there was freedom in this, to be a woman on my own, it made me strong and it made me the poet I wanted to be. I knew many poets whose lives have nothing to do with their poetry. They were only poets when they sat down to write. They would finish a poem and then turn back into greedy, shortsighted, miserable, envious people. Well I could never believe in their poetry because I could never believe in them.\u201dREVIEWForugh\u2019s character was so well-developed that you can\u2019t help but have empathy for her. You could feel the pain from her father\u2019s kicks, you can feel her dank and sweaty sheets in the hospital, and you could feel her heart racing as she ran from the machine gun spray. This story of Forugh\u2019s quest for independence is both breathtaking and admirable. The writing is beautifully lyrical and captivatingly descriptive. It is a breathless ride that skillfully transports us not only through the story, but specifically to that time in history, and to a house in Tehran with a garden full of lush roses, jasmine, honeysuckle, and dahlia blossoms. Lovers of feminist, literary and historical fiction will appreciate this book about a female poet whose name in Persian means \u2018eternal light.\u2019 The author, Jasmin Darznik used Forugh\u2019s poetry, letters and films to create this powerful fictional account of a rebellious but brave woman. Darznik is a professor of English and creative writing at California College of the Arts. She came to America from Iran in 1978 when she was three years old.

It's restrictions, brutality.Forough Farrokhsad grew up in the Shah's Iran. One can only imagine the courage it took Forough to follow her calling, writing poems, poems that read like a story. Her courage to express herself as a woman, feelings we women experience along our lives.To understand her determination not to be silenced, one has to understand \"modern\" Iran. Women were expected to stay at home, silent. To express an opinion was not tolerated, and punished.This is a book which needs to be read widely, by women and men.Even today many of my Iranian friends deny the Shah's regime's brutality, yet thousands left Iran. This speaks volumes on the Shah's regime.Forough pushed herself through all the barriers never holding back her truth...she passed away at 32 killed in a car accident.I will add pictures, poems by Farough an book titles to her poems which are sold today around the world when this book is published.This beautiful book will be sold at book stores February 13, 2018P.S.Although the Shah's regime was brutal, the revolution against the Shah in 1979 ushered in an even harsher regime run by Islam."}, {"userName": "Tasha", "userReviewDate": "May 27, 2018", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/3589603-tasha", "userReview": "Overall I enjoyed this story.

Although I can see why Darznik added that storyline, I was still disappointed to find out one of the most emotional parts of the story was entirely fictional. Without Leila, much of the story's plot becomes a quickly tumbling house of cards. Even knowing the story was largely guesswork, it still made me question what facts there were in the story. Since there is so little information about Forugh, it is hard to know. I was also puzzled as to why the author changed Ebrahim Golestan's name to Darius Golshiri when they were blatantly the same person. Perhaps because Ebrahim Golestan is still alive? The author also left out some big events in Forugh's life such as her time in Europe and her adoptive son. Darznik claimed this was due to insufficient documentation, but was there really any less than the other things she did include? Or the fictional characters and plot lines that she added in?

The story follows loosely the real life of an Iranian poet named Forough Farrokhzad. She was a rebel in a world where women weren\u2019t allowed to be rebellious. She was the embodiment of liberal thought living amongst people who would prefer women to raise families and be obedient. She had a voice in a place where women were told to remain silent.I didn\u2019t know much about her and if you try to Google Forough Farrokhzad, there really isn\u2019t much about her there either. Jasmin Darznik believed the only way to tell the story of this famous female poet was through fiction. By adapting her voice and her thoughts, Darznik was able to bring to life a person who\u2019s very own tragically ended too soon.In the author\u2019s notes (which I strongly encourage you to read), Darznik explains her process and how fiction felt like the only way to tell this story. I couldn\u2019t agree with her more and even though there are some events that are completely fictionalized, you can\u2019t tell where the line crosses. You don\u2019t care if the line crosses because even if it isn\u2019t real, it felt real. Even if what Forough went through didn\u2019t happen, you can see it happening for thousands of women living in Iran during this time period.I had to repeatedly remind myself that this is fiction. This is loosely based on her life and the history of Iran during the 1950s and 1960s. This had some factual evidence, but for the most part, it wasn\u2019t real. But it read so real. Using the first person POV, I feel like Darznik was able to embody Forough for little bit and I was able to hear her story told to me first hand. Even though I was reading words, I felt like I was listening to a story. I sat with my hands grasped at my mouth happy and sad and angry and relieved and eventually heartbroken by the story being told.This book does carry a lot of triggers. There\u2019s a lot of pain and suffering. Even though Forough was considered one of Iranian\u2019s best poets, she had her fair share of tough times. But her strength felt like a solider who kept on fighting. Her poetry was her weapon and the words were her cunning blows. There were parts that made me want to cry while I read about Forough\u2019s lust for freedom. I shook my fists when she was brutally beaten by her own father and when she was forced into an insane asylum. I raged at how women were treated in Iran through the vicarious point of view of our main character.I can probably go on about how lovely the writing is here. Darznik is truly a gifted writer who is able to embody her characters. There were quotes for days in this book. If I could, I would highlight passages that resonated so much to me. The book also includes poems from Forough relating back to the passage you read. Reading her poetry alongside her story was so well thought out and structured. It was like you just witnessed genius happen in front of you. That might be an over-exaggerated statement, but I loved this book.I\u2019ve always been a believer that you can learn things from fiction. You can get caught up in facts and figures and analyze any text, but when you use fiction as your arsenal you can tap into the raw emotions and grab the reader in a different way. You get the perspective of a person or people from a source you can\u2019t get from non-fiction or from the Internet. Forough\u2019s life in this book is an example of that."}, {"userName": "Yelda Basar Moers", "userReviewDate": "Feb 27, 2018", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/3687216-yelda-basar-moers", "userReview": "\"Mine was a country where they said a woman's nature is riddled with sin, where they claimed that women's voices had the power to drive men to lust and distract them from matters of both heaven and earth...Because I was a woman, they wanted to silence the screams on my lips and stifle the breath in my lungs. But I couldn't stay quiet.\"I love to hear of unheard stories of women who fought bravely for women in history. I just finished Song of A Captive Bird, a new historical novel that chronicles and honors the life of famed Persian poet Forugh Farrokhzad, whose life and work paved the way for feminism in Iran. Farrokhzad grew up in Tehran in the 1940s and 1950s, married young and had a child, all while she was cultivating her voice in poetry. She soon had an affair, published her poetry, divorced and lost custody of her son. In the end she had to sacrifice almost everything including her life (she died tragically at the young age of 32) to oppose the oppressive ways that women were expected to live in Iran during her times. Her daring life was clearly as compelling as her poetry, which I absolutely loved!Sadly I can\u2019t say the same for this book as a work of literature, but I was riveted by Farrokhzad\u2019s harrowing journey to make a true life for herself as a modern woman and poet. This could have been an incredible historical novel, but there were too many shortcomings including too many lengthy descriptions that didn\u2019t move the story forward and what I found to be a cumbersome writing style and narrative that jumped around and didn\u2019t progress fluidly. Also Farrokhzad\u2019s poetry was dropped in from time to time like a visitor rather than being woven into the story. I felt there was a disconnect between the poetry of the poet and the narrator who was telling the story, though they were both supposed to be the same person!Ultimately, for me, the book never really came alive and was missing a kind of life force energy, or soul, except during the parts where Farrokhzad was committed to a mental institution. The book started to break open midway, but then stalled again. It went through too many crests and troughs and inconsistencies to make it a great book! I felt the novel needed more work and editing to really make it a polished work of literature.Still, the life and work of Forugh Farrokhzad should be honored and I applaud this writer for bringing her tragic and empowering story to light. Farrokhzad bravely fought for the recognition of the lives of women in Iran and gave them a voice. For that reason alone, it\u2019s worth reading.\"I'd lost my husband, my son, and, very nearly, my life. All that was left, the one thing that survived, but also the thing that pulled at me most fiercely, was my desire to write.\""}, {"userName": "Viv JM", "userReviewDate": "Mar 19, 2018", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/4243437-viv-jm", "userReview": "Song of a Captive Bird is the fictionalised account of the life of the late Iranian poet and filmmaker Forugh Farrokhzad. Forugh Farrokhzad grew up in 1940s/50s Tehran, where girls were encouraged to be quiet and obedient, neither of which were traits Forugh possessed. The story tells of her early marriage, her confinement in a mental asylum and the scandal and disgrace that befell her as a result of her bold and frank poetry, as well as her liberated lifestyle choices in an oppressively conservative country. She certainly suffered a lot of personal hardship in pursuance of her art.I loved this book. I thought Forugh's story was told with compassion and warmth.

I was enthralled with the story (some fiction, some non-fiction) and the author's honest writing, which gave a truly modern picture of Farugh's carefree, but troubled life. Throughout the book, the volatile history, as well as the beauty and modernity, were described in rich detail giving the reader a true taste of Iran and its people.A beautifully written account of a very creative woman who made her way on her own terms, despite living in a closed society where women had very few rights.

From that first day I heard the words spoken, it would be many consecutive days that I would hear phrases that shaped my small understanding \u2013 The Hostage Crisis, The Shah of Iran, Ayatollah Khomeini. There were images that crossed the television screen \u2013 Young male college age students, blind folded Americans, large crowds gathered around the American Embassy. This was the Iran I knew of. This was my view of the country. I was young, Middle School aged, so my interaction was left to that of a typical pre-teen.So, when I first views this novel, \u201cSong of a Captive Bird\u201c, and I read about its author, Jasmin Darzink, I recalled the well received memoir she had written, \u201cThe Good Daughter: A Memoir of my Mothers Hidden Life\u201d. I also learned from here essay\u2019s that she was one of many, as a young girl, that fled Iran just before the Revolution. She told of her families journey, her recall as a immigrant and her memory of her parents melancholy regarding a want for an eventual return to Iran. She became in wonder of the few things her mother was able to bring with her, one was a slim book of poems by Farugh Farrokhzad. These poems, that book she first looked at as a young girl, would lead to eventual writing this novel.This story of the trail blazing poet, Farugh, a defining influence of her generation, was not a subject I would readily search out. I am not much of a for poetry. However, the title and the cover of the book spoke to me. Then, as I was reading, within the beginning of a few chapters were pieces of poems that grabbed my attention. These poems were different, they were focused and expressive. They were approachable. They were not pretentious. These little pieces had me stop and look for more of Farugh\u2019s poetry:\"I\u2019ll greet the sun again.I\u2019ll greet the stream that flowed within me,The clouds that were my tallest thoughts,the aspens in the gardenthat endured seasons of drought with me,the flock of crowsthat brought me the scent of the fields at night,my mother who lived in the mirror andreflected the face of my old age,The burning wombmy lust has filled the green seeds.I\u2019ll greet them all again.\u2013 from \u201cI Will Greet the Sun Again\u201dThis world author Jasmin Darzinka has colored in for me is now much more vivid and real. This wonderful Historical Fiction, set in the 1940\u2019s through 1968, held me fixed on every word. Every heart stopping action that occurred. Farugh\u2019s life, hard with sharp jagged edges, dark as a moonless night and as colorful as the novel\u2019s cover expresses a woman who would become a voice of a country. She gave voice to women for the first time, feelings they felt, but never before manifested in word or print. Farugh enters the world bound by physical walls. Walls build to keep her restrained within the customs of her country. She, as a woman is expected to be silent and submissive. Hidden. She is born to a Father, a high-ranking colonel in the Shaw\u2019s Army, who rules his family absolutely. By a mother who had known no other life than that of the submissive wife and mother. in the background is the ever present social and political unrest of the country. Farugh rails against theses expectations placed on her, and suffers for it. After only attaining education to the age of thirteen or Fourteen, she will become a sensation at the age of nineteen with the publication of her first poem, \u201cSin\u201d.With the publication of \u201cSin\u201d she becomes, at once, both famous and infamous. Labeled. Yet, she would not be silenced. She would live a life not before witnessed in Tehran or the whole of Iran. She would create. Five books of poetry, documentaries. She would carve out a place for herself in the larger world. As with so many young and talented artist\u2019s she will leave this earth too soon. Before she does she leaves us a legacy of works that we all will be able to enjoy and appreciate for the ages.I love when I fall backwards into a great book. The kind that opens your eyes to a new world view. One you had no foundation in and out of it you come away with a new appreciation of that world or of the people in it. Jasmin Darzink delivered just that type of experience with her new novel \u201cSong of a Captive Bird.\u201d I thank her for this.

After reading this novel I'm extremely interested in her reading translations of her work.Reminiscent of many trailblazing women, Forugh's life and poetry rebelled against the societal conventions that sought to silence her feminine voice and constrain her freedom. She wrote, published, filmed, and lived on her own at a time and place that forbid such behavior from women. Moreover, I\u2019m amazed at the voice in this book! It\u2019s written like a memoir & I had to remind myself throughout that it\u2019s a novel. But it felt so authentic to me and my heart broke for her and soared at her success.

She was known for writing poems in a simple, modern style from a woman\u2019s perspective. The novel tells not only the story of her life but it also paints a picture of what life was like for women in Iran during this time period, between 1935 and 1967.Miss Farrokhzad was a woman too modern for her time and her country and she led a controversial life. She was divorced and had her son taken away from her by her ex-husband. She was committed to a mental institution because she expressed passion and lust in her poems and also because she desired the same freedoms as men. Passion and lust were something women were not allowed to feel, to speak, or even think. Women had no control over their fates. It seemed that they were confined to the house when they were little girls. They were told who to marry. The mother arranged the marriage but it was the father that had the final say. Their husbands could divorce them and cast them out for any reason they deemed appropriate. They could take another wife if it suited them. And all of this was during a time of modernization and Westernization in Iran.I had never heard of Forough Farrokhzad prior to reading this novel but I found her story and the Iranian culture very interesting. It\u2019s remarkable that she was able to live the life she did and unfortunate that she came to such an early demise. She was only 32 when she died in a car crash.

I wanted to imagine what it felt like to be the woman writing those astonishing poems. To be the woman who created herself by writing those poems. And to do this I embraced the unique power of fiction to illuminate the past.In her Author's Note following the body of Song of a Captive Bird, Jasmin Darznik explains how the meager amount of biographical material to be found on the groundbreaking Iranian feminist poet and filmmaker Forugh Farrokhzad \u201copened a space for invention\u201d and prompted her to attempt to breathe life into the memory of this artist \u2013 banned under the current regime in Iran, mostly forgotten in the West \u2013 who deserves to be remembered. The information that Darznik is able to provide paints the picture of a remarkable and brave woman \u2013 someone who insisted on speaking her truths, no matter the costs \u2013 and I 100% agree that Forugh's story demands memorialising. Unfortunately, I don't think that Darznik was equal to the task of filling in the gaps and making a real person jump off the page; this book is interesting history, but weak fiction. (And as for the history, by writing in the Author's Note that she invented some characters and erased others for the sake of narrative flow, I am also left uncertain as to this book's biographical usefulness.)\nBecause I was a woman, they wanted to silence the screams on my lips and stifle the breath in my lungs. But I couldn't stay quiet. I couldn't pretend to be modest or pure or good. No. I was a woman and I couldn't speak with the voice of a man, because it was not my voice \u2013 not true and not my own. But there was more to it than that. By writing in a woman's voice I wanted to say that a woman, too, is a human being. To say that we, too, have the right to breathe, to cry out, and to sing.\nI'll take it as fact that Forugh Farrokhzad was born in 1935, grew up in Tehran as one of seven children of a strict Colonel from the Shah's Guard, and despite some official efforts at modernisation (Western-style dresses, the banning of veils, the introduction of electricity), Iranian society retained an iron grip on its girls and women. Forced to leave school younger than her brothers, a brutal virginity test, given away in marriage at sixteen: Forugh apparently had little agency in her father's house. I don't know if it really was an extramarital affair that led Forugh to write the poem \u201cSin\u201d, but this is the verse \u2013 an expression of sexual desire from the point-of-view of a woman \u2013 that is said to have scandalised the local literary scene and led to the breakdown of Forugh's marriage. Now free to relocate back to Tehran from the hostile backwater of her husband's hometown, Forugh devoted herself to writing poems that would revolutionise the form within Iran and document both her personal experiences and the government brutalities that she witnessed. I was fascinated by the idea of Forugh being committed to a mental asylum for her writing, and while Darznik's narrative of this time wasn't particularly evocative, I would love to know if Forugh actually found her file and the doctor's notes that state she \u201cindulges delusions of pursuing a literary career and shows no insight into her present condition or the consequences of her actions for either herself or her family...The clinic has obtained copies of the patient's writings, and upon careful review these documents support the conclusion of a disordered mind.\u201d When Forugh is eventually released, she meets the filmmaker Ebrahim Golestan (given the pseudonym Darius Golshiri in the book for some reason), and he becomes her lover and her mentor, freeing the poet to employ her artistic voice in a new medium, for which she won acclaim. Tragically, Forugh died in a car crash at 32 years old (an accident according to Wikipedia; painted as an event more sinister in Darznik's account).\nExcept for what I'd written in my poems, in the end no one knew the truth about my death and no one knew the truth about our lives.\nDespite her being a professor of literature and creative writing, I really wasn't impressed with Darznik's craftsmanship; the writing was dull and the additional background information she added amounted to little more than lists of foods, the passing view from a car window, and what dress Forugh wore to this or that party. I was neither immersed in the times nor in this singular mind; even Darznik's \u201cnew translations\u201d of Forugh's poetry into English consisted of a few excerpts placed randomly into chapters where events may have inspired the verse. I am happy to now know something of Forugh Farrokhzad, but as a novel, this was just all right."}, {"userName": "Booknblues", "userReviewDate": "Feb 08, 2018", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/4280875-booknblues", "userReview": "With the US and Iran's recent histories intertwined in a variety of ways and knowing a number of educated Iranian women, I was interested in reading about the poet Forugh Farrokzhad in Jasmin Darznik's novelization of her life, Song of a Captive Bird. I am pleased to say that I did get more information about Iran's history in the 20th century and especially the lives of women during the mid-century period (1940-1960).Forugh was an extremely gifted poet as the reader can see, by examples of her poetry throughout the book. I am sure that she was a complex character and from this book one can see that she lead a difficult and interesting life. The book is told in first person from Forugh's point of view and this is the major problem I had. The voice is at odds with the beautiful poetry in the book. While, I can understand that those who write such beautiful poetry may not always be model citizens, I do expect their prose to show a degree of grace and to be cautious that their voice characterizes them well. Often, Forugh seems spoiled, petulant and rebellious and I kept feeling that there should be more to her than that.I don't want to have this criticism of mine to discourage others from reading Song of a Captive Bird because I think it is well worth the read.As a child Forugh loved the garden which her mother had created and noticed how her mother came alive working in the garden. When Iran began to be westernized, her father, The Colonel, destroyed the garden and recreated what he thought of as a more western version. Forugh notes:In the coming years, thousands of gardens would be destroyed in Tehran, but it was only much later that I\u2019d discover our garden in Amiriyeh, with all its gorgeous wild blooming, had been among the first. The old Persian gardens were quickly disappearing into oblivion, but despite all the changes that would take place in the coming years, the old walls between houses remained, and we therefore never witnessed the destruction of one another\u2019s gardens. We couldn\u2019t yet imagine what we had lost would be lost again and again.When she is given the chance to leave the country after some thought she decides:When I walked in the streets, there was a memory at every turn, a rootedness I felt in my limbs and my heart. Whatever Iran wanted to be, I loved it. I\u2019d found my life\u2019s purpose here. Every poem I\u2019d ever written was entangled with my country\u2019s story. I loved its downtrodden, small-minded, generous people. I loved them; I belonged to them.

At some point, I was completely drawn into this book and I could not put it down. Remarkable for the times that she was so open with her feelings -- and wrote about them -- at a time when women were expected to be very submissive and accepting of their place in the Iranian world. I think it took a great deal of bravery on her part and this book opened my eyes to an amazing poet and artist.I don't know much about Iran but I don't think much has changed for the women in that country or that part of the world.

Darznik used poems, letters, film and interview texts from Farrokhzad\u2019s life to craft a story that feels as if it could be biographical, if freely drawing from her imagination. An Iranian immigrant herself, Darznik\u2019s mother smuggled volumes of Farrokhzad\u2019s poems out of the country, and the ties to \u2018home\u2019 and a fascination with the woman was born: resulting in this novel, freely sharing poems and moments with us. From the start, I saw the affinity the author had for the subject in the very present voice of Forugh, each moment is clearly presented with emotion and clarity that brings the moments to life for the reader: and the natural curiosity that one would expect of a young woman finding her way in the world, seeing and questioning the rules and imbalances, and finding the courage to continue to question where others simply submit. Darznik managed, in varying degrees, the voice of the poet without overlaying a more \u2018western\u2019 judgment to the moments, allowing the reactions to feel real and plausible. By the author\u2019s admission, many of the events are imagined, as Farrokhzad\u2019s family is thought to have destroyed most of her personal papers \u2013 a not uncommon reaction to a life that was constantly at odds with their own traditions, beliefs and quiet existence amidst the political tumult of the time. In the short time that Forugh was on the earth, just 32 years, her time was spent learning, questioning and finally defining an existence that was full of possibility rather than restriction. The restrictions of tradition, of expected, of religion and political stricture: her choices were bold and daring, and uniquely dangerous. Full of questioning looks, family and societal censure and the refusal to remain in the background and mute, as was expected (and demanded) of women. The inclusion of the poetry shows a growth and understanding of the world, the one she inhabited and the one she was working to create: the emotions and growth in understanding, viewpoint and strengthening of her voice are all clearly apparent. Here is where there is often a slight disconnect \u2013 the real words of Forugh tend to show a maturity as the poetry is revealed that is often not reflected in the prose that is not of her words. A small miss, that while apparent, only provided (for me) a sense of real tensions overriding her life and choices, often bringing these moments forward with a sense that feels less interior voice and more third person. It was an interesting shift in the dynamic while reading, for sure, and one that often had me rereading a poem with a different eye. Poet, documentary maker, feminist in a place that wasn\u2019t welcoming to any sort of dissent or individual voices raised to show flaws, discrepancies or limits, the story engages as it teaches: strength, courage, imagination and a desire to self-define a life, however short, by one\u2019s own views of what should be, not what is. The strongest lesson here for me is not the struggle, nor the hurdles overcome but the true desire to be seen and loved as a complete person: female, curious, talented, intelligent and bold. A wonderful introduction to a poet with a voice that spans the chasms of difference to show the similarities.

Forugh responded with Because I'm a woman is that why? When confronted with hurdles she not only crushed her competition she ran with the sword proclaiming her peace while altering the views of woman for decades to come. So much so her work was banned and became difficult to locate much less read. Sadly many victims of abuse face similar fate being locked up in psych wards simply for being authentic.

Her poem entitled , \"Sin\" was her most famous showcasing desire from a woman's perspective. The loss of human rights, democracy, censuring without accounting for meaning, and lack of boundaries created a fire storm.
