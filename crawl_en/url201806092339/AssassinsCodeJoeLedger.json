Three American hikers have been captured and accused of spying by the Iranian military. Joe and Echo team go in to rescue them, hopefully, without sparking off a war. The mission goes well. The team is away and Joe is getting ready to follow his own exit plan when everything goes to hell. He plays tag with a couple of snipers, meets with the head of Iranian Intelligence, and gets attacked in his hotel room by a man with superhuman strength and filled teeth. Then things get ugly. Safe houses have become bloodbaths.Three different groups seem to be tracking Joe through Iran. One group is ruthless, but amateurish. They can deal damage, but nothing like the professionals Joe is used to going up against. The second group is headed by his new best friend, the sniper named Violin. When she doesn\u2019t have a laser sight on his\u2026 assets, she seems like a nice lady and she\u2019s great backup when the chips are down. The third group is\u2026 something else. They are known as the Knights of the Red Order and they are fast, strong, and utterly vicious. All three groups seem to want the flash drive given to him by his Iranian contact. A flash drive that shows pictures of a nuclear weapon that is supposedly hidden somewhere in Iran. To make matters worse, the nuke is one of several hidden around the world."}, {"userName": "Rizwan", "userReviewDate": "Mar 24, 2013", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/13091599-rizwan", "userReview": "In my trade, confidence is built on a platform whose legs are made up of good intelligence, continuous training, proper equipment, and field support. I had a sick dog, a dead man\u2019s gun, a stolen briefcase, a vampire hunter\u2019s stake in my belt, and a cell phone; and I was walking down a street in Tehran less than a day after breaking three political prisoners out of jail. I was involved in several murders and had left sufficient physical evidence behind to convict me on enough charges to lock me up until I was a thousand years old. Or enough to have me put against a wall.Oh, yeah, and there were seven hidden nuclear bombs and somehow vampires were tied up in that.My life used to be a lot less complicated.\nWithout a doubt, the BEST book of the series yet, and the best book I've read this year till now. This Awesome action thriller had it all: Insane bloodpumping violant action sequences one after the other, nuclear threats of hidden nukes (not one or two, seven!), secret shadow war between secret societies going on for 800 years, mindnumbing conspiracies, heartbreaking histories and deaths, headscratching twisted puzzles and mysteries one on top the other, ancient mathematical codex & mysterious unreadable ancient books, a truly evil genius mastermind or two, one GIANT mess of double crossing-triple crossing-hidden agendas-who what whys, tender quiet moments of philosophical & religious debate on what truly meant to be human and what is good or bad, some great characters in our heroes & the good guys (specially Echo Team, Ghost the military dog, Mr. Church, Circe & Rudy), and most of all our always lovable Joe Ledger in his Badassest Kickassest Smartassest Best! Oh, lest I forget to mention a little something: VAMPIRES. In all their blood-sucking fanged-toothing super-strengthening super-speeding red-eyeing garlic-hating psychopathic glory, in the most realistic way possible. Yeah, get your head around of that one. I'm sure I'm missing at least another half a dozen positive elements, but I think this will do. I literally couldn't stop laughing like an idiot in unabashed fun while reading some of the spectacular ridiculous sequences... One bloody fulltoos good-time that I can't praise enough. Hooah!!!\nThe vampires looked at me, at my empty hands, and smiled, showing me the jagged fangs that would tear the life out of me.I whipped out the rapid-release knife and showed them my fang.\nDefinitely one the MOST badass lines and afterward-action sequences I've ever read."}, {"userName": "Paul", "userReviewDate": "Apr 15, 2012", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/1172646-paul", "userReview": "Ok, full disclosure. I have read the earlier books in this series and I liked them so I preordered this on my nook. When it came in I consumed it quickly. I loved the science combined with the weird religious stuff. Very fun, kinda funky plot revolving around vampires! Yep, no one but Maberry could or should try and make Vampires sound scientifically valid in my opinion. Very nice twist on the undead. I loved the final sentence! With the ass kicking the hero took he needed some hope for the future besides his dog living. As usual Maberry pours on the psychological drama with his hero, one of his trademarks that differentiates his writing from the mainstream. I see that this series has been optioned for television. I hope they do it justice. Movies and TV don't always represent the author very well."}, {"userName": "Paul Montgomery", "userReviewDate": "May 24, 2012", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/8741556-paul-montgomery", "userReview": "I first caught Jonathan Maberry when I bought Patient Zero on a whim a couple of years back. Basic story was that lunatic terrorists were creating a zombie plague (of sorts), and a hastily-assembled tactical team attempted to take them out. In the course of the book, we were introduced to key characters Joe Ledger (our protagonist), Ghost (his dog), Rudy (his friend and therapist), Echo Team (the hastily-assembled tactical team), DMS (the covert agency responsible for dealing with situations like this), and Mr Church (the boss of DMS).I've never been a huge fan of the military operation books. Andy McNab does not grace my bookshelves (although I have the utmost respect for him). Zombie books do, although I'm not a hardcore obsessive. So, taking a chance, I tried a new author (something I do every now and then, usually when I've exhausted whichever author currently has me hooked. Most recently, Preston and Child. But that's another story). I was, very pleasantly, surprised. Ledger turned out to be an engaging character, with the sense of (often inappropriate) humour which tickled me. That same sense of humour helps drastically in cutting through what could be a fairly ridiculous situation. Thoroughly recommended.Anyway, following the initial Patient Zero came Dragon Factory and The King of Plagues. Each with their own new challenges for the developing Echo Team. Relationships and friendships built. Challenges were faced, adversities overcome, and each would make a fine standalone adventure. But, building behind the scenes, a bigger story started to emerge. A shadowy organisation (of Kings) bent on twisting the world for their own purposes. And lurking in the shadows, given nothing more than a throwaway moment, someone else.Which brings us to Assassin's Code. The theme of each of the books so far has been to take a genetically-modified twist on some classics - zombies, dragons, etc. This time we're treated to vampires, in the name of terrorism. Being only the fourth book in the series, this is still early enough to feel fresh, and gives a nice little take on the vampire mythos. Some familiar characters reappear, to greater and lesser degrees. And there's the usual mix of excitement, adventure, action and suffering. Maberry has a nice touch when writing action and fight scenes - enough technical info to feel interesting, without overloading. Echo Team, at this point, have their core membership and their new members (which seems to be a now standard format in the books), and as with the previous titles, no one is safe. Knowing that Maberry is not afraid to kill off established or new characters lends a nice sense of risk to every scene. (And yes, two of those deaths are brutal and upsetting. I will miss those characters.)Joe continues to evolve, and from the initial Echo Team encounter spends a good half of the book working in isolation from his teammates, accompanied only by Ghost - although relations between the two end up a little strained. Joe's backstory is expanded on a little more - the history of what led to his psyche fracturing a little, and it's nice to see that he hasn't immediately moved on from loves lost. I find Joe to be a surprisingly engaging lead, rooting for him in action, and more than once laughing at his snarkiness. His interactions with his team, Ghost, adversaries, superiors, and a potential new... partner, continue to delight. The overall story contains vamps, genetics, a race to find nuclear bombs, and a few other things which would be implausible in lesser hands (can you tell that I'm trying to avoid spoilers here?). Which makes for an ideal story.However, it's the behind-the-scenes action which raises the interest another notch. After the introduction of the Kings earlier, I suspect a pattern will be to see them returning again and again in different incarnations and/or roles. Assassin's Code uses two Kings to varying effect, and brings in another old character (marking their third, and presumably not last, appearance). Beyond them, another figure starts to move into prominence, and in doing so brings a noticeable and not fully-comfortable shift in the tone of the books. Where previously the zombies and the dragons and the vampires had been genetically modified creatures, with at least some basis in nature and/or science, this figure seems to be fully routed in the supernatural. Certainly his actions and abilities seem immediately unexplainable by conventional methods. How this pans out, we'll have to wait and see.The only other niggle I have is that all four books appear to have taken place in the space of a year. That's a tough year. And I'm not really sure that Joe and his team actually have any time to recover - mentally, emotionally, physically. Other than that, it's a hell of a book. Thoroughly enjoyable - accessible to people new to the series, but you'll benefit far more from having read the first three."}, {"userName": "Robin Edman", "userReviewDate": "Apr 11, 2012", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/2189025-robin-edman", "userReview": "It's refreshing to see talk about the Middle East that doesn't embrace hatred. I enjoyed the approach to religious tolerance, though I felt a little sorry for Captain Ledger when I learned that he believes in god, which is just silly for a man who has seen what he has seen. I am choosing to believe that it was one of his minor personality splinters who said that, though it was probably really the rule-accepting Civilized Man.Jonathan Maberry has an amazing ability to describe an action sequence and get me to follow it. This is particular impressive, as this is hard for me to do even with a movie, and in books they usually confuse me enough that I just give up and skim to the end to find out who wins. The action shots in this book, though, I genuinely enjoyed reading them. It was like my younger days, when I had just discovered Edgar Rice Burroughs, and I got to travel through the treetops with Tarzan, except of course that the action that Joe Ledger sees is a good bit less jolly than that seen by Tarzan."}, {"userName": "Akira Watts", "userReviewDate": "Jan 27, 2015", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/8158221-akira-watts", "userReview": "Reaching the point of diminishing returns with this series."}, {"userName": "Kate", "userReviewDate": "Sep 16, 2016", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/9126167-kate", "userReview": "I love the Joe Ledger books!

Surely nothing can surprise him now. At least that\u2019s what he thinks.After rescuing American college students held hostage in Iran, Joe is contacted with the alarming news that the Iranians want his help in locating six stolen nuclear bombs. Nukes are soon the least of Joe\u2019s problems when he\u2019s attacked by super-powered killers who are probably genetically engineered and may actually be unbeatable. Certainly, it\u2019s the first time he\u2019s been told to \u201crun away\u201d when he calls Mr. Church for orders. The mysterious assassin Violin, with her mommy issues, adds an intriguing element that I liked, although her name made me snicker. Whose side is she really on? Toss in the mysterious Book of Shadows together with an age-old Holy Inquisition* that\u2019s gone off the rails and you\u2019ve got a fast-paced thriller with the usual slight touch of science needed to make us wonder \u201ccould it happen\u2026\u201d As usual Joe is sarcastic but has the heart of a warrior so he never quits.As always, Ray Porter IS Joe Ledger. As I\u2019ve said before, his narration is the reason I wait for the audio books instead of snapping up the printed versions. He\u2019s got a direct, blunt delivery that can go from sarcastic to heart-felt to outraged in 60 seconds. Believably. That\u2019s good because sometimes that\u2019s the way Joe\u2019s day goes.The fourth entry to the Joe Ledger series piles surprise upon surprise until there are so many moving parts you need a score card to keep up. That\u2019s ok. The ride is most of the fun anyway. It was refreshing to see Echo Team on an assignment that didn\u2019t involve anything supernatural or genetically engineered. It also explained why Joe is sometimes incredulous about the strange situations in which he becomes embroiled. He\u2019s so deep into rescuing college kids that he just plain forgets about his first zombie killing assignment.Yeah right.That excuse doesn\u2019t really work for the many times that people who should know better protest, \u201cWhat? Supernatural? That\u2019s just crazy!\u201d That really is the weakest part of these stories. Shouldn\u2019t Echo Team be surprised if there isn\u2019t a monster or super-villain somewhere in the shadows?This was a return to the Joe Ledger adventure style of the first book in a way, which I liked very much. It also satisfactorily tied up some loose ends that had been accumulating through the last book or two. Highly recommended for those who enjoyed the previous books.NOTE: This book was originally reviewed for SFFaudio.* Catholics needn\u2019t worry.

I\u2019m a huge fan of this series, and have loved every one, so I was eager to dive back into Joe\u2019s world. The day after Joe and Echo Team rescue a group of college students held hostage in Iran, Joe is sitting in a coffee shop with a laser sight trained on his groin. He gets a call and a mysterious female voice gives him very specific instructions to meet a man in the coffee shop. It\u2019s not like he has much choice. I mean, there are laser sights trained on his, er, man parts! Just a day in the life of our man Joe, yes? Trouble tends to follow Joe around, and he\u2019s about to discover just what kind of trouble has found him, and it\u2019s the worst yet\u2026Poor Joe. The author really puts him through the ringer in this one, physically and emotionally. A particularly nasty blast from Joe\u2019s past is on the loose, vampires are running amok, an ancient order is bent on destruction, nuclear bombs are in the hands of mad men, and Joe can\u2019t catch a break. Seriously, Joe is constantly fighting in this one, and it seems no place is safe. His loyal dog Ghost is always at his side, and even Ghost is run ragged. I think one thing I really love about Joe is that he\u2019s willing to do what needs to be done, even if things get a bit unpleasant, and yet, all the while, he fights with himself, with the Warrior within who craves the fight. This struggle just makes an almost superhuman man seem more human and never fails to make me like him more. Of course Joe has the support of the DMS, and his boss, Mr. Church on his side, but he also acquires some unlikely allies, my favorite being in the form of a lethal assassin that calls herself Violin. I\u2019m sincerely hoping we\u2019ll see more of her in future books.Assassin\u2019s Code is mainly told in Joe\u2019s voice, but there are Interludes and passages where the narrative takes us back to the 9th century, and the history behind an ancient, terrifying pact. Also, we get a bit of insight into the other players in the book. I\u2019ll admit, while I enjoyed these passages, I was always eager to get back to Joe, Ghost, and Echo Team as they race to find the nukes and get the baddies. And the baddies in this one are really, really bad, and nearly take Joe down for the count, more than once. Maberry\u2019s fight scenes are action packed, exciting, and written so well, I never had trouble picturing what was going on; Joe\u2019s trademark snark is on full blast here (it will make you laugh, even when the bullets-stakes, holy water, garlic, etc-are flying), and the core of humanity that is ever present in these books is always just beneath the surface, even when you think things have gotten that bad. Things do get bad in this one, very bad, but have faith in Joe. When has he ever let us (or the world) down? The series just gets better and better, and I read Assassin\u2019s Code in big gulps, frequently losing track of time.

Well I can answer that question and it is yes! Although the other 3 were 5 stars and were most excellent, this one went a step further I think. I am not usually one for military, terrorism and the like, so when and author can make me like reading about those things, then he has a great talent! This series revolves around terrorism in one form or another. Each book is a different form and they just keep getting better, rich in imagery and great plot lines.I have to talk about the things I like best about this book, or actually any of the books. First would be the characters. They are all so rich in realism, so believable and brilliantly created. The Echo Team consists of so many great, unforgettable characters. Of course most people who know me would know by now who my favorite character is, but just in case there is a question about it, I will tell you. Joe! He is now my favorite character EVER! And that is saying a lot. Because I have read a lot of books, and met a lot of great characters. Move over Roland, Joe is in the forefront now. What I love most about Joe is his flawed character. It makes him superbly believable and I love that. Joe is the kind of guy that takes all those mistakes, all his fears and all his past failures and triumphs and he uses it to drive him forward. He is the kind of guy that never gives up. And when I say never I mean never. He is also witty and sarcastic and he loves those people in his life like family and would do what it takes to protect them. He lives with 3 personalities in his head, Cop, Warrior, and the Civilized man. And he learned to control them and use them appropriately.The next thing I love about this book/series is the amount of action that is in the book. It was just about non stop through all of them. A lot of what happens you don't quite expect, pair that with the great plot twists and you have an exciting, unforgettable story. I would have to recommend this book to everyone. I think everyone should jump aboard and form their own relationship with Joe. Because once you do, you will never forget the ride."}, {"userName": "Tad", "userReviewDate": "Feb 14, 2012", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/4021265-tad", "userReview": "Assassin\u2019s Code: A Joe Leger Novel is a fast-paced thriller with a slightly paranormal edge. Joe Ledger is an engaging hero. He is tough, but not superhuman, with a wise-cracking sense of humor, a split personality and a scarred pysche. Along with the team Joe commands is his dog, Ghost. I worried that the dog would either be a throwaway character or would otherwise be distracting. Instead, Ghost was a solid character in his own right, and an effective foil for Joe in what might otherwise be interior monologues.Assassin\u2019s Code is not a conventional thriller, it is a little over the top and a bit fantastical. But in a tremendously entertaining way. The plot involves stolen nukes, ancient shadowy organizations that date back to the Crusades, and vampires. Put it all together and you wind up with a page-turning thriller that holds your attention from beginning to end and leaves you wanting more. Jonathan Maberry is a skilled writer with a great imagination. I wasn\u2019t even finished reading this book before I\u2019d ordered more books in the series. This was my first time reading this author and this series. Reading the earlier books may have given me a deeper appreciation of the characters, but it read fine as a stand alone book.

All the usual pieces of the Joe Ledger series are present in this fourth book: international intrigue, tough guy dialogue, vaguely supernatural bad guy, and a whole lot of punching. I don't know if it's because the series is starting to feel a little threadbare or because Maberry just hit a fallow patch, but not much here works. Even the premise \u2013 vampires have nukes! \u2013 feels strained. There's some good stuff (especially the discovery of Arklight, an all-female group of assassins), but the usually sharp dialogue feels clunky, the humor is forced, and the book spends way too long on setup and not enough on payoff. There's also some quasi-Anne Rice foolishness where the main narrative is interrupted to cut back in time several hundred years to reveal how the vampires were created.

He has help from an outside source that he's not sure what to think of, as well as his dog, Ghost. And the threat this time is more deadly and immediate than any he has faced so far with the DMS. The bad guys are sufficiently creepy (enough to scare the pants off Joe), and they seem to be coming from all sides. There are some recurring charcters in this one.

The older I got the more I understood and appreciated the fact that some monsters are all too human and all too often battling these monsters would change people. They were battles worth fighting, but fighting and winning them comes with a cost. When I find a story that can combine that youthful feeling of excitement with the grit and realism of stories that mean something and matter I devour that story. When you find an author who delivers those types of stories on a regular basis you find yourself eagerly awaiting that author\u2019s next book. Jonathan Maberry is just such an author. IIn the previous three novels of his Joe Ledger series he\u2019s given readers exciting tales of highly trained soldiers that battle human and man made scientific monsters and the price they pay for doing that duty. In his latest novel, \u201cAssassin\u2019s Code,\u201d the fourth in the Ledger series, Maberry takes his soldiers one step further into the darkness as they come up against mythic and possible supernatural monsters. The result is the best novel in the series so far.\u201cAssassin\u2019s Code\u201d kicks off in media res and dumps both readers and Joe Ledger into a tense situation. Ledger and his fellow soldiers in Echo Team are in Iran looking for an escape route after accomplishing a successful mission to free some American hikers that the Iranian government has taken hostage. While Ledger is laying low a high ranking member of Iranian Intelligence ambushes him and forces him into a clandestine meeting where he delivers some shocking news; an unknown enemy has rigged several oil fields with nuclear bombs. Ledger and his team must discover who this enemy is and stop the bombs from being detonated before it\u2019s too late.From there the novel takes off like a rocket. The pacing in \u201cAssassin\u2019s Code\u201d is breath taking. Pacing is something Maberry has always been good at, but I think this is his most exhilaratingly paced novel yet. The main action of the story occurs over the course of only about two days and much of those days are spent running with Joe Ledger as he tries to stay away from a horde of enemies, or with the command and support staff of the Department of Military Sciences, the clandestine organization Leger works for, as they try to decipher the clues to the mystery of what they\u2019re facing. There are some flashbacks that take place months, and even centuries earlier but they are useful and shocking revelations that only heighten the enjoyment of the story.Speaking of revelations, now we come to spoiler territory. Let\u2019s see if I can dance around it. The primary enemies that Ledger, Echo Team, and the DMS face in \u201cAssassin\u2019s Code\u201d are an ancient order of assassins known as the Red Order. Much of the novel is spent trying to determine what the members of the Red Order are and if they are products of the supernatural or some weird offshoot of science. Maberry does an excellent job handling the revelations surrounding the Red Order. With the ending of the last Ledger book, \u201cThe King of Plagues\u201d and some of the developments in this one, especially those surrounding a returning villain from \u201cThe King of the Plagues,\u201d it feels like Maberry is guiding his readers into the deep end of the supernatural pool. He\u2019s doing it in the same expert way John Connelly did with his Charlie Parker series of novels. It\u2019s exciting to see.Since we\u2019re on the topic of the supernatural fans of Maberry\u2019s \u201cPine Deep\u201d trilogy of novels will appreciate a fun little Easter Egg that links the trilogy to the Ledger novels. It\u2019s the second of such links (the first being a fun short story titled \u201cMaterial Witness\u201d that is available for download.) I look forward to a later meeting by the survivors of the Pine Deep novels and the members of the DMS.Character wise, \u201cAssassins Code\u201d is a great mix of old and new cast members. As usual, Maberry gives readers plenty of time inside the scarred, but noble psyche of his protagonist, Joe Ledger. He also gives us some more clues into the past of the most intriguing supporting character in the Ledger series, the enigmatic Mister Church. Echo Team doesn\u2019t get as much time in this installment as previous novels, but you do get to know their three newest members a little more; Khalid Shaheed, Lydia Ruiz, and most importantly my favorite the sniper of few words, John Smith. You also get some time with some reoccurring villains (no spoilers here either!) One becomes a bigger character you love to hate, one has a surprising transformation, and one becomes even more frightening and mysterious.In terms of new characters we\u2019re given a host of intriguing ones in the form of two rival organizations. The first is a team of all female warriors and assassins known as Arklight, who Mister Church has a mysterious connection with. Their chief operative in the story is a woman known as Violin that assists Ledger throughout the story and has some pretty interesting chemistry with him. The second is the dangerous and powerful Red Order and their leader, Grigor, a bloodthristy and hateful man who has dubbed himself the King of ThornsWhen Grigor and his enemies come up against Joe Ledger and his allies the results are some pretty powerful and exciting action scenes. Those of you who have read my previous reviews of the Ledger novels know how much I love Maberry\u2019s action scenes, particularly the ones involving hand to hand combat. \u201cAsssassin\u2019s Code\u201d is packed with those. There are several stand out brutal and vicious fights that really test Joe Ledger\u2019s mettle as a character. Lately, I\u2019ve been reading Jack Kirby\u2019s work on Marvel Comics \u201cBlack Panther\u201d series and one of the reasons why Kirby was called \u201cThe King of Comics\u201d was because of the visceral and powerful ways he brought to life action scenes. The action scenes in the other Ledger novels and especially \u201cAssassin\u2019s Code\u201d are a pretty good argument for dubbing Maberry \u201cThe Jack Kirby\u201d of prose.The action, characters, plot, and pacing, all combine together for Maberry\u2019s most satisfying Joe Ledger novel to date. The ending of the book really kept me guessing and ended on several very cool notes. The epilogue wraps up several things and also sets the stage for the next Ledger novel, which I eagerly await."}, {"userName": "Leeuwer", "userReviewDate": "Jan 13, 2018", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/9496421-leeuwer", "userReview": "Holy shit! What if Jason Statham starred in The Da Vinci Code and fought a vampire army to save the world from nuclear annihilation? If the previous novel was a bit low on the action, this is a MASSIVE counter by Maberry. Joe gets the shit beaten out of him and kicks more ass than any action hero on the big screen. Reading these novels you can't help but wonder if Maberry is going to burn the novelty and inspiration on this material, but somehow he keeps on delivering."}, {"userName": "Reanne", "userReviewDate": "Feb 05, 2015", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/5508082-reanne", "userReview": "[It was an appropriate ending for him.

I\u2019ve took a break from Joe and Echo team because I thought the books were getting a little predictable\u2026 and you know what\u2026 taking a break did not change that. Still, it isn\u2019t that bad. I have always thought of Joe Ledger and Echo Team as a guilty pleasure\u2026 light reading\u2026 I can\u2019t even swear to you that I won\u2019t try to read another\u2026 I just don\u2019t think I can take it seriously anymore."}, {"userName": "Jeff Miller", "userReviewDate": "May 13, 2013", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/3947630-jeff-miller", "userReview": "The Joe Ledger books are like the summer blockbuster with lots of action and doomsday plots and multiple hidden organizations competing against each other. They also have some depth to them in the characterization of Ledger who is a bit more than the action star. In fact the hero seems to be self-consciously aware of portrayal of the action star killing people and emitting one-liner.One problem when you have a series a books each trying to top each other with the next doomsday scenario that must be stopped is that they can get more outlandish. I felt this was the case in this book. Previous books in the series mainly had high-tech bad guys crafting zombies viruses, bio-engineering etc. So semi-plausable science fiction that you can easily play along with.The plot of this one annoyed me a bit. Mainly because just once I would like to see a thriller that mentions the Crusades, the Inquisition, Saladin, etc that actually had some historical idea of what they were talking about. Here we had basically a B-Movie horror plot element plot combined with some Dan Brown-like idiocy. Secret assassin groups that have survived for centuries with semi-Church approval. Sure I have no problems with inventive plot elements even highly-unlikely ones in a book of this type. Yet his mixture here did not gel for me and I admit it is mostly because there is just so much historical ignorance along these lines. That combined with some relativism along religious lines did not help or that the \"staunch\" and \"devout\" Catholic character apparently had no problem with fornication.Regardless I still enjoyed it for what it was."}, {"userName": "Chris", "userReviewDate": "Dec 02, 2012", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/1448151-chris", "userReview": "In this fourth installment of the Joe Ledger series, the world is threatened by an ancient conspiracy of violence and deception, with the DMS caught up in a race to find not one, but several nukes planted in various key oil fields. (Mild spoilers ahead!) But that is only the tip of the global iceberg. After Ledger is contacted by a high-ranking Iranian official while in-country during a rescue mission in Tehran, he's given vital intel on the nuke's location, along with help from a beautiful and mysterious assassin. Ledger and Echo Team must race against the clock to unravel the plot and stop the nukes from detonating.But there's a wrinkle. There's vampires. Not the heart-throbbing sparkly kind, thank goodness. The upierczi are nasty and deadly, with a horrifyingly believable twist on the blood-sucking legend of old. Maberry keeps the plot and action brisk, interspersed with adequate backstory to fill in the historical gaps. If you haven't read these novels, you're really missing out on some of the best, most enjoyable series in modern fiction, period.

I think Maberry took some risks that paid off (and some that didn't but they were few) and overall wrote a book that engaged me quickly, stayed true to the overall series while moving it forward, and basically was just a lot of fun. I love Violin and the whole Arklight group and I really hope we see more of them. Since I don't think Joe and Violin will work out long term, well, this is a perfect character to crossover into Pine Deep and I'd kill to see a Mike/Violin because SO AWESOME. Also, the redemption of Toys is wonderful because for some reason I liked him even when he was an evil minion (perhaps his loyalty?) and I really want to see more of Toys especially since I hear book #6 is a direct sequel to book #1. Definitely a fun read and one I will probably re-read again."}, {"userName": "Bogdan", "userReviewDate": "Oct 15, 2014", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/2537876-bogdan", "userReview": "Desi am sarit peste volumul 3 al seriei, fara intentie, nu am simtit vreo problema la lectura.Din cate am inteles din context, \"bad guy\"-ul din 3 apare si acum urzind niscaiva comploturi incrincenate.Daca pina acum Maberry s-a folosit de zombie, clone si ceva mutanti, de data asta apar in prim plan vampirii.Este o serie cu tot felul de comploturi posibile daca ar fi sa scoatem din discutie elementul supranatural, desi influenta geneticii asupra evolutiei \"vampirilor\" nu as spune ca e chiar asa de sf.Actiune, adrenalina si niste dialoguri \"antrenante\" recomanda seria oricarui fan de asa ceva."}, {"userName": "Tony", "userReviewDate": "Apr 20, 2012", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/382274-tony", "userReview": "The 4th in the Joe Ledger/DMS series by Jonathan Maberry.
