Thus, I rejoiced at the idea of the Untold Tales, where she takes us into the lives of different characters prior to their appearance in the original series. In this volume, we get familiar with the stories of Lydia, Monica and Eric. Lydia is a significant character in the whole trilogy. Even though she is dead from the start, she has a huge influence on Katie's thoughts and decisions. She's the reason for Katie's unrelenting determination and strength, not only to survive, but to rebuild, to love again. I loved finding out what exactly happened in her final moments, as well as getting a glimpse at their previous lives together. It was truly bittersweet. As for Juan's cousin, Monica, she is a character I felt I never really got to know, so it was great to get a sense of who she is. Even though these stories are short, they're definitely still intense, with an abundance of emotion.Eric's story is quite a bit longer. He is also a character that, although present quite a bit, I craved to know even more about. What he went through before the fort is terrifying; we see him struggle with heartbreak, loneliness, and of course, zombies. I feel like I know him SO much more - so much so that a re-read of this series is forthcoming! Additionally, Eric's story is filled with cameos of other well loved character that gave me an immense feeling of nostalgia to the point of tears. It's like there were all these precious moments that was previously missed due to all the chaos of the first days, and now we get to see it, to live it. Even if, like me, you don't generally read short stories, do not look these over - especially if you're already a fan of the As the World Dies series. They are filled with as much humor, love, horror and thrill as the full length novels. If you're new to this series, you will get to glimpse Rhiannon's impeccable talent of leaving you on the edge of your seat, while making you ADORE these characters completely. Seriously.\"Fuck you, Aliens!\""}, {"userName": "Ashley - The Bookish Brunette", "userReviewDate": "Aug 05, 2011", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/4407857-ashley---the-bookish-brunette", "userReview": "YES... Rhiannon Frater put together a collection of three short stories to go along with her As The World Dies trilogy (for all her DIE HARD fans... *ahem* that would definitely include me!)First short story was Lydia's... *sobs*Lydia is totally one of my favorite characters in the As The World Dies series... even though she is already dead at the beginning of the first book. I know right? She is such a HUGE part of Katie's memories, that we care about her as deeply as we do Katie or Jenni! When I found out that Lydia's story was in this book I could NOT get to my computer fast enough to download it! You will cry. You have been warned.Second short: *Monica*Monica is Juan's cousin and we find her making her way across Texas, after the apocalypse trying to get to her family in Ashley Oaks... Does she make it before the zombies or a fellow human gets to her?If you've read The First Days then you'd know! *Brunette taunting you*Third short: *Eric*Eric promised Brandy a romantic weekend alone... no cell phones... no TV... no computer *gasp*... So when the dead began to rise, it came as no surprise that they knew nothing about it.Eric HAD noticed people around him behaving strangely, a bit apprehensive- having strange conversations on the phone, \"Grandpa attacked the mail man?! What do you mean he BIT him?\" but Eric ignores these things to appease Brandy.After over hearing a phone call he wasn't supposed to- that had confirmed Brandy to be a lying cheater and Brandy finding out her sister had been 'bitten' the night before and was now laying in the hospital... Brandy LEAVES Eric stranded at the B&B. Nothing but him, his dog and you know... the zombies! ________________________God, NO ONE tells a story like Rhiannon Frater! I'm not usually a fan of short stories, I always end up wanting more... Yeah, I'm greedy. As The World Dies: The Untold Tales is a bit different, because I am already so deeply invested in this series and I feel so connected to the characters that I will devour anything to do with the these books! LOVED it- hardcore!Lydia and Monica's stories are really short, but no less powerful and compelling than Eric's story (which makes up the majority of this book.)"}, {"userName": "chucklesthescot", "userReviewDate": "Aug 07, 2015", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/3426724-chucklesthescot", "userReview": "The Untold Tales series is a great companion novella anthology to the As the World Dies series. I'd advise reading book one in that series before reading these stories. I'm going to write just a few comments on each story and how good each one is so I don't ruin the plot! And how gorgeous is the cover of this book? I love the colours and design.1) The Broken HeartAs Katie rushes off to get to court on time, her wife Lydia is at home, getting worried about the strange behaviour of her blood covered neighbour. What has he done to his wife?Even in this short story I knew that Lydia is a character that I would have loved-certainly much nicer than Jenni! It is tougher to read this short story because you already know the outcome if you have read The First Days, but it is a great addition to this book.2) Dangerous HighwaysMonica has decided it is time to leave her boyfriend and then the zombie apocalypse hits, leaving her alone on the road, trying to find gas and safety, when zombies are on the prowl.This was a decent background story, telling what dangers Monica faced in the early days of the zombie apocalypse.3) Vacation of the UndeadEric is on vacation with his gold digger girlfriend who he wants to marry and his beloved dog Pepe. When Brandy decides she is leaving, Eric is left alone at the property with only internet contact with a survivor at a compound to keep his spirits up. But should he try to find other survivors or hide where he is? The choice is about to be taken out of his hands.This was a good story, though I wanted to hit Eric for being a doormat, and throttle Brandy for being the bimbo bitch from hell! I liked all the levels of the story and the way Eric discovers the fort and the possibility of a new life-if he can get there. Good story!Overall I enjoyed this volume of stories. I have bought the other two in the series but don't plan to read them until I finish the As The World Dies trilogy. I look forward to reading them all soon."}, {"userName": "Jenne ", "userReviewDate": "Jul 21, 2013", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/5705914-jenne", "userReview": "So this is 3 short stories from the first days of the zombie outbreak. I wish I'd of read it closer to finishing the series. It took me a minute to remember who was who. Still good and I really liked Eric's POV the best. My favorite zombie books are the early days of the ZA. Lydia's story:This one is the selling point of the book since Lydia is such a presence throughout the series. It was just way too short. I kinda felt cheated lol. Monica's story: I'd forgotten what a tough cookie Monica is. She wasn't afraid to take care of business lol\u2026especially in this one!Eric's story:This one was my favorite and it was the longest. Poor guy finds out his \"I'm about to propose to you\" significant other is cheating on him and has the ZA break out all in one day. Eric had more sense than anyone else he was around at the B&B. Especially his spoiled girlfriend. We also get a tie in to the fort where Jenny & Katie are."}, {"userName": "Aoife", "userReviewDate": "Feb 03, 2014", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/16768476-aoife", "userReview": "I love this book! It brought back all the memories of what I felt when I was first introduced to Jenni and Katie's world and I wanted to go and read the whole trilogy again.This book and the other volumes that follow, give us an insight into the tale that very few authors give to the readers that enter their world. A small look into the lives and thoughts of other characters, not central in the plot line but important enough that they made an impact on us. Like Lydia, who was always the tragic beauty, who we wish could have been saved. Eric and Stacey, who managed to find love in a time where love and hope was scarce. I finished it, craving the next! Any fan of As the World Dies, should purchase these books. They are not a disappointment but just exceed the expectations you didn't even know you had!"}, {"userName": "Hayat", "userReviewDate": "Dec 07, 2014", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/6116230-hayat", "userReview": "Once again Ms Frater has hit the nail on the head! I loved getting to know what happened to some of the characters from the main story and their friends and loved ones. The untold tails of the desperate survivors (and the unlucky ones) was exciting, scary, sad, disturbing, heart-warming and at times darkly humorous. The only down side is that the short story on what happens on the first day to Katie\u2019s beloved wife (Lydia) was a bit too short. I would've loved for there to have been more on this story. But on the whole, I'm very happy with this volume of Untold Tales of the series called As the World Dies.

You can never go wrong with a Rhiannon Frater book!"}, {"userName": "Carolyn  Storer", "userReviewDate": "Oct 10, 2011", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/2449271-carolyn-storer", "userReview": "Originally posted on Book Chick City. 7/10 on the blog.I don't often read short stories. Not because I don't think they are good but because I prefer the longer story and character arc that a novel can give. But when I found that one of my all time favourite series had a companion volume of short stories, I had to read it. I'm not sure if readers coming in as a completely new reader will find this small collection of short stories as riveting as I did. The first two stories are short and I think were written for readers already familiar with the 'As The World Dies' trilogy. Because I had read the first two novels in the series, I was able to read the short stories with a mind already full of the world and the characters and the groundwork and foundations had already been set so to speak. However, as a companion to the trilogy they are fab.The Broken Heart ~ Lydia's StoryThis was the story I was most looking forward to reading, as well as dreading. Katie, one of the main characters in the full length novels in the 'As The World Dies' trilogy is such a wonderful character. Her sorrow and pain she feels about the death of her beloved wife, Lydia, is really poignant and one of the reasons I love Katie so much, so to finally see how Lydia died is sad but a must read all the same. It was lovely to see Katie and Lydia together in happier times, good to see Katie smiling and buoyant rather than fighting for her life and tormented by memories of Lydia as a zombie. But at the same time the ending to Lydia's story is inevitable, we know what happens, and it's this ending that is so sad and heartbreaking, but very fitting to the trilogy and Katie's ongoing story.Dangerous Highways ~ Monica's StoryIt was nice to see Monica's journey before she arrived at the Fort. Not a pleasant journey by any means having been threatened at gun point by a man who had lost his sanity with hungry zombies all around. After seeing his wife being bitten and turned into a zombie and then see her kill and turn their children into zombies, you can understand why he's gone a little bit loopy.But this is a different world now and it boils down to survival. Monica has to do what she can to stay alive so she can get to her home town and her family in one piece. As with all of Frater's work, there's an abundance of tension and suspense that makes this story exciting and heard to put down. But because it's very short, you don't have to wait long before it's ended - far too short in my opinion, but a great little story.Vacation of the Undead ~ Eric's StoryI didn't find Eric particularly charismatic in 'Fighting to Survive'. He was a bit weedy. But this short story, which is a much better length, changed all that. Eric is actually pretty cool.This short story is Eric's journey to the Fort and what a journey it is. After a huge fight with his girlfriend, Brandy, Eric finds himself, and his little dog, Pepe, in a bed and breakfast with zombies shuffling outside the front door. Before he enters the Fort we see him fighting off hordes of zombies, saving lives and falling in love.The first half of the story seems to have been influenced by the novel, 'I Am Legend' by Richard Matheson. Although Matheson's novel deals with vampires rather than zombies, there are many similarities; a male character, who thinks he's all alone in a post-apocalyptic world, barricades himself inside a house, drinks himself into a stupor on a daily basis in despair, who owns a dog...However, despite these similarities, Frater puts her distinct stamp on Eric's Story. Her ability to draw you into the action, of which there is plenty, to captivate you with her descriptive prose, to capture your heart with endearing characters, is now a definitive Frater trait, and as with everything I've read by Frater so far I enjoyed it immensely.I loved the duo of Eric and his dog, Pepe. The relationship between them is sweet, and a man who loves animals is a great man indeed in my opinion. However, the human facial expressions Frater continually plasters on Pepe does become a bit unrealistic. Whether it was intended to be how Eric interprets his dogs behaviour is unclear. However, the love Eric has for his little dog is one of the reasons I like him so much, and a love I can totally understand. I heart animals.I was surprised at how strong, capable and dynamic Eric became throughout this short story. He grew in my estimations and transformed into a sort of unwitting hero. Now that I have a better understanding of who he is, I hope he has a larger role to play in, 'Siege', the third novel in the trilogy.VERDICT:I LOVED 'The First Days' and 'Fighting to Survive' - they will both go down as two of my all time favourite zombie horror novels *I can't wait to read 'Siege'. When I began reading this volume of short stories I was instantly pulled back into the zombie infested world Frater had created in her full length novels and I didn't want it to end. As this is a self-published work there are a few editing issues and some repetition, but Frater's writing talent shines through and these small issues soon became insignificant.'As The World Dies Untold Tales' is a great insight into some of the lesser known characters, but Lydia and Monica's stories were not long enough for my liking, but that's probably just because I love this world so much. A wonderful companion to the 'As The World Dies' trilogy. I hope there's a volume two."}, {"userName": "Ann Bickle", "userReviewDate": "Aug 02, 2017", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/39199923-ann-bickle", "userReview": "I really love the series by Rhiannon Frater...and these short stories of the characters I love were fun to read."}, {"userName": "Betty", "userReviewDate": "Jan 16, 2018", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/9385032-betty", "userReview": "I want more Eric and Stacy!!!"}, {"userName": "Amy Fournier", "userReviewDate": "Mar 06, 2012", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/5943163-amy-fournier", "userReview": "I have a few blogger friends who absolutely swear that I need to read the As The World Dies series. After reading this I am totally going to. This book goes into the stories of some of the characters in the series, who as the title states, stories are untold. I have gotten to know some of the characters through their own stories and I need read more about everything having to do with this series. Rhiannon Frater sure knows how to do the whole zombie thing. It's intense, creepy, and totally addictive. She grabs a hold of you and pulls you right in. Each of the three stories in this book are amazing and really makes you feel how they are feeling. The first story is Lydia's story called Broken Heart. Lydia and her wife Kate are getting ready for work and going about their normal morning routine. They are a bit bothered by the news about the riots, but don't really think about it. You can tell how much they love each other and it's really sweet. Their neighbor has been infected and Lydia sees first hand what is happening, and it's not just riots. The final pages of this story were very intense. The next story in the book is Monica's story called Dangerous Highways. I will start off my saying that I freaking love Monica! She is totally badass, and super brave. She has a huge friggin monster truck (which works great for running over zombies) and she has a gun. The story starts with her syphoning gas from an abandoned vehicle that has been crashed. There are crazy psycho zombie children in the back of it, but she is getting her gas and then she's back on the road. Well apparently there was a survivor out of the vehicle and he is one scared mo-fo. I mean to the point that he is absolutely in a panic and doesn't even want help. He's friggin nuts after watching his family all get zombiefied. I won't tell you what happens, but I will say I need to read The First Days (book 1 in the As The World Dies series) because I want to learn more about this chick for sure!!The last story in the book, and also the longest is Eric's story called The Vacation of the Undead. Eric is a pretty wealthy average guy who has a super hot model girlfriend. She is superficial, snobby, spoiled, and just really unlikable. I just want to smack him for even being with her. So they are on a vacation at a bed and breakfast because Brandy feels neglected. She wants his full attention, no phone, no Internet, no TV, nothing. He happens to catch a bit of the news when he is at the front desk and hears about the \"riots\" he is a little unsettled about it, but tries to shrug it off to make Brandy happy. She is already pissed that he happened to watch some TV for a minute. *rolls eyes* She ends up on the phone one night and finds out that her sister is in the hospital because she got hurt during the riots. We all know obviously she is going to be zombiefied right? She ends up leaving to go to her sister, leaving Eric behind. Eric and his little dog Pepe find out about the Zombies and decide to hole up at the bed and breakfast. There is some food, and a gun so they have protection. They have an escape plan in place in case they need it. All goes well for a while, but of course the zombies make it there. He goes on the run with some new allies and they try to make it to a fort they heard about. This story is truly intense reading about their close calls and how they are trying to survive. Will they make it to the fort and escape the zombies? I'll never tell. These stories, while all very different, are all about trying to survive. The zombies are gruesome and creepy, and the people need to learn to be tough if they want to live. There is no gloss over on this. It is graphic and awesome! You want a good zombie book, this is it. It's jut some of the untold stories of the characters, but I now know I have to read the As The World Dies series. I have had a taste of Rhiannon's work and need more now. 5 out of 5 stars!!"}, {"userName": "Laura Thomas", "userReviewDate": "Feb 21, 2012", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/7491783-laura-thomas", "userReview": "For those of you who haven\u2019t read the As The World Dies Trilogy or even volume one, The First Days, never fear. These three tales only tell us a small part of what is occurring in The First Days and mainly focuses on a few characters, spotlighting them and giving them their due.The Broken Heart (Lydia\u2019s Story)Lydia, Katie\u2019s wife, is already dead in the beginning of the series, but even in death she steals the hearts of fans. This is her story.It\u2019s a perfect dawn and Lydia is enjoying her morning tea, letting Katie sleep in. Screams from across the lake interrupt the quiet, giving her the willies. But as they don\u2019t continue she puts it from her mind. She doesn\u2019t know it yet, but this will be the last normal morning they share.This is in the beginning, before the world dies and zombies are everywhere.The companionship and closeness of these two really made me smile. I knew the outcome wasn\u2019t going to be rosy, but I enjoyed getting to know Katie and Lydia and was so wrapped up in their story I forgot for a while that this was going to end badly. Such is the excellent writing of Rhiannon Frater. My first taste of it and craving more.Dangerous Highways (Monica\u2019s Story)This short story takes place between The First Days and Fighting To Survive.Monica is alone now. She manages to escape El Paso thanks to her dead boyfriends pistol and trusty monster truck. She keeps an eye on the undead kids in the station wagon as she siphons gas to put in her tank.She\u2019s leaving the memory of his death behind her, like a dust plume behind the truck. Heading to her home town of Ashley Oaks, Texas and her cousin Juan.She doesn\u2019t know if the town is overrun or even still standing but that\u2019s her plan. She knows how to kill the zombies thanks to all of the movies she\u2019s watched. But that doesn\u2019t make it any easier. It\u2019s a whole other ball game when you come face to face with the unbelievable in real life.And zombies aren\u2019t the only thing she has to fear. As a woman traveling alone, Monica knows full well the dangers of encountering strangers.I really like Monica. She\u2019s rough and tough, takes care of business, and makes hard decisions with no hesitation. I could only hope to be half as tough as her.The Vacation of the Undead (Eric\u2019s Story)This a quite a bit longer than the first two tales.Eric is staying at a bed and breakfast with his supermodel girlfriend, Brandy, and his best friend, Pepe, a Jack Russell Terrier.Eric is wondering if he\u2019s really in love with Brandy, or in love with the idea of her. She\u2019s excellent eye candy on his arm, but she\u2019s not really a nice person. Her true colors come out when the apocalypse begins.Eric may come across as a bit of a nerd, but he\u2019s smart and has a big heart. He\u2019s also a dog lover and Pepe will steal your heart. Whenever a pet is introduced into a story, it becomes more real to me. It\u2019s strange that we become so upset if harm comes to an animal, and take it in stride sometimes when it\u2019s a human. I guess it\u2019s their innocence and trust that does it.I would like stories with animals in them to start with a disclaimer: No animals were harmed in the writing of this story. I\u2019m not spoiling it when I say Pepe\u2019s tail is still wagging, as he appears in The First Days and Fighting To Survive.Rhiannon\u2019s characters are brought to life and fleshed out in these three untold tales and reading these in no way spoiled it for me as I haven\u2019t read the series YET.I got to know them, like or dislike them, fear for them and cheer for them. Now that I\u2019ve experienced the author\u2019s writing, been sucked into her world, I have to know more. Have to know everything.I received this book for my honest review. My review is in no way influenced and I'm looking forward to more in this exciting series."}, {"userName": "Loretta", "userReviewDate": "Apr 26, 2012", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/4148907-loretta", "userReview": "Posted here: http://www.betweenthepagesreviews.com...I love that Rhiannon Frater wrote these short books that include some characters in the books you really do not get to learn about. Now you do, and I thought Vol. 1 was a great addition to read after reading the 1st book in the As The World Dies series The First Days. You will get to learn more about Lydia, Monica and Eric.One of the characters that I really loved in The First Days that you don't really get to \"know\" about is Lydia. So I was ecstatic to read and learn about her!! I felt very strongly about her while reading The First Days, even though she was not really in the story, because she is of course dead. By the hands a zombie. After reading about Lydia, and now knowing what happened on that day, my heart is even more broken for Katie. My god. I am not one to cry while reading books. But, that little story about her touched my heart. Lydia's last word. *cries all over* You can understand more about how Katie is feeling, why she feels the way she does. Because of the love that her and Lydia had. And then for her to be taken away.. Literally I had goosebumps. We learn about Monica. Who is Juan's cousin. She is on the hunt for her family. Monica is kick ass in her huge monster truck. And she's not afraid to use it. Everything about her part in this short story was great. I love how I can picture Rhiannon's writing. Very vivid. Monica is siphoning gas from a car that had terrifying zombie children in there. But she soon realizes that there is a survivor. This survivor has lost all his marbles though. Watching his family turn into zombies was just to mush for him.You will learn about Eric. He is taking his girlfriend who is also a bitch, on a vacation, along with the dog pepe, that she ungratefully didn't want any more. This is a time for them to be together without all of the distractions in the world now. TV, Phone, Cable, Internet. After hearing Brandy on the phone one night he learns more about his, bitch of a girlfriend, and what she has been doing, he also learns that these riots he heard about are not just simply riots. After Brandy's sister was attacked she decides to leave. Even though Eric is pleading with her to not go.. UMMMM HELLO STUPID GIRL. ZOMBIES ARE OUT THERE!! Of course this know-it-all fancy smancy girl is not listening to no one. She makes the decision they are leaving, only to leave Eric and pepe behind, stranded. At this point I literally called her every freaking horrible name I could think of.. After some major close zombiefied calls. He meets some people who are in search for a safe place they heard about. The fort. Making it there in one piece is the only thing they need to worry about. Will Eric and his new friends make it to Ashley Oaks human?Rhiannon Frater knows how to write a book. Whether it is a full length novel, or a short story like this. She knows how to create something that will pull you in, completely. Even if you do not like reading short stories, I suggest if you are reading the As The World Dies series you should read these!! They are just as amazing as the full length novels, and they give so much more to the series. Filling in the missing pieces of the characters, and making you fall more in love with this zombie infested world, full of strong amazing characters, who will do whatever they need to do to live. Survive. Rhiannon Frater is amazing.

For more, visit me at www.camillepicott.com.*I am totally flipped out over Rhiannon Frater's As the World Dies trilogy. Seriously, it's been a long time since I've been this in love with a series. I go to bed at night dreaming about zombies, which I think worries my husband a little. I think the last time I was this obsessed, it was with the Hunger Games. But I can't even compare this series with The Hunger Games -- they're nothing alike. I'm just about finished with the third book in thes series, which I'll post about later. In the meantime, I couldn't just read one As the World Dies book at a time -- I had to get this first collection of short stories from the same series, which features other characters from the main books. It's what I consider a crowd pleaser. If you're into the books, these stories are a blast. I wouldn't recommend reading them without reading the main series first -- they won't pack the emotional punch, IMO.Technical Craft vs Creative CraftI began thinking about the craft of writing while I was reading Frater's As The World Dies, Untold Tales Volume 1. In my opinion, there are two sides of the coin when it comes to writing: technical craft and creative craft.I define technical craft as the nuts and bolts of writing: correct spelling, punctuation, grammar, etc. I think the technical craft of writing can be mastered by anyone. Sort of like anyone can learn how to multipy and divide.The creative craft is less tangible. It's that umph factor in a book -- stellar characters, magical worlds, and rip-roaring kick-ass plot. Being a master of the Creative Craft isn't something that can necessarily be taught. I'm pretty sure Ray Bradbury or Jane Austen didn't take any Creative Writing classes. Writers like Bradbury and Austen are born with a gift. To continue with my math analogy -- I can learn how to do a certain amount of math, maybe up to algebra and geometry, but there comes a point where my brain just can't take the next step. There are a lot of typos, mis-spellings, and gramatical errors in As The World Dies, Untold Tales Volume 1. So many, in fact, that if I wasn't a die hard fan of the series, I wouldn't have finished it. But I love-love-love the characters and devoured these extra stories. For me, the Creative Craft trumped the lack of Technical Craft. This doesn't happen very often. I get annoyed when I see lots of typos and errors -- it distracts me from enjoying the story. I was surprised to find myself so engrossed in the world and the characters that I could ignore the typos. I think this is a tribute to Frater's natural gift for storytelling. What do other readers things about Technical Craft vs. Creative Craft? Is one more important than the other? Can one be overlooked if the other is present?

It didn\u2019t work out that way. So far I\u2019ve only read The First Days \u2014 my review can be found here \u2013 and it was brilliant, of course, just as all of Frater\u2019s work. When this blog tour hit my radar I knew I had to jump on it, even though I hadn\u2019t read the rest of the series. I\u2019m so glad I did. Volume 1 is a compilation of three short stories that fill us in on the history of three of the characters from the series. First up\u2026 Lydia\u2019s story.Lydia is a favorite character to most fans of the series even though she is dead from the start. I\u2019ve always wanted to know more about Lydia and now that wish has come true. As if I didn\u2019t mourn her enough after reading The First Days, I bawled my eyes out once again, all while screaming, \u201cNo! Get away from him! Run, Lydia, Run! Tissues are a must for this one.Next up is Monica, Juan\u2019s cousin. Her story made me cringe. Child zombies totally make my stomach flip. It\u2019s probably because I have children and I have a giant fear of not keeping them safe. It\u2019s the same reason the beginning of The First Days totally messed me up! Monica had to kill her ex-boyfriend to escape her first zombie experience. She heads in the direction of her remaining family in Ashley Oaks. Along the way she has to stop to siphon gas and runs into some trouble, both the zombie and the human kind. Does she make it out alive? Ooh, ooh.. I know the answer!Eric\u2019s story is the longest of the shorts in this first volume. He and his girlfriend are off at a B&B for a romantic weekend when shit hits the fan. They have no idea what is coming because Eric promised Brandy he would keep his phone off and watch zero television for the duration of their trip. Brandy is a total WITCH \u2013 with a capital C, if you know what I mean. I wanted her to get ripped apart before there was even a hint of apocalyptic action. I was desperate for zombies to come and take her down. Did she get overrun by a horde and make my dreams come true? You\u2019ll have to read it to find out.Rhiannon Frater quickly became my favorite author of horror after reading The First Days and her In Darkness We Must Abide series. She has a way of pulling the reader into the story and living through the terror right along with the characters, then dumping you out with your head on backwards. That\u2019s exactly what reading horror should do to a person. Reading this first volume of the Untold Tales makes me frantic to dive into Fighting to Survive!"}, {"userName": "Kristilyn (Reading In Winter)", "userReviewDate": "Mar 03, 2012", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/2902211-kristilyn-reading-in-winter", "userReview": "FTC Disclaimer: I received this book from the author in exchange for a fair and honest review. I\u2019m not sure what it is about zombies, but I had never been a fan. Maybe it\u2019s because they were just so \u2026 dull. I mean, as far as the paranormal goes, all zombies can do is walk around, grunt, moan, and bite people, turning them into zombies. I mean, vampires are usually beautiful people who can make their prey do whatever they want to and they\u2019ve lived so many years and have stories to tell. Werewolves are human most of the time and only turn into wolves on a full moon. But zombies? They\u2019ve always been just \u2018meh\u2019 for me.Now, enter Rhiannon Frater\u2019s world of zombies. If ever I thought I wasn\u2019t a fan of them, I certainly am now. In her short story collection, As the World Dies: Untold Stories, Frater tells tales so creatively that even the most adamant naysayer is bound to say they love zombies in the end.Split into two short stories and a novella, each story is about a certain zombie adventure. I was fascinated with each and every story and especially liked how Frater built the suspense as each tale was told. Both gruesome and terrifying, Frater weaves a blend of normalcy and terror that is enough to keep any reader satisfied and turning the pages. She even throws in comedy now and again, with one specific line sending me into laughing fits.(I\u2019m not going to say the line, but it\u2019s very close to the joke about how punctuation saves lives; that it\u2019s the difference between \u201cLet\u2019s eat, grandpa!\u201d and \u201cLet\u2019s eat grandpa!\u201d Gets me every time.)The first two stories, especially, had very dark and suspenseful endings, which was so welcoming to me. All of the stories had such a great build-up and even though there\u2019s not a lot of backstory going on, I still came to care for the characters. Frater writes amazing characters that it\u2019s hard not to see who we are to love and who we are to hate. The imagery in each story is also Frater\u2019s strong suit: I had only really experienced zombies in the movies (and not too many \u2014 more comedy horrors than anything else) and Frater painted her stories so well that I could vividly see them happening as pictures as I read. It was great.If you\u2019re like me and you really haven\u2019t read any zombie books, give Rhiannon Frater\u2019s short stories a try. They\u2019re short, with enough gore, humour, and suspense to keep any reader interested."}, {"userName": "Yolanda Sfetsos", "userReviewDate": "Aug 08, 2011", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/4724592-yolanda-sfetsos", "userReview": "I've read the AS THE WORLD DIES TRILOGY and absolutely loved it. I bought the two short story collections set in the same world--for my Kindle--because I wanted to know more about some of the supporting characters. I also wanted to try out my new Samsung Galaxy Note. :)This is the first Volume:The Broken Heart: The title of this story pretty much sums up how sad this tale is. I mean, it's about Lydia--Katie's wife--so right away we know that it's not going to end well. Still, it was nice to see them interacting together, and to finally see how/what happened to her that horrible morning shortly after Katie left to go to work.Very sad, but also very well written. Dangerous Highways: Yeah, another story where the title is perfect! This one's about Monica--Juan's cousin--and how she gets away from the undead. When the truck she's driving runs out of petrol, she has to siphon some, and in the process comes face to face with just how dangerous and insane the world has become. It's not just the zombies that are a real threat...I enjoyed it!The Vacation of the Undead: This happens to be the longest story in the collection, and centers around Eric and his dog Pepe. The weekend he decides to go away with his girlfriend and intends to pop the question, also happens to be when the world goes to hell.I loved this story because it gave me an insight into not just what Eric went through after the zombies started to appear, but it also showed a different angle and shed some light on the fact that this was happening all over the world. I also got a kick out of finding out just how Stacey and Eric meet, because in the trilogy they're pretty tight from the beginning. Oh, and Pepe. He's such a cutie!This was an excellent, and very tense story. I was on the edge of my seat most of the way.

I\u2019ve just finished the first and I must say I\u2019m impressed.In the first story, we meet Katie and Lydia and, in just a few brief moments, begin to understand what all the alarming news reports mean. The relationship between the two young women is heartwarming and I quickly grew to like them. is this the same Katie that stars in the trilogy? I\u2019m not sure but I hope so because I want to get to know her better.Monica\u2026now this is a woman I can really appreciate, not afraid to do what has to be done without hesitation and I love her almost immediate acceptance that the zombies are real and that she has her cousin\u2019s obsession with zombie movies to thank for her own survival. Her goal now is to reach Ashley Oaks, Texas, where she hopes to find her family but a chance meeting with Ramon might stop her in her tracks.Eric\u2019s story is a stark reminder of how isolated we would feel when, for whatever reason, we don\u2019t have access to instant communication with the outside world. It\u2019s bad enough when the cellphone gets lost or the cable gets cut off\u2026imagine if you couldn\u2019t find out what was happening even if, as in Eric\u2019s case, the disconnection is self-imposed. Still, his intentions were good and I couldn\u2019t help empathizing with him while I also wondered how he managed to become so controlled by the unpleasant Brandy. As the day unfolds, Eric will learn where his priorities must lie but, eventually, he\u2019ll find others who are also trying to survive. Ashley Oaks is the haven he and Stacey will seek but they won\u2019t make it without their stalwart companion, the loveable Pepe, who has a knack of sniffing out the zombies.

This is by far, the best zombie series out there. I don't care if you don't like zombies and think they are gross. The series is so much more than a bunch of mindless undead beings walking around trying to eat your brain out. It's about the human condition and what society will or won't do when forced out of their comfort zone and made to try and survive devastation when everything looks bleak. In the Untold Tales we get a glimpse and a back story on some of the characters from As The World Dies Series and what happened to them when all hell broke loose. In the first story we get the backstory of Katie and her wife Lydia. Lydia is dead in book 1 of AS The World Dies Series and Katie mourns her death. In the Untold Tales we find out exactly what transpired that first day and how Lydia died.Monica's story is next. Although short, it is well written and answers all your questions.The last story, which is the longest in the book, situates on Eric's story and how he, his dog Pepe, and his GF had been at a Bed and Breakfast on vacation when everything went to hell. WE find out Eric loses Brandy when she insists on trying to get to her sister. However Eric gains a friend when he helps a young girl named Stacey escape from a Zombie horde chasing her, her brother, and her father. Stacey loses her brother and father, but she and Eric manage to escape by climbing a water tower and holing up there until they are rescued by the Survivors at The Fort ( You have to read the series to find out what The Fort is.No one can tell a story like Rhiannon Frater.

Even with this very short story, I could see the love they shared for each other. You can't help but want to have a love like theirs. Even though I knew it was coming, I was devastated with what happened to Lydia, but her story was inspiring even with the short amount of time she had left. Story #2Monica was pretty badass. Another very short story but it packs one hell of a punch. She is just trying to survive, but some of the other survivors can't handle the new world they live in. So they do some crazy things. Monica, unfortunately, has to deal with one such crazy survivor, and you won't believe how that one ends. Wow. Story #3Now this is the story that you want to buy this book for. It is pretty long, which I loved after the others were so short. Eric is planning on proposing to his model girlfriend, Brandy. We learn pretty quickly how nasty Brandy can be but it's also understandable why Eric doesn't see it. Then the zombies strike and Brandy heads one way while Eric and his dog Pepe stay at the bed and breakfast they had been vacationing at. I was completely enthralled by Eric's story. He doesn't seem like the hero type. And he breaks down just like many would after the zombies come, but he does pick himself back up. He's smart. He finds a way to survive, he plans and prepares. I loved Eric and his relationship with his dog. It really brought a heartfelt element to the story. When Ashley shows up and brings Eric's life further upside down, they head out on a journey full of despair, hope, and friendship. I am so happy with how their story ended.

Although I haven't read the series yet, I really did not feel I needed to in order to enjoy this (though why you wouldn't is beyond me). The first story sucked me in from the first page where we meet the Character Kate and her wife Lydia enjoying a relaxing morning together before the hustle and bustle of the day starts. Kate is a major Character in the As The World dies series, so it was nice having a little back story before going into the book (which I will be starting very shortly in anticipation for the Siege Book Tour and Release).Next we meet Monica, whose story was the shortest but nonetheless memorable. She is desperately trying to flee the city and reach her family in the small town of Ashley Oaks.Lastly we have Brandy, Eric, and the little dog Pepe (who is a rockstar in his own right). This story is so, so good. I honestly felt like I was reading a full novel rather then just a short story, it had that much detail and character development. Eric and Brandy were on a romantic weekend when the world when to hell. Staying at a small town Bed and Breakfast they promised to follow a strict no electronics rule, unfortunately this also meant they had no warning when things started going horribly wrong.

Although you may want to have the first book, The First Days handy because once you read these you will defiantly want to read the series. The first volume has three short stories set in the As the World Dies universe. The first story is \u201cThe Broken Heart\u201d which is a very short story about the first days of the zombie outbreak; specifically it is Katie\u2019s wife Lydia\u2019s story about the way she died. It is a beautiful insight into Katie and Lydia\u2019s life and the true tragedy of Lydia\u2019s loss. The second story, \u201cDangerous Highway\u201d is Monica\u2019s story and it takes place within days of the outbreak. It is a really tragic tale of family. It really shows how differently everyone react to the fear steaming from the rising of the dead. \u201cVacation of the Dead\u201d is Eric\u2019s origin story and it is the longest story in the book, but my favorite. From the beginning, I could not help but feel sorry for Eric. At first, it was because he was in love with someone who was all wrong for him, and then of course the zombie apocalypse happens. What I really liked was how smart and prepared Eric was about the dire situation. There was also some stuff that he witness that I am sure will mean much more when I read First Days, but it does not take away from the story at all.

Each volume brings the reader right back into the devastated world created in As the World Dies. These tales not only shed light on some of the past and personalities of some of the characters we\u2019ve gotten to know throughout this series, but are also brief snapshots of a world in complete chaos. The imagery created in Frater\u2019s writing never fails to put a clear picture (often disturbing) in my mind of what the world looks like as well as the emotion of the character. Each short story is given just as much attention, detail, and priority as every one of her full length novels.I can\u2019t recommend these and the entire series enough for fans of this genre. I mean this is the epitome of zombie fiction, it simply doesn\u2019t get much better than this. From terrifying and bloody scenes of zombie carnage, to inspiring stories of survival against all odds, to heartbreaking scenes of love and sacrifice, this series has it all and more. I can\u2019t think of anything more I could ask from this series but then she goes beyond even that and adds these Untold Tales that answer questions I never even thought to ask and provides even more insight into this world and the people in it.

They were fast paced and incredibly well written, which allowed me to read through them very quickly. Although the stories aren't very long, the reader still gets a good grasp on the characters involved as well as the plot of the books - thanks to the writer's exceptional talent. Each story is filled with lots of details and vivid imagery along with a very quick pace and lots of action. Although I'm a huge horror fan, zombies aren't usually my thing (they scare me a bit) - but I have to admit that the author's knack for drawing the reader into the world she created has me hooked. Now I have to face my zombie fear and read the series.

Lydia was such an important part of Katie\u2019s life, and when we meet Katie in the first book, all we know is that Lydia was attacked by zombies. Their story is very bittersweet, and perfectly illustrates why Katie was so in love with her.Monica\u2019s story made less of an impact on me. While it was definitely creepy, I didn\u2019t feel that it was as strong as the other two.Eric\u2019s story is by far the longest, and the last one in the book. I really enjoyed seeing \u201cpre-zombie world\u201d Eric and how different he is. At the beginning of this installment he seems like such a sad-sack of a man, and one you would never see surviving for more than a few minutes in this type of situation. By the end of his story he has gone through a lot. I feel like I know him so much better than I did after reading the first two books. I felt his story was the most fleshed out of the three and my second favorite in the book.While I do feel that the text could have used another round of copyedits to fix a few minor typos, it was still a great read.

As The World Dies (Untold Tales Vol. 1 & 2) is wonderful collection of gory and horrifying stories that include characters from Frater's earlier trilogy As The World Dies. Although I haven't had the pleasure of reading the trilogy these volumes are awesome as stand alone stories. Each story gives a brief but in-depth view of characters along with some gore and action. I'm definitely going to go back and read Frater's trilogy! I loved that Frater gives a lot of attention to her characters and they're great characters! There's not many authors that can get you to really care about a character within a short story. The Broken Heart in volume 1 was my favorite story although it's extremely sad I just loved the emotion throughout it. I really love how Frater complicates each story and each character for example Debbie and Alan's relationship in the story A Terrible Moment in Volume 2. The shift in POV's really gives the story purpose with showing Debbie's point of view of her relationship with her husband (believing her husband has cheated on her with his secretary) and then showing Alan's point of view of the situation and his wife's sulking. Overall, I really enjoyed these stories and Frater's writing is great. I would definitely recommend picking up these two volumes, they're fantastic! If you're a lover of zombies you're missing out."}, {"userName": "Lorre", "userReviewDate": "Sep 24, 2013", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/6349980-lorre", "userReview": "These Untold Tales are \"the first days\" of some of the charachters in the As the World Dies trilogy.In this first volume it's Lydia, Monica and Eric's story and I loved all 3 stories!It's kinda strange how attached I've become to Lydia's charachter cause she dies in the first day so in the As the World Dies trilogy we never even meet her. So reading about her last day was great! (well, the first part anyway, not the part where she gets eaten by zombies)Monica is a fierce and determined young woman, and she still was in the frightning situation of the first day!I just loved Eric's story! In the trilogy it was mentioned that Eric and Stacey met, and fell in love, while surviving the first weeks of zombies but there were no details. So it was awesome to read how they met and fell in love! And I'm so glad Brandy didn't survive! She would've been a Blanche n\u00b02 in the Fort! Uh, one nagging bitch was enough in the Fort!"}, {"userName": "Teresa", "userReviewDate": "Nov 02, 2011", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/3415071-teresa", "userReview": "Loved this!While the writing/editing in this novella is still rather faulty, it has vastly improved from book one. The characters are much more engaging and have far better dialogue, though the conversations between Eric and Brandy leave much to be desired. From the moment we are introduced to Brandy, her future role is obvious.Eric and Pepe make a great team and it's refreshing to see the brow-beaten boyfriend evolve into a real person.I wish there had been longer sections for Juan's cousin (Sonya?) and Lydia. I would've liked to know whether Lydia was given the gift of final death. Maybe that is addressed in the next books???I really felt that Untold Tales was a huge step in elevating Frater's storytelling and I have only the highest hopes for Fighting To Survive."}], "description": "THE FIRST DAYS: AS THE WORLD DIES introduced Jenni and Katie and their harrowing journey to the makeshift fort in the Texas Hill Country.
