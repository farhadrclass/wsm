Peabody and Eve get most of the good lines in this one, although everyone is a comedian from time to time. And don't forget the drama.

Eve catches a case where a killer kidnaps, kills and then photographs young college students. And while Eve is busily off tracking down a serial killer, Roarke learns a devastating truth about his past.JD Robb continues to march on with her crazily addicting series featuring the tough as nails bitch cop, Eve Dallas and her seriously delicious billionaire husband Roarke.The mystery/slash police procedure in this book is pretty standard fare for this series. By now the character of Eve and her methods are very much established. For those who've read the other 15 book in the series, the solving of this crime and the motives behind it are quite familiar and truthfully break no new ground.However, I am compelled to give this installment five stars for several reasons:1)I thought she did a great job of making the victims extremely sympathetic. As I was reading, I actually felt sorry that these kids were dead. She painted a picture of people who were very vital while alive. Maybe it was because of their ages, but I think she took pains moreseo in this installment than in previous ones to capture this.2) Great use of recurring characters. Trueheart! goes undercover and the ending is bite your nails suspenseful. Also, Crack makes an incredibly memorable appearance in this one.3) Humor. The recurring theme of Peabody injecting information about her love life with McNabb and Eve's reactions are priceless. And i enjoy Eve's interaction with the temperamental photographer Hastings.4) Eve and Summerset have a Moment. I continue to enjoy the rather prickly respect/hate relationship these two have. I also like that Robb doesn't have them suddenly liking each other in a flash of understanding. I also love that there is the likelihood that this will never happen. But these two both love Roarke so they have some common ground and they meet on that ground every so often. This installment had some excellent meeting of the minds between these two.But most of all, the part that made this book for me was5) Roarke learning about his past. All along in this series, we've been watching as Eve learned dribs and drabs about her past. She's been remembering her horrific childhood in bits and pieces. But there has never been a real mystery about Roarke. The only thing he's tried to keep from her has been some parts of his own criminal past. But out of the blue he learns something and it is a biggie. The scenes where he first finds out, his reaction to finding out and his interactions with Eve upon finding out are absolute stand-outs. And once again we are confronted with the fact that Roarke is a stone killer. Loved his interrogation techniques when he goes back to Dublin to find out the real truth.Highly recommended."}, {"userName": "Diane", "userReviewDate": "Apr 29, 2012", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/8776988-diane", "userReview": "Portrait in Death is one of my favourites in the ID series.

More than once.Eve has a her hands full in PiD; there is a serial killer on the loose, and something is very wrong with Roarke.The murderer is killing young adults, those that are full of life, those that are good and innocent. He takes their pictures a moment after death, capturing their light. Wow, this one hit me in the feels. Robb managed to write the emotions of parents/brothers/sisters losing a loved one with such simplicity and poignancy I had tears running down my face. Someone we know is one of those family members that must face the unfathomable and boy is that scene heartbreaking.Then we have Roarke. He's gotten some unexpected news about his past and it hits him hard. He doesn't process the information well, pushing Eve away as he tries to deal with it on his own.Can I just say, I pretty much read this series for Roarke. He is perfection. Was perfection. Though I love seeing his softer side at times, he can say and do the most swoon-worthy things for his Eve, Roarke lost something for me in this one. He angsted and angsted some more. He doubted himself. He was cruel to Eve and Summerset. I know he was in pain, but my Roarke is always in control. He doesn't wallow. Now, don't get me wrong, Roarke's trials in PiD caused more tears to be shed, but somehow his EMOness just didn't suit him. Physically and emotionally hurting Eve definitely didn't suit him. Now he is only practically perfect in my eyes.Usually how much Eve annoys me or doesn't annoy me is how much I enjoy the installment. Eve was okay in this one. She has her Summerset moments which I honestly find childish and petty, but she is also growing in her marriage. She still flounders, but now she seeks advice and follows it through. She even put Roarke over her case this time. Loved that!Peabody is Peabody, but I admit the sexual innuendos are getting old.Tension was high towards the end. Though I suspected the guilty party, I wasn't absolutely positive until he/she was revealed. What I did nail though was who would be the killer's last mark and I was scared for them! Would Eve make it in time to prevent their death? I wasn't a 100% sure!

At the same time, Eve must deal with an injured Summerset as well as Roarke, who has become troubled and distant. The murder investigation is one of the weakest in the series. It progresses slowly and there it too much rehashing of evidence. It is also relatively easy to identify the killer by process of elimination. Nevertheless, the race toward the climax and resolution is very exciting and there are a couple of edge-of-your-seat moments. In contrast, the character development is excellent, especially for Roarke as he struggles to reconcile his feelings after discovering some disturbing information about his past. Roarke has always seemed to be the perfect man, so it was intriguing to see him so lost and \u2026 well\u2026 human, which only enhances his appeal. As always, the interactions between Eve and Summerset are a highlight and it is particularly gratifying to see how much they have in common both in terms of the lengths they will go to for Roarke, but also in their reactions to hospitals and Trina's torture sessions.

We got to learn so much about the intergalactic dreamboat as he dealt with his grief both in New York and his roots in the Emerald Isle. It was refreshing to see his perspective while our favorite chocolate-loving cop Eve Dallas was solving a case. Roarke is a complex man who hasn't completely given up his shady past as an extremely wealthy businessman. He has quite the technical prowess and it doesn't seem very fair when he's always lending a hand in Eve's cases, on his mega-illegal computer. Anyway, we saw a different side of Roarke and hopefully there will be more visits to Ireland to showcase his new darling family.The case was photography-heavy, considering the title was Portrait in Death. I know absolutely nothing about cameras and I couldn't care a fig about this aspect. It was also interesting that all of the victims were college age like myself and they showcased different personalities of that crowd. I didn't guess the murderer, which was nice, and the author decided to make him mentally unwell, which felt like a cop-out. These cases do apply to serial killers when they have warped view of reality instead of murdering on purpose. It seemed like a weak end but I'm glad she switched it up.Peabody is getting sassier and hopefully her detective license. I'm tired of McNab but there was a Dr. Louise sighting!

He does excellent cop work towards the end. A racy ending to its slow start; just what this novel needed. I've deliberately left out most of the murder stuff this time. I felt Roarke was the center of this book. I enjoyed the sub-plot more. Kept wanting to skip pages and read about the Ireland stuff.
