Because that's exactly how mystery shopper Shannon Jacoby met almost billionaire Declan McCormack. The second meeting isn't exactly the best either, but despite the weird encounters, Declan seems to be incredibly into Shannon. And the feeling is mutual.This series definitely has some OTT antics that either make me laugh out loud or cringe my soul out of my body, but I know I had to read the rest. It's like crack, and I can't get enough. I'm not usually a fan of the insta-love/lust trope, which I think this book kind of has (the events that occur in the first novella span two days, I think), but I think it was dealt with nicely. I have to admit I skimmed through some pages. I think the book would have been enjoyable if Declan's perspective was added in (which it was, as a bonus). Other than that, I enjoyed the first novella and the collection overall.I read this as a whole (the boxed set features the first 5 novellas in the series), so I will be reviewing the other novellas and the collection separately."}, {"userName": "Jay Bee", "userReviewDate": "Dec 28, 2014", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/37584013-jay-bee", "userReview": "I found this book on Amazon as one of their \"free books\" and decided to download it onto my Kindle as I usually find Chick-Lit to be perfect as a quick read when out and about. However, I'm surprised I made it through the book.I'm actually very surprised by the high reviews this series has gotten. Personally, I found myself skimming through some parts, especially at the beginning. It did get better towards the end and that's the only reason I finished the book. And, imagine my surprise when the book ends and I realized only a day had gone by in the characters world. Considering how little actually happened in the book, I'm betting all 4 books in the series is enough to make one complete novel.I don't know if this was just me but wow, did the author put every reference she could into the book. From plentyoffish to Honey Boo Boo, this book had it all. And I wasn't a fan."}, {"userName": "Paige", "userReviewDate": "Sep 13, 2016", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/15659576-paige", "userReview": "2.5 StarsShopping for a billionaire is a novella that can be read on it's own but does have another story that follows the same characters. While I did laugh out loud a couple of times, I mostly found myself getting a bit bogged down in the heroines inner ramblings. I found myself skimming parts and in such a short book, things get missed that way. I did stop and go back but just couldn't find a way to connect. I also wanted to like the hero but since he barely talked at all, I was really unable to have an opinion on him one way or the other. While the first meeting the two had was super cute. It quickly turned a tad too awkward for me. Then all the side characters were just as odd creating a storyline that seemed to go one way then quickly turn direction. And listening to the heroine talk to herself most of the time just really wasn't my cup of tea. This is a case in which I wanted to like the book as a whole more than I actually did even if parts of it did keep me entertained."}, {"userName": "Jen ", "userReviewDate": "Apr 26, 2015", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/5962787-jen", "userReview": "So freaking cute!

I totally underestimated this book! I walked into it thinking it was a humdrum smutty serial. I was so very wrong!! To my utter shock this is a fun witty romance, with only a couple kisses!!! It is a serial, but I am willing to forgive that, because all the parts have been released on audio already. So, no nasty waiting time for me! Hooray!!!Shannon is a sassy, snarky curvy gal!! Just the sort I adore!! I loved her from the very start. How could you not!! I found my self laughing at her antics and never wanting it to end! The whole book is from her POV, which make it essential that she have an awesome personality, which she does!!! Declan is yummy and totally into her from the start. I would love to get him in the narration, it would help me see his side of the flirtation. I am very excited to see how it will all progress in the next book.In addition to how fabulous Shannon is, there are all the quirky fun supporting characters. From her grumpy cat to her outspoken mom, her bff and her cheapskate boss. This book is bursting at the seems with all the fun and witty banter!!! I had to pick up the ebook, just so I could make favorite quotes on Goodreads!!I listened to the audiobook narrated by Tanya Eby, who is delightful! She has the perfect tone for the vibe of this book. I love the way she adds energy and sass to the characters. She keeps the story moving right along with her swift pace. The men's voice are just masculine enough, without seeming like a caricature. Definitely a narrator I will be looking for more of in the future! She gives good voice!!!The book leaves off at on okay point, just starting things out and ready to see what comes next. As a general rule, I do not like books that are delivered piece mail. However, this one being all out already helps soften that for me. Pick up this first book free on Amazon and then get the audio on a whispersync deal. You will be just as hooked as I am!Disclosure - I received a copy of this book in exchange for an honest review.

I got through a third of the book and just couldn't do it any longer. The 5 minute audio sample was cute and the book is billed as a \"romantic comedy\" so I was looking forward to it. I had the kindle version (free, thank goodness) and the audio book was only $1.99 (a good deal, I thought). Do not waste your time or your money on this. After the 5 minute sample the book goes downhill quickly. The lead character (Shannon) goes on and on about the body/figure/looks of the main character (Declan) whom she has not yet met and fantasizes about how great it would be to touch him (and do more). And she goes on and on and on, ad nauseum-- multiple times, multiple scenes all within the first third of the book that I made it through. The comedic parts that I got to, I did not find particularly funny, mostly I thought they were dumb. The further I got into the book, the more grating I found Shannon. I just couldn't deal with her, so I gave up. Very disappointing. I had such high hopes for it."}, {"userName": "Siv30", "userReviewDate": "Jan 25, 2017", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/5260037-siv30", "userReview": "\u05d1\u05d4\u05ea\u05d7\u05dc\u05d4 \u05d4\u05e1\u05e4\u05e8 \u05e0\u05e8\u05d0\u05d4 \u05db\u05e2\u05d5\u05d3 \u05d0\u05d7\u05d3 \u05de\u05d4\u05e1\u05e4\u05e8\u05d9\u05dd \u05d1\u05e1\u05d3\u05e8\u05d5\u05ea \u05d4\u05d1\u05dc\u05ea\u05d9 \u05e0\u05d2\u05de\u05e8\u05d5\u05ea \u05e2\u05dc \u05d1\u05d7\u05d5\u05e8\u05d4 \u05e6\u05e2\u05d9\u05e8\u05d4 \u05d5\u05e7\u05e6\u05ea \u05e7\u05dc\u05d5\u05dc\u05e1\u05d9\u05ea \u05e9\u05e0\u05e0\u05d8\u05e9\u05ea \u05e2\"\u05d9 \u05d0\u05e8\u05d5\u05e1\u05d4 \u05e8\u05e7 \u05db\u05d3\u05d9 \u05dc\u05d9\u05e4\u05d5\u05dc \u05db\u05e4\u05e8\u05d9 \u05d1\u05e9\u05dc \u05dc\u05d9\u05d3\u05d9 \u05d4\u05de\u05dc\u05d9\u05d5\u05e0\u05e8 \u05d4\u05d1\u05d0. \u05dc\u05e4\u05e2\u05de\u05d9\u05dd \u05d0\u05d5\u05ea\u05d5 \u05de\u05dc\u05d9\u05d5\u05e0\u05e8 \u05d2\u05dd \u05e0\u05d5\u05e9\u05d0 \u05ea\u05db\u05d5\u05e0\u05d5\u05ea \u05d0\u05d5\u05e4\u05d9 \u05de\u05de\u05e9 \u05de\u05d3\u05db\u05d0\u05d5\u05ea \u05d5\u05e9\u05e8\u05d5\u05d8\u05d5\u05ea \u05e9\u05d4\u05df \u05ea\u05d5\u05e6\u05e8 \u05e9\u05dc \u05d9\u05dc\u05d3\u05d5\u05ea\u05d5 \u05d4\u05e2\u05e9\u05d5\u05e7\u05d4 \u05d5\u05d7\u05e1\u05e8\u05ea \u05d0\u05d4\u05d1\u05ea \u05d0\u05dd.\u05d0\u05d1\u05dc \u05d6\u05d4 \u05dc\u05d0 \u05d4\u05de\u05e7\u05e8\u05d4 \u05e2\u05dd \u05e9\u05d0\u05e0\u05d5\u05df \u05d5\u05d3\u05d0\u05e7\u05dc\u05df. \u05e9\u05d0\u05e0\u05d5\u05df \u05d8\u05d9\u05e4\u05d5\u05e1 \u05e2\u05dd \u05d0\u05d9\u05e0\u05d8\u05e8\u05d5\u05e1\u05e4\u05e7\u05d8\u05d9\u05d1\u05d4 \u05de\u05e1\u05e4\u05d9\u05e7 \u05db\u05e0\u05d4 \u05db\u05d3\u05d9 \u05dc\u05e8\u05d0\u05d5\u05ea \u05d0\u05ea \u05e2\u05e6\u05de\u05d4 \u05d5\u05d0\u05ea \u05de\u05e9\u05e4\u05d7\u05ea\u05d4 \u05d4\u05d4\u05d6\u05d5\u05d9\u05d4 \u05d1\u05d0\u05d5\u05e8 \u05d1\u05d4\u05d9\u05e8. \u05d4\u05e1\u05e6\u05e0\u05d4 \u05e9\u05dc \u05d4\u05d3\u05d9\u05d9\u05d8 \u05d4\u05e8\u05d0\u05e9\u05d5\u05df \u05e4\u05e9\u05d5\u05d8 \u05de\u05e6\u05d7\u05d9\u05e7\u05d4 \u05d1\u05de\u05d9\u05d5\u05d7\u05d3 \u05d4\u05e7\u05d8\u05e2 \u05d0\u05dd \u05d0\u05de\u05d0 \u05e9\u05dc\u05d4 \u05e9\u05de\u05dc\u05d5\u05d5\u05d4 \u05d0\u05d5\u05ea\u05d4 \u05dc\u05d3\u05d9\u05d9\u05d8 \u05d4\u05e2\u05d9\u05e1\u05e7\u05d9 \u05d5\u05de\u05ea\u05e0\u05d4\u05d2\u05ea \u05db\u05d0\u05d9\u05dc\u05d5 \u05d4\u05dd \u05d7\u05ea\u05df \u05d5\u05db\u05dc\u05d4.\u05d2\u05dd \u05d3\u05e7\u05d0\u05dc\u05df \u05dc\u05d0 \u05e1\u05d5\u05d1\u05dc \u05de\u05e9\u05e8\u05d9\u05d8\u05d5\u05ea \u05e2\u05de\u05d5\u05e7\u05d5\u05ea \u05de\u05d9\u05d3\u05d9 \u05d5\u05d4\u05de\u05e4\u05d2\u05e9\u05d9\u05dd \u05e9\u05dc\u05d5 \u05e2\u05dd \u05e9\u05d0\u05e0\u05d5\u05df \u05de\u05e9\u05e2\u05e9\u05e2\u05d9\u05dd \u05d5\u05d4\u05d6\u05d5\u05d9\u05d9\u05dd. \u05d7\u05de\u05d5\u05d3 \u05d1\u05d9\u05d5\u05ea\u05e8 \u05db\u05d4\u05ea\u05d7\u05dc\u05d4 \u05dc 10 \u05e1\u05e4\u05e8\u05d9\u05dd.\u05d4\u05d8\u05d9\u05e4\u05d5\u05e1\u05d9\u05dd \u05de\u05e1\u05e4\u05d9\u05e7 \u05d0\u05e7\u05e1\u05e6\u05e0\u05d8\u05e8\u05d9\u05dd \u05d1\u05db\u05d3\u05d9 \u05e9\u05d4\u05d9\u05d0 \u05dc\u05d0 \u05ea\u05d3\u05e8\u05e9 \u05dc\u05e1\u05e7\u05e1 \u05db\u05d1\u05e8 \u05d1\u05e1\u05e4\u05e8\u05d5\u05df \u05d4\u05e8\u05d0\u05e9\u05d5\u05df, \u05d5\u05de\u05d0\u05d9\u05d3\u05da \u05d4\u05de\u05ea\u05d7 \u05d4\u05de\u05d9\u05e0\u05d9 \u05e7\u05d9\u05d9\u05dd. \u05db\u05da \u05e9\u05d6\u05d5 \u05d4\u05ea\u05d7\u05dc\u05d4 \u05d8\u05d5\u05d1\u05d4 (\u05d0\u05dd \u05db\u05d9 \u05e7\u05e6\u05e8\u05d4 \u05de\u05d9\u05d3\u05d9 )"}, {"userName": "Chanpreet", "userReviewDate": "Apr 08, 2016", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/5334800-chanpreet", "userReview": "This is hilarious and so hot!
