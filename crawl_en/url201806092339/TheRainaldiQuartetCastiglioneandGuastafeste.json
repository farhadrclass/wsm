Yet Guastafeste and Gianni find their friend Rainaldi murdered in this studio. His widow tells them he was searching for The Messiah's Sister, the twin to a perfect, unplayed, priceless violin made by Stradivari. Their hunt takes them from the sleepy town of Cremona, to Venice, Milan and England, resulting in another murder, searching for another priceless violin and, possibly, widower Gianni finding a new love.Paul Adam has such a wonderful voice. It is so comfortable that, from the very beginning with a gathering of friends, you feel as though you are one of them. This makes the events which follow all the more impactful. Yet, his is a wonderfully wry, pragmatic voice. Although the story is set in some glorious cities, he conveys the feeling of a native by not romanticizing them\u2026\u201dSt. Mark\u2019s [in Venice] is an architectural wonder, but with all those Byzantine domes and pinnacles, it looks gaudy and vulgar, like a Mafia capo\u2019s wedding cake.\u201dThe characters are fully developed; you know their histories and their relationships to one another. But it\u2019s more than a surface acquaintance. Particularly with Gianni, you know the pain of his past and understand his acceptance of the present and future. A possible change to that is, then, all the more enticing. You sense his morality and deep friendship with Guastafeste which makes Gianni\u2019s struggle with an action from the past and his friend\u2019s learning of it all the more poignant. Even the secondary characters are vivid and brought to life. Each character is memorable on their own and none more so than Mrs. Colquhoen with her myriad of cats all named \u201cTimmy\u201d. The theme of the book is music and, in particular, violins; the artistry involved in the making of them, their history, the obsession one can have for collecting them, and the greed for selling them. All of this is integrated into the story in a way that is fascinating, rather than boring. \u201cThe Rainaldi Quartet\u201d is a combination history and music lesson, but it is also a jigsaw puzzle and treasure hunt with an excellent resolution. Most of all, it is one great read!\tTHE RAINALDI QUARTET (AKA SLEEPER) (Mys- Castiglione/ Guastafeste-Italy-Contemp) \u2013 VG+Adam, Paul \u2013 1st in seriesTime Warner Books, 2004Original Review:Adam, Paul \u2013 5th bookTime Warner, 2005 \u2013 PaperbackGiovanni \"Gianni\" Castiglioni is a luthier--a violin maker--at whose home his friends--a policeman, Guastafeste, a priest, Father Arrigh, and a fellow luthier, Rainaldi--gather each month as an informal string quartet.

Gianni is asked by Guastafeste to help in the investigation.***This book is being released in hardcover by St. Martin's as \"The Rainaldi Quartet\" in February 2006. No matter the title, I thoroughly enjoyed this book. The character of Gianni, the supporting characters and the settings in Italy were well done. The killer, and the motive, weren't ones I anticipated. But it was the history of violins and violin making I found fascinating. The information enhanced, rather than detracted, from the story. If this is an example of Mr. Adam's writing, I should definitely read another book by him."}, {"userName": "Colin Birge", "userReviewDate": "Apr 27, 2010", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/3426021-colin-birge", "userReview": "For me, this is one of the rare instances where the sequel was better than the original. The Rainaldi Quartet is the first book in a mystery series by Paul Adam, designed around the world of classical music and historic violins. Yes, obligatory murders happen, but the real interest of the book is the search for a historically important, perfectly made violin from the late 1700s.I'd already read the book's sequel, Paganini's Ghost, and I find I prefer the sequel to the original. The Rainaldi Quartet feels looser, more exploratory, as if the author didn't really know the characters yet. Paganini's Ghost is more taut and interesting.Both books are very fast reads, entertaining, fun, and light."}, {"userName": "Michelle", "userReviewDate": "Jul 23, 2011", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/5861493-michelle", "userReview": "The story begins as four men in Italy meet as they have many times before to play music as a string quartet. One is a priest, 2 make violins and one is a detective. When one of the violin makers is murdered in his shop, the detective (Antonio) seeks the aid of the other violin maker (Gianni) to help determine if anything has been stolen from his shop. They discover that the murdered man had been in search of an undiscovered Stradavarius called the \"Messiah's Sister\". We follow along as they investigate both the murder and the search for the violin. The author does a magnificient job of interweaving the history and mystique of these violins, as well as the subculture surrounding them and determining their historical provenence. The author also goies into a detailed discussion about fakes and how they are made. The two travel to Venice and England in order to discover the truth. I enjoyed both the mystery and the musical subculture explored by the book."}, {"userName": "Joyce", "userReviewDate": "Mar 27, 2009", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/1438068-joyce", "userReview": "This is a nice book. But not a good one.I think what irritated me is that the Italian characters didn't ring true. They didn't act Italian if that makes sense. My husband is Italian and I lived in Northern Italy for several years and the dialogue and character attitudes did not ring true. Also, the way the story ended, all neat and pat was a. not something you'd find in an Italian mystery and again, too neat and pat for my taste.The ending was too quick and too expected. If you like really sweet things, then you'll like this novel. On the back the publishers say it is will appeal to fans of Donna Leon. But it actually won't. Donna Leon understands Italy and the Italian personality/character. So fans of her novels will be most likely be irritated by this.Fans of cute cozies on the other hand will probably like this."}, {"userName": "Bethany", "userReviewDate": "Jan 10, 2008", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/767062-bethany", "userReview": "The Rainaldi Quartet begins with the murder of an elderly violin-maker and progresses throughout Europe as the violin-maker\u2019s friends attempt to discover who did the deed and why.

The quartet of the title includes Gianni, Antonio, Tomaso Rainaldi and Father Arrighi who gather periodically to play for their own enjoyment. Tomaso, also a luthier, is found dead in his workshop after such a musical gathering. Gianni and Antonio soon join forces to solve the murder of their friend. But their friend Tomaso has been keeping a secret from them involving a priceless violin. The more they investigate, the more complex their task becomes as myth and history merge. Does the violin even exist and how is it connected to Tomaso's murder? Gianni and Antonio travel to Milan, Venice and various small Italian towns, to England and finally back to Italy in pursuit of answers. Paul Adam provides a tour of musical history, violin making and related myths, the world of collecting such instruments along with the detecting.

Set in quiet Cremona, Italy, the story centers around the murder of an aging luthier, Tomaso Rainaldi, and a mysterious violin known as the \"Messiah's Sister\" rumored to have been missing for centuries, if it even existed in the first place. Two members of Rainaldi's quartet -- a fellow aging luthier named Gianni Castiglione and a police officer name Antonio Guastafeste -- set out to determine who murdered their friend (and why) and end up on a quest for the \"Messiah's Sister\" with travel to England and other parts of Italy. The author weaves the art of violinmaking and music into the mystery, and also reveals the darker side of music appreciation.

I was pleased because it sounded unusual. The central character who investigates the case is luthier Gianni Castiligione. Luthiers make stringed instruments. Although the mystery aspect is about the case of the murdered luthier, Tomasso Rinaldi, it also deals with a quest for a legendary violin. I really liked the perspective. We get to see into Gianni Castilliogne's mind. We get insight into how he experiences music and his love for violins. I was impressed by what he had to say to Rinaldi's granddaughter, a budding violinist.Other good points of The Rainaldi Quartet were the plotting, the background about luthiers, violin dealers and the history of violins.For my blog version of this review see my July 2013 post \"The Rainaldi Quartet: A Legendary Violin Brings Murder to Cremona Italy\" at http://www.maskedpersona.blogspot.com"}, {"userName": "Jean Hontz", "userReviewDate": "May 22, 2016", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/1356580-jean-hontz", "userReview": "Admittedly, I have a thing about the forging, stealing, creating, or collecting of works of art.

For his friend and fellow violin-maker Gianni Castiglione, the murder is as mysterious as it is shocking. Rainaldi had few possessions, no enemies and little money. No one - least of all the police - can fathom a motive for murdering him. All he really had was an obsessive love of violins and an encyclopedic knowledge of them. But what if he knew more than anyone else - not just about famous violins, but about missing violins? Ones of the caliber of the fabled Messiah, Stradivari's most sublime creation, the Mona Lisa of the music world. A violin now in the Ashmolean Museum in Oxford - and worth millions\u2026Aided by his friend, policeman Antonio Guastafeste, Gianni starts to investigate the dead man's affairs.
