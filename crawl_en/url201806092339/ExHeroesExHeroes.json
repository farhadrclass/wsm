Clines has a bit of fun with gender (see below), which i appreciate; he also has a couple situations that had me feeling a wee bit tense. check and check. unfortunately the debits outweigh the credits in Ex-Heroes. sub-par \"cheeky\" dialogue is one problem. another is the delusion that celebrities in Los Angeles are so plentiful that various characters can joke about taking out a dozen or so of the subspecies. not only did this running joke become annoying, it is entirely unrealistic. okay, i understand that saying something is \"unrealistic\" within a novel about superheroes protecting normals from zombie hordes in after-the-fall america is a bit laughable. but come on already, author-from-Maine. i've lived in So-Cal for a good number of years... celebrities can be relatively commonplace. relatively. but not so commonplace that random characters will be able to take down dozens of them. at times i felt like i was back traveling in Turkey and being asked yet again if i actually knew or had at least seen this or that celebrity... because L.A. must be such a small town, right? just too naively goofy a supposition.but the problem that actually offended me is that the \"good\" L.A. of this novel is overwhelmingly, ridiculously WHITE AND NORMAL. perhaps it is actually based on Maine. all the normals are white, except for one repulsively characterized asian bitch. all of the superheroes are white, except for one dead asian superhero (a Korean who takes on a Japanese moniker for chrissakes) and another superhero who is black. and everyone is straight-ahead normal normal normal. on the other hand, the villains are characterized by their crazy hair, tattoos, oh and they are all LATINO gangbangers. the dearth of imagination when it came to race really aggravated me. hey Clines, having crazy hair and being inked AND BEING LATINO doesn't mean you're a bad person who wants to cause trouble. has the author actually ever been to L.A.? for all of its flaws, it is a racially diverse city full of people who pride themselves on looking different. as a once non-normal looking person and as an asian who is often confused with being latino, i was triply taken aback on behalf of all three demographics. boo! offensive lack of imagination!the \"Superhero Novel\" is a gutter subgenre only slightly enlivened by the likes of Chabon and Soon I Will Be Invincible. this novel is not helping matters.____________________\nSuper Template Action!\n* Superman: St. George (formerly known as \"The Mighty Dragon\". not as clever an idea as it thinks it is)* Batman: Stealth (a chick! i like)* Iron Man: Cerberus (another chick! i doubly like)* Captain Atom or perhaps Firestorm: Zzzap* The Demon: Cairosand a few who seem like original creations, which was nice. Gorgon, Regenerator (healing powers that are at the root of a surprisingly effective plot reveal), and Midknight (he has an EMP field! interesting)."}, {"userName": "Carol.

I understand that this is a book about superheroes, which lend themselves to stereotypes. Except in a genre full of them, Cline seems determined to use them all. There is the 'Boy Scout,' who is working for the greater good; the 'Anti-hero,' who is the bad boy that flaunts authority; the 'Radioactive,' who developed powers after being exposed to radiation (actually, Cline explains a couple superheroes this way); the 'Gifted Female,' whose sexuality is her dominant image; the 'Demon,' who has bonded with evil; the 'Teenager,' the normal kid who develops superpowers; the 'Bestial,' who has part animal in his nature. In a nod to Ironman, there is a female engineer in an iron suit. Whoops--I almost forgot the 'Woman in Refrigerator' character--the dead woman that moves the superhero's plot forward through grief/guilt/etc.(1) Oh, and for those who are aggravated by such things, at least two Supers are Mary Sues.Extra negative points for stereotypes--first, the bitchy Asian council-woman; second, transforming a Korean girl into a Japanese hero; and third, making a Latino gang into the antagonists. What, you couldn't find any Nazis or Russians from 1960? Oh wait--the nickname of the Latino gang was abbreviated 'S.S.,' which almost counts. (For mark's insightful commentary, see (2))Faint attempt to give cookie-cutter superheroes depth by giving introducing a 'past' and a 'present' narrative were insufficient. 'Nuff said.**************************************The zombie apocalypse is about a loss of organized society as the individual struggles against the horrific; they become about survival, transformation and the meaning of humanity. The best apocalypse stories focus on rebuilding order out of chaos while struggling to survive. Ex-Heroes is pretty much the exact opposite. After retreating to a movie studio, the supers essentially form their own oligarchy, or perhaps dictatorship, since Stealth makes all the decisions. The supers don't call it that, of course. But they are the ones strategizing, setting goals, deciding, protecting, and leading. Sure, normal humans help in some of these roles. But you don't hear humans participating in the process, except to fulfill the stereotypical role of antagonistic-suspicion-of-well-intentioned-superhero. The humans are the mirrors for the heroes, the pets, the sheep to lead and direct; the only agency they have is that of poor decision-making. Ultimately, while that may be a prevalent theme in superhero mediums, it is the antithesis of zombie apocalypse fiction.**************************************What did I like? It was quick and readable. While the language was not ornate, it was coherent and focused. The \"Then\" narratives that gave background on the heroes were interesting and told well, even if they weren't particularly unique stories (ah, to be a beautiful genius--the troubles I would have!). The section I enjoyed the most is the one few zombie books concentrate on--recognizing the outbreak and attempting to curtail the viral invasion. Cline's analysis was likely spot on in the official reaction, and was creative when Stealth was sending Zzzap out on a mission to locate the living dead. Although some of the explanation of the virus was eye-rolling pseudo-science, but at the end it was combined with an impressive twist that made it worth the effort.On the borderlands of my normal reading material, I appreciated the challenge. In regards to rating, it hits squarely in my 2.5 zone, but I imagine it is decently done for its genre.

I don\u2019t care what you believe in. The Loch Ness monster, Bigfoot, faked moon landings, the 2000 election results\u2014you can believe in whatever fairy tale you want.\n\nBefore you read this book you have to ask yourself:1.\tDo I like Books that read like summer blockbuster movies?2.\tDo I like Flawed Superheroes that aren\u2019t completely altruistic?3.\tDo I like Zombie Books?4.\tDo I like dark humor that also includes pop culture references?5.\tIf Joss Whedon and J.J. Abrams had a son that only wrote books would he be Peter Clines?If you said yes three or more of the above questions then Ex-Heroes is probably right up your alley.I really enjoyed how this book took two genres and really combined them together seamlessly. It could have become extra cheesy with Superheroes and Zombies but I really enjoyed the moments that were serious and the others that made fun of the zombie apocalypse itself. I alternated between the Audio (which is fantastic and I totally recommend if you listen to Audiobooks at all) and the ebook.The story is set around a group of Superheroes who have come together Avenger style to protect a group of people inside a former movie studio. The story is revealed in a past/present multiple POV telling much in the style of LOST. From the POV of the Superheroes there are a few chapters in the present and then a chapter from the past and the beginning of the zombie apocalypse. In the collapse of society it isn\u2019t just the Zombies that our Heroes have to face. They are also in a turf war with a gang from LA who wants the guns and ammunition the Heroes have stockpiled.\n\nPeople could say a lot of negative things about the apocalypse, but there was no arguing the air quality in Los Angeles had really improved.\n\nWith the way the story is told the reader gets a sense of the decay of society and how it all went downhill so fast. Plus Peter Clines did something that no other Zombie book I\u2019ve read to date has done. He actually showed us how the Zombie virus got start and who was Patient Zero. It was done in such a great way that I thought it blended in with the story perfectly, so bravo on that.There are plenty of times to be serious throughout the book and well not everyone makes it out alive (it\u2019s a zombie book I don\u2019t think anyone should be surprised by that) there is enough dark humor to keep me engaged in the story. Clines even included a game of your top 5 celebrity kills to kind of show how in the aftermath people are trying to keep spirits up. What an interesting take on the fall of society and there is even the new additional problems of former superheroes as Zombies.Peter Clines gave every POV a very distinctive feel and even changed the way the story was told in a few chapters to really change the voice of each. The way the chapter on Cairax was written in particular was my favorite. There were only a few things I struggled with. There are a lot of characters and all the Superheroes have their secret identity name and then their Superhero name. I got a little confused keeping them all straight for a little while sorta like a George RR Martin Book I needed a character tree. But by the end I totally had the hang of it I hope. Because there are so many characters it was hard to get a really in-depth look at any. But since this is a series I\u2019m sure that will be ultimately remedied.The only other issue I had was with the action sequences getting a little bit repetitive that I lost focus. But I\u2019m totally a girl and that would happen for me in a blockbuster movie as well. There are great moments in the action sequences too, like using one zombie to knock around others and such but I only have a limited attention span for fight scenes.All and all this was a lot of fun and as I didn\u2019t know anything about this book other than I liked a different Peter Clines book called 14 I wasn\u2019t sure what to expect. I will just say that I\u2019m pleasantly surprised and can\u2019t wait to see what the next installment brings."}, {"userName": "Eric", "userReviewDate": "Aug 08, 2011", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/2786617-eric", "userReview": "How kickass is this book? I am currently sitting on toilet but not going to the bathroom at work just to try and get my thoughts out. I figure that if anyone does read this, enjoys the hell out of this book, and comes to thank me because of my review - they won't mind. Deal with it :pSeriously I love the imagery of the entire thing. You would think that it's all just blood, guts, and load of undead and in one way it totally is but there is so much more. Epic. This book is totally epic. The way Clines tells the story with his then and nows is very well developed. It's like he's a master juggler putting on his best act just asking you to keep on watching. He's good. So good I'm starting the next part as soon as I'm done here. And after that I'm pretty sure I'm a fan and will read his other works ASAP. Update: I am a HUGE fan. No hesitation to speak of. Clines is a genius. Seriously though in an uncoordinated hand this story would be all over the place. He takes you wherever you think you want to go, keeps the story moving along in real time, knowing where it's going shows you just a sliver to make sure you're paying attention all while the juggling act keeps going you didn't even see he's go the grand finale unloading on another part of the stage. You just can't believe there's fire, and more gasoline and a tiger and the Titanic (how did he get the Titanic on stage you may ask, YOU DON'T CARE AND YOU'RE GOING TO BE OK WITH IT!) all seemly like it's not big deal the fireworks are not going off indoors to blow the roof off over your head. One moment you're hearing exposition and you think to yourself ok I have a grasp of what's going on and then he shows you a new trick, taking you to a different time or place like it's meant to happen that way and you're left there just staring. Not trying to make sense of it but to wonder how did you get sucked in so deep, so quickly. Love it. Yes I know the act may seem like a bit much at times but when you get home later and your house has pimped out by Clines cause he got bored with his magic act you thank him. That's what I'm trying to tell you right now. I thank you Mr. Clines. I thank you for sharing your awesome with us.Also I've had a couple of delusions of grandeur while reading this. One, making it into a blockbuster movie is inevitable and two, while I really liked the heroes portrayed I actually had a few favorites not just one and a bunch of sidekicks. I want them to all have their own films. I'm a fan. Just saying. Its actually taking me a bit longer than I thought to get all this down on my phone and so without rising any suspicion in here I'm going to pause it.Seriously though, have I mentioned how sweet this book is? It honestly felt like someone pumped some adrenaline into my veins. Work has moved quick with some books lately (don't get me wrong) but this one... hot damn the night was over almost as soon as it started AND we're in mandatory overtime. Yeah yeah I'm clearly out of the bathroom now ;-)I'm recommending this to anyone who's a fan of the genre, anyone curious, anyone with a pulse really. I mean it's a totally different feel than Hold Me Closer, Necromancer (was that really last week already?) but it's just as worth it.

HOWEVER, PLEASE NOTE THAT THIS AUTHOR IS CLEARLY STILL A PREPUBESCENT BOY. Every woman in this book is either a hypersexualized wet fantasy or is characterized as a \"bitch.\" Even the zombies are constantly hypersexualized -- there are plenty of descriptions of emaciated zombie women in skimpy or torn clothes, at one point the author even goes on to describe the way blood ran between a zombies breasts. It probably won't surprise anyone to find out that the author mentions not one but TWO instances of non-graphic necrophilia.Stealth, in particular, is the author's wet dream fantasy put to paper. She wears a skintight uniform, but keeps her face hidden because she is apparently SO beautiful that men tend to think she's incapable of being more than a model. That the author admits to having created all of these characters in grade school just makes me uncomfortable that he never grew out of this blatant misogyny. There's also the issue of race. NONE of the heroes are people of color, besides the already deceased Banzai, who is pretty stereotyped in the few pages she was given. In fact the only character on the \"good side\" described as Asian is one of the anti-super hero citizens of the Mount. I can't recall any of the SS gang members being white.The author does mention a little bit of queerness. I read Stealth as asexual, but having experimented with men and women in college. And a few times women would ogle women. However, this seems to coincide with the author's sexist fantasies rather than being completely inclusive.Actually, I feel bad for rating this so high, but everything else was just excellent. It's really unfortunate that talented writers have to be such assholes. I will tell you this: I won't be reading Ex-Patriot. Other reviews have mentioned an increase in racism and sexism, which I don't think I'd be able to ignore.EDITED to change my rating to a 3. The more I think about it, the less I want to reward the author for the misogyny and racism in this book."}, {"userName": "Lindsey Rey", "userReviewDate": "May 27, 2014", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/5436213-lindsey-rey", "userReview": "The concept for this is really cool.

Yeah...I was wary.I have to admit that I was surprised at how much I ended up enjoying this book. There were several superheroes, all original creations. At least I think they were because I have never heard of them. As the story progressed, there where chapters labeled 'Now' and 'Then'. Each 'Then' segment spent a bit of time with a superhero and filled in the gaps about them-as far as how they were created and how they came to be in LA fighting zombies.Yes, superheroes fighting zombies...I know it sounds silly (and it was a little bit silly), but it was also well written, gory, bloody and just good fun.

AND when he comes across zombie/X-superheroes he takes them and drops them off somewhere...leaving them to continue killing and infecting others. Not a really \"Good-Guy (Lawful Good) thing to do. I mean he can't bring himself to \"putdown\" the undead versions of super-people he used to know. The zombies are dead (whether you knew them before or not).

Narration is in the first-person for all \u201cThen\u201d chapters and in third person for all the \u201cNow\u201d sections. The POV's both first person and third person are via Stealth, Gorgon, Cairax, Regenerator, Cerberus, Zzzap, The Mighty Dragon, Lady Bee, Banzai, St. George and a few minor characters. Ex-Heroes is self-contained and is the first book in the Ex Trilogy.February 25, 2010 marked the paperback and e-book publication of Ex-Heroes via Permuted press. Cover art is provided by Garret DeChellis. CLASSIFICATION: Mixing zombies with superheroes in a desolate Los Angeles. Peter Clines\u2019s world of Ex-Heroes is George Romero\u2019s Dawn of the Dead meets David Gemmell\u2019s Legend meets The X-Men. ANALYSIS: I had been noticing Ex-Heroes since last year however it kind of got lost in my \u201cBooks-to-be-checked\u201d list. However Amazon\u2019s recommendations made sure that it was never really out of my mind, as it always used to pop up every now and then. After the release of Ex-Patriots the sequel to this book, I contacted the publisher for review copies and they graciously sent both the books over promptly. I was hugely excited to see that it was focusing on superheroes coupled with zombies and I was hoping that it would not disappoint.The author has quite cleverly divided the book into the past \u201cthen\u201d and present \u201cnow\u201d sections and thereby maintaining the tension in the story while going forward as well giving us the crucial back story. The \u201cnow\u201d begins in the current where a sizeable portion of humanity is holed up in Paramount Studios which has now been renamed \u201cThe Mount\u201d. The humans within are surviving from the horror outside wherein zombies freely roam and look for fresh human meat, the zombies in this world are called \u201cExes\u201d as in Ex-humans. The human population though has an upper hand with the super heroes who are protecting them.Stealth, Gorgon, Regenerator, Cerberus, Zzzap, Lady Bee, St. George and a few others have shepherded humanity and are doing their best defeat the zombies while also searching for a cure. The \u201cthen\u201d sections focus on each superhero separately and we are given a clear look into their beginnings, this leads to a very precise picture about each of them while differentiating their personas in the reader\u2019s minds. The story then begins as the heroes forage on almost a daily basis and try to retrieve as many tangible goods as they can with a few normal volunteers however they have been noticing that some one is competing with them and also leaving booby traps which creates further problems. The story then escalates as the people of the Mount find out who it is that has been hindering their survival and what do they want which leads to the question \u201cwhat will they do to survive?\u201dI completely loved this book and while it was a debut book, it didn\u2019t feel so at all. With a very clever but not wholly original premise, the author unleashes a very exciting story which grabs the reader\u2019s attention and then proceeds to charm the reader in a variety of ways. Firstly the plot is a great one as the story begins with a scenario which should appeal to most zombie/apocalypse enthusiasts. From then on the author keeps the story moving forward with some great twists as well as the past recollections of each superhero. This tactic keeps the twin story strands; the past and the present constantly entwined while delivering the clues about the enemy and also illuminating the mistakes of the past. I was thrilled with the way the story was presented and how in the end the author managed to pull it off by coalescing all the threads and resolving all the questions arising in the readers minds.The author has also aced the characterization department as we are given access to many characters and all of them have vastly different personalities and agendas. This was what differentiated the characters from being comic book clones. And even though most of heroes have their own issues a la the X-men, the author has conveniently provided the back stories which clue the reader in to these issues. Another tremendously exciting point was the humor which is present in all forms through out the story, from the black humor laced conversations to the celebrity zombie hunts; the author manages to make the darkness of the situation a little lighter. There also tons of references to various comic book characters, movies, SFF shows, books etc. making it an interesting read in addition to all the previous plus points.Lastly this book\u2019s climax draws parallels with David Gemmell\u2019s classic debut Legend, in the sense, the reader gets a sense of claustrophobia as the holed up survivors try to defeat an enemy who has massive strength in numbers while also facing problems from within. Granted that David Gemmell\u2019s book was built on that single premise whereas over here the book\u2019s climax is a one long drawn out fight which will have the readers flipping pages to see who survives & who doesn\u2019t and what is the final outcome. For me I got that overall Legend-like vibe and kudos to the author for making the climax that much exciting.I really loved this book for all of its good points which made it such a fun read, however the parts combined together make it an excellent book all together. I would have point that I really couldn\u2019t find any deficiencies or things to nitpick. One can point out that the author utilizes various tropes among the superheroes like the all invincible hero with the heart of gold, the secretive hero who stays alone even among the hero ken, etc. But with all the tropes being utilized Peter has still managed to put his own spin to these characters and the story thereby making it his own and one which can stand all amongst other wonderful debuts. After all almost all SFF novels utilize tropes in one form or the other and it is up to the writer to make them seem seamless within the confines of the plot. To his credit Peter Clines passes with flying colors in his debut by giving the readers a tale which they can cherish for a long time to come. CONCLUSION: An excellent debut which spans many sub-genres and has a little bit of everything to satisfy most of its readers. Ex-Heroes is a standout debut in the superhero and zombie genre. Simply put I was completely floored by this book\u2019s ingenuity and charm; I definitely hope that Hollywood never ruins this one by making it into a movie. Heartily recommended for all fantasy, thriller, horror fans who would want to read a book which best exemplifies the real meaning of a page-turner. Peter Clines\u2019s debut easily makes him the most under-appreciated author of 2010 and now I can\u2019t wait to read what he has done next in Ex-Patriots."}, {"userName": "Roy", "userReviewDate": "Apr 14, 2018", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/38117634-roy", "userReview": "Very easy book to read.

You don't have to love stories about zombies in order to enjoy this book, but you have to be tolerant towards them. The sole reason I lost interest in EX-heroes was the annoying sense of deja-vu that I some times get when I watch a movie, a tv show or play a video game featuring a virus turning everyone into brainless man-eating monsters. And yes, I know it's a genre on its own, so I don't really have the right to complain about the similarities.Ex-heroes goes one step further by adding people with super powers who are trying to protect whatever's left of humanity. Surviving an apocalyptic future might sound easier if you have heroes on your side, right? Don't get your hopes high, they are more powerful than any human, but not powerful enough to save everybody and that is exactly what makes this book unique and worth checking out- how do you deal with the sense of responsibility, the struggles knowing that all this power you posses is not making as much of a difference as you wished. Loved the angst, loved the heroes' POVs.Unfortunately for me, I think I am getting tired of the zombie-survival genre. Even if it features super-heroes.Has anyone noticed how big zombies have become for the past 5-10 years?

So I got more into Stephen King and zombie stuff, then \u201cThe Watchmen\u201d came out. I liked Watchmen because the heroes had a dark side to them. They were not all good, they were flawed, I liked that.So when I met Peter at a con and got his book I was curious to read it. Super Heroes AAAAND Zombies! Sign me up!My favorite parts were the origin stories, the heroes and zombies are both relatively new to this world.To keep this brief I\u2019m just going to talk about one.***SPOILER ALERT***Maxwell Hale is a magician. Not like that D-Bag Chris Angle, but like a sorcerer. He had a theory, if demons can possess people\u2026 Well that\u2019s a two way door right. So he experimented with some spells, gathered some artifacts, waited until the stars lined up just right, and hijacked a demons body from another dimension. The only problem is, when he steals the demons body, he THINKS like a demon. He\u2019s still himself, but his thoughts are \u2018filtered\u2019 so to say.So, after the outbreak happens and Cairax (Maxwell\u2019s demon skin) is out saving humanity, it doesn\u2019t seem weird to \u2018have relations\u2019 with Jessica Alba\u2019s zombified corpse. To Cairax it\u2019s more like jerking off than anything else. And besides, so far he\u2019s proven immune to the virus.WRONG! Should have worn a condom you dumbass demon.

It hit all the right notes for reading pleasure. Ex-Heroes had a fun premise- people with super powers that are turned into zombies still retain their powers as they now hunt for human flesh. Sounds interesting right? The execution of weaving multiple stories was good, showing each currently serving hero before and after the zombie apocalypse, and how the world came to be the way it is. So what went wrong? For me it was definitely the characters. Cline wanted to hit all the hero tropes- the sexualized heroine, the gunslinger who\u2019s ends justified the means, the boy scout\u2026. You get the picture. The problem was that they never progressed beyond being just tropes. They were flat, and to me, unrelatable. I listened to the whole story because it was fine, and it passed the time as I weeded my garden, but at no point was I desperately waiting to hear what happened next, or trying to \u201csolve\u201d the puzzle along with the heroes. I wasn\u2019t bored, but I wasn\u2019t engaged either. I lacked the energy I had had when reading 14. Stealth, the hyper-sexualized female dictator of the superheroes, was to me the most boring, ah woe to me, genius of the beautiful face and bounteous bosoms, but even St. George, arguably the *most* main character, had all of Captain America\u2019s goody-two-shoes attitude but not of the struggle, fervor, or heart to make the character work for me. Ultimately a 2-star read, which is just okay. Night of the Living Trekkies was more fun and The Girl With All the Gifts is a legitimately great book.Also- when I think superheroes and zombies I automatically think scifi. Why is that? I mean, it depends on the mechanism by which the superheroes and zombies get their powers, right? There is a fine line between superhero and wizard, and zombies are fantastical creatures more than scifi creatures if the mechanism is a curse, or the dead just rise. Now I want to read a book about necromantic science. Really blur those scifi and fantasy lines.

It took my two favorite genres horror & super-heroes and smooshed (or is it smushed? Or should I say smashed?) them together to make this novel that reads like a blockbuster movie coming out. Peter Cline does a great job on fleshing out the characters with flashbacks ala Lost with then & now segments of the book.

Ex-Heroes is the ultimate superheroes+zombies mashup, with the Earth's surviving superheroes (okay, Los Angeles's surviving superheroes) protecting what remains of the living human population from the undead hordes after the zombie apocalypse.This very \"high concept\" premise makes for a fun story that would make a pretty entertaining comic series, and Clines delivers plenty of gonzo superheroic action combined with gonzo zombie gore. You can really see he is trying to describe multi-panel superhero slugfests and gut-ripping zombie action in full four-color spectacle just as it would appear on the pages of a comic book, which is why the fight scenes are prolonged and detailed and full of roars and screams and sound effects and people getting knocked through walls and blasted about, interspersed with hero/villain banter and the occasional monologue. So Clines has the feel of the genre for sure.But that's all this book is: a novelized comic book. The characters are interesting insofar as we get flashbacks to their origins, a description of their powers and major personality quirks, and then their current doings in post-zombie-apocalypse LA, but no one really comes alive as more than a comic book illustration accompanied by a list of vitals. Cerberus is the chick in the mecha suit, Stealth is the emotionally detached mastermind who dresses in leather lingerie, Gorgon is the guy whose underage girlfriend got zombified and now he is muchly angsted, the Mighty Dragon is Superman with fire-breath, etc. The Big Bad, when he finally appears, is only mildly threatening since we're pretty much told he's an idiot, which means he'll rack up a few casualties and then be defeated.Clines delivers servicable action, but his writing is not great and his characterization is about par for a comic book. This is a fun but eminently forgettable romp, though I might listen to book two the next time I need some entertainment only slightly less mindless than a zombie movie."}, {"userName": "Neil", "userReviewDate": "Jul 19, 2013", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/10449113-neil", "userReview": "You don't have to like zombies or superheroes to like this book its just a very good read with a lot of interesting characters."}, {"userName": "Badseedgirl", "userReviewDate": "Aug 09, 2017", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/20662786-badseedgirl", "userReview": "I have had a 30 plus year love affair with zombies.

I mean, they were old in 1999 as a metaphor. Romero is the original and no one since has really done anything too new with it. I'll admit, I liked the Walking Dead comics...to a point. The torture issue finished it for me, and I never went back. But I did appreciate the theme running through WD that no matter how brutal the zombies were, it was the cruelty of the living humans that was always the greatest. But zombies were old in 1999 when I mocked the gimmick in my first novel, Death by Zamboni, by having the main character riff on how fun it was to beat up zombies. You can tear 'em apart...or whatever...just for fun. See, no one cares if you kill zombies. It's the perfect excuse for violence. We can glorify the violence and excuse the heroes brutality...because they are dead things, after all. Just viruses controlling bodies for inscrutable reasons.And that brings us to Ex Heroes, a mash-up of superheroes and zombies, which allows for R-rated superhero violence in that exact manner. No one can think badly of them for tearing apart a zombie, right? Well, actually. My gut reaction to this book was that it was racist. I gave it a chance because I thought, it might end up having a racial theme arise somewhere later in the story. But no. Two things made me feel it was racist. One, every time an individual zombie was described (gleefully) as being ripped apart, we were told what race they belonged to. Since this book happened to be set in LA, there were quite a few Asians. He'd also describe if they were blonde or brunette or old or young. But especially the race and especially Asian. Then second, there was the Latino gang that was portrayed as being lead by a single intelligent undead monster. Who could control zombies with his superpower. The gang members were portrayed as animalistic, for the most part, in the most old skool clich\u00e9d gang fashion. Like something from a 70s movie like The Warriors or Mad Max perhaps. Their humanity was not really acknowledged by the author.The racism may very well have been unintentional, and I am not saying the author is personally racist. But I found his book to be racist and expressed joyful detail in tearing apart zombies. Once I noticed it, I felt that subtly, the Asian zombies got it worse than the others. I'm sure it was a...coincidence."}, {"userName": "Zedsdead", "userReviewDate": "Jan 17, 2013", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/8224038-zedsdead", "userReview": "Ex-Heroes is a superheroes-vs-zombies genre mash-up. Los Angeles has been overrun by the living dead. A few heroes have teamed up with a couple thousand civilians to turn Paramount Studios into a walled compound. A large, heavily armed street gang with a grudge against one of the heroes begins making trouble for the good guys.The group's leader is a Batman analog named Stealth. She has no true powers, just a mind like a computer, a strategic and tactical brilliance, and a knack for violence. Second in command is Mighty Dragon/Superman, who flies and is strong and bulletproof and breathes fire. There's also an Iron Man (Cerberus), Rogue (Gorgon), Wolverine (Regenerator), Human Torch (Zzap) and a few others.First, the good stuff:I like the effort Clines has put into the logistics of his heroes...Dragon sort of glides instead of flying like Superman, and if you hit him hard enough he actually bruises. Zzap can't carry anything in his energy form, and his full-spectrum perception is actually a hindrance when hunting cold-blooded exes (zombies). Cerberus has trouble with her battlesuit's power supply. Et cetera.I like the plot construction. Chapters bounce back and forth between \"now\" and \"then\", with then-chapters combining hero-origin with zombie-outbreak stories. Clines rather skillfully uses the early \"thens\" to build his world, and later \"thens\" for plot twists and reveals while still creating character backgrounds.I loved some of the details that went into the characters. A Korean martial artist chooses a Japanese codename (Banzai) because hey, she's just a dumb teenager with no sense of her cultural history. It works. Stealth is basically a high-functioning autistic. A former LA-councilwoman is a fear-mongering troublemaker and rabblerouser because...well, she's not a good person and expects everyone else to be like her.Now, the bad: Peter Clines no rite too gud. In spite of what I've read in some other reviews, I thought the action scenes were a weak point. Good Guy punch Bad Guy, Bad Guy throw Good Guy. Repeat until Clever Resolution.There were disappointing lapses in logic. Zombies leap unconvincingly from nowhere to eat glaringly disposable characters who might as well be wearing red shirts. A squad of Marines gets off a military transport plane and engages in conveniently gory hand-to-hand combat with a flood of exes. They could easily have sent out the invulnerable battle-suited Cerberus to clear some space first.Nevertheless, Ex-Heroes was entertaining and fast-paced, a worthwhile read."}, {"userName": "Lizzy Lessard", "userReviewDate": "Jul 21, 2013", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/8768226-lizzy-lessard", "userReview": "When EX-HEROES mixed super-heroes and zombies, I didn't realize how dumb un-scary zombies would be if there is no threat of dying. Besides the fact that three of the main characters are immune to zombie bites, zombies are incredibly slow and dumb, they\u2019re developing a vaccine to cure everyone of zombie bites so eventually everyone will be immune. Yay. . Zombies are only cool when there's a high likeliness of the entire world's population ending up as zombies. Zombies are not cool when some guy in flashy underwear man-handle zombies like zerglings.This has to be one of the most difficult reviews I've written, because I have almost nothing to say about the book. Why? Because the scenes are repetitive and the set-up for character introduction are redundant.How EX-HEROES unfolds:- Introduce character- Lengthy background- Scene involve the character killing zombies- Introduce next character- Lengthy background- Scene involving the character killing zombies- Repeat 6 more times- Introduce plot for next book- BAM! The end.One thing is for sure. I've never read a zombie novel quite like this one. I would say that at least 80% of the novel was outright zombie killing (zombies are known as ex-es). It's awful that I had not a single ounce of empathy for any of the characters throughout the story. I was shocked by how often little kids were killed, mutilated and/or zombified. It didn't add to the story and it felt like a ploy to get the reader's heartstrings moving.The plot doesn't kick in until the final couple of chapters. If the next book picks up where this one stops, then it stands a good chance of being a decent read. But, EX-HEROES is not a standalone book. It's an introduction to a series. There's a huge character cast and it really kills the pacing of the book (along with several thousands zombies). If you are committed to reading the second book, then you might not mind this. If you'd rather a book that can survive on its own, then feed this one to your pet zombie.(I received a copy of this book from the publisher/Netgalley in exchange for my honest review.)"}, {"userName": "Jim", "userReviewDate": "Dec 08, 2014", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/123475-jim", "userReview": "This is basically a post-apocalyptic zombie book with superheroes, which is an interesting premise.
