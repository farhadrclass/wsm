Had it been published and promoted as a book for youngsters, I would have rated it higher and reviewed it more gently. But it was marketed as an adult book, so I'll rate and review it as such. The writing, plot, and characters aren't all that bad for light fiction. I was able to finish it without hating it, which is increasingly rare for me with fluff novels. THE PROBLEM: There were a lot of opportunities for real depth here. The story could have explored serious issues such as mental illness, a child's loss of her mother, and racial tensions in the South of the 1960s. Hoffman kills every chance for depth and dramatic tension by tidily dispatching every crisis with perfectly worded homilies delivered at just the right moment by just the right character. These little sermons are happily accepted by the other characters, who never raise the issue again. They all float along in saccharine harmony until the next crisis, which will be just as neatly dissolved with another special conversation.Sunshine, lollipops, and rainbows get tediously predictable by about halfway through the book. There are some delightful characters, but they aren't believable when they're so easily swayed and soothed. If you're looking for something sweet and fun and you're less critical of light fiction than I, you will probably find this a wonderful little escape. It has a lot of Southern charm and colorful characters, and there are some quite humorous escapades. I loved the photo journey of Miz Hobbs's remarkable traveling brassiere! Aunt Tootie, Oletta, and Miz Goodpepper are lovable but not very convincing."}, {"userName": "Karla", "userReviewDate": "Mar 31, 2010", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/2428829-karla", "userReview": "I adore this style of writing, dripping with deep southern charm set in the summer of 1967 Savannah, Georgia. What a sparkling gem of a debut for Hoffman. I'm gonna have to compare this book a little because of the age of the main character to Secret Life of Bee's with a 12 year old girl named CeeCee living in Ohio, with her tender heart in shambles after the passing of her mentally-ill mother and having an absent father with no parenting skills. This event changes her life as she moves to live with her wise, little Aunt Tootie and her dearest friend and housekeeper Oletta. Told with a beautiful and unique voice and vividly described setting, wonderful eccentric side characters and neighbors. This is a lush story that squeezes your heart, so full of warmth, humor and charismatic characters so real, you just feel like could run over to sit-and-share with them while sipping Iced sweet tea in Tootie's backyard basking in the aroma of Magnolia and Wisteria blossoms.You just can't help but adore Aunt Tootie, Oletta, Miz Goodpepper and Mrs. Odell these generous, spunky, loveable characters that seem to know just what to do to heal CeeCee's tender broken heart and help her bloom simply by being themselves. CeeCee adds to there lives as well to seal a strong circle of friendship.so touching I was crying, laughing and cheerfully embracing this story that feeds the soul and leaves an intoxicating, aromatic delight of great southern food and exotic flowers.

Ain't nobody walkin' this green earth got a bigger heart than Miz Tootie\". Argh!!

At times the book would take a turn and I would think \"but hasn't this plot line been in so many other books?\" Even the names of the characters are so predictable of a southern novel. That said, I read the book in two days......it captivated me. The characters were strong and story line engaging but what did it for me was the imagery. This book was an indulgent sensual bath- at times leaving me raw and sad and then at others being full of comfort, love and goodness. It's a mentally visual feast full of splendid gardens, old homes, lovely architecture, a first visit to the sea, peacocks, hummingbirds and a host of crazy, colorful, indomitable southern women who know how to cook up some comfort food and tell tall tales. I was not surprised that the author was previously the head of a successful interior design firm. And for someone like me, who loves the aura of old houses and splendor of gardens this book just engaged my senses. Just when it verged on being trite one of the characters would offer pearls of wisdom or insight that were so beautifully stated I would be knocked down. And the underlying storyline about grief and overcoming it is something I understand and am interested in.

There\u2019s nothing wrong with the book per se, but it definitely didn\u2019t live up to my expectations. The story is about CeeCee, a young girl from Ohio whose mother just died. CeeCee goes to live with an aunt in Savannah, Georgia where she meets several eccentric Southern ladies. The story itself was fine, but I didn\u2019t find a lot of substance there. The characters were all interesting enough, but pretty one-dimensional, and the storyline was a little too good to be true. I also felt like CeeCees \u2018voice\u2019 wasn\u2019t that authentic. She came across as way too mature for a 12 year old girl. I just couldn\u2019t see a lot of her thoughts and words coming from a girl that age.

It's definitely not a book I would normally read, but it was one of my group's BOtM so I gave it a try. Despite my initial reluctance to try it, once I started reading I couldn't put it down.CeeCee Honeycutt is a little girl who grew up in a house that was anything but normal. Her mother was constantly going through different moods, she had no friends to speak of, and her father was consistently leaving to go on business trips. When CeeCee's mom dies, her world gets turned upside and she is sent to live with family in Savannah Georgia. There she meets an unbelievable cast of characters that help her discover what life is really about.Each character in this book was unique and entertaining. They each had a different story to tell, and a different lesson to teach CeeCee. At the base level this book is about just about a girl who is trying to keep her life from falling apart, but as you dig deeper there are so many different stories that a person can relate to. Threads of racism, prejudice, philosophy of karma, friendship etc...

And I had a lot of issues with the book that stopped me from really enjoying it:The characters were pretty flat and stereotypical. The benevolent old Southern white society lady who saves her little grand-niece. Her grumpy-but-oh-so-loveable black maid. The smart but troubled young girl. The crazy mother. I was very aware that these were characters, made up by some author. I particularly had issues with the crazy mom. The author clearly tried to give her some depth, but the character just felt so overdone. I tend to be really critical of \"Mentally Ill Mother\" characters because 1) they're a commonly used plot device, and they have to be really well-written to pull it off, and 2) my mother struggled with alcoholism and depression when I was growing up, so I generally either really relate to the stories or it just seems phony to me. In this story, it seemed contrived. I don't know - maybe the author really had experiences like CeeCee's, and maybe some people with mama-issues related to this story, but I sure didn't. There wasn't really any conflict in this story. I guess the conflict was supposed to have been CeeCee coming to terms with the loss of her mother, which I found utterly un-compelling, or the issues related to Oletta and her friends killing a white man, which was neatly wrapped up in a page. But honestly, it was 300 pages of CeeCee living the charmed life in her big rich Southern house with her big rich Southern aunt. Gee, how interesting. And then there was this little gem: \"Northerners have no idea what real living means, and they don't know a damn thing about etiquette or hospitality.\" Oh, whatever. This book romanticizes the South to a ridiculous degree. Maybe it\u2019s just my Minnesota pride talking, but it really grated on my nerves \u2013 and I\u2019m not against Southern charm in novels by any means. But I don\u2019t think moving to the South solves everyone\u2019s problems, and the idea that being in the North caused her mother\u2019s illness and CeeCee\u2019s unhappiness is simplistic and ludicrous. And it alienated me, as a reader, and made me get all defensive. The writing was all right, but it was very deliberate - nothing about this book seemed effortless to me, it all seemed planned and made up. I think in a really good book, it almost seems that the author is channeling the story and the characters instead of making them up - that was not the case with Saving CeeCee Honeycutt.For better, Southern folksy charm books with real substance I would recommend Fried Green Tomatoes at the Whistle Stop Cafe, The Secret Life of Bees, The Help, To Kill a Mockingbird, Divine Secrets of the Ya-ya Sisterhood, or Where The Heart Is. This book wasn't an utter waste of time, it was a simple and pretty quick read, but there are plenty of similar, better books out there."}, {"userName": "Cara", "userReviewDate": "Aug 10, 2010", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/1876075-cara", "userReview": "\"The afternoon sun sent fireworks of light sparkling off the hood ornament- a miniature silver angel with open wings and her arms stretched out in front of her, palms forward, as if she were ready to push aside anything that dared get in her way.\" \nFirst off I want that hood ornament! Sadly they don't put them on cars anymore. *sigh* This quote really jumped out at me because it describes the story as a whole. Ceecee will be protected by the brave, fierce, and beautiful women of Savannah, and they will fight tooth and nail for this girl, just like the angel. Poor Ceecee has had a hard time to say the least. Her crazy mother gets killed. In a way it proves to be a good fortune for her, but just like any other girl she is devasted. Though her mother did more harm then good and many a time she wanted her gone, deep down she knows she always hoped that her mom would someday be a normal mother. Her father is basically out of the picture, and just avoids the whole situation as much as possible. He does do  one  good thing for her; he decides that Ceecee will go to Savannah with her great-aunt Tootie. That one decesion will change Ceecee Honeycutt's life forever.The southern charm always gets to me. Right off the bat I love books with this kind of setting. The story is not only set in the south but in the 1960's. I'm glad the author didn't try to shove down our thoarts the Civil Right movement, but she does give us clear displays that this in fact is happening. It's not the central idea to the novel but is part of the telling how Ceecee comes to see the world through different eyes. The whole cast of women were great. Starting with Oletta all the way to even Viola. It's actually hard to believe there could be so many generous people, but I do want to believe.The only reason why I didn't give it the whole five stars was because it seemed just a tad too perfect. Other than that the story is lovely and makes you smile to see that people could care so much about one girl.

She has no friends, or family that visit, her only real attachment is to an elderly neighbor who has loved and watched over her since she was a baby.

That's pretty much how I felt while reading this story: wrapped up in a comfortable world with colorful characters willing to share their secrets with me. CeeCee is a bright, introspective young woman who absorbs everything she sees and desperately hopes she'll find security with her aunt in Savannah. That's what she seems to crave, more than anything: friendship. Love. Support. Things most of us probably take for granted -- myself included -- but which she has never experienced after caring for her ailing mother for so long. A minor quibble of mine involves CeeCee's ability to think philosophically and well beyond her years one moment, but still say something adolescent and sweetly oblivious the next. Maybe that's the jaded cynic in me bursting forward, but I felt a little annoyed with CeeCee's naivet\u00e9 a few times in the story. CeeCee as a narrator seems much older than CeeCee the character, and that may have been part of my unease. Still, it wasn't a major issue -- and certainly didn't dampen my enjoyment of the story. Lovers of Southern fiction and coming-of-age tales will fall in love with CeeCee and the friends she makes in Georgia, and those of us with a sweet tooth will savor every recipe and dish Oletta lovingly prepares in Aunt Tootie's kitchen. My stomach grumbled so loudly at the mention of Oletta's famous cinnamon buns that I almost had to shove the book aside and make a bakery run. Hoffman's ability to make my stomach gurgle -- and tug at those old heartstrings -- is quite a feat.

After her mother's death, a wealthy great aunt takes her to live in Savannah where Ceecee meets lots of her aunt's friends most of them slightly eccentric.Hoffman's characters are either very very good or very very bad. Her characters seem wooden and predictable. I didn't even feel much for poor little Ceecee. Surely a child who has had such a terrible life as she would turn out a little less than perfect, which she seems to be. Her aunt and her aunt's friends are stereotypes of what people think of wealthy Southerners. Oletta is the black maid who loves her white family (think \"Help\" without the behind the scenes remarks).There are humorous scenes which could have been much better had they not been so outrageous and predictable.

What happens to the racist white man who attacks blacks in a world too quick to believe a bad white man over three good black women?I found this to be a tender, delightful story with characters I came to love.

What a delightful read. It reminds me of a book I read many years ago, Nora, Nora by Anne Rivers Siddons. It has the same small town southern feeling and similar kind-hearted strong women characters. I read in another review\u2014someone compared this book to the movie Steel Magnolias. Yeah, I can see that. I loved character Oletta Jones. She's one of those honest, no-fuss types. \"'Lord, next time I climb this many steps it best be on the stairway to heaven.'\"\"'The devil will invite Jesus to Sunday supper before I give that women a crumb of my cooking.'\"P.S. Alternate title for this book should be, CeeCee Honeycutt and the Traveling Brassiere."}, {"userName": "Erin", "userReviewDate": "Jan 15, 2011", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/3933135-erin", "userReview": "This was my book club's monthly pick, and that was the only reason I finished it. The characters are stereotypes, with one or two quirks tacked on to make them \"eccentric\". The conflict, where it exists at all, is neatly wrapped up so that CeeCee can learn a valuable lesson, PSA-style. The description is overwrought and repetitive (everything is \"sun-dappled\" and looks like \"miles of lace\"), and the voice seems to swing between 8 and 38 years old. There's no real continuing plot; the book is more a collection of anecdotes. Books written that way can be good, but in this book, there are so many that each one seems diluted, quickly glossed over to get to the next scene. Readers aren't given time to connect to the characters, the supporting characters aren't given time to develop, and the main characters don't change at all. Not that they need to-- their flaws are things like being too nice, too optimistic, too forgiving. Ugh. Way too syrupy-sweet girl-power for my taste. By the end of the book, I felt like I was the one who'd been hit by an ice cream truck."}, {"userName": "Melodie", "userReviewDate": "Jan 17, 2012", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/5788507-melodie", "userReview": "The opening blurb on Goodreads \"Steel Magnolias meets The Help\". Apt comparison for sure. Full of Southern charm with the subject of growing up female in the 60's handled tenderly. A slight twist in that the little girl in the story is not southern by birth, coming to live in Savannah after her mother dies in a freakish accident. I found the cast of characters engaging and easy to love or not, and laughed out loud a few times with the antics of the often eccentric but thoroughly charming women. Life lessons and pearls of wisdom abounded on subjects every girl needs to learn,forgiveness, grieving,responsibility,nurturing one's self esteem and finding your passion or fire. I understand this was a debut novel, and I say bravo! I will be looking out for more form this author."}, {"userName": "Donna", "userReviewDate": "Jun 05, 2012", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/2100090-donna", "userReview": "I loved this book.

For years she\u2019s been the caretaker of her psychotic mother, Camille\u2014 the crown-wearing, lipstick-smeared laughingstock of an entire town. Though it\u2019s 1967 and they live in Ohio, Camille believes it\u2019s 1951 and she\u2019s just been crowned the Vidalia Onion Queen of Georgia.The day CeeCee discovers Camille in the front yard wearing a tattered prom dress and tiara as she blows kisses to passing motorists, she knows her mother has completely flipped. When tragedy strikes, Tootie Caldwell, a previously unknown great-aunt comes to CeeCee\u2019s rescue and whisks her away to Savannah. Within hours of her arrival, CeeCee is catapulted into a perfumed world of prosperity and Southern eccentricities\u2014a world that appears to be run entirely by women.While Tootie is busy saving Savannah\u2019s endangered historic homes from the wrecking ball, CeeCee encounters a cast of unforgettable, eccentric characters. From the mysterious Thelma Rae Goodpepper, who bathes in an outdoor tub under the watchful eyes of a voyeuristic peacock, to Oletta Jones, the all-knowing household cook, to Violene Hobbs, the loud-mouthed widow who entertains a local police officer in her yellow see-through peignoir, the women of Gaston Street keep CeeCee entertained and enthralled for an entire summer.But CeeCee\u2019s view of the world is challenged in ways she could have never imagined: there are secrets to keep, injustices to face, and loyalties to uphold. Just as she begins to find her ballast and experiences a sense of belonging, her newfound joy collides with the long-held fear that her mother\u2019s legacy has left her destined for destruction.Laugh-out-loud funny, at times heartbreaking, and written in a pitch-perfect voice, Saving CeeCee Honeycutt is a spirited Southern tale that explores the intricate frailties and strengths of female relationships while illuminating the journey of a young girl who loses her mother but finds many others.", "title": "Saving CeeCee Honeycutt", "url": "https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/6617928-saving-ceecee-honeycutt", "average": 3.92, "cover": "https://images.gr-assets.com/books/1348364490l/6617928.jpg", "reviews": 8201, "authors": [{"url": "https://www.goodreads.com/author/show/63630.Beth_Hoffman", "name": "Beth Hoffman"}, {"url": "https://www.goodreads.com/author/show/655707.Jenna_Lamia", "name": "Jenna Lamia"}], "type": ["Fiction"], "outlinks": ["http://www.goodreads.com/book/show/6617928-saving-ceecee-honeycutt", "http://www.goodreads.com/book/show/6972228-saving-ceecee-honeycutt", "http://www.goodreads.com/book/show/6972261-saving-ceecee-honeycutt", "http://www.goodreads.com/book/show/7931147-saving-ceecee-honeycutt", "http://www.goodreads.com/book/show/9812113-saving-ceecee-honeycutt", "http://www.goodreads.com/book/show/7444255-saving-ceecee-honeycutt", "http://www.goodreads.com/book/show/13366032-saving-ceecee-honeycutt", "http://www.goodreads.com/book/show/16158528-looking-for-me", "http://www.goodreads.com/book/show/39784731-die-frauen-von-savannah", "http://www.goodreads.com/book/show/37555859-ein-laden-der-gl-ck-verkauft", "http://www.goodreads.com/book/show/17789316-of-love-and-life", "http://www.goodreads.com/book/show/16154697-reader-s-digest-select-editions-volume-234-2012-6", "http://www.goodreads.com/book/show/39928984-mercy-among-the-children", "http://www.goodreads.com/book/show/20620995-take-me-with-you", "http://www.goodreads.com/book/show/6565401-five-quarters-of-the-orange", "http://www.goodreads.com/book/show/25600623-the-diver-s-clothes-lie-empty", "http://www.goodreads.com/book/show/18867378-the-traveler-s-gift", "http://www.goodreads.com/book/show/40198373-big-stone-gap", "http://www.goodreads.com/book/show/40198387-friendship-bread", "http://www.goodreads.com/book/show/40193401-the-little-giant-of-aberdeen-county", "http://www.goodreads.com/book/show/35963775-her-sister-s-shoes", "http://www.goodreads.com/book/show/22617980-the-rock-harbor-collection", "http://www.goodreads.com/book/show/35269080-a-thousand-tomorrows", "http://www.goodreads.com/book/show/40204902-caravans", "http://www.goodreads.com/book/show/31192689-shoeless-joe", "http://www.goodreads.com/book/show/40204877-a-hero-of-france", "http://www.goodreads.com/book/show/6473113-death-in-venice", "http://www.goodreads.com/book/show/40266651-the-tilted-world", "http://www.goodreads.com/book/show/33117501-blonde", "http://www.goodreads.com/book/show/36546758-ever-after", "http://www.goodreads.com/book/show/40193580-rescue", "http://www.goodreads.com/book/show/22032837-the-pearl-that-broke-its-shell", "http://www.goodreads.com/book/show/36589911-the-lords-of-discipline", "http://www.goodreads.com/book/show/11963271-the-sheltering-sky", "http://www.goodreads.com/book/show/25596951-the-dressmaker-s-war", "http://www.goodreads.com/book/show/35120598-gena-finn", "http://www.goodreads.com/book/show/29550710-a-charles-martin-collection", "http://www.goodreads.com/book/show/19977229-remember-tuesday-morning", "http://www.goodreads.com/book/show/8530701-a-town-like-alice", "http://www.goodreads.com/book/show/35414455-the-other-alcott", "http://www.goodreads.com/book/show/18800554-the-scavenger-s-daughters", "http://www.goodreads.com/book/show/40205036-under-the-udala-trees", "http://www.goodreads.com/book/show/32861105-the-streets-have-no-king", "http://www.goodreads.com/book/show/39929534-the-passion", "http://www.goodreads.com/book/show/35654710-this-dark-road-to-mercy", "http://www.goodreads.com/book/show/11513574-breath-eyes-memory", "http://www.goodreads.com/book/show/21942189-the-language-of-hoofbeats", "http://www.goodreads.com/book/show/18165412-house-of-bathory", "http://www.goodreads.com/book/show/37984397-we-own-the-sky", "http://www.goodreads.com/book/show/36004055-not-perfect"]}
