Central to the poem is Teebs' drive not to be forced into a traditional nature poem, yet at the same time finding and extricating the deep set connections of modern life to history, human nature, and the earth. This process of bringing to light that which existent society attempts to brush over gives Nature Poem a sense of urgent relevance and vitality that Pico deftly wields throughout its pages. Nature Poem is the reclaimed process of meaning making, links are forged in chains which can only be broken through the will of the narrator, Teebs. The forging and breaking is a matter of knowledge \"or its approximate artifice, [it] is a kind of equilibrium\". An often disheartening process of shifting the tides of that balance, not so much to make things equal as to force the status quo away from those who prosper in its ignorance.In the end Teebs finds himself still communing with nature, but a nature more distributed and realistic to the world beyond his history. The lineage of the Nature poem is mirrored by the lineage of his ancestors. He paradoxically wants both respective forms of his lineage to catch up to the life that could be, while also wishing for the communal sense of belonging that the present day (cities, politics, internet culture and dating, and the myriad forms of marginalization he faces) denies him, and that he often found while growing up.Nature Poem is a refreshing and often searing crucible through which the the merits of both possible lives and existing realities are weighed. Pico has an amazing voice and drive within his work and Nature Poem showcases it brilliantly."}, {"userName": "Will", "userReviewDate": "Jun 01, 2017", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/4833283-will", "userReview": "Ugh, Tommy Pico does it again.

But I am actually very glad I read it. There were many things I took from this poem, namely \"feelings\" more than fully fleshed, academic ideas. So instead of a full review, I'm going to talk about a few of my favorite lines:-\"WHAT'S YR NATIONALITY!?!? This guy shouts at me during drag karaoke...\" (p.9)While this is not a situation I ever find myself in, it's an interesting, and sadly totally real, portrayal of how blunt and awful and racist the white gay male scene can be. It's horrible but necessary to know that we've all probably made someone feel this way, through being oblivious, or just not giving a fuck if we were rude at all. -\"It's disheartening to hear someone say there's 'no magic left' bc I love that YouTube of Amy Winehouse singing 'Love is a Losing Game' at the Mercury Prize Ceremony...\" (p.14)To me, this is any time you encounter something that seems so small and trivial but it makes you have that same sense of awe as when you see an amazing piece in a museum. That sense of wonder from seeing a masterpiece resonates deep, and this is proof it can come from anywhere. I mean, just today I got that feeling listening to a random song I hadn't heard in years. Just dancing to \"Sunday Morning\" by K-Os, and remembering the how young I was when I first heard it felt more dynamic than most of the moments from the last museum trip to see \"great art\" that I took.-\"I meet a boy and I miss him.\" (p.25)Oh the painful truth in this line. So many walks with headphones in being an angsty gay montage from a movie that would most likely be VERY boring and pretentious. -\"Knowing the moon is inescapable tonight and the tuft of yr chest against my shoulder blades -This is a kind of nature I would write a poem about.\" (p.27)Firstly, just a sexy line that made me feel all that 80s rom-com heart-swell. Secondly, reading it, you can feel the memory of being in bed with someone come slamming back like a nostalgia freight train. -\"Body: Don't get too attached to me\" (p.39)What a succinct way to think of the body reminding you that it's all temporary.The whole bit about \"Space Oddity\" where it talks about the opening lines as though they are written as if from a mother and a father, and the crazy difference between the two lines. (p.61)-\"It took tons for me to come to this relationship with even a thin crust mantle of optimism\" (p.63)SAME! (to put it very shortly).-What if I said hi to them in the mornings and now all their calls go to voicemail.\" (p.72)There is this really nostalgic, not all together sad thought of how transient relationships/friendships/ships can be, where someone meant the world, and you couldn't imagine a second of not being in the same universe as them, but now you might simply nod if you saw each other (or more likely, make incredibly uncomfortable small talk).If for whatever reason, you read all that, I am sorry for this glimpse into how I read poetry! But definitely give this a read. It was perfect for the lazy winter day I finally picked it up."}, {"userName": "Sasha", "userReviewDate": "Mar 22, 2017", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/904838-sasha", "userReview": "Tommy \"Teebs\" Pico is an Indian gay man who resents you for thinking that, as someone who grew up on the reservation, you expect him to write poetry about commuting with nature and all that crap. He wants to write about living in New York and trying to get lucky and the tiny things he notices about people and his exasperation and exuberance and complaints and pride and big thoughts and little thoughts.I can't pretend that I get his life, but I can understand that resentment, that just because you're one thing, doesn't mean you'll act a certain way, and maybe stop defining me by that one thing. And I can totally identify with the next feeling that comes after that resentment: the fact that sometimes they happen to be right. Teebs does like nature, okay, and you can shove your opinions about it way up your butt. It's infuriating and you feel like you've been nailed down, defined, when in fact they have you wrong or they only know a teeny tiny piece of your life, an insignificant part, and are too smug about how well they've pegged you to care finding out the much bigger parts. I don't think I've ever quite seen this emotion written down, so it's a seminal work in that sense. I like this a lot!

I could have read the entirety of this work in a single sitting, but it would have been an absolute shame to not take my time and savour it. Nature Poem comes from the refreshingly frank, honest and grounded point of view of an LGBTQ+, Indigenous, early-millennial at this moment in time. As an LGBTQ+, early-millennial, there was a lot of Pico\u2019s prose that resonated with me. As a person who works almost exclusively with Indigenous communities, I think that there is a lot to learn from Pico\u2019s perspective on inter-generational trauma, colonialism, loss of identity and systemic racism. I really love that he doesn\u2019t slow-walk you to a toned-down message that is more palatable to the general public. His words also don\u2019t get lost in hostility, which makes his vulnerability really powerful. It\u2019s really a beautiful thing to read.For me, Tommy Pico (and his collaborator Morgan Parker, who I LOVE) represents such an exciting movement in poetry and the literary arts.

It's a point of view that is totally unique and sorely lacking from both the Native American and outdoor writing canons.The poem is probably not for everyone -- it does use abbreviations and turns of phrase from Twitter and Tumblr as well as the queer world -- but if you're open enough to modern poetry to not get turned off by \"what the kids are talking about,\" you'll really enjoy this.
