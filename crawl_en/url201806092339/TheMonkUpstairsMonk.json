His writing combines deep, wide compassion with a sharp ear for verbal banter and an ironic, nimble sense of humor. His sensibility seems very Buddhist to me; the heart of his fiction is the idea that everything changes and ends, and yet all of the chaos and fluctuations of life and death are ultimately manifestations of Love. His works often deal with people dying, and this book is no exception."}, {"userName": "Harry Allagree", "userReviewDate": "Apr 27, 2013", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/8488865-harry-allagree", "userReview": "For me, Tim Farrington's first novel,The Monk Downstairs, was like a religious experience. Not only did I read it twice, I also based a whole retreat on it in 2005 for a group of Affiliates of the Order of Julian of Norwich. Only recently did I learn about his sequel, published in 2007, The Monk Upstairs. It continues the saga of the relationship of an ex-monk, Mike, with a young, savvy, witty, but disgruntled divorc\u00e9e, Rebecca, who has a precocious daughter, Mary Martha, and a very hip mother, in the best sense: Phoebe. This second novel about the family takes place after Mike & Rebecca are married. If you read & finish the novel, go back to frontispiece page where there's a quote from St. Augustine's Confessions: \"But what mystery there lay in 'The Word was made Flesh,' I could not even imagine.\" That, in a nutshell, is the meaning of the story. Farrington's writing is so un-novellike to me: it's more like an extended wise and deep spiritual meditation on the meaning of life and relationship. This second novel deals primarily with Phoebe, and Farrington's descriptions are sometimes breathtakingly perceptive. One example: \"Phoebe looked beautiful, serene, and oddly poised, like an autumn leaf leaking its last bit of color before it fell...\" (p. 196). Bring a box of tissues with you as you read the book; Farrington will grab your heart and move you to tears...as he did me, for the last four chapters!"}, {"userName": "Claire", "userReviewDate": "Jul 15, 2008", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/1332973-claire", "userReview": "This book had a different tone than the first, but still felt like a very real picture of the characters and what they were going through. Again, I was surprised by how much I was pulled into their story and how much I sympathized with their troubles and failures. Again, too, the best part of the book was how quietly contemplative it was, how utterly real yet soft it was. Flaubert writes with a realism that's like a harsh fluorescent light: it exposes everything without mercy and almost makes a mockery of humans for wishing there were shadows, for in shadows lie romance and mystery. Farrington writes with a realism that's a little softer. Perhaps his realism is more like dawn--just as powerful, just as illuminating, but acknowledging the shadows cast by the objects in the story. Farrington's novel acknowledges that there is mystery in life--that's one of the reasons his character of ex-monk works so well. He's not preachy but philosophical, and it's very easy to take the religion out of the work and instead contemplate the mysteries of life and everything that we do not know."}, {"userName": "Christa", "userReviewDate": "Dec 06, 2008", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/261662-christa", "userReview": "I thoroughly enjoyed The Monk Downstairs, the prequel to this book, and I was glad to find that I liked The Monk Upstairs even more. I found this book to be very touching. The main characters were entirely sympathetic, and I enjoyed reading about how they melded and established a life together. Michael is a very unusual but wonderful hero, and Rebecca is a likeable heroine. These two books have made me a fan of Tim Farrington, and I will be reading more by him.The Monk Upstairs begins on the wedding day of Mike and Rebecca. After Rebecca coaxes Mike to the ceremony almost an hour after it should have begun, they are married and have some wonderful days in Hawaii before life intrudes. Rebecca finds that being married again isn't always easy, especially when the groom was a monk for twenty years. She has some doubts that they can really make the marriage work, which causes Rebecca to pull away and sometimes shut Mike out. They are faced with the steadily declining health of Rebecca's mother, and Mike's lack of qualifications for the job market. Rebecca's ex husband, Rory, and his new wife are often on the scene as Rory tries to reform and leave his drug days behind. Rebecca has to come to terms with the changes in her life while Mike continues to adjust to living in the \"real\" world.This was a great book. For most of the story, Mike faced his new life with his usual equanimity. He was calm and composed while dealing with the situations he faced. I loved the intereaction between Mike and Rebecca, and thought that it was overall, a very sweet, emotional book."}, {"userName": "Jennifer (JC-S)", "userReviewDate": "Sep 15, 2007", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/283014-jennifer-jc-s", "userReview": "I really enjoyed this novel, and have given it 5 stars in my review at Amazon.com:http://tinyurl.com/ytcsm2For those who are not familiar with Tim Farrington, I suggest reading 'The Monk Downstairs' first because you will meet most of the major characters there.This is a novel about relationships, changing roles and life itself.

It is a story about life, death and renewal. It is a story of self discovery. It is beautifully framed in the wonder of the scriptures.

This caused me to really notice Farrington's writing style. His descriptions were vivid and unusual. He wrote skillfully from a variety of adult perspectives, including some moving passages from the point of view of a stroke victim. A beautiful story of grown-up love.

Perhaps 3 1/2 stars...I think it was kind of an easy read but laced with serious religious and life contemplating thought. Upon reflection not truly believable as fiction goes but the writing was above average. The dialogue, inner and outer was well done. Not the deepest novel but not a mindless read either (I feel Twiglight series to be in the \"mindless read\" genre). I found the characters commonly relatable and sympathetic. Never thought saying and believing that would sound so droll and boring. My point: it made it easier to read and find out what is happening with those two again.

All the main characters are back with Rebecca and Mike as the main characters. Character and the theme of religion are most important in the novel. Mike is a saint in the making, patient, tender, unfailingly kind & unselfish, but according to the world useless. Phoebe embodied courage & natural dignity; her humor & her faith touched everyone every day. Rebecca is made better by Mike, but she has mellowed and treats her ex-husband Rory better than before. She also learns to like Rory's new wife. To Mike life is carrying the cross we\u2019re given up the hill in front of us. All we can do is keep on going. According to Mike \u201cAll the world was the temple of the Lord, and every moment was as holy as every other.\u201d (98) To Mike, God didn\u2019t care a bit what material goods you\u2019d piled up, & never had, He only cared what you\u2019d spent or good works you had done. Rebecca wondered what it actually took to change a life, how deep one really had to go, what price one had to pay. Bob\u2019s God was a genial mid-level managerial type.

I remember liking it (though I checked it out from the library and have no review written on BookCrossing, so can't recall specifics.) But the general feeling was positive enough that when I saw this book on the \"New Books\" shelf, I picked it up. It is a book that combines many elements that again interest me: spirituality, love, mother-daughter relations for starters. As part of the plot, the adult daughter is confronted with her own mother's growing frailty after a stroke and the mother's journey/transition preparation from this world into whatever lies beyond. It is a gentle handling of a path I find myself starting down. As my own mother's days become more ephemeral, I wonder how the actual transition will be, what key life will modulate to and if I'll still be able to find the melody and recall the tune. She spends a lot of time resting now-- her days are more cat-like, curled up in naps in the daylight hours and prowling at night. There was a passage in this book which really struck home with me:Rebecca has no idea how long it had taken her to notice. It might have been a minute or two, certainly not more than five minutes: a little spell of absorption in the painting, a meditation on how the sea met the sky, a play of green and gray and blue. It was long enough, she knew, that she would always feel the pain of not having noticed sooner. In any case, she had become aware at some point that it had been a while since Phoebe had spoken or moved, and she glanced over at her.And had seen instantly that everything had changed. The slump was subtle, as was the slight sagging on the right side of her mother's face, but the overall effect was as obvious as a tire going flat. It made Rebecca realize how much her basic sense of her mother's appearance had altered, how quickly you grew accustomed to the most radical changes in someone, What seemed unbearable debilitation at first became the new norm in time , and you came to count on it in its turn and even, weirdly, to treasure it; and every further undoing was a new and painful loss. In the blink of an eye the speech-slurred, awkward, infinitely slow Phoebe of a moment before seemed like the shining image of a vanished heartiness. she had been dim and wan, and now was gray enough to make dim and wan seem bright; and her dreamy, drifting gaze, so unnerving for so long, had gone unnervingly vacant.Not that we're anywhere near there yet, but I do understand that when the time comes, I'll probably be the one to find her...It does give one pause to realize that."}, {"userName": "Jeff Zell", "userReviewDate": "Jan 26, 2017", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/34180126-jeff-zell", "userReview": "This story stands by itself but it begins where The Monk Downstairs leaves off. Mike, the former monk of twenty years who was the renter downstairs in the mother-in-law apartment is now living upstairs with Rebecca. Rebecca\u2019s mother Phoebe is now downstairs. The recovery from her stroke leaves her independent but needing a watchful eye and helping hand. Rebecca wants her close. The story begins at Mike\u2019s old monastery. Rebecca finally consented to marriage with Mike. The guests are seated in the nave. The abbot waits patiently to preside at the wedding liturgy. The bride waits nervously for the start of the service, but there is no groom. Where is he? A preliminary search by others does not find him. Rebecca finally finds him in his old prayer chapel deep in the woods lost in meditation. Rebecca brings Mike back to regular time and the service commences. As we follow Mike and Rebecca through their honeymoon and then back into their regular lives we see Mike and Rebecca grow and mature. Rebecca\u2019s ex and father of Mary Martha begins to exhibit behavior of a responsible father and husband. Phoebe fades into her eternal rest. As in the Monk Downstairs we are treated to thoughtful human dialogue, examination of relationships, and theological reflection through the interaction with Holy Scripture and the writings of St. John of the Cross.

It would be a hard feat to sustain the experience of the first novel, The Monk Downstairs, into the sequel. I rated the first five stars, loved it. I found the sequel uneven, slow start, but still there is much food for thought here, on the messiness of everyday life, the balancing act between loving, earning a living, being honest an open to all that life may throw at us. I really like monk Mike's take on religion. His intuitive common sense when it comes to teaching his step-daughter's catechism class. Still, Mike needs his daily retreat into the contemplative habit, he is still a monk grappling with the complexities of communion with the world along with his God. Yes, this sequel does have a lot to offer in continuing the story; and not the least in the touching telling of Phoebe's end of life journey.
