I am interested the stories of German citizens during this time period. It is easy to judge them in hindsight, but I am curious about their thoughts, actions and reactions as the Nazis rise to and take power. I appreciate the author\u2019s efforts to eliminate hindsight from her writing so she could truly explore her characters\u2019 situation and fears. I gave this book four stars, but I warn you, it is a difficult read because the author does an incredible job of transporting you to the Kappus home that hard winter. I identified with Liesl as she struggled to keep her three step sons fed, warm and safe. As she worried about her husband, a doctor at a hospital, and her fear that he would desert to come home at her request. I was so transported to the small town of Hannesburg that at times I just had to put the book down because I wanted to sob from feeling overwhelmed and defeated. Those negative emotions are the results of great writing."}, {"userName": "Mandy", "userReviewDate": "Sep 24, 2013", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/5859680-mandy", "userReview": "This compelling and very moving book focuses on the Kappus family. Frank is a reconstructive surgeon called away on military duty, leaving his young second wife Liesl at home with his 3 small children from his first marriage. Almost overwhelmed at times by the struggle to survive in wartime with its shortages, the constant air raids and being forced to share her house with some less than congenial refugees, Liesl does what it takes to keep her family together and safe. Her biggest challenge is the middle child, whose psychological state is not only a concern on a personal level but also because of the Nazi regime\u2019s attitude to the damaged and disabled. This results in the very real fear that the child may be taken from her and placed in Hadamar, a home for the handicapped and where his fate would almost certainly be horrific.This is very much a behind-the-scenes story of what it was like for ordinary Germans coping with wartime conditions, how torn apart ordinary families were and the conflicts they had to face about the regime and their country, and their complicity or otherwise in what was going on. It\u2019s a very human story, and Liesl is unforgettable as not only a very real character but also as a symbol of motherhood and sacrifice. Disaster seems to be just around the corner the whole way through the novel, making for an unsettling and tense read, and one that lingers long after reaching the last page.My thanks to Netgalley for sending me a copy."}, {"userName": "Kathryn Bashaar", "userReviewDate": "Jan 07, 2014", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/994755-kathryn-bashaar", "userReview": "I find it often happens that I read 2 or 3 books in a row that are similar in some way. I read a lot so it might just be coincidence, but I wonder if there's something I'm subconsciously trying to learn more about when that happens. Anyway, I've just read 2 books in a row about the effect of war on families, Wake, and now Motherland. Both books focus primarily on war's impact on women and thus (unsurprisingly) deliver an anti-war message. The titles of both books have multiple meanings. Motherland, of course, refers to the country of your birth, which is significant in war. But I took an additional meaning from the title. Liesl marries a widowed surgeon right before he is drafted into the German Army to repair war-damaged soldiers. So she is left to care for his 3 sons, whom she must learn to know, come into conflict with, and begin to fiercely love. She is new to the world of mothering ('mother-land') and learns it under the harrowing conditions in Germany in early 1945 as both the Americans and the Russians close in. The author also makes a contrast between motherland and fatherland as the national \"parent\" as the mighty Third Reich Fatherland falters and the German people must fall back on caring for each other in a more motherly way.Another similarity between this book and Wake was that both books contain a character who is damaged by war and wanders off in a way. I couldn't help but make the connection to the current controversy over poor Bowe Bergdahl. This is one of the things I love the most about reading: making connections, both between different books, and with other people who have read the same things I've read - and now with readers of my own newly-published novel The Saint's Mistress."}, {"userName": "Barbara", "userReviewDate": "Feb 24, 2014", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/11701608-barbara", "userReview": "3.5 stars: An interesting historical fiction work of WWII.

While it\u2019s easy for all of us to sit in judgment in our comfy homes on our comfy couches, most of us, thankfully, do not understand the trauma that basic citizens were under when their country went to war, for reasons that they didn\u2019t always understand.

The author\u2019s grandfather was a reconstructive surgeon in Germany who lost his wife in childbirth and remarried a young woman soon thereafter. When he was drafted into military service he had to leave his three young sons with his new wife. Letters passed back and forth. These letters were secreted in an attic wall for fifty years before they were found and returned to the family. Author Maria Hummel is the granddaughter of this German surgeon...so she tells this story in novel form from a German perspective and it is based on actual happenings that the author\u2019s father and grandparents experienced. This intrigued me. However, for me this book has several drawbacks. First, it was work to read this book. The author definitely set a dark wartime mood but I felt there were many awkward, unclear sentences and passages....somewhat bumpy writing. There was one sentence that was completely garbled and oddly punctuated which somehow escaped the editor. The desire to unravel the medical mystery in the story and curiosity about the family\u2019s outcome were the only reasons to keep reading. Second, I do NOT think the author really treated her story with an accurate rendering of what her German characters knew about what was really going on in their own country regarding the murder of Jews and other undesirables. The word \u201cJew\" was barely mentioned in this book. I think author Hummel understandably wanted to paint her grandparents with a non-judgmental eye, but it only made them look pathetically ignorant of what was going on nearly under their nose. The mother in this story had worked at a spa patronized by Nazi officials in high command before she married the doctor (the author\u2019s grandfather) who visited there. She didn\u2019t overhear anything of what was going on? At one point the neighbor who lives in the villa just yards away and has ties high in the Nazi Party moves a large shipment of crates into his house....no curiosity about these unusual goings-on? (Hint: Think \u2018paintings\u2019....)The doctor (her grandfather) worked at a hospital very close to Buchenwald and did not know what was going on? The staff never talked amongst themselves? I did not buy this pretense at ignorance and I was sorry that the author felt she had to paint them as such duped citizens of Nazi Germany. Her goal, I guess, was to tell the story of her grandparents\u2019 particular struggle during this dark season of wartime, but I fear that it greatly pales alongside what was happening to other grandparents who happened to be of Semitic heritage. I\u2019m not sure whether there is a \u2018good\u2019 or redemptive way to write this very personal story, given the complicity of most German citizens in one of history's most destructive rampages."}, {"userName": "Denise", "userReviewDate": "Jan 31, 2014", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/1321103-denise", "userReview": "This was an excellent story about an \"ordinary\" German family (aka non political) living under Nazi rule, subject matter that fascinates me. It was based upon the stories and letters of the author's father and paternal grandparents. It is not only extremely readable and entertaining, but it is very well written, authentic and factual. It was hard to put down.I am speculating that the book title is \"Motherland\" because of the fact that the women basically ran the households (and everything else) during the war while the men were off fighting. In this particular story, a young woman married a newly widowed surgeon with three children. The surgeon almost immediately got drafted and left her to raise his children and run the household, no easy task with food shortages and shortages of every other kind. I often wonder how the women ever managed it.I highly recommend this to fans of good WW 2 historical fiction or to anyone who simply enjoys a really good story."}, {"userName": "Billyf27", "userReviewDate": "Jan 05, 2014", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/655049-billyf27", "userReview": "I just finished Motherland and can't stop thinking about it.

The letters belonged to the author's grandfather.These events are the basis of the novel \"Motherland\". Maria Hummel does a great job of telling the story in an impartial way (I used to think, \"HOW could the German citizens NOT know what was happening?\" now I think I understand why...), while, at the same time providing the reader with such genuine-ness in characters that they are caught up in the story and can't help reading to find out what happens!\"She couldn't name the day it started to change - maybe the afternoon she'd met Frank, or maybe eavesdropping on the Hadamar doctor, or maybe when the quiet, gentle piano player disappeared because he was rumored to have Jewish blood. Maybe it was the first air ride siren, or the tenth....... at some point after 1940, after Paris fell and London was burning, a new kind of etiquette swept through them all like a chilly wind. Suddenly trust and good faith were out of fashion, and it was more seemly to be careful about what you said and to whom you said it. Imperceptibly, Liesl's anxiety deepened, worsened as the Wehrmacht began to lose instead of win, as more citizens were drafted to military projects in the east, and gaunt, dull-eyed gangs of political prisoners fixed the streets...A wrong word might get you a bad assignment. Liesl found her eyes shifting from side to side as she spoke, checking to see who was listening.\"The author has done a great job of writing about the lives of ordinary German citizens and involving the reader in the sad events of the latter end of WW2. Not a pretty story, but one of hardship, survival, family love and sacrifice, and one that will make the reader think and consider how life might have been for thousands of German citizens who did not support Hitler's regime in wartime but had to live with the ramifications of those in power.\"You know what I do?\" said Frau Winter as Liesl poured the milk, wincing as the glass burned her fingertips. It was too hot.From the rooms above she heard Jurgen begin to cry.\"No,\" Liesl snapped. She topped off the bottle with cold milk from the icebox. Was it still too hot? She couldn't tell.\"I think they are running around and around because they are looking for their father,\" said Frau Winter. \"And they can't find him anywhere.\"Their father. She tested the milk with her finger. She couldn't tell.The baby's cry shook her skull.\"And so I tell them that Fuhrer is their father.

Many were about Jewish experiences during the Holocaust, others about Nazi-occupied countries or areas throughout Europe. Motherland is the first novel I've read from the perspective of non-Jewish Germans living in the heart of Nazi Germany. For me, this was a bit like reading a childhood favourite as an adult where nothing is as I remembered it. The author herself puts it best in her acknowledgements: \"Hindsight is always a delicate issue in historical novels. The author and the reader often have a distilled set of facts about an era that the characters do not possess. Perhaps no era is more traveled and judged by readers than WWII, and so we collectively assume that all books about Germans in the 1940s will be books about complicity or resistance to their government's murderous practises. In fact, most books are. The narrative we get is the one we expect.\" Refreshingly, Hummel presents us with quite the opposite in Motherland.Hummel's acknowledgements also offer another layer of depth to the novel - the fact that her story was inspired by her own family's history, and specifically, by her grandparents' letters to each other during the last few years of the war.Though the first half of the novel alternates between the separate lives of a newly married husband (Frank) and wife (Liesl) - one stationed at a hospital as a surgical resident, the other at home trying to care for her grieving stepchildren - the second half is mainly about Liesl and the children. At its heart, the novel is about what people are willing to do to save their family members, a kind of German Cold Mountain. This is what made Motherland such a page-turner. There's not much wartime fighting or enemy combat, it's simply about the struggle of the people left behind - and what they must do to survive.The most interesting aspect of the book for me was the discussion around the treatment of children with intellectual or cognitive disabilities. About what the state was also doing to fellow Germans, even fellow Aryans, who were deemed \"unfit to live.\"Overall, this was a deeply compelling and poignant novel told from a unique perspective. While it was sometimes a difficult read emotionally, I found myself staying up late to find out what would happen next. I would recommend Motherland to historical novel junkies and lovers of literary dramas in a heartbeat."}, {"userName": "Sharon Brown", "userReviewDate": "Jan 22, 2014", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/9954399-sharon-brown", "userReview": "Somehow, I read this not realizing that it was based on the author's family.

Some reviewers have criticized the author for not squarely dealing with the issue of culpability. Apparently it's inconceivable to them that the German people could have been completely in the dark about what was happening to the Jews. The author herself in the afterword explains that she was trying to avoid portraying the average German as either collaborator or resistor. This book offers what is probably a more realistic depiction of ordinary lives lived in extraordinary times.I thought it illustrated the dilemma that ordinary citizens find themselves in when their nation goes to war (especially when it started the war). It made me think about how I react to less than flattering aspects of my government's actions and policies, whether it's waterboarding at Guantanamo Bay or refusing to address social ills like poverty and racism. I deplore them, but feel powerless to do anything about them. Government has the power to steamroll over individual liberties and civil rights and there's very little the average citizen can do to curtail that power. Non-Germans like to think that they wouldn't have been complacent about what was being done to the Jews during WWII, but what would or could they have done about it?The main character in this book, Liesl, is struggling to keep her family's head above water and the author does a good job of showing how all-encompassing that struggle was. She didn't have the time or the wherewithal to join the resistance, for instance. She was responsible for three young children while her husband was away. Food was scarce, air raids were common, refugees were pouring into the town and people's homes, and you always had to be careful that you weren't attracting the attention of the Nazi Party. Liesl admits that she didn't pay that much attention to what was happening to the Jews--but that was partly because there was so little that she could do about it. We all have our blind spots when it comes to social ills: we don't want to see what's going on around us because we feel powerless to do anything about it. Homelessness, poverty, racism, climate change--who among us feels that he or she has the power to change any of these things? We may denounce them and shake our heads about them, but how much can we actually do?That's why I felt that the book deserved four stars. It makes the reader ask the question: what would I have done differently under the same circumstances? There is no happy ending to this story, no neat resolution--and that in itself should tell us something."}, {"userName": "Bonnie", "userReviewDate": "Feb 13, 2014", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/1602827-bonnie", "userReview": "Motherland examines the life of one German family during World War II. Frank Kappus is a reconstructive surgeon who lost his wife in childbirth and married Liesl who must look after his baby and two older sons when he is drafted into medical military service. She tries to keep the children fed with dwindling food supplies and keep them safe from constant Allied air attacks. Hummel does an excellent job of letting the reader see into the apartment house that must be shared with other families, of the constant threat of air raid attacks, and the never ending search for food to feed the two older boys and procure milk for the baby. In one scene, the two boys, Hans and Ani, help dig a tunnel between the basement in their house and the one next door to be used as a source of escape. When Ami begins to unravel, Liesl must discover the source of the boy's infirmity or lose him to Hadamar, the infamous institution for \"unfit\" children. The novel valiantly shows the shame and courage of Third Reich families during the devastating last days of the war. The novel was inspired by stories from Maria Hummel's father and his German childhood and letters between her grandparents that were hidden in an attic for fifty years. The author tries to illustrate the pride Germans felt at the beginning of the Third Reich and the horrifying end when the truth comes out about the horrors inflicted on millions of people.

This is a story of motherhood and the strength of women, who had to save their children, heal their men and bring them back to dignity, clear the rubble and dust from their homes and generally deal with extremely difficult living. The title itself is a contradictory play on Hitler's use of \"fatherland.\" The fact that Hummel used real family stories of her grandparents and some of their letters make this fiction story more meaningful, and I applaud her ability to fictionalize the vague outline of the story into real characters and moments. Hummel had to choose to make them true to the ordinariness of their lives, not making them into statements about Nazis or the horrors of that regime.
