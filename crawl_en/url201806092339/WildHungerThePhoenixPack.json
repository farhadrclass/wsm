So you've been warned. I love her writing.I love her humor.I love her strong, self aware and confident female leads. I love her ridiculously sexy alpha males. I just love everything, folks. I don't even care that a lot of her books resemble each other. Everyone always smells like exactly three mixes of random shit, e.g., mint, jasmine, and the ocean breeze...or dark chocolate, berries, and frothy cappuccino...nutmeg, cinnamon, and spring fucking grass...whatever any of that actually smells like. Who knows. Every female lead is VERY similar and makes very similar - and yet hilarious - one-liner jokes about Greta's age. To be blunt: all of Wright's books - especially her shifter books - follow a formula to some degree. This bothers some people who want every book to be completely original and life changing, blah, blah blah. But again... Cause you know what I like? I like a sure thing. I like knowing that I am going to pick up a Wright book and get EXACTLY what I want:Fated shifter mates.OTT alpha males. Awesome female leads whom I love and relate to SO much. Crazy hot sex scenes. And a decent plot to tie it all together. All that said, I definitely enjoyed this newest installment. Trick and Frankie were a cute couple and I enjoyed how they came together. I also enjoyed reading about how Frankie dealt with certain issues in the book. So many times, certain characters will allow other characters in a book to treat them like shit and manipulate them to all ends; but not so here. Frankie stood up for herself and her boundaries through every turn and, like I said, I just dig that Wright makes her females so self-aware and confident and yet doesn't make them TSTL and \"I'm a strong woman *stomps foot like five year old*\" like so many other authors do in an effort to make them seem so.

She is one of my favorite authors in the paranormal romance world. I know when I get one of her books that I will be in my happy zone. Wild Hunger was as awesome as I hoped. I have been waiting for Trick's book for so long. I will be honest and say that I thought Trick's mate would have been male. I was looking forward to a good M/M shifter read, but I wasn't disappointed in the way things turned out. I ended up loving Trick and Frankie. \nTrick was everything I love in my paranormal heroes. He was supportive, sexy, dominant, and completely kicked ass. Frankie was sassy, brave, and funny. I loved that she was open and honest. I also really love that they didn't fight the mating bond or take forever to figure it out. It was sweet that even though they knew they were mates they didn't actually mate right away but instead got to know each other and had a real relationship, dates and such. Trick gave Frankie time to deal with everything going on in her life. They were just so good together. I also really enjoyed the plot.

No that's a big fat lie !! I have been waiting to read Trick's book, ever since I read that naughty little scene in \"Feral Sins\"\u00a0(book 1), when Trick and Marcus got down together !! Wow that was awesome ;)Now so far, Marcus and Roni's book has been my favorite and this is still the case after reading Trick's book...but...he is definitely a very close second !! I should have known he was gonna be awesome. Out of all the men in the Phoenix pack, he was always been the relaxed one, the one who wanted to find his true mate. I loved how he helped Marcus out\u00a0 with advice about Roni in \"Dark Instincts\"\u00a0, and Marcus did pay him back big time in this book.See those of you who have read the previous books in this series, know that Marcus and Trick used to scratch each others itches. It had nothing to do with romance though. Even though they don't get down like that anymore...they are still the best of friends and Marcus does prove this more than once in this book.Which only made me love him more, if that's possible ;)Trick has always been open to finding his true mate and bonding, so it's no surprise, that when he does come face to face with her...he knows...right away. There is no case of signal blocking when it comes to Trick and I found this very very refreshing !!As for the heroine, she is half human half shifter. Until she was three, she lived in same pack as the old Phoenix gang (including Trick). This is when her shifter father killed her human mother, and himself after. That's when her maternal grandparents took her away. She has been living in the human world ever since, only shifting every now and then to let her wolf out, but not knowing about packlife.Her grandparents never told her the truth about all that's happend, and when Frankie finds out she she is livid. She also finds out that she was a witness, but somehow her three year old self has suppressed all her memories....She might not know that much about wolves and living in a pack, but she does know that her extreme reaction towards Trick, is not normal. It doesn't take her long to figure out they are \"True Mates. For her, there are some signal blocks getting in the way of their bond, but this is to be expected. She doesn't deny Trick though, and again...this was very refresing...No push and pull and no games. These two really were a breath of fresh air ;)They were also very HOT !!! I knew Trick was gonna be HAWT !!There is a lot more going on in this book, but I am not gonna kiss and tell about everything. You should just give this series a go !! I promise you won't be sorry.I don't recommend reading this book as a stand alone. It might be possible, but you would also miss out on so much information and greatness !!! I highly recommend this entire series !!\u00a0\n\n  My reviews are posted on DirtyBooksObsession    Follow Us on\u27a6"}, {"userName": "Aisling Zena", "userReviewDate": "Feb 09, 2018", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/18444439-aisling-zena", "userReview": "4.5 stars7/5/18 Review now posted.Suzanne Wright can write about anything and I'll read it and love it. She can make mates out of a capybara and a tortoise and I'll still think it's the bomb because she's simply that good, for me.Here, we may not have an unlikely pairing like her previous book (raven and wolf) but it was an interesting one nevertheless. It was also quite refreshing. SW follows a particular formula in her books and I love it but you've come to know more or less what to expect. In this book we had one major difference. Trick recognises and accepts that Frankie is his mate on sight so we don't have to jump through a ton of hoops and realisations to see our couple get together. He decides to make himself indispensable to her and win her over, not by barrelling to her in typical shifter fashion but slowly showing her with his actions that he'll be there for her and always will be.\"I know you're feeling like you're being pulled in different directions, but I'm the one person you don't have to try to please, because you please me by just existing. You're my priority. You get me?\"Frankie herself was also a refreshing element. She might be a dominant wolf but she was raised by her relatively conservative human family so for all intends and purposes she behaves like a human. She is in harmony with her wolf but doesn't display many of the traits of a dominant female wolf. And even though her wolf tests Trick, her resistance wasn't to the levels we usually read from the dominant females. (I said before I really want to see what Suzanne Wright can do with a human-shifter pairing or a truly submissive(Shaya doesn't count as she's not truly submissive)-dominant pair. ) Frankie is fiercely independent with a strong personality and has forged her own path despite the many objections and put-downs from her family.I also enjoyed this one more in the sense that I could remember all of them as I have recently been \"re-reading\"(listening to the audio versions, Jill Redfield is fantastic for first time listeners like me) the series.We have a mystery that unfolds from Frankie's past and I don't know what it says about me that I immediately knew one of the baddies upon introduction as they hadn't shown any signs or said anything suspicious to set me down that path. Maybe I read way too much Agatha Christie as a teen. My brain just works in suspicious ways now. I wouldn't be surprised if I go to a restaurant and my brain yells \"The waiter did it\". The packs (Phoenix and Mercury) unite again against a common enemy, this time Morelli is being an even bigger pest than in the previous book. The wolves are trying to figure out his motives and are not pleased with what they find. Things come to a head but I have a feeling the problem wont stop any time soon. It seems whenever our wolves cut off one head, another appears. Much like fighting a Hydra. Not that I am complaining, more heads means more books which makes me one happy camper. As I have said many times before please do read this author. Especially if you love shifter books. They are the perfect blend of OTT Alphaness and Independent Heroine with a dash of destined mates and a sprinkling of danger and action.** ARC kindly provided via NetGalley in exchange for an honest review1/5/18The begging worked!!

And Wild Hunger proves why she's the best at writing this genre. This story completely sucked me in and captivated me from start to finish. I love this Pack and the characters we've met throughout all of the books, and Trick was no different. I loved the sweetness of him waiting for Frankie to be ready to admit that he's her mate. Instead of being all growly and intense with her like I've kind of come to expect from these shifters he was patient and understanding to her situation and I adored it. I think it was actually somehow hotter than a big bad alpha (small a, not Alpha of the pack) male. I was obsessed with Frankie from the very beginning but I honestly can't point on what it was that made me like her so much. Her whole vibe was just amazing to read about and I thought she was the perfect fit for the Phoenix Pack. I admired her strength of going into such an unknown situation a lot and I liked that we got to see her fight through her vulnerability to do that. I felt like her character was one of the more complex ones of this series but getting to see all the different aspects of life was amazing. As always there was a Pack story going on that focused on everyone and not just the main characters. I really like that there are always these connecting stories so that we can see more of the Pack without them taking over the story or being mentioned so much that it makes you lose focus of who the story is actually about. Overall, everything about the book was very fun and enjoyable to read about. It has me itching to get more from this series and also the Mercury Pack series. I'm just not patient when it comes to these wolves.ARC kindly provided in exchange for an honest review."}, {"userName": "Elizabeth", "userReviewDate": "Apr 23, 2018", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/27276528-elizabeth", "userReview": "\"When I'm sure that you're ready, I'll come for you.\"\nWild Hunger is the seventh book of The Phoenix Pack.

I floved this one, and Wild Hunger is the exact example of why I love a good paranormal romance. SW brought the heat, pack, loyalty, hot alpha males, sassy females, action, suspense and a whole lot of snark. I found myself snorting at some of the one-liners, and don\u2019t even get me started on Greta drunk singing!I fell so hard for Trick, he\u2019s the perfect alpha male. Strong, protective, totally open to Frankie and their mating bond and best of all \u2013 he listened and he heard her. Trick was everything Frankie never even knew she needed and these two were off the charts sizzling hot together. They really worked as individuals and as a couple and this is why I really do love SW\u2019s characters.Feral Sins will probably always be my favourite SW book, but Wild Hunger runs a pretty damn close second.

I love Suzanne Wright, she has a very specific formula that has worked for her so far. This is both good and bad.Why?When I first read Feral Sins (book number one in this series) I was transitioning from YA, and I wasn\u2019t very into PNR. It was my first adult werewolf romance, it was super hot, and the female characters were very different from the ones I read before. I was impressed, and she became an instant buy for me. That week I read every book of hers that was available at the time. I started to notice a pattern in her stories, there was a formula to them, particularly for the books in this series:1. Sassy uber confident heroine.2. Broody hero (this sometimes varies) with some sort of emotional trauma/hang-up.3. True mates that can\u2019t sense that they are true mates.4. Greta hating on the heroine (except Ronnie).5. The heroine hating on Greta and mocking her.6. Emotionally unavailable heroine.7. Dominic being funny but with no book in a foreseeable future.Now I\u2019m starting to get irritated. There\u2019s nothing wrong with an author to have certain elements that let you know the story is soooo them, but it\u2019s like she\u2019s stuck in her comfort zone, and she just won\u2019t take a step out of it.I\u2019m also mad at her for playing dirty by leaving Dominic\u2019s book for last so we don\u2019t loose interest in the series. Lest get real, if she ruins that one there\u2019ll be lots of angry fans, and angry fans can be vengeful -at leas I can be.If I\u2019m so mad, then why did I rate the book so high? Well, I never said I was perfect. I acknowledge that I\u2019m part of the problem, I\u2019m in too deep, there\u2019s no saving me.I\u2019m emotionally invested in this story.There\u2019s just no going back for me.Anyway...The story was good, the writing amazing as always, and the characters deviated a bit from SW\u2019s standard, which was a nice surprise.I would just love to see a different kind of heroine, the most she\u2019s deviated from her female lead of choice was with Ronnie (and she\u2019s been one of her best), I\u2019d like to see a more vulnerable heroine that needs to work hard to be brave. At this point I\u2019m just praying she doesn\u2019t ruin Dom\u2019s story.***********Some women just want to watch the world burn \ud83d\udd25\ud83d\udd25\ud83d\udd25If I don\u2019t get Dominic this year someone\u2019s gonna get hurt \ud83d\udd2aI\u2019ve been waiting for Dominic since 2014, when I first read Feral Sins.Now that that\u2019s done...

It was always the generic taunts and insult that was ALWAYS the same. I don't know how the women of this series do it but they always have a similar one liner when she speaks, it's like they all share one brain or something. Anyway, Yay to less snarky Greta...and another thingAt this point all the remaining male characters should just stop mating because their mating seem to be a trouble magnet. There's ALWAYS something happening when they find their mate. You'd think they'd see it as a sign to stay single.maybe it's just meNow onto the actual reviewFrankie was a witness to the death of her parents when she was three years old, it was so traumatic that she repressed the memories. She was removed from the pack by her human maternal grandparents and brought up as a lone wolf. When she gets a message from her paternal aunt about her ailing grandmother she is surprised to discover she has other family and she confronts her parents. She meets her aunt and meets Trick. Trick immediately recognizes her as his true mate but he is prepared to wait until she is emotionally ready before springing it up on her. She is reintroduced to the pack and seems to fit it well.****So I did not get why everyone she was reintroduced to asked if she remembered them. They kept giving details like it was going to make a difference. Why would she remember eating bugs and if she was tormenting boys and who her best friend was. She was three!!! You would think she was a teenager when she was taken away. I barely remember the people I met two years ago talk less of remembering them after 23 years.****The entire mystery of who killed Frankie's father , I guessed immediately. I'm like duh give me something harder, dammit.Honestly, if you have read one book by SW , you've probably read them all, they are beyond predictable. A mate bond that takes a while to form, some other woman/other man drama, some almost mated with a psychotic ex/person drama, the sabotage drama, the almost dying drama, the never ending wetness of the h's, the cinnamon/rose/coffee/earth/dark smell of the characters, the husky cigarette smoke voice of the character, really it's all the same.

I really liked Frankie, she was funny and at times sweet, and she never jumped to conclusions, she thought stuff through and remained calm. I especially loved her dislike of proverbs, that was hilarious. I fell in love with Trick pretty quickly and he just kept getting better and better.

This time we get a female half wolf who discovers that all she thought about her life was frankly a lie. Frankie was brought up by her grandparents after her shifter father killed her human mother and then shot himself . No one understands exactly why but there\u2019s a lot that Frankie doesn\u2019t know about so when someone claiming to be her fathers sister gets in touch it opens up a can of worms . Frankie needs answers and luckily wolf shifter Trick seems happy to help but why does Frankie's wolf like having him around so much ?I thoroughly enjoyed being back with the Phoenix Pack as for me that\u2019s where my journey with this author started. Seeing favourite characters just added to my enjoyment but I do wish a certain grandmother would lighten up as the jokes at her expense somehow don\u2019t feel as fresh or funny anymore. That niggle aside it was fun reading about dominant Trick do his best to woo and generally slip under Frankie's guard. Don\u2019t misunderstand though as Frankie is never lied to by Trck and is fully onboard as they explore their mutual attraction. It\u2019s hard for him though as Trick feels he has been cheated out of years with his Mate that he can never get back.There is obviously more to the story than just the romance and I thought the suspense was handled very well. If brutal I actually wanted a little more about those seeking to invade Phoenix territory but I\u2019m sure there\u2019s still lots more to come. Bottom line is Trick is sweet and yet dominant and knows exactly what he needs. Frankie is definitely not a push over and has her own quirks that I found very funny. If you enjoy sexy shifter stories then this author should definitely be on your bookshelf.This voluntary take is of a copy I requested from Netgalley and my thoughts and comments are honest and I believe fair"}, {"userName": "Mindy Lou's Book Review", "userReviewDate": "Apr 29, 2018", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/44132489-mindy-lou-s-book-review", "userReview": "I feel like this series is just getting better and better. In the beginning, we had main couples who fought the idea of being true mates and the last few have had more acceptance. In Wild Hunger, there was no pushing away and I loved it! This couple was such a treat to read about. I get such a kick out of couples working together instead of against each other. To me, that kept the focus on the true angst of the story which is Frankie's past and the new threat to the Phoenix pack. I'm really enjoying this series and seeing past couples together. If you enjoy dominant men that have possessive and protective streaks, this series for you. You can read these books as standalones but I do think you will enjoy them more if you start at the beginning and learn everyone's story. It sounds like Bracken may be next but we still have Dominic without a mate as well. I don't think I will ever get tired of this series so I hope the author keeps them coming!

Honestly, she will probably always be my absolute favorite shifter/paranormal romance writer out there. Even though her books are kind of predictable, especially if you've read nearly all of her books, I still enjoy them and will pick up the next one without fail because her writing is just so addictive!This book focuses on Trick and Frankie and in a nice turn of events, they accept their mating bond quite easily. Usually in these books, they have the push and pull but Trick has always wanted to find his mate and Frankie is pretty drama free and doesn't act crazy just for crazy sake. Overall, I'd say it was a nice change and I liked how we could see them just be a happy couple together. There was also the usual action/suspense at the end but this book was different in that there was a bit of a mystery subplot throughout the book about Frankie's past and her parents. It was a nice touch and it kept me on my toes throughout the book. My one complaint about this book was the way the author used Trick's bisexuality to cause drama for the couple and just drama in general. I was happy with the way Trick talked about his sexuality and explained to Frankie about how just because he's been with both men and women, it doesn't mean that she can't give him everything or that he would be missing out. I thought it was very well done (especially with the ridiculous notion/stereotype people seem to have that bisexual people can't be monogamous or need to be with both men and women always) and after the first conversation, I was satisfied and I felt like Frankie was too. After all, they are true mates; what does it matter who he's been with in the past? She is his soulmate just like she is his and her ex's don't matter. But for some reason there was this whole sub-plot of Frankie having these continuous interactions with his ex's, in particular the men he's hooked up with and I just found the whole thing unnecessary and kind of left a bad taste in my mouth. The way gay men were portrayed and the way there was this continuous \"you are not enough for him because you aren't a man\" drama, really bothered me because I don't quite know what the author was trying to achieve by doing all this? It felt like she wanted to keep reminding us that he'd been with men even though it was already fine and dealt with earlier in the book. Honestly the whole thing felt unnecessary and drawn out. Overall I would say this is another great addition to the series. It's not my favorite but it was still an enjoyable read and I am eagerly anticipating the next (and last) book in this series."}, {"userName": "Jen", "userReviewDate": "May 13, 2018", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/41168199-jen", "userReview": "I adore Suzanne Wright. I will read anything she writes, (so take this review with a grain of salt!) This book follows the typical \"Wright shifter format,\" but refreshingly, the female lead doesn't incite extra angst drama. Our female lead was actually anti angst, but in my opinion, perhaps overly so. Our female lead was supposedly dominant, but I missed that aspect of her character in the book. Perhaps Wright can find that balance between the two next time.

This does not affect my opinion of the book or the content of my review.Ever since I grabbed up \"Feral Sins\" many years ago, I fell in love with this series and this author. There is so much fun snarky humor and sexy times and great plots in each of the books that I can never resist grabbing them up. And I was so thrilled to see that I had the chance to read \"Wild Hunger\" and I have been waiting for Trick's book for quite some time now and I am so glad that Wright has finally written this long anticipated story and it was well worth the wait.What I admire most about this series are the characters....they are so passionate and strong willed and determined to make a good life for themselves. Even characters that are more submissive in nature, have their own courage and strengths that are admirable. In Wild Hunger, we have a story of bringing in a lost member back into the fold. Frankie was a young child when she lost her parents when her father killed her mother and then killed himself. She has no memory of the event or those that were her friends and family. She has lived with her maternal grandparents ever since and they have kept her isolated from the pack ever since. But when a fellow pack mate from the Phoenix Pack...Lydia reaches out to her, she wants to know more about her past and the family she has never known. She reconnects with old members including a sexy male...Trick, who always has her back and one she has a unique connection to.I found myself simply in love with this story and the unfolding mystery behind the deaths of Frankie's parents. And wow this author blew me away with this ending, not what I was expecting at all but I do love that about Wright is when I think I have everything in the story figured out she tosses me another wrinkle that is so unexpected and keeps me on my toes. And I found the romance in this story to be so REFRESHING. The hero especially,\u00a0 once he meets Frankie, he knows that she is his mate and more than ready to claim her but he does take it slowly with her. This story had me laughing so hard and I love the humor that Wright places in her stories, they just always seem to work for me.An engaging, intense filled plot that will keep you guessing and will have you on the edge of your seat in ways you don't expect....PROVOKING!![foogallery id=\"55810\"]"}, {"userName": "Danielle (Danniegurl)", "userReviewDate": "May 05, 2018", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/10879719-danielle-danniegurl", "userReview": "[murderer was.

The mix of humour, wonderfully written sarcastic snark, romance, steam and the fantastically developed paranormal world all combine to create a fun and exciting series. Though I admit that the last few books felt a bit repetitive, this one shakes up the formula a bit, and I absolutely loved it! Trick is one of the enforcers of the Phoenix Pack. As one of the original crew who formed the pack, he has incredibly close ties with his packmates, and though he is happy that they are all settling down, he is feeling lonely for his own mate. It\u2019s something he has always wanted, and he has avoided relationships knowing that his true mate was out there waiting for him, but his need for her is becoming more intense.\nA deep loneliness had steadily crept up on Trick and his wolf as they\u2019d watched their pack mates and allies find their true mates, one by one. Of the adult male wolves within his pack, only he and Dominic remained unmated. There was now a bitter edge to his wolf\u2019s loneliness.\nFrankie is a wolf shifter who lives in the human world. Following the tragic and disturbing deaths of her parents, she was taken from her pack to live with her human grandparents when she was only three years old. Since that time she has had no contact with her pack, and has been kept away from the shifter life since that time, believing that her pack wanted nothing to do with her. So she is shocked when her shifter Aunt Lydia (a member of the Phoenix Pack) reaches out to her. She agrees to meet, learns the truth, and finds herself becoming drawn back into her family and into the pack life that she has missed out on her entire life. And, of course, it brings her into contact with Trick.\nHer Persian-blue gaze met Trick\u2019s, and his surroundings just seemed to fade away until there was only her. Something inside him roared to life, and a strange possessiveness began to viciously claw at his gut and tighten his chest. It was as primal and basic as the need that twisted his stomach. His cock twitched, thickened, hardened \u2013 until he was full and aching like a bitch. The word \u201cmine\u201d pounded around his skull over and over. And that could only mean one thing.There you are, Trick thought with an inner smile.\nTrick knew Frankie when she was a child, and with one spine-tingling glance at her as an adult, he knows that she is his. He is thrilled that his search is over, and though he is instantly protective and possessive, he takes things slow with her, knowing that she has a lot to catch up with, and OMG he is absolute perfection! And when Frankie begins to feel the truth of their bond, the relationship that begins is just gorgeous.\n\u201cIt eats me up inside that I missed so much of your life. Eats me up that I didn\u2019t realize who you were to me when we were kids. I\u2019ve been waiting to find you \u2013 or, as it seems, to get you back \u2013 for so fucking long\u2026I\u2019m not going to give you up.\u201d\nI freaking LOVED this romance! First and foremost, I love how matter of fact they are about the whole thing! They both feel the bond, they accept that it\u2019s there, and they don\u2019t run from it. They embrace it, openly exploring it, and honestly sharing all that they are feeling for each other. It was so refreshing to read such a functional romance, and I loved watching them both relish everything happening between them. \nShe straightened in her chair and twisted to face him. \u201cGet ready.\u201dTrick blinked. \u201cFor what?\u201d\u201cIt should hit us any minute now.\u201d\u201cWhat do you--\u201d Red-hot arousal slammed into him and flooded his system. Just like that, his blood thickened, his body tightened, and his cock filled to bursting. And then the drive to soothe her disappeared, completely drowned out by the urge to take and claim and mate. He double-blinked. \u201cFuck.\u201dShe swallowed, her mouth suddenly bone-dry. \u201cYeah, we need to fuck.\u201d\nAs always, the romance is super steamy. Shifters are passionate and carnal creatures and there\u2019s a whole lot of sexy time going on. But it\u2019s reflective of their relationship and the intensity of everything that is happening between them. And it\u2019s balanced really well with the emotional side of things as Trick supports Frankie through the changes in her life, and coming to terms with the secrets of her past. \n\u201cYou\u2019re not only enough for me. You\u2019re everything.\u201d\nAnd more than just the romance, there\u2019s also a mystery aspect to the story that brings some action, suspense and excitement. The Phoenix Pack are involved in a dispute with a rival pack that puts them in danger, and then there\u2019s the drama surrounding Frankie\u2019s parents\u2019 deaths and the disturbing nightmares that haunt her. I loved watching it all play out, and I loved how Trick and Frankie stand together through it all \u2013 having each other\u2019s backs unquestionably and holding nothing back as they literally fight to claim the happy ending they both want.I loved this book. It was lots of fun, with laugh-out-loud moments, action and excitement, and a fantastic romance that is both sexy and emotional. I loved Trick and Frankie as characters, and loved seeing them both together, and as part of the larger pack. And though it\u2019s honestly getting a little hard to keep all of the other characters straight in my head, I did enjoy catching up with them and watching them embrace Frankie as one of their own (and drunken karaoke night sounds like a blast!).This was a fantastic read. 4.5 stars.An Advanced Review Copy was generously provided by the author via NetGalley in exchange for an honest review."}, {"userName": "Kodie Mackay", "userReviewDate": "Apr 29, 2018", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/28772576-kodie-mackay", "userReview": "Me - looses my shit when I see that Wild Hunger is up in Netgalley.Me - presses that request button whilst praying to those romance gods that I get accepted.

So you better believe I dug right in driving nose first into the crazy not taking a break until this rollercoaster was over. I AM LIVING BREATHING DYING FOR THIS BOOK. I love this series and have been a die hard fan from the minute she released Feral Sins!. I never doubted her ability to write a great book but this is number 7 in the series and after a while things can get repetitive. This was NOT the case here! She brought new, exciting and equally heartbreaking. It was a fucking journey for sure. A sculptor of beautiful horrors Frankie just nailed it on the badass train. I love her character, she had substance. She wasn't rash, she didn't over react and whilst she wasn't a fan of people in general she took them as they came without judgment even in the shittest of circumstances. I got a great vibe off her from the start. Trick was a surprise. See we don't get a lot from him and whilst we know he has had past relations with others in the pack, a lot of him is one bit question mark. That man is all kinds of sinful. He takes what he wants without remorse and he protects what's his. He's loyal, smart and cunning. A realist, he was ready for his mate so when she appeared he knew instantly and with no reservations. I loved that about him. There is no back and forth in the story. You know from the start that these two characters will be together and that gives a different perspective on this book. Instead of that when will these realise moment you get to see them grow and learn. Navigate their path through the story finding what works for them. The chemistry is instantaneous and palpable through the pages. It's easy to connect to them as characters because they feel real and are so easy to love. You relate to their struggle and route for their happy. They made sense in everyway. Trick & Frankie's book doesn't disappoint. With every book we get the humour, an abundance of sarcasm and a slew of crazy dysfunctional side characters always keeping things interesting. This time the suspense is almost too much. A finely woven story seemlessly written with the emotional capacity to hit from every direction making me feel it all. It's sweet and fire, heartbreaking and painful. A imperfectly perfect story almost bittersweet yet so fitting to them. I loved it all. It's a rollercoaster but the ride it worth the outcome.

The icing on this expialidocious cake is that her super sexy heroes are dirty talkers to their bones and can back it up. Her books are my paranormal nirvana and Wild Hunger did not disappoint.

She was just\u2026Frankie. Quirky doesn\u2019t begin to cover it, especially when you factor in her weird, creepy sculptures.
