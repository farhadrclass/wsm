She lives a relatively content and peaceful life until after her husband dies in a plane crash. In Signs of the Blood, she becomes an amateur detective who investigates the death of her friend\u2019s son, a \u201csimple\u201d man by the name of Cletus. Cletus is found dead in a river, though he had a strong fear of water. The Sheriff writes it off as an accidental drowning, but his mother, Birdie, isn\u2019t satisfied, and asks Elizabeth for help.Elizabeth\u2019s investigation leads her to discover the underbelly of secluded mountain communities. There\u2019s crazy right-wing militias, a cult compound, a snake-handling church, and more. While it may seem a bit much in this description, Lane makes it work. The situation doesn\u2019t seem absurd and over-crazified. At first, I wasn\u2019t sure about the pace of the book, but it really picks up and becomes really interesting really fast. The descriptions are gorgeous, and being a southern-Appalachian girl myself, it invoked thoughts of home. It\u2019s probably not a book for everyone, but people who like mysteries or Appalachian Lit should definitely check it out."}, {"userName": "LeeAnne", "userReviewDate": "Jun 25, 2009", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/870163-leeanne", "userReview": "I picked up this book because I Appalachian folklore. This mystery contains a story within a story and bounces back and forth between the early 20th century and today. I found the story of Little Sylvie to be the most compelling part of the book and it is what kept me plugging along. The \"current\" story was just sort of blah. In fact, there were two or three story lines that more or less got resolved in a fumbling sort of way.Having said all that, I think that Vicki Lane is a good writer and a good story teller. \"Signs in the Blood\" reads like a first novel, one that contains enough for two or three novels but crams it all into one in case a second book doesn't happen. I definitely enjoyed this book enough to read the second one and I would recommend it to others with the caution that it tends to wander a bit."}, {"userName": "Sandra", "userReviewDate": "Apr 09, 2009", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/2140788-sandra", "userReview": "I expected this to be first-rate.

I discovered this author on a trip to Asheville NC, when her just-released latest book was prominently displayed in the windows of Asheville's wonderful independent bookstore, Malaprop's. That book was a sequel, so I sought out this one, the first in her series set in rural NC. Provides a nice snapshot of Appalachian life and culture, both contemporary and a century ago -- though hardly comprehensive. My parents came from southeastern Kentucky, a bit west of this novel's setting, and I felt many elements were presented authentically (at least they matched my experience). I especially loved the local dialect.All the background and local color is hung from a very conventional murder-mystery framework, which is quite ordinary, even forgettable. But I'd still recommend the book in a heartbeat.What some others have said:\"Fundamentalist Christian snake handlers and liberal back-to-the-landers; a secretive white supremacist militia and undercover police agents; simple rural mountain dwellers and sophisticated urban artists\u2014throw in a counterculture commune of allegedly extraterrestrial origin and that still wouldn\u2019t cover all the disparate types who populate the Appalachian community of Ridley Branch, N.C., the setting for this well-crafted, dramatic tale of murder, miracles and midlife romance.\u00a0 . .\u00a0\u00a0Also admirable is the sensitivity with which Lane utilizes exotic religions to intensify the book\u2019s dark-toned suspense, while resisting oversimplification and insult. Her heroine\u2019s open-minded fascination with beliefs not her own should appeal to an unusually wide readership.\u00a0\"\u00a0\u00a0-- Publishers Weekly Advance Forecasts (June 11, 2005)\u00a0\u201cVicki Lane shows us an exotic and colorful picture of Appalachia from an outsider\u2019s perspective \u2013 through a glass darkly.\u00a0 It is a well-crafted suspenseful tale of the bygone era before \u2018Florida\u2019 came to the mountains.\u201d-- Sharyn McCrumb, New York Times Best-Selling author of St. Dale\u00a0\u201cOne can\u2019t live in the Appalachians without hearing the stories that rise from them.\u00a0 Vicki Lane is one of those rare storytellers who transports the mysteries and tales and characters of her beloved mountains into the greater world with dignity and sympathy and intelligence.\u00a0 The mystery that intrigues me most right now is what she will do next.\u201d-- Tony Earley, Author of Jim the Boy\u00a0\u201cIn Signs in the Blood, Vicki Lane captured my ear on the first page.\u00a0 Her dialect is right on the money.\u00a0 Her characters live and breathe and hold their secrets close \u2013 heart wrenching secrets that pulled me in and kept me reading.\u00a0 Her imagery is so real you can touch it, smell it, feel it.\u00a0 Now, add to all this a beautifully told tale with a great unexpected twist and you\u2019ve got one of the best mystery books I\u2019ve read in a long time.\u00a0 I\u2019ll be looking for more from Ms. Lane.\u201d-- Sheila Kay Adams, Author of My Old True Love\u00a0\u201cCurled up in a rocking chair next to the wood heater on a cold, damp winter day, Signs in the Blood warmed me and kept me engaged to the last page.\u00a0 The characters were familiar; the landscape was close at hand.\u00a0 Ms. Lane\u2019s understanding of mountain language, history, and culture, combined with a wonderful ability to tell a story, made for an absolutely great read.\u201d-- Rob Amberg, Author and photographer of Sodom Laurel Album"}, {"userName": "Nikki", "userReviewDate": "Mar 28, 2008", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/736266-nikki", "userReview": "Recent discussions on the DorothyL list caused me to order this book before I started my State Mystery Project. It takes place in North Carolina and I couldn't wait that long to read it; plus, having already read books by Sharyn McCrumb and Phillip DePoy, I'm familiar enough (vicariously) with the western NC mountains that, when I get to the state in my project, I'll be looking for something different, maybe coastal or the Research Triangle. Nevertheless, I hope Vicki Lane writes many more books about Elizabeth Goodweather and the area in which she lives.SIGNS IN THE BLOOD has some structural similarities to Sharyn McCrumb's GHOST RIDERS, which I read a short time back. Both alternate a modern story with a tale from the mountain past, told in the first person. I think Ms. Lane's is by far the better book. For one thing, the present-day story in SIGNS IN THE BLOOD is a true mystery and not ashamed to be one, whereas that in Ms. McCrumb's book rambles from character to character and never seems to go anywhere either as a mystery or a novel. The story from the past in Ms. Lane's book also brings to mind the tales in Deborah Grabien's Haunted Ballad series, in that we first hear a garbled version (or versions) of the story and, bit by bit, learn the truth.I don't mean by these comparisons to suggest that Ms. Lane's book is other than original -- quite the contrary. She has written an excellent book -- setting, characters and plot are all first-rate.Ms. Lane's protagonist, Elizabeth Goodweather, is a complicated character and a person I'd love to know in real life. As a relative newcomer to the mountains, she has made friends with the local people and learned much from them while maintaining her own sense of who she is. When her friend Birdie's \"slow\" son Cletus disappears while out hunting ginseng, Elizabeth tries to help find him. When Cletus's body is found in a river, and Birdie can't believe his death was an accident as the Sheriff believes, Elizabeth begins to investigate in earnest. Her investigation leads her to some interesting and rather scary places -- to services at a snake-handling church where she encounters a prophetess with messages for her, to a \"New Age\" community with a sinister feel, to a group of right-wing militiamen and to a revival preacher who's also an \"Outsider artist.\"It's been five years since Elizabeth's husband was killed in the crash of a private plane. Only now has she really begun to allow herself to grieve for him, and perhaps because of that, she is also allowing herself to be a bit interested in men again. One of them is the preacher at the snake-handling church, to whom she is strangely attracted in spite of their having almost nothing in common; the other is an old friend of her husband's, a policeman, who shows up in nearby Asheville and wants to renew their acquaintance. When Elizabeth is the recipient of various threatening gestures, suspicion falls on both men. Indeed, there is plenty of suspicion to go around and red herrings abound. The thrilling denouement kept me up well past my bedtime.SIGNS IN THE BLOOD is a bit longer than most mystery novels, but there was not a page I would willingly have had left out. I'm rating it five stars/excellent and highly recommend it."}, {"userName": "Joan", "userReviewDate": "Nov 26, 2008", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/172839-joan", "userReview": "I discovered Vicki Lane at Malaprops in Asheville - Great discovery.

The puzzling death of a neighbor's son shatters that peace and sends her on a life-changing quest in search of a missing shotgun.Traveling the winding roads into the hidden coves and hollows of the Appalachians, Elizabeth finds the laurel thickets and rocky hillsides are full of surprises --- serpent handlers, star children, tongues-talkers, sang hunters, militia men --- and murder."}, {"userName": "Angie Lisle", "userReviewDate": "Feb 06, 2013", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/5306709-angie-lisle", "userReview": "A 3-star start with a 5-star ending. Appalachian literature, a story within a story: modern-day Elizabeth is helping a neighbor try to figure out what happened to her son, while the memory of Sylvie, who once lived where Elizabeth lives, still clings to the landscape and the people who remember her. This technique helps convey the evolution of Appalachia from then to now. At first glance, the meandering descriptions and plot could appear to be the mistake of an amateur writer, which Ms. Lane was at the time of publication. The book starts slowly, with an overload of information that winds up being an illusionist's trick to redirect attention. As the story progresses, the writing style begins to multi-task (and, honestly, I'm impressed by the delivery). The story-telling mimics the shape of Appalachia, wandering about much like our creeks and roads, slowing one down to a pace more suited for this neck of the woods. The language and sentence structure is reminiscent of the mountain ballads - the old, dark ballads that ain't afraid to show some spilled blood. That's a clue about the whammy of an ending for little Sylvie's story but one I completely ignored because the modern-murders themselves are covered in the way that reminded me of a cozy mystery - brief and at a distance, no one has to clean up the blood. So when we find out what Mr. Tomlin did to poor little Sylvie...it's a hard punch in the guts to see the matter laid out in plain sight and, when paralleled with the criminal activities that Elizabeth sees unfold, hints at a fear that is still present and active in the world today (and may be happening to some of the unmentioned victims of the story's modern crime, if one thinks about what could happen next, after this particular crime is committed - which sends shivers down the spine). I don't want to give spoilers but I will say this - people who are sensitive to fictional violence should avoid this particular book; however, I highly recommend this book to folks who love the old ballads and the bloody folktales attached to them. I look forward to reading the next book in this series."}, {"userName": "Gail", "userReviewDate": "Mar 12, 2011", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/821301-gail", "userReview": "Elizabeth Goodweather lives a lovely and simple life in the hills and hollows of North Carolina, across the mountain from Tennessee. Even though she's lived there more than 20 years, raised her daughters there, and made warm friends, she's still a newcomer in many ways. After her husband died eight years ago, she threw herself in keeping their herb farm and business going and getting her daughters into their own lives. Now the daughters are living away and the farm is being managed by a nephew and Elizabeth has more leisure time...and more time to miss her husband.As she struggles with grief, anger, and aloneness, her friend Miss Birdie asks Elizabeth for her help. Miss Birdie's son Cletus is found dead and Miss Birdie is certain it is not an accident. Her son was a simple soul, wandering the hollers all year pursuing wild ginseng and touching the lives of the people in the hollers of NC and TN. Elizabeth helps her and finds herself in the worlds of evangelical preachers, new age communities, militias, \"squalor hollers,\" and holiness churches. Strange and compelling attractions and distractions come her way as she uncovers danger and the truth.Intertwining the present day story is the story of Little Sylvie who lived in a small cabin on Elizabeth's land. Unknown and misunderstood in the present day, Little Sylvie's story emerges with a new truth as wellWonderful storytelling, great command of the vernacular, and a terrific feel for the attraction of life philosophies not your own.

The differences between her and most of her neighbors are clearly set out in the first chapter as she waits, somewhat uncomfortably, to see her dying friend Dessie. The preacher is praying with the gathered family and friends, and Lane captures the delivery of a Southern evangelical, holiness-type prayer very well. Dessie's last words to Elizabeth tell her that trouble is coming and that Elizabeth has a role to play in setting things right.There are two mysteries in this book, one contemporary and one over a hundred years old. Elizabeth is trying to help an old friend determine if her son died in an accident or was murdered. The hunt leads her up and down the hollers, where she finds out that some of her new neighbors are not folks you want living next door. There are communes and compounds, and some people with guns and anger issues.The older mystery is what happened to Little Sylvie Tomlin - why did she run off with another man, leaving her child behind?Thoroughly enjoyed this book.

She's a 'newcomer' to the area since she and her husband settled there only 20 years before. When the book opens, Elizabeth is nearly paralyzed in the grip of depression that began when her husband died five years before. And then a neighbor's son, rather 'simple' but with a strong knowledge of the mountains, turns up dead after one of his normal walkabout/hunting trips, and his mother does not believe it was an accident, and asks Elizabeth's help to trace his path.In an interesting but busy set-up, we learn of four religious groups established in the area, any of whom have secrets that may have led to the young man's death: a Stargazer cult, a white supremacist militia group, a snake-handling bible group, and a revivalist tent minister/painter with his followers.The book is excellent: good\u00a0solid writing, a beautiful portrait of\u00a0Appalachia and its people,\u00a0drawn without cariacature or condescention,\u00a0wonderful characters you want to read more about.

This story has it all -- snake handlers, charismatic preachers, prophecy, a religious cult, right-ring militia men, lost dogs, terminal illness, a spark of romance, and much more. Oh, and I almost forgot murder. The dialect is dead-on, and the author paints a moving portrait of the mountain people of this region. (She lives there herself.) And, although Elizabeth is an intellectual and an agnostic, she is both open-minded and respectful of her neighbors' devout religious beliefs. Interestingly, she is actually envious of those beliefs. There is a hundred year old subplot running in the background of this story that is fascinating as well.

(Oh, and I did send her back out to search for the non-fiction series I was looking for...)"}, {"userName": "Stephen", "userReviewDate": "Oct 07, 2008", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/1597306-stephen", "userReview": "This author lives in North Carolina, somewhere northwest of Asheville. She has a keen ear for the language of the hills, and treats the culture with respect. This is a mystery. Protagonist is a 50-something widow. All the women are strong. With two exceptions, the men are mostly foolish, nasty or just take up space. She has another in the \"Blood\" series which I haven't read."}], "description": "Elizabeth Goodweather and her husband built a rewarding life in the hills and hollows of their adopted Appalachian home.
