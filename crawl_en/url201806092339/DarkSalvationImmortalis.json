However, it totally rocked my socks off. I love, love, love getting into Nicholas\u2019 head, especially since he was one of my favorite characters from the Immortalis series. I couldn\u2019t believe there\u2019d be a novella with him in it!! I jumped on the chance to read this of course, and I wasn\u2019t disappointed.Nicholas has been brooding ever since the death of his mate Rozaline. The pain and anguish he suffers daily causes definite rifts in his vampire clan, who are currently residing in Boston. One night out with his leader, Lisander, brings him face to face with someone who shifts his world in a way he never expected. Kitara is searching for her lost fianc\u00e9, and she\u2019s going to need Nicholas more than she, and he, knowsI enjoyed the playful banter between these two characters. I wasn\u2019t sure, at first, if fireworks would happen for them, but love at first sight isn\u2019t my thing for the most part. So, I was pleasantly surprised to see the relationship grow so naturally between these two supernaturals in their quest to find and defeat their mortal enemies, the Acta Sanctorum, a cult who specializes in eliminating anyone deemed \u2018unnatural\u2019 and who would like nothing but to destroy them both and everyone they love.This is a spin off the Immortalis series and I hope to see more spin offs for I enjoy every minute with these colorful, intriguing and supernatural characters who weave their way into your head and never let go. Amazing storytelling and it includes some racy scenes to boil your blood and heat up the pages. Definitely a perfect addition to a great vampire series."}, {"userName": "Shan", "userReviewDate": "Dec 15, 2016", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/5907240-shan", "userReview": "I liked getting Nicholas story, and understanding him a bit better. Nicholas' mate was killed in one of the previous books, and he is still really hurting because of it, and Lysander wants to help Nicholas get past it and move on, so they go out for a night on the town. I just want to say that it has only been around 3 months or so since she was killed, so right off the bat, I'm thinking why are these people bothering him to get over it, so I wasn't happy with those turn of events, and it made Nicholas' relationship with his mate seem insignificant, so when Nicholas meets Kitara it's all a bit bittersweet for me. Kitara's boyfriend has joined the Saints, and has dumped Kitara, but she thinks he has been brainwashed, so she has come to Boston to find him and convince him to return home with her, which came across as very desperate to me, and some of the actions later in the book don't lead me to believe her feelings are deep enough for her to be so blind and devoted when it comes to her boyfriend. She ends up getting into some dangerous situations, and Nicholas ends up saving her. Kitara has a vague idea that there are other types of beings out there, but she is still pretty clueless; that's something I don't really like about this series, all of the females are sort of na\u00efve and whiny, and make things worse a lot of the time, so I would have liked for there to be a strong female character that was capable and confident all on their own. Nicholas decides Kitara needs protecting, so he ends up letting her in on the knowledge about vampires, the Saints, and the rest of the supernatural world, but there is something about Kitara that isn't quite normal. Once I got past Kitara's desire to get her boyfriend back, I did like her and she does have some feisty to her that I enjoyed, and she handles things fairly well, and there is some chemistry between Nicholas and her. The sex scene is hot; except for Nicholas thinking he is out of practice even though it has only been 3 months! There's also some good action in this book, and it's well written; kept me entertained till the end. All in all, this is a good addition to the series, and if you liked the rest of the series, you should definitely read this book!"}, {"userName": "Donna", "userReviewDate": "Feb 22, 2017", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/43244109-donna", "userReview": "*I voluntarily read an ARC of this book*I loved Nicholas & Rozaline together but he just seemed so lost without her.

Dark, brooding, and very snarky, Nicholas has been going through life with no purpose but to fight the Saints since losing his chosen mate. Kitara, a witch looking for her lost lover, keeps flirting with death only for Nicholas to become her black knight, saving her life over and over. Fighting the bad guys, mistrust, and lost love, Nicholas and Kit spat and stumble their way to their HEA. Alyssa and Lysander, the main characters from the series, only have minor parts in this book.

And some of the characters from that series play a big part in this book.This is Nicolas story and how he is coping with losing his mate and opening up to the potential of loving again. And I loved it Katie brings you back into the world of Vampires and The saint's and it really feels like you haven\u2019t left it, it feels like coming home to family.It was so so good to be back in the world of the Peregrinus Clan and catching up with some of them.I love lysander (swoon) and Alyssa so it was so good to get a glimpse of them and to see they still haven't changed and I certainly loved one scene between them *cough cough* a naked Lysander. :)Oh Nicholas you are one hard nut to crack but under all that hard exterior you are sure one hell of a softy.Even though this story is about Nicolas and Kitara i loved the interaction with some of the side characters especially Ian and Nicolas i found myself laughing at these two the witty banter between them is Hilarious. Hint Hint Katie i would love for Ian to find his HEA he is just so cute don't tell him i said that he would love it too much.The story is basically about Kitara trying to find out why her Boyfriend left her suddenly and joined The Saints. She knows she is different but hasn't used her powers for much so when Nicolas interferes With her chat to another man she isn't happy but she does notice Nicolas is different to.With Kitara doing anything to find out where Jeremy is she puts herself in danger a few times and with the Clan knowing The Saints are back on the scene Nicolas can't help but save her.My favourite quote from this book..\"The reality, the harsh lesson of it all, was the love was no more than a fucking Fairytale; complete bullshit. Fleeting and fickle, a childish fantasy of false hope. There were no happy-ever-afters in the real world. Only lying, cheating and broken hearts.\"And my oh my does Kitara learn this quote the hard way after spending one night with Nicolas and yes thanks Katie for that sex scene, can you say Hot..She throws herself into danger yet again and the worst betrayal ever comes from her ex Jeremy and she truly gets to see what evil The Saints are capable off.Will Nicolas be able to save her from the hands of someone who loved her for 5 years? Will Nicolas ever love again? Read the book to find the answers to these questions you will not be disappointed i highly recommend this book."}, {"userName": "Lissette", "userReviewDate": "May 21, 2013", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/4008232-lissette", "userReview": "Still smarting from the loss of his beloved, Rozaline, Nicholas wonders if he\u2019ll be able to overcome the loneliness and heartache he now feels deep within him. Harboring a profound hatred for the Acta Sanctorum, he vows to take his revenge on them in every way possible. In his mind, they must pay for taking away the one thing that meant the most to him. Getting close enough to complete that objective, unfortunately, is far from possible.With no other option but to wait on Lysander\u2019s orders to move against the Acta Sanctorum, Nicholas resolves himself to spending his days training for the moment when he can obliterate the order, once and for all. Preferring to keep to himself, he soon wonders as to whether he\u2019ll be able to exact his plans. He\u2019s a warrior, trained to fight, always at the ready for battle. He\u2019s not satisfied with the fact that he\u2019s to remain on standby when it comes to the order itself.When he stumbles upon the lovely Kitara Vanders one night, Nicholas soon realizes that she draws him to her in more ways than one. There\u2019s something about her that piques his interest, something he can\u2019t quite put his finger on. When it becomes apparent that she\u2019s been targeted for death, he vows to do everything possible to make sure Kitara comes to no harm. Even if it means that he must act as her knight-in-shining armor in order to ensure that she remains safe from those who seek to exact their retribution upon her.While Kitara isn\u2019t quite happy that he\u2019s come to her rescue on more than one occasion, she resolves herself to the fact that Nicholas isn\u2019t going to away. He promised her that she\u2019d be there if she ever needs him, a promise he intends to fulfill at every turn. She\u2019s the needed link in his taking down the Acta Sanctorum, and he\u2019ll make sure to tie up all loose ends somehow. Unfortunately, there\u2019s something he didn\u2019t count on \u2013 his attraction to the beautiful Kitara.Another wonderful addition to the Immortalis series, Dark Salvation gives us a glimpse into the world surrounding Nicholas himself. He\u2019s a dark, brooding warrior, mourning for his beloved mate. Katie has injected such feeling into his portion of the story, giving his world a much needed silver lining with the appearance of Kitara Vanders. She tests him in every way, inciting his passion whenever they have a clashing of wills.

And in all honesty, I really liked this book. Dark Salvation is number six in the series, but at no point did I feel lost or like I was missing backstory. I think that is important when dealing with a high numbered series, because sometimes people just aren't able to start from book one.Nicholas is a vampire, a very old vampire. I mean like centuries old. And lately he's been a bit of a jerk. It's not that he doesn't have reason though. His mate, Rozaline, had died a few months prior. And he is just not moving on. He is training and pushing everyone around him to train more. Train for what? To kill the Saints. The Acta Sanctorum, the ones responsible for her death. Aside from that, he's a bit of a gruff guy, and some might even say a bit of a jerk. And then one night his old friend, Lysander, takes him out on the town, to try and regroup. And that's when he first meets her. Kitara.Kitara is a witch, but she will tell you she is just a pagan. And she has a lot of power, enough that she can withstand Nicholas' mind intrusion. Not even vampires can do that, so color him impressed. She's a sparky woman, she stands up for herself and she is tough. I like her. Kitara also has a habit of getting herself right into harm's path, but luckily for her, Nicholas is able to show up - multiple times - and save her. Enough that he keeps a tally. She is in Boston searching for her boyfriend who left her when he became tied up with the Saints. He considered her to be part of the supernatural things he now hated.And there was some humor. Snarky and fun humor, lots of banter between Nicholas and Kitara. I loved that. It really helped offset times when there was action, high tension, or dramatic scenes. It wasn't a \"love at first sight\" type of thing with them. The relationship between the two of them really wasn't even a sure thing. At least that's what it felt like to me. And I liked that too, not knowing. But when something happens and Kitara is missing, all bets are off. Nicholas is a man on a mission. And oh boy, do I love a man on a mission when it comes to the woman he has realized he cares for! So this book has a lot of aspects that I really love. It's got the fire and spark, along with sexual chemisty - and sexual heat. Sexy vampires and kickass women. I think its a definite must read!"}, {"userName": "Len", "userReviewDate": "May 27, 2013", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/11867654-len", "userReview": "Dark Salvation by Katie Salidas is the sixth book in the Immortalis Series. It is an awesome book that had my attention from the very beginning all the way to the end. The previous five books in the Immortalis Series have a different story about each of the characters in the series. Dark Salvation tells the story of Nicholas.Nicholas is a handsome 2000 year old vampire who lives in a house with other vampires and they are like family to him. He is heartbroken due to the recent lost of his mate, Rozaline and he is trying to cope with her loss. Will he be able to go on with his life with out her? Will he ever find love again?Kitara is a beautiful young woman who shows up in Boston looking for her ex boyfriend, Jeremy, who had left her to join a group of Hunters. This group does not like anything that is unnatural. Who is this mysterious group? Why did Jeremy leave her? Kitara is having a hard time accepting Jeremy leaving and wants to find him so she can convince him to leave the group of Hunters and go back home with her. Nicholas and Kitara do not know each other. One evening, they happen to meet each other for the very first time when Nicholas was in town with his Vampire friend, who is like a brother to him. Their meeting of each other did not start off well. At first, Kitara did not care for Nicholas much and his impression of her wasn\u2019t great either. He has a feeling that there is more to Kitara and that she has some kind of special ability. Nicholas finds out later on what Kitara\u2019s reason is of being there and she also tells him the group name of the Hunters. When Nicholas hears the name, he knows exactly who they are. This is the beginning of Nicholas and Kitara\u2019s journey. They find out a lot about each other during their time together. Nicholas shows Kitara what he is and it shocks her. It is hard for her to believe that there is more of his kind out there. Kitara was in trouble and Nicholas was there to save her so he took her back to his house to keep her safe. A few days later, Kitara disappears and Nicholas has a feeling that something bad has happened to her. Will he be able to find Kitara in time? Katie Salidas has done an amazing job writing Dark Salvation. I am really looking forward to going back and reading the first book in the series, Immortalis Carpe Noctem and the rest of the Immortalis Series.

This is a re-readable for me. I love those vampire romances! ********Love that it is freaking October and I forgot to update with the review here. Many apologies! First I should say that you do NOT need to read the first book or the previous books to jump into this novel and enjoy the hell out of it. The previous novels will set up/background some of the character relationships, notably Alyssa and Lysander, and some of Nicholas, but you do not necessarily HAVE to read them to enjoy this book. Should you? Uh...YES. We're talking about Katie Salidas' HOT vampires, great plots, and as you can see from the excerpt above, NO sparkles!Meet Kit. She's chasing her boyfriend who dumped her and joined a religious cult. Yeah, she's dumb. But she's also a witch with incredibly strong mental powers, able to shield and project. Meet Nicholas. Nicholas is a two thousand year old vampire who lost his mate, Rozaline, in the last year or so. Nicholas is heartbroken and it makes him extra grouchy. Kitara just can't accept that her boyfriend of five years/fiance of six months has turned into a douchebag and dumped her to join this cult. Turns out...this cult? Yeah, it's Acta Sanctorum, the Saints, dedicated to eradicating this world of anything they deem unnatural, including a pagan (Kit). Nicholas saves Kit's life three, four, five times and each time she seems to respond to him in a nasty, bitchy manner. We learn it's because she's determined to find Jeremy and convince him to come back to her. Some people just have to learn the hard way, I guess. But while she's learning, the sparks between her and Nicholas are bright!She has to learn the hard way that Nicholas is right about Jeremy- he's a lost cause. But that's okay because Nicholas and Kit have started something...something hot, something spectacular, and oooh baby in the end? Well, you'll see. But I, for one, was VERY happy with the ending...which is open to more IMO!Any one who loves gritty urban sexy hot vampires should like this series. Start with Nicholas and Kit's story.

In this novella we meet Nicolas. He has lost his mate. He is hurt and trying to find his way back. Can he love again? Is it a possibility for him? This world that she has created in this novella simply made me want to run out and get all the books today. Vampires and Saints, clans it is all very interesting and I was caught up. It only quenched the thirst though.. left me wanting more. Nicolas intrigues me, he is all hard exterior and tough. Although he seems to be so much more. In this book Kitara is trying to find out what is going on with Jeremy. (Ex)We have Danger- Saints- Nicolas - overall it is one hell of a crazy ride. Betrayal - omg! You have no idea. I got to meet others too.. Lysander. Yes he alone could make me read her other books. Wow! Is it hot in here or is it just me? Errr .. Lol! Throw in a dash of Nicolas.. Yes this little novella packs a hot punch ladies! Fanning myself recalling a scene or two. This book introduced me to several characters and allowed me to see the authors style. Which I have decided I love. Witty banter, humor, and sexual situations. She writes in a manor your lost in her world completely. Will Kitara be ok, or will the betrayal be the end?

Just like the first five books in this series, I absolutely loved this book! It revisits some of your favorite characters , and introduces you to new ones. I was a bit anxious because this was Nicholas story, and I was not ready for him to move on so soon after his beloved mate Rozaline had died, I was pleasantly surprised that the heroine Kitara has me not only sympathizing with her, but soon I found myself rooting for them to become a couple! Kitara is a spunky Witch that was searching for her long term boyfriend that had just up and dumped her for the Cult Acta Sanctorum, a bunch of religious bigoted fanatics. Unwilling to just give up on their love, she follows him, right into danger. Nicholas an ancient vampire is a male in pain, the deep agony of losing his centuries long mate Rozaline, weighs him deeply. He is a man on a mission to take out as many Saints the minions of the Acta Sanctorum as he can, it was while on one of his hunts that he saves a women Kitara, and ends up rescuing her several more times after that as well. Nicholas's chivalry and saving her goes against everything her ex has told her about those vampire monsters, in fact as she is targeted by the Acta Sanctorum , she discovers it is they that are the real monsters! I really enjoyed this book! I was enchanted by this gutsy woman going after answers, and the way she handles herself when her ex's true colors finally show!

This is what I expect from Katie! Dark Salvations is a sweet action packed tale about Nicholas getting over his heartbreak. It\u2019s really nice to meet a character in Kit that doesn\u2019t really know about the supernatural world, even though she is pretty much a witch. I loved watching Nicholas grow and soften this time around, you really got to see a different, believable side to him and connect as a reader.This story was given 4 stars instead of 5 was for 2 reasons. I just couldn\u2019t find Kit\u2019s obsession with her ex Jeremy realistic. At first, I get that you\u2019d follow your love, try to fix what went wrong, but after that person tells you that basically you are an abomination to everything he now believes in maybe you start looking for a new life plan; certainly after he lures you into a trap to be abducted because you still keep calling. The other thing that took away from the story was the dialog. If you have been reading my reviews along the way you know this is a pet peeve of mine; just cheesy enough to be distracting.Overall, this is a great way to break up the series a little bit or even end it.

The plot-line of Dark Salvation allows Katie Salidas to explore all of Nicholas' characteristics further, and though I may have sympathised with and even admired him in earlier books, by the finish of this story I actually liked him and his humour (however dark!) made me smile!Kitara is the influence on Nicholas' mood; a witch reluctant to admit her paranormal powers due to the fact her partner left her to join the Acta Sanctorum. Kitara and Nicholas immediately connect, as they both save each others life in the few days they know one another.Although only a novella I loved the intensity of Dark Salvation; the fact that we finally see past Nicholas' hard exterior and Katie Salidas never forgets the action scenes!I will miss my weekly dose of the Immortalis books! If you haven't read this series yet I definitely recommend them . . ."}, {"userName": "Ashley Dawn", "userReviewDate": "May 10, 2013", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/4278629-ashley-dawn", "userReview": "I was so happy to see Nicholas' book!! Nicholas is tired of waiting for the Acta Sanctorum to make a move. He has been vigilant at keeping watch for them but nothing so far. Kitara isn't happy when she meets up with Nicholas but there is something that draws her to him. The fact that she is looking for her Acta Sanctorum fiance should have warned him away but Nicholas just cannot resist. Knowing she has powers of her own, Nicholas is determined to protect Kit no matter who he is up against.I literally couldn't wait to read Nicholas' book. His story has been wonderfully sad up to this point. Kit was perfect for him. A witch with plenty of power (though you shouldn't call her that!) she can hold her own against him. Their chemistry is undeniable and hot! His propensity for saving her life and his jerkish attitude should completely put her off but it actually tugs Kit in more. It was a great storyline and I absolutely love Kit now! I loved catching up with some of the other characters as well and seeing where they are.I rate this a 5/5. If you've read the series up to this point, it is a must read. If you haven't read the series, it is a good vampire/werewolf series!***This book contains adult content***"}, {"userName": "Christina M Condy", "userReviewDate": "Apr 27, 2013", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/11080017-christina-m-condy", "userReview": "This story is about Nicholas and Kitara. It is a Novella of the Immortalis series but it CAN be read as a standalone. In this book we learn much more about Nicholas and how he deals with the loss of his mate Rozaline. His suffering has definitely caused a problem in the vampire clan. I won't go into any details but suffice it to say that the unexpected should be expected when reading this book!The characters are fabulous as we expect from Katie Salidas. And Nicholas does not disappoint the readers at all. I have to say I highly recommend this book and the series as a whole!I am looking forward to many more stories from the Immortalis series. This particular book is a short read and can easily be read in just a few hours since it only has 124 pages, unless your like me and just basically absorbs a book through osmosis in which case you can finish it in less than an hour. Shhhh don't tell my husband but I snuck this book in for a bedtime read long after he had fallen asleep. And I for one do not regret missing out on that hour of sleep for this book!Details/Disclaimer: Review copy was provided to me in exchange for a fair and honest review. The free book held no determination on my personal review."}, {"userName": "Carin", "userReviewDate": "May 09, 2013", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/2236215-carin", "userReview": "Dark Salvation is the 6th in the Immortalis Vampire series, the story stands by itself but is in better context when read as part of the series.Nicholas has been a vampire since before Brutus stabbed Cesar and having lost his mate doesn't feel like he has a whole lot of reason to go on. Kitara has lost her man to the cult of the Saints, Acta Sanctorum, vampire hunters because she is a witch. She tracks him from Texas to Boston to try to reason with him. That's how she meets Nicholas.Ms. Salidas gives us a fantastic look into what it must be like to be immortal. Dark Salvation is at time funny, suspenseful, steamy and even touching with the devotion in the face of loss that both Nicholas and Kitara face. The world created here has werewolves, vampires that are thousands of years old as well as newly turned vampires, witches and religious fanatics who's goal is to wipe out anything that is not 1oo% human. I love the many personalities of the different vampire characters and that they hunt the bad people to suck dry. This is a fun and sexy read that you will enjoy alone or as part of the series."}, {"userName": "Katie", "userReviewDate": "May 20, 2013", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/6921223-katie", "userReview": "Once I started this book I could not put it down, i had to know what happen next. If you have read the series you all know that there different story's, this one is about Nicolas Story, how he is coping with losing his mate and opening up to love again. I love Lysander and Alyssa am glad we get a glimpse of them in the story. Nicholas meets the beautiful Kitara and soon starts to fall in love with her. Kitara wonders why her boyfriend left her and joined the Saints. She knows she is different but she never has used her powers before. Kitara decides to find out where Jeremy is and Nicholas but can't help saved Kitara from the Saints. I could go on about this awesome book, but i don't won't to ruin it for you. If you haven't read this book you need to.

This book is amazing. I immediately fell in love with the characters. Nicholas has this darkness and sadness surrounding him yet you know there is more underneath. Kitara is spunky and determined. She is stubborn and strong willed, going after what she wants. You have to love a strong female lead. There are other characters that I cant wait to see develop as I dive into the other books.Katie did an amazing job with the plot of this book. It flows extremely well and I never reached a dull moment. It flows too good and it was over too soon. lol. With her other books I will remember to pace myself so I can make the stories last.A definite recommendation to every bookie I know!!!"}, {"userName": "Kristen Lewendon", "userReviewDate": "Sep 21, 2016", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/5041965-kristen-lewendon", "userReview": "I wasn't quite sure what to think about Nicholas at first, but as I got to learn more about him through the course of the series he turned into one of my favorite characters. My heart broke for him when Rozaline was killed so I'm very glad to see he gets a happily-eternal-after just like Lysander does. Kitara is a perfect pairing for him. She has a backbone of solid steel that allows her to hold her ground against him when she knows she's right and she has a great big, romantic heart that gives her the ability to see the best in people whether they deserve it or not.

Whispered threats of the Acta Sanctorum\u2019s return have the supernatural world abuzz. Only recently aware of the other world hidden behind our own, Kitara Vanders has barely scratched the surface of what being supernatural truly means. A special woman in her own right, she possesses unique telepathic abilities, gifts that have recently come under the scrutiny of the Acta Sanctorum, a fanatical organization whose mission is to cleanse the world of anything supernatural. Targeted and marked for death, Kitara\u2019s only hope lies with the lethally seductive yet emotionally scarred warrior Nicholas. Knowing full well the atrocities of which the Acta Sanctorum is capable, Nicholas is all too eager for the battle to begin. Fueled by pain and rage from the loss of his mate, he\u2019s itching for a fight, but one thing stands in his way: Kitara, a beautiful dark-haired woman with unique psychic abilities and an unusual link to the Saints. Despite his resolve to remain focused on his mission, a purely physical relationship binds them together in a way neither of them expected. And when her life hangs in the balance, Nicholas finds his own is teetering on the edge too.", "title": "Dark Salvation\n      \n          (Immortalis #5)", "url": "https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/17704071-dark-salvation", "average": 4.31, "cover": "https://images.gr-assets.com/books/1364698387l/17704071.jpg", "reviews": 30, "authors": [{"url": "https://www.goodreads.com/author/show/3395431.Katie_Salidas", "name": "Katie Salidas"}], "type": ["Paranormal", "Fantasy", "Romance", "Fantasy", "Romance"], "outlinks": ["http://www.goodreads.com/book/show/17704071-dark-salvation", "http://www.goodreads.com/book/show/31424653-carpe-noctem", "http://www.goodreads.com/book/show/25373764-pretty-little-werewolf", "http://www.goodreads.com/book/show/31424681-hunters-prey", "http://www.goodreads.com/book/show/34231993-dissension", "http://www.goodreads.com/book/show/31424696-pandora-s-box"]}
