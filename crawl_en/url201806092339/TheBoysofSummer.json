But one does not come away from visits with them, from long nights remembering the past and considering the present, full of sorrow. In the end, quite the other way, one is renewed.\u201d\nSince the moment I was aware enough to process sounds and know what they mean, I\u2019ve been a Kansas City Royals fan. From opening day until the final out, my father had the AM radio tuned to the Royals baseball games. Even when he wasn\u2019t in the house, the radio would still be on with the sounds of the crowd, the sharp crack of a bat, and the exciting play by play commentary of the announcer punctuating the silence of a hot summer afternoon. When I got old enough to ride the tractor with my father, we would listen to the game together as the ruts of the field would bounce us from side to side. Baseball made the world seem bigger. My father was a dominate pitcher in high school. He\u2019d pitch complete games, sometimes two or three times a week. His back has a permanent curvature to his spine from all that pitching. This was an era before they had rules and regulations in place to protect young, developing athletes. He was recruited to play college ball. He had thoughts of being an engineer. Going to school and playing baseball were just dreams caught in dust motes...drifting...drifting...uncatchable. Roger Kahn\u2019s father introduced him to baseball. His mother was a serious academic, and she considered the excited discussions about dem bums, the Brooklyn Dodgers, a detriment to the development of her son\u2019s mind. Kahn grew up being able to talk baseball with his father and Ulysses with his mother. When he later became a sports writer, both parents would prove to have an equal amount of influence on how he saw the game of baseball and how he wrote about it.When I was going to college in Tucson, I rented a two bedroom house just off of campus. Whenever the Wildcat football team would score, I could hear the roar of the crowd, and whenever something went wrong for the team, I could hear the collective groans. To some people who visited me this was annoying, but for me it only brought back fond memories of listening to the crowd react to a baseball game from the radio on the farm. Kahn lived in Brooklyn close enough to Ebbets Field that he could listen to the game on the radio and hear the reactions from the crowd seconds later. \u201dWhen the wind blew from the south and the French doors had been opened, the sound of cheering carried from Ebbets Field into the apartment.\u201d\nThe High Flying Pee Wee Reese.I don\u2019t remember how I first learned that the Los Angeles Dodgers used to be in Brooklyn, but I do remember asking my father about it. He got a grin on his face and said \u201cPee Wee Reese.\u201d I thought to myself what an odd name for a ballplayer. Reese had been one of my Dad\u2019s favorite players because, when he wasn\u2019t pitching, he played shortstop and had hopes of playing half as good as Pee Wee Reese. The Dodgers lost seven championships before finally winning in 1955. Five of those losses were to their rivals the New York Yankees. I wonder, if they had won more World Series championships, if we would still be calling them the Brooklyn Trolley Dodgers. Of course as a kid, I didn\u2019t have a clue about finances or the lure of California that brought the Giants and the Dodgers to the Golden state out West. It hadn\u2019t even occurred to me that you could move a baseball team. I thought to myself, what would I do if they moved the Royals? Kahn had the privilege of covering the Brooklyn Dodgers in the 1950s. He got to know Pee Wee Reese, Gil Hodges, Duke Snyder, Carl Furillo, Roy Campanella, Carl Erskine, Joe Black, and the great one, Jackie Robinson. When I say he knew them, I mean he really knew them. He traveled with the team. He saw them when they were ecstatic, when they were angry, when they were at their best and at their worst. We all know from documentaries, films, and slews of books about the trials and tribulations of Jackie Robinson, but I think sometimes in that narrative we forget about how important it was that the white shortstop from Kentucky offered his friendship to a black man from Georgia. \nJackie Robinson and Pee Wee Reese.Reese could have easily been a man of his time. He could have embraced what for the South has almost been a cultural heritage of racism. When he looked at Jackie Robinson, he didn\u2019t just see a black man; he saw a man who could really play baseball and a man who could help the Dodgers win. In the book, there is this poignant moment when Joe Black, a pitcher for the Dodgers, relates how he had always wanted to play baseball. He kept scrapbooks of all the clippings of his favorite players. He was a senior in high school when he asked a baseball scout why he was signing all these other guys, but hadn\u2019t tried to sign him. That is the moment when he realized that \u201ccolored\u201d men didn\u2019t play in the major leagues. I find it a testament to his character that he had collected those newspaper articles and had followed the careers of his favorite ball players, and it never occurred to him that they were white and that none of them were black. When he went back through his scrapbook, he really peered at all the faces and for the first time saw them as white men instead of as men who were really good at playing baseball. He had been color blind until others forced him to see.\nJoe BlackWhat Kahn does with this book is explore his relationship with his father. A relationship that cannot be separated from the lives of the Brooklyn Dodgers. We meet the players while they were playing and then again in their lives after baseball. There is a tinge of melancholy about the book that left me feeling a bit blue. We see these athletes at the height of the power, and then we see them later as construction workers, grocery store owners, successful entrepreneurs, and failed dreamers. Life has not been easy for most of them. They played in an era before players were receiving mega deals that made them millionaires. Few retired from baseball in the 1950s rich enough to retire from working. It has taken me a while to realize this, but regardless of whether you are a famous baseball player, a teacher, a piano player in a nightclub, a writer, or a circulation manager, life is tough and uncertain and rarely follows the script of our life that we had conceptualized in our heads. A few years ago, I was talking to a young man on his farm, and his grandfather, who I thought was half asleep on his feet, perked up when he heard my name. He said, \u201cAre you related to Dean Keeten?\u201d I thought he must be talking about my father Donald because we all have the family name of Dean, but he quickly set me straight. He was asking about my grandfather. \u201cDid you ever see him play baseball?\u201d he asked. I explained that he had died in 1954 long before I was born. He laughed and said, \u201cI\u2019ve never seen anyone get from first to third as quickly as your grandfather.\u201d I could see the images of long ago baseball games flickering behind the thin membrane of his eyelids. Men long dead were alive again brushing dirt from their pants after a slide into third or making an over the shoulder catch with a glove barely bigger than their hand. My grandfather was a hard working man, but he would stop everything when it was time to play baseball. In those years, every town had a baseball team that would play against other town teams. It was serious business, a game played by men not boys, and winning was as important as a bumper wheat crop.For a few moments my Grandfather shimmered to life through the eyes of a man who actually got to see him play baseball. Roy Campanella\u2019s career was cut short by a car accident in 1958 that severed his spine, leaving him paralysed. I could feel the trepidation in Kahn as he prepared to go see him. He found Roy whirling about in an electric chair that he controlled with the palm of one hand. His once powerful legs had withered to a fraction of their normal size. He was reduced, but not diminished. His larger than life personality was still sustaining him. \u201dHe pushed the lever and the wheelchair started off bearing the broken body and leaving me\u2026, to marvel at the vaulting human spirit, imprisoned yet free, in the noble wreckage of the athlete, in the dazzling palace of the man.\u201d\nRoy CampanellaI don\u2019t really know what it is about baseball. Annie Savoy in the movie Bull Durham says: \u201dBaseball may be a religion full of magic, cosmic truth, and the fundamental ontological riddles of our time, but it's also a job.\u201d It\u2019s a game that will break your goddamned heart and make you weep for joy, sometimes mere moments apart. In 1980, the Royals finally got passed those boys in pinstripes to go to the World Series. We were all so invested in that team. My mother, who never watched sports before, had followed their exploits all season long and had gotten to know their names. She cheered and fretted as George Brett flirted with hitting .400. He finally ended the season at .390. The Philadelphia Phillies behind the amazing pitching of Tug McGraw dispatched the Royals in six. The nation had become enamored with the plucky Royals, and game six of the 1980 World Series still holds the record for the most TV watchers of a World Series game. I was sitting on the floor with my chin resting on my elbows, contemplating the reality that the Royals had lost. How could we lose? We had George Brett! I was starting to hope that all this had just been a nightmare, and I was going to wake up to a new day with game six unplayed. I felt tears sting my eyes and knew that the fact that we had lost was already starting to become coal dust memories. I heard my mother sob. I rolled over and looked at her on the couch with tears rolling down her cheeks. I got up and gave her a hug, and then she started to sob for real. I\u2019d seen her cry before, but I\u2019d never seen her cry like this before. The players may have lost the game, but we lost something a lot more precious...a dream.The Royals did get a chance to redeem themselves in 1985. We had our Tug McGraw that year, a young phenom pitcher named Bret Saberhagen, and then I had a chance to see my mother cry tears of joy. Whether it is dem bums in Brooklyn or the Cubbies or the Miracle Mets, they have all left an indelible mark on their fans. There has been a lot of speculation about whether Walt Whitman ever said this, that maybe Annie Savoy took liberties with Whitman\u2019s words, but I choose to believe that Whitman was the right man to have said it: \"I see great things in baseball. It's our game, the American game. It will repair our losses and be a blessing to us.\"\n#42 Jackie RobinsonThe Church of Baseball has been safe in the hands of Roger Kahn. He caught the magic of a diamond of green grass under a blue sky. I kept having to brush the popcorn and the peanut shells from the leaves of the book. I could feel the leather on my left hand as my eye searched the sky for the speck of white. I\u2019m sure, like all of us, Kahn wished he could say one more time: \u201dHey...Dad? You wanna have a catch.\u201dIf you wish to see more of my most recent book and movie reviews, visit http://www.jeffreykeeten.comI also have a Facebook blogger page at:https://www.facebook.com/JeffreyKeeten"}, {"userName": "Fred Shaw", "userReviewDate": "Aug 22, 2017", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/44212467-fred-shaw", "userReview": "The Boys of SummerBy Roger KahnKindle edition5 StarsThe Boys of Summer is the story of the Brooklyn Dodgers when the best came to play baseball: Pee Wee Reese, Duke Snider, Carl Furillo, Gil Hodges, Billy Cox, Roy Campanella, Carl Erskine, Clem Labine, Billy Cox, Jackie Robinson. That\u2019s right sports fans, \u201cBrooklyn Dodgers\u201d. At one time there were 3 MLB clubs in New York City: The Brooklyn Dodgers, played at Ebbets Field, The New York Giants played at the Polo Grounds, and The New York Yankees, played at Yankees Stadium. All but one left for California in the 50\u2019s and 60\u2019s: The Yankees.Roger Kahn has written an excellent history of the times and players of The Brooklyn Dodgers. A reporter for the Herald Tribune in 1951, Kahn was assigned to cover the team, which meant he was at every game, both at home and away. He traveled with the team, coaches and management, having first hand access. In the first part of the book, he covered players abilities, Penant races and World Series games in some detail. But I enjoyed the second and last part of the book where he met with each of the players after they left the game, interviewed them and talked of their memories of playing, what it was like once they left. The players had a love hate relationship with writers because of how their play might be described in the morning edition: as hero or goat. The writers also walked a fine line. If they dropped a bomb about a rumor trade of a player in the papers, before the player heard about it, this could dry up their sources pretty quick. All of those Dodgers to a man accepted Kahn and welcomed him in their homes.The Dodgers got their name from pedestrians \u201cdodging\u201d the fast trolley cars to get to Ebbets Field in the early 1900\u2019s. They were the first to add lights at the stadium for night games and they were the first to break the color barrier and hire a black player, Jackie Robinson. Its hard to imagine the strenghth it took for Robinson to sign, even more than the risk the Dodgers took with this revolutionary move. But Robinson had come, not to play baseball, but to be the best player ever, and not to win games but to beat the opponent. He was such a stellar player that he was quickly accepted by the wishy washy Brooklyn fans and attendance soared. Yes he was playing pro ball, but he had huge obstacles to overcome that only a certain kind of individual would have the innate tools to survive. Imagine if you will, being a member of the team, but could not stay in the same hotel or eat in the same restaurants, or ride in the same railroad car as the rest of the team. When Jackie played at opposing team baseball parks, fans and the other team would call him names and throw things at him because of his skin color. This book was pure nostalgia for me. I was a young boy when the Dodgers played in Brooklyn and later on I listenend to Pee Wee Reese, one of those stellar Dodger short stops, call the games on TV after he retired from baseball. If you love baseball and its history you\u2019ll love this book."}, {"userName": "Douglas", "userReviewDate": "Jan 29, 2012", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/3020662-douglas", "userReview": "You really can't pick a better book to read in the throes of summer, or in any season of life, for that matter. More than a book about baseball or summer, this is a book about living and what makes living so good. The Boys, ascending from unassuming childhoods and lowly towns, somehow seemed fated to achieve the greatness that was the Brooklyn Dodgers of the 1940's and 1950's. And what's more, Roger Kahn, one of the great sports writers that ever lived, was destined to be their chronicler. The Boys of Summer was so well written, and the story so well-told, I began to grieve for all the other teams and stories of sport that never converged with the bard-like quality of Kahn. The Boys of Summer is divided into two sections, the first being a historical account of the writer growing up near Dodger Stadium and subsequently being assigned to cover the team as a sports writer, and the second section, is an homage and an update on the individual players that made up the famous Jackie Robinson team of the 1950's. I've read a few reviews and critiques that have suggested that the two sections seem disjointed and could've been two separate books. I disagree. The two sections work like counterpoint to show that a truly great team really never stops being just that. Even as most of the Boys amble back to their humble beginnings, the greatness and significance of their accomplishment as a team never diminishes. This is the book that every great sportsman and every great true story deserves."}, {"userName": "Chris", "userReviewDate": "Aug 29, 2007", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/36341-chris", "userReview": "I requested this book from the library expecting to love it, but the first few pages were so choked with baseball nostalgia of endless days of summer, boys growing to be gods in the green cathedrals of yesteryear, the tragic ending in the bitter days of autumn, blah blah blah. I almost put it down before I got through the intro. But I'm very glad I kept at it, because it ended up being wonderful -- if not at all what I expected when I decided to read it.I thought I was going to get the story of the 50's Brooklyn Dodgers, which the book is only partly about. What I got was two books -- Kahn's memoir of growing up in Brooklyn (which itself is drenched in that special sort of Old Brooklyn nostalgia, but it has its own kitchen appeal), becoming a journalist, and his experience reporting on the team. It is very personal, and very revealing of the people and society of the time. The spirit of the book circles around Jackie Robinson, but Kahn does Robinson a great service by NOT making the book about him, and instead casting him as a talented ball player, who just happened to be strong enough and stubborn enough to shoulder the burden of the civil rights movement, but who also was just one part of an amazing baseball team. The second book is what I wasn't expecting, but was even more engaging -- Kahn tracks down all the players in the 70's and writes about what happened to them since. No one will even be able to write this book again, as if you track down A-Rod and Derek Jeter in 20 years, they'll still be living in their mansions and dating models. The ballplayers in the 50's retired to get middle-management jobs or tend bars, gaining weight and moving on as regular men who just happened to be super-stars for a few brief years in their youth. It When Kahn explicitly writes about baseball, he gets overblown and syrupy sweet, but strangely when he writes about the men who played the game -- which 90% of the book is -- he allows them and their actions to speak for themselves. He could easily have beaten \"the twilight of the gods\" themes to death, but wisely opts for restraint, which actually lends the boom more power."}, {"userName": "Donna", "userReviewDate": "Feb 05, 2016", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/13244359-donna", "userReview": "I liked this book and since this is coming from someone who dislikes baseball (a lot), that is high praise indeed. I loved the voice in this. It was very \"folksy\"; it felt personal and the love of the game came through loud and clear. The author was engaging. I liked that this book focused on the players of this early era, more than the sport itself. It also touched on civil rights and the first few African Americans who played major ball. Sometimes I get to the end of the book and wonder about the title. Not so here. The title was perfect."}, {"userName": "Harold Kasselman", "userReviewDate": "Mar 14, 2013", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/16965781-harold-kasselman", "userReview": "Ok, so I finally decided to read \"Boys Of Summer\" and I'm melancholy. I have just gone through an emotional ride with the epilogue. This is a wonderful book. I was hesitant the first 80 pages to understand why the book was heralded as great and then I understood. The inside look at the life of great sports reporters,the insider voices of Durocher the antagonist and Robinson's responses, the feeling amongst the team when they began to win, the insecurity of the Duke even at his prime,the humorous stories that were told, the feeling of alienation by Furillo, the courage of Reese and Robinson, the battle for equality in baseball.  The second part of the book is melancholy because it looks at men in the pre-Marvin Miller era who really had to make a living after being idolized by millions. Furillo was a construction worker who ate from a brown bag lunch. Bill Cox was a small town bartender etc. That will never happen again to the \"new\" Boys of Summer who play today's game. This is a wonderfully written work and homage by a man who became the Herald Tribune' sports reporter for the Dodgers at age 24. There is so much to say about the book but others with much better writing skills have said it. I'll tell one story that I never knew. In the late 40,s Walter O'Malley had two other partners.One was Branch Rickey. When the third died, Rickey sought to sell his private stock to Joe Kennedy.The latter wanted to buy the team for his son John who was not in great health. O'Malley balked and Kennedy backed out because he didn't want a clash with a minority owner. As O'Malley later said, if He(O'Malley) had agreed Kennedy might be sitting in his chairman's chair right now and still be alive. That is something to think about."}, {"userName": "Porter Kelly", "userReviewDate": "May 01, 2013", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/6021384-porter-kelly", "userReview": "I read this in high school.

He starts with memories of his childhood, attending baseball games at Ebbets field with his dad, establishing the foundation for his life-long love of the game. He then takes us through his brief but memorable time as a sportswriter for the Brooklyn Dodgers, getting to know the team members personally, and how they and others reacted to the introduction of black players. (Some of this treatment was appalling \u2013 I\u2019d like to think we\u2019ve come a long way as a society since those days). Finally, he expands into book-writing, and brings the story full-circle by traveling to visit many of the Dodger players of the early 50\u2019s, and providing a glimpse into their post-baseball lives. I was impressed with the author\u2019s fluid, poetic style, and his flair for story-telling. I could visualize the places to which he traveled. Although it was not a page-turner for me, I enjoyed it when I picked it up. Contains locker room language and commentary of the time-period (e.g., using the term mongoloid for a person with Downs Syndrome, and showing women in mostly subservient roles). It is filled with episodes of melancholy, tenderness, roughness, and humor. One of my favorite humorous asides was when Kahn describes reading Joyce aloud with his family on Wednesday nights and imagining the reactions of his Dodger buddies. Highly recommended for baseball fans, especially those interested in baseball history or the history of the Dodgers. Favorite quotes:\u201cYou may glory in a team triumphant, but you fall in love with a team in defeat.\u201d\u201cLosing after great striving is the story of man, who was born to sorrow, whose sweetest songs tell of saddest thought, and who, if he is a hero, does nothing in life as becomingly as leaving it.\u201d \u201cChoker and hero are two masks for the same plain face.\u201d\u201cTo disregard color, even for an instant, is to step away from the old prejudices, the old hatred.

Now I know why -- it's not a book for a 13-year-old. It's about aging, and disappointment, and nostalgia, and its very good at exploring these emotions through the lens of the Brooklyn Dodgers of the early 1950s. I enjoyed the baseball very much, and also liked the way Kahn wove in both his own life story and the stories of several players, as athletes and as people. It's striking how much the tale is shot through with race relations in general and the heroism of Jackie Robinson in particular -- even as I learn more and read more I'm still astounded by how fundamental race (and particularly white racism against blacks) has been at so many stages of our nation's history. I think it says something that that was my takeaway about both this book of baseball nostalgia and Joseph Ellis's Founding Brothers about our nation's early history...but it's nice in this sad, complicated story to have some real heroes like Robinson fighting to help our country become better."}, {"userName": "Len Washko", "userReviewDate": "Mar 24, 2011", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/4228979-len-washko", "userReview": "Very much enjoyed - savored every word, every phrase.

Reading it as a 52 year old man (it was written by a 52 year old man) I find it is not a baseball book at all - but a memoir, a tribute to Kahn's father and family, a sweet remembrance of his initiation as a young beat writer covering the Dodgers, and a lament (and again a tribute) to the his aging childhood heroes... the Jackie Robinson Dodgers. this is sweet book, and Kahn writes so well. So honest, no apologies, no inhibitions whatsoever. I realize why I thought it was a baseball book - it has a lot of charming baseball stories.

The Boys of Summer is an outstanding read whether you're a fan of the game or not, I'd wager. Like any good long form piece of journalism, it's less about the thing the people do and more about the people themselves.Broken up into two parts - Roger Kahn starts by detailing what it was like growing up in Brooklyn as a young baseball fan, especially of the Dodgers. He is confessional about his family life - mostly positive, though his mother was not all that supportive of baseball-related pursuits - and then he kind of lucks his way into covering the team of his childhood and the players littering the roster - Jackie Robinson, Pee Wee Reese, Joe Black, Roy Campanella, Duke Snider, et. al. He only covered the team for two seasons before embarking on a career as a magazine writer, at which point I was confused how there was another half of the book (no way he has that many references). At first, I was reluctant to follow him on his quest to revisit these players years after retirement. It seemed unimportant. For me, the reason I picked up the book was for the chronicle of the road and the lives of ballplayers. Well, stupid me, the life of the ballplayer doesn't end at retirement and this second half is essential - perhaps more than even what came before it.Kahn doesn't shy away from criticism or simple honesty, either. Sure, he formed bonds with some (Reese and Robinson in particular) but that didn't stop him from telling earnest, true accounts of his dealings during careers and in the years afterward. In the afterword or epilogue, written for a later edition, he talks about initial reviews of the book where critics differed on what didn't work. One critic took the angle I expected to take, saying the lives after the game were unnecessary for the book. Another loved that part but didn't give a damn about his life growing up in Brooklyn. They criticized him for essentially writing two books instead of one...but, the assumption that any story requires a formula and can't veer from course is flawed at best. The Boys of Summer each joined the Brooklyn Dodgers coming from very different backgrounds and histories and each receded from that life into diverging futures. The chronicle Kahn has put together here joins them both beautifully."}, {"userName": "Tim", "userReviewDate": "Aug 04, 2011", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/4411781-tim", "userReview": "What I disliked about this book: I would NOT agree with those that called this book \"America's finest book on sports\". I think the problem is... the majority of the book was about \"where are they now\". When the book was originally published in 1972, most of the readers were very familiar with the players. Now-a-days, the readers are not. I was interested to hear more about the ballplayers as ballplayers and more about how the season went. I've heard that the 1952 World Series was one of the greatest ever, but there just wasn't enough detail in these areas to appease me.What I liked about the book: I did learn about the fans love of the Dodgers and I understand more why the move from Brooklyn to L.A. was devastating. I also did learn more about the ballplayers, it's just not the way that I wanted to learn.

However, be aware: It is the very opposite of a \"feel good\" read. In fact, I can scarcely remember a book that is so suffocatingly sad. The players of the Brooklyn Dodgers of the early Fifties (as well as a number of others associated with the team in various ways) experienced an unusually high number of foreshortened careers, personal tragedies (especially involving sons), and early deaths. It doesn't make for a cheerful book.Is professional sports inherently a tragic enterprise? Kahn suggests as much. It may not really be that desirable to hit the peak of your life at age 25, with the skills for which you are valued in inevitable decline after that, and your ability to do what you do at all almost certainly over by age 40. Maybe the money makes up for this, and of course the money is better now than it used to be, but you wonder. It could be that Kahn makes just a little too much of the aging issue, partly because of the fact that he is focusing on athletes, partly because attitudes were different then. He persistently describes a man's forties as a kind of middle-aged twilight, and I don't think that we look at it that way anymore (which is a good change!). Athletes still age out of their sports, of course, but a lot of them are thinking about that inevitability early on, planning their future careers in sports management or broadcasting or other businesses or even politics. One gets the sense that the old-time ballplayers didn't look ahead in that way, and faded back into ordinary life without much mental preparation. Some wound up doing OK, but many did not."}, {"userName": "Adam", "userReviewDate": "Dec 26, 2017", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/6082038-adam", "userReview": "Classic 1971 baseball memoir about the Brooklyn Dodgers.

Literature to me was Sparky Lyle's Bronx Zoo or Mickey Mantle's Quality of Courage. I would sit in the floor at Walden Books and read Bill James Baseball Abstract. Always nearby was this Boys of Summer about the hated Dodgers. I had no interest. In my habit of collecting books I bought a used copy a few years ago, but it never got off the shelf. Not until last week when I saw that Sports Illustrated rated it #2 on the best sports books of all time did I acquiesce. And it was not at all what I expected. It begins as a personal memoir growing up with the Dodgers in Brooklyn. Doris Kearns Goodwin would write a whole book her own experience years later. The second part is the author's experience covering the Dodger in the 1950s for a newspaper. The third part is the author's experience tracking down the retired players in the late 1960s and talking to them much like Lawrence Ritter does in The Glory of their Times.It's really the hodgepodge in construction and it shouldn't work as a complete book and yet it's compelling and satisfying when you finish. I have to credit Kahn who finds the human being inside each ballplayer and gives us more than even the player knows he is giving. Not knowing much about the Dodgers I didn't know about the rivalry between Campanella and Robinson or how Carl Furillo felt like an outsider on the team. I knew more about Gil Hodges during his time as manager of the Mets than as a ballplayer. I didn't know that the Duke was from southern California so the Dodgers move was a perfect fit for him. Kahn wrote his book before Robert Caro published his book on Robert Moses so Kahn is a little bit harsh to Walter O'Malley for moving the Dodgers west. Moses wanted the Dodgers in Queens where the Mets wound up. O'Malley wanted a better Brooklyn location close to public transportation. O'Malley had no chance against Moses. Kahn doesn't even address this in the postscript chapter from the 1990s and it's a shame. O'Malley made a good move to take the Dodgers to LA. In fact, the myth of the Brooklyn Dodgers is a much better one with the Dodgers gone."}, {"userName": "A.

The second is, without a doubt, true; the first is also true, but only incidentally. This is not a book about the Dodgers: It\u2019s a book about growing up, growing old, and other Big Issues, for which the Dodgers act as a touchstone.The book is divided into three unequal acts: a kaleidoscopic memoir of a Brooklyn childhood; a shorter, tighter narrative of Kahn\u2019s days as a journeyman sportswriter, covering the team for the New York Herald Tribune; and a series of chapter-length stories about Kahn re-visiting the Dodger players he once knew, a decade or more after their playing days had ended. There is, as a result, more Kahn and less baseball here than the book\u2019s reputation as a classic baseball book would suggest. What baseball there is comes as glimpses, rather than games (much less series). Having read all of the first two sections, and some of the third, I know the man -- but not his team, or the game -- better. Kahn gave me reason to think about fathers, about heroes, about growing up and growing old, and about the second acts that Fitzgerald denied Americans could have in their lives. He did nothing, though, for my grasp of of Duke Snider\u2019s hitting, Preacher Roe\u2019s spitball, or Jackie Robinson\u2019s base-running.No matter. Kahn, I discover, has written a book about the trio of New York ball clubs that dominated the game from 1947 to 1957. If it\u2019s written with the same eye for unexpected detail, and ear for an elegant phrase, as this one, it\u2019ll be a delight to read."}, {"userName": "Justin Oh", "userReviewDate": "Nov 14, 2013", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/12025512-justin-oh", "userReview": "This book is very interesting. It has two parts to it. The first part of the book talks about his career as a young reporter. He grew up being a Brooklyn Dodgers fan and now he can report for the team. He felt like he was part of the team. Also this wasn't just no ordinary season for the Dodgers. It was when Jackie Robinson was playing when blacks couldn't play this game of baseball.The second part of the book talks about the players itself. How good they were and how they won and went the the world series twice but lost to the Yankees both times. It also talked about how Jackie Robinson changed the game for all African Americans who wanted to play. He makes it into a humorous book so its pretty funny. But this book also talks about the player's lives after there prime. He writes about them after they retired or got injured and get the reactions or thoughts on there career. Its funny but at the same time its sad.In the book it tells us about Roy Campanella who is now quadriplegic talking about his glory days and his past while in tears. Then later on its talks about the death of Jackie Robinson's son, who died from a car crash at 24. And finally Pee Wee Reese who is almost about to die and his final moments when he was alive.This book has everything. Its funny, exciting, and sad. This book is not all about baseball so its good for those who don't know the sport very well. I recommend this book."}, {"userName": "Jay", "userReviewDate": "Jun 05, 2015", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/1618357-jay", "userReview": "There were two things that kept this from being a five star book for me. One was the focus on the author in the beginning of the book \u2013 too much autobiography of a Brooklyn kid growing up and having characters as relatives and friends, and becoming a journalist (more characters involved here as well). This entire section I didn\u2019t expect \u2013 who knew \u201cThe Boys of Summer\u201d referred to sports writers? I think I might have enjoyed it more as a stand-alone book \u2013 life of a sports writer in and out of sports, filed with Journalism in the library. Second was the way the player\u2019s story\u2019s were told. The stories of the players, highlights from their prime seasons followed with their how they lived when they were tracked down after a few decades, are excellent \u2013 humorous, full of pathos. But there have been so many books written in the same way focusing on single players (\u201cThe Last Boy\u201d or \u201cSandy Kofax\u201d), or even teams (\u201cThe Teammates\u201d) that this will get lost in my memory. So it\u2019s not really a weakness in the book when it was written, but in how it stands up over time. A success is copied, and the copies wear away at the success. Nevertheless, an excellent book showing time marches on and heroes are forgotten, but also showing the unexpected staying power of being on a close-knit team."}, {"userName": "matteo", "userReviewDate": "Mar 22, 2007", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/20493-matteo", "userReview": "I have to start this off by saying that I hate the Los Angeles Dodgers baseball team. And, by association, their Brooklyn ancestors. But the history of the team in Brooklyn, the stories from before the westward migration of the Giants and Dodgers in the 50s, the legends of the New York baseball teams in the Bronx, Manhattan, and Brooklyn... you can't love baseball and not love everything about this book. The first half, about growing up blocks away from Ebbets Field and the Dodgers, and being a beat reporter for the team, is fascinating. The second half, when the author visits retired members of the team and front office all over the country, is stirring. Except for famous players who stay in the spotlight, the public doesn't usually see what happens to baseball players after baseball. This book, which was originally published in the early 70s and set in a time that ranged from the mid-30s to late 60s, shows an assortment of talented players dealing with segregation, war, geography, money, and age. It gives a glimpse of baseball back when it was actually the people's game, and it shows a human side of the players."}, {"userName": "Louise Turner", "userReviewDate": "Jun 22, 2013", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/2598149-louise-turner", "userReview": "Seeing the movie \"42\" reminded me of this book I had read long ago. It covers the Brooklyn Dodgers team of the '52 &'53 seasons, a few years after Jackie Robinson broke the major league color barrier. Although the Dodgers made it to the World Series both these years they lost to the Yankees both times, causing their heartbroken fans to \"Wait until next year\" once more. Still this was one of the truly great teams, with four members--Jackie Robinson, Roy Campanella, PeeWee Reese, and Duke Snider--later chosen for the Baseball Hall of Fame. More than just a history of the accomplishments of the team, however, the second portion of the book gives an interesting and often touching look at what happened to these men after the glory days were over. I am also reminded of a book for young readers about this team, \"Teammates\" by Peter Golenbeck. It tells of the support Pee Wee Reese, the shortstop and captain of the team, gave to Jackie Robinson during that first year covered in \"42\". Both these men were outstanding players, with inner strength and integrity. True heroes, both of them."}, {"userName": "Garrett Cash", "userReviewDate": "May 04, 2013", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/7701118-garrett-cash", "userReview": "Too maudlin to take seriously, and focusing on aspects I did not care about, The Boys of Summer (despite being considered one of the greatest sports books of all time) is sorely disappointing. I wished it were better. One hundred pages is taken up recounting the authors growing up in Brooklyn. The next one hundred pages detail his covering the Dodgers, and the last two hundred fifty are a series of extremely similar, dull interviews with all of the players about sixteen years after they played on the team. The book assumes you already are familiar with the Dodgers. I was hoping for a book more about the struggles of the 50's Dodgers and the impact of the leave for LA. What I got instead was an amazingly lethargic, dense 450 pages of stuff I just didn't really care about. It's immensely depressing, Kahn focuses more on what tragedies happened to whom than the game. Overall, objectively I would say it's a good book, but it's not what I was looking for or hoped for.

This is the team of Jackie Robinson, Duke Snider, Roy Campanella, Gil Hodges, and Joe Black, among others. Today, Robinson is often portrayed in a safely beatific light, but he was fierce, coarse, and brilliant, and a \"troublemaker\" from childhood. My admiration of him is full to overflowing, as is my admiration for team captain Pee Wee Reese. Roy Campanella, the Dodgers black catcher, was signed by the Dodgers not long after Robinson and he was inducted into the Hall of Fame in 1969. Sadly, he was paralyzed in an automobile accident in 1958. I love how Kahn ends his description of a visit to Campy's house: \"He pushed the lever and the wheelchair started off bearing the broken body and leaving me, and perhaps Roxie Campanella as well, to marvel at the vaulting human spirit, imprisoned yet free, in the noble wreckage of the athlete, in the dazzling palace of the man.\"What is a practical way I can root for a team that played sixty years ago?"}, {"userName": "Milan Homola", "userReviewDate": "Aug 26, 2013", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/5943854-milan-homola", "userReview": "Two ball players, dressed in identical uniforms, stand next to each other.
