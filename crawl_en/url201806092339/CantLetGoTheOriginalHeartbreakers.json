I have loved this series from the first book and have even managed to keep up with the new releases. This is one of those books where you just want to highlight every other sentence. Now I have the daunting task of choosing just a couple of those quotes to entice you to read this book. Ryanne Wade is the owner of the bar, The Hitching Post. She inherited the bar from her former step father and she tries to honor his memory by running the bar as best she can. Ryanne lives life with a smile on her face and an attitude to match. You wouldn\u2019t know it that her growing up wasn\u2019t the best. Her mother paraded one husband or boyfriend after another through her life. Ryanne has promised herself she would never be like her mother which is why she is still a virgin. She may act like she is flirting but in reality, she is just trying to make every customer feel good about themselves. But then Ryanne met Jude Laurent, the brooding man whose life was filled with pain, most of which was on the inside. Somehow Jude became the biggest focus of her life. She simply couldn\u2019t get him off her mind. And then she realized that Jude was going to be the one, whether he knew it or not.\n\u201cJude was the one, she decided. The man who would break her amorous fast. He was the only guy her body craved. The only male her mind trusted.\u201d\nJude, along with his two best friends, Brock and Daniel, was a former army ranger and still suffered from PTSD. He and his two friends owned LPH Protection, which was a security firm. Jude lost half of his leg while he was deployed but after returning home to heal, he also lost his wife and twin daughters to a drunk driver. Now his life was all about pain. It had been two and a half years since he lost his family. He still grieved every day. So what was it about the bartender, Ryanne, that got on his nerves so much? Why did he let her get under his skin? It was disloyal to the memory of his wife to let his thoughts stray the way they have been, wasn\u2019t it? Right across from Ryanne\u2019s bar, a mob boss, Martin Dushku, was building a strip joint, and wanted to buy Ryanne\u2019s bar. Every other town that Dushku had businesses in, if people didn\u2019t sell to him, accidents started to happen and people got hurt or were killed. Now he wants Ryanne\u2019s bar. There is no way she is giving in to him. It isn\u2019t long before things start to happen. Jude is right there to amp up security in the bar and to protect her, even if it will put him closer to her and make the temptation worse. Ryanne continues to break down Jude\u2019s defenses. One night leads to more and then more isn\u2019t even enough. Jude craves Ryanne like he craves his next breath. But what if something were to happen to her, what if he loses her too? Jude fights the overwhelming need to lock Ryanne up to keep her safe, so he won\u2019t have to worry about her safety.\n\u201cWith you, I don\u2019t feel like a man defeated by his past. I feel like a man with a future.\u201d\nThe danger from Dushku increases and the pressure on Jude to keep her safe. He is driving Ryanne crazy and he could possibly lose her from being too over protective. \n\u201cEvery day, in a thousand different ways, you undo me, love. You\u2019re my world. You are the key to my shackles. You set me free.\u201d\nThis book made me sigh, swoon, smile, and gasp. I loved every single page of it. Jude was so broken and Ryanne only saw the beauty of him. Together they were perfection. As they fought the evil of Dushku, Ryanne fought to help Jude to heal. I so hope you\u2019ll give this book a try. Or start at the beginning of the series. Every book has been amazing. I can\u2019t wait for the next book, Can\u2019t Get Enough, which will be Brock and Lyndie\u2019s story."}, {"userName": "Patty Belongs To Kellan~Jesse~Lautner~Miller~Jack~Racer~Rafe~Liam~Prince Nicholas~Hayes~Simon~Gianluca & Archer", "userReviewDate": "Oct 27, 2017", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/14302918-patty-belongs-to-kellan-jesse-lautner-miller-jack-racer-rafe-liam-prince", "userReview": "*****FOUR STARS*****{Netgalley ARC}\n\u201dBeing without you has been the worst kind of hell. With you, I don\u2019t feel like a man defeated by his past. I feel like a man with a future.\u201d\nCAN\u2019T LET GO is an enemies to lovers romance between a broken Hero and a feisty Heroine. I was intrigued by the couple while reading the previous book and I knew that their story was going to be one I could not pass up. Jude and Ryanne have incredible chemistry and whenever they\u2019re in each other\u2019s presence, you can feel the tension building. It was inevitable that they\u2019d be giving into their passion and let me just say it was INSANELY HOT! I was not in the least bit disappointed!Ryanne Wade owns the local bar in Strawberry Valley. She has had to deal with a lot of judgment and harsh criticism from some of the town folk throughout her years because of her mother\u2019s tarnished reputation. Ryanne has made it her life\u2019s purpose to be nothing like her mother and that ended up with her love life being non-existent. But there\u2019s one man who gets her insides burning and also ignites her temper, and that\u2019s the sexy as hell, ex-army ranger, Jude Laurent, who spends most of his time scowling and throwing insults at her.Jude has suffered loss that would have obliterated most. A drunk driver destroyed his life one stormy night when he decided he was ok to get behind the wheel and ended up killing his wife and little twin daughters. Jude is but a mere shell of the man he used to be. He is plagued by his grief and unimaginable guilt he still feels over the deaths of his family. It\u2019s been two and a half years since they passed and he has never had the desire to move on or to get romantically involved with another woman, but Ryanne has stirred something inside of him and he\u2019s overwhelmed by his feelings that he\u2019s not at all ready to face.When a shady businessman decides to open up a nightclub across from Ryanne\u2019s bar and he soon wreaks havoc on her life and livelihood, Jude jumps in to handle the security of her bar and also designates himself her personal bodyguard. This delights Ryanne since she can\u2019t help but admit that she is extremely attracted to Jude but he\u2019s as cold as ice and seems almost impervious to her charms. With each passing day, Jude is finding it hard to fight his attraction towards Ryanne and when they finally let go of their fears and give in to their feelings, they both agree that it will be a one-time thing. Once they\u2019ve had a taste, neither of them are satisfied with the one and done scenario.Ryanne has dreamed of traveling abroad almost her entire life and has a month long trip to Italy already paid for. So the two agree to continue their heated affair until she leaves for Italy in a few months. Will they be able to let each other go when their temporary relationship has met its expiration date? Can Ryanne break through all of Jude\u2019s defense mechanisms and ultimately own a piece of his heart?Here are my overall ratings on the book:\nHeroes:\n 4\nHeroine:\n 4\nPlot:\n 4\nAngst:\n4\nSteam:\n 5\nChemistry Between Hero & Heroine:\n 5CAN\u2019T LET GO releases on October 31st!Amazon: http://amzn.to/2xD3RI1Kindle: http://amzn.to/2ym7aXRBarnes: http://tinyurl.com/ycht2t2kBAM: http://tinyurl.com/y848w3ae"}, {"userName": "Laura", "userReviewDate": "Oct 27, 2017", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/8429172-laura", "userReview": "[Ryanne getting pregnant and Jude\u2019s until-we-are-married-there\u2019s-no-sex rule.

With the right pace and some twists readers should be happy campers.Sadly this book did not wowed me like Can't Hardly Breathe.Maybe because my expectations diving in were very high or maybe because I just had finished one of my best reads of 2017 or maybe...If Ryanne is a great female character with spunk, sass and a big heart she did not moved me like Daisy did. It is unfair to compare both women but my head constantly came back to Daisy\u2026 Daisy's evolution and empowerment were fabulous elements in Can't Hardly Breathe. Ryanne certainly evolved in this story but she had not a long way to go like Daisy had. What I really liked about Ryanne was her independence and confidence. She is sexy, caring and very determined.Jude on the other hand shot down their relationship repeatedly and made mistakes upon mistakes. To the point that I wanted to be done with him. Truly he grated on my nerves.Objectively I knew he had a traumatic past and reasons to grieve but reading about someone wallowing in grief is never pleasant. I knew he was a gifted soldier. I read that he was handsome etc. But all these qualities were lost on me when I saw him repeatedly sabotaging his future.That being said the plot was built carefully with a villain wanting to take Ryanne's bar with force and violence if necessary. Reading about Daisy and Danielle, Brock and Lyndi as well as Ryanne's mother Selma warmed my heart.So all in all it was an enjoyable read mainly thanks to Ryanne but not an exceptional read for me.My taste is no universal law so what prevented me from truly loving my read might be what you are looking for in a story.

Pretty much all the same grievances I had in the other Heartbreakers books happened here. Top to bottom. Links to my reviews are below:The Closer You ComeThe Hotter You BurnThe Harder You FallCan't Hardly BreatheThe writing once again is incoherent rambling gibberish that makes no sense. \nWhy had he stopped fighting for her? Because winning her would be hard, if not impossible? So the hell what. Because they wanted different things? Did he even know what he wanted? Stop trying and start failing.Actually, stop doing and start failing. Trying never did shit for anyone, except give the trier a thousand excuses to do a piss poor job. If Jude continued doing--fighting-he risked getting hurt again. So. The hell. What. He was hurting regardless. What did he have to lose?\nRyanne and Jude were ok. But the writing did not serve any purpose towards fleshing these two out beyond comical gimmicky caricatures. \nOne second Jude stood in place, perhaps the picture of calm, the next he erupted, punching the wall again and again, his fist pummeling at rapid fire.Wood crushed beneath the force. Splinters rained. A thick cloud of plaster formed around him. He didn't care. Today he'd stalked Ryanne, a predator tormented by his past. Of course she wanted to take a break from him. He wanted to take a break from himself!\nI don\u2019t know, I like my alpha heroes to be a little less Wreck it Ralph and a tad more substantial. If this was a Paranormal story I would let this kind of \u2018macho fists makes plaster fly\u2019 thing go. But in a Contemporary book? Get real. I literally kept picturing Jude as some character from a video game. Doesn't work for me. Neither is \u201clet me shadow your every step to protect you\u201d moves. I needed more substance. For Jude especially. For a still grieving widower he had no business acting the way he did in here and so quickly. This guy is a far cry and poor imitation of Lucien from LOTU. And Ryanne is another heroine who fell victim to this author's extremely hamfisted wacky attempts at contrived angst in the form of irrational dramatic bunny-boiling adolescent behavior. To have a full grown woman screaming and crying the house down over some imaginary \"betrayal\" about a simple smile when all these two did--up till this point--was bump uglies 2 times in the span of a few days is fucking nuts. Not a good look Ryanne. (And PS Gena: This is not normal or rootable behavior of any kind, angst or no angst, knock it off with this obnoxious nonsense.)And of course, the cheese factor. The layers of cheese in this book is so thick you can gag on it. \n\"Do you still feel like you're broken?\" she asked, petting his chest.\"After you picked up my pieces and put me back together again? Not even a little.\"Darling, romantic man....\"Are you happy?\"\"Ecstatically so. And you?\"\"Magnificently so.\" She wasn't just happy, she was gloriously satisfied. Amazingly content.....\"You won me, body and soul.\"\"As you've won me. You shattered my resistance, frayed my control and flooded light into my darkness. You are the key to my shackles. You set me free.\"\nWho the hell talks this way? I'd really like to know cause this is on a new level of Unicorn unrealness. Everything about this book, this whole series in fact, felt very labored. As if Gena is shoving everything that pops into her head on paper and crams it all together not caring if nothing makes sense or adds anything to the story or characters. That feeling of frustration and complete dissatisfaction has become a recurring theme with all of Showalter\u2019s work for me, no matter the genre. At this point yes I still want to read Brock & Lyndie's story but I\u2019m not expecting anything worthwhile or amazing. Only reason I read this one besides the Lucien comparison was to get to Brock's story. Call me a masochist, whatever, I just want to see payoff of some kind considering the word \"payoff\" is not in Mrs. Showalter's vocabulary. Ask William the Ever Randy. Buuuut that's another rant for another review. And FYI I did not buy this book, it was a library borrow. And I encourage others to save their money and go to their local libraries instead with problematic authors who don't understand the meaning of reader loyalty and burning bridges. \u263a\ufe0fBrock's book will also be a borrow as well, if I can get it from a library that is. If not, c\u00e9 la vie. I\u2019m just beyond ready to wash my hands completely of Gena Showalter."}, {"userName": "\u24b6lleskelle - teamS\u00f8ren\u2657 \u22b2I like big b00ks\u22b3", "userReviewDate": "Oct 27, 2017", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/18387313-lleskelle---teams-ren-i-like-big-b00ks", "userReview": "DNF @26%Do real people really talk like this?

It's such a fun, sexy, entertaining and emotional read, I loved it. The story is about Ryanne, a feisty twenty-five year old woman, owner of a bar called the Scratching Post, who dreams of traveling the world and Jude, co-owner of a security firm called LPH Protection, a man who's still mourning the loss of his family, a born protector, sexy as hell and stubborn to a fault. I absolutely loved them together and individually. The first time Gena described Jude, I was done for. Sold. I wanted more.\nTonight, he was a bona fide brawler, ready to throw down and heat women up. He wore a black T-shirt, ripped jeans and combat boots. Leather cuffs circled his wrists, and three silver rings glinted on his fingers.\nHmmmm, yes! Give him to me! Jude isn't a man who's ready to love again or to be with a woman period. Ryanne decides to put a stop to her ban on romantic relationships and she wants him. I thought the way she went about flirting with him was hilarious. She had no filter and no shame, I loved that. It was actually refreshing to see a heroine so bold and confident without being overly annoying. Ryanne is in need of protection after a very bad man threatens her bar, her home. So, obviously, Jude steps in and offers to protect her...Gena didn't make us wait too long for them to act on their needs but it wasn't an easy relationship. I think she did a great job. It wasn't too slow for my taste, I got what I wanted throughout the book, but it wasn't too fast either. She didn't rush them together, Gena took her time exploring their relationship, their feelings, their fears. Jude broke my heart more than once, his situation is heartbreaking, I can't even imagine. Losing your wife and twin daughters all in one night. Gena handled that very smoothly as well, it's always a delicate situation in a book and she did a great job. Overall, this was a great read, super steamy, it made me genuinely laugh and left me wanting more."}, {"userName": "Marta Cox", "userReviewDate": "Oct 17, 2017", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/14378267-marta-cox", "userReview": "Hands up I'm not the biggest fan of contemporary romance around but I've loved this authors paranormal stories ( particularly her earlier work ) so couldn't resist downloading this. Yes it's part of a series but that didn't prevent me understanding and enjoying this book. Essentially it's a story of two people who have given up on love and yet both feel a powerful attraction to each other. Ryanne has no place in her life for a man and truthfully has yet to meet one who she can really trust. Feeling let down by her mother she's now running her late step fathers bar but Ryanne dreams of traveling the world and experiencing all it has to offer. Meantime though she's determined to seduce the grumpy widower Jude as he might scowl at her but his disapproval seems to be just skin deep.Jude has lost so much, his wife, his children and even a limb and yet somehow he keeps going on. What he doesn't want is Ryanne giving him her come hither innuendos . Yet this fiesty female is waking up all kind of feelings in Jude, feelings he is determined to tamp down and ignore. Trouble is knock knock knocking on Ryannes door though and there's no way Jude will look the other way but darn it Ryanne just might have woken up the sleeping tiger!This is seemingly a relationship full of pitfalls. Ryanne runs a bar selling alcohol and Jude has so much anger as he lost his family due to a drunk driver. His disapproval and grief see him firmly dismissing Ryannes advances but as a reader I couldn't help but smile. Actually I even laughed a few times as Ryanne sure does have a very firm grasp on flirting with danger! This isn't a quick happy ever after no, it's a relationship that slowly builds as the couple push each other's buttons and their dialogue and banter really made this a fun, engaging read. Expect sexy times but for me it was the unexpected that truly kept me turning the pages. Yes there's an element of suspense, yes there are problems to overcome but most of all it's a romance that made me smile.

I honestly loved the previous books so much so I was curious to see how this book would match up with the rest of the books in the series. And I would say FABULOUS!!! There was something so endearing about this book that felt different from the previous books. I think what made the biggest impression was their chemistry. Because its like off the charts but there are other factors involved that keep them from just entering into a relationship smoothly.So our hero, Jude Laurent, is suffering some emotional trauma. His wife and two daughters were killed in a car accident while he was injured and lost his leg. So its been a couple of years later and it still haunts him.Loved ones left marks on your soul, and when they died, those marks became scars.\nHe is full on against anyone drinking alcohol and so he so doesn't approve of Ryanne running a bar. He is this haunted brooding male that doesn't approve of anything Ryanne does and always looks for the bad before the good. Our heroine isn't ashamed of what she does and she is so careful in making sure no one goes home drunk and she is sassy, independent and strong. I love how she pushes Jude's boundaries.If you didn't take time to enjoy your life, to make others happy rather miserable, did you have a life worth living?\nThere is a big obstacle though, Jude's fear. His fear of the past and not wanting it to effect what he has with Ryanne causes some not so good tension. So we see our hero really deal with some real hard fears that he has to learn to overcome if he doesn't want to lose Ryanne. There is so many various feels that Gena Showalter implements in this story and worked me more than I thought it would. This story did crack me up though, Showalter is one of those authors that makes you laugh and grin when you don't expect it to.Can't Let Go is a story that delves into in depth emotion, rollercoaster of laughs and tears and a sexy small town tale any romance reader will be bound to love.[foogallery id=\"18238\"]"}, {"userName": "Tpagirl", "userReviewDate": "Dec 09, 2017", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/50693314-tpagirl", "userReview": "Can\u2019t Let Go was Gena Showalter\u2019s fifth book in the Original Heartbreakers series.Jude Laurent and Ryanne Wade were introduced in the previous book, Can\u2019t Hardly Breathe, with Daniel and Dorothea. They have chemistry but to this point, it was primarily angry tension.Jude was one of the surly and gorgeous, former military co-owners of LPH Protection, a company that specialized in security protection. We had learned previously that tragedy struck in the form of a drunk driver killing his wife and twin daughters. Jude was now the ghost of a man he used to be, like the walking dead, and was a self appointed drink police for not letting drunks get behind the wheel. Ryanne was the owner of the local bar, The Scratching Post. She had a tough childhood and now embraced life to the fullest. She was beautiful, flirty and sexy but kept men at bay, never wanting to rely on one. She was strong and independent and welcomed living life solo, trying in no one but herself and her besties.Can\u2019t Let Go was a journey of healing, trust, hope and moving on mixed with a plot of mystery and corruption. Lastly, Showalter sprinkled in bonds of loyalty. It was emotional but was also well written, well developed and complex.As always, I enjoyed the storyline and the characters. The next book, Can\u2019t Get Enough, focuses on the last of the former military buddies, Brock.

The story line was good but so predictable. The hero was grieving his wife and twins throughout the majority of the book so that takes away from the story. Then after he gives into his feelings for Ryanne (which I kept pronouncing as \"Rain\" in my head. No idea why) he still lets fear override his feelings for her.It was a decent enough read but with such ridiculous writing. All of the sexual euphemisms using car analogy's for sex and stuff was eye roll inducing. It was just hard to take those scenes seriously or think them sexy.Really, I don't have much to say for this review. Not gonna gush on the story just because it was ok for me.

Her father wishing she were never born and her mother jumping from one man to another, including Ryannes\u2019 boyfriends. Running a bar is hard when you have a grumpy solider breathing down her neck. Learning to trust him and allow him to provide the protection she needs when her competition moves in just across the street. Jude has made it his mission to guard the city from any demons. His life was turned upside down in such a tragic way; he hasn\u2019t been living for quite some time now. Watching Ryannes\u2019 customers and regular is second nature to him. When he notices a new business start up shop next to Ryanne\u2019s, his head begins to spin, something bad to going to happen. Unable to watch it happen he provides protect for her, losing his heart in the process. Jude and Ryanne have a very tumultuous relationship, neither one wanting to give an inch. Intense in every way from fighting to loving, Jude and Ryanne were intense. Together they spend so much time fighting each other; it sometimes felt as if they were going in circles, fighting over the same things. As a couple I found them exhausting to keep up with. I did enjoy seeing how the close friends were able to help clear up some blurred lines between the couple and keep everyone grounded. The secondary characters were the ones that kept peaking my interest. The trouble that brewed between the competitor and Ryanne added a suspense twist to the story that kept the pages turning. The emotions were all over the place, from wanting to shake Jude and Ryanne, worried they wouldn\u2019t figure it out, and relief they finally did. This is my first time reading Gena Showalters\u2019 work, I can say this was not a couple I would read again, but I would not pass up a chance to read more of her work. Oh, wow. Was Can\u2019t Let Go a wonderful story! I truly loved the storyline and how everything progressed between Ryanne and Jude. Ryanne was hysterical. She knew just what to say to keep the gloomy Jude. Yes, he has a right to feel the way he feels about his life but there is no reason why she can\u2019t try to put a smile on his face and maybe a little happy in his life. She lived with her own issues growing up and it take a lot for her to trust a man. But, Jude has her trust and she is doing whatever it takes to get him to accept it and her in his life.Jude was distraught. He\u2019s lived with the misery of losing his wife and twin daughters for two and a half years and can\u2019t stand the feelings he\u2019s starting to have for the flirty, vivacious Ryanne. All he can think about is Strawberry Shortcake when he\u2019s around her and, of course, protecting her from Dushku. He can understand the protection part, he can\u2019t get past his wanting her the way he does. He can\u2019t tarnish the memory of Caroline and will never have children again. He could never live through losing someone he loves again.Once Jude has a taste of Ryanne, he can\u2019t stop. Unfortunately, he\u2019s running hot and cold and Ryanne will not stand for that. It\u2019s time for him to put his past to bed and look forward to the future. But, can he get over his fears? Can he allow himself to love again? Can he accept Ryanne and everything that she has to offer? It takes his in-laws and the support from his friends to get him to see what is staring him in the face.I love Gena Showalter. I love how she can lighten up a tense and serious scene. I love how she weaves a story. I love how she brings out the true feelings of her characters. Ryanne was written beautifully and she was the star of the show. Jude was intense and, in his own way, loving \u2013 even when he didn\u2019t think he was showing love. I giggled as Ms. Showalter brought the Lords of the Underworld into the story and how she did it.It was wonderful being back in Strawberry Hill \u2026 visiting with Daniel and Dorthea \u2026 waiting for Brock and Lyndie\u2019s story."}, {"userName": "Lacey (Booklovers For Life)", "userReviewDate": "Oct 29, 2017", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/9303686-lacey-booklovers-for-life", "userReview": "Thanks to the publisher for generously providing me an ARC to review."}, {"userName": "Kayla", "userReviewDate": "Sep 16, 2017", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/11339363-kayla", "userReview": "Gena Showalter knocked it out of the emotional ballpark with Can't Let Go! It has been, by far, my favorite of the Original Heartbreakers Series. Jude is the most addictive male role to date in the series (at least for me he was!) and I adored Ryanne's spunk, independent, take no crap attitude. It's hard to find lead female characters that do not annoy me at least once throughout a novel. Ryanne's constant sexual banter back and forth with Jude was absolute perfection. She was the one flame that was able to melt the ice surrounding his tattered heart. They had amazing chemistry that basically slid right off of the pages. The plot is fast paced with never a dull-moment. The entire cast in this series are so well-crafted that I feel like I could jump in my car, drive to this Strawberry lovin' small town, and pop in Ryanne's bar for a drink with these folks. I live in a small town but this world that Gena Showalter has crafted makes me green with envy! Everyone is so close but not of the nosey variety (mostly anyways ha). One of my favorite Jude moments: \"Every day, in a thousand different ways, you undo me, love. You're my world.\" Take a moment... swoon.... Who knew Jude, the ice-cold, stone hearted, bitter soldier could rock my literary world with words? He's amazing. Overall, huge 5 Star read for me. Loved it!

I read this last week on vacation and it was the PERFECT book to get lost in. The Original Heartbreakers series is one of my favorite contemporary romance series and The Hotter You Burn has held the spot as my favorite in the series but Can't Let Go has me questioning that decision. Ryanne runs the local bar and Jude's family was killed when someone drove drunk after leaving a bar. So you can imagine how hard it is when these two are attracted to each other. Jude is at times mean and difficult but still I couldn't dislike him. Ryanne is hilarious and an indiscriminate flirt. I adored every second she was in. Add in a rival bar owner willing to go to any length to drive Ryanne out of business and you have a book full of everything I could want. Angst, sex, humor, action, and my absolute favorite cast of characters.

I\u2019ve been devouring the audio books one after another falling in love with the town, the characters, and the stories. But this one was disappointing. The only reason I finished this book was; because of the narrator Savannah Richards. Her voice is like a lure and she captured me even though I was so perturbed with everything that happened. If I had had the actual book in my hand I would\u2019ve thrown it into the sea.I feel like I read something totally different then everyone else and so with that, I\u2019m going to be ranting. You have been warned.We have Ryanne who is an independent strong women. She knows what she wants and yet she lets Jude into her life even after he emotionally hurts her over and over again. One time I can see forgiving, but multiple times no way. Then we have Jude a former Army Ranger who is suffering from PTSD and the death of his family, wife and twin daughters. I wanted to like both characters, but I ended up yelling at them and rolling my eyes. Jude comes off as a prick and Ryanne well she is kinda cool, so I didn\u2019t dislike her, but was upset with how she had goals, new her mind, yet she changed them and accepted Jude. She did try to get him to live again, she gave her all into getting him out of his funk, but he gave nothing or as little as possible. It was sad to see this type of relationship.Their romance wasn\u2019t a romance. It was teenage hormonal lust. My god they sleep together, only because they can\u2019t resit the attraction anymore. Jude doesn\u2019t like her as a person or what she represents. The author tried to label their romance and she mentioned it as friends with benefits, but it wasn\u2019t even that. It\u2019s teenage lust... They didn\u2019t even date. Didn\u2019t do the little get to know you things people do. It was sexual tension and sex. Nothing more. As for the sex well it\u2019s scorching hot and the sexual tension was of the charts, but you can\u2019t have a relationship based on that alone. I was also so upset with how Jude treated Ryanne. I was upset that she kept letting him back into her life. Why did she give her verginity to this man? Ya, he\u2019s sexy as sin, but he doesn\u2019t respect her as a person. As for their first time and her first time having sex, she goes on and on as to how it was the best sex of her life. Well duh, you haven\u2019t been with anyone else. Another thing that upset me was when Jude got a vasectomy, it\u2019s a big life altering decision that would affect his future. He did this at the begging of the book all so he could sleep with Ryanne without fear of having kids anymore. He want\u2019s to get her out of his system. He\u2019s afraid and doesn\u2019t battle his fears. He lets them rule his decisions. Well the joke was on him in the end. Their little get-together even though they still used a condom and she\u2019s on the pill; which it should have been imposable, made the imposable. Last. Marriage.  He didn\u2019t ask; because he loves her, not for the company, not because he cares about her in anyway, only because of the baby does he ask. He can\u2019t even talk or say the word baby. Neither one has said I LOVE YOU. Such a frustrating moment. Ahhh\u2026.These two shouldn\u2019t have been together. I rolled my eyes so much. I got frustrated a lot. I just can\u2019t rave about this book, because it had to many button pushing issues for me. The only thing I liked was the little bit of conflict with the mob boss who causes trouble at Ryanne\u2019s bar.Unfortunately, Can\u2019t Let Go was not the book for me. If the blurb intrigues you, I urge you to give it a shot. Just because it did not work for me does not mean it won\u2019t for you.\u00a0Audio: Savannah Richards continues to amaze me. Even though I disliked this book I adored the audio. Her voice is a lure and enchanting. She brings the characters to life. I highly recommend the audiobooks for The Original Heartbreakers series.

A perfect life, married and had two beautiful children. Until one night changed everything. He is dead inside, breathing but not living. Until he meets Ryanne. Ryanne makes it her life's mission to make Jude happy again, but doesn't expect to fall in love with him. She pushes and he pulls, and the end result....... INTENSE, PASSIONATE, CHEMISTRY. The tension between these two were damn near combustible. Gena Showalter reminds us the readers, that love is a fragile little thing. Built from pain, loss, but most of all hope.

It\u2019s one of life\u2019s greatest mysteries.\u201dJude Laurent survived a negligent childhood and a war-torn battlefield only to lose it all when his family was killed in a car accident. After his discharge from the military, his best friend Daniel Porter convinces Jude and their buddy Brock to come home with him to Strawberry Valley, Oklahoma and to start their security business. Jude is a walking time bomb-barely living as he can\u2019t get past the guilt and anger over his losses. Only one woman tempts him to rise from the depths of his despair and that is the one woman whose choice of employment offends him.Ryanne Wade is just trying to make an honest living. Having inherited her bar from her stepfather, she just wants to preserve his memory while saving up for her trip around the world. Having sworn off men, Ryanne finds herself willing to break her vow of celibacy with the sexy and oh so emotionally unavailable Judd.When Ryanne and her business is threatened by a local mob boss, Judd snaps to attention vowing to protect her at all costs. But when their hearts get involved, he\u2019ll have to learn to let her go if he wants to keep her.I am a sucker for antagonistic romances and this one certainly delivers on that note even if only one \u00bd of this couple is antagonistic and the other half is just plain determined. Can\u2019t Let Go is the fifth in Showalter\u2019s contemporary romance series-The Original Heartbreakers. Set in the neighboring town of Blueberry Hill (I always get hungry reading this series), Showalter once again gifts readers with an emotional, humorous, and sensual romance built on love, loss, hope, and second chances when a damaged war veteran and widower reluctantly falls for a beautiful bartender. Delightful antagonistic chemistry spits and sparks as Showalter slowly builds this couple\u2019s relationship. A dash of suspense adds some zing to the story.Jude and Ryanne\u2019s journey is an emotional one as their growing attraction to one another forces them to face their fears head-on and exorcise the ghosts around them. Both are stuck in the past though Ryanne is able to compartmentalize her feelings far better than Jude. An external force provides a bit of suspense and pushes them together. I enjoyed their interactions once they call a truce. Ryanne loves to poke the tiger and you can\u2019t help but laugh as she flirts and teases Jude to distraction.Day one was all about the hair flip. Slow, sensual and just like a shampoo commercial.Day two, she practiced her shimmy. Any time she had an opportunity to shake her butt, she shook her freaking butt. Day three, she focused on her cleavage. Or rather, she made certain Jude focused on her cleavage. She wore a low-cut top, her breasts pushed up until she was pretty sure she\u2019d asphyxiate. Day four, she put her finger to her mouth at every opportunity. A lick here, a nibble there. Day five, she forgot to wear a bra. Oops! [\u2026] For day six, she decided to up her game, and wore a short skirt but no panties. Walking to her office, when no one else stood in the hallway, she accidentally dropped a pen and bent down to pick it up. Her phone buzzed, but she didn\u2019t check the text until she sat behind her desk, no cameras nearby.Cowboy: I think you dropped something else.A laugh bubbled from her. Grumpy Jude Laurent had just teased her sexually!Showalter takes her time with their romance, moving slowly but with a purpose, though they engage in a sexual relationship rather easily on. Readers need to remember their foreplay started a book or two ago. The chemistry between them is hot and heavy with lust and tension-made more so by Jude\u2019s reluctance. The witty banter between these two contrasts perfectly with the serious subject matter and thick emotional undertones.\u2018Had anyone loved life with such abandon? Part of him hated her for that.\u2019A strong and personable cast of secondary characters (some new and some very familiar faces) provide Jude and Ryanne with a strong support system at their back with humor and compassion. From their besties to family, to the local bar patrons, Jude and Ryanne are blessed or cursed with a number of people who want them both to be happy. They aren\u2019t offered instant solutions but rather plenty of advice, opinions, a few metaphorical shakes, and a shoulder or two to cry on.\u201cVery subtle, Mr. Porter [\u2026] but I\u2019m on to your tricks.\u201d\u201cI told you to call me Virgil, son. And FYI, I have no tricks. I just wish you\u2019d use your outside voice so we could hear your conversations better.\u201dWe learn more about Jude\u2019s deceased wife and Judd\u2019s life with her. I liked that Showalter doesn\u2019t make her a villain or a saint in order to create even more conflict.I did have some issues with the romance. Some obviously manufactured conflicts and miscommunication litters storyline as did the HUGE MASSIVE foreshadowing that pretty much told you what would happen-just not how. The two steps forward and 5 steps back dance because of Jude\u2019s internal struggles becomes a wee bit monotonous as time passes while Ryanne\u2019s occasional emotional grandstanding annoys. I also took issue with Ryanne\u2019s description of Jude\u2019s penis.The ending comes as no surprise with our couple jumping their relationship hurdles, defeating the bad guys, and looking positively towards their future.The resolution of the main conflict wraps up the story nicely and helps to pave the way for book six-Can\u2019t Get Enough-set to release December 5, 2017."}], "description": "New York Times bestselling author Gena Showalter is back with a sizzling Original Heartbreakers tale about an icy war vet and the only woman capable of melting him\u2026With trust issues a mile long, Ryanne Wade has sworn off men.\u00a0 Then Jude Laurent walks into her bar and all bets are off.\u00a0 The former Army Ranger has suffered unimaginably, first being maimed in battle then losing his wife and daughters to a drunk driver.
