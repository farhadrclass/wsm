I was wrong.\u201d\nWhatever you do, do NOT read this book at work unless you want to be thought insane for bursting into laughter. Like all of the books in this series, this story is utterly adorable. Never has a tale starting in blackmail been so romantic.Yeah, you heard me. Romantic. Blackmail. I solemnly proclaim myself sane, with a fierce hatred for assholes. The love interest in this book blackmails the heroine into marriage. I know that's a bad start for any tale, but believe me when I say that this story was so good. I assure you there is no abuse. I assure you that the love interest and his motives are noble (if questionable...I mean, it's still blackmail.) I am not a fan of assholes. I assure you, you will love this book.16-year old Maddie is dreadfully shy. She has a stepmother that she wishes were an evil stepmother. Instead, lovely Anne wants to dress Maddie up and give her a season so Maddie can find her One Twoo Wuv.An absolutely horrifying thought.Maddie has what we would call today Social Anxiety Disorder. She is terrified of crowds. She is quite accomplished as an amateur artist, happiest in her own company, sketching nature...like the mating rituals of a pair of lobsters, lovingly named Fluffy and Rex. So in order to avoid coming out and facing people, Maddie invents an imaginary lover, Logan MacKenzie. A brave, brave soldier who has fallen in love with her at first sight.\nLogan MacKenzie. Suddenly her not-\u00adreal suitor had a name. By the end of the afternoon, he had hair (brown), eyes (blue), a voice (deep, with a Highland burr), a rank (captain), and a personality (firm, but intelligent and kind).\nShe writes letters to an imaginary lover and ships it off to god knows where. \nMy dear imaginary Captain MacKenzie, you are not real and never will be. I, however, am a true and eternal fool.Here, have a drawing of a snail.\nAfter 5 years, the guilt of constantly lying to her loved ones drew on her conscience, and thusly Maddie makes the sad decision of killing Captain Logan off. Nine years after her invention of Logan, 24-year old Maddie is living a happy life in an inherited Scottish castle when a zombie comes to the door. That is, Logan. What are the odds? The real Logan has been receiving and reading her letters all these years. The real Logan is nothing like what she imagined.\nHis hair was overlong (mostly brown, with hints of ginger), and his squared jaw sported several days\u2019 growth of whiskers (mostly ginger, with hints of brown). Broad shoulders tapered to a trim torso. A simple black sporran was slung low around his waist, and a sheathed dirk rode his hip. Below the fall of his kilt, muscled, hairy legs disappeared into white hose and scuffed black boots.\nHe's mad. He's Scottish. He's kilted. Was there ever a more terrifying combination? Logan didn't just show up for shits and giggles, he's got a mission in mind. Marriage to Maddie. He intends to take the castle and the lands surrounding it, lands so conveniently owned by Maddie. If she doesn't marry him, he will expose her letters, ridiculing her and her family. Maddie is unwilling to put herself and her family through that humiliation...and therefore agrees to a marriage of convenience.But, naturally, all is not what it seems. Come on, this is a romance novel. Logan is not a nefarious asshole. He has only recently returned from the war, scarred, broken, with his similarly battle-worn band of men. They have lost their lands due to their evil English landlords. Logan is determined to protect his men at all cost. He is their captain. They've been through so much together; it is his responsibility to take care of them.\nIt wasn\u2019t supposed to be this way. When the regiment had landed at Dover last autumn, they\u2019d been greeted as triumphant heroes in London. Then they\u2019d marched north. Home, to the Highlands. And he\u2019d watched his men\u2019s lives and dreams fall apart at the seams, one by one.Callum wasn\u2019t the only one. The men gathered around him represented the last of his discharged soldiers, and the worst off: the homeless, the wounded, the left behind.They\u2019d fought bravely, survived battle, won the war for England on the promise of coming home to their families and sweethearts\u2014\u00adonly to find their families, homes, and sweethearts gone. Pushed off the lands they\u2019d inhabited for centuries by the same greedy English landlords who\u2019d asked them to fight.And Logan couldn\u2019t do a damned thing about it. Until today.\nNaturally, attraction grows between them, and Logan discovers that Maddie is not the spoiled English heiress he'd expected. She is kind, caring, loving to her tenants. A brilliant artist. A thoroughly intelligent young woman with a crippling fear of crowds. Which isn't to say she doesn't have her oddities.\nMaddie had always been different from other girls, and she had always known it. For example, she was certain she was the only bride to ever write the following to-\u00addo list on her wedding day:\u2022\tBath\u2022\tCoiffure\u2022\tDress\u2022\tLobsters\nAnd Maddie realizes that---oddly enough, she now has a friend.\nA realization struck her like a lightning bolt. She now had a confidant. A conspirator. Someone who knew everything. All her secrets. He didn\u2019t love her for them, but he hadn\u2019t run screaming from her, either.This ruthless, kilted stranger she\u2019d married might be the closest thing on earth Maddie had to a true friend.\nMaddie is not without guile...she is not spineless, and if Logan expects her to play this charade, she will make him pay for it.Like making him read a love poem he allegedly wrote her.\n\u201cWere I a bird, I\u2019d sing for thee.Were I a bee, I\u2019d sting for thee.Were I a peak, I\u2019d tower for thee.Were I a tree, I\u2019d flower for thee.Were I a flute\u2014\u00ad\u201dThe reading was interrupted as Callum began to cough with alarming violence. Rabbie slapped him on the back with vigor.\u201cDo I need to stop?\u201d Logan asked. \u201cAre you dying?\u201dCallum shook his head.\u201cBecause I wouldna mind it if you were dying.\u201d\u201cNo, no.\u201d At length Callum looked up with a reddened face and choked out, \u201cDinna mind me. Do go on.\u201d\u201cWere I a flute, I\u2019d play for thee.Were I a steed, I\u2019d neigh for thee.\u201d\nAnd against her will, Maddie finds himself falling for the man behind that steely exterior.\nAnd now, despite all her best attempts to avoid it, here it came.Her heart started telling her a dangerous, dangerous tale. The story of a decent, loyal man who\u2019d treasured her letters, dreamed of her nightly, survived battles and marched across continents to come home\u2014\u00adnot to a castle or a glen but to her. And even now, when he held her in his arms, he lacked the words to explain all the emotion in his heart.It was nothing but a silly fiction.It had to be.\nAnd like a gentleman, Logan doesn't immediately attempt to consummate his marriage. He waits. And waits. And waits. He waits so long that he has to endure the teasing of his men---who see fit to give him some advice about seducing his wife.\nRabbie hunched over to whisper. \u201cShe\u2019s got to see him with his kit off. Shirt, plaid, all of it.\u201dA coarse whoop rose up from the men.\u201cNo, I mean it,\u201d Rabbie said, standing up. \u201cHere\u2019s how it goes. You rise early one morning, Captain. Choose a misty one, when the gloom\u2019s settled like a blanket over the valley.\u201dHe waved his flattened hand before them like an artist painting a landscape. \u201cYou strip down to your skin, and then you have a dip in the loch. Wait until she comes looking for you. Because she will. They always do. But pretend not to notice when she does. And then\u2014\u00adjust when she\u2019s close enough to see and she\u2019s been watching for a while, you rise up out of the water. Like a dolphin. Or a mermaid.

Faced with such crippling fear of crowds and her upcoming London debut, Maddie impulsively manufactures a fictional beau . . . a fictional beau of military rank who is valiantly conveniently away, fighting a war. Captain Logan MacKenzie. *swoons*Using her captain as a shield, she is able to avoid all social gatherings, but to maintain her falsehood's credibility, she must write letter after letter to her one true love. Letters she imagines sit abandoned, unopened in some tent on the war front housing undeliverable mail. (*snickers*)After FIVE long years, in an attempt to abandon the farce, she delivers to her family the terrible news that her poor Captain has died a hero's death. She mourns for a full year. Eventually, Maddie and her spinster aunt relocate to a Scottish castle left to her by her godfather that had been intended for her and Captain MacKenzie when they wed. YES. It went that far.

Completed review now posted..... When a Scot Ties the Knot is so fun, so romantic, so sexy... so much of what Tessa Dare fans love about her stories!Blurb...On the cusp of her first London season, Miss Madeline Gracechurch was shyly pretty and talented with a drawing pencil, but hopelessly awkward with gentlemen. She was certain to be a dismal failure on the London marriage mart. So Maddie did what generations of shy, awkward young ladies have done: she invented a sweetheart.A Scottish sweetheart. One who was handsome and honorable and devoted to her, but conveniently never around. Maddie poured her heart into writing the imaginary Captain MacKenzie letter after letter \u2026 and by pretending to be devastated when he was (not really) killed in battle, she managed to avoid the pressures of London society entirely.Until years later, when this kilted Highland lover of her imaginings shows up in the flesh. The real Captain Logan MacKenzie arrives on her doorstep\u2014handsome as anything, but not entirely honorable. He\u2019s wounded, jaded, in possession of her letters\u2026 and ready to make good on every promise Maddie never expected to keep. My thoughts...Sometimes a story will just 'tickle' me from start to finish, and this was one of those stories. It's a unique, fun, easy but not brainless tale that had me smiling, start to finish. Of course, this is Tessa Dare and that means it's also captivating and passionate and truly heartfelt, and to sum it up in a word; amazing! Note... ALL of the books in this series (so far) can be read as standalones - that said, no matter the order you read them in, read them all.

I must. I can't bear the guilt any longer. There's only one way to end this now.You have to die.\"\n\n*burst of laughing* I promise, I'm not a psycho. Trust me.It's been a while since my last Historical Romance - actually, I can say exactly since when I've started to get away from this genre : when I read this piece of absolute crap that's Once & Always, which combined romanticizing of abuse in all its forms. Trust me, I got turned off. So, yes. Some historical - and contemporary romances, for that matter - promote awful behaviors that are everything but love. This being said, shame on me to have painted all of historical romances with one brush : what Tessa Dare offers us is often all kinds of awesome.\u2611 Her heroines are hilarious, unconventional, strong-minded, and on the good side of quirky, that is to say, funny without being plain annoying, a little odd, but still relatable. Maddie is no exception to the rule : as shy and weird she can appear at first, I challenge you to dislike her. Really. #Team Maddie. \u2611 She creates non-raging male-leads who are sexy, sarcastic, driven but never violent or abusive : if Colin (A Week to Be Wicked) and Ransom (Romancing the Duke) stay my favorites, Logan earn his stripes in my heart with his quick mind and his loyalty. I would say his kilt made the difference, but erm - that would be lying. I'm not really into Highlanders and all these Scottish guys, but if you are, you're gonna love him. Don't expect to meet a perfect man, though : he blackmails her into marriage, for Pete sake. Keep this in mind. I can only promise you that he's no asshole. No, really. Believe me.\u2611 The storylines are over the top, flirting with total madness and never really believable, but I can't manage to care, because it's never boring. \u2611 The writing, addictive and hilarious, puts her books in the \"Do Not Read In Public\" box, even more if you own the paperbacks (can someone do something about these covers? Please? It's like they've been created to give ereaders a purpose or something). \u2611 The sex scenes are hot and the chemistry is always off the charts. So. When a Scot Ties the Knot? Think all that and more : + bromance & loyalty : I love these soldiers+ lobsters (sex tips)+ drawings of nails (yes, that counts) + the Scottish version of the Naked Man (in a loch, no less!)\n\"You strip down to your skin, and then you have a dip in the loch.

To be honest, I've never read Tessa Dare's books until now. When a Scot Ties the Knot is a quick read for me. I liked how it easily captured my attention without any attempt. The characters, Logan and Maddie, are the true epitome of perfection when they're coupled with passionate and teasing times. I couldn't stop giggling through this book for many reasons, especially at the beginning when two of them just meet for the first time and the heroine wants a great escape for this situation. She's so hilarious, and my first impression of her went well.\n\u201cWere I a bird, I\u2019d sing for thee.Were I a bee, I\u2019d sting for thee.Were I a peak, I\u2019d tower for thee.Were I a tree, I\u2019d flower for thee.Were I a flute, I\u2019d play for thee.Were I a steed, I\u2019d neigh for thee.Were I a fire, I\u2019d burn for thee.But being a man, I yearn for thee.\u201d\nLogan has his own issues of trusting someone. I kinda understand him why he has denied people all his life. And when it comes to Maddie, it's very hard because he feels something beyond normal attraction for her. Maddie, on the other hand, has an artistic soul and is very enthusiastic. She's the one who drives the story forward potentially, and I admired her for that.\nThou art bone of my bone, flesh of my flesh.\nUmmm. There's some point preventing me from giving the book five stars, though. I felt the last few chapters were jumpy for some reasons. The main characters were well engaged all along, then a little thing was flipped, and it was quite strange for me how the hero overcame his vulnerability so quickly as if somebody pushed his button right and it just happened.However, this is an enjoyable read. I've barely read histoical romance books since 2015, but this book worked, it's over my expectation, and I'm sorry that I haven't found this book early. I think there's more to come.

Between his chauvinism, his need to constantly lay claim to the female lead, his raging jealousy boner, and his use of sex as a weapon of vengeance, me no likey. The female lead wasn't much better for me. Honestly, she was kind of dense. This plot was much weaker than the first, and I didn't think either of their story lines was fleshed out very well. The male lead just got back from a decade of war and only one time does he think or speak about it? Weird. And the female lead's agoraphobia definitely could have used some finessing.

Now he was not only an impoverished orphan but an impoverished, unloved orphan with a passion for books. Her every feminine impulse jumped to attention. She was vibrating with the worst possible desires. The instinct to soothe, to comfort, to nurture, to hold.\u201cThat pitying look you\u2019re giving me,\u201d he said. \u201cI dinna think I like it.\u201d\u201cI don\u2019t like it, either.\u201d\u201cThen stop making it.\u201d \u201cI can\u2019t.\u201d She fluttered her hands. \u201cQuickly, say something unfeeling. Mock my letters. Threaten my beetles. Just do something, anything reprehensible.\u201d\nAs Maddie keeps putting off the consummation of the marriage the tension builds between them and I loved every second of that. The dialogue between them and how they got to know each other was a fun journey every step of the way.Off to the side there are some other fun characters Grant who plays an interesting role and has lost the ability to form long term memories often forgetting where they are and that the war is over. Also there is the cute Aunt Thea who was a great supporter of Maddie\u2019s love affair through letters and is thrilled that the Captain is not dead and has finally come into her family.\n\u201cIs this the moment where you warn me that if I hurt her, you\u2019ll slip poison in my tea?\u201d \u201cNo, no. What I have to say is much worse. If you\u2019re Maddie\u2019s husband, that means I\u2019m going to mother you.\u201d She gave him a quick, tight hug before releasing him. \u201cAnd you\u2019ll just have to endure it.\u201d\nNow I realize that if you are a strict regency romance buff and nitpick at historical details and inaccuracies then this book could drive you crazy. I\u2019m not judging I have the same issues with Sci-Fi most of the time. But I totally loved the relationship and story so much that I totally didn\u2019t care. It was fun, whimsical and exactly what I needed to read at the time.I still think that Romancing the Duke is the best book in the Castles Ever After Series but this is a close second. These can all be read as stand alones but I do recommend at least reading the first of the series since it was the best imho."}, {"userName": "\u2665Rachel\u2665", "userReviewDate": "Jul 16, 2015", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/5481477-rachel", "userReview": "Madeline Gracechurch is an introvert and freezes up into a panic when confronted with large crowds. So at the age of sixteen before she came into her first season Maddie invents a fianc\u00e9, Captain Logan MacKenzie. His creation saves her from all the awkward social gatherings her well-meaning family would\u2019ve forced on her. Captain McKenzie is conveniently in the army and she continues to send him letters not dreaming for a minute that there might be a real life Captain actually receiving them, until he shows up at Lannair Castle ready to marry his betrothed. Logan has been receiving Maddie\u2019s letters for years wondering what she looked like. He received sketches of snails, and moths, in addition to her letters, but never of Maddie herself. Doesn\u2019t matter what she looks like, though, her letters have provided a the perfect opportunity to give the small band of men in his command a chance at their dreams after years at war left them without land or sweethearts to come home to. With Lannair Castle and the surrounding land they can make a home. Logan was fine on his own, but willing to sacrifice for the good of the men who had become his family through the tough years of war. Maddie took him by surprise, with her beauty and big heart. Maddie invented Logan just so she could avoid the situation Logan has thrust upon her. She never wanted to be forced into a convenient, loveless marriage, even if it is to the dashing real Captain Logan MacKenzie. Maddie has her own hopes, dreams and goals. Observing and sketching life has long been her passion and now she\u2019s has the opportunity to make that dream profitable as an illustrator for gentlemen who want to catalog, and share their world explorations. This sham of a marriage threatens to ruin everything, but Logan threatens to ruin Maddie\u2019s reputation if she doesn\u2019t go a long.Maddie had a perfectly satisfying life without Logan, maybe a bit lonely at times, but this is no tale where the helpless female must be rescued by a strong man. Instead Maddie and Logan come to respect each other and enrich each other\u2019s lives with attraction, sensuality, and finally love!And despite all her best attempts not to, she\u2019d come to care for him\u2014the real, imperfect Logan. The man who set her body aflame with incendiary kisses and infuriated her with his arrogant presumptions and pushed her to emerge from her icy, frozen cocoon. One of the things I love most about this series is the clever banter, and witty humor Tessa Dare infused into each story. The many names of Captain Logan (assigned by Maddie according to mood) cracked me up! Jealous: Captain MacEnvy, tired: Captain Mac Sleepy, while addressing Logan in her letters it was Captain MacWhimsy, MacFantasy, or Imaginary Captain MacFigment. Haha!The Castles Ever After Series is historical romance at its finest! Tessa Dare combines clever humor, a strong, independent heroine, and a worthy hero, even if he is a bit of a rake and ravager. Come on, who wouldn\u2019t want to be ravaged by a gorgeous Highlander in a sexy kilt?! All three romances in this series were deliciously sensual, and beautifully written.

I admit, there were a lot of issues with the book, and as usual, it being a Tessa Dare novel, anachronism was one of them. A gentlewoman who publicly broadcasted that she worked as an illustrator? Yeah, not buying it. Also, her aunt lost her virtue without the blessing of marriage, but just brushed that bit off as if it didn't mean anything? Maddie thought her brain would twist from all these revelations. \u201cYou weren\u2019t debauched by the Comte de Montclair and ruined for all other men?\u201d\u201cOh, I went to bed with him. It wasn\u2019t terrible, but it wasn\u2019t magical, either. And no, that night did not ruin me for other men...\u201dOkay, whatever you say. You see, this is why I tend to avoid Tessa Dare's books. I normally don't mind anachronisms, but only up to a certain extent. It seems to be embedded on the very fabric of her stories, and that's what I don't like. Moreover, Maddie's character was also a strange mixture of contrasting traits. She was supposed to be a naturalist, which is a fancy term for a sort of scientist, but she was far too emotional. At the beginning, she was presented as a bluestocking, but she never showed the rationalism we might expect from one. She, herself, admitted that she was in danger of falling in love with Logan many times in the story, or at the very least, let her feelings get a hold of her. That's not something I would expect from a person with a scientific bend. Logan was charming most of the time, but the angst felt unnecessary and overdone at some parts, especially near the end. I remember grabbing fistful of my hair out of frustration with all the pushing and pulling that was happening. I wanted to scream, \"Just be honest with yourself, man! Jeez!\"Because of these, I almost gave the book a 3.75 rating (rounded down to 3), but holy hell, that epilogue was just so sweet. Oh. My. God. That part alone deserves its own .25 stars.And now if you will excuse me, I'm going to cry in the corner because real life will never be as magical as this.

The deception works a little too well and years later she find herself firmly on the shelf with an inherited Scottish castle and wearing half mourning for a \u2018fiancee\u2019 who sadly perished in battle. That is, until her Captain shows up at her castle, determined to marry her\u2026Give me a minute, I need some time to wipe the grin off my face after reading When a Scot Ties the Knot, because, in short this book was fantastic.

One doesn\u2019t, you just sit back and let Tessa Dare sweep you off your feet. The one thing that really stands out for me in this book is the beginning, where Maddie is writing letters to her fictitious fiancee to keep up the ruse. The letters are sweet the outpourings of an intelligent, funny but lonely young woman with a lively imagination and from that point I just knew I would love this book. I wasn\u2019t wrong and as I continued to read I was more and more enthralled with all the characters that Dare introduced.This leads me nicely into our sexy Scottish captain, Logan MacKenzie, who all this time has been receiving her letters. He is supposedly devoid of feeling and only wanting to marry Maddie so he and his men can set up a home in her castle and on her lands, he definitely has NOT treasured her letters and he definitely WASN\u2019T upset when she killed him off\u2026 The dialogue between Logan and Maddie had me glued to the page; it managed to be both, sexy and full of feeling, showing both characters at their best.\u201cI\u2019ve learned a thing or two about you.

What a terrific story. I laughed, I cried, got angry a few times, but closed with the book with a smile and a dreamy sigh. Madeline, at sixteen, wishes to avoid her first \u2018season\u2019, so she makes up a pretty tall tale about having met a Scottish Captain- Logan MacKenzie. She is betrothed to Logan, and stays true to him for many years, writing to him faithfully, until one day she decides this has gone on long enough and kills him off. But, to her utter shock, out the clear blue sky, a very real Logan MacKenzie shows up and insist he is the man Madeline has been writing to all these years and that he intends to marry her! Naturally, there is a catch. Logan needs Madeline\u2019s land for his men, and so blackmails her into marriage. But, Madeline, as mortified as she is, continues to postpone the consummation, frustrating Logan to no end. While determined to make the marriage valid, doing so without the emotional attachment that usually comes with that, is making things more and more complicated as time goes on. The more Madeline learns about Logan, the deeper she falls for him, but Logan is the most single minded man alive! Why does he deny his feelings for Madeline? Why is he still so angry with her for making a youthful mistake? Is the situation doomed or true love bring them to their senses? I loved both Madeline and Logan, so I wanted them to make it. Madeline is a person I could really relate to, as she suffers from social anxiety, and Logan will bring out all your nurturing instincts. But, I began to have my doubts as they continued to miscommunicate, misunderstand each other, argue, and hurt each other, although there were several very humorous predicaments too. But the sexual chemistry is certainly there and these two sure knew how to create tension. I loved the delayed gratification and the tantalizing build between this couple. It was almost perfect. I appreciated the authenticity, the wonderful Scottish Gaelic, the banter, humor, and awesome storytelling.

So this was slightly better than the last Tessa Dare book I read, but still nothing to make me enthusiastic. The same formulatic writing is used, the characters are so \"strange\" and individual that they appear comic-like, not to mention the side characters. I didn't get emotionally involved within the character's relationship or the story itself, so by the end I skipped rather than read. Like in the last few novels by Tessa Dare the comedian aspect would have applied in a good way to a CR, seeing that some aspects are so unrealistic that the story appears to be a costumed-up, third rate comedy show. Maybe the author's writing style was like that all along and I only noticed recently, but I won't watch out for the next books in the series. I've been very picky in my reading stuff for quite some time now, which I think is a natural process when one has read a fair share of novels, especially of one genre.

I also don't buy into the whole, \"He's mean, but I can't help but like him and feel sympathy for him\" reasoning. This man deserved no sympathy, and to be honest nether did she. This story should be categorized under \"Fantasy\" because it was no better than a childs fairytale. All of the plot was so nice and neatly convenient - example: 1. There really was a Capt. Logan Mackenzie at the ficitious regiment she addressed the letters too.2. That her uncle just so happens to leave her a castle in Scottland and dies3. That a manwhore has remained celibate after receiving childish letters from a derranged 16 year old woman just tops the list of absurdity.

As a young girl of sixteen, Maddie is painfully shy and a terrifying childhood experience has left her suffering from anxiety attacks when in the midst of crowds.In any large gathering\u2014 be it a market, a theater, a ballroom\u2014 she had a tendency to freeze, almost literally. An arctic sense of terror took hold of her, and the crush of bodies rendered her solid and stupid as a block of ice.With Maddie\u2019s first season approaching and her stepmother pointedly suggesting that she might find herself a suitable gentleman to marry, Maddie panics and blurts that she has already met him. So starts \u201can outrageous falsehood that would, for better and worse, determine the rest of her life\u201d. I loved the letters Maddie writes to her fictitious sweetheart because they not only act as a clever plot device but also provide an insight into Maddie\u2019s character. They also contain some delightful humour as evidenced here.Dear Captain Imaginary MacFigment,O happy day! Ring the bells, sound the trumpets. Swab the floors with lemon oil. My father\u2019s bride is vomiting profusely every morning, and most every afternoon, as well. The signs are plain. A noisy, smelly, writhing thing will push its way into the world in some six or seven months\u2019 time.After inheriting a castle in Scotland from her godfather and, with only her Aunt Thea as companion, Maddie is at last independent and able to pursue her budding career as a scientific illustrator. However, her world is about to be shattered when her killed-in-battle, fictitious captain turns up on her doorstep, very much alive.Big, brawny, Logan stole my heart. I love how deeply he cares about his men and his determination to do anything within his power to help them rebuild their lives even if it means resorting to blackmail. His actions towards Maddie may not be honourable but his motives definitely are.His gruff exterior hides a very lonely, disillusioned man and I like how Ms Dare gradually reveals his past; his abandonment as a child, the deprivations he suffered and the duplicity of the vicar who gave him a home. He grew up in a world devoid of love. His men are the only real family he has ever known and I could understand his belief that love is nothing but a lie people tell themselves.The sweet, tender, poignant and deliciously sexy love story between Maddie and Logan is further enhanced by sparkling dialogue and hilariously funny scenes. One of my favourites is where Maddie gets stuck in a bog.\u201cRelax,\u201d he said. \u201cThe ones who do perish, they die of the exposure or thirst. Not because they\u2019re sucked under.\u201d\u201cSo you\u2019re saying . . .\u201d\u201cYou\u2019ll be fine. We\u2019ll build a little roof over your head and bring you bannocks twice a day. You can live here quite happily for years.\u201dAnother of my favourites is when Logan is forced to read aloud the excruciatingly terrible poem he is supposed to have written to Maddie. It\u2019s priceless.It tugged at my heartstrings when Logan reveals just how much Maddie\u2019s letters meant to him.\u201cIt felt as if I\u2019d tugged on a loose thread of God\u2019s tartan, and a world away, someone tugged back\u201d.I love how Maggie gives Logan the love and family he has always secretly yearned for and Logan encourages Maddie to follow her dreams.There is a wonderful cast of secondary characters including Logan\u2019s men, each with their own distinct personalities, Maddie\u2019s delightful Aunt Thea and, of course, not forgetting Rex and Fluffy.I can\u2019t end my review without mentioning the Epilogue\u2026 just lovely!MY VERDICT: Tessa Dare continues to captivate me with her wonderful writing, heart-warming stories, endearing characters and sparkling humour.REVIEW RATING: 5/5 STARSCastles Ever After series so far (click on the cover for more details):\n\n\nThis review is also posted on my Rakes and Rascals blog:https://rakesandrascals.wordpress.com..."}, {"userName": "Blacky *Romance Addict*", "userReviewDate": "Nov 19, 2016", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/8310179-blacky-romance-addict", "userReview": "Why have I not read this author before????
