He constructed the review in August 2016. I am one of the few people bothering to take a look at this book after the election. The reason for the fact that is now largely being ignored is that it was funny once and no longer can be funny, as the joke has turned on us. We have become the joke. And this book, almost eerily prophetic, now seems deeply sad. In other words, political satirist/cartoonist Trudeau can\u2019t be blamed. When businessman blowhard narcissist Trump was floating the idea of running for President first in 1987 (!!) (which his son continues to say is a step down for his billionaire father), Trudeau saw this as a rich opportunity for ridicule. And he has been doing this for THIRTY YEARS. Being a man of \u201ca certain age\u201d and political leaning (guess!) I have read almost all of these strips as they were published from then and until today, and I thought it was all a rich commentary on certain American tendencies. The commentary was and is consistent with the dark satire of Hunter S. Thompson in books such as Fear and Loathing in Las Vegas. Crass and ugly Americanism. Self-promotion at the expense of anything resembling democracy.And what did Trudeau say to Amy Goodman when she asked if he was surprised at the US election results?Yes. I\u2019m no smarter than anyone else in terms of understanding where this was all going to go. My assumption, after 2012, when he was attacking the president and he got his first taste of double-digit poll numbers, that he would make a run this time around. But I thought it would be just as part of the\u2014his normal brand enhancement and that once he\u2019d gotten the maximum promotional value out of a run, that he would step out. Who knew he would catch on like this? Certainly not me.https://www.democracynow.org/2016/8/5...Trump has not ignored Trudeau, ever. Trump calls him \"overrated,\" \"a sleazeball,\" \"a jerk\" and \"a total loser.\" He\u2019s the first cartoonist to win the Pulitzer Prize, but you know what he would say about that committee that voted for Trudeau\u2019s prize.You can find the strips all online, but here\u2019s a sample:http://doonesbury.washingtonpost.com/...It\u2019s not his best stuff, actually, but it gets better as we get into the new century. One of the members of his election team said, yesterday, meeting with members of the Clinton team in a public forum, \u201cThe mistake you all made was taking everything he says seriously, as if it corresponds to the facts. The American people obviously didn\u2019t do that.\u201dRight. But some of us American and international people who are prepared to actually listen to and analyze what people actually say (and do) and call bullshit when they lie or just talk off the top of their heads, we didn\u2019t ignore what Trump said and says, and we won\u2019t. As Trudeau also said, \u201cIf Trump wins, I'll miss civilization as we know it.\u201dVery funny, Garry. Why am I not laughing?"}, {"userName": "Iris P", "userReviewDate": "Nov 22, 2016", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/2641948-iris-p", "userReview": "From the book blurb:\n\"He tried to warn us.

And it goes on from there. Trump called Trudeau a \"third-rate talent trying to get publicity on my back\".

He first admitted thinking about it in 1987. But Garry Trudeau has been featuring him his \"Doonesbury\" comic for at least 30 years. He's never been one of the main characters but has often been an adjunct character; the others play off him and the aura he gives off. Trudeau has usually featured him with the blonde/orange hair, but in recent years, the coif has become more exaggerated. He's also been written with an \"edge\" and an air of venality, seemingly absent from the other characters. \"Duke\", a reprehensible character (and my favorite, along with Honey) is written with a bit of humor, even when he's captaining Trump's yacht. Trump has not been so depicted and in the last few years, the venality has not been particularly funny.Garry Trudeau has published a new book, \"Yuge!\", repeating the strips featuring Donald Trump. It's been released at a good time. Trudeau began \"covering\" Donald Trump in the late 1980's when he was prominent developer in New York City...and Garry Trudeau was a prominent cartoonist. Trump was married to Ivana and Garry was married to Jane. Flash forward 20 some odd years and Trump is married to Melania and Garry is still married to Jane. Trump did not like being mocked in print and said so, loudly. Trudeau continued to use Donald Trump as a character, much to Trump's annoyance. Trump tossed slams at Garry Trudeau and Graydon Carter of \"Spy Magazine\" in interviews. Later, \"tweets\" became Trump's means of fighting back at people he considered \"unfair\" to him.

From his early dalliances with the bigotry of birtherism to his full-blown fear and hatred on the campaign trail, Trump rants ... and is skewered by Trudeau's superb wit.(And though I found the majority of this book less than Trudeau's usual brilliance, it's still great to have all these Trump strips in one place.)"}, {"userName": "Writemoves", "userReviewDate": "Jul 27, 2016", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/10930268-writemoves", "userReview": "I have been a fan of Doonesbury and G.B.
