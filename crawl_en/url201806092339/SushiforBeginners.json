It's another one that I managed to read on planes and in airports but wouldn't make time for reading it when I wouldn't otherwise be bored to tears.I agree with other reviews here that the characters are not developed. In many cases, as with Jack, Lisa, and even Ashling, the characters change, even sometimes drastically, but we never really get to understand why. We are told the actions of characters in the past and given some glimpses into what upbringing and past relationships they've had, but it doesn't easily flow into present character actions. The relationships amongst the characters aren't well developed either.It's not difficult to read such superficial stories, but it's also not as enjoyable to not better get to know the participants in the novel."}, {"userName": "Jen", "userReviewDate": "Dec 29, 2008", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/250836-jen", "userReview": "Let's see. Take Bridget Jones, mix with The Devil Wears Prada, add some Irish details and remove about 50% of the interesting plot details and you have this book. I previously had read another book of Keyes' that I enjoyed a lot but I found this one a bit of a slog to get through. I admire her portrayal of an unappealing main character (Lisa) but it didn't really work for me as light reading. Overall, I'd say it is a professionally-rendered execution of an idea that just didn't appeal to me personally."}, {"userName": "Jennifer", "userReviewDate": "May 14, 2014", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/2473504-jennifer", "userReview": "I will be leaving Sushi for Beginners by Marian Keyes without a formal rating simply because I can't explain why I didn't care for it, which leads me to believe it was a timing or mood issue on my part. I listened to the audiobook intermittently while spending a very LONG day-nearly ten hours-in jury duty...that right there explains it! If I had to rate this title today, I would give it 1 or 2 stars but that rating just wouldn't be fair. However, the only honest feedback I can give is that the audiobook quality is pretty poor. I will consider re-reading it at a later date."}, {"userName": "Morgan", "userReviewDate": "Dec 11, 2015", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/1977404-morgan", "userReview": "I think one of the stars is for my accent enjoyment due to listening to the audio.Just wasn't my cuppa, and the fact that it stretched so long in the audio version didn't help matters much.Also I wake up at 1am to go into work now so, being entertained is much more of a requirement at the moment. lol."}, {"userName": "Nick Davies", "userReviewDate": "Jul 01, 2017", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/51454575-nick-davies", "userReview": "Now, I've quite like Marian Keyes as a person when I've seen her on telly, I quite enjoyed 'Rachel's Holiday' when I read it a good few years ago, and I don't mind the odd book in the chick-lit/lad-lit genre. This, alas, was a little disappointing and more of a two and a half than a three and a half. This is a clunky opening paragraph, isn't it?The book follows the lives of three or four (or more) young women living in Dublin, centred around a women's magazine. There's lots of romance, bitching, glamour. There are some serous points made about the family/career balance, trust and relationships, and even stuff about clinical depression. Despite all this, I just found it all a bit long and relentless with the repetition of little jokey comments that could be reduced to \"..ooh, aren't men rubbish!..\" followed by \"..ooh, but aren't we daft girls for loving them despite this!..\" for 550 pages. It was quite entertaining and enjoyable, but I would've preferred to be more amused by something around half the length. Perhaps because most of the characters are in the end a bit unpleasant, the story could've done with losing a few of them."}, {"userName": "Jane", "userReviewDate": "Feb 27, 2008", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/942414-jane", "userReview": "I finally finished this book. I had started Sushi for Beginners only a few days before it was due back to the library and never really got time to read much... now having finished it, I can say it was an interesting read. I am not sure why I was compelled to read and keep reading, but I was. It was different having three \"main\" characters, and surprisingly not overly confusing either. The reader got to see different points of view from Lisa, Ashling, and Clodagh (all of whom are girls despite how the names may look). All three women are friends/ become acquaintances during the book. Of the three, Ashling got the most story time, however Lisa was probably my favorite character of them for some reason. The book had less to do with sushi than the title may suggest, however, it is still an apt title as \"sushi for beginners\" is somewhat of a theme perhaps symbolizing trying new things or change."}, {"userName": "Jenn", "userReviewDate": "Jul 08, 2012", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/3971571-jenn", "userReview": "It's not going to win any literary awards, but this is a great book for when you just want a fun read!

Magazine editor Lisa Edwards meets with her bosses about a new job they have lined up for her to launch a new magazine called Colleen. Lisa is already visualizing a new posh lifestyle for herself in New York. However, New York isn't quite where her new job has been set up. She's pretty much being deported to Dublin to fend for herself, start anew and make this new magazine the next big thing. Ashling Kennedy is the assistant editor for Colleen. She's a bit frumpy and unhappy with her non-existent waistline and her non-existent social life. Meanwhile, Ashling's best friend, Clodagh Kelly, is living the high life and seems to have it all. But she's searching for something more. The transition from one singleton's point of view to the next is smooth and unmistakable. And the ups and downs these women go through are hilarious to follow. This is a romantic comedy that hits just the right tone with the writing style and comedic dialogue. It's like getting three novels in one. With Sushi for Beginners, Marian Keyes does a great job in capturing perfect settings and following these women on their search for happiness."}, {"userName": "Arnetra", "userReviewDate": "Sep 08, 2007", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/359483-arnetra", "userReview": "For Ashling Kennedy, the new job she lands at start-up Irish fashion magazine Colleen is a dream come true. For Lisa Edwards, a high-maintenance London editor expecting a promotion to New York, her appointment as editor-in-chief of Colleen is a slap in the face, the only consolation being her rumpled-but-handsome new boss, Jack Devine. Furious at being passed up for a job at Manhattan magazine, Lisa vows to make Colleen the envy of the fashion industry, even if it kills her. She drives her Dublin staff to exhaustion, and Colleen becomes a smashing success. But after a particularly lusty meeting with her much-maligned long-distance London boyfriend, she wonders if the move and the single-minded career obsession have been worth it. Meanwhile, Ashling is betrayed by her boyfriend and her best friend Clodagh, whose bourgeois domesticity she's long envied.

I could not care for any of her characters - workaholic Lisa was plain annoying, Ashling was just boring (though she was by far the best of the bunch), and I constantly wanted to yell at Clodagh to \"Shut uuuup!\". I also thought the book was too long for a story that barely developed, and in the end, some things (like Ashling's relationship) happened too fast. Some parts were funny (but I wasn't laughing out loud like in \"Watermelon\") but mostly I just finished it for finishing's sake, and retained nothing of it (except that I hate Clodagh).

The characters weren't really developed, Keyes just basically told us what the characters were doing and never let them grow past their one dimensioned personalities. The only one who escapes that fate is Lisa, the hardass editor. And she doesn't even develop so much as suddenly she's just different. The secondary characters were so over the top that they were completely unbelievable. By the time the last chapter rolled around, I didn't even care enough to read the entire thing, I just skimmed to find out how each characters story ends.

By comparison, I also found it less rewarding when I finished reading, but that's only when putting the two books side by side.Individually speaking, Sushi for Beginners is quite an enjoyable read. Ashling was cute and I didn't find her entirely boxed into the she's-a-weird-nerd type, thankfully. I still feel that her struggle with long-lasting issues wasn't dealt as nicely as it could have been. She pulls through a little too neatly, and while at it, we're not privy to exactly HOW the relationship with the man of her life progresses before they're officially declared an item. But maybe that's just me being a picky little bugger.I found Lisa's character to be the most compelling. She's infuriating, she's a bitch, and she's the most complex character of the book, in my opinion. Fiercely independent, heartbreakingly vulnerable, ambitious, dominant, passive, trusting, willing to be led by the man she loves, and damn good at her job. Her story was bittersweet and I felt she truly deserved the ending she got. She grew a lot along the way, and I found that admirable. Clodagh... her name alone just about killed my brain. I can't picture how it's pronounced to save my life. I could relate to her to a certain extent, but in the end, she was the hardest to swallow. Immature and self-centered, she's the one character I would have just LOVED to throttle a little. Still, her portrayal was quite spot-on, so there's nothing to complain about, I suppose. All in all, I liked the book, despite its shortcomings."}, {"userName": "Shannon", "userReviewDate": "Jul 30, 2008", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/852983-shannon", "userReview": "One nice thing about Marian Keyes' books is that all of her characters feel like real people that you might meet on the street. And the consequences for their actions are also \"real\". In this novel, three women are looking for love and success. First there is the super-fashionista, Lisa, who feels she has been demoted at work by being sent to Dublin, Ireland to head up a new women's fashion magazine. During this time of extreme stress, she is also in the midst of a divorce with her fashion-photographer husband, whom she still loves. The second woman, Ashling, is hired to be the assistant editor of this maagazine. She is nick-named \"little miss fix-it\" due to her life-long habit of trying to \"mother\" people and fix their lives. She becomes involved with a stand-up comedien, but she can't decide whether she loves him, or loves the idea of him. The third woman is Clodagh, long-time best friend of Ashling, who is currently an ineffective mother of two young children. Clodaugh is ealizing that she has given up her life to make her family members live's comfortable, meanwhile, she is having a personal breakdown.

And instead she's a monster, and the book tries to make it seem like her monstrousness was foregrounded because she stole Dylan (her future husband) from Ashling all those years before so we should have expected this, and now she's going to get her comeuppance and we're going to enjoy it. WHAT. NO. I'm sorry, but if you go on one date with a guy and then he picks your friend instead, that sucks and you get to be mad at her, but you don't get to act like this is some sort of pattern when she HAS AN AFFAIR AND STEALS YOUR BOYFRIEND ELEVEN YEARS LATER.

Her other books that I have read covered difficult topics and had a lot more drama than this book. In places this book moved very slowly. We follow 3 main characters; Lisa, Ashling and Clodagh. I really didn't like Lisa and I had no sympathy for Clodagh. Lisa had moved from a very glamourous magazine to Dublin and she wasn't happy as she was hoping to get promoted to New York. Lisa was really horrible to her work colleagues and I couldn't feel any sympathy as she came across as being really spoilt and entitiled. Clodagh was married and had two children and seemed to have a really good live but she cheated on her husband. In my eyes this is always bad and I had no sympathy when she finally got caught. For me this book was just ok. It was quite slow in places and perhaps longer than it needed to be. It was an enjoyable read and I am glad I can finally take it off my TBR as it had been on it for over 2 years.
