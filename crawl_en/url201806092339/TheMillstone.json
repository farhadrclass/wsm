I remember being very moved by it, though too naive and inexperienced to relate to much of it. Nearly 30 years and one (planned) child later, I found it an excellent piece of writing, albeit for somewhat different reasons.Times may have changed in terms of the social acceptability of single parenthood, but it all rings very true for its time and many of her feelings around the time of the birth are pretty universal.It is a good mix of funny, thoughtful and sad, and avoids moralising, sentimentality or tidy plotting.It is interesting to compare it with Lynne Reid Banks' The L Shaped Room, which is a similar situation, written and set at roughly the same time (my review HERE) and also McEwan's On Chesil Beach (my review HERE), which is a very different story, but which also features a woman struggling with sexual intimacy, against the zeitgeist of the \"swinging\" 60s."}, {"userName": "Jean", "userReviewDate": "Jul 22, 2013", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/19300421-jean", "userReview": "[This \u201clittle one\u201d, is vulnerable, and subject to harm, especially because of her her congenital heart defect.

Its heroine Rosamund has an academic background similar to Drabble's and is cushioned by being able to live rent free in her travelling parents' London flat.In the first half of the book she drifts into a decision to keep the baby, and there is plenty of humour in the caricatured reactions of everyone she meets. She conveniently acquires a flatmate in Lydia, an aspiring novelist who is discovered to be writing about her which allows a slightly metafictional layer to be developed.In the second half of the book the baby Octavia is born and Rosamund finds redemption in unexpected ways (none of which involve the various men she is involved with).I found this book interesting and very enjoyable - particularly so soon after reading her latest one The Dark Flood Rises last month."}, {"userName": "Girl with her Head in a Book", "userReviewDate": "May 15, 2018", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/14037242-girl-with-her-head-in-a-book", "userReview": "For my full review: http://girlwithherheadinabook.co.uk/2...My main awareness of Margaret Drabble has always been that she is the sister of A.S. Byatt, who wrote\u00a0Possession, one of my very favourite books, and that the pair of them have had some sort of long-running feud which may or may not have been over-cooked by the 'gossip columns' but that either way, they do not read each other's books. \u00a0I am doubtful that it is out of any misplaced loyalty to Byatt that I have avoided Drabble's fiction for so long but with one thing and another, reading\u00a0The Millstone did feel slightly overdue. \u00a0I remember half-listening to the BBC Radio 4 adaptation a good number of years ago but although I was aware of the basic plot outline, I was not expecting this odd little novel of middle-class guilt and liberal neurosis. \u00a0Now fifty years old,\u00a0The Millstone\u00a0feels almost like a relic, of this time where society was not quite ready for the swinging sixties but was slowing cutting loose from more conservative mores. \u00a0The tale of Rosamund's\u00a0baby feels close at hand but is quite the vintage piece.Rosamund Stacey is a young Cambridge graduate who is studying towards her thesis and playing at being promiscuous without ever doing the deed; by seeing two men at once, she manages to avoid sleeping with either. \u00a0Nervous of physical relations, she is nevertheless caught off guard by George from the BBC and a very brief encounter leaves her unexpectedly pregnant. \u00a0Despite rather uncertainly trying to induce a miscarriage via the medium of gin and a hot bath (her friends drink the gin, the bath goes cold), Rosamund decides to keep her child and not to tell George. \u00a0There are obvious parallels here to\u00a0The L-Shaped Room and also\u00a0On Chesil Beach when it comes to sexuality - in 1960s Britain, Rosamund has become a fallen woman, an unwed mother - the latter labelled noted when she gives birth by the large U marked at the end of the bed. \u00a0But while Rosamund quickly comes to love her daughter, who she names after Octavia Hill, more trouble is around the corner when the child falls ill.The title obviously refers to the baby Octavia, whose existence will of course be seen by others as the millstone around her mother's neck. \u00a0The initial reference comes from the Gospel of Matthew, 'But whoso shall offend one of these little ones who believe in me, it were better that a millstone were hanged about his neck and that he were drowned in the depth of the sea'. \u00a0I could not help but find it\u00a0rather trope-ish for a woman to fall pregnant as a result of only one sexual encounter - am I supposed to pity Rosamund due to her one lapse while another young woman in the same situation but with a lengthier sexual history might be said to have brought the trouble down on her own head? \u00a0The episode between her and George had a poignancy, with neither quite having the confidence or courage to state what they actually wanted. \u00a0Throughout the novel, Rosamund hears George's voice on the radio, considers calling him, feels even a gratitude towards him for bringing him her daughter but her love for Octavia supersedes anything she might have ever felt for him.Drabble has stated that the novel was intended to represent how motherhood 'turns you into something fiercer' and this does seem true for Rosamund, whose diffidence and uncertainty mark her as an unlikely heroine. \u00a0From a middle-class and socialist family, she is ridden with liberal guilt; along with her siblings, she was put through state school, encouraged to love the NHS and not to over-burden it, her parents even insisted on befriending their cleaning-lady and feigning unawareness when she stole the silver, despising them for their weakness. Rosamund is well aware that she is in an acutely fortunate situation, as with her parents are away in Africa, they have allowed her to stay in their spacious London flat rent free, leaving Rosamund crippled with embarrassment that her friends assume incorrectly that she is rich. \u00a0Further guilt is aroused by the fact that her thesis is focused on Elizabethan poets, and she repeatedly notes that 'the Elizabethans, except for Shakespeare, are something of a luxury subject, unlike nineteenth century novelists or prolific Augustan poets'. \u00a0Good-looking, intelligent and comfortably off, Rosamund feels simply terrible for the advantages which nature has given her, and so burdens herself with lack-lustre students who she under-charges as a mis-guided attempt to assuage her guilt. \u00a0It's hard to avoid feeling a sort of impatience with Rosamund since she clearly does care about what is going around her but her passivity makes it seem as though she is allowing her life to happen to her rather than vice versa.Assuring the reader repeatedly that she had not been ill in years and had had no idea how to go about approaching medical services, Rosamund shuns Harley Street like a good socialist and flings herself upon the mercies of the NHS. \u00a0Her sister writes anxious instructions that the child should be adopted and then as little seen of it as possible. Rosamund is hurt but renewed in her determination. \u00a0Other relatives are quietly shunned. \u00a0A friend kindly informs her that she can still work for the BBC as the regulations allow unmarried mothers as long as they have no more than two offspring. \u00a0The NHS staff politely refer to her at all times as Mrs Stacey, but make observations about her which are noted as Not To Be Seen By Patient. Rosamund looks around at those waiting with her and feels grateful for her clothes and address which mark out her privilege, not wishing to be one of them. \u00a0Yet still, there is Rosamund's wordless terror when Octavia is diagnosed with a serious heart condition - if her adored child dies, there will be those who will tell her that it is a blessing. \u00a0Desperate for her child's survival, horrified that Octavia seems to be paying for her mother's sin, Rosamund returns once more to the NHS for help. \u00a0Writing from a time when the NHS was still, if not in its infancy at the very least in its adolescence, I felt a far greater awareness and gratitude at what it affords than is appreciated today. \u00a0Yet still, there are antiquated notions still in operation in this fledgling service and a true dystopian horror as the ward sister refuses to allow Rosamund access to her child, since mothers only upset the children and this cannot be considered for another couple of weeks. \u00a0We have come a long way.The Millstone is less about the consequences of sexual liberation (indeed, Rosamund never really achieves this) and it seems to be more about the primacy of motherhood. \u00a0The love affair is not between Rosamund and George but rather between Rosamund and her baby Octavia. \u00a0After all the uncertainty around the men in her life, Rosamund is taken aback that her daughter is so fond of her, that Octavia clearly prefers\u00a0her to all other candidates. \u00a0The blank horror of being separated from her sends her into a wild hysteria and even when her acquaintance with a doctor is able to gain her access to her child, Rosamund remains plagued with guilt about all of the other mothers separated from their children by the whim of the hospital staff. \u00a0Her encounter with another mother who has successfully gained entry to the hospital is salutary, with the other woman kindly but firmly advising her to consider her own child and her own life before she frets away about other people. \u00a0Recognising that this fellow-parent speaks from necessity rather than the 'brisk, Tory contempt, or a businesslike, blinkered air of proud realism' which Rosamund has spent her life trying to avoid, her perspective shifts. \u00a0That being said,\u00a0The Millstone\u00a0is one of the few novels that can be truly said to have changed legislation, with rules being shifted around hospital visiting times for children. \u00a0No woman should ever have to scream blue murder to have access to her sick child.Still, the novel is not directly criticising the seeking of social justice and is liberal rather than anything else. \u00a0It captures more the difficulties of a life of perfect principle, of the impossibility of pleasing everyone and also how much easier life can be when one stops fatalising one's every move. \u00a0Having been an outsider for so long, plagued by anxieties about how others must look at her and judge her privilege, suddenly Rosamund can\u00a0even feel a kinship with these other women in the waiting room. \u00a0She reaches out to her cross-looking neighbours who are suddenly very understanding. Rosamund does not compromise her ambition, she does not compromise her self or her principles but her life becomes more of deeds than ideas. \u00a0The Millstone\u00a0concerns itself heavily with morality with Rosamund preoccupied by her social conscience but by the end of the novel, there is a greater feeling of lightness and casting down of burdens as she begins to see that that people are far more ready to be sympathetic than she had thought. \u00a0Was the millstone perhaps not her baby daughter and rather the insecurities, assumptions and anxieties which she had hung around her own neck?"}, {"userName": "Bruce", "userReviewDate": "Mar 20, 2015", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/1449923-bruce", "userReview": "London in the early 1960s is a place where casual sex is becoming acceptable, but having a child out of wedlock is not. Twenty-six year old scholar and doctoral student Rosamund Stacey is dating two men whose company she enjoys, but she\u2019s really not interested in getting physical with either one. She more interested in Elizabethan poets and her academic career. Then a chance meeting with a likable radio announcer leads to an invitation to her flat, and after her first and only sexual encounter she finds herself pregnant. In keeping with her independent values and her \u201cstrange mixture of confidence and cowardice,\u201d she decides to have the child and not tell the father about her pregnancy.Told in the first person, Rosamund\u2019s pregnancy and first year of motherhood is a tale of an intelligent young woman making her way in the world that\u2019s worthy of Jane Austen. Like Austen\u2019s heroines, Rosamund is comfortably middle class, but unlike them she is not surrounded by family. Her parents are in Africa teaching, and she is alone in their home in London with only friends and casual acquaintances around her. She is, by temperament and design, a loner, but after the birth of her daughter Octavia she finds herself overwhelmed by maternal love with all its tender devotion and obsessive worry. This tension is a fire that Drabble stokes right up to the final pages of the novel. Like Austen\u2019s, Drabble\u2019s domestic fiction sharply reflects the society, its foibles and inequalities, in which it is set. Rosamund is aware that her social position has allowed her to make the choice to have child and career that would not be possible for others with less means and social connections."}, {"userName": "Ana Duque", "userReviewDate": "Jan 01, 2018", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/33844219-ana-duque", "userReview": "No s\u00e9 qu\u00e9 decir de este libro. \u00bfMe ha gustado?

While the novel is readable and - at least for the four-fifths of its length - manages to be largely inoffensive for such a subject (single motherhood in the 60s), it ends with the kind of run-of-the-mill writing one associates with Mills and Boon romances. Rosamund Stacey, the Cambridge postgraduate, is so bland one can hardly associate her with anything concerning (gasp!) sexuality. Somehow she manages to beget an illegitimate child with a man who has as much debonair charm as Mr Ronald MacDonald.

I found the writing really enthralling, and Drabble's tone was exactly in my literary wheelhouse. Was so perfectly wry and British, I loved the dry humor and loved the narrator's voice; for that alone I couldn't help but keep reading, not because I couldn't bear to not find out how the story resolved itself, but simply because I was so amused by Rosamund's inner monologue. She wasn't a flawless heroine by any means (far from it), but I found her really engaging and appreciated her candor. Also, even though the plot wasn't one that inherently interests me, I did think it was made more interesting given that the unplanned pregnancy was also tackled out of wedlock, which was still super dicey in the 1960s when the novel was first published. Interesting to see how we have progressed, but to read the story through that lens and the additional challenges faced by women in that situation made the story even more enjoyable. Nice slice of history and one of the more unabashedly enjoyable reads I have encountered in a long while.[As an aside, I have mixed feelings about the motherhood storyline and am unclear about what Drabble was trying to say about the importance of children to women... but rather than be overly pessimistic, I will err on the side of cautious optimism and choose to believe she was merely suggesting that it was possible for women to be both mothers and career-oriented without having to pick one over the other. I hope she wasn't suggesting that even those of us who feel little to no desire to have children will find ourselves unknowingly unfulfilled lest we do, but I allow that such an interpretation of the text is possible.)"}, {"userName": "Lightblue", "userReviewDate": "Apr 11, 2013", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/16188792-lightblue", "userReview": "The MillstoneSono venuta a conoscenza di questo libro perch\u00e8 incuriosita dalla casa editrice Astoria che non conoscevo ma che, a quanto pare, pubblica delle piccole perle.

In the beginning, Rosamund carefully explains her previous reservations about sex and relationships. She is hopeless when it comes to sex specifically and has focused all her abilities towards her work in which she is very successful. Her mindset is unfortunately one in which a successful scholar cannot expect success in other parts of their life because that would be expecting too much. She recounts her past failed sexual exploits leading up to the moment in which she also fails at aborting the child she realizes she\u2019s expecting. Instead of leading with the story of how she became pregnant she recounts the failed abortion only to later fill in the gaps. This is important because she introduces her life and the people in it prior to introducing the character of the father of her baby. In a way, he\u2019s irrelevant to the story in the beginning because it is the people she chooses to be around that also end up being there for her in times of need. The father of her child was someone she found charming but not necessarily in love with. While Rosamund slowly leads the reader into the story of how she became pregnant she sets the stage instead for how it is that she was able to cope and eventually embrace an unwanted pregnancy during the 1960\u2019s. She fully acknowledges that her class privilege, education, and station in life allowed her to have a child and stay on top of her work. She laments that without these things neither her nor her baby would have been very well off. It is this acknowledgement to the struggle of motherhood in general that gives Rosamund the endearing qualities of a mother who will do anything necessary for her child. The same qualities make her relatable to women who choose to work and have family despite the hardships. It is in this aspect that Drabble was able to write a character with a personality of an intelligent yet na\u00efve woman who comes into her own via motherhood. Her baby is born requiring a surgery that is made easier to bear in part by a connection to her parents. She explains how her economic situation while gainfully employed was not necessarily one in which she didn\u2019t want for. Her parents selflessly allow her their flat while they temporarily moved out of the country; without this, she would have certainly been worse off and so would her baby. Furthermore, her descriptions of her experiences with the National Health System further her perspective in motherhood because she is made aware of how other classes handle motherhood and the difficulties it can present. Tess Cosslett identifies how class, race, and gender identity all play important factors in Rosamunds portrayal of the female middle class identity. In Cosslett\u2019s article Nancy S. Hardin is quoted as saying that Rosamund \u201cmoves from an intellectual position\u2026to a real social awareness which only participation can bring about\u2026The National Heath Clinic offers her the first insights of understanding\u2026First comes her heightened awareness of \u2018others\u2019, and second, even more important, her identification with them\u201d (Cosslett). Therefore, Rosamund\u2019s experience in pregnancy and childbirth further acknowledges the realization of class differences playing an integral role in her success as a single mother. \tAuthor Tessa Hadley points out that Rosamund has an adventure that finds freedom throughout the story, \u201cRosamund\u2019s adventure is pregnancy and motherhood, and her freedom is the option\u2026to become a single parent without stigma\u201d (Hadley). While her sexual encounter is an integral feature to the story, it doesn\u2019t receive much attention in Rosamunds narrative because the relationship most important to her is that of her and her baby Octavia. She so selflessly devotes herself to becoming a mother that she casts aside her own pre-conceived notions of what a family consists of and what constitutes real love. Furthermore, the climax occurs when all her attention to manners and behavior are cast aside in favor of a wild defensive stance on behalf of her daughter that fully realizes her potential as a mother (Hadley). She is raising her daughter alone and will continue to do so despite having a second chance encounter with the father George. Since Rosamund has both the means and the love required to raise a child alone she is more of an exception in a society where it was frowned upon to have a child out of wedlock given the remarks of others and the designation of U for unmarried at her bedside. \tInstead of having a partner to lean on in the form of a husband, Rosamund is able to call on her friends and the help of others in order to continue her work with a child. This is a sign of growth for an independent woman who was neither used to asking for help nor being responsible for anyone else. When she reluctantly asks her neighbor for help she comes to the realization that they are in fact kind and she had been wrong in assuming they would not help her. It is moments like this in the story where she comes to terms with the fact that she is not in entirely alone and that asking for help is necessary when raising a child. Her hardships are those in which many women find themselves in whether they are married or not. Drabble\u2019s portrayal of motherhood is one where Rosamund\u2019s socio-economic situation acknowledges its advantages through her experiences with women of all classes. Rosamund\u2019s parents have raised her to humbly acquiesce to the needs of others while she has learned on her own what it is to love someone unconditionally thanks to Octavia. There are repeated moments in the story where Rosamund continually judges women both in and out of the clinic based on their actions and looks as she tries to find something in common with other pregnant women. This is the one negative element to her take on motherhood that is perhaps the greatest reflection of her class differences. However, in regards to motherhood specifically, this book depicted what was a generally an unfortunate situation into a positive experience for both mother and child and an enjoyable read overall. In an interview by NPR, Tessa Hadley points out that the relevancy and appeal of The Millstone\u2019s is because it \u201cinsists that you can be an intelligent woman with a rich life of the mind, and have a baby, and that those two things are not going to be set in some sort of tragic opposition\u201d (\u201cThis Weekend\u201d).

Of special note are her iconic novels of the 1960s: in which, while still in her twenties, she established herself as one of the most literate and psychologically astute voices of her generation. The Millstone is her third novel, published in 1965 when the author was twenty-six. Rosamund Stacey, a young graduate student writing a thesis on the English Romantic poets, maintains a solitary and emotionally isolated existence in her parents' flat in London (her parents are living in Africa). Rigorously intellectual and self-aware, she\u2019s plotted out her neat and tidy life every step of the way. Even the romantic involvements she\u2019s permitted herself are planned and calculated for minimum fuss and muss: she goes on occasional outings to pubs and movies with two different men, neither of whom she finds particularly attractive and each of whom is under the impression she\u2019s sleeping with the other\u2014the result being that neither puts any pressure on her for a physical liaison or deeper commitment. But even Rosamund can\u2019t control forever her own desire for human connection, and one night she meets a man in a bar, gets tipsy, brings him to her flat, and they have sex. It\u2019s her one and only sexual encounter, and against the odds she discovers she\u2019s pregnant. It\u2019s at this point that her analytical approach to living breaks down and she begins questioning her motives and objectives. Reason dictates that she have an abortion and put the episode behind her. But almost without reaching the decision consciously, and without any help from her family and with very little from her friends, she foregoes this option and proceeds resolutely onward, making arrangements for the birth and for the presence in her life of someone who will depend on her for everything. Drabble\u2019s assured narrative\u2014first person from Rosamund\u2019s perspective\u2014is touching, thoroughly engrossing, psychologically penetrating, and sometimes very funny, as the middle-class intellectual in Rosamund struggles with feelings and passions that often take her by surprise, and is shocked again and again to discover how profoundly ignorant she is about life in the trenches. Drabble\u2019s voice in this book is refined and mature and never lets the reader down. Her later novels are longer and more complex, but by any measure The Millstone remains a literary accomplishment of the first order."}, {"userName": "Silvia", "userReviewDate": "Jun 24, 2016", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/14033884-silvia", "userReview": "Questo libro \u00e8 stato proprio una bella scoperta. \u00c8 stato prima di tutto un acquisto impulsivo fatto ad Hay-on-Wye, paesino gallese famoso per le tantissime librerie di seconda mano e per il festival del libro che si svolge l\u00ec ogni anno. Sono stata ad Hay-on-Wye una piovosa giornata di inizio aprile e ho fatto incetta di libri, e tra la decina che ho comprato c'era anche questo. Il motivo per cui l'ho comprato non \u00e8 molto nobile - volevo un libro Penguin degli anni '70 e ho scelto questo perch\u00e9 il nome dell'autrice era apparso una volta in un articolo che avevo letto. Ho avuto tempo di leggere questo libro solo ora e mi \u00e8 piaciuto tantissimo. Parla di una giovane ragazza, Rosamund, impegnata nella scrittura della sua tesi di dottorato che si accorge di essere rimasta incinta dopo la sua prima volta. Rosamund decide di portare avanti la gravidanza, nonostante non sia sposata e malgrado le critiche di alcuni amici e familiari.Secondo molte recensioni che ho letto qui il romanzo sarebbe datato, ma a me non ha fatto per nulla questa impressione. Se lo leggiamo tenendo in conto che comunque \u00e8 stato scritto negli anni '60, non ci pu\u00f2 non stupire l'argomento e non possiamo non immedesimarci in Rosamund, ragazza molto indipendente ma anche piena di dubbi e ossessionata dalla paura di disturbare le persone con qualsiasi richiesta. Credo che i libri vadano letti non per evidenziare le differenze con la nostra societ\u00e0 e con il nostro modo di pensare, ma per capire e meravigliarci soprattutto delle somiglianze. Del romanzo ho apprezzato molto l'argomento e i temi trattati (il raporto con amici, amanti, familiari; la vita accademica; il funzionamento del sistema sanitario etc.). Ho apprezzato anche lo stile di scrittura, semplice, delicato e ricco di riferimenti letterari.Libro assolutamente consigliato!"}, {"userName": "Hyowon", "userReviewDate": "Jul 06, 2016", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/54350370-hyowon", "userReview": "This was my first Drabble book, after having listened to BBC interview with the author on her many books. This book is short, has only a small number of characters, which I liked. The narrative of the main character, Rosamund Stacey, was very interesting, witty, touching and it has a few very memorable comments that she observes. I loved this book so much that I couldn't stop thinking about it once I read it; I had to re-read immediately after I finished. I continued repeatedly reading this book for 7 times within 2 months since first reading it - such a case is very unusual for me. Since 1997 when I first read it, I have read it over 15 times total over the next 10 years. In the early stage of my English practice, this book was especially great for having been written in very refined, correct and good English. I noted down many good sentences and memorised, mumbled and spoke wherever I went - it certainly helped me practice my English at the time. I particularly liked the main character's genuine and idealistic views of the world, her such honest narrations and comments on many situations. Her character intrigued me and attracted me immensely. I love a story like this where it's short, not many characters, thought-focused rather than incident-oriented. This will remain one of my favourite novels for many more years to come. Highly recommendable."}, {"userName": "Christopher", "userReviewDate": "May 25, 2015", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/8076015-christopher", "userReview": "\"The Millstone,\" published in 1965, must have been a startling novel for its time, given that its protagonist is a young woman who accidentally gets pregnant after her one and only experience with sexual intercourse and then decides to keep the child, with no plans to tell her one-time lover that he is the father. It's a book about finding oneself and about becoming an adult. At first, it's a trying read, since Rosamund - our narrator and heroine - seems so passive in the face of all aspects of her life. But then, through the very act of choosing not to act, she throws into question the lessons of her existence up to that point and learns, once there is someone other than herself for whom she is responsible, that there are sometimes more important concerns than one's own. It's a feminist parable for the upper middle class, since Rosamund gets to have her child and keep her life (she's a rising literary scholar), unlike many of the other women whose paths she crosses. The fact that Rosamund - raised as a Champagne Socialist - is increasingly aware of the disparities of class, is yet one more way that she redeems herself from the sin of self-involvement with which she begins the book. It's a fascinating read, if occasionally prone to unnecessary social caricature."}, {"userName": "Ameesha", "userReviewDate": "Feb 28, 2016", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/27556785-ameesha", "userReview": "A book club choice, this isn't a book I'd have normally picked up, especially with my edition's corny tagline, \"Rosamund is clever, very independent - and pregnant\". On the contrary, I found her highly intellectual and academically intelligent, but with little common sense or real-world knowledge. However, I found myself unexpectedly entertained. Drabble's writing style is distinct, and suits her protagonist's intellect well. The book is at times amusing, and despite the circumstances of an unmarried woman being pregnant in the 60s, it was neither moralising nor depressing. Instead, it was a matter-of-fact,unintentionally soul-searching, character story that seemed to fully embody the British spirit of \"just getting on with it\".

Quintessential \u200escholar with not-so-great social skills gets pregnant by accident and is too shy, unassertive, and possibly conflicted, to terminate it in the early stages. Will she or won't she? Will she get dismissed from her position? Will she ever tell the father? Or even her own father?I'm not telling. It sounds like a good little mystery but it's more--it's an introspection. And quite a good one. In the progress of her problem, she comes out of her private little world and observes the people around her, which adds a little picture of time and place made quite interesting by her unique perspective. The British Healthcare system seems amazing for its efficiency. I suppose rich people have private physicians, but the rest of us just go to the clinic. I'll admit she had a little trouble finding here to go from there, but at least she didn't have to manage ten different referrals and in-network/out-of-network claim forms."}, {"userName": "NancyHelen", "userReviewDate": "Apr 07, 2014", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/1215302-nancyhelen", "userReview": "It is the mark of a great author, that she can write a novel about something as simple as a woman falling pregnant by accident and having a baby, and it be so compelling. The narrator, Rosamund, is so real. Her self-awareness, including her flaws and failings, are incredibly endearing. I am not sure I would have appreciated this book quite as much if I hadn't of had children myself but it was just so delicately written, I couldn't put it down. The emotion was quite overwhelming at times. I thank goodness I live in a more enlightened time, as the physical pain I felt when Rosamund was officiously told that she wasn't allowed to visit her own daughter in hospital was horrific. I am sure that there were apparently valid reasons for such rules, but in hindsight they are nothing short of inhumane and cruel. But it showed how Rosamund had developed from the beginning of the book through to the end and how a small child could have such a profound effect on her personality."}, {"userName": "Lucie Novak", "userReviewDate": "Jun 05, 2014", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/29972501-lucie-novak", "userReview": "I remember reading it as a young woman.

It's kind of like the flip side of the supposedly \"liberated\" sexuality that you get from the typical sixties novel by Updike, Roth, and Mailer. The main character is a Renaissance literature scholar who becomes pregnant after her first misbegotten sexual encounter. The rest of the novel follows her struggle as she decides to have the baby on her own without telling the father. The parts which describe her battles with Britain's National Health system and some disapproving nurses may seem dated, but they are a fascinating reminder at how far sexual attitudes have come in the last fifty years."}, {"userName": "Saravana Kumar", "userReviewDate": "Oct 23, 2015", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/39751049-saravana-kumar", "userReview": "Rosamund Stacey is a kind of girl who believes that nothing in life really last.

But one gets engaged with the story during her last few months of pregnancy and the delivery.The best part of this book comes when Rosamund delivers Octavia.
