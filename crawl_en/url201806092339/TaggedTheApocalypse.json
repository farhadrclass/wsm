I've bought this one, it's on my Kindle and ready to go. The reviews have been awesome. But I've been burnt by good reviews before. We'll see. I'll update.Dear Lord. Am I condemned to start every review with a exclamation of disbelief at how, yet again, I've been fooled into reading such utter garbage? Five stars? How could anyone give this book 5 stars? Are they confused by the rating system? Can they actually read?I guess I've been spoilt by starting reading zombie books with the brilliant World War Z. It doesn't come much better than that (not the abortion of a movie). But seriously, this book is just confusing. Who? What? Why? Oh, I don't care. All the characters are universally horrible. It starts with a very unpleasant middle age couple having sex. Graphically. Now, I'm hardly one to shy away from such things. I write graphic sex scenes (albeit with entirely different body parts) but this was just prurient, pornographic. We have't been introduced to these people so why are we in their hotel bedroom whilst they have sex? Bad form.So, anyway, thinking their story might have some tiny relevance to the storyline I was confused when they both died in the next chapter. Okay... Oh, there was a funny bit -- unintentionally, I assume. Teenage daughter finds her mother turned into a zombie in the hallway (lion mane, long claws, living skeleton with fangs) and calls out, \"What's happened to Mom?\" Tee hee. You can't beat writing like that.So, then we have a scene with some religious zealots thrashing themselves. Who? What? Why? Oh, I don't care.Then we have some survivors in a nuclear plant but they all get murdered by drug dealers. Who? What?... oh, you get the picture.What an utter load of trash. Written to be made into a movie as far as I can see--lots of graphic descriptions of the gore and vomit and blood and lots of screaming. Fortunately I only paid 70p for this. Even that was a waste of money."}, {"userName": "Ben", "userReviewDate": "May 02, 2018", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/81545194-ben", "userReview": "This author should be brought up on federal charges for fraud.

This is officially thee worst I have ever, EVER read in my life. I've tried to find more info on the author, for example, his age because I cannot believe a grown adult would or could even manage to spew out such utter sh*te like it! I could just about laugh towards the end at how badly written it was. I wish I could give it no stars but no joy!My all time favourite lines: 'They were dead before they hit the ground. They were dead after they hit the ground. Dead, dead, dead.'Every character in this f*ckwit of a read is so insulting to human kind. Sven, who sounds like an upturned mop with zero skills other than getting high. Candy, a dancer turned madam running a brothel because apparently sex is currency now..? A lesbian or not, it isn't stated but a predator of younger girls none the less because of course the writers only known function for women at the end of days is for sex. Thank you Joseph Chiron, you insulting pr*ck. Alexis for her 'men are so weak' statement after giving a guy a bj for info. Again, has the writer read too many Jackie Collins books?! The only gay guy we know of of course is a wimp but with great fashion sense, because the writer has clearly never met a homosexual in his life so sticks with the cliches he knows of.A f*cking rabbit called bugs."}, {"userName": "Waddill", "userReviewDate": "Feb 11, 2015", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/40064873-waddill", "userReview": "This book is terrible.

The plot was mind-numbingly limited meaning 'inside the boxed-thinking', lacking in any originality. It was a mixing of several already done to death plot ideas.Zero character development. What you see is what you get. There was an absence of character growth (character arc). The characters are pretty AMORAL. The women are presented as little more than sex objects. In fact there wasn't as single character in this book that I could get behind and cheer for.The settings in this book was one seriously testosterone rich environment after the next. Where the men are savages, brutes, drug addicts, rapists and so on. There were so many factual inaccuracies put into the settings that I finally came to the conclusion that this must have been done for some still unknown purpose.I can not tell you why the book is titled Tagged. Yes there are a few references to \"tagging\", placing a microchip inside ones body for identification, but these are fleeting. They are not the subject of the plot or the cause of the apocalypse.There are other subplots in this book as well which turned out to be more of a random concept tossed in there, then an actual part of the story, such as religious zealots who went around flogging themselves preaching the end is near.

I'm not saying it's horrible, as it's a quick read and keeps you wanting to find out what happens, but it's nowhere near astounding. I found quite a few things lacking, which was mostly the sense of attachment to characters. Then others had no depth whatsoever, even if you're reading their viewpoints. I felt detached from mostly everyone, except the dog. lol. Don't get me wrong, it's not a terrible read, but coming from someone who's read many zombie/apocolypse stories, this doesn't come close in comparison to other stories in the genre. The As the World Dies trilogy by Rhiannon Frater will always be my favorite zombie read, so I have high standards.

At the 45% mark and sixty-eight unique issues, I couldn\u2019t go on. This is an action packed, zombie thriller, but it actually has too much action and death. I lost count how many times people were vomiting, popping blisters or leaking black goo out of every orifice. It was just too much. I didn\u2019t feel the characters were rounded. They were all screaming. Granted when the walking dead are coming after your, I understand their reactions, but even during the few lulls, they are still screaming at each other. There are too many sentences that need to be rewritten because of missing words or bad punctuation. Readers shouldn\u2019t have to guess what word the author meant to say. I believe many of these issues can be cleared up with minimal effort. I enjoyed the setting and how those who were still human were attempting to hold out. For what, I don\u2019t know in that the power plant is completely surrounded by hundreds or thousands, if not millions of the walking dead. Perhaps one day, I\u2019ll finish it. Today is not the day.

Again, that's saying a lot.Things I enjoyed about this book:- Sven the pot-growing, dreadlocked hippy with the Dr. Doolittle pet menagerie. - Candy and her girls. nicely done- Fairly unique zombie outbreak scenario. The opening sequence of hot, B-A-H-A-M-A-S love was definitely attention getting.- The setting of the nuclear reactor. There were some elemnts in the book, however, that seemed almost thrown in, like a mish-mash of parts that are sewn together to create a whole, but, like Frankenstein's monster, they don't seem to gel enough not to show the scars and stitching. For example, universal tagging, DNA beauty treatments that lead to leonine zombies, the supervolcanic explosion of Yosemite, the religious flagellants, are all thrown together in the opening sequences of the book. All of this seemed too rushed and hurried to be introduced in the beginning, particularly if the author doesn't use most of these ideas unhe til much, much later. If there will be a sequel to the book, why not wait a little bit? Why a supervolcanic eruption? For the lights to go out and make the zombies scarier? I don't buy it, and it seemed kind of thrown in. If there were such a catastrophic event, then the consequences to California, where the story takes place, would have been much more drastic than are depicted here. This part didn't feel real to me.Having rambled all that, however, I must say I truly enjoyed this story and would recommend it to fans of horror, post-apocalytic, zombies, or just lovers of a rousing good tale.

The quality of the writing was very good. The introduction was gripping and I loved the unique spin that Joseph Chiron put on the initial zombie infection. The book was packed with action. Even the zombies were uniquely designed. I am a huge fan of zombies in general and was very pleased to see this break away from some of the redundant, overdone themes that persist in many zombie books.The only issues I had with this novel were minor. I thought the middle of this book felt too distant from the ending and the beginning, where it was pulled together. I also felt that some descriptions were overwritten (mostly regarding the zombies themselves... after being told how they looked and smelt half a dozen times or more, I didn't see a great need to continually describe them to me).I really enjoyed this novel, though, even with some minor issues.

I also found the dialogue a little confusing and found myself have to re-read sections to find out who said what. I thought that the authors style of writing a little repetitive, describing the \u201cbeasts\u201d over and over again, and often using the same descriptive terms within a page or two.
