What he really wanted to do was support himself with his fiction. Already a fan of western movies, Leonard discovered he could get paid while he learned his craft by trafficking short pieces in a genre that was enormously popular on newsstands, as he recounts in the foreword, \"from Saturday Evening Post and Collier's down through Argosy, Adventure, Blue Book, and probably at least a dozen pulp magazines, the better ones like Dime Western and Zane Grey Magazine paying two cents a word.\"Leonard is a writer whose craft and facility with dialogue (as well as black, Hispanic and female characters) are qualities I've long admired. I'm not a big fan of the crime stories he'd become world famous for cranking out in the '80s and '90s, many of which fell into formula and self-parody. As for a gaggle of pulp westerns written during the Eisenhower administration, I expected them to be rigid and silly, full of good guys wearing white, bad guys in black and shrieking women tied up on train tracks.The Complete Western Stories of Elmore Leonard is a treasure trove, a Christmas gift for lovers of pulp fiction. Thirty short stories, twenty-seven of them published during the '50s, are included, three of which Hollywood would get hold of: Three-Ten to Yuma (released as 3:10 to Yuma in 1957 and 2007), The Captives (released as The Tall T in 1957) and Only Good Ones (released as Valdez Is Coming in 1971). Each short story is prefaced by their original titles -- if an editor opted for a more sensational one at publication -- as well as the magazine they appeared in and date. My favorites:The Big Hunt (original title: Matt Gordon's Boy) in which buffalo hunter Will Gordon is victimized by some unscrupulous men who once took advantage of Will's father in the same manner. After losing his hides to these men, young Will devises a novel plan for getting his valuables back.The Boy Who Smiled in which an Apache named Mickey Segundo watches his father lynched for a crime he didn't commit. Years later, working as an unassuming guide by the name Peza-a, Mickey is contracted by his father's killers to lead them on a hunting party.Saint with a Six-Gun (original title: The Hanging of Bobby Valdez) in which Lyall Quinlan gets his break in law enforcement when hired to guard incarcerated gunman Bobby Valdez the week leading up to Valdez's hanging. Both sides of the law underestimate the green youngster.The Longest Day In His Life in which Steve Brady spends his first day on the job as a stageline rep being robbed of his new suit and gun, being drawn on with a shotgun by the daughter of a business client, being recognized by a bandit he shot and testified against seven years ago and proposing marriage to the woman who almost shot him earlier.The Kid (original title: The Gift of Regalo) in which an opportunistic horse trainer finds a mute Indian boy and decides to keep him as an indentured servant, until a young prospector determines the boy was stolen by Apaches at one time and now deserves humane treatment, even if it means shooting the kid's master.Even this early in his career, Leonard demonstrates a sharp ear for character and dialogue. These aren't stories about some guy in a hat and something happens to him(!), but a guy in a hat who was a certain sort of man (!) and something happens to him. With this focus on character, I was invested in even the average stories. The historical detail is impeccable. Leonard specialized in a very specific place and time: the Arizona Territory of the 1880s. Cavalry garrisons, stagecoach runs and Apache resistance offer a different look and feel than most westerns; it's war territory, not the stock landscape of the wild west town. At 528 pages, this mother lode took me two weeks to finish, but the stories are bite sized and a couple of them can fit into your commute or lunch break. If you don't cotton to the pulp western, or to the Elmore Leonard of Get Shorty, I recommend giving these pieces a try. Not every story is a keeper, but Leonard delivers what I crack open fiction for in the first place: vivid landscape, terse storytelling, character, dialogue and social justice."}, {"userName": "Jim", "userReviewDate": "Feb 10, 2012", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/695116-jim", "userReview": "This is an abridged version of the book having only 11 stories in it. I don't think they're abridged, though. Read by Tom Wopath, Henry Rollins & David Strather & William Atherton. (I wrote those names down as I heard them. I have no idea if they're spelled correctly, but all of them were excellent readers.)For some reason, I never equated Elmore Leonard with westerns. I'd forgotten who wrote Hombre. It's been a lot of years since I read the book, though I've probably watched the movie with Paul Newman in it a dozen times over the years & it is an old favorite.One of the best things about Leonard's writing is that everyone in them are real people. Good/bad, black/white/red, male/female, they're not perfect in any way. They're strong, opinionated, & have reasons for being what they are. They get dealt a hand & play it out, often based on a past that is painted in with broad strokes, just enough to give them depth, but with enough detail left out for some wiggle room. I was never quite sure which way they'd go, but usually the author seemed to find a pretty unique path for them.Blood Money - 3.5 stars - A good solid story to start the ball rolling. Typically well written & gritty about a bank robbery & what happens after. Exactly what I'd expect from Leonard.Only Good Ones - Wow! 5 stars, a story of prejudice & vigilantism so unbelievable, but so starkly written that it felt true. Surely it was too stark & outrageous to be mere fictionTrail of the Apache - 4 stars - another solid story with a bit more meat than the first. Government treatment of Indians & a pretty exceptional man that carried the orders out. There's duty, there's dedication, & then there is just being built a certain way. Add them together & Leonard came up with a very remarkable hero. Trouble at Rindo Station - 3 stars. Not bad, but pretty similar on a lot of points to the other stories. If I hadn't just heard them, I probably would have rated it a bit higher.The Boy Who Smiled - 3 stars. Serviceable & would have been more chilling if everything hadn't been telegraphed so far ahead.The Tonto Woman - 4 stars. I loved the characters & the ending. It's not what I would expect from Leonard at all, but I loved it. It's the kind of story that makes you think about it after it's done.Hurrah for Captain Early - 3 stars, maybe 4, but it could have been 5 & blew it. This was an excellent story in a lot of ways, but it got too scattered, tried to make too many points & wound up not really making any of them with the impact they deserved. Still, it wound up being a disappointment.The Colonel's Lady - 4 stars - Wow! Great action with a great ending. I can't say more without a spoiler, unfortunately. I won't even post a spoiler, just tell you that you have to read it without knowing what is going to happen for the impact. Go read it now. Seriously. It's too cool not to.Saint With A Six Gun - 4 stars. This is an excellent story where a young man learns some of the facts of life the hard way, but with a superb twist. It was thought provoking, but had a really fun twist, too.You Never See Apaches - 3 stars. Not particularly interesting over all, but it does show Indians in a very good light. It was too obvious in most ways.3:10 to Yuma - 3 stars. A much shorter story than I expected, so it didn't have the history of the movies which added to the impact. Basically, it's the last scene of the movies - sort of - just the walk from the hotel to the train.This is definitely a 'must read' western collection. Highly recommended."}, {"userName": "Andy", "userReviewDate": "Jul 20, 2012", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/764075-andy", "userReview": "In the 1950s there were two major figures in western noir; one was filmmaker Anthony Mann and the other was writer Elmore Leonard. Leonard's writing was so dark that several western magazines turned down his stories for that very reason. In this excellent collection of stories you get frontier femme fatales like \"The Colonel's Lady\", tales of Injun justice in \"The Big Hunt\" and a young Mexican seeking revenge in \"The Boy Who Smiled\". The latter two stories mentioned are significant in that they address issues of racism amid a cowboy style setting, making it less didactic than any sermon.While I never cared much for Leonard's modern crime writing I find his western tales to be totally tall and badass in the saddle."}, {"userName": "Randy", "userReviewDate": "Feb 21, 2011", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/1344551-randy", "userReview": "In the introduction, Elmore Leonard states that when he decided he wanted to be a writer, after college, he chose a genre he could learn to write while getting paid. Since he liked westerns, that's what he chose to start.Of course it wasn't that easy.His first effort was rejected and he decided a little research might be handy. His aim was for the higher paying magazines, Saturday Evening Post and Colliers. There were also a half dozen pulp magazines still in existence. There his early success was found.Leonard expressed a liking for the American southwest and the Apache, not caring much for the high plains tribes. His first half dozen or so tales mixed the Apache with Union soldiers, various situations which turned a number of stereotypes on their ears. One, the green officer fresh out of West Point sure if he went by the rules, he could defeat those \"savages.\" They are there to be sure, but a bit smarter in most cases.Thirty stories in the collection, all but a few written and published in the early to mid-fifties. The last few spread out from the sixties to the nineties. 3:10 TO YUMA is here(made into two excellent movies with only minor changes to the story), The Captives(made into the film THE TALL T), and Only Good Ones which he later expanded into the novel Valdez is Coming!(made into the film starring Burt Lancaster).Most early in his writing career, one can see the developing style and his way of putting the reader square into the story: the sweltering heat of the southwest desert country, the prejudices, and the valiant people of all stripe.A most excellent collection."}, {"userName": "Jamie", "userReviewDate": "Feb 04, 2012", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/51089-jamie", "userReview": "\u201cThree-Ten to Yuma,\u201d still one of my favorites.

This is particularly interesting as you hear how he got started as a writer and how he had to manage having a full-time job, a family and pursue his dreams. Since Leonard's style has evolved quite a bit, it's interesting to hear about his aspirations as a young writer.Trail of the Apache - 1951I wasn't sure what to expect of this first story, Leonard first published piece of writing, and I was somewhat surprised by it. Because of the decade, 1950s and watching reruns of \"The Rifleman,\" \"Bonanza,\" and other TV westerns from that era, I expected a sedate, perhaps lighthearted tale of the Wild West with macho cowboys and politically uncorrect, if not stereotypical portrayals of Native Americans and instead I read a modern and sympathetic description of the Apache Native Americans and how bureaucracy can make a mess of their lives. While the story starts off slow, it is all a setup for a turn of events, a build up to some unexpected violence, a scene that is almost brutal in it's description, that really pulled you emotionally into the story. I was really surprised by this scene, and you can see the beginnings of how Elmore Leonard would later experiment with the genre, an ability to prod and pull at a genre's boundaries, something he'd pull off with greater accomplishment in his later westerns and especially when he transitioned later to the crime genre."}, {"userName": "Liralen", "userReviewDate": "Jun 07, 2012", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/1601513-liralen", "userReview": "I loved this collection, inside and out.There are some really gorgeous tales in here, and some really amazingly brutal and entirely historical stories of the old old West. Elmore Leeonard's dialog is razor sharp and ONLY what needs to be there. I love the progression through these as well, as he hits his stride and the 3:10 to Yuma is just absolutely perfect.There are stories in here to break your heart, to figure out what real courage really is, and with the lovely plot twists that are utterly and beautifully character driven. I've always loved many of the Leonard villains as much as the heroes in the derived movies and TV series, and I find that they're just as personable and driven by their own circumstances and needs in these stories, if not more so.Oddly enough what I treasure most about this treasury is one of the reasons I also love the Damon Runyon omnibus: While there are a few utterly brilliant stories that leave me in utter awe and despair of ever touching something that perfect in my writing, the others are really good but are not that penultimate expression of the form.

I remember reading this while waiting for my car to get fixed, with other people present in the waiting room, and I had to actively suppress saying out loud \"Dat's cool!\" when something cool happened.Now, this almost visceral reaction happened about three pages into a story. Let it be a testament to the efficiency of Leonard's writing that I had, in three pages or less, gotten such an affinity for the characters and situation presented that I had to bite my tongue not to embarrass myself in public.Leonard is no Tolkien (thankfully), but, for a writer who appreciates terseness and getting to the point, he was also surprisingly good at sketching landscapes, an inescapable factor in a good western story. After the first few shorts, I was thoroughly ingrained in the Arizona pecos and mountain ranges.Another surprisingly positive thing -- especially for shorts mostly published in the 50s -- is how damn progressive Leonard was when it came to race and gender.

In addition to some noir, I thought it would be fun to do Westerns; since I'm not particularly well-versed in them, I thought it would be a good opportunity to edumacte myself. So I immediately reached for the Elmore. I've been enjoying the stories, which aren't as formulaic as you might expect. Of course, there's a lot of repetition, but it tends mainly to be in the description (the word \"ramada\" gets used over and over) as opposed to the action. There are many clever turns of plot in various entries that help us understanding why this stuff was so entertaining fifty/sixty years ago. I imagine most students will be interested in \"Three-Ten to Yuma,\" which is really only a sliver of the movie---and not necessarily the meat of that flick, either. There's also a nice introduction here that makes it clear that Leonard TRAINED himself to write through these pieces.

By the end of the collection, his focus was more on the story than the description of the scene. And I appreciate his research into his subject area. My Arizona friends might like this collection.

According to the introduction, Mr. Leonard\u2019s first attempt was not very good and was rejected, whereupon he decided that next time he would do his research first. He focused on the Arizona Territory, because that part of the country had a strong draw for him, and he liked the Apaches best of the various tribes of Native Americans.This volume presents the bulk of the stories in order of publication, rather than when they were written. Thus it begins with Elmore Leonard\u2019s first published work, \u201cTrail of the Apache.\u201d Indian agent Travisin does his best to keep his Apache charges peaceful and moderately satisfied. He keeps his wits sharp through a bet with his lead scout Gatito that if the other man can ever touch his knife to Travisin\u2019s back, he will win a bottle of whiskey. For the last two years, Gatito has not had alcohol.The trouble arrives with Travisin\u2019s new trainee, Lieutenant De Both. De Both himself is a decent enough fellow, though green in the ways of the West. But he\u2019s escorting a band of Apache from another reservation, led by the renegade Pillo. The Army, in its infinite wisdom, has decided that Pillo and his rowdy comrades should be separated from their wives and families on Travisin\u2019s reservation to calm them down.To no one\u2019s surprise, Pillo and his men are soon off the reservation with Gatito, and looking to gather other renegades to restart the Indian Wars. It\u2019s up to Travisin, De Bolt, and the tracker known as Fry to stop them.By the end of the 1950s, the pulp magazines had died, and the market for short Westerns had dried up. Mr. Leonard switched to primarily doing crime stories (You may remember Get Shorty.) But every so often, a Western collection would ask him to contribute, so there\u2019s not quite a handful of such late stories. The last one published was \u201cHurrah for Captain Early!\u201d which takes place in a small Arizona town which is having a return celebration for its hometown hero of the recent Spanish-American War.The main character is Bo Catlett, a cavalryman who also served in the war. But since Mr. Catlett is black, there are those who don\u2019t believe that he\u2019s a veteran. In fact, they don\u2019t believe that Mr. Catlett should be in town at all. And possibly not breathing. But Sergeant Major Bo Catlett has something to return to Captain Early, and maybe it would be okay if there was a little blood of an ignorant fool on it.Like the other late-period stories, this one contains strong language that wasn\u2019t allowed in the magazines, as well as the period racism. Taking place in the twilight of the Old West, it\u2019s a suitable and somewhat cynical endpiece.Of special interest to movie fans are the stories \u201cThree-Ten to Yuma\u201d and \u201cThe Captives\u201d (which became The Tall T.) Both were considerably expanded from their original short format. In the former tale, a deputy marshal tries to get his prisoner aboard the title train with them both still alive despite their respective enemies. In the latter, a rancher who\u2019s lost his horse hitches a ride aboard a stagecoach\u2013which is promptly captured by outlaws, and he must use his wits to keep himself and at least one other passenger alive. Both are exciting and suspenseful.Mr. Leonard was no stranger to dark humor, the best example of this in the current volume being \u201cCavalry Boots\u201d in which a cowardly deserter becomes honored as the hero of a battle. Mostly because he\u2019s not around to dispute it, but partially because he accidentally did save the day.This edition has an extra story at the end, \u201cThe Treasure of Mungo\u2019s Landing\u201d, which wasn\u2019t in the first edition because it couldn\u2019t be proved it existed. Tracking down clues, it was discovered to have been printed under the wrong author\u2019s name (Leonard Elmore) and in a different magazine than believed. The story itself is a nice tale of a man who discovers a robbery is about to be committed, and stops it only to be accused of the crime himself. The bad guy would have gotten away if he hadn\u2019t let his greed and gloating get away with his common sense.It\u2019s thirty-one fine stories in all, ranging from talented newcomer quality to very good. There\u2019s period depiction of Native Americans (not usually entirely negative) and some period sexism (plus a couple of attempted rapes.)Recommended for Western fans, Elmore Leonard fans and fans of the TV series Justified, which was based on Mr. Leonard\u2019s work."}, {"userName": "Warren Stalley", "userReviewDate": "Mar 25, 2018", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/23659531-warren-stalley", "userReview": "The Complete Western Stories gathers together thirty Elmore Leonard short yet impressive stories.

There are weary rangers, ruthless Apaches, scout riders, military cavalry, bank robbers, gold seekers, cattle barons and scheming cowboys all mixed into the dust and blazing heat of the prairies. These are truly gripping stories with action and drama where tough loners with honourable moral codes make solemn decisions about life and death in the blazing heat of day and the freezing chill of night where any sound could be danger or destiny. This collection includes the truly electrifying 3.10 to Yuma \u2013 a lean and word-perfect piece that shows the sheer power of author Elmore Leonard within a classic short story format. Each story has its own individual merit and worth. Some even go beyond the Western genre such as The Man with the Iron Arm and delve into deeper subjects such as sexism and racism, making for truly fascinating reading. This collection also features the origin stories of later full-length novels and films such as The Tall T and Valdez is Coming.

However, I thought it was really enjoyable to see how Elmore Leonard diversified his characters and plots within the Western genre as his writing went on.

Overall I just felt the collection was too much a roller coaster of quality to say I had a positive time overall. There were definitely some highlights but the book overall seemed to take forever to finish because I would run into one long lone that was not very interesting and slogged through it. I would say only for dedicated Leonard and Western readers."}, {"userName": "Joseph Carrabis", "userReviewDate": "Aug 30, 2017", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/47112679-joseph-carrabis", "userReview": "I read Leonard's Western Stories because I wanted something out of \"my genre\" and been told he was a master craftsperson along the lines of Hemingway and Hammett. Plus I'm a big fan of Justified and read Fire in the Hole. Good advice all around as Leonard is, indeed, a master whose sparcity of language is a learning experience in itself."}, {"userName": "Brooks", "userReviewDate": "Jul 03, 2017", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/5097271-brooks", "userReview": "Lots & lots of very similar characters in very similar landscapes with similar story-lines - perhaps not surprising for complete compilation.

And no story about a young writer struggling to launch his career ever matched its subject matter better than the tale behind Leonard's Western oeuvre.In 1950, fresh out of college -- having written two \"pointless\" stories, as he describes them -- Leonard decided he needed to pick a market, a big one, which would give him a better chance to be published while he learned to write. In choosing between crime and Westerns, the latter had an irresistible pull -- Leonard loved movies set in the West. As he researched deeper into settings, Arizona in the 1880s captured his imagination: the Spanish influence, the standoffs and shootouts between Apache Indians and the U.S. cavalry ...His first dozen stories sold for 2 cents a word, for $100 each. The rest is history.This first-ever complete collection of Leonard's thirty Western tales will thrill lovers of the genre, his die-hard fans, and everyone in between -- and makes a terrific study of the launch of a phenomenal career.From his very first story ever published -- \"The Trail of the Apache\" -- through five decades of classic Western tales, The Complete Western Stories of Elmore Leonard demonstrates again and again the superb talent for language and gripping narrative that has made Leonard one of the most acclaimed and influential writers of our time.", "title": "The Complete Western Stories of Elmore Leonard", "url": "https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/85222.The_Complete_Western_Stories_of_Elmore_Leonard", "average": 4.12, "cover": "https://images.gr-assets.com/books/1407106187l/85222.jpg", "reviews": 135, "authors": [{"url": "https://www.goodreads.com/author/show/12940.Elmore_Leonard", "name": "Elmore Leonard"}], "type": ["Westerns", "Short Stories", "Fiction", "Historical"], "outlinks": ["http://www.goodreads.com/book/show/85222.The_Complete_Western_Stories_of_Elmore_Leonard", "http://www.goodreads.com/book/show/173983.The_Complete_Western_Stories_of_Elmore_Leonard", "http://www.goodreads.com/book/show/594963.The_Complete_Western_Stories_of_Elmore_Leonard", "http://www.goodreads.com/book/show/6621665-the-complete-western-stories-of-elmore-leonard", "http://www.goodreads.com/book/show/13483753-tutti-i-racconti-western", "http://www.goodreads.com/book/show/19185446-the-complete-western-stories", "http://www.goodreads.com/book/show/9898613-the-complete-western-stories-of-elmore-leonard", "http://www.goodreads.com/book/show/702539.Get_Shorty", "http://www.goodreads.com/book/show/288962.Out_of_Sight", "http://www.goodreads.com/book/show/147210.Tishomingo_Blues", "http://www.goodreads.com/book/show/240910.Rum_Punch", "http://www.goodreads.com/book/show/288995.52_Pickup", "http://www.goodreads.com/book/show/39928984-mercy-among-the-children", "http://www.goodreads.com/book/show/20620995-take-me-with-you", "http://www.goodreads.com/book/show/6565401-five-quarters-of-the-orange", "http://www.goodreads.com/book/show/25600623-the-diver-s-clothes-lie-empty", "http://www.goodreads.com/book/show/18867378-the-traveler-s-gift", "http://www.goodreads.com/book/show/40198373-big-stone-gap", "http://www.goodreads.com/book/show/40198387-friendship-bread", "http://www.goodreads.com/book/show/40193401-the-little-giant-of-aberdeen-county", "http://www.goodreads.com/book/show/35963775-her-sister-s-shoes", "http://www.goodreads.com/book/show/22617980-the-rock-harbor-collection", "http://www.goodreads.com/book/show/35269080-a-thousand-tomorrows", "http://www.goodreads.com/book/show/40204902-caravans", "http://www.goodreads.com/book/show/31192689-shoeless-joe", "http://www.goodreads.com/book/show/40204877-a-hero-of-france", "http://www.goodreads.com/book/show/6473113-death-in-venice", "http://www.goodreads.com/book/show/40266651-the-tilted-world", "http://www.goodreads.com/book/show/33117501-blonde", "http://www.goodreads.com/book/show/36546758-ever-after", "http://www.goodreads.com/book/show/40193580-rescue", "http://www.goodreads.com/book/show/22032837-the-pearl-that-broke-its-shell", "http://www.goodreads.com/book/show/36589911-the-lords-of-discipline", "http://www.goodreads.com/book/show/11963271-the-sheltering-sky", "http://www.goodreads.com/book/show/25596951-the-dressmaker-s-war", "http://www.goodreads.com/book/show/35120598-gena-finn", "http://www.goodreads.com/book/show/29550710-a-charles-martin-collection", "http://www.goodreads.com/book/show/19977229-remember-tuesday-morning", "http://www.goodreads.com/book/show/8530701-a-town-like-alice", "http://www.goodreads.com/book/show/35414455-the-other-alcott", "http://www.goodreads.com/book/show/18800554-the-scavenger-s-daughters", "http://www.goodreads.com/book/show/40205036-under-the-udala-trees", "http://www.goodreads.com/book/show/32861105-the-streets-have-no-king", "http://www.goodreads.com/book/show/39929534-the-passion", "http://www.goodreads.com/book/show/35654710-this-dark-road-to-mercy", "http://www.goodreads.com/book/show/11513574-breath-eyes-memory", "http://www.goodreads.com/book/show/21942189-the-language-of-hoofbeats", "http://www.goodreads.com/book/show/18165412-house-of-bathory", "http://www.goodreads.com/book/show/37984397-we-own-the-sky", "http://www.goodreads.com/book/show/36004055-not-perfect"]}
