In fact many of his paintings would feature this farm, where he would visit and paint in the summers for twenty years, a farm that Christina's family had owned and lived in for generations. Cushing, Maine, how the family came here and whom there ancestors were is an interesting back story in itself.Although Wyeth makes an appearance here and there, for the most part this is the story of Christina, her family and her life. After almost dying as a child of an undiagnosed illness, her legs would never be right, twisted, making her stumble as she walked. As she aged the effects of this illness, maybe undiagnosed polio, would get much worse leaving her with a shrinking world. Wonderfully written we are immersed in the life of this farm, the changing seasons, the never-ending chores and into the heart of a young woman. At times Christina is hard to like, having had a slim chance of a life outside of the farm, it is taken from her by an act of cowardice, something she resented and could never forget. She is often bitter, frustrated, and often seems too proud. Struggling though she is, she does not want anyone's pity nor their help. Going back and forth we see how a young Betsy, who will become Wyeth's wife, is introduced into her life, later bringing Wyeth. Wyeth will bring bit of color and life into Christina and her brothers Al's world on the farm. Another fantastic, and touching story by this author. Bringing to life the story behind a painting and the life of a young girl who always wanted more than she was given, but accomplished so much despite her handicap. Someone who, would eventually make peace with her handicap and grow to appreciate the beauty of the place she lived.

I was aching at times for Christina. This was a gut wrenching sad story. I shed tears a couple of times - and found myself thankful for a relief of the 'smallest' gesture-of-expression-of sibling-love. The touch of a hand between Christina and her brother, Al, was one of the most beautiful moments in this novel to me. There were a couple other 'golden box' beautiful scenes that helped balance the grief & bitterness. Author Christina Baker Kline created a highly imaginative FICTIONAL MEMOIR. This would make an excellent book club pick ( Sara and I are buddy- chatting this together), as there is so much the reader wants to talk about. - Many themes to explore:  .....A discussion about the famous painting: \"Christina's World\", by Andrew Wyeth .....The history of the Hathorn/Olson house in Cushing Maine .....Christina's lifelong suffering - possibly Charcot-Marie-Tooth disease - affected EACH family member. Shame, resentment, lost dreams, family challenges, social class, are some of the themes & issues explored. This novel grapples with real questions that are difficult to answer.  \"I think of my mother opening her front door to a Swedish sailor, the stuff of fairytales: Repunzel letting down her hair, Cinderella sliding her foot into the glass slipper, Sleeping Beauty awaiting a kiss. All were given one chance to step into a happily ever after \u2013 \u2013 or at least must've seemed that way. But was it the prince who attracted them, or merely the opportunity for escape?

I was surprised by how much I liked it and how very readable it was! I found it very hard to put down.I was not familiar with Andrew Wyeth or his famous painting entitled Christina's World but it made for an excellent story. Poor stubborn Christina with her deformed limbs and constant pain was nevertheless a wonderful character. As the book progressed I began to wonder how on earth the author was going to arrive at any conclusion without completely devastating the reader. The author turned out to be much cleverer than me:)My copy of this book came from my library and I was the first person to borrow it. So I read from a nice shiny copy with a beautiful cover depicting the house from the story.

It is here where he first met Christina Olson who later becomes the inspiration for his painting \u201cChristina\u2019s World\u201d. Christina lived a tough life along with her brother Al on the neighboring farm. Their dilapidated home lacked modern day conveniences and had fallen into disrepair. Andrew encounters the Olsons through their neighbor Betsy and he decides to express their lives via a painting. As Andrew puts paint to canvas, the details of the Olson\u2019s hardships come to light. The story unfolds with Christina\u2019s as a young girl. A childhood illness left her with difficulty walking and no cure for her bone disease. As she grew older, the effects worsened leaving her crippled making her farm chores difficult. A bright student, the opportunity to further her studies to become a teacher were dismissed early by her parents. Her future only left her with two choices, to marry or maintain the farm. Sadly, she had very few opportunities to make romantic connections leaving her with no escape. Christina is not the most likable character, but by reading the book you become sympathetic to her disposition. Andrew Wyeth developed a relationship with her over many years and was able to capture a different side of her in this painting. Andrew Wyeth painted the portrait, but the author writes a beautiful story by bringing it to life. Intertwined in the story is how she met Wyeth, who through his masterpiece, shows the world her softer side of someone having suffered so much both internally and externally. The author showcases a very moving and impactful novel.Book giveaway on my blog until 2/24 https://www.facebook.com/suzyapproved..."}, {"userName": "Linda", "userReviewDate": "Mar 11, 2017", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/9472704-linda", "userReview": "\"I wanted to show.......both the desire and the hesitation.\"You know it well. It's the famous painting by Andrew Wyeth in which a young girl's image is set within the Maine landscape of house, of barn, and of an ocean of endless grass. Wyeth seems to reveal nothing as he casts her likeness from behind. Yet, her thinly posed arms are stretched outward in familiar motion. This is, indeed, Christina's World.Generation after generation of the Hathorne clan have lived and farmed on this plot of land in the small rural town of Cushing, Maine. History and family lore tell us about the original family's journey from Massachusetts to leave behind the dark pall of the Salem witch trials. Living on the coast of Maine brings with it death and drownings and the lack of a male heir. The Hathorne's have been \"daughtered out\" until Christina's mother marries a Swedish sailor who happened to be iced in during a terrible storm. Change steps in and with it comes the reference to the now \"Olson House\".Christina suffers through relentless fevers that affect her muscles and mobility as a child. We pull back the curtain and experience the first episodes of Christina's stubbornness laced with the clutches of fear. Her father bundles her up and takes her on a long journey to a doctor who may be able to help her. Christina refuses to even subject herself to examination. The stage is now set and the spotlight focuses on her lifetime as a solo act no matter how many move in cadence alongside her.The artist, Andrew Wyeth, and his young wife, Betsy, become taken with the land that Christina and her brothers own. Christina invites more than just two unexpected individuals into this world of hers. He and Betsy weave in and out of the storyline as he creates his renowned painting. Wyeth, although not the main focus here, has a jagged backstory as well. Christina Baker Kline presents a splendid perspective on the life of Christina Olson. Kline opens the window within and shines light on the thought that there is much complication, depth, and intensity to a life even in the most simple of environments and surroundings. What appears on the surface of oils and canvas or classrooms or church pews or back seats on buses are voiceless souls seeking a word of validation. Kline reveals that complexity through Christina.Beautifully written, A Piece of the World speaks of simpler times. But in actuality, the progression of time reveals but one thing......the desire to matter and the desire to make a difference one day at a time."}, {"userName": "Marilyn C.", "userReviewDate": "Mar 12, 2017", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/8170584-marilyn-c", "userReview": "\"What she wants most - what she truly yearns for - is what any of us want: to be seen.\"Christina Olson lived her life mostly as a shut in, born with a degenerative disease that will take the use of her legs in childhood. The famous painter Andrew Wyeth befriends her, and will use her home and land to paint some of his most famous works, including the painting that now resides in the Museum of Modern Art, \"Christina's World\". A story told through Christina's eyes as she bravely deals with the hardships of her disease and the effects it takes on her life. She was a strong and determined woman, who through the progression of her disease would use just her arms to pull herself along the floor. I was obviously heartbroken for her, but as the story progressed I became frustrated with her inability to accept help, as she even declined a wheelchair and the way she treated her family and friends. This was a very intriguing and well researched story that historical fiction readers and art enthusiasts will enjoy. For those of us who like to know the background or \"story\" of a particular piece, Christina Baker Kline writes an in depth story about Wyeth and Christina's friendship and how the painting came into fruition.

They\u2019re passed from generation to generation, gaining substance and meaning along the way. You have to learn to sift through them, separating fact from conjecture, the likely from the implausible. Here is what I know: Sometimes the least believable stories are the true ones.\u201dTheir home at Hathorn Point in Cushing Maine was on land claimed by three men, two brothers, Samuel and William Hathorn, and William\u2019s son Alexander. They packed their belongings and fled Salem, Massachusetts for Maine in the middle of winter. At Hathorn Point, they built a tent made of animal skins to see them through the winter months. Log cabins followed, and eventually a house. A house and land that would be handed down from Christina\u2019s grandmother Mamey, to her mother, and then to their children. A place that would, indeed, become Christina\u2019s world.Betsy James is 9 years old the first time she appears at Christina\u2019s, and from that day on she remains a recurring, and welcome presence in Christina\u2019s life, and in her home. Betsy acknowledges Christina\u2019s physical barriers as one would acknowledge that her eyes were green, it is simply the way she was made. Christina feels at ease with young Betsy. Now 17, Betsy arrives one day at Christina\u2019s door, and mentions that her friend Andrew would like to paint a picture of her house. It doesn\u2019t surprise Christina that Betsey is there or has brought her friend Andrew, the son of N.C. Wyeth, the famous illustrator, artist, of such books at Treasure Island.We all know the picture, Christina\u2019s World by Andrew Wyeth, or enough people know it that according to Andrew\u2019s son Jamie Wyeth (also a well-known artist), the two most popular questions at the Museum of Modern Art are \u2018Where is the ladies room?\u2019 and \u2018Where is Christina\u2019s World?\u2019 It was the first painting I ever loved, and it remains my favourite. For me, it represents the yearning for some elusive home, to belong to something bigger than ourselves, and yet hesitant, timid, afraid to try for something that is right there and simultaneously seems so out of our reach. A wistfulness. A desire restrained by uncertainty; a tug on our heartstrings for home, the pull of our longing for more. \u201dHe did get one thing right: Sometimes a sanctuary, sometimes a prison, that house on the hill has always been my home. I\u2019ve spent my life yearning toward it, wanting to escape it, paralyzed by its hold on me. (There are many ways to be crippled, I\u2019ve learned over the years, many forms of paralysis.) My ancestors fled to Maine from Salem, but like anyone who tries to run away from the past, they brought it with them. Something inexorable seeds itself in the place of your origin. You can never escape the bonds of family history, no matter how far you travel. And the skeleton of a house can carry in its bones the marrow of all that came before.\u201dChristina was born with a degenerative disease, which hampered her mobility even as a young child, leaving her frequently stumbling and falling. Eventually it would progress from occasionally stumbling to the point where it was easier not to try to walk. Some believe she had a form of polio, more recent studies indicate it might be Charcot-Marie-Tooth disease, however she was never diagnosed during her lifetime. Needless to say, it made life on a farm difficult even in her younger years. Perhaps it made her dreams as a young woman more fragile. Her wish to be seen for herself, a woman with wants and desires, and not simply for her misshapen, unreliable body.Christina Baker Kline has woven together a story based on some facts, much research, and with A Piece of the World delivers a tender, poignant account of the story behind the painting that rings true. What Andrew Wyeth wrought on canvas, Christina Baker Kline has portrayed with her prose.

I don't know that I particularly liked Christina, but at the same time I felt a deep connection to her. We can all be tied to anchores and while some are able to pull themselves free, others let it pull them under.

Doctors had no idea what was wrong with her, but over the years she continued to get worse. Her life was centred around the home she\u2019d been born in \u2013 the family farm in Cushing, Maine. Christina lived with her mother, father and grandmother plus three brothers, and the duties of keeping the farm running increasingly fell on her shoulders. Made to leave school by her father at twelve years of age, Christina\u2019s yearning to become a teacher fell by the wayside at her father\u2019s demand that she was needed on the farm\u2026When Christina was forty-six, she lived with her brother Alvaro on the farm, and through her friend Betsy, she met a young Andrew Wyeth. Andy was an artist and his desire to paint and sketch Christina\u2019s home led to him spending days on end upstairs, engrossed in his work. His eventual painting of Christina, which was named Christina\u2019s World was much against her wishes \u2013 but Andy by that time was a good friend; little was she to know how well-known that painting would become. Over the years, Christina became Andy\u2019s inspiration \u2013 she felt that finally, someone understood her.A Piece of the World by Christina Baker Kline is a beautiful blend of fiction and non-fiction about Christina Olson\u2019s life, and the inspirational and historical painting by Andrew Wyeth called Christina\u2019s World. The Author\u2019s Note at the end of the book is fascinating where she explains how she came to research and write this novel. She says \u201cUltimately, A Piece of the World is a work of fiction.

Like Mona Lisa. She was the wife of Francesco del Giocondo, who commissioned the painting by Leonardo Da Vinci. But what do we really know about her?It was the same mystery behind the artist Andrew Wyeth's famous painting, titled Christina's World, which draw me to this book. The book has ..kind of.. this painting as a cover. But when I realized that this novel was written by Christina Baker Kline, the author of Orphan Train, one of my favorite books ever, I was hooked and booked. So this is the biographical, fictional tale of Chistina Olson, the real person in Wyeth's painting. It is also the history of both 1)the descendants of the notorious John Hathorne, one of the chief magistrates at the Salem Witch Trials between 1692 and 1693, 2) and the Olson House in Cushing, Maine. Despite her undiagnosed muscular deteriorational disease, which gradually paralyzed her lower body, Christina was once in her twenties, the Persephone of Walton Hall. However, Persephone did not survive. Not in Christina's body and not in Maine. Walton Hall left his goddess of the harvests and of spring behind without a second thought. Was it the curse?Bridget Bishop, an innkeeper accused of stealing eggs and transforming herself into a cat, put a curse on the Hathorne descendants. According to Mamey, Christina's beloved grandmother, it was not exactly a curse, more of a warning. Using the only power she possessed, Bridget Bishop instilled the fear of God into this cold-hearted, cruel man when she was sentenced to death. Some folks in Cushing suspected that the family, despite changing their name, and already almost two centuries later, have brought the witches with them. Their house was haunted. John Hothorne was still in their genes. The disability was genetic, it was later discovered. Christina Olson, born in 1893, was a tough, proud and stubborn women. Not only was she a descendant of the Witch Trials magistrate, but also from a poor Swedish peat-farming clan, the Olausons. Johan Olauson would change his name to John Olson in America. She would become the embodiment of some of the Americans' distinctive traits: rugged individualism, quiet strength, defiance in the face of obstacles, and unremitting perseverance.This is the story of the two Olson siblings, the last descendants living in the Olson house, and the painter who made their home his studio and them his subjects. \nHere we are, the two of us, not partners but siblings, destined to live out our lives together in the house we grew up in, surrounded by the phantoms of our ancestors, haunted by the phantom lives we might\u2019ve lived. A stack of letters hidden in a closet. A dory in the rafters of the shed. No one will ever know, when we\u2019re gone to dust, the life we\u2019ve shared here, our desires and our doubts, our intimacy and our solitude.\nTold in beautiful prose, and with an atmospheric infusion, this book is a MUST READ."}, {"userName": "Liz", "userReviewDate": "Mar 24, 2017", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/4125660-liz", "userReview": "3.5 starsUnlike most people, I was not a huge fan of Orphan Train. So, I wasn't sure how I'd like Kline\u2019s latest book. And the beginning was so slow and dry I thought, well, here we go again. But stick with it and you will be rewarded. The main character is Christina, the subject of Andrew Wyeth\u2019s Christina\u2019s World. It seemed to take forever before I felt invested in Christina. Not until her relationship with Walton did she come across as three dimensional. The meat of this book is all in the second half, as Christina\u2019s condition worsens, her parents fail and all her siblings but Al move away. I wish there had been more interaction between Wyeth and Christina as what there was constituted my favorite parts of the book. He is one of the few that appreciates her for who she is and how she lives her life, without pity.

Siblings Al and Christina Olson lived in their old ancestral home which had no modern conveniences--no electricity, and no indoor plumbing other than a hand pump in the kitchen. The book is named for Wyeth's famous painting \"Christina's World\" which depicts a field of yellowed grass and a woman in a pink dress crawling up the hill, heading toward a farmhouse in disrepair. Wyeth is showing Christina, who had a debilitating neuromuscular disease, as a woman with many qualities. Fragile, vulnerable, longing, strong, and persistent are adjectives that come to mind, and every viewer will see something different in the painting.The book is really Christina's story written as a fictional memoir of her life with her parents, her grandmother, and three brothers. She was an intelligent girl whose dream of becoming a teacher was taken from her when her parents needed her at home to do chores in the farmhouse. Her hope of love and marriage never worked out. Christina was a resilient worker at home, caring for her sickly parents and her siblings. She always had a stubborn streak, and refused to use a wheelchair as her mobility decreased. Andrew Wyeth treated Christina with a cheerful acceptance, and his presence was welcomed by both Christina and her brother. Al and Christina had a strong sibling connection--two people facing life together under difficult circumstances, both with dreams that were never realized.I loved Christina Baker Kline's writing in this story.

I knew, therefore, that a well constructed book about those persons would be interesting to me. For once, I got more than I anticipated. This book is marvelous.I must say, in fairness, that this is more about Christina herself and has less to do with Andrew Wyeth or his art than I had thought it would. No problem. Christina is a complex and multidimensional person with a life worth the exploration. Crippled at an early age, she is a study in self-reliance, strength, and perseverance. She is a study, as well, in the loneliness and isolation that comes with being different.It\u2019s a good question. How do I think of myself? The answer surprises us both. \u201cI think of myself as a girl,\u201d I say.One of the themes at the heart of this novel is the difference between how we see others and how they see themselves. Christina encounters so many people who see her as her infirmities, who discount her feeling and her intelligence because she has a broken body. Her brother sees her as his sister, who manages to take care of a home and family despite her limitations and as his playmate and sibling who has shared his life. She sees herself as a whole person, encased in a chrysalis from which there is no escape.It is this that explains the relationship that forms between the artist and his subject:Andy doesn\u2019t usually bring anything, or offer to help. He doesn\u2019t register alarm at the way we live. He doesn\u2019t see us as a project that needs fixing. He doesn\u2019t perch on a chair, or linger in a doorway, with the air of someone who wants to leave, who\u2019s already halfway out the door. He just settles in and observes.As we watch Christina\u2019s life unfold, we see how much of it is dictated by how others see her. We watch her dream and we watch those dreams destroyed, we see windows of opportunity open and close with slams that echo like the screen doors of the old house. We watch her world collapse upon her, and yet we see her struggle to make the most of the life she is given. At the end, these words of Kline\u2019s sum it up completely, The older I get, the more I believe that the greatest kindness is acceptance.This novel is everything that I look for in a great novel. There are characters that are real and lives that have meaning. There is tension for these characters to transcend and obstacles to power through, and the glory of the human spirit to applaud and descry. That this is based upon the life of an actual historic person makes it all the more poignant. I will now view Wyeth\u2019s Christina\u2019s World with a new layer of meaning.

Lastly, I love books that tell the little-known stories behind well-known people, places, and events.A Piece of the World is the story of Christina Olson, Wyeth\u2019s friend and muse. Christina is a very complicated woman; in turns she is stubborn, resilient, sensitive, strong, introspective, and perceptive. This story itself has obviously been meticulously researched.

Christina's movement is restricted by a crippling disease she was born with that only worsens as she gets older. Her world is restricted by a strict father who makes her quit school at 12, even though she exhibits brilliance, because she is needed to do chores. Later her heart is broken by a Harvard man and her place is pretty set. She becomes set in her ways as she and her brother run the farm and their parents are no more. Wyeth, at first a bothersome distraction, becomes a dear friend who with his wife understands Christina better than anyone. When he asks her to go outside in her best dress to sit for the painting that would make him famous, and her an enigma, she is hesitant but trusting. Later she tells him:You showed what no one else could see.... There she is, that girl, on a planet of grass. Her wants are simple. To tilt her face to the sun and feel it's warmth. To clutch the earth beneath her fingers. To escape from, and return to, the house she was born in. To see her life from a distance.... This is a girl who has lived through broken dreams and promises; still lives, will always live on that hillside.... Her world is both circumscribed and boundless....I felt the writer described Christina so perfectly there, with her introspection and frustrations, yet her endurance and love for what she sees around her. Christina enjoyed reading Willa Cather, and therein lies her true self. Such a lovely depiction, in more ways than one. A lovely, atmospheric listening experience."}, {"userName": "Stacey", "userReviewDate": "Mar 29, 2017", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/399175-stacey", "userReview": "I'm afraid I'll be in the minority with my rating, but don't let that deter you from picking this up.

When the description mentioned that this is fictional story weaved around a true figure in a well know painting I was even more excited because I was hoping it would be as interesting as Girl with a Pearl Earring.But sadly, this was just not my cup of tea.I get that Christina suffered. She was a perfectly healthy child deformed by a disease \u2013 which to my untrained ears that sounded like polio \u2013 and for the rest of her life she was trapped in a useless body.But the plot was just too thin on the ground, the characters unrelatable and the pace painfully slow.Christina went from a lonely and stubborn child to a lonely and bitter woman who even begrudged her own siblings a life of their own. There was no hint of hope in the story, just more loneliness and bleak disappointment to look forward to. I didn\u2019t feel engaged with the story and doubt that I will remember any of it in a month\u2019s time.It would have perhaps helped if I was a big fan of the famous painting Christina\u2019s World by Andrew Wythe but I had to Google it before I knew what it looked like.There was nothing wrong with the writing or the audio narration but not all books are for all readers and this one was not a good fit for me."}, {"userName": "Cindy Burnett", "userReviewDate": "Feb 20, 2017", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/2445617-cindy-burnett", "userReview": "A Piece of this World is inspired by Andrew Wyeth\u2019s painting, Christina\u2019s World. I am a fan of both Andrew and N.C. Wyeth\u2019s paintings and was therefore very eager to read this book. While I love the painting Christina\u2019s World and have seen it on display a number of times at MoMA, I never realized that Wyeth based the painting on someone he knew. The story goes back and forth through time slowly imagining Christina\u2019s sad story and how Andrew Wyeth came to know and paint her. Christina spent her entire life living in her family\u2019s dilapidated farm house in the small coastal town of Cushing, Maine. As a young child, she developed a debilitating disease that was never diagnosed but slowly robbed her of the ability to walk and use her limbs effectively. While she was quite intelligent, her father made her leave school after eighth grade and tend to household items. She never fully got over having to abandon her education. Between the school issue, her illness, and an unhappy romance, Christina developed into a complicated and sometimes bitter woman making choices that demonstrated her acrimony. I found it hard to like her but enjoyed learning her story. Wyeth met Christina one summer when his family was visiting Maine. They went on to develop a relationship that lasted many years. Andrew Wyeth brought out a more sympathetic side of Christina, which he immortalized in his painting. The portions of the story where Wyeth appears and interacts with both Christina and her brother Al were my favorites.Christina Baker Kline writes a character driven novel that brings Christina\u2019s World vividly to life.

Does that mean that all the characters are apple pie mode norms? No. But it does mean that they are often peaceful, gentle, apt to comply and assist, and are also hard working norms for their lives' era. Nearly all of these humans in this piece of the world are. And doubly so are the 3 main protagonists: Christina Olsen, her brother Al and Andy Wyeth. What a breath of fresh air. And the \"point\" placement in Cushing, Maine amid the periods of the late 19th and first half of the 20th century were superbly detailed.Work, work, work. So much of common life was all about it. Before electricity and central heating- it was a group activity of hour after hour. You slept when the sun went down or close on after. Never done. Like milking the cows on a dairy farm is (even today). That's what most people of this particular era never really \"get\", IMHO. And why so many books about the privileged in those eras and before those eras are almost entirely \"revised\" in today's \"eyes\". Because even they, in toilet, bath, cleanliness, diet and much more had far more toil and procedure to the minute by minute. And why, even with endless and progressive numbers of servants, it was not any surety to maintain a consistent period of health and energy for \"else\" than work.Christina was different to the others of her generation in her ailment. But common and usual in the dictates that ruled her life's decisions. Many of them were made from circumstance and necessity. And rejection and leaving were the largest opposite alternatives.This book denotes a life of service. Most will interpret it as sad. I interpret it as strength. She had immense strength in resisting destructive medicine and recognizing it for what it was. That makes her an outlier from the get-go.But this author also gives you the wonderful gift of seeing a life of service and work in eyes that reflect the lessons of core quality that it gave. Not just to Christina. Where some would see waste. I see superlative growth, honor, integrity and especially ability to embed in the essence of surround and nature. You get that in the ultimate product of that well known Wyeth painting too. She is planted. Not sad. Triumphant!It lost a star for me only in the switching time periods. The earliest years in this book made me think of my German grandmother and I actually dreamt about her. She was the oldest of 10 and only the first and last were girls. Even on the very day of her Confirmation/Graduation she had to take her one good dress off after the procession down the mountain and wash clothes in tubs. She told me stories constantly and NEVER in any mood of ire or resentment either. She lived until 99 and was a gorgeous 18 when WWI started. She lost all her brothers but 1 in both wars. One of her brothers was the mayor and was taken to the town square and shot when the Nazi's took over. Her youngest brother was a Nazi Youth who died in a Russian prison after they cut off his leg- he was less than 20. They were all tall blondes and Hollywood stunning looking people- I have their photo as a group done in 1914. She was tiny and had dark hair and was BEAUTIFUL. So she was always their \"schwarzy\". She had a personality almost exactly like Christine- she had terrible asthma until she moved to the USA in her late 30's. She also was ALWAYS the \"sickly\" one. It took 8 years (separated from husband during that entire time) to get into America. Even after getting permission papers she was set \"off the boat\" twice for being underweight and \"lung\" afflicted. And she held nearly an exact fortitude to Christine's in this book. Never \"poor me\" but always moving slowly, despite the \"falls\". And as kind too. Always. It never fails to amaze me how some authors can bring back people in \"real\" life to their readers. This one sure did. This book holds no foul language and is slow and filled with quite and often introverted people. If you want action packed or traveling extrovert shenanigans, this will not be the book for you. You may find it boring. The point that many people do NOT roam much from their origins or own natural personality is also a point to take in this book. Why and how it was and less often is now, but does occur. Time passes and some people will continue to layer their own hurts and contentment capacity.

Its through his eyes that Christina can finally be truly seen.Based on Andrew Wyeth\u00b4s \"Christina\u00b4s World\", this novel chronicles the life of Christina Olson (the woman of the painting). Considered one of the best known American paintings of the mid twenty century and one of Andrew Wyeth\u00b4s most prominent works, this painting served as the background. Wyeth and Chrsitina became close friends. Him being to see Christina in a different light. Due in large part to her ailment, Christina was rough around the edges, stubborn and somewhat difficult. But what stands out about her is her determination and strength. Even as her mobility declined, she continued her work on the farm. The strokes on Wyeth\u00b4s canvas matches the lyrical prose of Kline. Kline seamlessly combines fact and fiction to produce an evocative work. Rich in details and heart, this novel was beautifully written.

The writing was emotive and often tinged with melancholy, lushly descriptive, thoughtfully observant, cunningly crafted, and intricately detailed. A fascinating mix of fact and fiction, I have since spent far too much time Googling Christina Olson and Andrew Wyeth\u2019s iconic artwork. I was immediately immersed in this beautifully and insightfully written book from the first person POV of Christina, a girl/woman with few options and limited mobility. Christina lived her entire life in the same house with her slightly odd family in small-town rural Maine and had continued to live under extremely harsh conditions without indoor plumbing, running water, or electricity, long after others in her area were enjoying these luxuries. Christina was possibly the most obstinate woman of her time. Unsteady on her weak limbs following an life-threatening and undiagnosed illness at the age of three, she despised pity, denied most offers of assistance despite frequent mishaps and injuries from falls, refused to seek medical assistance when offered, and in her later years when her legs were no longer of use to her she steadfastly refused to use a wheelchair and drug herself by her elbows, up and down stairs and even across fields to visit her neighbor.

To take it in, and relive the book, relive Christina's life in the way that Christina Baker Kline so masterfully portrayed it and portrayed Christina.

She is stubborn, gritty and at times harsh, not unlike the rugged Maine coastline the story is set in. I won't give more away more of the plot, but I think you'll find yourself growing to empathize with Christina. The author spent years researching and crafting the book to tell the story behind Andrew Wyeth's painting titled Christina's World. The connection to the Salem witch trials and the Nathaniel Hawthorn family was fascinating. A really excellent story. I don't give 5 stars often.
