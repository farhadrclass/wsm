This author has surprised me again with this tale of a man who enters a forest to take photographs, he goes to where he already had placed a 'trap' camera, to take photos with no one there. When he looks at the photos from the camera he sees a woman being murdered, captured in the pictures, then burned and buried. Imagine his horror at this, the night is closing in, he must go and report what he has found. The author writes this book as you would take a photo, short,descriptive words that let you know what is happening. This way of writing helps you feel exactly what the man, Remington, is feeling. If you let yourself read the story in this way you really get a profound effect. Something different that has made me sit up and recommend that you thriller readers give this book a chance!"}, {"userName": "Mark Rubinstein", "userReviewDate": "Apr 30, 2014", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/10469395-mark-rubinstein", "userReview": "Double Exposure is a chilling novel about a man whose life is at a crossroads. He enters a Florida swamp intending to photograph wildlife and encounters a group of men who have committed a murder his cameras (planted on trees)have captured. The chase begins. It's a tale of survival, reckoning, and of coming to terms with the limitations and regrets one may have about one's life. Told in dramatic, lyrical detail, the novel takes the reader through a nail-biting trek for survival and realization.

He returns to his hometown to run his father's store and care for his mother who is dying of MS. While he is home, he decides to pick up the hobby, the passion, he gave up years ago, wildlife photography. He has set trap cameras in the woods of the Apalachicola River Basin in hopes of maybe catching the elusive Florida panther. As he is out taking pictures and checking his traps one evening, he discovers that he has caught not the panther on his camera, but a murder. And now the murderers are hunting Remington through the pitch black of the Florida woods.If readers want to read DOUBLE EXPOSURE surfacely and minimally, they are in for a heart-pounding thriller. Lister's written a tight plot that doesn't allow one to slow down for even a second, just like his protagonist.Lister created a powerful effect by being a minimalist in this novel. His protagonist is a photographer out taking pictures in the woods. Lister's prose mimics that process so you can hear the camera shutter click as you read:Evening. Glow.Dark figures.Shot.Explosion.Bloom of blood.Body dropping to the cold ground.Death. Digging.Fire.And Lister's setting development carries you smack into the middle of Remington's Eden that is horrifically transformed into his Hell all in the course of one night. Remington reminds himself to \"Use your senses. All of them.\" And Lister helps the readers to use their senses, all of them. Whether they are seeing the beauty of the landscape or the nightmare of a murder. Whether they are hearing life, or feeling fear. Readers will definitely be in the woods with Remington James on the most terrifying night of his life. But they'll have to listen carefully to hear nature's sounds over the thumping of their own hearts.If you want to delve deeper, you will find a complex interweaving of theme, plot, character and setting that results in a magical reading experience. Remington is almost a unique character in crime fiction in that he comes from a functional family. His parents loved him and he loved his parents; while Remington doesn't seem conscious of it, the reader quickly learns that both parents taught him skills that made him a great man.And of course, nature is a prominent theme as well as a symbol in DOUBLE EXPOSURE. The dark of night is essential to build up the suspense, but it plays a role also in the idea that man is destroying nature. So Remington's manic race is not just a race for his life, but a race for nature. Can they both make it out alive?Brilliant.Beautiful.Must-read!"}, {"userName": "Jon", "userReviewDate": "Jan 08, 2010", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/929592-jon", "userReview": "I'm not sure now where I heard about this book--I thought it was from this site, but not that I can now discover. It certainly is a page-turner with a heartfelt and profound message growing out of the story and summarized memorably at the end. It begs to be read at one sitting, so don't pick it up unless you've got a couple or three hours. The entire plot is set in the woods and sloughs of northern Florida, where the protagonist has gone to check on an automatic camera he has set up to photograph wildlife. He finds that he has photographed a murder, and almost before he can collect his thoughts, he is spotted and then stalked through the woods by the killer and his team of bad guys. Anything else we learn is through flashbacks and memories as the hunted photographer tries to outwit his hunters. The style is very different from any thriller I have ever read--a brave experiment on the part of a young author. Unfortunately it didn't really work for me--it was a little too self-consciously arty. It removed me from the immediacy of the experience while trying to do just the opposite. Still, a very memorable read with a noble and honest conclusion."}, {"userName": "Heather", "userReviewDate": "Aug 17, 2012", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/2567707-heather", "userReview": "2 1/2 stars.

I didn't quite know what to expect in this off road experience. This is an equally compelling read told in a completely different style. In a mere economy of 200+ pages Lister creates an intense, lyrical tale of flight for survival .... with the protagonist, Remington James, realizing the essence and importance of life. Told in a staccato of well placed words that builds the tension to a fever pitch. Remington James, returns to his beloved roots of wildlife photography .... abandoning his unhappy , but successful life as advertising executive. He enters the family owned woods in North Florida area to \"check out\" his camera traps. Instead of capturing the images of the elusive Florida panther ... he has a crisly murder scene on film. Before he can retreat and report the murder ... he is confronted by the murderer. The crescendo of the chase to avoid his own elimination by the band of psychotic killers is worth the price of admission.

Some young girlWas shot in the head and buried in a grave and burned by a conservation guy. That didn't make sense. And why would Gage call a posse in to kill him or the poacher he saw earlier on the land. All he wanted was to take wildlife pictures for his mother and Heather. He never imagined his last 24 hours on earth would be running for his life and having to kill men after him.

Double Exposure is totally different from Michael Lister's John Jordan. Written in a totally different way that captivates you from the first words. We tour the deep woods and swamps of the Florida panhandle and see the native animals. Yes, we see these things thru the eyes of Remington James.The elegant words of the author send the detailed pictures to you. Lister touches on the greed that makes humans destroy what is beautiful.

Death, an affirmation of life. Love, the glue that binds everything together, that gives purpose and meaning to life. This was an astonishing book. Fast paced, thrilling, as well written as his John Jordan series (which I love), yet different. Staccato comes to mind in terms of style. Prose that's almost poetic, too.

Fr\u00fcher streifte er an jedem Samstagmorgen mit seinem Dad durch die W\u00e4lder \u2013 Cole wollte Wild schie\u00dfen, Remington Bilder. Momente festhalten und eben diese besonderen Augenblicke nicht mehr gehen lassen. Als Remington in den Wald seiner Jugend zur\u00fcckkehrt, baut er Kameras an verschiedenen Stellen auf, die automatisch Bilder aufnehmen, wenn das Infrarot reagiert. Und zugleich ist das sein Verderben: Er fotografiert unbewusst einen Mord und wird dabei ertappt. Ein Wettlauf durch den dunklen Wald beginnt\u2026Schreib-/Erz\u00e4hlstil:Lister setzt viel auf Alliterationen, aber auch auf Aufz\u00e4hlungen von Gef\u00fchlen, die sein Hauptprotagonist in verschiedenen Stadien des Buches durchlebt. Dabei charakterisiert er Remington bis zur letzten Minuten aus und zeigt, wie man \u00fcber sich hinauswachsen kann. Dabei erf\u00e4hrt der Leser aber nur klischeehafte Einblicke in das Leben des Amerikaners, der innerhalb k\u00fcrzester Zeit viel erreicht hat: Das Geld hat die Liebe zu seiner Frau Heather und zur Fotografie \u00fcberlagert. Er steht kurz vor einer Scheidung, die er im Laufe der Nacht im Wald bis in die Spitzen der Leidenschaft f\u00fcr seine Frau Heather \u00fcberdenkt. Damit macht Lister nichts Neues, aber er wirkt mit dem Thrill zusammen aussichtslos und \u00e4ngstlich.Meine Meinung:Es ist an manchen Stellen etwas kompliziert, sich nur auf die Alliterationen und die vage Aufz\u00e4hlung von Momentaufnahmen zu verlassen und nicht vollst\u00e4ndige S\u00e4tze zur Ansicht zu haben. So ist der Leser auf sich allein gestellt, die Nachtluft im Wald zu riechen und zu schmecken und die Schlangen, B\u00e4ren und anderen Tiere zu sehen. Das gelingt Lister dann wiederum sehr gut.Die Jagd durch den Wald und die Angst, die Remington immer wieder bef\u00e4llt, ist atemberaubend. Das Ansinnen, sich der Erde und den Menschen zu widmen wirkt etwas abgedroschen und ziemlich kitschig, weist aber eine tiefe Verbundenheit mit dem Land und der Natur auf, die ich genauso f\u00fchle. St\u00e4ndig baut man alles zu: Hier noch eine Stra\u00dfe, da noch ein Neubaugebiet \u2013 abtragen, plattwalzen, verkaufen, handeln, Fundamente setzen, K\u00e4ufer besichtigen, kaufen, W\u00e4nde hochziehen. Tiere fl\u00fcchten, Mutter Natur wird vertrieben wie ein Hausierer. Unerw\u00fcnscht, weggetreten, verjagt, isoliert auf ein paar Restbest\u00e4nde.Das Ende ist ziemlich unspektakul\u00e4r und etwas zu dramatisch, deswegen ziehe ich einen Punkt ab. Hier wird an Deutlichkeit gespart \u2013 und diesmal doch etwas zu viel. Da h\u00e4tte mir Lister etwas mehr Worte geben d\u00fcrfen, die das Ende besser ausgepolstert h\u00e4tten.Fazit:Ein Selbstausl\u00f6ser, der einen Mord zeigt und einen Wettlauf gegen die Zeit ausl\u00f6st. Alles kommt zusammen: Familie, Natur, Menschen und das nackte \u00dcberleben. Dabei wechselt Lister nie den Ort, denn der Wald bietet geradezu eine erstaunlich gut gew\u00e4hlte Kulisse.

First published by Tyrus Books, there is a new edition out with an introduction by Michael Connelly.Remington is deep in the Florida woods, hunting for a trophy. But he doesn't carry a gun. It's a camera. He wants a spectacular photo. A bear, or maybe even the elusive eastern cougar. Something that will prove to his mom and wife that he was destined to be a photographer. And while checking his camera trap left in a tree stand the night before, he indeed finds something amazing captured on the memory card. But it's not a bear, or a bobcat, or even a panther. It's a murder.Be careful what you wish for.As the impact of what he's viewing sinks in, Remington realizes he must get back to his ATV and civilization. But he's not alone anymore. Movement triggers the camera, still attached to the tree, and in the growing twilight the strobe flash erupts.\"Did you just take a picture of me?\", a voice asks from the woods. With those words begins a frantic night of chase and terror. As the bullets fly above his head, Remington flees deeper into the woods, the murderer's smooth southern voice still echoing in his ear: \"This is the end of the line, partner\".Other men join the chase, friends of the killer, who we learn is named Gauge. As his life and the relationship with his mom, his recently deceased dad and his failing marriage literally flash before his eyes, Remington must struggle to escape as the hunters circle around him. With no stars to guide him, encroaching fog and plummeting temperature, he realizes it's going to be a long night.Using his radio, Gauge begins to talk to Remington, urging him to surrender, almost apologizing for what he has to do. After all, I'm just trying to survive...like you, he tells Remington. Under different circumstances, the two men could have been friends, sitting in a corner diner having breakfast before a hunt. Despite his better judgement, Remington begins to respond to Gauge's friendly banter.- They're taking bets on you now. You want in?- What odds can I get?- Not bad actually. Started at twenty to one, but now they're down to twelve to one.- Yeah, I'll take some of that. Put me in for a hundred.- You got it.The dialogue between the men, hunter and prey, throws the reader off guard and adds to the tension. We like Remington. We're rooting for him. But at some point we find ourselves liking Gauge as well. We don't want to. But we do, in some twisted, creepy way. After all, he's a likeable guy...for a killer.This story follows a similar plot line as The Most Dangerous Game, the much anthologized story by Richard Connell, but is far better. Probably the finest example of Man Vs. Man I have read in years.You should read it.Alone. At Night.But keep your cell phone handy...in case you need to call a friend. Or 911."}, {"userName": "Lynn  Davidson", "userReviewDate": "Jun 19, 2014", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/8457950-lynn-davidson", "userReview": "I had not read any of Michael Lister\u2018s books until Double Exposure, so I didn\u2019t know what to expect. After reading the blurb on the cover: \u201c\u2026 absolutely riveting! \u2026 squeezed every ounce of terror and thrills out of a dark night in the woods\u201d I thought this book is one I would not want to read late at night. I can be easily spooked, especially if I am really drawn into the story. Not to worry.There was one section near the end where I did feel the tension, but the rest of the story was mild as a thriller. I\u2019m sure it could easily affect other readers quite differently. Although intended to add suspense, what broke the tension for this reader was how, in many places, the author wrote in clipped one word thoughts. It left much for one to imagine, which can be a good thing, but it also seemed to yank the reader through the story, the choppiness tending to keep one from fully engaging in the drama.Remington James moves back to Florida after his father\u2019s death and takes on the care of his ailing mother. He also picks up his camera again, something he had drifted away from in favour of the big income. While trekking through his father\u2019s woodland (left to him) to check out his camera traps (hidden cameras set up to capture wildlife images when he is not there to do it) he discovers something unthinkable. Soon after, he finds himself in a dire situation. The rest of the story is the main character\u2019s struggle to survive and all the dangers set against him.Despite what I said in the second paragraph, Double Exposure does have its high points. Michael Lister has written a story that is gripping and action-filled. His main character becomes an accidental victim and is mercilessly pursued through hazardous circumstances. Never mind some questionable moments, this is a story that pulls the reader along just to find out what is going to happen next.
