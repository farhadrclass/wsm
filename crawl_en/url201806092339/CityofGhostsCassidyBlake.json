The story felt like a fun middle grade read with just the right amount of creepy, but it might not appeal to fans who mostly read her adult books. I genuinely love middle grade, though, and thought this was a really solid, well-rounded story with a creative premise!Cassidy's a Ravenclaw who died while drowning but was brought back by Jacob, a ghost who's now her best friend. She's a sort of \"in-betweener\" now who can free spirits trapped in the Veil. The book description's really good and I don't want to spoil any other points, so I'll just leave it there.Otherwise, it was a pretty quick read that I finished in one sitting (mostly because it was just so engaging).

Here is what I will say:1. If I had read this book at 10 or 11, I wouldn't have wanted to be any other fictional character. 2. This book is a perfect middle grade book that leaves you wanting more. It is action packed and I would have been happier with 200 more pages. 3. This book is going to be a perfect book to get some kids into the horror/thriller genre of life. It is just creepy enough to make me want to not read it right before bed, but not too scary that a kid won't enjoy it. 4. I honestly enjoyed this more than the Savage Song series. Not one bad thing to say about that duology- this just truly struck me in a place of childhood remembrance and made it fresh. 5. I will be buying this in hardback the day it comes out #sorrynotsorry."}, {"userName": "Amy", "userReviewDate": "May 22, 2018", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/13507409-amy", "userReview": "It\u2019s safe to say I am a huge fan of Victoria Schwab. She can write adult, YA, and middle grade fiction and I\u2019d be the first in line to buy them all.I\u2019m also a huge paranormal fan. I grew up in a \u201chaunted\u201d college town. I\u2019ve loved ghost stories as a kid and I still have a fascination with old legends and local haunts. City of Ghosts is being marketed as Stranger Things meets Ghost Hunters. I agree with the Ghost Hunters part. But, did you ever watch Are You Afraid of the Dark? on Nickelodeon? Because I legit feel like City of Ghosts could be an episode from that show.Submitted for the approval of the Midnight Society, I call this story\u2026Ahem. I digress.I\u2019ll skip writing a summary since the synopsis above already does a wonderful job explaining the key points (which I think is a bit of a shame because it really could benefit from a more vague description.) However, since this is middle grade, the synopsis is probably overly descriptive for parents to judge whether this book is right for their child/age group. So please keep in mind that this is a middle grade book. If you only prefer Schwab\u2019s adult books then this might not be the perfect match for you.There were so many things I loved about City of Ghosts: The unshakable friendship between Cassidy and Jacob, the adventures they ensue in Edinburgh, the quirky ghost-hunting parents, and all the creepy spirits. The story is very fast paced and flows beautifully. I especially loved how the Veil was used as a means for Cassidy to use her \u201cgift\u201d and discover her \u201cpurpose\u201d. My only qualm is I wish we got a little more info on Jacob, but I think there\u2019s a possibility this is setting up for a sequel.\n\n\u201cEmbrace your strange, dear daughter. Where\u2019s the fun in being normal?\u201d\n\nOverall this was such a treat from Schwab. I really hope we get more Cass and Jacob. This would be perfect for Halloween and for anyone who wants a quick, haunting read. If you want some spooky lore set in Scotland, amazing friendships, and that dash of nostalgia \u00e0 la Are You Afraid of the Dark?, then I highly recommend City of Ghosts!Thank you so much to my friend Mary for letting me borrow her ARC copy of City of Ghosts!All quotes were taken from an ARC and is subject to change upon publication."}, {"userName": "Tanja Voosen", "userReviewDate": "Jan 22, 2018", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/5464546-tanja-voosen", "userReview": "Das ist zwar nicht die originellste Idee, aber ich liebe Geister-Geschichten und das Cover ist sau cool!!!

But that\u2019s only part of what makes Cassidy a fascinating main character for Schwab\u2019s new book; Cass once drowned, and because she came back from near-death, she came back with her very own ghostly sidekick and now, best friend, Jacob. Cassidy can see him and other ghosts, and go beyond \u2018The Veil\u2019, and she only comes to truly understand what this all means when she gets to Edinburgh. The book is endearing, funny, and clever throughout, and contains enough appropriately-scary scenes and ideas for the age group it\u2019s written for. I would have been clamoring for this book when I was younger. The scary scenes beyond \u2018The Veil\u2019 and with the Red Raven are expertly written, and are creepy enough to only leave the reader with a chill but not scare beyond their wits. There are also some other minor characters written, like the young girl Cassidy meets in Edinburgh, Lara, who teaches her a lot about \u2018what\u2019 she is actually is, an \u2018In-Betweener\u2019 and even the city of Edinburgh feels like a character of its own.Victoria Schwab has crafted a near-perfect book, middle-grade or otherwise, which blends reality with fantasy, and gives the reader characters who are identifiable and likable. I felt like Cassidy was written for a younger version of myself (or is that still me?); I was obsessed so much with ghosts at that age of around 11-12, that it influenced my choice of boarding school, and Cassidy is also walking around with an old camera around her neck, and with her cat Grim by her side (a camera AND a cat?!) . And the glorious part where she tries British fish and chips for the first time; Schwab was after my soul. Our ghostly friend Jacob has emotion sweeping about him and makes the idea of having a spirit for a sidekick (especially if they\u2019ll save your life on a whim), incredibly appealing. The excitement around this book is warranted, and I hope the adventures of Cassidy (and Jacob) continue. This may well be a book written for 12-year old girls, but the actual readers will surely span ages and other reader groups. Just such a special, unique, and thrilling read."}, {"userName": "Sabrina The Trash Queen", "userReviewDate": "Jan 27, 2018", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/63480503-sabrina-the-trash-queen", "userReview": "creepy cover!"}, {"userName": "Kaycee Bowick (Off_The_Press)", "userReviewDate": "Jan 12, 2018", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/14978558-kaycee-bowick-off-the-press", "userReview": "There really aren't many things I love more than Ghost Hunters and Stranger Things and novels?

I had high hopes, as her Shades of Magic series receives plenty of critical acclaim. Her middle grade debut, however, was just... okay. City of Ghosts follows Cassidy, a Harry Potter loving tween, whose parents write books about ghosts for a living. It's a not-so-normal life for a not-so-normal girl who's had a near-death experience that left her with the ability to see ghosts. When her parents land a TV show traveling to the most haunted cities across the globe, Cassidy and her best friend, a ghost named Jacob, depart on a paranormal adventure in Edinburgh, Scotland. With their cat, Grim, of course.There is much to love in that synopsis: Edinburgh, ghost hunting, Harry Potter, cats. The paranormal aspects are fantastic and well-explained. The emphasis on friendships is refreshing. But the overall impression I've received is one of a colorful exterior with a distinctly unmemorable interior. It was the type of story that I unfortunately will not remember the plot of - or even the main character's name - by next month. Jacob and the Raven in Red - the key villain in this story - were two of the most fascinating pieces of this story, full of mystery. Yet both of them were tragically underdeveloped. I was hoping for more for Jacob's character - of his backstory, his personality, anything to hint at some form of growth. The Raven in Red also lacked depth apart from her tragic backstory. There were plenty of pieces set in place, yet Schwab seemed to just skim the surface with each of them. Overall, not bad but not memorable either. Perhaps we have much to look forward to in Book 2."}], "description": "Cassidy Blake's parents are The Inspectres, a (somewhat inept) ghost-hunting team. But Cass herself can REALLY see ghosts.

In Scotland, Cass is surrounded by ghosts, not all of them friendly. Then she meets Lara, a girl who can also see the dead. But Lara tells Cassidy that as an In-betweener, their job is to send ghosts permanently beyond the Veil.
