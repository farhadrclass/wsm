It had a simple and beautiful story, I loved the ending and I liked they way it felt like it had a lesson or two or 'something to say' without ever feeling like a sitcom episode where someone basically looks down the camera and says, \"So kids, what'd we learn today?\" It was well handled and I'll be keeping an eye out for some of the other books by this author."}, {"userName": "Amy Lignor", "userReviewDate": "Jan 05, 2012", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/6259268-amy-lignor", "userReview": "There is no teenager (or adult, most likely) living on the planet right now who would not say that they would love to simply jump in a car and take off. They would be thrilled to see the country, with their best friend by their side, and fly far away from home in order to meet new people and experience brand new adventures. That is exactly what Hattie did - with one small difference; she did all this so that a very special friend could be free.Speed is a horse who is just plain tired. He\u2019s been a work-horse all his life and done what everyone had always told him to do. At sixteen hands this \u2018old man\u2019 is rather large, and his best friend is a young girl who wants nothing more than to stop him from being put down the next day. Speed is headed for the final frontier in the morning, and although his owners are not trying to be mean, Hattie knows that it\u2019s just not fair. Speed is not ill, or in pain, and he deserves to have at least one moment where he can run across a pasture and be free.Hattie Wyatt and her friend Delores head for the road. Delores is a nice girl that Hattie met when they took their GED classes together. Although Hattie is only \u2018escaping\u2019 for a while, Delores comes from a much harsher climate - living with a mother who\u2019s far more interested in her newest boyfriend then she is in her daughter. Delores has been asked to leave by Mom, and she has no idea where her journey will end. Hattie has stuck by Delores for a few years now, dealing with her sudden mood changes and helping her through the suicidal thoughts and deeds that are a part of Delores\u2019s life. The one thing that Delores and Speed have in common is the fact that they both want to roam - far away from the people who have treated them as servants. Stealing a trailer, Delores and Hattie sneak into the stable and load up Speed. Setting off across the country, they meet everything from kind waitresses at 4:00 am to jerks on ATV\u2019s who want to scare them; they see everything from Wisconsin drivers wearing hats that look like cheese (Go, Packers!) to a wonderful lady who truly wishes Speed were her very own.Between the beautiful, bold story of true and utter friendship to the stunning locales and the history that is given throughout regarding various horse breeds, the author has done a lovely job of putting together a story that is truly beautiful. For anyone who wishes to roam, or to somehow find that pasture where they can run and be free, this is the book you don\u2019t want to miss.Until Next Time, Everybody,Amy"}, {"userName": "Liz", "userReviewDate": "Jan 15, 2012", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/7433454-liz", "userReview": "One of those quiet books that just blows you away! A deceptively simple plot: two girls steal a horse the day before it's to be put down, to drive West and find a place where the horse can just \"be a horse\" and live out its last days.Beautiful language and believable characters. Even better, the two girls are from a class that usually don't appear in books unless they're abused, alcoholic meth dealers. Yes, the rural poor! And while they may have to work with their hands for a living, and met in a GED class, their lives are never held up to be pitied, or something that one must escape from, or the \"other.\"Also, the girls aren't punished for their sex! They are allowed the freedom of a road trip without any violent sexual attacks. They sleep under the stars. They have a few laughs. They stare down obnoxious local boys. They meet a few cute guys. No hidden \"it's dangerous to do this, girls\" message here.Final, bonus points in that there is no artificial love triangle, no boy that makes all thoughts of friendship go out the window in the competition to have a boyfriend."}, {"userName": "Lesr Kew", "userReviewDate": "Aug 20, 2016", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/20504934-lesr-kew", "userReview": "a really nice story of friendship and horses for a younger audience. it would have been my favorite book had i read it when i was younger!"}, {"userName": "Mary", "userReviewDate": "Jan 18, 2012", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/1460812-mary", "userReview": "What a lovely book! Two teenage girls and an elderly horse on a road trip from the mountains of New Hampshire to the prairies of the west. The horse, Speed, is about to be put down, and 16-year-old Hattie steals him from her employers in order to save his life. Not very good judgement, perhaps, but believable - these are teenagers. As with \"Small as an Elephant\", this book was brief, clear, and felt very real. The strongest aspect of it was Hattie's bond with Speed, her pity for his life of drudgery, and what that said about this young girl's soul. Mr. Monniger wrote all his characters - both human and horse - with truthfulness and respect, and his prose was often lovely.

It made me wish I had a horse or at least more contact with horses. What beautiful animals! I really like the way the author wrote and describes people and situations.So, let's see. The two main characters are girls, best friends. I believe one is eighteen and the other sixteen. They grew up in New Hampshire, both to single mothers. They seem to be from lower income families, and they both have gotten their GED. And they both love horses. One struggles from (and it's never actually labeled, but this is what is sounds like to me) depression, and she has engaged in some self destructive behaviors in the past. Her mother is not very loving. The other has a loving mother.The descriptions of the Fergusons throughout the book was interesting. Spoiled, ignorant rich people? Caring? Selfish? Understanding? It depends on who you ask; you never actually meet them. And that was interesting to me. Your opinion of someone is just that\u2014an opinion. It was an interesting discussion of the elite.The SPAM museum was pretty funny.Everything was interesting really. The different people they meet on their journey. Their parents' reactions. The places they stop. They journey they're on.It is very cool to know there are places like that for horses today.This is a clean read. I don't remember any swearing. Although if your teenager does read it, you should know the main characters in this novel save up money and leave home for a month or so, and only tell their mothers after they have left.\"She wore about a dozen friendship bracelets that people had given her, and whenever she reached up to touch Speed, her wrists flashed braided strings. She always liked little things like that, and she reminded me of a Christmas tree sometimes, only a tree in a household that didn't have much, a tree that had to be decorated with popcorn strings and clothespin animals rather than fancy crystal balls and soft white lights. There was always a little something 'make-do' about Delores, something thrift-store and sub-retail, and that wouldn't have been bad except you could tell it sometimes got to her and made her self-conscious and lonely in her head.\"\"'You know it's weird,' Delores said, twisting open the orange soda. 'All the times you think about your dad getting in touch . . . you have these fantasies. You figure he'll ride up one day and say what a mistake he made to ignore you all these years, then take you out and buy you beautiful clothes and a new car or something, and he'll tell you he's really rich and he wants you to come live with him, and he has no other kids, you know, all that stuff. And he'll have some great explanation about why he wasn't in touch, and it will make sense, and you will know, viola, that was the reason all along. Everything clicks into place.''But it's not like that,' I said. 'It's never like that. Whenever I see my dad, it's just this guy who's supposed to be more to me than he is. It's never what you think it will be.'\"\"Punch reached over and took my hand.Just like that.I didn't look at him, but I didn't move my hand from his. I felt such a commotion in my stomach and guts that I thought for a second I might have to put my head down between my knees and breathe steadily.Delores said, 'Blah, blah, blah, blah,' and I had no idea what she said, but when she turned around to catch my eye, she flashed down to our hands sitting between us, and she turned right back around as though she had seen a snake. But I liked the way my hand felt in his, and I liked his hand It felt as tough as rope, and dry and quiet. He didn't flex his fingers, or do anything stupid, or try to send me secret messages. He simply held my hand, and it felt like the world had become less empty by his doing it. You wondered why people didn't always hold hands, even if they had just met.\"\"Expectation is the enemy of serenity.\"\"'I think,' I said my forehead close to Speed's, 'Speed gets to me because he never fought back. Whatever anyone wanted from him, he gave. And he didn't complain and he did it year after year. I don't know. Somewhere along the line someone has to acknowledge that. He was a gentle, kind creature and he deserves a rest. I wanted him to be a horse, but maybe in some way he was more of a horse than a thousand stallions out on a prairie. Think of all the children he carried on his back, the joy he gave them, and he never asked for anything himself. He never would have thought to ask for anything, so I have to ask for him. Day in, day out, he showed patience to everyone. I love him for that. He taught me that.'\"\"I know it sounds crazy, but I saw them in my heart before I saw them on the sloping grade above us. Their hooves made a deep pounding sound, and a second later they appeared. Dolores reached over and grabbed my arm and we sat frozen and watched them come. A herd of horses, all stirring up grass and dust and slobber. They ran right at us, flinging themselves along the ground, a few prideful males out on the flanks, ears flexing, tails up, hooves gouging the dirt. No halters, I realized. No anything. They ran naked and pure, a blend of muscle and hair and sound, and I felt my heart lift in my chest and nearly burst. Delores pulled over and jammed the truck into park and jumped out. I did, too. I couldn't help running back to the trailer and yelling for Speed to come look, and I bawled like an idiot, my chest heaving and unable to catch air. 'That's who you are,' I whispered to Speed. 'That's a true horse.'\""}, {"userName": "Nina Test", "userReviewDate": "Apr 25, 2018", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/45537194-nina-test", "userReview": "This was a cute contemporary story with characters that contained passion, strength, and love.

She's grown up around them and now works at a stable in her free time and feels completely alive while she's there, especially when spending time with her favorite horse, Speed. When the owners of the stable decide that the elderly horse needs to be put down, Hattie knows she can't allow that to happen. Hattie and her best friend Delores, a girl with serious problems of her own, set off on one unique road trip. Mission? Set Speed free and allow him to be a real horse for whatever time he has left. They meet several different people along the way, horse lovers themselves, each taking a place in Speed's ultimate story and in the girl's lives.I LOVED the writing. Not really a \"horse book\" person, I wasn't sure how into the story I would get, but the emotion just pours off the page. It's one of those books that just oozes heart and I'm a sucker for those. You know instantly that Hattie isn't simply some crazy kid determined to have an adventure, but that she wants the best thing for a horse that has given her so much. She's also fairly realistic, a quality I appreciated, and realizes that Speed is elderly and knows she's taking a big risk for the possibility of a very small amount of time for him. Not just a horse story, each of these girls are dealing with some serious personal demons, adding to the reasons that neither were sad to leave home. Those \"issues\" are blended seamlessly into the road trip/horse plot and left me loving both girls and wanting to see them both succeed in what they set out for.I would hand this to those who love horse books, but are a bit more mature and ready to deal with the tough subjects discussed between Hattie and Delores. Obviously, non-horse lovers are also able to enjoy the story, myself being a prime example, especially if a great character-driven novel is what you're after."}, {"userName": "Brooke", "userReviewDate": "Feb 09, 2013", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/943931-brooke", "userReview": "This was fantastic!Two teen girls - 18, and 16, go on a roadtrip with an old horse. Speed was a pony at carnivals who led not such a great life. He is about to be put down by the now owners. Hattie,decides to steal with with her friend emotionally fragile friend Delores, and head West (from New Hampshire) to find a place to bring him where he can live his last days running (slowly as he is old) wild and die free. The girls also go on the road trip just for adventure. They are women going west! they tell themselves! And maybe they are really using the horse as an excuse for adventure and freedom themselves.As much as this story is about a girls relationship with a horse, it is really about the relationship between these two teen girls finding themselves on the road. Their relationship is very realistic and very well down. The writing is really poignant and touching and the characters feel very real. Theres also some really interesting and dynamic characters they meet along the way. It's a simple story, told well. Great dialogue.An animal lover would really love this. But so would any other realistic fiction readers! It's not sappy. It also feels like a story about small town girls that is very modern! * Also, I love when male writer pulls off female friendship writing so well! Nice job Joseph Monninger.However, the cover is not helping this book AT ALL. It looks like fluffy chick lit romance. And really it has a lot more substance than that! Id even say there's some subtle feminism in this.Notes- boys (cowboys), chewing tobacco,emotionally unstable/fragile/bipolar character (dolores) - otherwise totally clean. 6th grade up."}, {"userName": "Linda", "userReviewDate": "Mar 31, 2011", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/3429089-linda", "userReview": "I adored this book, and the cover does not do it justice. Two girls, 16 and 18, steal an old horse, load him into a truck and trailer heading west, hoping to turn him loose on some rangeland somewhere. Bad idea, right? I believe this book was marketed as a YA, coming of age, road trip novel. That it is, but make no mistake, it's also a horse lover's novel, and I wish that the cover reflected that. There is much to be loved about the old horse named Speed, the decisions (good and bad) involved in his care, the interesting characters the two travelers meet on their way west. But the love of horses, and the effect that horses have on people, comes through clean and strong throughout the narrative, and there were several times I actually wept while reading it. Yeah, I'm a sap, but there are some special moments that fellow horse lovers will understand. Interestingly enough, I read another book by Joseph Monninger called Hippie Chick, which was about Manatees, a sea creature in Florida (with one of the worst covers imaginable) and I loved it also. Perhaps that's why they say \"you can't judge a book by its cover.\" This is a long review, but I really liked this book, and think it deserves more recognition.

It involves two odd friends, stealing a dying horse and a cross country road trip - all laced with romance, sadness and changes. Hattie and Delores are great friends, but they are a really odd pairing. But they have one big thing in common, they are crazy about horses. Crazy enough to steal a horse that it about to be put down in hopes of giving it time, if only a day, to live life as a horse was meant to. Their adventure takes them to some strange places and through some rough patches, leaving the reader with quite an inspirational tale.I would say if you're a horse lover, give this book a shot. I enjoyed this novel, but I don't have a connection to horses, which I felt would really make the story come to life. However, even if you're like me (no connection to horses at all) I'm sure you could find some piece of the story to relate to. Actually, I was getting FREAKED OUT by how similar Hattie and Delores are to me and my friend at times, like their general randomness, love of Redsox and tendency to speak french at odd times.

I was pleasantly surprised at how thought-provoking and insightful this book was. Hattie and Delores were both characters with whom I could connect and I could understand the desire to save Speed.One of the reasons I picked up Finding Somewhere is because it looked like a short book and it was. I was disappointed that it ended so soon. The ending was well done, it's just that the entire book was well done.I love the idea of Speed being a horse and running with the other horses. We can never know as humans if horses think that way, yet through our anthropomorphizing of them we can enjoy the feeling.

The tender and sometimes tentative or confused feelings of teenagers, about their responsibility to their aging horse, their parents, their friends and brief boyfriend interests, are given the respect they deserve and the time and space to fully develop their expression.
