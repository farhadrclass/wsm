{"ratings": 15, "userreviews": [], "description": "In 1908, author John Fox Jr. published his best-selling novel The Trail of the Lonesome Pine, and with it, he brought Big Stone Gap into homes across the country. In modern times, Big Stone Gap is best known for a series of novels by hometown author Adriana Trigiani. The Gap has always been in the vocabulary of Southwest Virginians but has now taken root on the national scene for a second time in history. Big Stone Gap has since dubbed itself the Little Town with the Big Story. This story began in the 1880s with the discovery of nearby coalfields that sent Northern investors into an expansion frenzy. The town was touted as the new Pittsburgh of the South with its railroads, hotels, and vibrant business and cultural scenes.", "title": "Big Stone Gap\n      \n          (Images of America: Virginia)", "url": "https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/3779471-big-stone-gap", "average": 4.2, "cover": "https://images.gr-assets.com/books/1348078258l/3779471.jpg", "reviews": 0, "authors": [{"url": "https://www.goodreads.com/author/show/1611048.Sharon_B_Ewing", "name": "Sharon B.
