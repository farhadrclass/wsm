Fredric Stahl is an American movie star with Austrian roots. In the fall of 1938, he goes to Paris for a film shoot. The Nazis railroad him into serving as propaganda to boost their image. Furst spends the first 200 pages or so introducing an endless array of new characters, treating us to boring descriptions of various films, and taking us through tedious days on the movie set with Stahl and the film crew. The last 50 pages are more suspenseful, but it's not enough to redeem the book as a whole, especially with the puzzling element on the last couple of pages that made no sense to me. This could have been so much more exciting, given the reality of the German use of political warfare to shape public opinions and lull people into believing their intentions were peaceable. Olga Orlova's story was more interesting than Fredric Stahl's. Furst would have done well to make more use of her role in the novel."}, {"userName": "Will Byrnes", "userReviewDate": "Jun 28, 2014", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/1526851-will-byrnes", "userReview": "One of the things we enjoy most about spy stories is when a non-pro gets caught up in international intrigue. Richard Hannay in The Thirty Nine Steps (The film, of course. Yes, I know he was an intel-guy in the book) and Roger Thornhill Robert Donat as Hannay in Hitchcock\u2019s classicin North by Northwest pop immediately to mind. While our everyman in Mission to Paris may not exactly be just anyone, Frederic Stahl, a B-list movie star in Paris for a shoot, is, by virtue of his profession, a person of influence. (I see Mads Mikkelsen as Frederic, and yes, I know he is Danish)It is 1938, and Paris is a place where influence and propaganda are manifestations of war by other means. Stahl is targeted by the Nazi propaganda machine, looking to use his renown to help put a reassuring face on their particular brand of unpleasantness. Baronness Maria Von Reschke, the dragon lady hostess of a local and notorious salon, invites him to stop by and hob nob with the rich and Hitlerian. When she is not busy ordering the help around, she passes the time facilitating Nazi intel activities in France. No introductions necessaryWe know what lies ahead, and most of the characters in the story know what is coming, but no one can prevent the inevitable. However, the Americanized Stahl (born in Austria to an Austrian mother and Slovenian father, but now a Tinsel Town resident), eager to prove his loyalty, is responsive when the American consul asks for his help. He accepts the odd Reichian offer or two at the behest of the diplomat, hoping to use the users to good purpose. Furst populates his tales with an array of fun characters and MtP is no exception. There are bug-eyed Nazi fanatics, contract killers, kidnappers, a Russian intel source, a honey-pot siren, and an entire, colorful cast for the film Stahl is actually making. I quite enjoyed this lineup. There is even a legit love interest for our hero. Mads about Paris?One of the things Furst does best is create a feel for the time and place. And he is particularly fond of Paris. You will have no trouble at all mentally slapping on a beret, lighting up a Galoise and heading out for a nice bowl of potage du l'oignon. We are also treated to a few sidetrips. These include Berlin, a filming in Morocco, along with a bit of intrigue and a murder, another location shoot in Hungary, with a resident count (no, not that one) and a few more for good measure. All the locales are fun in their own way. Furst is economical and effective in depicting place and setting moods, in this case imminent peril, rising international tension, and, on occasion, romance. There is only the rare bit of comic relief in Mission to Paris, but I warn you there is one scene near the end that might cause you to shoot your Mo\u00ebt out your nose. The authorMission to Paris is hardly high literature, but it does not pretend to be. It is a historical spy novel that offers a bit of intel on what was going on at the time. You will definitely learn a thing or two, and get a feel for the political atmosphere of Paris during the buildup to World War II. The politics of funding the Maginot Line is fascinating. The pretext used by the Nazis to organize Krystallnacht is alarming, and will feel familiar. Some detail on the use of sand in Parisian war preparations is surprising. And a very personal motivation for the Warner Brothers Studio\u2019s antipathy to De Fuehrer comes into play. Mostly, though, Mission to Paris is top notch entertainment, a classic, rip-roaring spy novel that you will put down only grudgingly, maybe if you spot someone in the shadows pointing a luger at your head. And while it makes a perfect summer read, I see it more as filling a rainy autumn afternoon, ingested with a warm cup of your favorite liquid at hand, as you race through the pages, a throw over your lap and legs, a fire in a hearth, and if you are very, very lucky, an eyeful of tower in your line of sight. Mission to Paris is the twelfth volume in Furst\u2019s Night Soldiers series. I received this book through the Goodreads FurstFirstReads program. It was released a year ago, so an unusual FirstReads item. Furst has a new one just out, Midnight in Europe. No doubt sending a few extra copies of MtP into the world is intended to encourage readers to check out the new one. I know I want to. The new one may or may not live up to Furst\u2019s high standard, but one thing is for sure. We\u2019ll always have Mission to Paris.Review Posted \u2013 July 11, 2014Publication date - 7/4/2013=============================EXTRA STUFFHere is a wonderful piece on Furst in the Wall Street Journal.

The front covers with the old black and white photographs of dark alleys and stairwells of old Europe look irresistible to me. It instantly reminds me of the classic black & white Noir film, the Third Man, which is one of my favorite films. This new book, Mission to Paris, is the twelfth in Furst\u2019s Night Soldiers series which all follow separate plots concerning different characters and setting before or after World War II. Yet, after doing a little research on the author, I discovered that none of his books really appear to be superior to the others. Everybody seems to have their own favorite so I wasn\u2019t quite sure where to start. To my luck, Mission to Paris was released just as I was preparing to enter Alan Furst\u2019s world of dark alleys, Nazis, and chilling suspense. After finishing Mission to Paris, I thought that Furst\u2019s new additional to Night Soldiers was a pretty good read. Is it a classic? Well, no. I believe that all of his novels will have a similar feel and, over time will seem to blend together. But did I enjoy it? Yes, very much so. I can\u2019t wait to return to the Night Solders world. I believe Furst is so well researched on the topic that he makes the characters, the settings, and the suspense very believable. This author has a talent for drawing the reader into the tension of one of the most uncertain periods in modern history."}, {"userName": "Julie Christine", "userReviewDate": "Apr 13, 2012", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/1213607-julie-christine", "userReview": "Jeepers, what a tough review to write. It's that 3-star curse: \"I liked it just fine, thank you, Ma'am.\" My literary passions were neither inflamed nor offended, but I was happily entertained. And sometimes that's all I need from a read: an escape. And if it comes in a package of sublimely crafted settings that conjure from history's clouds the darkening heart of 1938-39 Europe, with characters rendered as precisely as wood-block prints (\"He was about fifty, Stahl guessed, with the thickening body of a former athlete and a heavy boyish face. He might be cast as a guest at one of Jay Gatsby's parties, scotch in hand, flirting with a debutante.\") and a quietly simmering plot, well, Bob's your uncle and I'm your girl. My hesitation to wax more enthusiastic is that I've been gobsmacked by Alan Furst's novels. The characters smoldered, the plots stole the breath, the thriller in \"historical thriller\" sent the spine a-tingle. It feels as if Furst approached Mission to Paris with tenderness and affection, both for his beloved City of Lights and for his Cary Grant-inspired leading man, Frederic Stahl. The soft-focus lighting on the characters and setting may have smoothed the sharp edge of tension found in his earlier works. This is cinema-ready, just like its stars, character actors, and picture-postcard settings.

Of the two more recent ones, I loved the Warsaw novel but the Balkans one was less interesting for some reason; this one was excellent and while Dark Star is still Furst supreme and one of the best ever pre-WW2 novels I've read, this is top tier; a lot of predictability true but still very enjoyable as character and atmosphere rather than action of which is generally little, are Furst strong pointsAgain full review in due time but if you read the latest 3-4 Furst novels (especially Blood of Victory, Dark Voyage, Spies of Warsaw) you will recognize the themes - relatively successful and charismatic male lead, femme fatale(s), less glamorous but more intellectual woman as main attraction, the dangerous spying game against the Nazis, the quiet assassins, the well meaning but unable to do too much officially persons of importance, the Balkan corruption and of course here Paris is as much a star as the main characters and we get too see a movie production to boot too.Full FBC Rv below:\"It is the late summer of 1938, Europe is about to explode, the Hollywood film star Fredric Stahl is on his way to Paris to make a movie for Paramount France. The Nazis know he\u2019s coming\u2014a secret bureau within the Reich Foreign Ministry has for years been waging political warfare against France, using bribery, intimidation, and corrupt newspapers to weaken French morale and degrade France\u2019s will to defend herself.For their purposes, Fredric Stahl is a perfect agent of influence, and they attack him. What they don\u2019t know is that Stahl, horrified by the Nazi war on Jews and intellectuals, has become part of an informal spy service being run out of the American embassy in Paris.\"INTRODUCTION: Alan Furst is the acclaimed author of the Night Soldiers cycle of novels that mostly take place during the late 1930's and the early 1940's. The novels are all standalone except for a pair that follows the same main character, a small time French businessman/crook who becomes a Resistance hero, but they tend to cross-pollinate with secondary characters, places and events in common. Actually, Night Soldiers, the first novel in the cycle and which gave its title, is a little different as the main hero, a Bulgarian waiter in Paris (and many other things, but as a waiter he participates in an event that sort of resonates throughout all the 12 novels to date) starts relatively young and green and the action follows him to the end of the war, but the rest of the novels tend to have older men - late 30's to late 40's - as heroes, of different nationalities (Polish, Italian, French, Russian, Bulgarian, Greek, Italian, Austrian-American) all pretty accomplished in a way or another, with a taste for sophisticated and interesting women and who are mostly civilian - journalists, diplomats, navy captains, the small time businessman/crook mentioned above and the actor in the blurb here, though there are a few professionals too like the French intelligence officer in The Spies of Warsaw or the Greek policeman in Spies of the Balkans.The books take place all over Europe - again the titles are pretty indicative of that and I can safely say that we get to see most of Europe in that crucial 1937-1940/1 period, though Paris plays the role of the positive attraction pole of the series, with Nazi Germany its dark opposite. The women of the series are also quite interesting - while none of the books features a female lead, there are a lot of very important women in the books, both as spies and event manipulators on their own as well as participants in the heroes' adventures and intrigue. Finally the bad guys tend to be mostly crude and arrogant but not stupid Nazis and their tools, though of course corrupt politicians, businessmen and Stalinist executioners populate the books also. I have read all 12 novels in the series so far, the first few in the late 90's when I discovered this wonderful author and the rest on publication and these books are of three kinds: pretty good, very good and superb, with Dark Star being on my all time favorite lists as one of those \"read and read again and still want to read it another time novels\" that populate that list.At various times in the past several years, I planned to do an overview of the series and I hope this introduction will entice you to check the books especially that they can be read in pretty much any order except for the \"duology\" mentioned above.OVERVIEW/ANALYSIS: After the lengthy introduction above I could do a one paragraph review of Mission to Paris: top-tier Furst with a return to the non-pro agent (an Austrian-American actor) like in Blood of Victory or Dark Voyage. Relatively successful and charismatic male lead, the femme fatale who competes for his attention with ulterior motives, the less glamorous but more intellectual woman as main attraction, the dangerous spying game against the Nazis, game including a successful Russian emigre actress who walks on a knife's edge in the Nazi leaders lair, the quiet assassins, the well meaning but unable to do too much officially persons of importance, the Balkan corruption and of course here Paris is as much a star as the main characters and we get too see a movie production to boot too.However let me add a few more details. Mission to Paris actually starts with a minor French bureaucrat who realizes his grave mistake in trying to cheat his Nazi masters of a good sum of money and then his bumbling attempts to escape their retribution give us the first view of some of the main villains of the piece, Nazi executioners Herbert and Lothar; the quote below should give you the first idea why Alan Furst's prose is so successful in its quiet understated way:\"Slim, well-dressed, quiet, Herbert made no particular impression on anybody he met, probably he was some kind of businessman, though he never quite got around to saying what he did. Perhaps you\u2019d meet him again, perhaps you wouldn\u2019t, it didn\u2019t particularly matter. He circulated comfortably at the mid-level of Berlin society, turning up here and there, invited or not\u2014what could you do, you couldn\u2019t ask him to leave.\"After this interlude we start with the main story and our hero, Frederic Stahl, makes his apparition on a liner that sails the Atlantic between America and France. \"It was true that he\u2019d \u201cwandered about the world.\u201d The phrase suggested romance and adventure\u2014something like that had appeared in a Warner Bros. publicity bio\u2014but it didn\u2019t tell the whole story. In fact, he\u2019d run away to sea at the age of sixteen. He was also not really \u201cFredric Stahl,\u201d had been born Franz Stalka, forty years earlier in Vienna, to a Slovenian father and an Austrian mother of solidly bourgeois families resident in Austria-Hungary for generations. ...It was said of him by those who made a living in the business of faces and bodies that he was \u201ca very masculine actor.\u201d Stahl wasn\u2019t sure precisely what they meant, but he knew they were rich and not for nothing. It referred, he suspected, to a certain inner confidence, expressed by, among other things, a low-pitched voice\u2014assurance, not just a bass register\u2014from an actor who always sounded \u201cquiet\u201d no matter how loudly he spoke. He could play the sympathetic lawyer, the kind aristocrat, the saintly husband, the comforting doctor, or the good lover\u2014the knight not the gigolo.\" Why would such a successful Hollywood actor come to Europe in 1938 when the dark clouds are evident to anyone? Well, we immediately see some hints - what Jack Warner wants, Jack Warner gets - and from there the book just rolls and I simply could not put it down till the end. The loving descriptions of Paris and its high life in which Frederic is soon co-opted is definitely part of the attraction, but the novel also moves to Berlin, North Africa and even Hungary and Romania, so we cover quite a lot of territory physically too. Frederic Stahl starts quietly as almost literally the cliche American uninterested in Europe's troubles - despite his heritage, Frederic is content to be the good \"quiet\" American - but his distaste for the Nazi brutalities soon gets amplified when he is confronted directly with their unsubtle attempts to \"recruit\" him to do their PR and from there he is \"in\" the direct opposition game, but the question of \"can he get out\" becomes paramount as the pressure ratchets up...Mission to Paris (top 25 novel of 2012) is vintage Furst and among his best work in the series, while being a good starting point for people not familiar with the wonderful world of Night Soldiers!"}, {"userName": "Alex Cantone", "userReviewDate": "Dec 29, 2017", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/48050946-alex-cantone", "userReview": "Mission to Paris is the twelfth spy thriller by American author / journalist Alan Furst. The scene is Paris, on the eve of World War II. Hollywood actor Frederic Stahl (born Franz Stalka, in Vienna) has been sent to Paris by Jack Warner to play the lead role in a European production. From the outset he is drawn into intrigue from Nazi sympathizers, wanting to exploit his celebrity status. Between filming he is coerced into flying to Berlin as guest judge of a German mountain film festival, where he meets the actress Olga Orlova, spying for her Russian masters while selling secrets to western powers\u2026In Stahl\u2019s Hollywood world, only the \u00e9migr\u00e9s \u2013 the studio violinist from Germany, the make-up woman from Roumania, the scene painter from Hungary \u2013 followed European politics and the miseries of European Jews and communists and intellectuals.

Beautifully illustrated with a map of the time of the Arrondissements 1 \u2013 20 in Paris, this is a thoughtful, well-researched spy thriller that I would recommend to anyone with an interest in Europe."}, {"userName": "Lance Charnes", "userReviewDate": "Jun 18, 2013", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/7296900-lance-charnes", "userReview": "Mission to Paris is an Alan Furst production, which should, by now, tell you everything you need to know about it: interwar European intrigue, a morally compromised milieu, atmospheric settings sketched with the lightest touch, buckets of research made to look effortless. His novels take place in a world in which cocktail parties and dinners happen every night, every man has at least one mistress, and the main characters smoke Gauloises and say smart things and have a je ne sais quoi you might expect from upper-caste Europeans on the eve of World War Two.Yes, all that\u2019s here. But as I read more of these, I\u2019ve come to notice something else: not only does Furst get huge mileage out of reusing his research, he\u2019s also reusing his story devices. Let\u2019s go down the checklist for Mission. Privileged hero with a complex past, na\u00efve in the ways of espionage: Check. In this case, Frederic Stahl (a Paul Henreid type), a successful Hollywood actor who is also an Austrian \u00e9migr\u00e9.Small, quick, voracious sex interest for the privileged hero: Check. In this case, with the added bonus of having a burlesque name (Kiki de Saint-Ange). Furst apparently has a thing for petite, small-breasted, oversexed women, because pretty much all his male leads do, too.Mature love interest for the privileged hero, also with a complex past: Check. Also to type, this character is physically the opposite of the small, quick, voracious sex interest, but the hero finds her equally irresistible. I believe this character is a sop to Mrs. Furst.Hero\u2019s socially high-flying mentor in the ways of espionage: Check. To Furst\u2019s credit, in Mission this character is only somewhat more wise, rather than being Yoda as usual.A risky trip into the Heart of Evil: Check. Stahl goes to Berlin, on Kristallnacht, no less.A desperate train trip through the Balkans: Check. Romanian and Bulgarian trains also consistently suck. The border guards remain flexible in their work practices.Fleeing (or attempting to flee) to Istanbul on a steamer across the Black Sea: Check. Sometimes (not here) the Aegean stands in for the Black Sea. Extra credit given if the voyage continues to Lisbon (as it does here).As you can see, all the essential Furstian elements are here. Is this bad? Not necessarily. A similar list can be ginned up for nearly every genre series, and it usually includes all the things that fans most love about the series. However, like any series, it can leave loyal readers wondering from time to time, \u201cDid I already read this one?\u201d And at a certain level of abstraction, the answer is, of course, yes.If you haven\u2019t read Furst before, Mission to Paris (his latest effort) is a fast and pleasant introduction to his world, worthy of four stars. If you have read his previous works, fear not; you\u2019ll find nothing startling or uncomfortable here. You\u2019ll have to decide how you feel about that prospect. I\u2019m ready to see how well Furst can handle something new; pre-WWI Europe, for example, or Cold War Eastern Europe. As a result, I feel just around three stars about Mission, and wish I could remember whether I\u2019ve read it before."}, {"userName": "Gerald", "userReviewDate": "May 09, 2016", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/75671-gerald", "userReview": "In the years just before WWII broke out in Europe, Warner Bros. loans movie star and leading man Frederic Stahl to a Parisian film studio. Born in Vienna, Stahl speaks English, French, and German. He becomes a reluctant messenger to power brokers in Berlin as the Nazis prepare to unleash their plan. He's a kind of double agent, because the Germans think he's working for them.Mission to Paris is more of a love story than a spy thriller, perhaps because its main character is more lover than spy. He has a girlfriend who looks like a starlet, but his true love turns out to be a plain-faced \u00e9migr\u00e9 who sews costumes.The remarkable thing about this book is its insight into the mood of the times. Remembering the horrors of the first war, many of the French are eager to accommodate the Germans, who are pretending they will play nice with everybody.

Furst describes vicious and thorough Nazi political espionage efforts to demoralize France and convince them of the futility of fighting. Needless to say, it worked. When the Nazis invaded, France gave up after 5 weeks. The story is told around the making of a movie, a plot device Furst has used before, and one which works well here. My only complaint is the wrap-up at the end, which I thought was done too quickly and was not totally convincing. There was one historical issue I want to read more about. Furst presents the French as knowing the Maginot line was incomplete and that the Germans could easily go around it through Belgium, which they later did.

Determined to avenge the ignominy of Versailles, the German Foreign Ministry seeks to destabilize the already fragile French Third Republic by co-opting willing and unwilling fifth columnists to do their bidding. It was a cold war designed to soften the French before the onslaught of the real war that everyone seemed to know was coming. That is the historical back drop for Alan Furst's new novel, \"Mission to Paris.\"Furst comes from a line of writers that can be traced back to both Graham Greene and Eric Ambler. Like Ambler, Furst often takes an unassuming, or unwitting civilian and immerses him in a world of mystery and intrigue in pre-World War II Europe. Mission to Paris follows this format and Furst does it in such a masterful way that I think it fair to say that Furst truly is worthy of the comparison to Ambler. He stands on his own now and really does not need to be compared to anyone to establish his bona fides.Mission to Paris is set (as the title suggests) in Paris with side-trips to Berlin, Morocco, and Hungary. The unwitting protagonist is one Fredric Stahl. Born in Austria, Stahl made his way to California as a young man and is now one of Hollywood's leading men. He is sent to Paris by his studio head Jack Warner to do a movie with an international cast. The German foreign ministry has decided that Stahl should be enlisted to aid them in their cause and that sets up the story to follow.I think it unwise to get into plot details so I'll simply state that Furst's strong point has always been how he sets the scene. His descriptions of the streets of Paris and Berlin reek of authenticity. Similarly, Furst has a keen eye for the inner life of his protagonists. Almost invariably Furst manages to convey a real sense of how those protagonists think and feel. Both of these elements of his writing generally dominate his plotting and are primarily responsible for getting the reader to turn to the next page. In this instance, Furst takes a frog in the pot of water approach to his story. Stahl's introduction to the dark world of Germany's `political cold warfare' is set on low and finally brought to a boil. Stahl's reactions to the heat being turned up is handled exceptionally well. The story kept me engaged and the ending was very well done.In addition to Stahl, Furst introduces us to a very well-drawn cast of characters, especially that of Olga Orlova. Orlova, a Russian \u00e9migr\u00e9 living in Berlin is reputed to be Russian novelist Mikhail Lermontov's daughter. A film star in Germany she is known to be on of Hitler's favorite actresses. She may or may not be everything she appears to be and Stahl's relationship with her is one of the keys to the plot. This was of particular interest to me because it appears clear that Orlova is based on the very real Olga Chekhova, Anton Chekhov's niece, a well-known actress in pre-war Germany and quite likely a Soviet spy. In my 2004 review of historian Anthony Beevor's excellent The Mystery of Olga Chekhova I noted that the real Olga's story reminded me \"of the noir-like novels of Alan Furst, whose tales of Soviet espionage and counter-espionage center on tales of similar acts of espionage taken on by Russian and other East European \u00e9migr\u00e9s in the 1930's and 1940's\". Needless to say I was delighted by this coincidence and it confirmed for me what I always suspected, that Furst's attention to historical detail is very strong.Ernest Hemingway once said that \"[I]f you are lucky enough to have lived in Paris as a young man, then wherever you go for the rest of your life it stays with you, for Paris is a moveable feast.\" Alan Furst's \"Mission to Paris\" is a moveable feast in its own right.

Even before he arrives both Germany and France are subtly vying for his loyalty. Though he left Germany for America many years ago he\u2019d still been sucked into World War I working as a desk clerk. The more he explores the Paris of 1938 the more he begins to loathe the Germans with their hierarchical structure with Hitler and his minions, of course, at the top. The threats become less and less veiled and not just for Fredric. The Parisians are scared, trying not to be noticed in any way by the Germans; they want to get on with their daily routines but the Germans become more menacing. Stahl meets a politically ambiguous but beautiful socialite and then a free thinking German Jewish expatriate and his outlook begins to be clearer about his political stance if not his love life. He came overseas feeling thoroughly American and wanting to stay out of the war but learns that\u2019s not possible in Europe. Things climax when he and the film crew head to Hungary for location work. No one has the luxury of being unaffiliated on German soil. Though the place and setting is turbulent this is a fairly sweet story with lots of atmosphere. Furst makes it clear Europe felt at war long before guns were fired. And America was enticed by both totalitarian Germany and Democratic Europe to join one cause or the other cause. There are some fascinating tidbits of 1930\u2019s Hollywood included.

Perhaps, I was hoping Mission to Paris would be grittier, but it seems like Furst was more interested in telling this pre-WWII spy novel in the tone and style of a Cary Grant/Gary Cooper movie script. Stahl is a pawn in a political/spy/war game between big power; a lover of a lot of attractive and dangerous women; a reluctant hero, a smoldering spy. Yeesh.

I'll just get straight onto the experience if you don't mind.This was an easy enough read, generally delivered on the grimy sepia vignettes but seemed somewhat aimless. It meandered between scenes, never really getting up a head of steam and yet never really failing anywhere.Mind you, if the bloody bullet-marked mirror in the Cafe Heininger in Paris gets mentioned in another Furst book I'm going to do something desperate. Okay, you found a nice piece of colour, Alan - but in every single book? Really?I'm not so sure one of us doesn't need a change. I serially read three of Furst's books, this was the second. That's never a good idea, really, it's unfair to the author.

Liked the earlier novels a lot. Immensely, to be honest. Finally someone writing about the period with subtlety and insight. But the last couple--and especially this one--were disappointing. \"Mission to Paris\" often reads like Harlequin romance schtick aimed at male readers (no, and that ain't me, as you might guess). The protagonist, an Austrian-Slovenian-born actor who now takes the name \"Stahl,\" is never in serious jeopardy, in fact, if it can be believed, Furst actually writes him out of danger, leaving him behind to (inconsequential spoiler alert) guard the boat while everyone else goes off to defend him. Even more distressing, a long journey to safety with his amour which cries out for some wonderful Furstian intrique is thrown away in a few sentences-cum-dustbin. And, yes, this is really a minor point, a small matter only of the title of a mountain-film flick in German, but it's \"der Berg,\" not \"das Berg,\" as written, and the use of syntax is also incorrect. Visiting a web site like \"Leo\" and typing \"Berg\" in the query box would have easily cleared up the first error, and I might have forgiven the second, although it did break the mood. More to the point: Doesn't he think his readers might care as much for period detail as he does--or did? Perhaps the series has jumped the shark (as they say of series television,) and the author should look for a new angle from which to display his considerable talent.

Though, as this is so good, maybe it would be better to start elsewhere and save this pleasure? Hard to decide how to recommend it best. It really is a summation of all his strengths, all his subtitles. The perfect place to start, the perfect place to carry on from.A deceptively simple story - all the best are - and American movie star, Frederic Stahl agrees, at his studio\u2019s prompting, to make a movie. In Paris. In 1939. Of course, we know now that that probably wasn\u2019t the best idea the studio, or he, ever had, but it was back then. Though, and as you might have guessed from the spelling of his name, Stahl isn\u2019t your typical American movie star. If there is, or was, such a thing. Anyway, Stahl is a movie star in America now, but began his life in Vienna, born into \u2018intelligentsia,\u2019 though at the age of 17 he ran away to sea. A ship took him to America, then his looks took him to Hollywood. Hollywood sent him to Paris to make a movie. He is 'hot property' in more ways than one, as he soon finds out. Not just to the party, wining and dining, cocktail and cafe-society, but also to the intelligence agencies. On both sides of the yet to be declared, but every one knows is coming, conflict. You can\u2019t say \u2018war\u2019 because no one - with the possible exception of Berlin - knew if there\u2019d be a war or not. Obviously, everyone (with the exception of Berlin) hoped it wouldn\u2019t come to that, but the sense of it being the last dance for the Parisian society, the foreboding, the hidden - and not so hidden - threat of a mighty power finding it will not, and probably cannot, be opposed, is handled to perfection by Furst. Stahl, is knowingly or unknowingly more and more entwined by forces he knows he doesn\u2019t and shouldn\u2019t want to be entwined by. As a film star, his value to the Nazis is immense, they can justify their regime by using him. They invite him to Berlin, to a film competition. He knows he shouldn\u2019t go. But he also knows that while it is just an invitation, it\u2019s one he can't refuse. There will be 'consequences.'. However, by being used by the Nazis, he finds he is then making himself valuable to the American intelligence services. He can, as a still neutral American, go pretty much where he likes in Europe. As an American with a European past, he finds out different. All Stahl wants to do, is revisit the Parisian haunts of his youth, be wined, dined and partied by the hight society he once stood on the outside of, finish the film - and get his end away with the wardrobe mistress.As an aside, if you\u2019ve read any David Downing - if not, why not?! - you\u2019ll recognise some of the places Stahl visits while in Berlin. At around the same time as the John Russell books too. I half expected them to bump into each other at the Adlon bar!This is the perfect showcase for all Alan Fursts talents. The complete Furst. By turns slow, reflective, ordinary, tense, erotic and passionate. Light, dark and sometimes dangerous. And more. I\u2019d have to put it way out in front the best Furst I\u2019ve read so far. It has everything all his other novels have in parts, distilled in total. Beautifully well written, perfectly paced. Perfection on the page.

It is a dangerous, difficult, seductive time: Europe is about to explode, and the Parisians are living every night as though it were their last. As filming progresses, Stahl is drawn into a clandestine world of foreign correspondents, embassy officials, and spies of every sort. His engagements take him from the bistros of Paris to the back alleys of Morocco; from a Hungarian castle to Kristallnacht, and the chilling heart of the Third Reich. But can he survive as German operatives track him across Paris? Gripping, haunting, and deeply passionate, Mission to Paris is the ultimate portrait of a people at war and Alan Furst's most panoramic, lovingly described, and finest book to date.My first Alan Furst book and it was an absolute cracker. I have a lot of his earlier work sat around at home unread, but on the basis of this offering, hopefully for not too much longer. Furst\u2019s Mission To Paris is set \u2013 guess where? Paris in 1938. Our hero, Fredrik Stahl, an Austrian by birth and a successful actor in LA is making a film in Europe. Returning to Paris, after some years away, he becomes immersed in the manipulations and machinations of Parisian society. His presence in the city is seized upon by none too subtle Nazi elements that seek to use him to advance their cause. Stahl, unsympathetic to their aims, tries to avoid becoming a stooge for the Germans in the war being fought in the press about the French government\u2019s preferred stance towards Hitler. Opt for appeasement and hope he leaves them be? Or stand up to the playground bully in the near certain knowledge that French resistance on its own would be easily overcome by the German military machine.This is where I struggle with my reviews generally, how much detail do I put in, how much do I leave out? Furst masterfully portrays a conflicted society and city; factions embracing the impending era of Nazi dominance and endeavouring to speed its ascent, factions fearful of the changes to come and the ever-invasive dread of what Nazism will mean for their families and friends, many of them having departed Germany previously in terror at the growing right-wing menace.Furst\u2019s Stahl was a realistic and compelling hero. Overcoming his initial reservations, he is increasingly drawn into a shadowy world of espionage, trying to provide a conduit for information between Americans anxious to influence the President at home regarding the German menace and practical support for agents on the ground in Berlin, at the risk to his public persona. Before too long the stakes are raised and Stahl is sucked into not just a battle to preserve his career, but his life and that of the woman he has fallen for. Intelligent and educational, gripping, exciting and scary; this was one of the best books I\u2019ve read in the past year or so, let alone this month.5 from 5 I borrowed my copy form my local library in Leighton Buzzard.https://col2910.blogspot.co.uk/2013/0..."}, {"userName": "Judith Starkston", "userReviewDate": "Jul 23, 2012", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/4596767-judith-starkston", "userReview": "Set in 1938 in Paris, this spy thriller reveals an interesting chapter in history. America had no CIA or equivalent intelligence agency. Roosevelt had the foresight to realize he had to prepare for the inevitable war, so he used his extensive personal relationships to collect intelligence on the Nazis and funded this work with private donors. Frederic Stahl, the main character of Mission to Paris, is a movie star with no training in being a spy, but while in Paris making a movie he becomes one. He\u2019s from Vienna originally so the Nazi propagandists in Paris assume that he will contribute willingly in their political warfare to undermine the French people. They assumed wrongly, but Stahl is encouraged by a state department diplomat to play along with their plans as a cover. And we are off in an intriguing mire of trouble that, as you might guess, escalates beyond Stahl\u2019s control very quickly.Stahl is not by nature a spy sort of person. He\u2019s good with the ladies, but no James Bond. When things go wrong, he doesn\u2019t instantly see the creative escape nor does violence occur to him at first. In the face of cold-blooded killing, he responds with shock. In other words, Furst has avoided all the spy clich\u00e9s and created a believable character. Just don\u2019t expect action-packed pages or not in the nail-biting, page-ripping mode. Lots happens, danger threatens, and sometimes bursts out, but you\u2019ll have time as a reader to weigh the characters\u2019 choices along with them, trace the strands, and anticipate the disasters that may or may not come about. Furst plays with stereotypes of Paris. His setting moves in and out of the expected. Sometimes the food, the romances, the elegance are all deployed with charming and entertaining effect\u2014the delightful Paris we all think we know. Other times, we witness a darker Paris, both in terms of seamier neighborhoods and in terms of Parisian character. The people seem ill equipped to combat the insidious Nazi machine that is eating away at their hearts and minds and will soon drive over them with tanks. What of the grace Furst has also depicted will survive? For the characters that\u2019s very much an open question and for us, immersed in this moment, we are able to feel the precipice, inch our toes forward and wonder once again if the world will plunge off irrevocably into the Nazi\u2019s grim vision."}, {"userName": "Joe", "userReviewDate": "Jul 12, 2016", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/25882000-joe", "userReview": "Furst\u2019s books are billed as World War II historical thrillers.

Furst\u2019s protagonists are on the fringe of the war, battling Nazi Germany one day at a time, against incredible odds, staying just one step ahead of apprehension and are not your stereotypical heroes.Mission To Paris, the author\u2019s 12th novel, follows this formula. Our hero, Viennese born Franz Stalka, is a Hollywood film star known to the movie watching public as Frederic Stahl. \u201cOn loan\u201d from his studio, Stahl is filming on location in Paris in the autumn of 1938 \u2013 The Munich Pact and Kristallnacht in the background.

He is head and shoulders above anyone writing spy novels today possibly excepting John Le Carre'. As I've said in previous reviews, he has taken the spy novel to the level of contemporary literature. This effort is no exception.The protagonist, Hollywood film star Fredric Stahl, born in Vienna but now a permanent resident of the U.S. is sent to Paris in late 1938 to make a movie for Paramount Studios on loan from Warner Bros. Upon arriving in Paris he is immediately contacted by a number of People who are part of an effort by a bureau of the Reich Foreign Office dedicated to degrading France's will to fight.The Germans and their sympathizers see Stahl as an excellent agent of influence. They don't realize he is horrified by what Germany has become and decides to become part of an informal spy service being run out of the American embassy in Paris.Furst has great skill in developing characters. Whether major or minor, good or evil, they are believable and human. From corrupt newspaper reporters to the rich and famous to assassins and spies as well as the cast and company of the movie, \"Apres Le Guerre\", all play their parts seamlessly and add to the incredible realism Furst elicits. Paris is, in some ways, one of the major characters. Stahl had lived there earlier as a penniless actor and he has never forgotten the magic of the city. As the story unfolds the reader is transported back in time to a pre-war Paris populated by mostly frightened individuals hoping for the best. Whenever I read a Furst novel, I am transported to a different time and place. I am in awe of his ability to reconstruct the context of the times and bring me into the story in a way few authors are capable of doing.I highly recommend this book, especially to those who have never had the pleasure of experiencing Furst's talent.

Nonetheless--and Mission to Paris is no exception\u2014we are absorbed because Furst is a master of atmosphere, we feel the suspense, and the details of each book are just different enough to provide some fresh variation on the familiar story.

The Nazi operatives also use unsavory tactics to silence French voices warning of the danger of a German invasion.

(Furst has a fascination with pre-WW2 movie industry and this is featured in several other novels in the series) Stahl is stalked by Nazi propagandists from the Buro Ribbentrop who want to use him to highlight the glories of Nazi Germany. Suspense and complications ensue as the plot moves around Paris (the spiritual center of the series) and then to Morocco and Hungary. All through this book as in the others the atmosphere is leaden with the sense of looming disaster. Furst is rightfully celebrated as a master of the thriller but more than anything he is also a master of mood, most especially of a mood that gripped most of the world from 1933 to 1939. Fans of Eric Ambler and Graham Greene will recognize this. These novels don't build to a pulse-pounding conclusion, they are episodic and profoundly realist and this is, for me, one of their prime attractions."}, {"userName": "Craig Pittman", "userReviewDate": "Jun 14, 2012", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/4640029-craig-pittman", "userReview": "To say that Alan Furst writes spy novels is misleading. What he writes are novels about how ordinary men and women responded to the greatest crisis to confront Western civilization in the 20th century, namely the rise of fascism in Europe. His heroes are ship's captains, mapmakers, writers, soldiers, who are pressed into service as spies and saboteurs. This book features his most unlikely hero to date, a Hollywood movie star named Fredric Stahl. Stahl, born in Austria, is now being sent to Paris on the eve of World War II to film a movie about the end of World War I. Furst doesn't play up the irony -- he doesn't have to. Stahl stumbles into a world of shadows where he's being pulled in several different directions -- the Nazis want to manipulate him into being an agent of influence for their propaganda campaign in France, while the Americans want to recruit him to help with gathering intelligence on the Nazis' activities. A few scenes in this book -- particularly one involving a German film festival that was showing 38 movies about mountaineering -- made me think that Furst had seen Quentin Tarantino's over-the-top World War II film and thought: \"I can do better.\" The plot builds its tension nicely, and Stahl's character and resolve are both tested when he falls for an emigre' who is part of the film's crew. I started off this book thinking it would be a minor entry in his oeuvre, and it still does not measure up to \"The Polish Officer\" and \"Dark Voyage.\" But as a character study with occasional gunfire, I have to say it was a pleasure to read and I enjoyed Mr. Stahl's charming company far more than I ever expected."}, {"userName": "Dave", "userReviewDate": "Aug 16, 2012", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/4226085-dave", "userReview": "I've now read three of Alan Furst's novels and conclude that he's a good writer. He tells some pretty good stories set in Europe during the '20s or '30s with the same general themes: Nazis and Fascists are bad, so are Communists except when they're fighting the Nazis, and we must have faith because the good guys will prevail. Furst does a great job with atmosphere, especially in Paris, where I kept expecting to bump into Bogey and Bergman on their way to Casablanca. He describes the weather, the buildings, the neighborhoods, the cuisine, the vehicles, the clothing, even the underwear with the perfect amount of detail. He also sets the time well. The protagonist, while enroute to Europe in September, 1938, reads the steamship line's daily news bulletin detailing numerous actual occurences, unrelated to the plot, of the previous day.My favorite feature of Furst's novels is that in addition to the general themes each one develops a different specific theme that tends to be glossed over in history texts. In Mission to Paris we read that the Germans, and Frenchmen opposed to the Socialist/Liberal governments then in power in Paris, spent a considerable amount of money to generally help facilitate a German victory. I don't think I'll start another Alan Furst novel in the near future, but it's a safe bet that I won't stay away forever."}], "description": "From the New York Times bestselling author and the \u201cmodern-day master of the genre\u201d (New York Newsday) comes a gripping novel of espionage and deception in 1938 pre-war Paris.At the center of the intrigue is Hollywood star, Frederic Stahl.
