While trying to get Andre to like Ebbie, so Stephanie can return to the present she falls in love with him.Andre is a devoted father who let's his children rule, that's until Stephanie arrives. His list for her is obvious, he often behaves as he does to get a reaction from Stephanie. He frustrated me, he drove me crazy but he made me laugh. This story was well written, however It did seem to drag in the middle, with very similar scenes that I did not find very important. That been said the ending was rushed and although it did not left any unanswered questions it did happen too rapidly for my liking. I'll definitely be reading more from the author!"}, {"userName": "Slytherin Rose", "userReviewDate": "Nov 14, 2014", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/33653432-slytherin-rose", "userReview": "Genre: Romance/Time TravelAuthor: Eugenia RileyBook: Waltz in TimeMy Star Rating: 4.5 out of 5Will I read I read it again? YesNow usually I wouldn\u2019t read a book with kids already in the picture but I didn\u2019t mind it in this book. Also, now since my husband is in the Army and has gone to war, I don\u2019t read books with the soldiers being killed in a war zone. In this book her first husband died in war, but it really didn\u2019t bother me because she didn\u2019t dwell on it. I found that I really like all the characters in this book. Andre drove me crazy but I still loved him. I do think that the ending was a little rushed but other than that it was a great love story mixed in with time travel. I loved also the area in which the author places the setting. I love old plantation homes and the deep south! I was given this book to read and give an honest review. This review is my honest opinion and I have fully read this book."}, {"userName": "Barbara \u2605", "userReviewDate": "Dec 05, 2011", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/1968285-barbara", "userReview": "Geez and to think that I used to enjoy this type of book. UGH! Stephanie is one of those TSTL heroines whom you just want to smack some sense into. And Andre is a rogue who Stephanie finds charming but I just found smarmy and sleazy. If I hadn't needed this book to complete a few challenges this month, I would definitely have given up, as it was I literally had to force myself to keep reading this utter crap.I think the problem was that I'm jaded by paranormals where ghosts are run-of-the-mill. Stephanie practically had a nervous breakdown whenever the ghost appeared which happened every few pages for about 75 pages. It just got old and irritating. This book was so bad that instead of swapping it and torturing some other poor reader, I just tossed it in the trash. Something I've rarely done and only with a book that is absolutely falling apart and unswappable."}, {"userName": "Helm Ehmy Ilarde", "userReviewDate": "Dec 28, 2012", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/15873494-helm-ehmy-ilarde", "userReview": "It's the first book I've read of this author. I must say that it's plot is refreshing to me. I am used to reading heavy plots of war and such that the book's lighter mood gives me a good feeling. But not as much as I like Constance O'Day-Flannery's Time After Time.The setting's almost similar: Modern widow falls through time to meet widower, who kinda is unable to take care of his child/children due to mourning or guilt, and the heroine never wants to go back anymore and in the end they get to stay and they lived happily ever after."}, {"userName": "Barbara Suralik", "userReviewDate": "Apr 22, 2015", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/34384094-barbara-suralik", "userReview": "Delightful romanceQuick paced read with wonderful endearing cast of characters.

It was surprising and refreshing to say the least. I think what I loved most was that it didn't include any over the top soap opera drama like crazy ex mistresses, jealous admirers, controlling relatives, or shady blackmail and murder plots thrown in just to keep it interesting. It started as romance and stayed focused on the romance which I loved. It didn't throw anything in that it didn't need. It centered on the attraction and growing feelings between Stephanie and Andre, the bond with his kids that changed from unwanted stranger to loving mother, the friendship with Ebbie who saw her as a sister and best friend, the turmoil with fighting feelings for someone who wasn't supposed to be yours and the agony of getting close to this family and hurting them with your abandonment should you be taken back to your own time against your will. All of that was in this book and there was a lot of it, if you like seeing the feelings of characters, the change that different types of love can bring to a person. This is the book. Both Stephanie and Andre were two characters that I loved and respected highly. They didn't play games with each other, not in the sense that you think. They do try to manipulate the other in certain situations like Steph trying to get him to spend time with Ebbie and see her in a different light,or Andre negotiating Steph to spend time with him if he were to do the same with Ebbie, but they didn't mess with each other's feelings or set out to hurt them. It was a game where they both got caught up if anything. Steph was one of my favorite heroines reading because she didn't come across as a blushing and bumbling idiot every time he looked at her or addressed her. She stood up to him and put him in his place when he overstepped or undermined her authority. She held her own and wasn't afraid to walk even though she had no where to go which I high-fived her for and though she had no clue how to survive in a different era. She spoke her mind to Andre and let him know that she wasn't going to fall head over heels for him as he expected her to like any other woman. She took charge of a household that desperately needed order and children who needed rules and discipline. She was firm and assertive which they needed to see. The other kids adapted right away to her but seeing the change in Gwen was beautiful to see her eventually accept Steph as a potential mother role when she was so determined to hate her at first. Andre was someone I initially didn't think I was going to like because of his arrogance, overconfident ego, and how he allowed his children to do as they pleased and pretty much run the home. Which is why I enjoyed the first days that Steph moved in because she knocked him down off his high horse and showed him that just because he was an attractive man with money that she wasn't going to bend to his will. He eventually accepted she was different, she was her own person, and wasn't going to fall for just his looks and money like many others had. He knew he had feelings for her and didn't hide them from her. What I loved most was that in the beginning it really was just attraction at first. As the book went on, it eventually grew from wanting her as a conquest that intrigued him, to an attractive, challenging, woman he wanted as a mistress, to the one he both loved and desired and loved his children as if they were her own. When he realized he loved her, he accepted it and embraced it. It didn't scare him and he tried to convince her that what they felt was right and good for both of them. The one character I didn't like was Sam, her real sister. She was whiney and blamed Steph for her problems. She even asked her to not speak about certain things so as to keep the peace with her potential mother in law. She took her sister's sincere inquires and twisted them into asking her if she's jealous. I'm assuming she was in her twenties but she acted more like a teenager with her behavior and words. Ebbie was so much more likable and much more compatible as a sister figure. Sam seemed like a modern day spoiled, bratty, teenager marrying up in the social ladder for money and stability. I didn't like her and found that Steph overlooked her faults and didn't see her sister for who she really was deep down. I'm glad that she was only in the beginning because she was not someone I'd enjoy reading about. Her character was shady and off and if she has to blame her sister for her boyfriend breaking up with her because he's a mama's boy, she doesn't deserve to have Steph in her life. This book took everything that I want in books and put it all in one. No mind games between characters, no dramatic misunderstandings, no over the top drama, and the bonus, no jealous heroine who feeds the hero's ego when she denies wanting him, sees him with another girl, confronts him with snarky remarks about said girl, while completely embarrassing herself. Stephanie was one classy, respectable woman and Andre was an enjoyable, humorous man. I'm glad I bought this book and will soon check out more of this author's other works to see how the others compare."}, {"userName": "Gemma", "userReviewDate": "Dec 13, 2010", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/4507646-gemma", "userReview": "I found the hero infuriating!From the inside front: Matchmaker's masquerade... When Stephanie Sergeant inherited a rambling old mansion in Natchez, Mississippi, she had no idea she'd have to share it with the ghost of a lovelorn Victorian spinster. Now the haunting straings of a violin disturb her sleep each night. And when she does dream, her late Great-aunt Magnolia comes to call, complaining that \"someone has to deal with that man.\" Traveling back in time to play matchmaker, Stephanie seeks to pair up the lonely spinster with a notorious Southern rogue... But she sone finds herself in the arms of a devilishly charming prospective with ideas of his own. Waltz in time... A handsome, broad-shouldered widower, Andre Goddard is thrilled to have finally found someone like Stephanie who can match his passion and fire--and who is firm, yet loving toward his five rambunctious children. Of course the headstrong woman's infuriating insitence that she has come from the future to unite Andre with his shy dowdy housekeeper is a serious obstacle to his romantic plans. And Stephanie is certain she would never give her heart to such an incorrigible rascal, even one as attractive as Andre. But the unexpected tenderness she experiences in Andre's embrace tantalizes her with the sensuous promise of love that could make time stand still for them both. And my review: Well, I kind of felt that the given synposis is a bit misleading. The hero is not happy to find a woman who is firm with his bratty children--just the opposite. He thinks that his children's every whim should be undulged, and that any punishment, even when it's deserved and necessary, is wrong. Grr. Strike one against the hero. I have absolutely zero respect for people who don't disipline their children. A person who really loves their kids will teach them boundries, or the children will grow up to by horrible, dysfunctional adults that everyone hates. Also, the synopsis states that the heroine insists that she's from the future. Yet she doesn't do that in the story--in fact, she's smart enough to realize that saying such a thing will lead to her being locked up in a madhouse. Okay, first of all, there were some things to like about this book: the time-travel aspect of it is quite well done. The author had a good balance between the heroine accepting her fate weighed with her disbelief over what had happened. Too many time-travel book either have the time-travelling character shrug off the fantastic experience all too easily, or have them never accept it. That didn't happen here. I felt that the author struck just the right balance. Also, her historical descriptions were vivid and well done without overtaking the story. Her words painted a clear picture in my head, until I felt like I was really there. Yet I never felt like I was reading a textbook. Also, the way the heroine travelled through time was both original and believeable. However, the hero was so annoying! I wanted to smack him a good one on more than one occasion. First of all, there's his total overindulgence of his kids. Even when they scare the housekeeper with a snake and put a goldfish down her dress, he just shrugs it off, saying they're only kids. Yes, but that's what parents are for--to correct improper behavior, not condone it. And I really didn't like when he turned his family into a democracy. His oldest daughter wants Stephanie to leave (because she's finally setting down limits), and he has the kids take a vote. When more kids want her to stay then go, then Stephanie is \"allowed\" to stay. Again, who is the parent here? I'd tell the kid that Stephanie is staying, that's that, and if you don't like it, tough cheese! But the hero has no backbone when it comes to his kids. As if being motherless means they can get away with murder. And he was sex-crazed. Every second thing out of his mouth was an innuendo. It wasn't sexy; it was just sleazy. The lame pick-up lines just made him come across as a shallow, hormonal loser. I hate to sound so harsh, but I just HATED him. And I couldn't cheer for him to get together with the heroine when I felt that she was far too good for him. She was the only one who knew how to properly care for children, and she wasn't even a parent! And she actually cared about other people. He cared only about himself."}, {"userName": "Teresa Vogt", "userReviewDate": "Feb 01, 2015", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/28622244-teresa-vogt", "userReview": "Be careful to sip wine you didn't see poured.This review is from: Waltz in Time (Kindle Edition)What every Romance needs, a little mystery, a little cad you wanna slap, and most of all a steamy response after the slap, kids and love.
