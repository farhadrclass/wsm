Jump forward five years and the case is still technically unsolved but anyone who has read up on it believe the trio have gotten away with murder and with the anniversary of her death approaching their lives collide and they decide its time to find her killer and clear their names once and for all and finally put the whole thing behind them. The title of this book couldn\u2019t have been better because at the very core of the novel is a very broken girl and the ripple effect of her death on those closest to her and how they too find themselves struggling to put the pieces of their lives together and move forward. A big part of this story is another book detailing the adventures of three girls into the fantasy world of Lovelorn and the snippets of that story intermixed with the fan fiction written by our three main girls really helped show the descent into madness and the disintegration of their friendship as one of them begins to blur the line between fantasy and reality making it almost impossible to pull apart the threads of her life to find the true killer lurking in the shadows. If you\u2019re a fan of Pretty Little Liars or just on the hunt for a good mystery with a bit of a book within a book counterpart this is a perfect novel for you and I really want to end this review like both of those stories did but I feel like it wouldn\u2019t really make sense but trust me when I say it\u2019s brilliant. **special thanks to the publishers and edelweiss for providing an arc in exchange for a fair and honest review!**"}, {"userName": "Eliza Rapsodia", "userReviewDate": "May 29, 2018", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/6561375-eliza-rapsodia", "userReview": "**ARC provided by Edelweiss in exchange for an honest review**REVIEW IN ENGLISHSome time ago, I read Lauren Oliver's works with the dystopian trilogy Delirium. I saw the talent she has to narrate and build characters, even though with the last book of that trilogy I was deeply disappointed. Still I requested this book to read it. And believe me, I am pleasantly surprised.Vermont, United States. The small town of Twin Lakes is still shocked by a tragic event: five years ago, Summer Marks, a thirteen-year-old girl, was murdered and the killer was never found. Her friends, Mia Ferguson and Brynn McNally, are the principal suspects and everyone blame them for it. Five years have passed but Summer's ghost is still present. Mia and Brynn are dead and alive: everyone blame them but they know they did not do it. Not knowing what happened is a question that does not let them live in peace. Until one day, Mia and Brynn meet again.Broken things is a novel with a premise that might seem typical at first, but the key is that it's a well done and interesting novel: a complex friendship, three friends, a book, a murder and a mystery.  The novel is narrated alternating the past and the present from the points of view of Mia and Brynn. We get to know them very well and through them the ghost of Summer is present, the friend who united them and separated them. When they were thirteen, Summer brought with her The Way into Lovelorn, a book that obsessed them so much that they began to write a fanfic of how the story would continue.Summer's death destroyed the lives of Mia and Brynn. Both are trapped in a spiral where everyone blames them, although they know they are not guilty. I think Lauren Oliver did a great job. Both characters are very well constructed, their voices are defined and we can understand and get to know Summer herself: a troubled girl, thirsty for love and obsessed with the fantastic story of Lovelorn.Brynn and Mia's reunion is the point when the story develops into a mistery: they will find the truth of what happened to Summer.  Other characters like Owen, Mia's old friend, Abby, Mia's new friend and Wade, Brynn's mother's cousin. Although they are not as developed as the two main protagonists, they add to the story. We are intrigued to discover the clues contained in the history of Lovelorn and if they will help to reveal the truth.Although I feel that the novel does not escape certain topics and common places in YA and I found a lack of closure in Brynn's story, I truly belive Lauren has written a good and engaging story.  She plays with the mystery, pointing the finger to certain people and their motivations. What really happened? Broken things is a well worked novel, with consistent characters; a novel that talks about love, friendship and guilt.I definitely recommend it.***************************RESE\u00d1A EN ESPA\u00d1OLHace tiempo que hab\u00eda le\u00eddo el trabajo de Lauren Oliver con la trilog\u00eda dist\u00f3pica Delirium. En ella vi el talento que ten\u00eda para narrar y construir personajes aunque al final la saga me decepcion\u00f3 hondamente. Por eso cuando estaba navegando en Edelweiss (sitio del que les hablar\u00e9 pronto),\u00a0encontr\u00e9 que este libro estaba disponible para leerlo y rese\u00f1arlo antes de su publicaci\u00f3n. No lo pens\u00e9 mucho y lo ped\u00ed para leerlo. \n  Y cr\u00e9anme que fue una grata sorpresa.\nVermont, Estados Unidos. El peque\u00f1o pueblo de Twin Lakes se vi\u00f3 conmocionado por un tr\u00e1gico suceso: \n  cinco a\u00f1os atr\u00e1s, Summer Marks, una ni\u00f1a de trece a\u00f1os, fue asesinada y no se encontr\u00f3 al responsable. \nSus amigas Mia Ferguson y Brynn McNally son las sospechosas y en ellas recay\u00f3 toda la culpa de lo que sucedi\u00f3. La amistad conflictiva de Summer, Mia y Brynn es un gran peso enlazado con\u00a0el libro que las uni\u00f3: The way into\u00a0Lovelorn.\u00a0Cinco a\u00f1os han pasado, pero el fantasma de Summer sigue presente: el no saber qu\u00e9 paso no las ha dejado vivir en paz. \n  Hasta que Mia y Brynn vuelven a reencontrarse.\nVermont, donde sucede la historia. FuenteBroken things es una novela que tiene una premisa que podr\u00eda parecer normalita al principio pero que la clave es que est\u00e1 muy bien trabajada: \n  una amistad compleja, tres amigas, un libro, un asesinato y un misterio. \nLa novela est\u00e1 narrada alternando el pasado y el presente desde los puntos de vista de Mia y Brynn. As\u00ed vamos conociendo como cada una lidia con su pasado y as\u00ed aparece el fantasma de Summer, la amiga que las uni\u00f3 y las separ\u00f3. Cuando ten\u00edan trece a\u00f1os,\u00a0\n  Summer trajo con ella el libro The way into Lovelorn, un libro con el que las tres ni\u00f1as se obsesionaron, \ntanto que empezaron a escribir un fanfic de c\u00f3mo seguir\u00eda la historia si la autora habr\u00eda escrito una segunda parte.El pasado, el presente y la muerte de Summer han destrozado las vidas de Mia y Brynn. \n  Vamos descubriendo como sus vidas han sido un desastre\n desde entonces: Brynn qued\u00e1ndose en casas de rehabilitaci\u00f3n y escapando de su familia; Mia dejando de lado lo que m\u00e1s ama, soportando las obsesiones de su mam\u00e1 y las miradas de miedo de los otros. Ambas est\u00e1n atrapadas en una espiral donde todos las culpan, \n  aunque ellas saben que no lo hicieron.\n En este aspecto creo que Lauren Oliver se luce con creces. \n  Sus dos personajes est\u00e1n muy bien construidos y trabajados, \nsus voces se distinguen y podemos entender y conocer las motivaciones de la propia Summer, personaje que cambi\u00f3 sus vidas: \n  una ni\u00f1a conflictiva, sedienta de amor y obsesionada con la historia fant\u00e1stica de Lovelorn.\nAs\u00ed las cosas la novela narra como el reencuentro de Brynn y Mia hace que decidan tomar cartas en el asunto \n  y se pongan en marcha para encontrar la verdad de lo que le sucedi\u00f3 a Summer. \nAparecen otros personajes como Owen, el antiguo amigo de Mia, Abby, la nueva amiga de Mia y Wade, el primo -primo de la madre- de Brynn. Aunque no est\u00e1n tran trabajados como las dos protagonistas, son personajes que agregan a la historia. Nos embarcamos junto a ellos en una aventura \n  para descubrir pistas contenidas en la historia de Lovelorn qu\u00e9 ayuden a esclarecer qu\u00e9 pas\u00f3, \ny eso me ha parecido el mayor gancho del libro: quieres saber como va a acabar todo.Aunque siento que la novela no escapa de ciertos t\u00f3picos del g\u00e9nero como que los j\u00f3venes pasan d\u00edas sin que sus padres sepan que hacen o donde est\u00e1n. Y que al final me falt\u00f3 algo de cierre en la historia de Brynn, creo que la historia funciona muy bien. Lauren juega con el misterio, apuntando a varios frentes y haciendo que como lector pienses y trates de deducir qui\u00e9n es el verdadero culpable. Y creo que ha sido una experiencia lectora intrigante y amena. Creo que ha sido una historia bien escrita, bien trabajada, con personajes consistentes que encierra una reflexi\u00f3n sobre la amistad, el amor, la culpa y el desamparo.Sin duda la recomiendo mucho y he vuelto a recuperar mi fe en Lauren Oliver. Maravilloso."}, {"userName": "Dylan", "userReviewDate": "May 01, 2018", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/33572178-dylan", "userReview": "3 stars. Blah.

I read VANISHING GIRLS and absolutely loved it. BROKEN THINGS intrigued me because it sounded reminiscent of the Slender Man killing back in 2014. I was fascinated with that tragic case: two twelve-year-old girls stabbed to death their friend to appease the fictional horror character Slender Man. BROKEN THINGS is similar in that Brynn and Mia were accused of killing their best friend, Summer, when they were thirteen. All because of a story they were obsessed with \u201cThe Way Into Lovelorn,\u201d about three girls in a fictional land ruled by the Shadow. Their other friend, Owen, was also charged with the murder but acquitted. We go back and forth between present day when the girls and Owen are about to enter \u201cthe real world\u201d and five years ago, the months leading up to Summer's murder. This book sucked me in from the beginning. I totally bought into the fierce and obsessive friendship the three girls had with one another. Summer was their leader, charismatic yet with a mean streak. Mia was a shy ballet dancer who was in love with Owen. Brynn was brash and in love with Summer. Their adventures together, pretending to live in the Lovelorn world and writing the sequel together, all lead to a very tragic end. The present day storyline reunites Mia, Brynn, and Owen, along with newcomers Abby and Wade, Brynn\u2019s cousin. Mia feels trapped in Twin Lakes, cleaning out her mother\u2019s hoarder house, with no plans for the future. Brynn is discharged from rehab, lost and aimless. Their reunion isn\u2019t exactly joyous as they\u2019re both trying to escape their past. Circumstances push them together regardless and they set off to find out who really killed Summer. I loved both Mia and Brynn and found both characters to be three-dimensional and real. I rooted for them to reconcile while uncovering the truth. The suspense builds with every page and I tore through the last hundred pages to find out what happened. Each time I thought I knew who the killer was, I was wrong. I never saw the end coming at all. A totally gripping, thrilling read."}, {"userName": "Amy", "userReviewDate": "May 08, 2018", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/9781252-amy", "userReview": "Many thanks to Edelweiss Plus and the publisher for providing me with an eARC of this for review. All opinions are my own.This was my first Lauren Oliver read, but it won't be my last! I was hooked from the very first chapter. The storyline, which follows Mia and Brynn, two best friends who were accused of murdering their other friend Summer weeks after her 13th birthday. Told in split narratives of Now and Then, along with excerpts from the fictionalized book about Lovelorn , a darker, more sinister version of Narnia, that the girls were intent on recreating, this is a gripping and haunting thriller. After Summer's death, Mia and Brynn are the prime suspects, along with their friend Owen, because of how the murder played out, exactly as they wrote a sacrifice scene in their fanfic sequel to the original novel. Even though the circumstantial evidence wasn't enough to convict them (or even have them stand trial) their small town holds them responsible. Now, 5 years after her death, Mia and Brynn find themselves back home together for the first time. And they decide to finally put an end to the questions and figure out what actually happened to Summer. Highly recommend for fans of books like The Naturals  or Barry Lyga's books. This is an intense thriller that has plenty of suspense and not much in the way of gore.

The YA novel tells the story of Brynn and Mia, two teenagers who were accused five years ago of murdering their troubled best friend, Summer, in a ritual that paid homage to their favorite novel about a fantastical place called Lovelorn. It has well thought-out characters, interesting points of view (it alternates between the points of view of both Brynn and Mia, both in the present and five years ago, with excerpts from the two books within the book thrown in throughout). I took off a star because aspects of the story are unbelievable or fall flat, such as the main characters\u2019 relationships to Lovelorn when they were in middle school and the ultimate conclusion. However, it is still worth a read because Oliver writes believable contemporary teens facing real, relatable issues. Secondary characters in this novel are especially enjoyable, such as Mia\u2019s vivacious friend in the present, Abby. Oliver\u2019s frank but descriptive style is always entertaining, and especially works in this novel.
