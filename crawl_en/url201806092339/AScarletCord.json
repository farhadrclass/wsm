She\u2019s left his clothes in his closet, never removing the items since his death. She finds comfort in seeing and smelling her deceased spouse\u2019s clothing. She still thinks about him, too. However, things change when Joel Ellington moves to her town. A new church member/church employee, she finds that she\u2019s attracted to him. But, Joel seems to have un-explainable secrets. Melanie also wonders about his strange reactions to certain events.Joel moves to Melanie\u2019s town to make a fresh start. Romance just can\u2019t fit into his life right now. His life is plagued with pain and secrets, but his budding feelings for Melanie are so strong. Might it be possible for him to have a normal romantic relationship with Melanie in spite of being haunted by the past?I enjoyed this book. It shows how hard it is to love somebody in spite of being haunted by tragic circumstances. Joel\u2019s love for Melanie was strong, so strong that he hesitates about his decision about having a relationship with her. Melanie has deep feelings for Joel, too. But when things shift, Melanie is plagued with solving a mystery. She\u2019s stubborn as she seeks answers to plaguing questions.http://ceceliadowdy.com/blog/2018/04/..."}, {"userName": "Alice Carter", "userReviewDate": "Mar 20, 2018", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/40487058-alice-carter", "userReview": "Deborah Rainey\u2019s books are always nice easy reads... another good story."}, {"userName": "S.campbell8655yahoo.com", "userReviewDate": "Jul 17, 2017", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/25058404-s-campbell8655yahoo-com", "userReview": "Great story !!Hard to wait until the end , even though I knew it would be a happy one !

She brings the characters to life & makes them all the type of people we can relate to one way or another.This story about pain, trust, lost love, family & work all tossed together was wonderful. I loved the main character & her daughter..the new guy working at the Church..his secret life, etc... really enjoyed this book. Great referencing to God's love & mercy..His continued presence in our daily life & every decision we make..even good scripture reference.The only reason I didn't issue 5 *****'s on this is the end...I won't ruin it and be a spoiler, but the last 2 pages were a huge disappointment. ALL I'LL say. I have another of her books to read in my Kindle Library of books..and I'll continue to read her stories.

I enjoyed the dilemma of lying to protect someone else and the conflict this causes to a Christian.

The possibility of a new relationship is the last thing on her mind. But when Melanie meets Joel Ellington, a new staff member at her church, she is instantly attracted to his warm spirit. As their friendship deepens, however, Melanie is troubled by something she can't quite understand or explain and Joel's past seems to be off-limits, even to Melanie. Because of her growing feelings for him, Melanie pushes her doubts away. But when Joel disappears, along with the contents of a church bank account, she can no longer ignore her suspicions. Now, torn between her feelings for Joel and the evidence mounting against him, Melanie faces a heart-wrenching decision: to forget the man who gave her reason to love again or to trust Joel enough to give him her heart. Exploring themes of the importance of truth, loyalty, and trust, A Scarlet Cord illustrates that who we truly are depends little on outward appearances and soley on our relationship with God, and on the fact that through faith in Him, we can find places of comfort, healing, and selfless love. This novel was originally published in 2003 under the same title, and was a Golden Quill Award finalist.", "title": "A Scarlet Cord", "url": "http://www.goodreads.com/book/show/35008415-a-scarlet-cord", "average": 4.36, "cover": "https://images.gr-assets.com/books/1493439864l/35008415.jpg", "reviews": 44, "authors": [{"url": "https://www.goodreads.com/author/show/59414.Deborah_Raney", "name": "Deborah Raney"}], "type": ["Christian Fiction", "Fiction", "Contemporary", "Christian", "Mystery"], "outlinks": ["http://www.goodreads.com/book/show/35008415-a-scarlet-cord", "http://www.goodreads.com/book/show/102871.A_Scarlet_Cord", "http://www.goodreads.com/book/show/6362059-above-all-things", "http://www.goodreads.com/book/show/20981415-because-of-the-rain", "http://www.goodreads.com/book/show/18168267-a-january-bride", "http://www.goodreads.com/book/show/417811.A_Nest_of_Sparrows", "http://www.goodreads.com/book/show/417807.Beneath_a_Southern_Sky"]}
