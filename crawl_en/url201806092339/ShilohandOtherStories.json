This is not the book for you if you enjoy a dense plot. Be forewarned: nothing really happens. A couple hundred pages later and I can recall a tree being cut down, dinners being made, cats being fed\u2026like most fiction I enjoy or movies I prefer, what I take with me is the feeling, the loneliness, the futility. This book was a hazy, downtrodden, blur of yearning. Dusks on farms and supermarket checkouts and greyhound buses and TV dinners eaten by the blue flickering light and a soft undercurrent of bored housewives waking from a deep slumber.They are beautiful. Sorrowful. Understated. And the endings come suddenly and much too quickly. Like life. Things feel incomplete."}, {"userName": "Jamie", "userReviewDate": "Jun 09, 2013", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/51089-jamie", "userReview": "These were really something.

I can't get over the story's magic, I keep re-reading it to comprehend its hypnotic complexity and simplicity (both) its honesty and intuitive sense of how the world leaves us so connected and so alone. The others in this award winning collection (the collection won the PEN/Hemingway Award) have this quality also, the title story \"Shiloh\" is breathtaking. Jesus, they all are. Some of them are also outrageously funny.It never stops with this writer's work, her novels and stories. BAM's work bubbles with longing, sly humor, a dangerous amount of tenderness, sadness, and everyday wisdom; She does this the way no other writer does, in such an accessible, intuitive, no-nonsense way, using tiny and sometimes random details which stick in ones mind forever...Almost everyone whose writing I respect has something similar to say about Bobbie Ann Mason's work. Mostly, when I bring her work up, good writers say to me \"She is the one who made me want to write, or think I could write.\" BAM creates for the reader a lingering, unforgettable ache for the feeling ones of this world."}, {"userName": "Nathan", "userReviewDate": "Sep 18, 2007", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/287435-nathan", "userReview": "The title story is as good as advertised, but after that I found this collection relentlessly one-note.

I\u2019m glad I read this book. The stories all have similar themes, and if you read it all at once like I did, the characters and plots can get a little confusing and start to run together. The author writes perfectly using the dialect and slang of country people in Kentucky. All the stories take place in western Kentucky, and familiar places like Paducah, Kentucky Lake, and Murray State University are often mentioned. I loved the characters in these stories because, if you are from Kentucky, most likely you have known people who are just like them in the way that they talk and act. All of the stories have a theme of relationships, and the characters all seemed to be yearning for something more out of life, although what was not always clear. There is not a clean ending for most of these stories, but it is just like sampling a slice of their everyday lives. This is a nice book to pick up and read when you are on the go and don\u2019t want to be tied down with a long novel."}, {"userName": "Lynn", "userReviewDate": "Jan 21, 2012", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/7336194-lynn", "userReview": "\"Bobbie Ann Mason is an unusually attractive younger writer whose works have appeared in The New Yorker...\" Isn't it strange that the above is the first sentence of the inside book jacket cover for this book?

I know I enjoyed the second reading more than the first. Ms. Mason captures the voices of my family and friends during my younger years, giving their dreams and wishes a voice I didn't capture or understand the first time around. The stories are all different in location and characters but carry a theme of how our parents and grandparents looked at everyday life and how they managed to survive the sameness of chores and lifestyles that were expected during the 1950s and 1960s. I particularly enjoyed \"The Ocean\" with the couple driving their new RV to see the Atlantic Ocean for the first time. Some lines were very poignant, others made me laugh out loud! Remember those long trips on vacation and parents would pull off the highway and moms would spread peanut butter and jelly on warm bread? Camping at night while moms cooked supper in the RVs or over a campfire? The still-continued ritual in some parts of the south of \"Decoration Day\" or \"Graveyard Day\"? \"Graveyard Day\" was another favorite in this collection. Although this collection was published back in 1982, the stories are from an earlier day and remind us of how much we've changed but, more importantly sometimes, how much we've stayed the same. I enjoyed this little volume and look forward to reading more of Ms. Mason's works. These are \"comfortable\" reads, no gore, no huge thrills, but a relaxing journey about how many of us lived while growing up."}, {"userName": "Tara White", "userReviewDate": "Jan 27, 2018", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/22491671-tara-white", "userReview": "Interesting read.

So much so, I would almost say that Mason became my favorite contemporary writer, although if it came down to recommending a work, I don't really think any of the 3 I've read so far is truly \"great\" on its own. It's the final reflection or cumulative appeal that makes her work important to me...that and the enjoyment of reading it in the present tense!Mason does use present tense segments quite a bit in the SHILOH stories. Normally that style doesn't appeal to me, but here it works as an appropriate mark of her down-home characters' time orientation: the past is quickly ignored (though its deep effects lurk everywhere unsuspected), while the future is only something the here & now grades into unnoticeably. I shared \"Residents and Transients\" and \"The Retreat\" with my husband, in hopes of giving him an impression of my homesick outsider's status while we visited Estonia.Mason's evocation of the small-town American attitude is masterful."}, {"userName": "Dave", "userReviewDate": "Feb 09, 2017", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/1927322-dave", "userReview": "For the first half of the book this was headed toward 1 star.

Then she goes and does something really wild at the end to symbolize her new freedom. I found this collection to be both dated and disappointing as a whole, for being a whole lot of the same thing.

Story topics deal with family relationships, and many touch upon the changes feminism brought to households and, particularly, husband-wife relationships. Most of the characters are working-class who deal with problems faced by people of all economic groups. I especially like the title story, \"Shiloh,\" which tackles the changes that occur when a male breadwinner becomes jobless and his wife becomes the financial head of household. The shift in roles becomes seismic in this story. \"Offerings\" is another favorite of mine, which explores dynamics among generations of women in the same family.

She's a solid writer. She's really great at creating a sense of place--she's definitely a southern writer. Most of her characters work at places like K-Mart and the Piggly Wiggly, and many frown upon cursing and drinking. And few are happy--but then, what characters in short stories are happy? Who wants to read stories about those people?Reading the stories was like reading a novel; the characters and situations all flowed together, so it seemed like you were reading about people you know.

I'm actually somewhat obsessed with the idea that an author can be so economical with words, yet often create a lasting impression/feeling that lingers. Bobbie Ann Mason, with her strong Southern influence, has some stories that can do this. Most of her work is downright depressing, yet the characters stay with you. Most of the stories don't resolve neatly, if at all. I like this for the feeling it gives of being present for a quick moment in the lives of others. However, her stories often tend to run together in my mind as do the characters.
