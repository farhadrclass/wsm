However, I like to think that I was wise beyond my years and knew a phony, self-congratulatory, pretentious buffoon when I saw one. On the other hand, I did wear baggy overalls with Birkenstocks every day back then and wondered why I didn\u2019t have a boyfriend, so clearly I didn\u2019t know everything.But as I read through the reviews here, I am confronted by a rush of unpleasant memories about this particular reading experience. The narrator did indeed seem like a dick. And he may have been okay with that, because I got the impression that he\u2019s one of those guys who doesn\u2019t care if he comes off as a dick, because his purpose in life is to Figure It All Out, and disseminate his impressive knowledge to the masses of sheep-like mouth-breathers who wandered into Waldenbooks and picked up a mass-market paperback copy of his masterpiece. Their lives will be changed! The narrator is too busy unraveling the mysteries of the universe to bother with being likable. It\u2019s a sacrifice, but someone has to do it. We should be thanking him!And this is just an aside, but part of me always wonders if there is something wrong with me, or if I\u2019m an elitist or delusional because I\u2019ve never read a \u201clife-changing\u201d book. That\u2019s right: a book has never changed me. I read as a kind of re-affirmation of what I think I already know, somewhere deep down. Or I simply read to experience the pleasure of a good story. I\u2019ve put a book down and thought to myself, \u201cBoy, that was a good book. I\u2019m in such a pleasant/ponderous/gloomy mood now. Well done!\u201d But never have I put down a book and thought, \u201cBefore I read this, I was wandering around on this thing we call Earth with the wrong ideas about life/people/religion/mechanical engineering, but now I have been enlightened. From this point forward, my life will be different. I will be a better person.\u201d I don\u2019t know. Maybe I just have a bad attitude, or think that I\u2019m smarter than everyone else. Maybe I\u2019m no better than our friend Mr. Pirsig. If you think that may be the case, I suppose you can just ignore this review completely and read Zen and the Art of Motorcycle Maintenance.But! If you think I\u2019m just like Pirsig, you would want to heed my advice about this book and avoid it, wouldn\u2019t you? Aha! You see, you can\u2019t like us both, otherwise the universe will implode. Or will it? Perhaps it is no more than a conundrum I have devised out of sheer malice and a masturbatory sense of self-importance. Perhaps I am full of shit. You\u2019ll never know for sure. You can\u2019t escape this philosophy-ninja\u2019s intellectual trap. Don\u2019t even try."}, {"userName": "Clinton", "userReviewDate": "Jun 22, 2007", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/146986-clinton", "userReview": "I feel like Robert M.

So I said to my brain, 'there's no need to be so rude,' and my brain said, 'no seriously, I can't handle this anymore, really, let me take a break'. So it did and I've been operating on brain-stem alone ever since. I don't know it's made that much difference.I wonder if the author's brain was thinking like mine was? Certainly when I was reading this book and sort of enjoying it (2 stars-worth), I was also thinking I am just too old to be reading this sort of cod-philosophy, too old and not stoned enough. I read other people's reviews and have to conclude that they all saw something in this book that impressed them as deep and me as deeply populist. Either way, I didn't really enjoy it and it only gets two stars because the writing was ok, the book wasn't arduous to read, some parts of it were interesting and enjoyable.I wasn't that keen on the author's exploration of his mental breakdown either. I find when other people tell me the dreams they had last night, or I have to read them in a book I turn off as well. I really don't know why, nor do I know if others also feel this way. When telling last night's major really interesting dream to someone else, I've never said, \"Do you find this as boring as I would if it was you telling me?\" Actually that's a load of guff, I don't tell other people my dreams because I suspect they would be bored rigid and neither do I tell them about my mental breakdown when I saw three rainbows in the sky and didn't kill myself because I couldn't find a nightie that was suitable. See, boring!I kept thinking that Roberts (the author of Shantaram) and Pirsig would get on really well. They could sit in cafes in foreign parts swapping tales of derring-do, drugs and their fascinating insights whilst waiting for an audience to join them. That's a bit mean-spirited as Pirsig is a great deal more appealing as an author and person than the somewhat sleazy Roberts, but I think you get what I mean. And I will say that it's quite readable, the travel descriptions are very well done, the characters, apart from the hero, are in general interesting but... I still couldn't get into it.Anyway, it's a Sunday, much love and an extra star!"}, {"userName": "Richard", "userReviewDate": "Jul 31, 2007", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/235151-richard", "userReview": "There are three threads weaving through this book (none of which, as is pointed out, has much to do with either eastern philosophy or with motorcycle maintenance.)The first is a straightforward narration by a man riding across the country with his young son and two friends (a married couple). This evocative travelogue is by far the most enjoyable aspect of the novel.The second element is a sort of mystery as that man struggles with his memory; it's gradually revealed that he's on the road both to escape his past and to attempt to remember it.The last thread is where the book just falls apart. Through the narrator's dialogue with himself, Pirsig puts forward his ludicrous \"philosophy of quality,\" which essentially holds that \"quality,\" whatever that might be, is somehow the fundamental reality of the universe. If that sounds like nonsense then you understand it perfectly.When we find out why the narrator had lost his memory in the first place, the answers don't live up to any expectations we might have been unfortunate enough to have developed."}, {"userName": "Katherine", "userReviewDate": "May 23, 2007", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/95574-katherine", "userReview": "After years of people saying, \"Oh, you're a philosophy major? Have you heard of Zen and the Art of Motorcycle Maintenance? You should read it!\" I finally broke down and bought a copy. I am usually wary of books that seem to hold promises of sweetness and light and spiritual awakening, in this age of The Purpose-Driven Life and Silver Ravenwolf.My thoughts on the book, even months after reading it, are still mixed. Artistically, I do think it's a polished and respectable piece of literature. It's well-written and compelling. But my philosophy major side is hesitant about it. I don't know much about Zen Buddhism, so I can't speak for how Pirsig treated that aspect, but the rundowns on philosophy made me anxious in the way that \"Philosophy for Dummies\" makes me anxious: you have to assume that the author's interpretation is one that is valid. And sometimes there was enough value judgment language that it felt like the text was \"conveniently\" interpreting the philosopher at hand, as opposed to fairly.It's a good book, and I recommend it, but I also recommend reading more about the philosophies Pirsig touches on, eg Kant, Hume, Aristotle, Socrates, Plato, etc. Anything that turns people on to philosophy can't be all bad, after all."}, {"userName": "Riku Sayuj", "userReviewDate": "Aug 31, 2011", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/1651956-riku-sayuj", "userReview": "Plato's Phaedrus said, \"And what is written well and what is written badly...need we ask Lysias or any other poet or orator who ever wrote or will write either a political or other work, in meter or out of meter, poet or prose writer, to teach us this?\"Modern Phaedrus said, \u201cAnd what is good, Phaedrus, And what is not good\u2014 Need we ask anyone to tell us these things?\u201d I keep re-reading passages from Zen and the Art and Tao of Pooh and Siddhartha and try to make sense in the context of everyday life (which is where I firmly believe any philosophical questions need to be answered - If it is not applicable in your kitchen, it is not real philosophy) and quite strangely the answers seem to come from tying in the learning from these metaphysical and spiritual works with a book like The Story of Stuff - neither a great book nor a literary achievement or a leap in thinking - but it helped me understand the real meaning of the word 'materialism' when I read it in parallel with these other books.

Although it is deep and complicated and takes a lot of focus to read, I feel that there are a lot of great messages here in the author\u2019s search for Quality. This was my second time reading this book, and I liked it more this time.\tInterlaced with stories from an across-the-west motorcycle trip with his son and some friends, Pirsig tells the story of his past in an almost former life before being admitted to a mental institution after going crazy in his pursuit of Quality. He often uses the motorcycle as an analogy, as well as climbing mountains. With what many would see as too much depth and detail (but not me), he dissects the ideas of rhetoric, quality, the scientific method, technology and many ideas of the ancient Greek philosophers and tries to take down an entire academic department in the search of a unifying truth/god/connecting force. I don\u2019t really feel that there is a lot that I can say to do this book justice in a short review form like this. I\u2019ll just write up a bunch of underlined quotes instead.\u201c\u2026physical discomfort is important only when the mood is wrong. Then you fasten on to whatever thing is uncomfortable and call that the cause. But if the mood is right, then physical discomfort doesn\u2019t mean much.\u201d\u201cCaring about what you are doing is considered either unimportant or taken for granted.\u201d\u201cThat\u2019s the first normal thing I\u2019ve said in weeks. The rest of the time I\u2019m feigning twentieth-century lunacy just like you are. So as to not draw attention to myself.\u201d\u201cNobody is concerned anymore about tidily conserving space. The land isn\u2019t valuable anymore. We are in a Western town.\u201d\u201cBut to tear down a factory or to revolt against a government or to avoid repair of a motorcycle because it is a system is to attack effects rather than causes; and as long as the attack is upon effects only, no change is possible. The true system, the real system, is our present construction of systematic thought itself, rationality itself, and if a factory is torn down but the rationality which produced it is left standing, then that rationality will simply produce another factory. If a revolution destroys a systematic government , but the systematic patterns of thought that produced that government are left intact, then those patterns will repeat themselves in the succeeding government. There\u2019s so much talk about the system. And so little understanding.\u201d\u201cIf the purpose of scientific method is to select from among a multitude of hypotheses, and if the number of hypotheses grows faster than experimental method can handle, then it is clear that all hypotheses can never be tested. If all hypotheses cannot be tested, then the results of any experiment are inconclusive and the entire scientific method falls short of its goal of establishing proven knowledge.\u201d\u201cSometimes it\u2019s a little better to travel than to arrive.\u201d\u201cYou look at where you\u2019re going and where you are and it never makes sense, but then you look back at where you\u2019ve been and a pattern seems to emerge. And if you project forward from that pattern, then sometimes you can come up with something.\u201d\u201cBut what\u2019s happening is that each year our old flat earth of conventional reason becomes less and less adequate to handle the experiences we have and this is creating widespread feelings of topsy-turviness. As a result we\u2019re getting more and more people in irrational areas of thought \u2013 occultism, mysticism, drug changes and the like \u2013 because they feel the inadequacy of classical reason to handle what they know are real experiences.\u201d\u201cThe trouble is that essays always have to sound like God talking for eternity, and that isn\u2019t the way it ever is. People should see that it\u2019s never anything other than just one person talking from one place in time and space and circumstance. It\u2019s never been anything else, ever, but you can\u2019t get that across in an essay.\u201d\u201cThe allegory of a physical mountain for the spiritual one that stands between each soul and its goal is an easy and natural one to make. Like those in the valley behind us, most people stand in sight of the spiritual mountains all their lives and never enter them, being content to listen to others who have been there and thus avoid the hardships. Some travel into the mountains accompanied by experienced guides who know the best and least dangerous routes by which they arrive at their destination. Still others, inexperienced and untrusting, attempt to make their own routes. Few of these are successful, but occasionally some, by sheer will and luck and grace, do make it. Once there they become more aware than any of the others that there\u2019s no single or fixed number of routes. There are as many routes as there are individual souls.\u201d\u201cHe was just stopped. Waiting. For that missing seed crystal of thought that would suddenly solidify everything.\u201d\u201cAny effort that has self-glorification as its final endpoint is bound to end in disaster\u2026 When you try to climb a mountain to prove how big you are, you almost never make it. And even if you do it\u2019s a hollow victory. In order to sustain the victory you have to prove yourself again and again in some other way, and again and again and again, driven forever to fill a false image, haunted by the fear that the image is not true and someone will find out. That\u2019s never the way.\u201d\u201cThe holiness of the mountain infused into their own spirits enabled them to endure far more than anything he, with his greater physical strength, could take.\u201d \u201cCare and Quality are internal and external aspects of the same thing. A person who sees Quality and feels it as he works is a person who cares. A person who cares about what he sees and does is a person who\u2019s bound to have some characteristic of quality.\u201d\u201cThey have patience, care and attentiveness to what they\u2019re doing, but more than this \u2013 there\u2019s a kind of inner peace of mind that isn\u2019t contrived but results from a kind of harmony with the work in which there\u2019s no leader and no follower. The material and the craftsman\u2019s thoughts change together in a progression of smooth, even changes until his mind is at rest at the exact instant the material is right.\u201d\u201cOr if he takes whatever dull job he\u2019s stuck with \u2013 and they are all, sooner or later, dull \u2013 and, just to keep himself amused, starts to look for options of Quality, and secretly pursues these options, just for their own sake, thus making an art out of what he is doing, he\u2019s likely to discover he becomes a much more interesting person and much less of an object to the people around him because his Quality decisions change him too. And not only the job and him, but others, too, because the Quality tends to fan out like waves. The Quality job he didn\u2019t think anyone was going to see is seen, and the person who sees it feels a little better because of it and is likely to pass that feeling on to others, and in that way the Quality tends to keep on going.My personal feeling is that this is how any further improvement of the world will be done: by individuals making Quality decisions and that\u2019s all.God, I don\u2019t want to have any more enthusiasm for big programs full of social planning for big masses of people that leave individual Quality out. These can be left alone for a while. There\u2019s a place for them but they\u2019ve got to be built on a foundation of Quality within the individuals involved. We\u2019ve had that individual quality in the past, exploited as a natural resource without knowing it, and now it\u2019s just about depleted. Everyone\u2019s just about out if gumption. And I think it\u2019s about time to return the rebuilding of this American resource \u2013 individual worth. There are political reactionaries who\u2019ve been saying something close to this for years. I\u2019m not one of them, but to the extent they\u2019re talking about real individual worth and not just an excuse for giving more money to the rich, they\u2019re right. We do need a return to individual integrity, self-reliance and old-fashioned gumption. We really do.\u201d\u201cWhat is good, Phaedrus, and what is not good \u2013 need we ask anyone to tell us these things?\u201d"}, {"userName": "Charlotte", "userReviewDate": "Sep 13, 2007", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/327206-charlotte", "userReview": "OK, maybe I'm being a little too harsh. I actually enjoyed the idea of the cross-country motorcycle ride, the details about motorcycle mechanics, and especially the portrayal of the narrator's relationship with his son. The son was the best part of the whole book. Unfortunately, there wasn't much space for sonny, because dad was too busy advertising the author's brilliant philisophical insights. Even more unfortunately, the insights weren't brilliant, and consumed hundreds of tedious pages. It occured to me to wonder whether the author was trying to make the point that the narrator was a pompous idiot; however, the intent seemed to be for the reader to be blown away by the brilliance of the narrator's philosophical insights, and hence by the brilliance of the author who conceived of the narrator and the philosophical insights. I can't believe I made it through 380 pages of this."}, {"userName": "William1", "userReviewDate": "Nov 17, 2017", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/4684009-william1", "userReview": "Brilliant! Pirsig might be something of an American Montaigne, producing readable philosophy with a minimum of abtractions. That\u2019s a gift. After undergoing electro-convulsive therapy 28 times, Pirsig, in this book, gives his formerly insane self a doppelg\u00e4nger-like alter-ego, Phaedrus, and bravely tries to piece together that formerly insane self\u2019s thought in order to learn from it. This alone is fascinating. At the same time Pirsig is reviewing aspects of eastern and western philosophical thought. If you are a philosophy major, however, maybe this book\u2019s not for you. For me, however, the book's essential. I need books that make philosophy comprehensible. All too often I find the great geniuses incoherent amid their heaped abstractions. Another recent philosophy-decrypting book I found helpful was Sarah Bakewell\u2019s At the Existentialist Caf\u00e9: Freedom, Being, and Apricot Cocktails, in which the author lays bare the foundations of phenomenology and existentialism. Another was Walter Kaufman\u2019s Nietsche: Philosopher Psychologist Antichrist. But while those books are, in the first case, explications of two related schools of philosophy, and in the second, of a particular philosopher\u2019s thought and how it was abused by fascists, Zen and the Art of Motorcycle Maintenance is a forensic reconstruction of a philosophy which sent its author to the nut house.In that respect alone, the book represents an astonishing act of bravery in the face of unimaginable suffering. Quality is explained as part of a trinity not equivalent to mind and matter, but anterior to it. Quality is the proto-reality that exists before our minds can hitch analogues to sensed perceptions. I didn\u2019t quite understand it at first either. Probably because these were the arguments that led Phaedrus to 28 electro-convulsive therapies and a long hospitalization. He \u201c...felt something let go\u201d and was overwhelmed with a \u201cwhole new flood of philosophical associations.\u201d He pulls out his copy of the Tao Te Ching and there it is, his idea of Quality, as revealed by the mystic Lao Tzu 2,400 years ago. Insanity.But then slowly, under the patient questioning of the recovered post-treatment Pirsig, the argument begins to coalesce. We are then introduced to Jules Henri Poincar\u00e9 and learn of the crisis in the exact sciences of his day. Poincar\u00e9 goes on to discover the subjectivity of systems, his point of departure being Euclid\u2019s troublesome Fifth Postulate. Poincar\u00e9 determines that it is facts which are infinite and it is up to the human mind to select subliminal factual harmonies\u2014the mathematicians\u2019s beautiful proof, for example\u2014which rises to consciousness seemingly unbidden in the form of eureka moments. Thereby, says Poincar\u00e9, are systems devised and they are legion. In coming to this conclusion, it turns out, Poincar\u00e9 long ago built a back channel to the idea of Quality Phaedrus would develop.The difference between a good mechanic and a bad mechanic, like the difference between a good mathematician and a bad one, is precisely this ability to select the good facts from the bad ones on the basis of quality. He has to care! This is an ability about which formal traditional scientific method has nothing to say. It\u2019s long past time to take a closer look at this qualitative preselection of facts which has seemed so scrupulously ignored by those who make so much of these facts after they are \u201cobserved.\u201d I think that it will be found that a formal acknowledgment of the role of Quality in the scientific process doesn\u2019t destroy the empirical vision at all. It expands it, strengthens it and brings it far closer to actual scientific practice. (p.288)I have neglected to mention the alternative narrative with which all this woolgathering is contrasted\u2014Moby-Dick-style\u2014and that is the cross country motorcycle trip the author takes through Montana and Idaho and Oregon and California with his son, Chris. That storyline ties in with the philosophy in a subtle mutually supporting way that\u2019s a joy to read. I enjoyed the attack on Aristotle, whom I\u2019ve always found unreadable. But how Pirsig can make sitting through doctoral seminars so riveting is something to be pondered. It helps, I suppose, if one's teachers are complete assholes, as they are here. The haymaker Phaedrus delivers to the glass jaw of the Great Books curriculum at the University of Chicago is enormous fun to read about. Phaedrus attends a course on rhetoric there that is\u2014by Pirsig's later definition\u2014insane. Pirsig claims that everything not on the metaphorical train of Quality is by definition insanity. That\u2019s why he can\u2019t leave the train, no one can. I look forward to reading this one again. A Great Book in itself perhaps.

Pirsig, Zen and the Art of Motorcycle Maintenance: \"I can see by my watch, without taking my hand from the left grip of the cycle, that it is eight-thirty in the morning.\"I have read Zen probably four or five times. The clinical precision of the author is apparent in all the detail here (\"left grip\", \"eight-thirty\"). The self-reference of the author looking at his own watch will become a leitmotif as the entire book is about the author looking deep into his own soul (so deep in fact that the real author became temporarily insane between finishing Zen and starting the sequel Lila.) The author is definitely a morning kind of a guy, already rolling down the highway early in the morning. The fact that he looks without taking his hand of the grip, gives us a very cinematic presentation of this otherwise banal scene. Also, the mundane nature of riding a motorcycle and looking at a watch and finding the even important enough to write about centers us on the cycle itself and foreshadows the many allusions and allegories that will come between philosophy and cycling.lZen for me remains a go to book for solace and reflection.

I'd studied quite a lot of philosophy since I read it a year and a half ago and so the philosophies didn't go over my head this time.First, I must say if you find the narrator off-putting, rest assured that the protagonist is NOT the narrator. The narrator is the nemesis who has eclipsed the protagonist; the story reveals their struggle. The introduction of my edition hints at this, but apparently some people haven't gotten that as I've read comments of several people complaining about the narrator. Robert Pirsig\u2019s genius in Zen and the Art of Motorcycle Maintenance is to insert classical forms of thought into the backdrop of a cross-country motorcycle trip. He piques our interest by waxing philosophical in an effort to get to the root of the ghost story haunting him. He succeeds in creating the quintessential philosophy book of the 20th Century. It turns out that the motorcycle is a symbol of the soul.A brief summary of Pirsig\u2019s \u201cchautauquas\u201d follows, but bear in mind that this list is informational, whereas his book is spirited and transformational. (Chautauqua means \u201ctalks intended to edify and entertain, improve the mind and bring culture and enlightenment to the ears and thoughts of the hearer.\u201d p. 15)There are two ways of experiencing a motorcycle:1.\tRomantically\u2014riding a cycle down a mountain road, invigorated by the wind rushing past2.\tClassically\u2014familiarizing yourself with the working parts of the machine, developing a feel for how tight to secure the bolts.Romantic experience is \u201cin the moment.\u201d Classical experience connects the past to the future, allowing us to build on previous knowledge:1.\tSystems of Components and Functions\u2014physical working parts which we come to know either:a.\tEmpirically\u2014knowledge gained by the sensesb.\ta priori\u2014knowledge gained intuitively (known without prior experience)2.\tConcepts\u2014Ideas with the potential to be realized (the thought precedes the creation of the physical object).a.\tInductive ideas start with observing specific examples and end with a general conclusion.b.\tDeductive ideas start with general knowledge used to predict specific observations.Connecting the Romantic to the Classical is Quality. To care about something will increase its quality.Pirsig creates an analogy comparing knowledge to a railroad train that is always going somewhere:\u2022\tClassic Knowledge is the engine and the cars.\u2022\tRomantic reality adds the dimension of time\u2014it is the cutting edge of the experience, the moment in time. \u2022\tTraditional knowledge is the body of classic knowledge plus the history of where the train has been.\u2022\tQuality is the track\u2014the \u201cpreintellectual reality\u201d or \u201cthe moment of vision before the intellectualization takes place\u201d (p. 247). What carries the train forward is a sense of what is good. It is understood intuitively and enhanced by skill and experience. \u2022\tIf your train gets stuck, understand two things:o\tBeing stuck eventually produces real understanding as you look for the solution in your train of knowledge. (A classical experience)o\tDon\u2019t be afraid to stop and analyze\u2014you can see in patterns not only the physical object but the idea or function of the object.

It's a treatise on metaphysics as well as a compelling story which the author says is autobiographical. It's exactly right about the scientific method, and the way we go about discovering truth as a society and as individuals. The analogy of working on motorcycles is a good one. In my life it's been programming computers and figuring out how to get industrial machinery to work, but the same process works for all of the above. The thing I find most excellent in this book is that it points out the step where the mystery comes in, i.e. coming up with new hypotheses, the long sought \"aha\" that comes when you're working on a hard problem. Science has no method for how you get that. You just play with the problem, turn it over in your mind, try things, strive to understand, and then  the answer sometimes appears in your head. It's a complete mystery. There are stories in the history of science, about Kekule who figured out the ring structure of Benzene from a dream about a snake swallowing its tail, about Einstein at age 13 picturing what it would be like to ride the crest of a light wave, and on and on. This book showed me that buried in the heart of science is something generative and alive that defies scientific explanation, simply because it's outside the system.\"The truth knocks on your door, and you say 'Go away! I'm looking for the truth!' so it goes away.\" That's such an exact description of how our preconceived ideas often keep us from finding the truth. (The truth in this context is completely knowable once we've found it. I mean if the motorcycle runs afterwards, then we've solved the problem. That's why I love applied science and engineering.) The other great idea that I use all the time from this book is that the very cutting edge, the place where the tire tread hits the pavement, is always messy and confusing and just a place of floundering around in uncertainty. He makes the analogy of a train, with all the cars full of facts that we know, and the engine, where new track is being laid, is not contained in any of the cars. It's always murky up there, and never neat and well-defined. So that unpleasant feeling of uncertainty, of confusion, of floundering around, it's the VERY THING that we should cultivate in order to discover the truth. I tell myself that when I'm in that situation, that I should revel in this feeling instead of dreading it. (And, in fact, I mostly get paid because I can stick through that feeling to the payoff, the \"aha\" part. The most important thing I learned in college is that something utterly confusing and befuddling can come clear if I will invest the effort to play around with it and figure it out. So I get to do that all the time now. =))What I have found in the years of figuring out why programs or machines don't work, and fixing them, is that really very little in life and the universe is well-understood. We have this large mental construct of scientific understanding, and it's indeed impressive. We can cure typhoid now and build bridges that stay up (conscious irony). But even in the areas that we would like to think are very well known, and neat and clear, there is so much that isn't understood. Otherwise, why would these questions come up continually? Why doesn't this program work? Why is my pulper feed system not working the way we expected? Why did my motorcycle engine run so badly in the mountains? What made this bridge suddenly collapse during rush hour?This book explores all of those ideas and sheds a lot of light on them. I understand the universe far better because of having read this book. That's why I gave it 5 stars, a rating I reserve for books that changed who I am or how I see the world."}, {"userName": "Guillermo  ", "userReviewDate": "Jul 09, 2013", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/11481458-guillermo", "userReview": "Fuck!

My goal was 50 books this year, and Im 8 books behind. I will count this book as read no matter what you say. You know when you start a roadtrip and everything is awesome and a breath of fresh air in the beginning, but then you're at each other's throats towards the middle? That's what this book was. It started off slow and boring. Like a lazy canoe trip through the Everglades. It was a nice change of pace from the bombastic stuff I was reading, but then you bash into a wall. The boring stuff is interlaced with more boring stuff. I know I sound like a monkey now. I know I sound uneducated as shit, but those philosophy lessons embedded into the narrative were soo boring. The book is a great example of the archethypical \"journey story\" that turns sucky. At first, you're jiving with everything, you get into some cool conversations, but after a few days, ... everyone stinks. Everyone is tired and have bags under their eyes. The vaginas smell like old tuna and the penises smell like rotting bacon (I made that up I never smelled crusty penis). Everything sucks. Thats what this booj turned into. Plus, the author is a douchebag. He's boring me. I'm supposed to believe he was formerly known as Phaedrus, and he thought himself into insanity on the quest of finding out the meaning of quality and rationality? Im not exaggerating that. Early in the book he describes how he got electro fucking shock therapy for this. Really!! You fucking drove yourself literally insane thinking about that??? You really thought yourself into that black a hole? Fucking get a life! Who does that? At that moment, my credibility for the author (who is thinly veiled as the protagonist in this stupid story) flew out the window. You have a kid dude!! Get it together. It doesn't help that he's such an asshole to that kid. All in the name of making him grow up to be a great man. Really? Fucking feed that kid, and dont make him climb a stupid mountain because of your own ridiculous ambition. Maybe this book does a 180 degree turn in the final half and becomes really evocative AND entertaining, but I just dont care anymore. I hate giving books this low a rating.

After years of putting this one off, I finally recently read it and was floored by how it was almost nothing like what I expected: motorcycle talk and philosophy. I did not expect the contemplations of a depressing, crazy person. But that's no reason to hate on a book, and I don't hate Zen..., I'm just not in love with it. I was close to giving it only 3 stars mainly for its inability to move. I mean, for a roadtrip book it certainly seems to languish in the doldrums far too often. I gave it the extra star because I have a soft spot for philosophy in the form of rational evaluations and minute dissections of the mind, which this has in spades. The writing itself is good. In fact at times I thought I was reading very well-written fictional characters. The author's son's whiney desperation irritated, but for the right reasons, because it felt so real. My recommendation is to read this if you like philosophical contemplations, but don't read it if you're only interested in the motorcycle aspect."}, {"userName": "Daniel Bastian", "userReviewDate": "Dec 05, 2014", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/5702158-daniel-bastian", "userReview": "I'm convinced this is one of those books that somehow made it onto the high school syllabus and just sort of stuck around, with no one ever examining its right to be there. This then created the unwarranted impression that Pirsig's text is a 'classic' or something approaching significance. I say this with only slight reservation, but I don't think there is any kind of genius, misunderstood or otherwise, to be found in this bloviated acid trip. Pirsig warns in the author's note not to expect an accurate commentary on Zen Buddhism or motorcycle maintenance. What he neglects to mention is that you won't learn much of anything else, either.With a title like Zen and the Art of Motorcycle Maintenance: An Inquiry Into Values, I suppose I shouldn't have been too surprised when I wound up with a soupy slog through a tortuous jungle smeared over with the purest bird guano. Which is to say the book revels in being tedious, in laying out tedium on an operating table and dissecting it into its little tedious parts. By itself this isn't a dealbreaker, but if what's being conveyed tediously (in this case the intricacies of motorcycle anatomy as a launching pad for the unification of Occident-Orient philosophies) isn't worth the intellectual expenditure, something has gone wrong. And with this one, something went very, very wrong.The semi-autobiographical book sets out under cover of a novel\u2014a cross-country father-and-son bike trip\u2014before quickly devolving into an effluvium of Pirsig's disordered thoughts. I seriously doubt any foresight went into this novel; thoughts are scattered so vagrantly across the pages that you increasingly expect the all-pervading synthesis that must surely await you at the end. Expect to be disappointed. Not even Pirsig, apparently, could clean this mess up into a functional philosophical treatise. It's as if a stream of thoughts came to him in the shower and, not sure what to make of them, jotted them down in slapdash fashion, hoping someone would come along later and piece it all together into an integrative, paradigm-shifting, status quo-shattering whole. I, for one, don't wish to be that person.What you should expect instead are prolonged servings of motorcycle-speak and mechanic lingo and quasi-intellectual discussion of the term 'Quality'\u2014what it is, what it isn't, what it means, how it works, why it matters. Most of his \"Chautauquas\", as he calls them, begin with, \"Now I want to discuss...\", such as: \"I want to talk now about Phaedrus' exploration into the meaning of the term Quality, an exploration of which he saw as a route through the mountains of the spirit.\" (p. 168). The mystical undertones irked me here and there, but not as much as his bait-and-switch of pretending to tell a story that is really just an open-ended, self-indulgent, coma-inducing lecture.I should say at this point that I am a huge fan of philosophy. Much of philosophy is interesting, intangibly so, and indispensable to every conscious adult. (You can't have science without philosophy, for example.) Some of it can even be life-changing and revelatory. But you wouldn't know it if this book is your first and only data point on the discipline. It's books like this which give philosophy a bad name and turn people away from the subject. Anyone looking to get their feet wet is better off reading Kant, Camus, Sartre, Nietzche, Hume, Buber, Locke, Hobbes, Rousseau, Marcus Aurelius, Dogen, Mencius, Spinoza, De Chardin or Thomas Merton, or digging around for Plato and Aristotle online.Worse, it's not even well-written. I cannot recall a single lyrically memorable passage in the entire book. The dialogue sections, apart from being wooden, stodgy and vacant of life, are completely disposable as mere segues cutting up the oration. And the way Pirsig uses the stuffy, hidebound university professor to validate his supposedly earth-shaking ideas is childishly bogus. Perhaps Pirsig has an axe to grind, or perhaps his opinion of himself is higher than it should be.Closing ThoughtsIn the afterword to the 10th anniversary edition, Pirsig reveals that his book was turned down by 121 different publishing houses (a record according to Guinness). I'm not saying this shouldn't have been published, but I am saying I understand why it almost wasn't. Pirsig aspired to pierce the boundaries of philosophy itself, to unify the dualism blanketing modern academia. Instead of achieving this quixotic but admirable target, he ends up mostly with disjointed, turgid ramblings that veer occasionally into the territories of pseudoscience and New Agey-mysticism. The novelistic tropes sprinkled in are there simply to make his quasi-arcane discourses more palatable to the reading public.It's my opinion that ZAMM is well-known among pseudo-intellectuals who pretend to have discovered something profound in it. But we must be honest in recognizing that not all philosophy is profound. Some of it is deeply insightful and life-affirming, while some portion of it is poofy and, yes, low on quality. Period piece or not, this is just bad philosophy.Post-ScriptAs an addendum to this review after reading other reactions and takeaways, it does seem that one\u2019s impression of this book is shaped largely by the time of your life that you read it. Art is by its very nature subjective, and I think this rings especially true in the case of ZAMM. A person whose life is in disarray and looking for order may be put off by the scattered thoughts expressed here, while a different person may have the opposite experience and find Pirsig\u2019s chaotic effusions cathartic.I\u2019m aware that many consider ZAMM an insightful novel and even profound intellectual entertainment. Some have gone as far as dubbing it a well-crafted piece of fiction. I do not share these sentiments, but I respect them.The narrator (father) seemed like a \u2018reflective\u2019 man, attempting to sort out his personal and professional struggle and trying to understand the nature of \u2018quality\u2019 and how it can be captured, described or illuminated. Some readers found this struggle fascinating and thought-provoking. I personally found it poorly communicated, not just on a conceptual level but on a literary level as well.The use of \u2018motorcycle\u2019 is supposed to be the analogy of the romantic (form) and the classical (function). According to the narrator, there are two ways of experiencing a motorcycle: romantically and classically. The romantic experience of a motorcycle involves riding it down a mountain road, going past a soft meadow or prairie, and being completely absorbed by the wind rushing past.The classical or functional experience of a motorcycle is to understand the inner mechanism of the machine\u2014how the various different mechanical parts work together in harmony, how to tighten a bolt or fix any maintenance problems. Being romantic is to experience living in the present state, whereas being rational or classical is to connect the past to the future and thus continue to accumulate the collective wisdom and knowledge down through the generations.Through this analogy we are supposed to appreciate both the emotional and logical modes of our life experience, and obtain a sense of how the two interact and reinforce one another. Indeed, the narrator\u2019s romantic experience of his motorcycle was not merely informed but enlarged and uplifted by his classical knowledge of it. That true enlightenment comes from an organic melding of the two flavors is a notion I can certainly understand has broad appeal. However, I think there have been far better treatments of this concept (Sophie\u2019s World comes to mind, a book that maintained a genuine sense of curiosity throughout but avoided making any grandiose claims). Most unfortunate from where I stand, though, is that I found ZAMM a particularly unpleasing, banal and unimpressive read.Note: This review is republished from my official website."}, {"userName": "Trevor", "userReviewDate": "Jun 27, 2007", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/157748-trevor", "userReview": "I started reading this book because i'd heard from a number of people, including comedian Tim Allen, that it was good. In fact i read an entire Tim Allen book (\"I'm Not Really Here\") which was kind of about his experience reading Zen and the Art of Motorcycle Maintainence. Tim Allen, although not exactly a respectable philosopher (maybe not even just respectable), had some of Robert Pirsig's philosophy without all his inane bullshit. At least Tim Allen's book was funny.Admittedly, i enjoyed the book in the beginning. I could tell that the plot was going nowhere specific, but i like books like that. In fact i wrote one. But as i pressed on, page after page, chapter after chapter, i became first bored with it, then irritated. There are essentially three parts to this book, all of which are intertwined at irregular intervals:1. The philosophy stuff. I really like this aspect of the book; all the time he spends talking about Phaedrus and Phaedrus's experiences was mostly fascinating to me. Phaedrus is the real star of the story and the only character i really liked.2. The motorcycle maintainence stuff. Despite the fact that i had no idea what most of it meant, it's factual and to the point, and somehow intersted me just by the way it was written. At some point i even thought about buying a motorcycle, just from inspiration by this book.3. The main story. It's a story about the narrator (Pirsig himself) and his son, Chris, on a motorcycle journey across the country with some friends. Chris is 11 or 12 and mostly just annoying, but the interactions between Pirsig and his son just make me think that Pirsig is a bad father. He always seems angry at Chris for no particular reason and Chris seems to cry a lot due to it. I wonder what Chris thought when he read this book. And it's no wonder to me that the guy's wife left him shortly after it was published (Wikipedia: [http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Robert_P...]).The main thing that i think the book suffers from is the way he abruptly switches between the topics. I've no problem with a rapidly shifting story, if the transitions work. Here, Pirsig would get me going enthusiastically through a Phaedrus segment, and right at the climax...dump me back into him and Chris doing something boring. Then we'd trudge along through that for a while, and suddenly he'd see something that reminded him of Phaedrus, and we'd come to another Phaedrus segment which was not a continuation of the previous.I gave up on the book shortly after the halfway point where Phaedrus began repeating everything over and over and going absolutely nowhere. Sure, i'd like to see what ultimately got him committed to an asylum, but i don't feel like reading any more of this repetitive and bland crap to get there. Ok, you can't put a definition on \"quality,\" i get it, move on to something else. I feel like what Pirsig is saying to me is, \"I've got a point...but i'll never tell you what it is!\" and i hate being taunted. Especially while reading. If this were a movie, chances are i'd tough it out and wait for it to finish just because i know it'll be done soon. But reading, although often more enjoyable, is more time consuming and nobody can deny that. And after wasting weeks of my life reading Robert Jordan's \"The Shadow Rising,\" i've learned my lesson. Life is too short to waste on crappy books. There's lots of good stuff out there, i'mma go get it."}, {"userName": "Aaron", "userReviewDate": "Oct 06, 2008", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/1494382-aaron", "userReview": "This book is one of those books that I want to rate way higher than 3, but I don't think I'd quite give it a 4. I always have this problem with Netflix too! By reading the random reviews posted about this book, many of them are extremely negative, focusing on the \"arrogance\" of the narrator or his \"absurd\" search for quality. I think if you go into this 400 page novel with the expectation that it will be a light read about a motorcycle trip out West with a couple philosophical insights, you'll probably end up with a similar negative review. However, if you go into this book with an open mind, and are willing to look at the world through the eyes of a man deeply entrenched in philosophical meanderings to the point of insanity then you will be rewarded with a new way to look at things.Pirsig takes an 18-day motorcycle journey that he made with his son in 1968 and turns it into an autobiographical journey not only about this trip, but into his mind. Pirsig spent time in a mental hospital before this trip, and much of this book is the story of his trip entwined with the story of the \"insane\" Pirsig. Along with the story of his mental past, Pirsig attempts to break down many types of philosophy and explain the concept that drove him into the mental hospital. This concept is the concept that Quality is the only true reality. It is a very abstract concept and that's why there is so much mundane philosophical background information endlessly filling up the pages. However, I feel that once I finally conquered this book, I came away with some very powerful messages and unique perspectives about the world we live in and the way we live our lives.

The problem is that it is written by some guy who apparently thinks he is God's gift to philosophy. And if you don't agree with him, well, you're clearly an idiot. This is not a constructive discussion about ideas, this is a presentation of why Pirsig is right, which, because this is a discussion on philosophy, is debatable. (Except, as far as Pirsig is concerned, it isn't.) I actually kind of enjoyed the story about the main character's family, especially his son Chris. The problem is that the story is interrupted by many, many pages of what I only can describe as pretentious psychobabble. I can see how this book would be an enjoyable, ego-inflating journey for someone with the exact same views as Pirsig. How very nice for you.

There is also some history of philosophy, although this is to provide an exposition for Pirsig's arguments, so he cherry-picks the stories and interpretations that he tells. This is fine because it is not meant to be a primer on classical or any other kind of philosophy; I don't really have an extensive philosophy background but the little I did know helped I think.Not that they have anything to do with the book, but I have a couple of stories about it. I figure that most people who have any interest in this type of book are already pretty familiar with it, so I won't say too much about it other than that I couldn't put it down and I wholeheartedly recommend it. While I don't agree with Pirsig's entire viewpoint, most of it rang true and even that which didn't was still an excellent impetus for introspection.I got a copy at a used bookstore (I'm pretty sure it was this one) on a trip up to San Francisco with my girlfriend and a mutual friend. At first I had been browsing, and had found a cool coffee table book on phrenology which the lady at the counter chatted with me for a little bit. Encouraged by the chatting, I asked her if they had a book I had been looking for, The Secret Teaching of All Ages by Manly P. Hall, which is an encyclopedic reference about the occult, masonry, astrology, etc. (although it is reprinted in paperback, the original book had lots of charts, illustrations, etc that would not fit in the smaller paperback format and had to be abridged, so I was looking for the original, which I am told is something of a collector's item in certain circles). At this point, the warmth drains from her face. There is an ominous, beginning-of-a-movie-like silence, and she informs me, \"No. I don't sell that book. I'm a Christian.\" When I ask for further clarification, she says that the book contains \"a secret spell to undo the universe\" and that she didn't want any part in helping anyone undo the universe, so she would not sell the book even if she had it. Well, things got kind of awkward at this point, and while trying to avoid eye contact with her, I saw a copy of Zen and the Art of Motorcycle Maintenance in a stack of books waiting to be shelved, and tried to help myself. My friend Ian H had told me it was really good and I figured I'd check it out. She swatted my hand away and sent someone to get me a copy off the shelf. She told me that it was by far the most popular title that they sold.I didn't get around to reading the book until almost a year later, when me and Vinny were on our rail trip to and through Hokkaido. The book got really water damaged during our ill-fated hike up and down Rishi-fuji-zan right around when I was reading Pirsig's mountain climbing allegory. A lot of the stuff about how when \"you can't move forward, you move sideways\" and etc. resonated with my at times aimless wanderings over the past couple of years.So, in summation, you'll really like this book, unless you instead think it's interminable, rambling, and obtuse like this review."}, {"userName": "Daniel Clausen", "userReviewDate": "Oct 03, 2017", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/957634-daniel-clausen", "userReview": "I'm not sure where I stand on the philosophy in the book. In the early phases, I thought that perhaps I was responding negatively to the philosophy meditations because the book was a bit behind in the times (over 40 years old now). But then, as I went deeper into the author's Chautauquas, I understood the philosophy as part and parcel of a narrative that is not quite a narrative -- artifacts from a devastated psyche and the routine of a dad who is worried about his son. And then, I realized that this might be something more. More than philosophy, more than travel narrative -- it might be a new kind of practical reflective writing. Little slips occur in the narrative that makes it less a pretentious philosophy lesson and more of what the work really is -- groping in the dark; a desperate attempt to understand something. It almost seems like the book was written as one long exploratory essay during a bike trip, not something that was written after the fact or tirelessly sifted from eight or nine drafts. The first draftness of the book is refreshing!As a work of philosophy, the book would probably not be first rate. As travel writing, perhaps a bit less. But as something completely different, as a Chautauqua, it is in a league of its own. As an exploratory bit of writing on a bike trip across the country, it has more weight than a mere philosophical writing. The philosophy, too, demonstrates that there is a character at the center who thinks deeply, indeed where the very act of thinking might be a villain, a barrier, something to overcome. At times, I wondered why the author didn't write more about his son. Why not write passionately about the other people on the trip? Why did the author dwell so much on Phaedrus, this other self that had been destroyed? Of course, that question is important for his son's sake -- understanding his own madness might get him closer to understanding what's happening with his son. But then you realize that there is something with the act of philosophy itself that might be wrong. That the author must embrace another \"quality\" or risk being destroyed. Certainly, this is a book I can't really judge until I've read it one more time. But the point is, at least on a first reading, that this is a book I can't wait to read for a second time!And what should authors learn from this book? Perhaps this: the Chautauqua is clearly a new genre (though it has antecedents in Walden). If you're tired of losing at a game that others built (a genre or discipline), then perhaps it's time to create your own game."}, {"userName": "Wendy", "userReviewDate": "May 23, 2007", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/94089-wendy", "userReview": "According to family lore, my brother gave this book to my father when he - my brother - was in college. When my father read it, it apparently made a very deep impression on him, 'cuz he turned around and bought 4 copies and gave one to each of his children. I refused to read it for years because...well...because my father gave it to me. Sometime after college though, I picked it up and read it for the first time and, for the next 5 years, I read it once a year every June. Clearly, it made a very deep impression on me, too. Come to think of it, I should probably read it again this year...I love the narrative of the father/son motorcycle trip across the plains. I LOVE the sub-narrative about Zen and Quality and Values. And I love the theme of integration - how it all comes together in the end. Plus, it shed a little light onto my father's psyche and experience.

Pirsig, Zen and the Art of Motorcycle MaintenanceThere are parts of this book, and parts of this type of book I really enjoy. But at the exact same time, this whole genre of book (see: Ken Wilber and his oeuvre, especially A Brief History of Everything) really grinds and irritates.* Don't get me wrong, I love Greek philosophy and Zen Buddhism as much as the next guy (or gal) on Goodreads. No serious. ON my FB page, I think I put my religion down as: \u03b3\u03bd\u1ff6\u03c3\u03b9\u03c2-M\u00f0rmon; \u79aa-Mormon. I'm all about the search for Truth. I want to pick and prune it where ever it grows (East or West). But these pop-Philosophy/pop-Zen/grand theory of everything books seem to promise yaw||way more than they deliver. I DO get, however, how some people love it. I see it. I can feel it. It is seductive as hell for sure. And -- AND -- a part of me buys into a part of it. I just can't follow Pirsig all the way. Anyway, I'm not sorry I read it, just like after finishing a Malcolm Gladwell bestseller doesn't leave me with any sorrow either. I just feel like I've been given a light mental laxitive. Everything moves easy, and nothing is too damaging. I just don't really want to double down and read Lila. The Pirsig motorcycle is garaged. The seventies are over. I want a different sort of quality I guess.* given that statement, I'm not sure why I'm not as critical of Matthiessen's The Snow Leopard. Perhaps, it was the writing. Perhaps, it was less pop. But ye Gads, the mid-to-late 70s was a bumper crop for Zen Buddhist books in the US.___________________"}, {"userName": "Rebbie", "userReviewDate": "Sep 07, 2017", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/6582211-rebbie", "userReview": "I get that some people are put on a path for different reasons, and I'm very happy for all of the people who have found enlightenment or comfort with this book or any other.

I like to find out how many pages are in the current chapter that I'm reading. It seemed like, possibly multiple times in a single page, I'd double check how many pages I had left until I finished it... or how many pages left until the next act.Pirsig said:To the untrained eye ego-climbing and selfless climbing may appear identical. Both kinds of climbers place one foot in front of the other. Both breathe in and out at the same rate. Both stop when tired. Both go forward when rested. But what a difference! The ego-climber is like an instrument that's out of adjustment. He puts his foot down an instant too soon or too late. He's likely to miss a beautiful passage of sunlight through the trees. He goes on when the sloppiness of his step shows he's tired. He rests at odd times. He looks up the trail trying to see what's ahead even when he knows what's ahead because he just looked a second before. He goes too fast or too slow for the conditions and when he talks his talk is forever about somewhere else, something else. He's here but he's not here. He rejects the here, is unhappy with it, wants to be farther up the trail but when he gets there will be just as unhappy because then it will be \"here.\" What he's looking for, what he wants, is all around him, but he doesn't want that because it is all around him. Every step's an effort, both physically and spiritually, because he imagines his goal to be external and distant.The last time I read something which dropped my jaw more than this was in Beck's \"Everyday Zen\", when she talked about the \"Superstructure\".... and I don't think I scanned ahead more than twice the remaining 200+ pages.If you can stand the sometimes really hard sections, you'll be completely rewarded by the ending. And it'll make the tough sections more meaningful, too.In some sense, maybe that's exactly what Zen is.As the book personally relates to myself, he defined a central term that I've used a lot over the past few years - being \"pro\". Readers of the book will know what \"pro\" is and why, my attempts at being both \"pro\" and having substance are completely at odds."}, {"userName": "Knjigoholi\u010darka", "userReviewDate": "Jul 26, 2017", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/5952381-knjigoholi-arka", "userReview": "Dosta mazohizma za ovu godinu.
