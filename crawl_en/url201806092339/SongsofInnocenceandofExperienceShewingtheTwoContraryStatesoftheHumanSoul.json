They have stuck with me over several years and seem to resonate within me. I\u2019ve even considered having them tattooed onto my arm. Why these lines? You may ask.It\u2019s simple really: they say so much. Different readings can be made here, but the one I see most strongly is man talking to nature. Man questions it; he asks if he is the same as nature and if nature is the same as him. Is not the fly equal to him? Is not the fly\u2019s life just as valuable as his own? All life is precious, and what I read here is a man coming to the realisation that this is so. Nature is valuable, and no matter how high man may place himself all life remains the same; it is the same force: the same energy. It could also be a bourgeoisie facing a member of the lower class and realising the same thing, but I prefer to stick with the human to animal relationship. Nature is huge, the ecosystem is huge. And, again, no matter how high man may place himself he is still just another cog on an ever turning mechanism. In the modern world he has damaged the system, the environment, but he is still part of a greater whole. And his part is no more important than that of the rest of the cogs. What I read in Blake\u2019s words is an ideal, a projection of a semi-paradise; one man can perhaps reach if when he has gained experience he remembers where he came from: his innocence. Blake\u2019s poetry is marvellously deceptive; it appears so simple, but that\u2019s the beauty of it. Hidden behind the seemingly innocent childlike songs is a sense of irony, sarcasm and genius. The speakers of the poems describe the world as they see it; it is a mere reflection of their own limited perceptions; they see the world through a childlike and predetermined state. In essence, they see what they are meant to see, and nothing beyond that. Well, not until they gain experience and look back on their own folly. Even at this stage, Blake portrays the duality of the human soul; the two states coexist and inform each other. From this collection of poetry I\u2019m left with the impression that these two stages are necessary for human development, but not exclusively so; it\u2019s like Blake is suggesting that one should be able to see the world as an aspect of both.Throughout the poetry Blake also questions the meaning of standard religion and proposes his own ideas of a more natural approach to divinity. He believed that the gods existed within the bosom of man, and not in an exogenous limited interpretation. In this, he is a true Romantic poet. The more poetry I read in this age, the more I come to appreciate this idea. Blake\u2019s poetry stands out amongst the crowd though. He used a completely unique style to get his the two states of the human soul across to the reader. But, again, he reflects the movement; his poems have a heavy emphasis on the freedom of self-expression and can only really be appreciated in conjunction with the plates he engraved them on. He was a true artist: \"Tyger Tyger, burning bright, In the forests of the night; What immortal hand or eye, Could frame thy fearful symmetry?\" Indeed, for me, the comparison between the \u201cLamb\u201d and the \u201cTyger\u201d cannot be appreciated without looking at the images. The two poems are not simply about different animal types. They are about good and evil; they are a comparison of the badness and benevolence of humankind. The lamb represents the most profound sense of inexperience; it is innocence and pure: it is docile and vulnerable in its infancy. In this it is comparable to the Christian saviour: it is the best degree of humanity. The Tyger, on the other hand, has a corrupt heart. He represents the negative aspects of humankind, and can be interpreted as part of industrialisation, commerce and power. Through this comparison the narrator of the poems questions how a creator could forge two opposing states. What is the purpose of such a thing? When the experience section has been read, it is vital to go back and look at innocence. It changes the nature of the poems, as the implicit becomes explicit. The layers of meaning are multiple and complex. I could spend a day pondering over some of them, but for me the most memorable one is \u201cthe fly\u201d for the reasons I discussed: it will always stay with me."}, {"userName": "Tadiana \u2729Night Owl\u263d", "userReviewDate": "Mar 10, 2016", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/8734459-tadiana-night-owl", "userReview": "Tyger! Tyger! burning bright, In the forests of the night, What immortal hand or eye Could frame thy fearful symmetry?I don\u2019t think I would dare give any collection of poems that contains the above lines anything less than five stars. Luckily, although every poem isn\u2019t a winner for me (cough*Laughing Song*cough), there are so many immortal poems in this collection that I don\u2019t feel the least bit guilty for giving the collection the full five stars. I started collecting some of my favorite lines to put in this review (not even the whole poem in many cases), and when I got to three pages in Word I realized I would have to restrain myself from posting half the collection in this review. This review is still going to be on the long side, but you\u2019ll have to just deal. :)William Blake, one of the most well-known authors of the Romantic era, published this short collection of poems or songs in the late 1700s. The full title was \u201cSongs of Innocence and of Experience Showing the Two Contrary States of the Human Soul,\u201d which aptly describes the dichotomy echoed in most of these poems, with innocent Christian belief and pastoral joy in the foreground in the nineteen Songs of Innocence, and dark cynicism, criticism of man\u2019s institutions (including churches), and even despair playing a more prominent role in the twenty-seven Songs of Experience. In fact, many of the poems in the Innocence set have their darker counterpart in the Experience set. So you go from \u201cThe Lamb\u201d:Little Lamb, who made thee? Dost thou know who made thee? Little Lamb, I'll tell thee, Little Lamb, I'll tell thee, He is called by thy name, For he calls himself a Lamb. He is meek, & he is mild; He became a little child. I a child, & thou a lamb, We are called by his name.to \u201cThe Tyger\u201d:When the stars threw down their spears, And water'd heaven with their tears, Did he smile his work to see? Did he who made the Lamb make thee?Even in the more lighthearted Songs of Innocence, more often than not there\u2019s a dark undercurrent, a hint (or sometimes a slap across the face) that the narrator of the poem is being unintentionally ironic:\"The Little Black Boy\"My mother bore me in the southern wild, And I am black, but O! my soul is white; White as an angel is the English child, But I am black, as if bereav'd of light. \u2026 And thus I say to little English boy: When I from black and he from white cloud free, And round the tent of God like lambs we joy, I'll shade him from the heat, till he can bear To lean in joy upon our father's knee; And then I'll stand and stroke his silver hair, And be like him, and he will then love me.That last line is a heartbreaker. Even though the black boy sees that the white child is equally under a cloud, he still can\u2019t imagine being accepted by him until he looks like him.Similarly, we have \u201cThe Chimney Sweeper,\u201d where the young boys sold by their destitute families to be chimney sweepers\u2019 assistants \u2015 a terrible, cold, dirty job \u2015 aptly cry \u201cweep\u201d in their childish lisps instead of \"sweep\":When my mother died I was very young, And my father sold me while yet my tongue Could scarcely cry \" 'weep! 'weep! 'weep! 'weep!\" So your chimneys I sweep, & in soot I sleep. There's little Tom Dacre, who cried when his head, That curl'd like a lamb's back, was shav'd: so I said \"Hush, Tom! never mind it, for when you head's bare You know that the soot cannot spoil your white hair.\"And so he was quiet, & that very night, As Tom was a-sleeping, he had such a sight! That thousands of sweepers, Dick, Joe, Ned, & Jack, Were all of them lock'd up in coffins of black. And by came an Angel who had a bright key, And he open'd the coffins & set them free; Then down a green plain leaping, laughing, they run, And wash in a river, and shine in the Sun. Then naked & white, all their bags left behind, They rise upon clouds and sport in the wind; And the Angel told Tom, if he'd be a good boy, He'd have God for his father, & never want joy. And so Tom awoke; and we rose in the dark, And got with our bags & our brushes to work, Tho the morning was cold, Tom was happy & warm, So if all do their duty they need not fear harm.Such an indictment of those who mistreat children and the less fortunate among us!This next one has stuck with my since I studied it in college. Even if you have Christian beliefs (as I do), you have to admit that the institutions of churches have often been misused by those in power. The last lines are haunting: \u201cThe Garden of Love\u201dI went to the Garden of Love, And saw what I never had seen: A Chapel was built in the midst, Where I used to play on the green. And the gates of this Chapel were shut, And \u201cThou shalt not\u201d writ over the door; So I turn'd to the Garden of Love That so many sweet flowers bore; And I saw it was filled with graves, And tomb-stones where flowers should be; And Priests in black gowns were walking their rounds, And binding with briars my joys & desires. Notice how the meter and rhyme change in those last two lines \u2015 there\u2019s something inexorable about it.A few more: I appreciate the insight into the effects of anger and grudges offered by \u201cA Poison Tree\u201d:I was angry with my friend: I told my wrath, my wrath did end. I was angry with my foe: I told it not, my wrath did grow.And I water'd it in fears, Night & morning with my tears; And I sunned it with smiles, And with soft deceitful wiles. And it grew both day and night, Till it bore an apple bright; And my foe beheld it shine, And he knew that it was mine, And into my garden stole When the night had veil'd the pole: In the morning glad I see My foe outstretch'd beneath the tree.And the stultifying strictures and chains of society get a knock in \u201cLondon\u201d:I wander thro' each charter'd street, Near where the charter'd Thames does flow, And mark in every face I meet Marks of weakness, marks of woe.In every cry of every Man, In every Infant's cry of fear, In every voice, in every ban, The mind-forg'd manacles I hear.I\u2019ll go back to the Songs of Innocence to end on a more hopeful note: \u201cOn Another's Sorrow\u201dCan I see another's woe, And not be in sorrow too? Can I see another's grief, And not seek for kind relief? Can I see a falling tear, And not feel my sorrow's share? Can a father see his child Weep, nor be with sorrow fill'd? \u2026 He doth give his joy to all; He becomes an infant small; He becomes a man of woe; He doth feel the sorrow too. Think not thou canst sigh a sigh And thy maker is not by; Think not thou canst weep a tear And thy maker is not near. O! he gives to us his joy That our grief he may destroy; Till our grief is fled & gone He doth sit by us and moan.I highly recommend this collection, and you can find copies of it free all over the web.A couple of notes on bonus material: When this book was originally published, each poem was handwritten by Blake on a separate page with an original painting that he did to go with that poem. For example:They're worth looking up, and often add to understanding of the meaning or intent of the poem.Also, many of these \"Songs of Innocence and of Experience\" actually were songs: at least some of them were set to music. As far as I'm aware none of the original tunes used by Blake have survived, but different people since have tried their hand at setting some of them to music, with varying results. Wikipedia links several of these modern song versions of the poems. I haven't checked them out yet, but if I find any good ones I'll link them here.2016 Classic Bingo Challenge: 5 down, 19 to go."}, {"userName": "Darwin8u", "userReviewDate": "Dec 24, 2015", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/2294090-darwin8u", "userReview": "Billy Blake Who Made Thee?Poet Poet, burning bright, In the stanzas of the night; What romantic coquetry, Could frame thy fearful poetry?In what distant when or whys, roll'd the epic of thine eyes?On wet verse dare he aspire?What poet's hand, robs Shelly's pyre?And what meter, & what art,Could twist the cadence of thy heart?And when thy heart began to beat,What dread iambs? & what dread feet?What the motif? what the type, In what belly was thy gripe?What the image? what simile, Dare its deadly metaphors be!

The face of a lamb. The purity of maternal love. Solidarity. These are images chosen by Blake to convey his thoughts on innocence. When I think of innocence, I cannot help picturing in my head the greenest meadows, sheltered by the warm light of the sun, and the sound of a nearby river serving as a mirror to reflect your own thoughts. Such an idyllic setting is an invitation to contemplate your own soul. For me, the countryside is where anything can happen. I feel hopeful. I find rest. I make time stand still; I see bliss. And I accept the countryside's cruelty on a dark, rainy day. That is the inevitable dichotomy of any form of life.Innocence. To see the world through the eyes of a child. Something so necessary, and so distant. Something that we lose too soon, now.Simply too soon.Laughing SongWhen the green woods laugh with the voice of joy,And the dimpling stream runs laughing by;When the air does laugh with our merry wit,And the green hill laughs with the noise of it;When the meadows laugh with lively green,And the grasshopper laughs in the merry scene;When Mary and Susan and EmilyWith their sweet round mouths sing 'Ha ha he!'When the painted birds laugh in the shade,Where our table with cherries and nuts is spread:Come live, and be merry, and join with me,To sing the sweet chorus of 'Ha ha he!' (10)NightThe sun descending in the West,The evening star does shine;The birds are silent in their nest,And I must seek for mine.The moon, like a flowerIn heaven's high bower,With silent delight,Sits and smiles on the night.Farewell, green fields and happy groves,Where flocks have took delight,Where lambs have nibbled, silent movesThe feet of angels bright;Unseen, they pour blessing,And joy without ceasing,On each bud and blossom,And each sleeping bosom... (14)Different perspectives. The pain of adulthood. The fight between love and selfishness. The corruption of innocence and our salvation. Our preservation: the world will not eat us alive\u2014apparently. The fear of what is to come. Of the unknown. The gray despair of aging. These are some of the images of Blake's Experience. The Clod and the Pebble'Love seeketh not itself to please,Nor for itself hath any care,But for another gives its ease,And builds a heaven in hell's despair.'So sung a little clod of clay,Trodden with the cattle's feet,But a pebble of the brookWarbled out these metres meet:'Love seeketh only Self to please,To bind another to its delight,Joys in another's loss of ease,And builds a hell in heaven's despite.' (23)Ah, sunflowerAh, sunflower, weary of time,Who countest the steps of the sun;Seeking after that sweet golden climeWhere the traveller's journey is done;Where the Youth pined away with desire,And the pale virgin shrouded in snow,Arise from their graves, and aspireWhere my Sunflower wishes to go! (36)LondonI wander through each chartered street,Near where the chartered Thames does flow,A mark in every face I meet,Marks of weakness, marks of woe.In every cry of every man,In every infant's cry of fear,In every voice, in every ban,The mind-forged manacles I hear:How the chimney-sweeper's cryEvery blackening church appals,And the hapless soldier's sighRuns in blood down palace-walls.But most, through midnight streets I hearHow the youthful harlot's curseBlasts the new-born infant's tear,And blights with plagues the marriage hearse. (40)The lyrical voice of this fine poet stands out for its apparent simplicity. Blake knew his surroundings too well. He was aware of the social and political situation of his time as well as the spiritual concerns of human beings. And he transferred them to his pages to make them immortal. His sensitive and evocative poetry can conquer the most anxious soul and give it an ideal place to rest for a while.Jul 30, 14* Also on my blog."}, {"userName": "Bradley", "userReviewDate": "Mar 26, 2013", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/4213258-bradley", "userReview": "Well, one lousy review can't do Blake's poems any justice, not unless you're flush with time and the soul of a poet, yourself. :)I can say, however, that the title kinda gives the whole gig away. :) The first section is rife with allusions to Jesus and the second is full of wry and rather sarcastic religious revolutionary insights that I *clearly* appreciate much more than the innocent ones. :) Yes, love should be shown!

Thus the collection as a whole explores the value and limitations of two different perspectives on the world. Many of the poems fall into pairs, so that the same situation or problem is seen through the lens of innocence first and then experience. Blake does not identify himself wholly with either view; most of the poems are dramatic\u2014that is, in the voice of a speaker other than the poet himself. Blake stands outside innocence and experience, in a distanced position from which he hopes to be able to recognize and correct the fallacies of both. In particular, he pits himself against despotic authority, restrictive morality, sexual repression, and institutionalized religion; his great insight is into the way these separate modes of control work together to squelch what is most holy in human beings.The Songs of Innocence dramatize the naive hopes and fears that inform the lives of children and trace their transformation as the child grows into adulthood. Some of the poems are written from the perspective of children, while others are about children as seen from an adult perspective. Many of the poems draw attention to the positive aspects of natural human understanding prior to the corruption and distortion of experience. Others take a more critical stance toward innocent purity: for example, while Blake draws touching portraits of the emotional power of rudimentary Christian values, he also exposes\u2014over the heads, as it were, of the innocent\u2014Christianity\u2019s capacity for promoting injustice and cruelty.The Songs of Experience work via parallels and contrasts to lament the ways in which the harsh experiences of adult life destroy what is good in innocence, while also articulating the weaknesses of the innocent perspective (\u201cThe Tyger,\u201d for example, attempts to account for real, negative forces in the universe, which innocence fails to confront). These latter poems treat sexual morality in terms of the repressive effects of jealousy, shame, and secrecy, all of which corrupt the ingenuousness of innocent love. With regard to religion, they are less concerned with the character of individual faith than with the institution of the Church, its role in politics, and its effects on society and the individual mind. Experience thus adds a layer to innocence that darkens its hopeful vision while compensating for some of its blindness.The style of the Songs of Innocence and Experience is simple and direct, but the language and the rhythms are painstakingly crafted, and the ideas they explore are often deceptively complex. Many of the poems are narrative in style; others, like \u201cThe Sick Rose\u201d and \u201cThe Divine Image,\u201d make their arguments through symbolism or by means of abstract concepts. Some of Blake\u2019s favorite rhetorical techniques are personification and the reworking of Biblical symbolism and language. Blake frequently employs the familiar meters of ballads, nursery rhymes, and hymns, applying them to his own, often unorthodox conceptions. This combination of the traditional with the unfamiliar is consonant with Blake\u2019s perpetual interest in reconsidering and reframing the assumptions of human thought and social behavior."}, {"userName": "Jessica \u2741 \u27b3 Silverbow \u27b3 \u2741 Rabid Reads-no-more", "userReviewDate": "Mar 15, 2016", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/10336538-jessica-silverbow-rabid-reads-no-more", "userReview": "Maybe it's sacrilege, maybe it isn't, but I've never been a fan of Blake, artwork or poetry. *shrugs*It could be b/c I studied him alongside many whom I felt were vastly superior: Byron, Wordsworth, Coleridge, Keats, BURNS, SCOTT (in caps b/c LOVE my Irish poets), Hopkins came a bit later and is considered Victorian, but I don't care b/c LOVE him, too . . . \"The just man justices . . .\"Indeed, he does.

I know this probably takes away from the impact of when I really find something life-changingly perfect. Do not let my larkety-la-ti-da writing style in reviews, however, stop you from putting down whatever you're reading, and immediately adding this precious book to the store of books you've read.I can honestly say that, if the other things William Blake wrote are as beautiful and honest as this book, that he will be the first male poet to sit in the circle of my heart with Emily Dickinson, Sylvia Plath, E.B. Browning, et al. This book is an image of what poetry ought to be, this book is, when I wish that modern writing would remember what it means to be vulnerable, the book that I would beggingly throw before the writers of the world.I read this book in one day, it doesn't take very long. The book is divided into two sections, Songs of Innocence in the first half and of Experience in the second. The first half is poems that are the purest palest, most childlike of poems, pastoral in the dearest sense of the word - I have to tell you, honestly, if the book had only been this half, it would have been lovely, but imperfect. The second half was these songs that were... well, it was strange. Let me give you an example:THE GARDEN OF LOVEI went to the Garden of Love,And saw what I never had seen;A Chapel was built in the midst,Where I used to play on the green.And the gates of this Chapel were shut,And 'Thou shalt not' writ over the door;So I turned to the Garden of LoveThat so many sweet flowers bore.And I saw it was filled with graves,And tombstones where flowers should be;And priests in black gowns were walking their rounds,And binding with briars my joys and desires.But, then, the fascinating thing is, that most of the poems hearken back directly to the poems in the Songs of Innocence - sometimes they even have the same titles. Like this:THE DIVINE IMAGE (From Innocence)To Mercy, Pity, Peace, and Love,All pray in their distress,And to these virtues of delightReturn their thankfulness.For Mercy, Pity, Peace, and Love,Is God our Father dear;And Mercy, Pity, Peace, and Love,Is man, His child and care.For Mercy has a human heart;Pity, a human face;And Love, the human form divine:And Peace the human dress.Then every man, of every clime,That prays in his distress,Prays to the human form divine:Love, Mercy, Pity, Peace.And all must love the human form,In heathen, Turk, or Jew.Where Mercy, Love, and Pity dwell,There God is dwelling too.A DIVINE IMAGE (Experience)Cruelty has a human heart,And Jealousy a human face;Terror the human form divine,And Secrecy the human dress.The human dress is forged iron,The human form a fiery forge,The human face a furnace sealed,The human heart its hungry gorge.The poems all interrelate, and they all tell this story, in a way that is at once extermely simple to comprehend and deep so far beyond my real understanding that I could study it for the rest of my life. The poems in this book - no the book itself, because the poems are so much more empty outside their context - have the sort of power that scripture should have. Reading these poems, I felt this sudden, overpowering sense of ... I don't even know what! This is, without a doubt, I can unabashedly say, the best book I've read in at least 10 years. And I'm only 29. The. Best. Book. HAnds down. I cannot write things that will make you understand how beautiful it is, all I can do is beat you over the head with it, so you go read it. Seriously. Even if you hate poetry, even if you've never read a book of poems in your life, even if you think William Blake is a nutjob, even if you've read it in college and hated it, go close your door for two hours, and read it. Then, come back, and tell me if I'm just crazy, or if this book was great. OK, shutting up now. Sorry.

It\u2019s not like I\u2019ve actually read Blake beyond a few things in that course on the Romantics, but, well, I\u2019ve got this totally contingent personal association. So, how about id\u2019ing some of those Blake allusions which saturate our culture and which make Blake canonical in the sense that his work is a Quelle, deep and rich from which you might draw eternally for the sake of your art and your expression and your understanding. I\u2019ll begin.Daniel Amos\u2019 album Fearful Symmetry.DA\u2019s song William Blake. This song appears on the Vox Humana album, and on the lyric sheet is this Blake=quote :: \u201cMy work is visionary or imaginative.
