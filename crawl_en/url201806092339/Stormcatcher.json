I like that she is a Christian author so I can count on her books being clean and not graphic. Her mystery are interesting but not on the edge of your seat intense.

Stilted dialogueI admire authors who aren't afraid to introduce a relationship with God in her characters but not even that could save this.

I happened upon this one. Having always enjoyed books by this author, I downloaded it without thinking. Apparently this is book three in a series, although I think it was fine for a standalone book. I enjoyed it, as I expected to. However, I do like to read them in order, so I hope to go back over next few months and borrow #1 (Windigo Twilight) and #2 (Shadow Bones), which are apparently about the other two siblings that were mentioned some in StormCatcher. Also, I think these are older Love Inspired books that were recently re-released. Still, I did enjoy it! :)"}, {"userName": "Jason Carlton", "userReviewDate": "Jun 21, 2016", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/46481178-jason-carlton", "userReview": "I just love these books.
