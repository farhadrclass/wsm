I laughed so much throughout this book. I do believe Whitney and I are soul sisters. She definitely uttered some prayers I've said before. I think all is single gals have uttered something similar to \" Is there a fabulous, Christian man out there for me Lord? And when you send him, will You put a big label on him, please, so I don't miss him?\"I also adored Mitzi! She gave me a line I will be using in real life \"I'm indifferent to boring emotions\" Mitzi is the epitome of tough love and I'm not sure who suffers more, her or Whitney!There aren't vague references to God or a plot line that makes you doubtful it's actually a Christian novel. This is a real story with a main character actively living for God. It could be any single woman's real journal/diary.Whitney feels like one of your best girlfriends by the end. Can't wait for more Whitney Chronicles. If you like funny & love Jesus, this is your book!"}, {"userName": "Blskelly", "userReviewDate": "Mar 31, 2009", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/2178764-blskelly", "userReview": "Really fun read...lots of humor.

What a delight!! I must confess she is quickly becoming my favorite author. In this book, we follow Whitney as she faces an all too familiar struggle with weight management, and relationships. It was refreshing to find a main character with not only emotional flaws, but physical ones as well. While the book was a tad cliche in it's plot, the references to scripture and faith more than made up for it. I think that's my favorite parts of the Judy Baer books that I've read...the inclusion of scripture and prioritizing faith. I have a new one of her books arriving today, and I'm very much looking forward to diving into it as well. I recommend this book for pretty much any age group...pre-teen up through adult. There's something in it for everyone, and there's not a dull moment in it anywhere!"}, {"userName": "Beth", "userReviewDate": "Jan 12, 2016", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/51465722-beth", "userReview": "It's larger-than-life Christian chick lit :)The Whitney Chronicles is one of the books I turn to when I'm in need of a good laugh - I find the wit and characters hilarious! I don't often actually laugh out loud but I do with this book, and other ones by Baer. Sure, there are necessarily serious elements to the book, but the overall tone is cheery and intelligent. Whitney is not a character I thought I would relate to - many of her difficulties are things that I don't have any experience of - but Baer presents it all in such a way that it's easy to love and understand her and the other characters. I really enjoy Baer's writing style, with good amounts of Scripture throughout. One of my all time favourite books!"}, {"userName": "Natasha", "userReviewDate": "Feb 06, 2012", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/5719389-natasha", "userReview": "Whitney, single Christian girl, really wants a relationship. Written in diary format but most entries read more like scenes from a book, not a typical diary, which I liked. SPOILERSBest Friend Kim and hubby have baby boy Wesley. Kim is diagnosed with breast cancer, and falls into a deep depression. Feels like a failure because her parents tell her she wouldn't be depressed if she didn't have uncontested sin in her life. Whitney sees Eric, plane obsessed guy but sets him free. She sees business guy working with her company, thinks he wants to marry her, turns out he wants to poach her for his business. Kim's cancer Dr - Chase and Kim's hubby Kurt reconnect as friends and Whitney has a crush on him but he's not ready to date.

Her main crisis seems to be that she has too many men interested in her (which is a very annoying problem to have, from personal experience!). But, she also has issues with her parents (her mom has just started menopause and is going crazy), and at work.This book was probably my least favorite from these five, since Whitney seemed to be a bit too exaggerated of a character."}, {"userName": "Tanya", "userReviewDate": "May 17, 2013", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/10611638-tanya", "userReview": "Loved reading a book where the character not only says they are Christian, but actually shows they have a relationship with God. I did find it a bit strange that the author focused more on the relationships that weren't right for Whitney than the one with the man she ended up with. It seemed as if the ending wasn't well written. But the basic story was a great read.

It was a sweet, cute and fluffy read, and I enjoyed the journal format more than I thought I would. This was billed as Christian chick-lit, which I've never read before. (Christian, yes.
