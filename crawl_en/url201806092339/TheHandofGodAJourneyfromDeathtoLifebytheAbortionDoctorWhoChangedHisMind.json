Dr. Bernard Nathanson was a cofounder of NARAL, now the NARAL pro-choice America, formerly the national Association for the Repeal of Abortion Laws. Nathanson campaigned to make abortion legal and then ran one of the biggest abortion clinics in the country. After working at the clinic for many years, and supervising all the doctors, as well as performing many abortions himself, he became convinced that abortion was the taking of a life. Breakthroughs in fetal development research and embryology drove his conversion, which was not motivated by religious teachings. He became a famous pro-life activist, and produced the movie The Silent Scream, which showed an unborn baby being aborted in the womb, recorded on ultrasound. The film was very controversial and converted many peoples of the pro-life cause. It can still be found online in various places.In this book, Dr. Nathanson talks about his life, from his childhood to his adulthood. Since in another book, Aborting America, he chronicled his fight to legalize abortion and his work at the abortion clinic, he only brushes over that in this book. He talks more about his pro-life conversion and his pro-life activities. He discusses filming the silent scream, and describes what it was like being in the pro-life movement. It's more of a memoir than an actual pro-life book I thought, it is more of a biography or autobiography rather. Dr. Nathanson converted to Catholicism several years before he died. Therefore, he discusses his conversion in his book and gives his reasons for becoming a Catholic. He believes that God drew him into the Catholic fold, but the religious content of the book is not too overpowering. Therefore, it can be read by anyone \u2013 I am a non-Christian but I still feel I got a lot out of the book.I recommend this book to anyone interested in the abortion debate, or anyone interested in Dr. Nathanson's life and the reasons why he he made the tremendous transitions that he did \u2013 first from vehemently pro-choice to pro-life, then for an atheist to a Catholic. The book captures his life very effectively."}, {"userName": "Jaclynn", "userReviewDate": "Mar 11, 2009", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/740191-jaclynn", "userReview": "Bernard is a Jewish doctor who practiced many abortions at one time but is now on the pro-life side. How did this happen? This story is also an amazing one of how he went from a harsh childhood raised in the Jewish rituals to a believer in Christ, the Maker of life.Also in this book you\u2019ll find out even more facts about the beginning of life and just what happens during an abortion. Shocking and yet, I was not able to feel angry at this man who had committed these horrible deeds. Instead I found forgiveness in my heart and thankfulness that he now understands and stands for the value of life."}, {"userName": "John", "userReviewDate": "Sep 10, 2010", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/4270123-john", "userReview": "I am glad I read this book, but it was not as good as Dr. Nathanson's other book, Aborting America. This book restated much of Dr. Nathanson's life leading up to and including his years as an abortionist. It did not give as much detail as the other work, but was interesting nonetheless. The second half of the book was very interesting as it contained a more updated pro-life opinion of Dr, Nathanson. This book is a must read for anyone interested in the abortion debate."}, {"userName": "Samantha", "userReviewDate": "Dec 21, 2008", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/728681-samantha", "userReview": "*A journey from death to life by the abortion doctor who changed his mind* Dr. Nathanson tells his life story with unsparing honesty.

Martin", "userReviewDate": "Jun 09, 2017", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/17013765-l-l-martin", "userReview": "If you know even a little about the history of abortion in the USA, you have heard the name Dr. Bernard Nathanson. I stumbled upon his book at a local thrift store: The Hand of God, A Journey from Death to Life by the Abortion Doctor Who Changed His Mind. (Regnery Publishing, 1996). I could hardly put this book down once I began reading it! I highly recommend it.Sometimes book reviews are hard for me to write because the book \u201coverwhelms\u201d me in a good type of way, and this is one of those books. It gave me so much to ponder, that I hardly know what to say except: read the book yourself! In fact, I thought about not writing a review because I did not think it would do the book justice. But I must try, because people need to read this book.It is partly autobiographical about Nathanson\u2019s personal life and partly a history of abortion \u2013 directly related to his involvement with it. Of course, his personal life and abortion life interconnect \u2013 helping explain how he ended up where he did in life. Nathanson grew up in the Jewish culture, but would later identify as atheist \u2013 a fairly common thing among Jews. There was much tension in his family growing up, as there was ill-will between his father and his mother\u2019s family. His dad was a difficult man whom he describes as \u201ca deeply confused, fragile, driven man with no point to his life\u201d (page 33). His father was an obstetrician/gynecologist, and Nathanson followed him into this career. Nathanson\u2019s personal life was troubled, and he had several failed marriages. He expressed regret about the neglect of his son \u2013 being consumed with his career, he was rarely home.Nathanson was involved with abortion early \u2013 he was a key figure among those who began working towards the legalization of abortion in the 1960\u2019s. Some of these individuals were literally obsessed with the legalization of abortion, and it consumed their life. He was one of the founding members of the National Association for the Repeal of Abortion Laws (later renamed the National Abortion Rights Action League). In the 1970\u2019s Nathanson became known as \u201cthe abortion king\u201d and presided over about 60,000 abortions.What led the abortion king to renounce abortion and become a pro-life activist? The development of ultrasound. And ultrasound alone.He was callous with the many abortions he performed, even aborting his own child \u2013 with no remorse or emotional difficulty. He offers some thoughtful analysis about this callousness and the ability to disconnect from what you are doing. It was not until he saw abortions performed as an ultrasound recorded it (a new technology at that time) \u2013 that everything changed.Him and another colleague were stunned when they first observed ultrasound as an abortion was done. The doctor who did the abortion was \u201cso affected that he never did another abortion\u201d and Nathanson \u201cwas shaken to the very roots of my soul by what I saw\u201d (page 41). Nathanson emphasizes that his \u201cconversion\u201d from pro-abortion to pro-life was a purely empirical event.He came \u201cto the conclusion that there was no reason for abortion at any time; this person in the womb is a living human being, and we could not continue to wage war against the most defenseless of human beings. Having looked at the ultrasound, I could no longer go on as before\u2026To disrupt or abort a life at this point is intolerable \u2013 it is a crime. I don\u2019t make any bones about using that word: Abortion is a crime\u201d (page 128, 130).Remember \u201cThe Silent Scream\u201d? One of the tapes of an abortion being recorded by ultrasound was turned into this short film.Nathanson, in detail, talks about how abortion doctors tend to be the dregs of the medical field. At one point he made sure he had competent and quality doctors at his clinic, but it could not be maintained. Are all abortion doctors incompetent? No. But he explains the various reasons that \u201clured the competent away from the abortion clinics, leaving the vacancies to the inexperienced and the losers\u201d (page 121). At one point he refers to abortion doctors as \u201cquacks and hacks\u201d (page 123). Nathanson was not being flippant or insulting, only truthful, and he thoroughly explained why abortion tends to attract incompetent doctors.In a word so prophetic it stunned me, Nathanson said that his own experience \u201cleads me to the conclusion that the abortionist problem is inherent to abortion and likely to get worse, not better\u201d (page 119).The \u201cabortionist problem\u201d refers to abortion doctors tending to be incompetent, even dangerous. Note: there are incompetents in every field of medicine, but for abortion it seems inherent. Nathanson\u2019s prediction was accurate. Think of the recent horror of Kermit Gosnell, among others.The book also brought up the (then) new area of selling fetal body parts for supposed research \u2013 that was both fruitless and impractical. I\u2019d never considered the total impracticality of fetal tissue, even if legitimate ways to use it were found. He states \u201cThe prospects of real benefits from fetal research or tissue therapy are sufficiently far-fetched to make one wonder about the motives of its advocates.\u201d \u2013 Not much has changed since 1996, and the senseless horror continues.Nathanson remained an atheist, even after he became involved in the pro-life movement. But he was gradually drawn to faith in God and ultimately to Roman Catholicism. He was deeply impacted by the moral witness of the Christian believers he encountered as he became involved with the cause. I wish Nathanson had shared more about his conversion to Christianity, as he only talked about it more broadly and in tidbits.I highly recommend this book to you. It is a well written, honest memoir, with much to consider for anyone who cares even a little about the abortion issue in this country. That means you. Whether you identify as pro-life or pro-choice, there is much to ponder about the history and reality of abortion.It is also a story of redemption. Through faith in Christ, there is hope for everyone and sin can be forgiven. *This review was originally on my blog: https://lightenough.wordpress.com/201..."}, {"userName": "Kimberly", "userReviewDate": "Jun 02, 2008", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/1206776-kimberly", "userReview": "This book was so honest and so blunt.

Though some of the passages were a bit graphic and upsetting, it was a great read to understand the true reasons for the initial legalization of abortion and the unfortunate effect it has had on our society today.

It's an odd and really frightening volume, if you let it speak to you on its own terms, if you accept that those weird strained terms might in their way be sincere... The words \"I am afraid\" appear finally on the last page. Really on the last page. And their sentiment undoubtedly is the origin of it all: this book; Nathanson's conversion; Nathanson's activism; The Silent Scream. He scared himself... ventured out to the realm where there is no ethics, but instead of just pontificating or writing philosophy about it or dreaming up a fiction about guys named Raskolnikov, Dr. N went, he says now, and lived according to the no-ethics principles, killed, he says now, according to those principles: he did work in that space, in that void, work that whatever you think of it certainly is irrevocable in one, maybe several important ways... He did his work out there alone in the cold of space. Absent an ethics. (Now I don't really take him at his word when he says he had no ethics concerning abortion at the time of his pro-choice laboring. I don't believe that.) He had no affirmative ethics but there wasn't any set of principles in the way of his working to legalize, then promote and execute, abortion, and so that's the work he sort of fell into, he says, and time's passed, and he's aged, and he's gotten broken down, and he's gotten hurt, and he's left thinking about the coldness of the space, left with his life, with actions that he can't undo, and it feels to him now from the vantage of the writing of the book grotesque beyond conception. Twice this cat compares himself to Adolph Eichmann. That's how twisted it all feels when he looks back. It could be an existential novel, this book. But the power here stems from his having really done all these things, having done them into what he wants us to say he regarded as the void; the power stems from the horror he feels retrospectively when he remembers that void. This book is a recoil at the thought of the void. It's a dodgy, sententious, tendentious, pretentious as shit cry of really pitiable agony. To those of us still friendly with void-oriented ethical frameworks there's something here at least worth witnessing. Eh."}, {"userName": "Dean", "userReviewDate": "Aug 26, 2011", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/5780436-dean", "userReview": "The problem with Nathanson's book lies not in its arguments or scientific evidence (his first hand accounts of abortion are quite powerful), but in his meanderings into personal shame and a desperate grappling for religion as a man who can not live with what he's done. You could say this makes the account intriguingly personal and beautiful, but this depends on your current stance on the topics. While religious pro-lifers will probably nod along with the wonderful points within the book, someone more on the fence like me (a personally pro-life atheist who does not feel comfortable in banning other women from making this decision for themselves) will likely find that these bouts of desperation call into question his motivations just as often as they point to the overall horrors of an unquestioning life.To summarize - this book is wonderful but falls short if it is attempting to really push someone off the fence and into the pro-life camp. It perhaps inches one closer to understanding the brutality of abortion, and will affirm to anyone who believes in the promotion and protection of life that the act is both barbaric and horrible. It may even bring them one step closer to understanding the problems presented with Roe V Wade, and agreeing that perhaps leaving it up to a state level to decide would be more ideal. Ultimately though, despite learning much throughout the book, it left me wanting a deeper analysis on the topic. Perhaps this is not a problem after all, and I'd still recommend the book to anyone, though will still be searching for more myself."}, {"userName": "Paula", "userReviewDate": "Aug 09, 2013", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/10968713-paula", "userReview": "A fascinating account of how an abortion doctor changed his mind about being \"pro-choice\" when ultrasound technology was introduced. There was a lot of perhaps superfluous background information, but it was quite a short trip through his earlier years to his change of heart and subsequent pro-life activities. Also talks a bit on fetal tissue harvesting and right-to-die topics. Major downside - too many big words. If you want to make a point, use little words. Super-educated people understand them just as easily as the big ones, while the less-educated may be put off by having to drag out a dictionary for every tenth word.
