This well documented narrative tells how a very limited, backward looking, authoritarian Pope gave inches and then feet and miles in order, as he saw it, to protect the church.There is plenty to show Pope Pius as an enabler to Mussolini. It begins his withdrawal of support for the Center Catholic Party which hobbled Mussolini\u2019s strongest opposition and left its former members vulnerable. While anti-clerical Fascist thugs beat up priests, Pius complained to Mussolini about how women dress. The Pope condemned the Nazi takeover of Austria and the character of the Vienna\u2019s archbishop who signed all of Hitler\u2019s decrees (as Pope Pius had essentially done for Mussolini) only to soften his public comments and try to take them back. The Vatican was silent in the run up to the Racial Laws, and when they were on the horizon, the Pope tried to negotiate the weakest of all exceptions. It is emblematic that before his great speech where he would finally condemn Fascism, he died; years later, the speech was revealed to be as tepid as all that preceded it.The Pope\u2019s supporters might point to the Lateran Accords as an achievement, but Kertzer shows how this compromised the Church\u2019s integrity and ended its high ground. Pius XI\u2019s worst legacy may have been the elevation of those who would bend to his will. This led to the election of his successor, Eugenio Pacelli, sycophant to the end, who took the name Pius XII. This election thrilled Fascists and Nazis alike.While it is not the focus of this book, King Victor Emmanuel similarly fails the Italian people. He signs every bill Mussolini gives him. When the Racial Laws go into effect, worried about his health, he has his Nazi son-in-law from Germany plead an exception for the his physician.The author spent 7 years sifting through documents. I was surprised at the anti-Semitic statements in church newsletters and clerical speeches that surely had been available prior to the 2006 opening of the Vatican\u2019s pre-war archives. The Author\u2019s Note on the resources indicates how much information is there to mine. Hopefully someone will write on Mussolini\u2019s surveillance system, organizational behavior in the Vatican and the rise of Pius XII for the general reader.Kertzer has accomplished his goal (p. 411) of writing a book not only for experts, but also those who know little of this history. I highly recommend it for anyone interested in this period."}, {"userName": "Jeanette  \"Astute Crabbist\"", "userReviewDate": "Feb 09, 2014", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/796425-jeanette-astute-crabbist", "userReview": "I highly recommend this book for serious history buffs who read a lot of nonfiction and enjoy a high level of detail about the many people who played a part in historical events. I also recommend it for more casual readers of nonfiction who have a strong interest in this subject and time period. I say that with the warning that there are a lot of people involved, and it can be difficult to keep track of them and their roles and backgrounds.Kertzer is a meticulous researcher with expert knowledge of Italian history. The book gives much more extensive coverage of people and events than the title implies. At times it's fascinating, at other times it's a bit too thorough, but it's always extremely well written and documented. There is a wealth of notes at the back of the book, as well as numerous photographs throughout the book that greatly enhanced my enjoyment and understanding of the material.I found it especially interesting that Pius XI and Mussolini shared some personality traits. Of course, Mussolini's manifested in a more extreme fashion, but both men were ruthless and narcissistic."}, {"userName": "Max", "userReviewDate": "Oct 08, 2016", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/8079403-max", "userReview": "Kertzer shows how the relationship between Pope Pius XI and Benito Mussolini played into the rise of Fascism and anti-Semitism. Mussolini demanded absolute power and the pope demanded a dominant position for the Church. Both men were headstrong adversaries who cooperated as needed. Both sacrificed principle to achieve their goals. Their fears, desires, deals and surrounding intrigues would weigh heavily on Italy\u2019s fate particularly that of the nation\u2019s Jews.Mussolini started his political career as an anti-Catholic socialist. As a supporter of Italy\u2019s entry into WWI he broke with the socialists. He fought in the war and joined fascist groups in 1917. By 1919 he was leading the fascists and formed the National Socialist Party in 1921. Succeeding by violence and intimidation in a politically fractured Italy, his forces marched into Rome in 1922. He demanded and was appointed prime minister by the king. He was now the most powerful person in Italy.The Vatican was still living in the past. It still laid claim to the Papal States taken from it in 1870 when Italy formed. The dispute meant no formal relation existed between the Vatican and Italy. In fact the Pope would not venture into Rome which he did not recognize as part of Italy. Achille Ratti, a cardinal from a humble background in a small northern Italian town, became Pope Pius XI in 1922. He led a conservative Catholic view that was strongly anti-socialist and anti-Semitic. On top of traditional Catholic demonizing, Jews were now held responsible for bolshevism which Pius XI considered the Church\u2019s biggest threat.While skeptical of Mussolini\u2019s faith, Pius XI saw him as way to expand the church\u2019s influence. Mussolini likewise saw the church as a way to cement his own. They began an escalating series of quid pro quos. Mussolini granted the Church more power, freedom and praise in exchange for the Church\u2019s support for him. All the while Mussolini\u2019s goons took out dissidents, Catholic or otherwise. Pius XI dismissed these attacks on anti-fascists in his Church as the work of thugs outside of Mussolini\u2019s control. The pope would not criticize Mussolini since he felt the Church needed him to secure its position in Italy. Behind the scenes through envoys there was a constant tug of war between Mussolini and the Pope for power, but the pope was playing Mussolini\u2019s game. Unknown to the pope, Mussolini had placed spies throughout the Vatican hierarchy. Their daily reports to Mussolini covered Vatican internal discussions and even included accounts of pederasty committed by senior Vatican officials. In 1929 the Holy See and Mussolini signed the Lateran Accords. The Vatican gave up its claim to the Papal States legitimizing Italian authority in Rome in exchange for recognition as the state religion of Italy and cash. Pius XI was happy and Mussolini thrilled as his power continued to be validated. But soon after, Mussolini made official statements that implied the Church\u2019s rights were at his (Italy\u2019s) pleasure. The pope was angered but did little. While the pope rarely consulted his staff, key members were ardent Mussolini supporters who intervened on Mussolini\u2019s behalf when possible. Cardinal Eugenio Pacelli, who became Vatican Secretary of State in 1930, was a staunch anti-bolshevist and anti-Semite who was particularly deferential to Mussolini. Pacelli would become Pope Pius XII upon Pius XI\u2019s death.Mussolini wanted no doubt as to who was really in charge. Mussolini quickly stopped political activity in any part of the Church unless it favored him. The Church\u2019s rights were held to be strictly spiritual. When Mussolini shut down the Catholic Action youth group in 1931 Pius XI was furious. He got Mussolini to let the group operate but only with the stipulation that all Catholic Action youth leaders had to meet Mussolini\u2019s approval. Anyone critical of him would be dismissed. Mussolini was turning the Church youth group into his support group. In 1932/33 Pius XI would expend his political capital pressing Mussolini to prohibit \u201cImmodestly\u201d dressed women, to stop Protestant groups from organizing and to closely monitor Communists and Jews.In 1933 Hitler became the new chancellor of Germany. Pius XI at first was skeptical of him. One in three Germans was Catholic. Hitler needed Catholic support. Germany\u2019s ambassador to the Vatican conveyed Hitler\u2019s backing for the Church to the pope. But most of all Hitler\u2019s denunciations of bolshevism pleased Pius XI. German Catholic bishops had unanimously denounced the Nazis. The Vatican instructed the bishops to cease opposition to Hitler. The pope\u2019s order undercut the opposition Catholic Center Party which then quickly fell apart. The Vatican signed a concordat with the Nazi government \u201cguaranteeing\u201d the Church\u2019s rights in Germany in exchange for Catholic support. The Nazi\u2019s program of forced sterilization of \u201cdefectives\u201d was announced about the same time, which the Church ignored though clearly a violation of Church doctrine. Hitler did as he pleased and began closing Catholic schools. Hitler played the pope just as Mussolini had. The pope blamed anti-clerical Nazi elements not Hitler himself. Just as with Mussolini, Vatican Secretary of State Pacelli was much more deferential to Hitler than was the pope. Catholic conspiracy theories about Jews such as their comprising the leadership of Russia were widely published in official Church periodicals. Thus Hitler\u2019s anti-Semitic harangues, for example that 98% of Soviet leadership was Jewish, made perfect sense to Germany\u2019s large Catholic population. In fact Jews comprised 6% of the Russian leadership in the 1920\u2019s and less thereafter.In 1935 Mussolini invaded Ethiopia. Pius XI was against the war but as usual fell in line. Pacelli and other top Vatican staff supported Mussolini\u2019s colonialist war. The war was essentially genocide. Villages were firebombed, villagers wiped out with poison gas and their water supplies poisoned. Most of the free world including FDR and Americans were horrified. The Church made sure its publications in America backed Mussolini targeting the large Italian-American community. Italian victory in 1936 changed Mussolini. His ego overwhelmed him. He now believed himself invincible.The Spanish civil War in 1936 drew Mussolini and Hitler closer together greatly disturbing Pius XI. The Pope now saw that half of Catholic schools in Germany had been closed. Pacelli however still considered the communist threat paramount. He visited the US and met with FDR two days after the US election. FDR later said that Pacelli reminded him of Father Coughlin. Pacelli warned FDR of a Communist takeover of the US. Pacelli\u2019s real reason for the visit was to shore up his personal support from the four American cardinals. Pius XI was old and failing and Pacelli wanted to be and would be his successor. By 1937 almost all Catholic schools in Germany had been closed and the Nazi\u2019s began immorality trials of Catholic priest, monks and nuns for sexual deprivation. Finally the Vatican reacted. At the request of German bishops, an encyclical, watered down to not mention the Nazis by name, was issued critical of German violations of their concordat. It was read in German churches and it infuriated Hitler. Hitler closed Catholic publishing houses and seized diocesan files, which many bishops burned in advance. The Vatican now opposed Hitler, but still strongly supported Mussolini.In March 1938 Hitler took over Austria. Austria\u2019s Cardinal Innitzer lauded the F\u00fchrer and pledged his allegiance to the German cause. Mussolini who had wanted Austria under Italian control said nothing. The pope was stunned by both men\u2019s response. Pius XI forced Innitzer to publicly retract his support of the German takeover. Pacelli as usual tried to make sure that neither the Germans or Mussolini were too upset by the Pope\u2019s position.In May 1938 Hitler visited Rome for five days. Mussolini arranged huge celebrations. Swastikas were everywhere. He and Hitler paraded through the city. They swore their allegiance to each other as supporters including many clergy cheered. In July 1938 Mussolini began his anti-Semitic campaign. The Church and fascists differed on their definition of Jews. Mussolini aped Hitler. His anti-Semitism was race based. The Church\u2019s anti-Semitism was based on religion and culture. The pope wanted Jews to convert. If they would become good practicing Catholics they were part of the fold and no longer a problem. Church doctrine did not embrace the concept of race. There was only one humanity. The pope decried what he called \u201cextended nationalism\u201d angering Mussolini. The practical issue was marriage between converted Jews and other Catholics. Mussolini\u2019s laws outlawed this but the pope believed the Church controlled marriage as agreed to in the concordat of 1929. Again the pope\u2019s instincts gave in to his staff eager to kowtow to the powerful Mussolini. In August a secret deal was reached giving Church approval to Mussolini\u2019s anti-Semitic laws in exchange for a \u201cpromise\u201d that Catholic Action members could remain Fascist party members.In September 1938 Jewish teachers in Italy at all levels were fired and Jewish children were prohibited from attending public school. The Church did not object, even though the Pope gave a speech in which he lamented the new laws. The Vatican hierarchy excised those remarks from published versions of the speech. Pacelli and other Vatican officials again did everything to avoid friction with the Fascist government by covering up or modifying anything controversial the pope said or wrote. Some important Church officials, such as Jesuit Superior General and virulent anti-Semite Wlodimir Ledochowski, actually believed Mussolini\u2019s new laws were right, although they did not want to appear to criticize the pope. One prominent ardent Mussolini supporter was Milan Cardinal Schuster who at first publically praised the new laws. But amazingly on November 13, 1938, four days after Kristallnacht stunned the world; he spoke out excoriating the laws and characterizing Mussolini as a Hitler neophyte embracing a pagan creed. He instantly went from Fascist favorite to Fascist target. Many northern Italians wondered if one day Hitler\u2019s racism would target them. But Schuster\u2019s change of heart had no impact. The laws were not changed and Mussolini\u2019s staff worked with its key ally in the Vatican, Pacelli, to mute any outburst from the pope.In February 1939, the 82 year old Pius XI passed away. Lying on his desk was a speech and an encyclical he planned to issue on the upcoming 10th anniversary of the Lateran accords. Months before he had asked an American Jesuit priest, Father LaFarge, to help define the Catholic position on racism. The pope had been impressed with LaFarge\u2019s writing on black racial issues in America. The result was the encyclical that opposed racism. Ledochowski as LaFarge\u2019s superior read it first and made every effort to delay it, water it down and keep it from the pope. The pope got it anyway but his untimely death meant it would never be issued. Pacelli made sure it would disappear entirely. He had the Vatican Printing Office destroy all copies of Pius XI\u2019s speech. Pacelli became Pius XII. Only after Pacelli\u2019s death in 1958 would Pope John XXIII release parts of Pius XI\u2019s planned speech and only in 2006 was the full text disclosed.Under Pius XII, the Vatican became conciliatory and actively sought to improve relations with Mussolini and the Nazis. Pius XII removed the head of Catholic Action which Mussolini had long wanted but an obstinate Pius XI would not do. Even years later when Mussolini fell from power and was arrested Pius XII did not challenge the anti-Semitic laws.This revealing Pulitzer Prize winner is the result of seven years research into Fascist Italy and Vatican archives that only became available ten years ago. Kertzer dug deep producing a history rich in detail and convincing in its depiction of the relationship between the Church and Mussolini. His portrayal of Pius XI shows a conflicted unsophisticated pontiff easily handled by his subordinates. His account challenges long held beliefs about the role of Cardinal Pacelli as Vatican Secretary of State. Pacelli better known as Pope Pius XII is being considered for sainthood. Kertzer gives us a compelling study for those with an interest in the Church\u2019s role in anti-Semitism and the consolidation of power by the Fascist and Nazi regimes."}, {"userName": "Betsy", "userReviewDate": "Aug 31, 2015", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/33024987-betsy", "userReview": "My first impression of this book surprised me because I felt a glimmer of sympathy for Mussolini for having to deal with such an intractable man as Pius XI. That sympathy quickly dissipated under the barrage of Mussolini's Facist policies.Unfortunately, I never felt any sympathy for Pius XI at all. He may have meant well, but knowing that he could have helped with the downfall of Mussolini in the early days, instead, he lent his considerable support to the Duce which led me to question the pope's thinking. As the book progressed, I got the idea that Pius XI would have done anything to insure the supremacy of the Roman church. He may have detested Mussolini's dealings with Hitler, but he was never willing to risk losing the benefits of the Lateran Accords for the Church. He might have changed his mind about Mussolini, but by 1939 it was too late.The first part of the book was the most interesting. By the time it reached the discourse on the racial laws, I felt overwhelmed by the characters involved. The strident rationalizations about why some anti-Semitism was permissible churned my stomach.Finally, the author included some information about the Church under Pius XII who had served as his predecessor's Secretary of State. Appeasement seemed to dominate his thinking--anything not to infuriate Mussolini or Hitler.This is a well-researched book, but the problem is that many of the characters are reprehensible as is so much of this period in history."}, {"userName": "Donna", "userReviewDate": "Apr 26, 2015", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/1554616-donna", "userReview": "I won this book through a Goodreads Giveaway!I knew nothing about this subject at all, but had recently done a concentrated read on WWI, so this book picked up close to the end of WWI.I'm not Catholic so don't know much about it's history, and this book did a great job of explaining what was going on in the Vatican during a very tumultuous time in between WWI and WWII and the rise of Fascism and Nazism.

Mussolini had shown no signs in his early career of wanting to revive the Catholic Church's fortunes - in fact as he started off as a socialist, the opposite was true. His fascist lackeys had also spent much time beating up and terrorising hostile priests.Pius XI also showed no great personal enthusiasm for Il Duce, and his cult of personality, but he was prepared to compromise himself and the Church in exchange for a boost to its fortunes.Mussolini created the Vatican State to give the Pope extra status, and revived the Roman Catholic Church's role in civic life from the courtroom to the classroom. Protestant books were suppressed, girls in gym lessons were made to dress more demurely.In return, Mussolini got more than just silent compliance from the Catholic Church. Its backing gave his regime legitimacy and helped Mussolini entrench himself as dictator.And there is clear evidence of direct collaboration between Church and regime against what both saw as common enemies - Protestants, communists and crucially - and shamefully - Jews.Pius XI did have qualms about some of the antisemitic laws Mussolini pursued. He had deep misgivings about the more pagan-inclined Hitler, but he still saw the Jewish community as a threat to the Catholic Church. His opposition was more sophistry than substance.And Kertzer shows there was a significant strand of antisemitism in the higher echelons of the Church. Indeed, the Church was far from wedded to democracy - Mussolini's authoritarianism had an appeal to a clergy that believed in absolute obedience.This is a meticulously-researched and fast-paced account with a large cast of characters. Kertzer lays to rest the suggestion that Pius XI bravely resisted fascism. There were signs towards the end of his life that private disquiet about antisemitic laws would turn to public opposition. But we'll never know how that might have ended, as his death brought the election of Pius XII - an even more complicit prop for the Fascists.The quality of Kertzer's research justifies his Pulitzer. It's not his fault that the recent sex abuse scandals has reduced the shock value of a Catholic establishment prepared to put the interests of the Church ahead of what's morally right."}, {"userName": "Vikas Lather", "userReviewDate": "Apr 21, 2015", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/24372433-vikas-lather", "userReview": "David Kertzer can simply be regarded as one of the most finest historians of the Twentieth Century.

It's certainly negative as far as Vatican City and its corrupt operations during the time period involved is concerned, which is true to the book under review. However, like most American Catholics, I see a huge gulf between my Catholic parish life and what happens in Rome, so I didn't intend it as a screed against the church as a whole.]Kertzer struck a bonanza when the Vatican released decades of documents in 2006. He doesn't explain why they did so, but we all benefit. Can't wait for the next release because many questions remain.He begins this story of The Pope and Mussolini immediately after the Great War. 19th century European nationalism left the Roman Catholic church feeling bruised, battered, and wronged. By 1870, The Italian army had appropriated huge swaths of what the church had considered its territory in the name of the new Italian nation. The Holy See was now confined to a 100 acres in the center of Rome, an island in the midst of an Italian nation they refused to recognize. In fact, they didn't officially do so until 1929. Anti-clerical sentiment had banished religion from the public schools and, to the church's mind, put the clergy on the fringes rather than in the center of public life. Then, post WWI turmoil flummoxed the fledgling nation. The economy was a mess. Returning soldiers had no jobs. Many of the same conditions that made Hitler possible in Germany made Mussolini possible in Italy.Big difference, though. At least in the beginning, according to Kertzer. Mussolini had no real political philosophy or program. He'd been a socialist (almost a communist) for a while, but sensed that they didn't have the power point at their command, so he switched from left to right. He figured out that since the church feared socialism/communism above all things this side of the Devil--except maybe Jews and Protestants, of which there were few in Italy--he'd acquire huge leverage if he could position himself as the man who stood between socialism and the true religion.With the help of his black-shirt thugs, he engineered an election or two and ended up as Il Duce (Leader) in 1922. Crosses and pictures of the Pope went back into the classrooms. Was the church worried about his totalitarian tendencies? Nope. They never trusted democracy anyhow. It seemed to lead to separation of church and state, which seemed to the autocratic Pius XI and his cohort a violation of Christian principles. Top down was good enough for the church, so it should be good enough for Italy. And the rest of the world for that matter.Given that Vatican mind-set, it was relatively easy for Mussolini to buy off the church and lead it around by its mitre for quite a while. He lavished funds on individuals, helped repair churches and cathedrals damaged by the war, and allowed all sorts of religious education to proceed. His thugs often attacked religious youth groups and newspapers if they contradicted his policies, but he claimed the deeds were done by rogues he was trying to stamp out. He'd make a few arrests, but never imprisoned anyone. His network of secret police became a key area of cooperation. The Vatican had spies, too. Had had for a long time. Now they could work together to ferret out common enemies. Sweet.All of this went along fairly well for nearly twenty years. Things started getting rocky with the rise of Hitler. It wasn't so much the Jewish question. Mussolini had nothing, really, against the Jews. He had a Jewish mistress and no history of persecuting them. The church claimed it had nothing against them either. Yeah, they'd killed Christ and were out for world domination, but if they'd convert they'd be welcome. Pius XI and the rest continued to claim they weren't anti-semites, just against the Jews as they existed. (If that sounds familiar, maybe you've heard the arguments about how the church is not anti-gay. We love them. If they'd just stop being gay. . .) However, he saw it necessary to ally with Hitler, which meant embracing at least part of his racist philosophy. And, indeed, there were those in high Vatican positions who were virulently and unapologetically anti-semitic, Pius XI was getting fed up when he died and was about to say so. He even wrote it all down, but died before he could publish it and Pius XII suppressed it.That summarizes how all this got started. I was familiar with how it ended for Il Duce, but not for the Pope(s) involved. It's a shameful story of appeasement that makes Neville Chamberlain look like a war monger. According to Kertzer, there is a movement to canonize Pius XII, and given the nature of those isolated old white men who are able to rationalize and twist anything to their point of view, as well as to the odd and freaky nature of canonization itself, it could happen. Watch."}, {"userName": "Marks54", "userReviewDate": "Feb 04, 2017", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/5109654-marks54", "userReview": "This book is a history of the relationship between Pope Pius XI and Benito Mussolini, anchored around the Lateran Accord of 1929, which made peace between the Italian government and the Papacy and which helped legitimate Mussolini's fascist regime. This is not a flattering account of the Pope or the Catholic Church generally and it fuels arguments about the importance of the Church in legitimating both the Fascist regime in Italy and the Nazi regime in Germany, although that came more after the time of this account and involved Pope Pius XII rather than Pope Pius XI. In this sense, it is a parallel story to that of \"Hitler's Pope\" by John Cornwell which was published in 1999 - although Kertzer's book is more persuasive than Cornwell's, The popes did not cause either Mussolini or Hitler and it is unclear how far they could oppose these dictators or how the course of history might have changed had these prelates been vertebrates.There are a number of disturbing lines of argument in Kertzer's book that concern the tradition of political power in the Vatican, the prevalence of centralized - indeed totalitarian autocracy -- in the Church hierarchy, the long tradition of church antisemitism, the poor treatment of women, and the scandalous treatment of children and young boys (scandals around the world in later years, especially in Ireland and the US).Regarding the particular relations between the Church and the fascist government, Kertzer is fair enough in wondering about the need for prudence and noting that had the Church more strongly opposed Mussolini, things could have gottern much worse rather than better. Yes, hindsight is 20/20, especially with the unsealing of secret archives. The same arguments have been made about Pius XII, Hitler, and the Holocaust, although for that relationship it is less clear what could have been worse relative to what actually happened.This is a highly unflattering view of the Catholic Church that will not be surprising to many, especially in the US, where the church has been proficient in producing former Catholics. It is also unflattering to fascism as well, although in parts of the book, Mussolini comes across as more reasonable that the Pope and his Cardinals. It is also hard to avoid the book's nod to the present, in its telling the story of a crude but savvy populist strongman who could turn a good phrase in public speeches and enlisted the aid of formal religion in building domestic support. It did not work out so well for Mussolini.Overall, Kertzer presents a well told and reasonable account of some fascinating history."}, {"userName": "Bettie\u262f", "userReviewDate": "Feb 10, 2014", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/1108123-bettie", "userReview": "to hunt down, now where's my sleuthing kit..."}, {"userName": "Roseb612", "userReviewDate": "Aug 02, 2017", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/26455893-roseb612", "userReview": "Dal\u0161\u00ed z knih o tom, jak jsme si mezi V\u00e1lkami s \u00fasm\u011bvem a dobr\u00fdmi \u00famysly vybudovali re\u017eimy, kter\u00e9 n\u00e1s pak (skoro) zni\u010dily.

Since the fall of Rome to the Italian state in 1870, the popes had been in self-imposed captivity in the Vatican, refusing to recognize Italy as a nation-state and fulminating against liberalism, democracy, and the alleged perfidy of the Jews. Catholics were forbidden to vote or hold office in Italy until 1919, when Benedict XV backed the explicitly Catholic Popular Party.So things stood when a compromise candidate, Cardinal Achille Rotta, was elected Pope in the year 1922. Rotta had been a Vatican librarian with a fondness for mountain-climbing until Benedict asked him to represent the Vatican in Poland in 1918. His time there coincided with the Soviet invasion in 1920, and he left deeply convinced that socialism was a profound threat to Christendom and that it was the fault of a vast Jewish conspiracy. (Of course, these views were widely held among the Vatican elite.)Mussolini, who came to power later in 1922 in his famous march on Rome, had a long history of anti-clericalism and a string of mistresses, but he was an opportunist and quickly made it clear that he was willing to deal with the Vatican. Pius saw an opportunity for a deal that could reverse the indignities that republican Italy did to the church. If Mussolini was eliminating democracy and individual liberty, so much the better--the church opposed such things. Let the Fascists embrace Catholic teaching and have their secret police enforce Catholic social values, and Italy might be redeemed by confessional totalitarianism and become a holy bulwark against Jewish socialism.As a result, when fascist thugs murdered Mussolini's critics, the pope stood fast by the regime and forbade Catholics from allying with socialists to bring down the regime. Remarkably, when fascists murdered priests, the Vatican stated that such instances were caused by bad apples without the sanction of the regime--even as the regime refused to punish those responsible. Mussolini was happy to use the secret police to cover up pederasty by high-ranking Vatican officials, to teach Catholicism in state schools, and to punish Italian Protestants because the benefit of being sanctified by the pope himself was incalculable to the regime.The pope ignored the murder of Italian dissidents, but his conscience was not entirely silent. When he discovered that women wore scandalously skimpy bathing suits at the beach or participated in gymnastics events wearing backless leotard, he was sure to notify the regime of his deep concern for Italian morality. Similarly, he and other Catholic leaders were concerned that the regime did not take the threat from the Jews seriously enough. In the 1920s, the Vatican leadership was the most anti-Semitic element of Italian society.As he ruined so many things, Hitler ruined this happy alliance between the pope and the Duce. He initially signed an alliance with the church, but did not seriously wish to permit alternate centers of power in Germany. In 1931, the pope nearly split with Mussolini over threats to Catholic Action, a lay organization that Pius saw as crucial in Catholicizing Italy. Now Hitler conducted mass trials of Catholic clergy and went after Catholic schools, an even broader threat to the Vatican's influence in Germany.Moreover, Hitler's racial ideology troubled Pius. The reason why is crucial--not because of sympathy for the Jews, but because Nazi (and soon Italian) racial laws applied to all Jews regardless of their religion. This threatened existing Jewish converts to Catholicism and the universality of Catholic teaching. So the Vatican in fact supported anti-Semitic legislation as consistent with centuries of tradition, but only if they did not apply to converts. (In fact, the Vatican under Pius XII urged that deal to the Italian regime as late as 1943, _after_ the fall of Mussolini.)Hitler was unwilling to play ball, and the rise of Nazi Germany meant that Mussolini soon had to worry more about pleasing Hitler than pleasing the pope. Hence the final years of the pope's life were filled with acrimony against the Duce. (If only Pius had found a self-effacing fascist dictator, his vision might have been realized.) But by this time the rest of the Vatican hierarchy was convinced that conflict with Hitler and Mussolini could only hurt the Church. Led by Vatican Secretary of State Eugenio Pacelli, they watered down Pius's objection to the regime. An encyclical against racism was destroyed by Pacelli after Pius' death in 1939. Pacelli then became Rotta's successor (under the name Pius XII) after promising to play nice with the dictators.Kertzer's account is thorough and he clearly has the goods. While I sometimes found the detail a little dry, usually the book is livened up with the large personalities involved (Mussolini, of course; but also Galeazzo Ciano and Pope Pius XI was no slouch in the ego department). Befitting a book on the Vatican, I also found entertaining the casuistry of intelligent people straining at gnats while swallowing camels. (This review is far from a complete summary of the sins involved.) I also found it an invaluable contribution to my understanding of the rise of fascism in Europe, and worth reading for anybody who is interested in the history of Italy, Christianity, or World War II."}, {"userName": "Julie", "userReviewDate": "May 23, 2015", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/6344672-julie", "userReview": "Thoroughly researched and expertly written this book details the relationship between Pius XI and Mussolini in the run up to WWII. It does not present a flattering picture of the pope who was anxious to see the development of a Fascist Catholic Italy. He saw that through Mussolini the Church could regain much of the power it had lost in the previous century, and Mussolini realized that with the support of the Church he could become very powerful, very quickly. The pope appreciated Mussolini's willingness to censor books and cinema, to restrict the dress codes of women, and to prevent Protestants from proselytizing. Through Mussolini he saw religious education re-introduced in schools, crosses placed in government buildings, and ultimately the recognition of Vatican City as an independent nation. He had no issue with the absence of freedoms for the people under Mussolini because he believed that democracy, especially freedom of speech, was inconsistent with the absolute power required by the Church. He looked upon the Medieval times when the Church was without rivals as the high point of history. Mussolini in turn was willing, in spite of his strong anti-clerical upbringing and his disdain for religion, to take small steps to appease the Church in exchange for its support for his fascist government. The two men occasionally clashed over issues - especially the Catholic Action group which Mussolini saw as having too much influence that was outside of his control, and usually concessions could be found. However, as Mussolini became more megalomaniacal and infatuated with Hitler and Nazi Germany, the pope realized that he had less and less influence on what was happening in Italy and Europe. This book was fascinating. I love a well-written and informative history book and this was both of those things. Kerzer spent close to a decade researching and writing this book. Nearly 100 pages of notes at the end show how meticulous and broad his research was.I received this book as a goodreads first-reads giveaway."}, {"userName": "Eleanor Cowan", "userReviewDate": "Apr 16, 2017", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/3921303-eleanor-cowan", "userReview": "I imagine Historian David Kertzer as the now grown child once featured in 'The Emperor's New Clothes.'

They both came to power in the same year, 1922 - the one of a temporal realm, the other of a spiritual one and found a use to which they could put one another. The Pope used Mussolini to reach an agreement on the permanent return of, at least, the Papal States as an independent state and, in return, agreed to back Mussolini's Fascist dictatorship. Mussolini, on the other hand, recognized the importance of having the Pope's co-operation and agreed to support a Catholic state in Italy under the banner of Fascism with many benefits for the religion.With the Lateran Accords, Mussolini was assured a stable Italy supported by the Church and the Church, in turn, saw an end to anticlericalism and the brutalizing of its priests by the Fascists. All of this worked out well for both sides until Mussolini became more and more closely aligned with Hitler and National Socialism and started leading the country on a path to war. When he instituted the anti-Jewish laws at the behest of the Nazis, the Pope began to break with the Fascist leader. He was subsequently hailed as a great spiritual leader for his stand but it should be noted (and the author does) that his objection was not against the laws as a whole but only as they applied to Jews who had converted to Catholicism and been baptized. This Pope does indeed seem to have been distressed by all of the events he found himself involved in and sincerely seems to have tried to do what he thought best for the Church. It is hard to look back from an era of such changed views and make judgments. Still, an old adage kept going through my mind as I read, \"If you lie down with dogs, you get up with fleas.\""}, {"userName": "John", "userReviewDate": "Oct 06, 2015", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/5036642-john", "userReview": "Kertzer seems to have a thing for \"Secret Histories\" (or is it his publisher?).

He lamented attempts to take Jesus Christ out of the schools and out of the halls of government. He bewailed women\u2019s lack of propriety in \u201cthe increasing immodesty of their dress and conversation and by their participation in shameful dances.\u201d\u201cI am in the habit,\u201d he [Mussolini] told a deputy, \u201cof reading all the Italian newspapers, including those that don\u2019t deserve it.\u201dIn dealing with the pope, Mussolini continued his well-calibrated mix of pressure and reward\u2026 He bowed to the Vatican\u2019s request that only books approved by the Church be used to teach religion in the schools.The Duce was eager to use the power of the Church to solidify his own rule, but in his view the Catholic clergy were to be the handmaidens of the Fascist government, tools to ensure popular support for the regime.For decades, the Vatican had demonized those it saw as the beneficiaries of the much-vilified Enlightenment: liberals, Masons, Jews, and Protestants. It cast all as doing the devil\u2019s work, seeking to undermine people\u2019s faith in the one true religion. Throughout Italy, the Catholic press stoked this fear. Pius XI largely shared in this worldview. In his 1928 encyclical Mortalium animos, he forbade Catholics to take part in groups that encouraged interfaith dialogue.While Hitler was developing his own plan for dealing with the Jewish threat, the Jesuit journal considered the proper Christian response. It listed three possibilities. Best would be to convert all Jews to Christianity, but clearly this was not going to happen, for Jews stubbornly insisted on remaining Jews. The second possibility was to relocate Europe\u2019s Jews to Palestine. But the land could not support all sixteen million of them, and even if it could, the Jews would never do the necessary work, for they were \u201cuniquely endowed with the faculty of being parasites, destroyers have no aptitude and no taste for manual labor.\u201dThere remained only the third option, the approach that the Church had used so successfully for centuries: strip Jews of their rights as citizens.American newspapers increasingly noted similarities between Fascist Italy and Nazi Germany. \u201cA tyrant remains a tyrant no matter how benevolently he may philosophize and smile,\u201d editorialized The New York Times. Roosevelt took a much dimmer view as well, and in early 1936 he would publicly denounce Italian Fascism.The stalled Italian invasion [of Ethiopia] got back on track in February 1936, thanks in good part to the use of weapons banned by international treaties. The Ethiopians had no air force, and as the Italian planes dropped incendiary bombs on villages and poison gas on their fleeing inhabitants, they were helpless. \u201cIt\u2019s very entertaining work, tragic but beautiful,\u201d wrote Mussolini\u2019s son Vittorio of the air attacks, in which he, along with his brother Bruno and Edda\u2019s husband, Galeazzo Ciano [Mussilini\u2019s son-in-law], took part. When victims of the poison gas attacks were displayed to the world press, Italian newspapers claimed that the Ethiopians\u2019 deformities had been caused by leprosy.Unfortunately for Italy\u2019s Jews \u2013 both rich and poor \u2013 Mussolini was all too serious about translating his racial rhetoric into action. But he knew it would not be easy to generate popular enthusiasm for an anti-Semitic crusade that came as a complete surprise to most Italians. If the pope were to publicly oppose him, it might seriously undermine the campaign.If the Duce was not more worried [about his proposed racial laws], it was because in all the weeks of frenetic negotiations and brinkmanship, in all the weeks of the pope\u2019s lamentations, neither Pius XI, not his Jesuit emissary, not his secretary of state, not his nuncio had ever voiced any opposition to the great bulk of the racial laws, aimed at stripping Jews of their rights as Italian citizens. The Vatican had not protested the ejection of Jewish children or Jewish teachers from the schools, nor that of Jewish professors from the universities. Neither Pacelli nor the pope\u2019s two emissaries \u2013 the official nuncio and the unofficial Jesuit \u2013 had ever uttered a word to challenge the government\u2019s decision to treat Jews as a danger to healthy Italian society.A French bishop visiting Rome in mid-December found the sickly pope restless, sad, discouraged, and still complaining about Mussolini\u2019s failure to reply to his personal letter on the marriage law. \u201cYou are young,\u201d Pius told the French prelate. \u201cYou will live to see more horrible things that the Church has seen for centuries.\u201dFor those Italians who perceived any dispute between the Fascist state and the Vatican over the racial laws, what was at issue was not laws aimed against the Jews, for these the Vatican embraced, but Mussolini\u2019s flirtation with Nazi racial ideology, which conflicted with the Church\u2019s doctrine and its universal ambitions."}, {"userName": "Sharathkumar", "userReviewDate": "Mar 19, 2018", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/21280258-sharathkumar", "userReview": "This is a well researched and an amazing book.The book deal with the gripping story of Pope Pius XI\u2019s secret relations with Italian dictator Benito Mussolini.

While their mutual support didn't result in their achieving their ultimate end states, it had a tragic effect on Jews and, eventually, Italy as a whole, with major losses for the countries that had to battle them. It was a dark era for both the Catholic Church and Italy.More importantly, it is a cautionary tale for the current times in the United States. Trump received a great deal of support from the religious right, where many looked past his immoral behavior and language for policy gains they seek.While there are many important differences between Italy of the mid-20th Century and our country today that should prevent us from the catastrophe that befell Italy, we must not assume that the dark forces now evident are harmless or can be easily contained. Those who found Trump's bigotry offensive enough to reject him have to be vigilant to assure that it does not metastasize. Those who voted for him by looking past the bigotry they don't support in the hopes that he would moderate his views once in office and \"make America great again\", have played with fire and may be called upon to put it out if it grows.

It also sheds a light how the Fascist regime used Cardinal Pacelli to pursue Pius XI to be conciliatory towards Mussolini at a time when the Pope would personally approve newspaper articles prior to their publication. Speeches critical of the regime were edited as were statements concerning the war against Ethiopia or laws introduced by the government. Statements praising the nascent government up to a point claiming that Mussolini was send by divine providence were endorsed. Commonly Pope Pius XI is praised as being in opposition to the Fascists, but this seems to be only true referring to the National-socialist regime in Germany and to the Mussolini regime following the introduction of antisemitic laws which violated article 34 of the Concordat. In addition, the book also sheds light on the convictions held by Pacelli prior his ascendancy to the papacy - very important in the light of his papacy and current calls for his canonization which focuses on his role as Pope during 1939 and 1945 - years which are the most controversial of his pontificate."}, {"userName": "Socraticgadfly", "userReviewDate": "May 31, 2014", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/110433-socraticgadfly", "userReview": "This is not about the pope and the Holocaust; that's the next pope, Pius XII.For the unfamiliar, Pius XI is the pope who signed the concordat with Mussolini which gave Vatican City official recognition by Italy and the RC state church status in Italy. In exchange, the Pope agreed to officially support the disbanding of Italy's Catholic-oriented political party and to agree for restraints on the broad social involvement of Catholic Action, a rough equivalent to a souped-up Knights of Columbus. He also agreed to give tacit support, via Italian bishops, to most specific actions of Il Duce.After an early test or two, the agreement seemed strong ... until Mussolini got cozy with Hitler. Especially when he got anti-Jewish laws passed in Italy, and quoted the RC's own past history of anti-Semitism as part of support for this, they started fraying. At least from the Pope. Most Italian bishops continued to support the Duce.Shortly before he died, Pius XI had drafted an official statement he wanted to give to bishops at a conclave. Recognizing he might not live, he had copies prepared for distribution. The statement apparently would have sharply questioned the Vatican's relationship with Mussolini.But, he died that night. And, the Duce got the man who became his successor, Pius XII, then the Vatican Secy of State and chamberlain to Pius XI, to round up all copies of the statement. It was never sent.It probably would have made little difference, though Kertzer doesn't get into alternative history. The support of Catholic bishops for the Duce, plus Pius XII's rabid anti-Communism, assuming he would have been the successor if Pius XI died a month or a year later, would have seen to that.This is part of a series of excellent books Kertzer has written about the relationship of individual popes and the papacy to Jews in Italy. Anything he writes is worth a good read."}, {"userName": "Inknscroll", "userReviewDate": "Oct 09, 2014", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/28265051-inknscroll", "userReview": "(My review from BookTV; spoiler included)When I listened to David Kertzer present his book on BookTV, I found it to be a unique picture of a turbulent period that became frightening, and it had a fascinating panorama of people often forgotten in history. It is a well-researched history, and \"The Pope and Mussolini\" was not presented as anti-Christian (& not anti-Christian Catholic). It is solely recapturing the time period of the 1920s & 1930s in Italy mostly prior to Hitler's rise &, then, as Hitler rose to power (mostly before WW2). The Pope in this book is not Pope Pius 12th who was in power when Hitler was in power. Rather, it is focused on the Pope, Pius XI, who served prior to Pope Pius 12th. Pope Pius XI served during the turbulent and anti-democratic sentiments that affected both Italy and parts of Europe. This Pope had to learn to work with the new leader, Mussolini, who had risen to power through force and intimidation. At first, Pope Pius XI was positive and thought Mussolini could bring good change to Italy through economic reforms & etc. But, then, after a few years, this Pope began to observe that Mussolini was becoming a brutal dictator, wanted war, and wanted to align himself with another more brutal, rising dictator, Hitler.Finally, Pope Pius XI, who was struggling with his health, decided to draft a speech to speak out against Mussolini's policies & etc. Suddenly, the Pope's health deteriorated and he died suspiciously right before he gave his important speech. Of course, this has led to some conspiracy theories.Although my review is based on the author's review on BookTV, I have not been able to look at this book in person, yet. However, the author stated that it was thoroughly researched, and he was able to use newly opened Vatican archives on that time period, also. I look forward to reading how this turbulent history unfolded and led up to WW2."}, {"userName": "Andie", "userReviewDate": "Feb 20, 2014", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/14273148-andie", "userReview": "This will be a tough book for devout Catholics to read - the account of the story of two men, not as dissimilar are one may think, who both came to power in 1922. One man was a devout churchman while the other was a thuggish and womanizing bully who cared little for the sensibilities of the church. However, Pope Pius XI and Mussolini had many things in common: a love of authoritarian rule, disrespect for parliamentary democracy and an almost pathological fear of communism. Both used the other to consolidate their power culminating in the Vatican-Italian Lateral Accords of 1929 which established the Roman Catholic Church as the only religion of the state, extended religious instruction into all state elementary and secondary schools and effectively muzzled the Catholic Action organization and the Partito Populare Italiano (PPI or Popular Party) from any opposition to Mussolini's rule.Contrary to the popular notion that the Church opposed fascism, this meticulously researched book (seven years of research in the newly opened Vatican Archives of the period) shows how the Pope played a crucial role in making Mussolini's dictatorship possible by exchanging his supports of the regime for restored privileges of the Church in Italian society. As for fighting the anti-Semitism of the Axis powers, that, too is proven to be a myth. Only toward the end of his life, did the Pope come to regret his pact with the Devil, and then only because it infringed on yet another prerogative of the Church. Pius XI died in 1939. His successor was Eugenio Pacelli (Pius XII) who had been Pius XI's Secretary of State and a staunch defender of Mussolini's polices. As the Vatican opens its archives to his reign, one can anticipate an even more sordid tale to see the light of day."}, {"userName": "John Martindale", "userReviewDate": "Apr 20, 2014", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/4771466-john-martindale", "userReview": "For quite some time, I have been curious to learn a little about Mussolini. Not only did Kertzer satisfy my curiosity about the rise and fall of the Italian dictator, but the author allowed me to be privy to a very interesting history of Pope Pius XI. The Pope helped Mussolini into power and the church became the cheerleaders for fascism, in exchange for a multitude of favors; protection for the church (Which Mussolini's fascist had been previously persecuting), forced religious education for children, books the pope didn't like burned, American movies banned, Protestant missionaries barred, dress code for woman enforced, etc... etc... Both Mussolini and the Pope were extremely arrogant, hot tempered and had a firm belief in the virtues of authoritarian rule and tyranny. So yes, it was fascinating to get an inside glimpse of the power struggle. Neither of them felt they could manage all that well without the other, but oh with their inflated egos, they both were just terrified of it ever seeming like they were kissing the others feet.  I think I've noticed how in history, that the Popes who names themselves Innocent or Pius have ended up being the greatest devils of them all. Kind of seems like if one has to name himself Pius, that is saying something... if I recall right, the author hinted towards how maybe Pope Pius XII who came right after Pius XI was himself a pedophile. Oh joy, piety indeed."}], "description": "PULITZER PRIZE WINNER From National Book Award finalist David I. Kertzer comes the gripping story of Pope Pius XI\u2019s secret relations with Italian dictator Benito Mussolini. This groundbreaking work, based on seven years of research in the Vatican and Fascist archives, including reports from Mussolini\u2019s spies inside the highest levels of the Church, will forever change our understanding of the Vatican\u2019s role in the rise of Fascism in Europe.\u00a0The Pope and Mussolini tells the story of two men who came to power in 1922, and together changed the course of twentieth-century history. In most respects, they could not have been more different. One was scholarly and devout, the other thuggish and profane. Yet Pius XI and \u201cIl Duce\u201d had many things in common. They shared a distrust of democracy and a visceral hatred of Communism. Both were prone to sudden fits of temper and were fiercely protective of the prerogatives of their office. (\u201cWe have many interests to protect,\u201d the Pope declared, soon after Mussolini seized control of the government in 1922.) Each relied on the other to consolidate his power and achieve his political goals. \u00a0 In a challenge to the conventional history of this period, in which a heroic Church does battle with the Fascist regime, Kertzer shows how Pius XI played a crucial role in making Mussolini\u2019s dictatorship possible and keeping him in power. In exchange for Vatican support, Mussolini restored many of the privileges the Church had lost and gave in to the pope\u2019s demands that the police enforce Catholic morality. Yet in the last years of his life\u2014as the Italian dictator grew ever closer to Hitler\u2014the pontiff\u2019s faith in this treacherous bargain started to waver. With his health failing, he began to lash out at the Duce and threatened to denounce Mussolini\u2019s anti-Semitic racial laws before it was too late. Horrified by the threat to the Church-Fascist alliance, the Vatican\u2019s inner circle, including the future Pope Pius XII, struggled to restrain the headstrong pope from destroying a partnership that had served both the Church and the dictator for many years. \u00a0The Pope and Mussolini brims with memorable portraits of the men who helped enable the reign of Fascism in Italy: Father Pietro Tacchi Venturi, Pius\u2019s personal emissary to the dictator, a wily anti-Semite known as Mussolini\u2019s Rasputin; Victor Emmanuel III, the king of Italy, an object of widespread derision who lacked the stature\u2014literally and figuratively\u2014to stand up to the domineering Duce; and Cardinal Secretary of State Eugenio Pacelli, whose political skills and ambition made him Mussolini\u2019s most powerful ally inside the Vatican, and positioned him to succeed the pontiff as the controversial Pius XII, whose actions during World War II would be subject for debate for decades to come. \u00a0 With the recent opening of the Vatican archives covering Pius XI\u2019s papacy, the full story of the Pope\u2019s complex relationship with his Fascist partner can finally be told. Vivid, dramatic, with surprises at every turn, The Pope and Mussolini is history writ large and with the lightning hand of truth. \u00a0NAMED ONE OF THE BEST BOOKS OF THE YEAR BY\u00a0SAN FRANCISCO CHRONICLE \u00a0\u201cKertzer has an eye for a story, an ear for the right word, and an instinct for human tragedy.
