However this intensity differs because the reader knows who the killer is from page 1, but why is Eddie killing the elderly matriarchs of African American families? The second mystery of Manchester and Freeman matriarchs is slowly revealed showing the same symmetry and dichotomy of the main question, why. Marrying his reporter\u2019s skills of observation and knowledge of people, King shows the reader how a visible darkness shadows a neighborhood like that Manchester is from but can never go back to, it is his buddy ex-cop, Max Freeman, he enlists to help unravel the murders of old widows who should be safe in their homes.Back in his shack that he leases from the State of Florida, Max Freeman is still recovering from the notoriety and unintended consequences from his last outing into civilization months before when he hunted and became the prey of a child serial killer. Freeman acknowledges the subtle changes: he now carries a cell phone and checks his dock stairs for footprints and accepts the new park ranger\u2019s passive-aggression. So when, Billy Manchester said \u201chis voice straight and efficient. \u201cMax, I need your help.\u201d Freeman leaves his beloved river for the city streets without hesitation.Max is a little dubious at first to believe that little old ladies are being murdered after they sold their life insurance policies to an investment group, especially after talking to Detective. Richards. The Broward County ME office and law enforcement believe the women died of natural causes. Soon after one of the life insurance company sends down a bigoted investigator that he is forced to work with, Freeman agrees with his friend that something is not right. And without a beat or a badge Freeman falls into his cop-beat rhythm forming unlikely alliances in the black neighborhood\u2019s drug zone to catch a killer in an investigation that has its own twists and turns."}, {"userName": "Ed", "userReviewDate": "Dec 10, 2008", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/1077703-ed", "userReview": "I'm always a big fan for a P.I. tale. In this one, I like the Max Freeman protagonist as a transplant from Piladeliphia to the Florida Everglades that sets up an intriguing contrast between his former profession as a gritty cop and his current status as an edgy private detective. The prose stays sharp and clean. For some reason, AVD reminds me of Stephen Greenleaf's private detective. Good stuff."}, {"userName": "LJ", "userReviewDate": "Aug 24, 2007", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/250195-lj", "userReview": "A VISIBLE DARKNESS (Unlicensed Investigator/Ex-Cop-Florida-Cont) \u2013 VGKing, Jonathon \u2013 2nd in seriesDutton, 2003- HardcoverMax Freeman is an ex-Philadelphia cop now living in an Everglade swamp shack. He occasionally does investigation for his best friend, attorney Billy Manchester. In this case, Billy suspects someone is killing elderly black women who sold their life insurance policies to investors. Although the police have declared the deaths to be natural causes, Max soon agrees that things are not as they seem.*** There are a couple small weaknesses in this book: you know the killer, which does lessen the suspense, and the protagonist is physically described by seeing himself in a mirror. But I forgive those flaws as King has created a story which builds layer upon layer, showing the motive for the killings and who is behind them. The book is full of interesting characters, including Max and Billy, about whom we learn more in this second book, Det. Sherry Richards, drug dealers and gang members. The story of Max\u2019s father\u2019s death and the friendship between his and Billy\u2019s mother is almost a mystery within the mystery. King\u2019s description of Florida, particularly the contrast between being in the city or on the water, is particularly effective. This is starting off as a very good series and I\u2019m pleased to see there are more books waiting for me."}, {"userName": "Robert", "userReviewDate": "Aug 10, 2010", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/3569522-robert", "userReview": "The books in this series reminds of some really good chicken wings. Very tasty just not much meat on the bone. Kings writing style very closely matches that of Michael Connelly and that is a good thing. The story lines in this series of books has been very solid so far. I would really like to see King attempt to write a novel of perhaps another 100 pages in length. I feel this would add that much more to an already very Goodread. I did skip this book and read the third in the series before reading this, the second in the series. I found that the author does follow the story line through each book and that it is a good idea to read them in the correct order or some details may be missed. I also found as in many series that some will have a better story line than others. A Visible Darkness will be a good fit for anyone interested in a quick read."}, {"userName": "Georgiann Hennelly", "userReviewDate": "Mar 02, 2010", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/1946881-georgiann-hennelly", "userReview": "Max Freeman is seeking refuge from the familiar demons of his former life as a Philadelpha police officer.

Maar goed, daar zijn die aanbevelingen voor: een fan van Michael Connelly zal dit boek allicht eerder oppakken dan iemand anders. De stijl van King vertoont wel wat overeenkomsten met die van Connelly: eigenlijk is het allemaal middelmaat, maar toch kan je het niet neerleggen. Heel knap dus!De tekst op de achterkant van het omslag doet het ergste vermoeden: niet w\u00e9\u00e9r iemand die zielig is en dan toch nog een zaak gaat uitzoeken, maar gelukkig valt het allemaal mee. Hoofdpersoon Max Feedman zit niet zo lekker in z'n vel maar gaandeweg het verhaal gaat het al wat beter. De sfeerbeschrijvingen in het boek zijn dik in orde.

At any rate, Max has moved to Florida, where he is living in a rather unique hut out in the Everglades made available to him by a family friend, who happens to be an extremely intelligent black lawyer, and who becomes convinced that the apparently natural deaths of a number of old black women who just happened to have taken out large insurance policies and then sold them to an investment firm is a bit suspicious. As it happens, we the reader know that these are in fact murders because we are invited to watch them as they happen, so we start off knowing who the bad guy is and then we observe how Max works out the problems with figuring that all by himself \u2014 except that he is not exactly by himself, as he is accompanied by a very attractive female detective on the local police force and is also working with an investigator from one of the insurance companies. The author keeps enough mystery to himself to make the story interesting, however, and there is always the titillating adventure of watching Max and his detective friend become closer, with a lot of other incidental subplots keeping the story moving \u2014 such as the fact that the chief of police does not like Max and that the government agency supervising the Everglades wants to get him evicted."}, {"userName": "Kayeb", "userReviewDate": "Jun 26, 2009", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/1939764-kayeb", "userReview": "Another series I have read in the past....... this is the second of the series, so I will have to find the others. I enjoyed it......it is a book that results in my wanting to visit the Keys a bit more........tho the insects and such are not real thrilling aspects! But, he is descriptive, and I love the character of Billy...they are a bit like bookends to one another in their differences, yet the friendship is compelling and a fun to watch unfold. They are clearly are on the others' \"side\" and hold each other accountable. It is kind of Spenser and his sidekick in that the male friendship unfolds, but is never really addressed.....with the exception that Billy is NOT kick butt! This author brings in subtle humor and I find myself laughing out loud at times...... the 3 neighborhood \"hoods\" who serve as the watchdogs for some of the older people etc....... just plain endearing.

As a regular figure on the streets, he is recognised but at the same time very much ignored, as a member of street culture and who sees and notices more than he lets on he is the main suspect in the killings but if he IS the culprit due to his low IQ and semi literate state not to mention a drug induced fog is he capable of committing these murders alone?Is he following someone else's orders, is the near idiotic state all a ruse to allay peoples fears of him or is there someone in the background pulling the strings for their own nefarious purposes?

This, the second book, is a distinct improvement and demonstrates a much surer hand than the first. The characters of King's `detective', amateur sleuth, Max Freeman and his lawyer buddy, Billy Manchester are firmly established and their relationship plausible whilst the descriptions of the Florida flora and fauna are easy on the ear and reminiscent of James Lee Burke's Louisiana.In this outing Max is asked to investigate the seemingly ordinary deaths of a number of aged women in the suburbs of Miami and meets up, once again, with one time girl friend and police detective Sherry Richards. I wouldn't place King, yet, in the same league as Hecht, Deaver, Burke or Michael Connelly but the books are pleasant enough, easy going and well written and the characters engaging and believable."}, {"userName": "Gabrielle", "userReviewDate": "Oct 10, 2012", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/13030592-gabrielle", "userReview": "So far all thats happend is that theres this man that thinks he is invisible and investagator talking about his past.
