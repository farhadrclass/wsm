This book is easy to follow but there was just something missing that I can't quite put my finger on. It's still a decent read though. Also like the other books in this series there is some humour as well. Although this book is part of a series, it can be read as a standalone.

She set a very high bar a few books back and I keep thinking that she wont be able to surpass that one but every time that bar goes a bit higher.So here we are yet another absolutely brilliant addition to the Nikki Galena series. A totally unique storyline that sets the heart racing at the beginning and the suspense builds steadily and increasingly throughout the story. People are being burned to death and the clock is ticking will Nikki crack this one before another victim dies?I love Nikki Galena she is a feisty caring character and every member of her team give 100% loyalty and that loyalty is returned in full. Her personal life plays a big part in this story as she continues to build her relationship with her mother. Eve and her band of friends bring a bit of humour and uniqueness to the book. Nikki's relationship with Joseph continues to deepen and everyone is holding their breath hoping that the powers that be don't learn of it and throw a spanner in the works.I cant find the words to do this book justice. If you like Crime fiction, detective stories, psychological thrillers, police procedural ...... Then this is a must read.

This is soon proved to be the case when bodies start to be discovered in the ashes of bigger fires. Nikki and the team are puzzled by the lack of links between the victims.I thoroughly enjoyed Fire on the Fens which is another good mystery with plenty of action and red herrings. It might be my mood but I didn't find it just as gripping or tense as the previous novels and, despite the bodies, it's slower in tempo with the team struggling to get a foothold in the case and the reason behind it all is a bit flimsy. Still, despite it not being one of the best in the series, it is still a good read with a flowing narrative, plenty of reveals to keep it going and a host of, by now, familiar characters.Nikki and Joseph carry out their investigation, ably assisted by their team, their new superintendent, John Carson and Nikki's mother, Eve Anderson, the former high flyer with connections in the murkier corridors of power. They are now in a relationship so the time will come, due to regulations, that they will have to choose between the job and this relationship but with Cam Walker prepared to turn a blind eye that's in the future although it hovers over them. In the meantime they are two pleasant people doing a job they love.Fire on the Fens is a good read which I have no hesitation in recommending."}, {"userName": "Nicki", "userReviewDate": "Jun 04, 2018", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/8862640-nicki", "userReview": "Blog tour reviewAfter ex fire - investigator John Carson contacts acting Superintendent Cam Walker with his suspicions that a series of small fires that have been springing up all over Greenborough are actually the work of an embryonic arsonist.DI Nikki Galena,Ds Joseph Easter and the team find themselves investigating a complex,frustrating case in which innocent people who have led spotless lives are being burned alive.Every lead goes nowhere,they can find no motive,and are struggling to figure out if or how the victims are connected. Nikki and her team find themselves in a desperate race against time to work out who the killer is before someone else dies.Meanwhile tension is rising on the streets due to the hostility between the town's youths and a group of Satanists led by a charismatic businessman.This is a gripping thriller packed with twists and turns and red herrings that definitely keep the reader guessing although I did figure out one of the major twists quite early in the story.My favourite parts of the story where the gripping and intreguing parts covering the investigation into the identity and motives of the mysterious arsonist.The authors descriptions of some of the fires especially the final fire where so realistic and chilling,i had goosebumps whilst I was reading them.I love the interactions between Nikki Galena and her close knit team,I like how the team worked well together although their closeness and lack of disagreements can sometimes come across as unrealistic.After all everyone gets snappy and has arguments,don't talk for a while and then a bit later all is forgotten and everything goes back to normal. I really like how the other team members were able to contribute their own theories about the cases rather than Nikki always having all the answers.Of course Nikki`s mum Eve and her friend Wendy can't help getting involved and helping out with the investigation. I like Eve and her friends but it's going to get rather repetitive if they are going to involve themselves in every case that Nikki and her team find themselves investigating in future books.As with all Joy Ellis`s books this is a very well written thriller that holds the readers attention from the first word to the last. Although this is the 9th book in the series and some events from the previous book are mentioned,it can be read and enjoyed as a stand alone.

At first they are doing property damage, but then a man is killed inside his caravan. The man\u2019s name is Ronnie Tyrell. John Carson will be working on the case with the team.DI Nikki Galena and DS Joseph Easter respond to the scene, along with the rest of the team and John Carson. The poor man was locked inside the caravan. He was not a drinker, but there was found an empty bottle next to him. The investigation shows him to be a kind and good man. Who would want to kill him? At the same time, reports of a group of Satanists have moved into an expensive home in a nice area. They are being harassed by the locals. PC Yvonne Collins goes to interview the Satanists. She learns very little. The leader is a very charismatic businessman. But Yvonne smells a rat. Something about him makes her uneasy. The second victim is Clary Sargeant, an artist for a designer greeting card company. On an industrial estate, the doors were locked with Clary inside. She was the sister of the wife of the husband and wife team who owned the company. She was a very talented artist and offended no one. The team can\u2019t find any connection between Clary and Ronnie. With the aid of a talented psychologist named Laura Archer and John Carson, they come up with a unique picture of their arsonist. He is new to the scene and his signature is unlike anything they have seen before. Meanwhile Ben and Yvonne are coming up with almost nothing on their Satanist case. The odd tattoo on their wrists was the work of a local tattooist, but they wouldn\u2019t tell the tattooist what the significance of it is. Ben and Yvonne\u2019s suspicions are rising.The third victim is Jeremy \u201cJez\u201d Bedford. He lived with his parents and is reported to be a gentle giant who harmed no one. The killer lured Harry and Jez into the car by texting Jez that he knew something about a girl whom Jez used to know who died. Then they were drugged and Harry was pushed out of the car. And the curate, Leon Martin, knew all of the victims. Interesting little factoid. Interspersed with the story are little vignettes that show what the killer is thinking and feeling. While the police have no clue as to who the perpetrator is, John reads about a case of a \u201creluctant\u201d Firestarter. He tells the team about him. The reader gets to see the arsonist in action as he kills the next person, one Michael Porter. He wasn\u2019t as badly burned at the others, and Rory, the pathologist notes extensive burn scars on his body. At the same time, Yvonne interviews the neighbors and finds out that it was a van with a 13 registration plate. Nikki finally feels that the team is making progress. In a stunning conclusion, all is revealed. The identity of the killer was someone I hadn\u2019t even considered. The motive for the killings was just as surprising. It involved a cover-up at the highest level and many, many lies were told. Tragedy strikes the team in the denouement. This is a remarkably well written and plotted novel. It is perhaps the best in the Nikki Galena series so far. I absolutely loved it! It has action, drama, tension and some very fine police work. I truly enjoyed the asides about Rory\u2019s wedding plans and Nikki and Joseph\u2019s relationship. The story of Nikki\u2019s mom getting along so well after the loss of her friends was heartwarming to read about. This is a very fine novel and I heartily recommend it to anyone who loves mystery and police procedurals.

I haven\u2019t caught up with her back catalogue yet but that will soon be rectified. (Happiness for this Ginger Book Geek is discovering a series and learning that there are a fair few books to read to catch up with). Anyway I digress so back to the review I do go. I look forward to each book that she releases as I know that I am guaranteed a flipping good read. \u2018Fire On The Fens\u2019 was certainly a flipping good read and I absolutely blooming well loved it but more about that in a bit.I must admit that I absolutely love the character of DI Nikki Galena. She is one strong and feisty lady, who leads from the front. She is sassy and she takes no crap. Nikki is one of those detectives that has a very reliable gut instinct and if she feels that something is amiss or not quite right then it usually isn\u2019t. Nikki fully investigates a case until all avenues of enquiry have been exhausted and every lead has been followed up. Nikki does her very best for the victims of crime and their families. Nikki mucks in to do her fair share of the workload and she doesn\u2019t ask anybody to do anything that she wouldn\u2019t do herself. She sounds to be a lovely, kind and supportive boss, who will have your back if something goes wrong, which isn\u2019t your fault. Nikki hasn\u2019t been that lucky in her personal life but things have been looking up since she got together with her Detective Sergeant Joseph Easter, who just sounds like a total dish. They were apprehensive about letting people know that they are in a relationship as relationships between colleagues on the same team are frowned upon. Lucky for Nikki and Joseph, Cam Walker, an old friend of Nikki\u2019s, is temporarily assigned to the station as Nikki\u2019s superior officer. He has heard about Nikki and Joseph\u2019s relationship but he agrees to turn a blind eye. I was keeping everything cross that things would work out for Nikki and Joseph and they would get the happy ever after ending that they so deserved,Oh my giddy aunt, \u2018Fire On The Fens\u2019 is one heck of a sometimes haunting read, especially for someone (me) who has a fear of fire. That said, I did pick up this book at an ideal time for me. I was feeling very down in the dumps for one reason or another, my anxiety had increased and my chronic back pain was playing up. Boy oh boy, literally as soon as I picked up this book all of the previous issues were suddenly forgotten as I became seriously addicted to reading \u2018Fire On The Fens\u2019. The pages flew past in a blur and before I knew what was happening, I reached the end of the book which I had mixed feelings about. Don\u2019t get me wrong I was pleased to finish because I knew how the story ended and who the fire starter was but I was so disappointed to finish because I was enjoying the story and the writing style so much that I just wanted the book to continue. Usually I have the attention span of a gnat and I am easily distracted but not in this case because I was so into the story and loving the characters so much that I was able to shut out all other distractions. Reading \u2018Fire On The Fens\u2019 was like riding on a very scary and unpredictable rollercoaster ride, with lots of twists and turns and moments that you don\u2019t see coming but which hit you like a punch to the gut and leave you feeling breathless. There were certainly several red herrings and I didn\u2019t guess who the perpetrator was. \u2018Fire On The Fens\u2019 certainly kept me guessing.To conclude I have to say that Joy Ellis has another winner on her hands and \u2018Fire On The Fens\u2019 is one stonkingly good read. I would definitely recommend this author and her books to anybody. I can\u2019t wait to read what comes next from this brilliant author but in the meantime I can content myself with catching up on some more of her back catalogue. The score on the Ginger Book Geek board just has to be 5* out of 5*."}, {"userName": "LJ (On The Shelf Reviews)", "userReviewDate": "Jun 08, 2018", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/57968072-lj-on-the-shelf-reviews", "userReview": "Former fire investigator John Carson believes that the seemingly random attacks of arson aren\u2019t down to the local youth like everyone thinks. Fearing the person is escalating he contacts his old friend DCI Cameron Walker who is now acting superintendent. Their worst fears are confirmed when a badly burnt body turns up in a caravan. The victim seems to be a citizen with no criminal record and goes out of his way to help people, why would someone want him dead?Meanwhile a group calling themselves Luciferians have come to the attention of Nikki\u2019s team. They seem charming and charismatic but are they hiding something darker?More bodies turn up and its a race against time to find this deadly killer.So this is the second in the Nikki Galena series I\u2019ve read, the first being Thieves On The Fens. This book works perfectly well as a stand alone but I would recommend reading a few of the earlier books first. Having read the previous book I feel like I know the characters a lot better this time around and it didn\u2019t take me as long to get to grips with the story.As with Thieves On The Fens, there is not a dull moment in this book! It\u2019s fast paced, with plenty of mystery and intrigue with a murderer is that is extra diabolical, the thought of being burned alive is makes me shiver.I wasn\u2019t quite sure what to make of Nikki in the last book but she has really grown on me, I can see a really caring yet compassionate character. Another stand out in this book for me was PC Yvonne Collins, a smart and intuitive police woman but she\u2019s about to retire, leaving a bit of gap in the team. Also eagle-eyed fans of Joy Ellis\u2019 Jackman and Evans series will be thrilled to see a little guest appearance from profiler Laura Archer.I don\u2019t want to say too much more, in fear of giving away spoilers, but this has to be one of Nikki\u2019s toughest cases yet and the end, well wow, heart pounding doesn\u2019t quite cover it."}, {"userName": "Joanna Larum", "userReviewDate": "Jun 02, 2018", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/33843800-joanna-larum", "userReview": "This is the 9th in the Nikki Galena series but it is perfectly possible to read it as a stand alone.

I don't know how she does it but after thinking the last book couldn't get any better, the new one has scaled even higher peaks and is absolutely riveting. Don't pick it up if you've got an appointment to keep and don't expect to sleep or eat until you have finished it!There has been a series of fires on the fens but the arsonist is now trapping a victim in each one, so that they burn to death. None of the victims seem to have any previous relationship and even with the help of a retired fire investigator, the police are struggling to find a common denominator. Then they learn that certain investigations are being blocked from on high, but Nikki will never give up until she has solved the case and the reader is led along a twisting, turning, spiralling ride to the end.

Normally when there are two stories covered in a novel like this they slowly start to merge into one but on this occasion there was a very different conclusion. Dying in a fire must surely be the worst nightmare anyone can imagine and this case most definitely had DI Galena and her team stumped as they struggled to find the link between the victims and who the killer could be.

THE SETTING The Lincolnshire Fens: great open skies brood over marshes, farmland, and nature reserves. It is not easy terrain for the Fenland Constabulary to police, due to the distances between some of the remote fen villages, the dangerous and often misty lanes, and the poor telephone coverage. There are still villages where the oldest residents have never set foot outside their own farmland and a visit to the nearest town is a major event. But it has a strange airy beauty to it, and above it all are the biggest skies you\u2019ve ever seen.
