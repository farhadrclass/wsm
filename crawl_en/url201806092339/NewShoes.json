Normally, Ella Mae's new shoes would have been a pair of her older sisters outgrown shoes, but her feet have grown and she can't wear her sister's hand-me-down shoes anymore.Money is counted out and soon Ella Mae and her mom are off to Johnson's shoe store, where they are ignored by the salesman in favor of a white girl and her father who came in after them. Eventually the salesman acknowledges them, pointing out where the pencil and paper are so that Ella Mae's mom could draw an outline of her feet. Why? Because African Americans were not allowed to actually try on shoes back then; shoes were matched to the outline of a person's foot.Sadly, Ella Mae's cousin Charlotte tells her that she has had the same humiliating experience buying shoes at the shoe store. So Ella Mae comes up with a plan. The two girls diligently begin doing chores for neighbors, and all they ask for is a nickel and a pair of outgrown shoes.Finally, they have enough nickels and shoes to set their plan in action. The girls clean and polish and wash shoelaces for all the usable shoes. And when all that's done they open their own shoe store - Ella Mae and Charlotte's Shoes, price: 10\u00a2 and their used pair. And the best part of their shoe store is the everyone can try the shoes on.I really liked this book because it not only opened a window on a shameful part of American history but I loved the way Ella Mae and her cousin Charlotte came up with a way to fight back and solve a problem in a way that also allowed their friends and neighbors to be treated respectfully at the same time. And it shows how even kids can make a difference.New Shoes is narrated by Ella Mae in a very matter of fact way that immediately draws the reader into her world. For the realistic oil painted illustrations, Valasquez used a palette of earth tones for the background and but he shows the girl's dresses in soft pastels. In this way, the illustrations compliment the narrator's tone, making it feel inmate yet still giving the reader some needed objective distance to think about what is being said. Sometimes when we talk about things like the Jim Crow south and segregation, we tend to see the overall picture. But historical picture books for older readers like New Shoes are able to bring to light the everyday individual indignities and humiliations caused when these ideas were played out. Trying on a pair of new shoes is such an ordinary, everyday thing that most people probably don't even think about it, let alone think about a time when African Americans were not allowed to simply because of the color of their skin.

She's not allowed to even try on shoes before buying them. Her mother has to draw the outline of her feet for the shoe store man, because for Ella Mae to actually try them on would \"ruin\" them for white customers.Instead of fighting the system directly, she comes up with a very creative idea that both highlights the problem and provides a workaround, for others who feel the same way she does.The book is not only a slice of history, but an excellent way to teach modern children what discrimination really feels like."}, {"userName": "Andrea Cox", "userReviewDate": "Nov 03, 2017", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/16407549-andrea-cox", "userReview": "by Andrea Renee CoxI love this story!

Instead, her mother must trace around her foot so that the clerk can then find the right size shoes for her to wear. Since she has watched another girl, a white girl with blonde hair, try on shoes, she experiences--perhaps for the first time--how unfair and how unjustified prejudices are. Rather than wallow in misery over something that she is too young to change, she and her cousin Charlotte do chores to earn extra money or used shoes, and then open their own used shoe store where other African Americans can actually try on shoes before buying them. The illustrations, fashioned with mixed media and oil colors, make readers feel as though they are right alongside the characters, having their hearts broken by the unfair treatment at the shoe store, Ella Mae's mother on her hands and knees drawing her daughter's foot, polishing the shoes they plan to sell, and slyly, quietly, subverting the repressive system that existed in the United States during Jim Crow. The story is told so gently and so subtly that readers are quickly caught up in Ella Mae's experiences and how she turns things around. An Author's Note provides any necessary clarification for segregation for this story, set prior to the civil rights movement. This picture book provides an excellent and accessible introduction to practices that were common during that time period. While it might seem to be a small matter to be unable to try on shoes before purchasing them, all readers need to do to make this story keenly personal is to think about how different clothing and other objects look on the store shelves and mannequin and on their own bodies."}, {"userName": "Emily Kelly", "userReviewDate": "Mar 02, 2016", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/52787550-emily-kelly", "userReview": "While I was looking around the library for a historical fiction book I came across New Shoes by Susan Lynn Meyer. Ideally, I would love to teach K-2, but when it comes to historical fiction those grades can have limited books compared to older grades. This book is perfect to teach to younger elementary grades and even older grades. It goes into segregation in the south during the 1950s on a surface level that allows children to gain an understanding of how things were between white and \"colored\" people during that time period.During the 1950's \"colored\" people were not allowed to try on clothing or shoes in stores. They had to buy them and if they did not fit they were not allowed to return anything. Susan Meyer used this law to illustrate the resilience and courage of \"colored\" people during segregation. I read an interview with Susan Meyer about \"New Shoes\" and she goes into detail about how it's hard for children to conceptualize the past, but she's hoping through this book it allows them some level of understanding.Meyer suggests using this book to create a history lesson focusing on time travel. You can create a little time traveling machine that the students have to get a ticket to use. Once they are in the \"time machine\" there are historical fiction books that they pick from. I thought this was such a cute way to integrate history in younger grades and it would be a perfect way to integrate history and literacy."}, {"userName": "Samantha", "userReviewDate": "Jan 03, 2015", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/1380067-samantha", "userReview": "Ella Mae's family has a tradition of hand-me-downs when it comes to shoes and clothing, but when her older sister's hand-me-down shoes are too tight Ella Mae gets a chance to go shopping for a brand new pair of shoes.

Ella Mae, who normally gets her cousin Charlotte\u2019s hand-me-down shoes, is excited at the prospect of getting brand new shoes from the shoe store because her feet have grown too much to wear Charlotte\u2019s old ones now. Ella Mae and her mother are initially ignored at the store in favor of the little girl with yellow hair and he father; Ella Mae watches the other girl try on many pairs of shoes until she finds just the right pair. When it is finally her turn, Ella Mae tells the salesman which pair she wants to try on. What she didn\u2019t know though, was that \u201ccolored\u201d people were not allowed to try on shoes before they bought them. Her mother traces her foot onto a piece of paper and the salesman uses that to select a pair of shoes for her. Even though this was her very first pair of brand new shoes, Ella Mae is now sad instead of happy. She and Charlotte decide that this just is not fair and want to find a solution. They begin doing odd jobs around the community, charging only a dime and an old pair of shoes. They then use the money to buy shoe polish and clean up all the old shoes, which they sell to members of their community for a nickel and another pair of shoes. For many in the community, this is the first time they have ever been able to try on a pair of shoes before buying them. This story is beautifully written in such a way that the reader can truly share the emotions and feelings that Ella Mae experienced. It is difficult to find historical fiction for early elementary grades, at least in my opinion, but this is a text that can be used in a variety of ways. Black history month is something that most classes will study and, though this is a fictional story, it demonstrates segregation and Jim Crow laws in a way that even the youngest students can understand. Not only does it address the inequities and unfairness that African Americans experienced but also shows a wonderful example of perseverance and courage to create change. Additionally, this text could be used in an interdisciplinary study as it allows you to connect literacy to both social studies and mathematics by way of entrepreneurship and is a great example of the idea that you don\u2019t have to wait until you\u2019re a grown up to help make a difference."}, {"userName": "Katie Clark", "userReviewDate": "Oct 11, 2017", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/70730845-katie-clark", "userReview": "New Shoes by Susan Lynn Meyer and illustrated by Eric Velasquez is a fantastic historical fiction picture book that shows how anyone can make a difference in their community. This book is set in the American South during segregation. The main character, Ella Mae, wants new shoes, but faces discrimination at the shoe store. Through reading this book, I learned that during segregation African Americans were not allowed to try on shoes in a shoe store. They had to trace their feet and make a best guess about what shoes would fit. Ella Mae and her friend Charlotte find this to be unfair, and they decide to fight back against discrimination by making their own used shoe store, where anyone can try on the shoes. I think this book does a great job at illuminating the horrible injustices during segregation. It is important never to forget that just over 50 years ago girls like Ella Mae were facing injustices in our own country. Segregation can be a tough topic to talk about with young children, but a picture book can be a great way to introduce the topic. Children are instantly able to relate to Ella Mae\u2019s want of new shoes. Children will be surprised to learn that African Americans weren\u2019t allowed to try on shoes. This book would be a great addition to a classroom. I think that this book be best for 3rd-5th graders. This book would be a great addition to a civil rights lesson. It would also be a great way to show students that even children can make change in their community. Invite children to think of ways of how they might want to help their own community, just like Ella Mae and Charlotte.I highly recommend this book. The pictures in this book are beautiful, detailed, and realistic and accompany the story very well. The events in this story did not happen, but it is a fantastic historical fiction read. Most importantly, it features two young African American women who are making a positive difference in their community. African American women are underrepresented in children\u2019s literature, so this book is a great contribution to children\u2019s literature."}, {"userName": "Danielle D'Onofrio", "userReviewDate": "Apr 22, 2018", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/76204428-danielle-d-onofrio", "userReview": "This books was an amazing historical fiction picture book that is perfect for 3rd or 4th grade! It follows the story of a young girl, Ella Mae, who is in need of a new pair of shoes since her old ones do not fit anymore. Her mother takes her to the local shoe store, and their experience there exemplifies the culture of segregation and Ella Mae realizes how unfair it is that she does not get to try on her new shoes in the store due to the color of her skin. This was a WOW book because not only did it accurately depict the time period of segregation, but it also had a positive outlook when Ella Mae and her friend opened up their own store so that everyone could try on their shoes to make sure they fit! It was extremely comforting to see how the two girls took a frustrating and unfair situation, and were able to come up with a positive solution for their local community and neighbors. I am definitely planning on using this book to discuss segregation and how that affected the everyday lives of many people. It is also a great book to fight the misconception that after slavery ended, everyone was created equal. I think many kids assume that once slavery was outlawed, everything was immediately equal, but that is far from the truth! So as kids are entering a social studies unit on segregation, I would use this book as a tool to explain how the color of one's skin still affected how people were treated, regardless of previous laws that outlawed slavery. Racism was still, and is still, prominent in society, and I want my students to be aware that everyone should be treated equally and respectfully, regardless of the color of your skin!"}, {"userName": "Jackie Ostrowicki", "userReviewDate": "Jul 09, 2017", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/7396417-jackie-ostrowicki", "userReview": "Love this book (and illustrations--a must for any great children's book) about segregation and making your own way.

This book is a great book to help children better understand what African Americans experienced in the mid 1900's while going through segregation. Even though most circumstances in this time period were much more extreme and brutal then this shoe circumstance, this is an age appropriate circumstance for young children. The way Ella stands up against the way \"Johnson's shoes\" provide their services, reminds me of the way Rosa Parks stood up against giving up her seat.

She wasn\u2019t used to getting new shoes because her family at limited money and she always got her sisters hammy-down shoes. However, this year, Ella Mae\u2019s feet did not fit into her sisters old shoes. Ella Mae and her mother went to the local shoe store, Johnson\u2019s, in order to get another pair of shoes. Ella Mae was frustrated when a caucasian girl and her father walked in after them, and was serviced first. She watched as the girl tried on many different shoes to see which one would fit. When it was Ella Mae\u2019s turn, she wasn\u2019t able to try on new shoes. She could only trace her feet on paper and Mr. Johnson would find a pair around her size. She was frustrated and didn\u2019t really understand why it was different for her. Her mother informed her it was because of the color of her skin. So Ella Mae and her best friend Charlotte decided to open their own used shoe store where anyone could try on shoes to see if they would fit. The store turned out to be a \u201cbig hit\u201d in her neighborhood. This picture book format is great for younger students because the illustrations are vivid and readers can get a sense as to how the characters are feeling. This picture book would intrigue students because they may be able to relate to Ella Mae and be asking the same questions she did. Why do we have to have hammy downs? Why can\u2019t I (or Ella Mae) try on the shoes like the other girl? I believe the subject matter in this text might be a little difficult for students to comprehend, but it is a lesson that all students need to be exposed to.

New Shoes tells the story of Ella Mae and her friend Charlotte (both African American girls) in the mid-1900s in the American South \u2013 during the period of time in which Jim Crow laws were put in place to segregate Black citizens. The book focuses on the experience of the two girls under the Jim Crow laws \u2013 as many books featuring African Americans do \u2013 and how the girls choose to rebel against a system that was put into place to make them \u2013 and other African Americans during this time \u2013 second-class citizens. Ella Mae is mortified of the fact that \u2013 while out shopping for shoes with her mother \u2013 she is passed over by the clerk (in favor of helping white customers) and is not allowed to try on shoes, which was not allowed for Blacks during this time period. The reason this book was chosen, specifically, is because the story revolves around two young girls who face extreme discrimination who refuse to accept it. Ella Mae and Charlotte decide to help their community by creating a second hand shoe store where other Black people from their neighborhood can try on shoes freely without being discriminated against. 2)\tOne connection that I made was text-to-text with Claudette Colvin: Twice Toward Justice.

But, instead of remaining silent and accept it submissively, our main characters decides to take an active, empowered stand against discrimination and give the decent treatment their black neighbors and friends deserve if they need shoes and can afford them for a lower cost.Although mother\u2019s role is not fully developed and it would have been interesting to see it flourish as the girls did, or at least go through some transformation. This is a realistic way of addressing slavery as a phenomenon that made a terrible scar in people\u2019s lives and influenced mothers\u2019 ways to develop her life skills and her kids\u2019. The philosophy of working hard in order to achieve a change and stick to it until you make it is something we can also perceive in these little girls that had to perform stereotyped women\u2019s tasks such as: taking care of babies, wash dishes, etc. to finally open their little shoe store and involving the community in their own change."}, {"userName": "Heather", "userReviewDate": "Feb 14, 2016", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/50643603-heather", "userReview": "New Shoes, By Susan Lynn MeyerRationaleNew Shoes is set in the 1950s. The main character is Ella Mae, an African-American girl. Ella Mae is finally allowed to get new shoes since she has outgrown her sister\u2019s hand-me-down clothes. However, her excitement is turned to anger and confusion because the white salesman helps her last and won\u2019t let her try on the shoes. Her mother has to trace her feet onto paper to get Ella Mae\u2019s shoe size. Ella Mae and her friend Charlotte come up with an idea. They buy used shoes from their neighbors, clean them up, and open their own shoe store. The last line of the book states that anyone can try on their shoes. The story is a great example of nonviolent resistance and the change it can make. The girls are strong, intelligent girls who respond to an unfair situation in a positive way.ConnectionThis book reminds me of the bus boycotts and sit-ins during the Civil Rights movement. The girl's use of nonviolent methods to restore their dignity makes me think of how we can stand up to bigotry and unfairness by peacefully choosing to not support those who treat others badly.QuestionsLevel 1-Describe what happened to Ella Mae at the shoe store.Level 2-Can you provide a definition for discrimination?Level 3-Do you know of other instances where groups of people have been discriminated against?Level 4-Investigate the different ways African-Americans have struggled to have equal rights.Level 5-Do you agree with the girl\u2019s solution?

It is time for Ella Mae to get a new pair of shoes. Her mother and she go to the shoe store to buy her brand new pair of shoes. But, they shoe store owner favors a white girl and her father over Ella Mae and her mother. He also makes them draw their foot to check the size, instead of allowing them to try the shoe on; all because they are African-American. This shows the segregation within the south and the separation of white people and African Americans. Text-to-Self: While I did not connect directly to the segregation aspect of this story, I did connect to Ella Mae\u2019s excited in receiving her own pair of brand new shoes. She is used to having to wear hand-me-downs from her older sister, so this was something special. I have always worn hand-me-downs that were given to my mom from family friends. Most of my clothes were given to us. Whenever I got to get my own new clothes, it was a very exciting time. I can understand Ella Mae\u2019s disappointment in her treatment at the store.

The personal nature of this story highlights for young children the indignity of segregation and prejudice. A young girl excited about the possibility of new shoes ( clear luxury in her family) goes to the shoe story only to have to wait tile a white customer is served first (even though the young girl had entered first) and then told she cannot try on the shoes but has to buy them based on a pencil outline of her foot, and all because of the color of her skin. But she and another friend come up with a plan and create their own shoe store, with a bit of polish and scrubbed laces and good will. While the story is fictionalized, the situation was all too real in the South prior to the passing of civil rights legislation and even sometimes afterwards. The text is straightforward, the illustrations capture the emotions (her facial expression as her feet are outlined instead of placed in new shoes), the wariness of her mother in the story, the sauciness of the young entrepreneurs in their shop. A noteworthy book that can prompt a lot of discussion.

One day, Charlotte's old shoes are too tight for Ella Mae and so the girl gets to buy a brand new pair of shoes. At Johnson's General Store, however, Ella Mae is treated differently from another customer with \"yellow pigtails.\" The treatment is because of the color of her skin: she is served second even though she arrived first, and she is not allowed to try on any of the beautiful new shoes. With a little brainstorming and some hard work, Ella Mae and Charlotte come up with a plan to allow everyone to try on shoes before they buy them. The illustrations paint an accurate historical picture of the 1950s and do well enough to bring out the characters' emotions, which may not otherwise be noticed in the text. An author's note at the end explains Jim Crow, the civil rights movement, and the evolution of language used to describe African Americans. The use of a lesser-known Jim Crow situation makes it stand out from other titles dedicated to this topic, but the message is very similar.

Blacks could not try on shoes, dresses or hats in stores. If you bought it and it didn't fit properly, there was no taking it back for a proper fit.

Meyer and Velasquez make no effort to soften the hurt of these discriminatory practices, but the ingenuity of Ellie Mae and Charlotte, along with the history note at the end of the book, shows one of the ways that African American people pushed back against the law. You'll want to make sure to accompany this lesson with a more in-depth discussion, but it makes a perfect lead-in to that discussion.The artwork of Velasquez conveys plenty of emotion, as well as giving readers a real feel for the era, with well-designed backgrounds which could easily be Anytown, USA.This is well-placed in any classroom or library, though the repeated readings that would come from having it in a private home may not be suited to the serious subject matter. However, if you think it fits in your home, go right ahead!
