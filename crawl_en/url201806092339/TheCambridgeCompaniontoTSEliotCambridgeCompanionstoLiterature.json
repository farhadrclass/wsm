The fact that different writers cover different topics is one of the strengths of the series. Good essay on Eliot's allusive practice, as well as his impact on Anglo-American poety. His various critical activities are dicussed in three separate essays."}, {"userName": "Noah", "userReviewDate": "May 02, 2007", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/73955-noah", "userReview": "As with many of the Cambridge Companion series, this guide offers an excellent introduction to the various trends of Eliot studies, as well as some suggestions of its current interests."}], "description": "An international team of leading T.S.
