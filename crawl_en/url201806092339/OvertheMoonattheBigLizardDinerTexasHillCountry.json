I had never even heard of Wingate until I stumbled across someone selling a number of books, including the second one in the trilogy, Lone Star Cafe. I got that and checked the others out from the library to read the complete series. I have to say, that dollar spent was well-worth discovering these stories! I especially related to the character Lindsey, a single mother who has been burned in the past, and is afraid to love again. As Lindsey gained insight during a horse psychology class, I felt like I was taking in the same lessons. After reading the previous books, I was concerned that the stories might get too predictable like other romances tend to, but this one took a couple of unexpected turns that made me get into the story even more. After this series, I'm definitely a new Lisa Wingate fan, and plan to look into some of her other series soon!"}, {"userName": "Joanne", "userReviewDate": "Aug 10, 2017", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/9335510-joanne", "userReview": "Third in the Texas series for Wingate and I thought it was the best. Kind of thought the second was too much like the first. The third has a kicker thrown in in the form of a bag shaggy lost Great Pyrenees sheepdog.

After her ex-husband ditched her upon learning of the impending arrival of their daughter, Lindsay stopped traveling the world and instead took a job in the basement of a museum in Denver, converting her talents for archaeological discovery into those of restoration and cataloging. She wrapped her life around her daughter, Sydney, keeping new people at bay after learning the hard way that men can't be trusted. However, that approach led to fundamental loneliness and an emotional collapse the moment her ex suddenly decided he wanted to be a part of Sydney's life and took her to Mexico for the summer.Lindsay's twin sister, Laura, and their friend Collie hatch a plan to drag Lindsay out of her despair: Laura invites Lindsay for a visit to Texas, and Collie begs for her help discovering who has stolen dinosaur tracks from a local ranch. Collie persuades Lindsay to go \"undercover\" at the ranch as a student in the horse psychology camp run by the owner's granddaughter, since it's possible the theft was an inside job. On the way to the ranch, Lindsay nearly runs over a giant dog chased by angry cowboys, and her defense of the dog leads to a temporary adoption--although which of them did the adopting is a matter of debate. One of the cowboys turns out to be the veterinarian grandson of the same ranch owner whose dinosaur tracks had been stolen, and over the next few days, Zack and Lindsay fall in love while repairing windmills and chasing her escape-artist dog across fields to the Lover's Oak. Once the townsfolk hear they were seen kissing under the famous tree, curiosity is at a fever pitch, and the wedding a foregone conclusion. Unfortunately, Lindsay has Trust Issues with a capital \"T\" and no faith that it's possible to have a relationship with a USDA vet who lives thousands of miles away. I'm not typically one to notice language unless it's unusually bad (especially grammar and typos) or unusually good. While listening to this audiobook, I noticed not only Johanna Parker's lovely voice, but also the lush, lyrical, evocative, and amusing descriptions and idioms Lisa Wingate used to tell the story. The beautiful words helped me cope with the main character's stubborn refusal to pay more attention to present actions than past hurts. Seriously--Lindsay is in dire need of Alison Armstrong's workshops on understanding men & women! The horse psychology class was a big step in the right direction, yet it's fairly improbable that Lindsay so quickly went from being a failure to a star pupil, given her inability to fully translate the early skills into the human world. I think she needed a bigger \"Aha!\" moment first, like some of the other students seemed to have. That would have made it a 5-star book, in my opinion.For readers' advisors: character and language doorways are primary, story & setting secondary. Some contortions to avoid actual swear words, which was sweet but unrealistic. No sex or violence."}, {"userName": "Daria", "userReviewDate": "Jan 31, 2016", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/52167623-daria", "userReview": "This is another of my favorites books by this author. A quick, fun and witty read. I absolutely love Lisa Wingate\u2019s novels! I started with Tending Roses and have read and enjoyed each and every one of her books. I enjoy Lisa\u2019s writing style, character development, unique story lines and the fact that there is always personal growth, reconciliation and redemption in her novels. Lisa always finds an interesting premise, location or historical reference that leads me to do further research on the topic presented. I also like that her books are written in series which gives me an opportunity to get to know the characters better as the story lines develop and to see how they are progressing or what they are up to once they aren\u2019t the focal point of the current story. While I don\u2019t always like the personalities of the characters (I\u2019m sure that\u2019s Lisa\u2019s intent) at the onset, I do grow to love them and understand and appreciate their individual challenges and personalities as the story unfolds. I have sometimes felt uncomfortable as I was being taught lessons I needed to learn about how others might be challenged or struggling in their lives and the scenarios are realistic enough that you can certainly apply them to real life situations. At the end of the book, I am always loath to leave them and feel as if they are real people that I\u2019ve grown to know and care about. I have been inspired by Lisa\u2019s wisdom, challenged to become a better person, laughed, cried and fallen in love with the people and localities she writes about. I feel I am a better person for having read these books and always appreciate the measure of grace she brings to her writing. Each book leaves a great impression on me and my heart is full for a long time after the last page is turned. It is important to me that Lisa somehow manages to do all of this without feeling the need to use graphic language or sex scenes as I do not find that these add anything to a story.Don\u2019t think that her books aren\u2019t entertaining! Lisa adds wit to go along with the wisdom! There is always a little bit of romance, too!I hope you will take the time to pick up one of Lisa\u2019s books. You won\u2019t be disappointed."}, {"userName": "Barbara Lemere", "userReviewDate": "Apr 01, 2015", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/35287108-barbara-lemere", "userReview": "I just received this book and I am about seven chapters in and I love it! It jumps right in to the story, the pace is good, the characters are interesting, true to life, and fun.

So our heroine is off to Texas to investigate some missing dinosaur tracks on a ranch in Texas that specializes in \"Horse Psychology\",throw in some hometown characters hanging at the diner, a few long tall, cowboys, and huge Great Pyranees dog with a penchant for disaster and I am totally along for the ride!

Her books are easy reads, but do have substance to them. Often romance is involved, but no ridiculous or smutty story lines. Her writing is funny and light. Each series has books that are interconnected, but minimally. For me, it is nice to not read about the same characters over and over. Finally, I adore most of her books are set in Texas.
