I didn't enjoy the whole girl bonding moment over the fact that the men in their lives are those who taught them the skills that ultimately kept them alive. I find the whole I have 6 brothers or the my dad wanted a boy narrative to be very tired. These are two bad ass women who have survived due to their abilities and that scene just didn't do it for me. It wasn't as exciting as the other short stories and so it just wasn't as fun. I got it on kindle unlimited so it isn't a big loss. But she has written so much better."}, {"userName": "Mkittysamom", "userReviewDate": "Dec 31, 2015", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/9901011-mkittysamom", "userReview": "A very heartwarming Christmas tale with Katie and Jenni!!
