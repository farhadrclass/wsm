So as it's very subjective I don't rate the book I simply say why I laid it aside (and returned it to Audible).First, it was a little slow and \"chatty\". That in itself however wouldn't have caused my immediate, \"oh good grief\" and laying aside the book. Let us have something I've stated before clear... I HATE FRIENDLY OR CUTE OR ROMANTIC OR HELPFUL OR SPARKLY VAMPIRES. Am I clear on this? Fine. When she found the \"helpful vamp\" sitting by her hospital bed I hung it up...or put it down whichever you prefer. I did not finish the book. I don't plan to follow the series. For you who like to imagine romantic undead guys who are \"cute\"enjoy. Personally I fail to see how an animated corpse can be cute, romantic or sparkly but there you go. As I said enjoy. I'm more a \"vampires are monsters\" kind of guy.

She shouldn't be alive. Her heart stopped on the operating table. Then just as the doctor is about to call time of death, it starts beating again.

As a boundary witch, a witch who has power over life and death she has never received any training and the leader of the local coven wants to keep it that way. She's just too dangerous. But she will do anything to protect her niece, even enter into a partnership with the vampires, the vampires who want to see just how powerful she is. Such a great book.

Maybe it's because I listened to the audio? I don't know. Whatever the reason, I was never bored and I was genuinely interested in the story. Granted, it's really not the most exciting of books. It introduces the reader to the \"Old World\" of vampires and witches (there are werewolves too, just not in this book) but on a really mundane level, if that makes sense. We learn a little bit about the vampires, a little bit about witches and how their magic works. But there are still a lot of unanswered questions, specifically about Lex and her family. I kind of liked that slow burn. It made it really easy to listen to and follow, which is why I ultimately rounded up to 4 stars on my rating. HOWEVER, it was also a 3 star book for the same reason it was a 4 star for me: it lacked substance. We learn a little bit about this, a little bit about that, but there were quite a few things that were just given a cursory glance in this book. And there was nothing that made it really stand out in the already overcrowded UF market. There were no double take moments, no laugh out louds, no \"I can't believe that just happened!\"s. But even considering that, I think there may be a good series lurking under the surface of this one, just waiting to be exposed. It's just a feeling I have.If you are looking for an UF that feels a little more \"homey\" AND you have KU, I'd say why not try this one a shot. I'm definitely continuing with the next book.

I liked (a couple of) her books enough, but I end up picking at them. Boundary Crossed is set in the same world of Dead Spot, simply in an other city. Again I found plot and world-building interesting, but had a problem with some characters. Or facets of them. Lex could have been way more interesting, still it's a female character I can root for (even with some of the cliche). But Ms Olson made her a bit flat and a bit stupid. Flat for me because she realizes an entire world of Others is out there and it doesn't make in impact. WTH. A bit stupid as she rushes in to things without any planning or thoughts. I know a soldier isn't necessarily a tactician, but hey, ask before what the rules of engagement are. Shop around, rather than trust a single faction. Yes, I can understand some hectic choices, as a toddler life is on the line. Still. Unfortunately Lex isn't the only flat character, Quin is too. I guess he is supposed to be the Tragic Hero, it ends up simply boring and totally one dimensional to me. Plus, the romantic thread in this book sounds completely f* up (again to me). Unnecessary, unbelievable, completely lacking in chemistry. I watch those two and the only thing that comes into my mind is \"uh??\"There's not much of a romance, thank God, more of a hint. It still out of place IMHO. I realize it seems I didn't enjoy the book. Not at all. It's a nice UF, and above all it broke the slump I was in (where I have been re-reading some old romances for the last two month, unwilling to open up a new book. Don't ask me why. I don't know.) It simply never going to be a great UF, simply a nice one to pass the time.

A few mild *SPOILERS*I really enjoyed this book. I loved the character Lex. She is a former US Army Sergeant and a boundary witch. She has no idea she is a witch until she is attacked by a couple of vampires that are trying to kidnap her little niece. This attack led her to be in the hospital where she meets another witch and a vampire who start filling her in on what she is, of course blowing her away. She has to go and meet with the head vampire and make a deal to keep her niece safe as there will be more beings trying to kidnap her because she is a null. They explain to her that a null is someone that can drain power. Example: If a vamp is close to her, well carrying her since she's only one, they can actually walk in the sunlight, wolves wouldn't have to change on the full moon, etc. So with the help of some other witches they start training her on how to use her powers. She also has a great vampire friend she meets because of this named Quinn. He is a love interest, but that isn't really dwelled upon in this book. They have a few good battles and learn some really cool things. I think Lex is awesome. She has a menagerie of adopted animals, she's bad to the bone and she has a little snark and don't put up with much from anyone. She doesn't whine or go on about things, she just gets it done.

But of course I forgot about it, piled it up under so many to-read books. Until yesterday when on a whim (plus I was in my urban fantasy mood) I decided to finally pick this up. Well, Olson surely knew how to begin the first chapter, that's for sure...\nThe third time I died was early on a Monday morning, a week after Labor Day.\nHow could I NOT get intrigued??The story opened with quite a bang. Allison Alexandra Luther (call her \"Lex\" not Allie) was working her third shift in a convenience store when she encountered a couple trying to buy baby diapers... and found out that the baby was her own niece, Charlie. Realizing that the couple has kidnapped Charlie, Lex tried to stop them, even got stabbed for her attempt. She succeeded but it also opened her self to a whole new world. Apparently the couple was vampires who wanted Charlie because she was a null (human who nullifies the magic within a certain space around them) and Lex herself was a witch.For readers who read Scarlett Bernard would already be familiar with the null concept (Scarlet was a null herself). With additional witches and vampires, the world building was not exactly complicated. Having said that, Olson was still able to offer a new concept of witch: a boundary witch. I'm not going to spoil much, but it's a new type of witch with affinity for death essence ... and since Lex has only discovered her power, I can see her grown more ease and control over it. I seriously cannot wait to see more things that she can do with it. She already showed the potential of her power (one scene just creep the hell out of me) and I thought it would bring complications to her life, for sure.I definitely thought that Olson had improved her writing skill. She paced the plot really well, combining the action-thrill of the threat towards Charlie's life, Lex learning about her magic (with the help of two witches from Clan Peller), Lex finding out more about the Old World rules, Lex teaming out with Vampire Quinn to find out who was responsible for Charlie's kidnapping attempt, with a little touch of budding romance near the end. I liked that Olson kept that future romantic entanglement near the end because for me, Lex is not exactly at the place in her life to deal with it in the beginning. She still suffered from her time being out of the army, added with the death of her twin sister, Sam. Plus having a knowledge that she was a witch with dead blood was probably too much for one to take. I just hope that Olson doesn't fall to the trap of love-triangle for the next book though, since that what she did with Scarlet (despite the fact that I liked Scarlet's choice).There might be a hint of a cross-over plot, since one character's name from Scarlet Bernard series was mentioned here (Jesse Cruz, a.k.a. Scarlet's detective partner). I'm quite intrigued to see how that plays out. All in all, this is a really good start of a new series in a familiar universe. I already have book two with me, and I might gobble it up this weekend ..."}, {"userName": "Kathleen (QueenKatieMae)", "userReviewDate": "Apr 17, 2015", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/6713486-kathleen-queenkatiemae", "userReview": "THERE ARE GOOD WITCHES THERE ARE BAD WITCHESBUT MY FAVORITE ARE THE KICKASS WITCHES US Army Sargeant Allison \"Lex\" Luther was honorably discharged after almost dying in the field in Iraq.

A boring night at the Depot and a fortuitous incident changes everything in Lex\u2019s life. Everything.

That is mainly because of its strong lead character. Unlike the usual trope for this kind of books, the female lead character (Lex) isn't a wide-eyed teenager or a slightly older young woman with a bitter look on life. Lex is a 30 y.o. well adjusted and mainly happy except for a tragic episode in her recent past. And... gasp! She's not alone in the world either! She has a nice loving family that cares for her: father, mother (not divorced), a lot of cousins, a brother in law and a litte niece. Regarding her looks, Lex is not self-demeaning or extremely aware of her charms and thank all the deities she doesn't spend long paragraphs describing her appeareance or that of her love interest's.And that's other refreshing aspect that I enjoyed in this book. The romance isn't the center of the plot and our heroine doesn't spend long hours swooning for him. She's more focused in protecting her niece and she's well prepared to do so, even without magic: she's an ex soldier, an interesting past that isn't a sicological burden for her (she doesn't have PTSD), but it works very well in explaining her physical abilities.In other words, Lex's truly a regular woman living her life, when the supernatural falls all over her. She accepts it rather quickly to be believable, but if I wanted realism I wouldn't be reading a book about vampires and witches in the first place!The pace of the plot is quick, doesn't stall unnecesarily and is written in a style that can seem perhaps a little too simple (not overly detailed descriptions, for example) but that I think goes very well with the first person POV.Is this a masterpiece of literature? No. But I am a 30-something and I enjoy fantasy books, and it's inmensely gratifying to find one that seems targeted at me, not at teenage girls with a penchat for broody guys and impossible romances.

I liked the army vet leading lady, Lex, who discovers her magic along with the hidden Old World filled with witches, were's and vamps, when she foils her toddler niece's kidnapping. The story moves along well as Lex commits her services and her new magic to the local vamp boss in exchange for her niece's safety. There's the barest promise of romance for Lex with the vamp who is trying to help her find out who is behind the kidnapping attempts. He's a sympathetic character, and I liked him but I'm really an not wanting a relationship between them since he has two major strikes that go with his 'vamp-ness': he has no choice except to obey the vamp he's pledged to -which makes him someone who Lex really just can't rely on - and he finds her blood way too tempting.All in all I liked Boundary Crossed and am looking forward to more, though I'll probably hold out for the audio version next time - Olson's stories translate well to that format."}, {"userName": "Rob Blackwell", "userReviewDate": "Apr 29, 2015", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/6198965-rob-blackwell", "userReview": "\"The third time I died was early on a Monday morning, a week after Labor Day.\"So begins another terrific urban fantasy novel by Melissa Olson, whose Scarlett Bernard books I've also greatly enjoyed.

Generally, I liked the other series, I liked the world building and most of the characters, but I wasn't completely in love with the main character Scarlett and I despised the love triangle that went on through the whole series. If I'm correct, I should have read this the other way around (meaning I should have read this series first and Scarlett Bernard second), but I'm really glad I did it the way I did, because I enjoyed it much more this way.Speaking of Scarlett Bernard, I really loved the connection between the two series - at first, I didn't realize at all that one of Remus's victims was Lex's sister. Seeing how Boundary Crossed ended, we will probably see Jesse and Scarlett in the second installment.But let's get back to this book. Lex is not your ordinary UF heroine. She is a former soldier and a woman who loves her niece (daughter of her murdered sister Sam) and her herd of shelter pets. However, after ruining kidnapping attempt of her little niece, Lex finds out she is boundary witch and her niece Charlie is a null. I'm really wondering about where the boundary magic will lead us, although I'm really scared Lex will eventually kill someone, maybe even someone close to her. I'm not extremely environmental person, but I got really scared when Lex killed all those fish. And what's worse, giving a bunch of creatures gave her a pleasant high. I really hope this won't happen again, but if it does, I REALLY hope she won't accidentally kill any of her pets or friends. I would guess Lex will try to bring Sam back, but I guess it's not possible since her body was destroyed by Jesse and Scarlett. But maybe I will be surprised.Besides the creepy magic factor, this book had everything I liked - likeable main character that made choices I could understand (I really liked that for once, there was no unnecessary woman on woman hate, no hate between different races and no unnecessary angst), great side characters (I really, really like Quinn. In the reviews, some people said it annoyed them that he wasn't mean badass alpha and call me crazy, but after all the UF I've read, I like the change and I like that Quinn is approachable and level-headed and just mostly a nice guy.) and the fact that Lex has a lot of pets. I also liked the interactions between Simon and Quinn, which were very refreshing since usually we only get hate between vampires and witches.

Olson does a great job of capturing your attention in the first chapter, but I found my interest waning in chapter two. From there it plateaus into a flawed but easy read, allowing you to relax and enjoy the Benny Hill sketch that is Boundary Crossed complete with vampires, secret witches and whispers of werewolves.The character of Lex Luther has so much potential. Unfortunately, she fails to live up to her borrowed name. Olson could have told the story of a troubled character struggling to deal with the ghosts of her past as well as the vampires of her present. Instead, we read the tale of a woman who seems to be awfully well adjusted for having died three times and served two terms in the US Army.I expected a character who was still trying to hold her life together only to have it thrown back into chaos when her niece it kidnapped. Olson delivers on the chaos, but from the point of view of a character who barely reacts to being thrown into a car by a person she just met. It seems to me that that author was too caught up in writing a strong heroine that she failed to make the character feel whole.Unfortunately, Lex is not the only character who feels underdeveloped. The entire roster of supporting characters suffer a similar fate. Though, I must admit that supporting characters in a series may develop more over time. The main character, on the other hand, should have felt more complete from the start.But the book wasn't all bad; the fast paced plot is often fun and engaging, with few lulls, and there is a bit of romance that I suspect will progress further as the series continues. If you are looking for something fun and fast, this new series might just be right up your alley, but remember, don\u2019t look at the first installment with too much scrutiny, or you might be disappointed."}, {"userName": "A Voracious Reader (a.k.a.

However, the clue that I didn't note before pressing \"buy,\" was that this book involved someone named \"Lex.\" That nickname, to me, is almost always spelled N-O-P-E."}, {"userName": "AE", "userReviewDate": "Jun 07, 2015", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/26166014-ae", "userReview": "It wasn't until almost half way through that I realized this was the author of Dead Spots and that just explained a lot of my feelings on the matter. In that book, her concept was interesting but just didn't pan out for me. I just lost interest, when it was an interesting concept because it was a bland read--2 star, \"okay\" quality. I had no desire to ever read the next book, and I can't even remember the ending or the main plot line. And that's just not good. So regarding this book, I can tell you the following: This book started off with some interesting ideas, a character that could be quite kickass, but when I was sitting staring at the start of chapter 13, it came to a halt. I was confused at our MC's logic. Bored at the development. Uninterested in the drama. I mean, really, there is a dead sister in recent history and a toddler right now, but they feel like toys on a shelf, conveniently pulled down when needed for plot development. We have tons of characters being named and thrown out there, and I'm just like, omg, cull the masses. Less minor characters. I seriously offhand, I can list off 13 minors that are given names and introduced, not counting Quinn and our MC Lex. Furthermore, I know I'm only half way through here, but secondary characters could really help develop and flesh out Lex too. Maybe this changes by the end, but this is yet another book in a run of urban fantasy reads that is just not going well for me. I spent time on hunting a good book down. I avoided the cheesy PNRs and crappy series release #15, but yet, I am sitting on a good idea that has just boring characters! The plot is so one note, and it's not like she had to go crazy and add a bunch of other plots. She just needed to speed it up with tension! To compare:  Magic Bites  has a murdered loved one at the beginning and a plot to resolve the whodunit of the murder. It doesn't have a ton of subplot in first book. By half way there are over 2 encounters where blood is spilled, around 3-4 hostile meetings where violence could occur, and there is an escalation of dead bodies. Witty one liners, head way on the case, push backs on the case, introduction to seedy locations and characters that are memorable. In Boundary Crossed where is my escalation? My sense of wonder/dismay/awe at this magical underworld in Boulder? Why is this MC so trusting? Why are all these Urban Fantasy plots relying upon the female being uber trusting in situations where they wouldn't be?! Plot shouldn't move forward at the expense of your characterization. /:Gah, I don't want to finish this book. I'm shelving it.

I have a lot of books I could read but nothing I really felt like I was really just whole heartedly getting into. This book caught my eye. I loved the cover and didn't really read much of the Synopsis. I kinda like doing that, not really knowing what the book is about. Well.. Let me just say I'm glad I browsed that day for whatever was calling me. The beginning of this book, just pulls you in. It was fast paced and exciting. I really started to love the character Lex. A lot of times, I don't really like the characters at first. Till eventually they win me over. There's a lot about her and you learn overtime who she really is. I love that she has this humorous side, even though she is in total danger. That she would protect her family, whatever the cost. I'm a fan of Vampires and Witches. Sometimes though it's hard for me to find one that I love. It was not confusing and flowed magically, I guess you would say. About 51% in I realized that the second book doesn't come out till October! Wow.. I'll have to wait awhile. But that's alright :DThat.. Hmm how can I put this into words. This was the best paranormal series I've read this year so far. It was truly perfect. I loved the characters, but not just Lex. A whole bunch of them. Each of them brought so much to this story. I'm just beyond words right now. This is the first book I've read of Melissa's. I will most absolutely be reading more from her. Since, I have to wait till October. I'll have to read her other series. Thank you, Melissa for writing such an amazing story. If I could give this 100 stars I would. **Originally, I used Kindle Unlimited but purchased the book after. Totally worth it!! go get it**.......Lissahttp://www.boundlessbookreviews.comhttps://www.facebook.com/BBReviews"}, {"userName": "Angela", "userReviewDate": "May 13, 2015", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/4255477-angela", "userReview": "26 January 2016: $1.99 on Kindle13 August 2015: $1.99 on Kindle"}, {"userName": "Lorna", "userReviewDate": "Mar 15, 2017", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/10620039-lorna", "userReview": "(RabidReads.com) Story 4.25 stars. Narration 5 stars. When a book starts with \u201cThe third time I died was early on a Monday morning, a week after Labor Day,\u201d you can believe I was intrigued. I read and enjoyed Dead Spots by this author about three years ago, and for whatever reason, never went on with the series. I even have other books by this author in my tbr pile. When I saw all three books of this series on sale recently, I bought them in both e-reader form and audio form for a very reasonable price. I pretty much jumped right in and ended up very happy that I had bought them.Lex Luther(yep, that\u2019s correct)is working in a store, when a couple with a baby comes in for diapers. When she approaches them to help, she realizes that the baby they have is her niece. What follows is a fight for her niece, only these people have special abilities. Lex is ex-military and knows how to fight, but these creatures aren\u2019t human. What follows is a story about Lex and her introduction into the supernatural world she knew nothing about. Or that she has powers of her own. As she is adopted, along with her now deceased twin, no one knows her genetics or history. She\u2019s strong minded, and strong in body due to her military service, and has opened her home up to all kinds of rescued dogs and cats. She\u2019s a loner by choice, but her big, loving family really won\u2019t let her be alone. Along the way, she starts working with a vampire named, Quinn. Quinn used to be a policeman, but now works for the strongest vampire in the area(Colorado), which means that Lex is working for the vampire now also. I ended up really liking both of these characters. The jury is still out on the head vampire. A witch named Simon, also becomes important to the story, and actually was one of my favorite characters, besides the main two. Of course, there are more characters introduced and with the exception of the villains, I enjoyed those characters and look forward to seeing them in future installments.There\u2019s something to be said about a book that starts out so exciting. Non-stop action can pull me into a book very quickly, but if it doesn\u2019t stay well written and interesting, it can lose me fast. This book pulled me in and never let me go. I listened instead of read, so that made it even more fun, especially the action parts. There\u2019s plenty of back story told about Lex\u2019s life, especially when she was deployed in the Mid East in the past. The author has done a lot of world building about the supernatural world as well, always a good thing in an urban fantasy type read.Narration by Kate Rudd? I thought it was good and look forward to listening to the next books. I had never listened to her before and will be on the look out for more that she has narrated besides these.On purpose I am not going into what her supernatural talents are, or who the main vampire is. Or really what\u2019s going on with her niece(other than what the blurb says). I don\u2019t want to spoil this for readers. If you love urban fantasy, or even urban fantasy/paranormal romance than, this is perfect for you. At this point it\u2019s still almost young adult, although there is plenty of violence. As with any series, that rating could change as these characters are adult. At this point, I would recommend this to readers 15 plus. Very well written and highly recommended!"}], "description": "After her twin sister\u2019s brutal murder, former US Army Sergeant Allison \u201cLex\u201d Luther vowed to protect her niece, Charlie.
