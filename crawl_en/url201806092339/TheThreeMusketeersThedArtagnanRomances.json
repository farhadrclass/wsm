Many of its sequences--the Diamond Studs, Milady's seduction of Felton, the attempt of The Three to rescue Constance--move with remarkable rapidity. More notable than these, however, is the entire exposition, something many novelists have found to be a thankless chore, if not a stumbling block. It occupies a full sixty pages, 10% of the book, and, although it covers much ground--the introduction of our hero, the two principal villains, and all three Musketeers with their eccentricities and distinct characters, plus the fight with the Cardinal's Guards, the emergence of D'Artagnan as the \"fourth musketeer,\" and an examination of the curious relationship between King and Cardinal--it is constructed with such seamless grace, accomplishes its purposes with such a light touch, and moves so swiftly that the result is astonishing.Sir Walter Scott showed us that the personal is political, that our most particular, most intimate decisions are governed by the political milieu in which we are raised and the allegiances that our background requires. Dumas adopts the contrary principle, namely, that the political is personal: a siege may be lifted, a war started, because an English Duke loves a French Queen. It seems at times that all the characters of \"The Three Musketeers\"--even the King and the Cardinal, even that most gifted and ruthless of femme fatales, Milady--are satellites circling the binary star of Buckingham and l'Autriche, whose doomed love is the center of this impossible--and delightful--romantic universe."}, {"userName": "Madeline", "userReviewDate": "Jan 01, 2009", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/111921-madeline", "userReview": "I thought that Queen Margot couldn't be topped. I should have known better. Honestly, I do not have enough space to fully explain all the ways I adore this book. But I'll try to condense it. -First, the four main characters. Love, love, love, and more love. Aramis and Porthos - the Merry and Pippin of the group, if you'll excuse the extremely dorkish LOTR cross-reference - made me laugh; D'Artagnan was charming even though (or maybe because) he had multiple moments where, were I in the story, I wouldn't know whether to kiss him or smack him upside the head; and the pure unfiltered AWESOME that is Athos cannot be put into words. -My copy of the book is 754 pages, but I was able to finish it in less than two weeks and not even notice the length because the story was so engrossing. As soon as I finished it, I wanted to flip back to page 1 and start all over again. -Duels. Lots and lots of duels. -The only complaint I had regarding the other Dumas book I'd read before this (Queen Margot, as previously mentioned) was that there was a total lack of what I will bluntly call the dirty details. In Margot, all the sex scenes were kept out of the way and, judging by the description Dumas gave us of the characters' nighttime activities, no one managed to get laid for the entire book. The Three Musketeers, on the other hand, is by no means a bodice-ripper but is still very romantic. And then there's the scene where D'Artagnan decides that nailing Milady will be a good way to get revenge on her for kidnapping his girlfriend. Which brings me to my next point...-Milady. Holy crap. I try to come up with words to describe her, but I can't do it because my brain sort of slows down until all I can hear are the words \"Most. Badass. Character. Ever.\" repeating in my head over and over while the song \"Cold Hard Bitch\" by JET starts playing in the background. (if that makes any sense at all. Just go with it, okay?) But seriously, let's talk about Milady for a minute. She keeps poison in her ring, seduces a guard who has been specifically warned that she'll try to seduce him, stabs herself in the chest to make people think she killed herself, regularly tries to assassinate D'Artagnan and his friends, and was generally such a psychotic bitch that even Cardinal Richelieu was afraid of her.

I'm ashamed to say that I thought it was a children's book. My wife indignantly refuses any responsibility for my mistake... as she points out, it's entirely my fault if I drew the wrong inferences from the fact that her mother read it aloud to her as an eight year old. It turns out, on closer examination of the facts, that Elisabeth's mom must have skipped about a quarter of the text - but I digress. No, far from being a children's book, this is a noirish thriller, stuffed to the gills with violence, sex, nudity, dangerous blondes, corrupt politicians and random acts of mayhem and destruction. I should have known that. Anyway, better late than never.Quite apart from being a terrific read - I just couldn't put it down - Les Trois Mousquetaires is a remarkably interesting book for anyone who's fond of French literature. The merest glance at my French shelf will show you that I like both so-called serious novels and trash - as everyone knows, the French write the best trashy novels in the world. But what do these two literary traditions have to do with each other? I feel like a paleontologist who's discovered one of those missing links in the fossil record. A kind of literary coelocanth, it's exactly halfway between the two genres. Too well-written to be dismissed as trash, it still has so many of the defining characteristics of the modern French trash novel that it can't possibly be anything but a direct ancestor.I'd hate to give away any of the plot - there's a twist every other chapter - but let me explain in terms of generalities. Dumas is firmly in the great French tradition of Tragic Love. People in his world are divided into two classes: those who are motivated by Love and Honour, and those who want Money and Power. To be a superior person means belonging to the first group. Unfortunately, living only for Love and Honour isn't very practical, so these superior people generally have rather tragic lives; a theme you see over and over again in mainstream French literature. A particularly clear 20th century example is Belle du Seigneur. Ariane's husband is only interested in Money and Power, and his dreary monologues about his prospects of being promoted bore her to tears. Naturally, she's drawn to the dashing Solal, who never misses a chance to show how much he despises money (it helps that he's very rich). Equally naturally, it all ends up very tragically indeed. But let's get back to Les Trois Mousquetaires. Dumas takes real historical events, and reinterprets them through the prism of his ultra-romantic world-view. On his account, the political events of 1625-27 were all about a complicated tangle of love affairs. The beautiful Anne of Austria is Queen of France, but she has at best lukewarm feelings for her husband, the pathetic Louis XIII. Cardinal Richelieu, the true ruler of the country, has made advances towards her, but been rebuffed; he's eaten up by jealousy and spite, especially since he knows through his network of informers that Anne's heart in fact belongs to the handsome Lord Buckingham. To keep the story bubbling, Dumas invents some more people, who play key roles in this complicated game. One of Richelieu's main agents is the psychotic blonde temptress, Milady; her opposite number in the Queen's camp is the ambitious young swordsman, D'Artagnan. Needless to say, both of them are involved in their own intersecting webs of romantic intrigue.The startling thing to me is that the Dumas formula is still going strong, nearly 200 years later. The immeasurably popular SAS series, which you can buy at any French airport bookstall, is written to almost exactly the same specification. The central figure, Malko, is a modern D'Artagnan: vaguely on the side of the Good Guys, each episode sees him dispatched to a currently topical destination, where he's charged with some weighty task. For example, in Bagdad-ExpressMalko's assignment is to prevent the Iraq war by kidnapping Saddam Hussein. He and one of Saddam's sons (I think Qusay) get involved with the same woman, there's a lot of random sex and violence, and, of course, the deal falls through. A still clearer example is DjihadA Chechen rebel group gets hold of a Russian nuclear warhead, and they pass it on to an Islamicist faction led by a sexy blonde woman. (I know what you're going to say. In the SAS world, Islamicist factions can be led by sexy blondes). This time, after the usual toing and froing, Malko shoots down the blonde when she's just a few seconds away from detonating the bomb in New York. It's all remarkably similar to D'Artagnan's battle against the nefarious Milady.So what is it that makes this formula so incredibly effective? It's fun to see history rewritten so that politics and economics are less important than who's sleeping with whom. The camaraderie displayed by the Musketeers has become proverbial, and that's also inspiring. But, really, it's Milady who makes the book, and she's the character who's been copied most often in modern trash fiction. (Look at those girls on the covers of the SAS novels. Miladies, every one of them). Although D'Artagnan is a sympathetic hero, she effortlessly steals the show every time she appears, just as easily as Sharon Stone upstages Michael Douglas in Basic Instinct.What a shame Stone never got to play Milady in a serious adaptation of Les Trois Mousquetaires! Now that would have been worth watching."}, {"userName": "Agir(\u0622\u06af\u0650\u0631)", "userReviewDate": "Apr 24, 2015", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/30706760-agir",

"http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/1022982-brad", "userReview": "This is going to take some explaining, but my guiltiest pleasure when it comes to books is Alexandre Dumas' The Three Musketeers.I hear you saying, \"How on Earth can that be a guilty pleasure?\" I know. It's a recognized classic. It has far reaching pop culture impact.It's considered one of the greatest adventures ever written. It has two of the most memorable \"villains\" in literature; it has four kick ass action heroes. It has sword fights, romance, intrigue, and most people think it has big laughs (it doesn't, which is the thing that pisses me off most about its pop culture adaptations). Even if people haven't read the book they know the Three Musketeers. Hell, most people even know that D'Artagnan, the main \"hero\" of the book, is not one of the eponymous \"Three\". So how could this book be a guilty pleasure? The answer is simple at first, then its complex.Simple answer: Milady de Winter.Complex answer: Milady de Winter.From the accepted perspective, Milady is an unrepentant, nasty, evil, femme fatale. She is an agent for the \"villainous\" Cardinal Richelieu, spying on, plotting against and battling our Musketeers at every turn. She foments marital unrest between the King and Queen. She plots the assassination of the Englishman, the Duke of Buckingham, to stop him from aiding the Huguenots at La Rochelle. She tries to kill D'Artagnan and later poisons his mistress, Constance Bonacieux. She corrupts a fine, upstanding Puritan man. And once upon a time, she made a fool of the Comte de La F\u00e8re.She is the accepted villain, even worse than her master the Cardinal, for whom and under whose auspices she commits her evil acts. She is the villain, and D'Artagnan, Athos, Porthos and Aramis are the heroes. Here's the problem, though, from another perspective she isn't and they aren't.You see, Milady de Winter was a poor young woman who did what she must to survive. Forced into a convent for want of food, a priest fell in love with her and the pair stole some church property to start a life together. They were caught, and both were \"branded\" with the fleur-de-lys -- the mark of criminals. Alone again, she fell in love with the Comte de La F\u00e8re. They were married, and she hid her crimes from him. Then one afternoon the Comte discovered her brand. He felt betrayed and strung her up by her neck, leaving her to die.She lived and entered the service of the Cardinal. Under his direction, she became a powerful agent, doing exactly what it is that agents do. The Cardinal -- the right hand of the King, connected to the Pope, a man waging a war in the King's name, the most powerful man in France -- has Milady undermine the King's Queen, Anne of Austria, a woman having an affair with the man (Duke of Buckingham) who is helping the rebels within her husband's kingdom. She is also asked to keep tabs on a troublesome young guard, D'Artagnan, who seems to be thwarting the Cardinal's plans through sheer luck and Gascon audacity. She complies. Then the man she is spying on kills her lover, the Comte de Wardes. And if that isn't bad enough, the man she's spying on turns up in her bedchamber posing as the Comte and proceeds to \"make love\" to Milady. The \"lovemaking\" is so \"wonderful\" that D'Artagnan decides to come clean and reveal his true identity. Milady loses her temper -- with some cause, I think -- and tries to stab D'Artagnan (which he doesn't seem to understand). From then on, Milady wants vengeance against the murderer of her lover, who also happens to be her rapist (for that is what he is, surely?).Next, she is charged with assassinating the Duke of Buckingham, for which she is issued a carte blanche by the Cardinal, but her enemy, D'Artagnan -- committing treason against his own King and country -- warns the Duke, and she is banished to a tower while the Duke sails off to aid the Huguenots. Well, she isn't about to languish in prison, so she seduces a Puritan and makes her escape, winding up in a convent in France where she can hide out. Lucky for her, D'Artagnan's mistress, a married woman whom he was bedding while he was raping Milady, is also hiding out in the convent, so Milady de Winter takes the portion of vengeance at her disposal and kills D'Artagnan's lover as he killed hers.And for all of this, the Four Musketeers, now in possession of her carte blanche, hold their own little court, pass judgement on Milady and have her head separated from her shoulders. And they get away with it because they have the Cardinal's signature -- on Milady's carte blanche which allows the bearer to do whatever they do for the good of the kingdom.It seems to me that Alexandre Dumas knew that perspective would dictate how we saw his heroes and villains, and that he was okay with his muddied good and evil waters. He was writing from the Musketeers' perspective, and he knew that his readers would side with them against the Cardinal and Milady. But he also wrote in a way that complicated his Musketeers. So much so that we accept when D'Artagnan receives and accepts a commission to the Musketeers from the Cardinal himself. He wanted his characters to be grey, and they were. So why is this a guilty pleasure (especially if the guilt doesn't come from Dumas' writing)? I am finally getting there.The weight of popular culture has changed the way we see this story so thoroughly, has morphed the Musketeers so completely into righteous heroes, turned D'Artagnan into such a loveable heartthrob and his companions into the most likeable of heroes, that it is nearly impossible for people to see the things that make them grey.But I see them for who they are. I see the grey. So here comes the guilt: I see the Four Musketeers crimes -- treason, rape, murder, theft -- and all their flaws -- cruelty, greed, hypocrisy, entitlement, adulterousness (to name but a few) -- and I still love them. I love them, and I enjoy reading their adventures, and I cheer for them from beginning to end. I shouldn't, but I do, and that's why The Three Musketeers is my guiltiest of pleasures. So there. p.s. I love Milady de Winter too. For all the things she is."}, {"userName": "Luffy", "userReviewDate": "Mar 28, 2017", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/7407364-luffy", "userReview": "I'm not going to waste more time than necessary for this classic. The problem seems to come from me, since I couldn't follow a lot of the dialog. I couldn't make any sense of what transpired here, especially in the last third of the book.I liked the intrigue with the royal couple of LouisXIII and Anne d'Autruche. And as soon as these historical characters disappeared from the book did my enjoyment evaporate as well. Like I said, I don't want to dwell on this one starred book too much(one for all, and all for one).Having said that, I read the book in French and I think if I hadn't, if I'd read it in English I wouldn't have been able to finish the book. The French language was a novelty which kept me going. I simply cannot enjoy most classics. Now, to move onwards as soon as I'm able to."}, {"userName": "Sara", "userReviewDate": "Jan 23, 2015", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/5512657-sara", "userReview": "I am a drama addict. I admit it. I don\u2019t generally go for comedy. I will pick a movie that makes me cry over one that makes me laugh every time, and it is pretty much the same with my books. But when I do read something humorous, I love satire, wit, subtle humor. Mark Twain, Oscar Wilde or Will Rogers are my style. Imagine my surprise that Alexander Dumas has made me laugh aloud in The Three Musketeers. They are so over-the-top, while written as if he is endeavoring to take them seriously. I have long adored The Count of Monte Cristo, and so I have never thought of Monsieur Dumas as a humorist, but I have been sadly mistaken.Every time you think D\u2019Artagnan and company have landed themselves in an impossible situation, they miraculously find their way out. It is Don Quixote without any of the moral overtones. These men are heroic figures only in a comedic manner. Taken literally they would be abject cads. They are self-absorbed, misogynistic, and amoral, but it little matters since the world they inhabit is villainous and petty and corrupt. The King who is the head of the state is a buffoon, the Queen a philanderer, and the Cardinal, leader of the church, a man without ethics or morals. Any wonder that their men are less than stellar examples of knighthood? So, without any reason to admire anyone in this fictional world, we are able to enjoy the escapades of these men and even cheer them on toward their conquests of women, rivals, and the world of French politics. In fact, they are more often fighting other Frenchmen than the English, whom they profess to hate but for whom they seem to have great respect and admiration. I can imagine reading this in serialized form and waiting impatiently to find out what happens to Milady and the Musketeers. There are cliffhangers at almost every chapter ending and the pace is fast and furious. I felt somewhat like a kid again while reading this. I remember that joy in reading just for the thrill of the story...a sensation I don\u2019t always get with my reading these days."}, {"userName": "Bradley", "userReviewDate": "Mar 06, 2018", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/4213258-bradley", "userReview": "Most people know the story. At the very least, they know about the story or they can quote that famous line. I was one of those peeps. I had never bothered to read the book because I saw an adaptation or two. lolI'm so silly. So I finally read the book and it was better! Surprise, surprise, right? There's even MORE pathos, chivalry, swordplay, hails of bullets, swooning maidens, and truly an evil Cardinal and a nasty Milady to butt heads against. At first, I honestly thought the over-the-top preoccupation with honor and revenge was the brilliant prelude to a great satire, but it never lets up and there's never a punchline.So, no. It's just exciting and silly and crazy fluff. :) Yes. Fluff. Hell, the writing style is fast and could be as modern as they come, all the characters larger than life, the action and intrigue and plot points as funny as they are old-school. It makes for a very entertaining ride. :) There's absolutely nothing stuffy about this. And now I know why it's a classic. :) Classic popcorn fiction. :)"}, {"userName": "Michael Finocchiaro", "userReviewDate": "Sep 02, 2016", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/48483884-michael-finocchiaro", "userReview": "The initial tale where d'Artagnon as a relatively poor, relationless noble arriving in Paris and making friends with the legendary Porthos, Athos and Artemis and subsequently participating in a big adventure is one of the most exhilarating books of the 19th C in French literature. While not a children's book (due to the difficulty of the French text), the story itself is of course widely known and a favourite for story tellers (using abridged or illustrated versions) and for movie makers. My advice is to read this one and savour it but then continue on to 20 Year Later which is the sequel and is a fantastic story as well...not to mention the crowning achievement (IMHO) of Dumas, The Vicomte de Bragelonne. This first volume takes place during the reign of Louis XIII and does present a nice portrait of life during this time of relative stability in French history.This first volume is playful and light. Dumas uses this book to present four of his favorite protagonists: D'Artagnan, Portos, Athos, and Aramis (along with their comic-relief porters and so on) and the origins of their lifelong friendships. Happy father note: I was super proud when my 10-year old son grabbed my copy off the bookshelf and read it cover to cover. He then went on to the second book but kind of pooped out after 300 pages, understandable...This is one of my favorite French books but I would highly recommend reading the entire series - 20 Years Later, and the three Vicomte de Bragelonne books to get the full picture. Note that each book is set in a specific historical context:3 Musketeers: reign Louis XIII20 Years Later: Regence of Louis XIV and the FrondeVicomte de Bragelonne 1: Louis XIV early reign (conflict with Fouquet)Vicomte de Bragelonne 2/Louse de Valiere: reign of Louis XIV and romantic intrigues at courtVicomte de Bragelonne 3/Man in the Iron Mask: reign of Louis XIV and the fall of FouquetDespite adding some fictional elements (well, lots of fictional elements) and controversial interpretations (such as making the very real and still mysterious Man in the Iron Mask to be Louis XIV's twin brother Philippe for which there is zero historical evidence), the scenes, costumes, manners and overall atmosphere is painstakingly realistic for the periods in which these books are set. They are all extraordinary and among the works that Dumas put his own hand too (in other words, he relied less on ghost writers for this series than nearly any of his other books.)"}, {"userName": "Lisa", "userReviewDate": "Jun 23, 2007", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/149492-lisa", "userReview": "If I was a Physicist, I would explain it like this: Athos, Porthos and Aramis are like the protons in an atom.

This is the tale of D\u2019Artagnon, a young Gascon traveling to Paris to seek his fortune and finding the three Musketeers Athos, Porthos and Aramis upon his arrival.From then on, it is a swashbuckling adventure full of intrigues, sword fights, heartbreak and much more.The story has been adapted too many times to count them all, making the names of the Musketeers as immortal as those of their adversaries: cardinal Richelieu, count de Rochefort, Milady de Winter.Alexandre Dumas has written what I call a true classic. It is a pure satire about all layers of society from the ruling nobility and the Church to the poorest farmer.The author makes equal fun of what was supposedly honorable, how easily love was declared, how people were constantly in debt (the rich as much as the poor), about what useless and ridiculous topics clerics argued and philosophized, reasons for loyalty and so much more. There isn\u2019t a single topic Alexandre Dumas did not address. Therefore, you have to read this adventure story with more than just one grain of salt.However, considering the age of the tale, it is all the more remarkable how modern it is written. One very prominent example is the \u201eweak womenfolk\u201c, who nevertheless hold their own against the liars and cheaters that call themselves their lovers, husbands and sovereigns. The queen against the cardinal and king, Constance against her idiot of a husband and even D\u2019Artagnan to a certain degree, Milady against all of them.They all have suffered from great injustice and make their own fates.The queen, who is supposed to have such a blessed life but not only sits in a golden cage but is also beaten with a golden whip; Constance, who has the honor of serving the queen but is never taken seriously, only ever looked at as a plaything; Milady, who might not be a \u201enice\u201c person, but who spits social convention in the face anyway and does what she has to in order to survive and live well (OK, she really is the bad guy but a man doing the same would certainly not have been met with the same judgement).They stand opposite men like Athos, who hung his wife simply for a brand, not even listening to the story of how it was given (it was given justly, for sure, but at the time he didn't know that!) and who doesn\u2019t give the least bit of importance to an animal\u2019s life and likes to gamble things away that aren\u2019t even his; or D\u2019Artagnan, who likes to beat his valet and lackay and just wants to have fun and damn who gets hurt; or Porthos, who hops from bed to bed so long as his mistress pays his way; or Aramis, who pretends to be oh so devout, but sees in women nothing but a mirror with which to admire himself; or the king, who might not be the fool he often is portrayed as in the movies, but who is simply not very interested in matters of state (which is probably even worse); or the cardinal, who is actually not a bad statesman per se, but simply a typical Catholic (though just).We have the politics of the day nicely interwoven in this social critique. The Battle of La Rochelle, the ever changing loyalties of certain provinces and cities. These are but a few examples as there are many more people and aspects here. The people breathe life into an action-packed story of politics, religion, treachery, love, and friendship before a most intricately drawn background.Dumas has an impeccable writing style as well. I have to point out how ageless the story is, but the engaging, colorful writing style that so perfectly conveys the scorn and mockery of the ways of life portrayed here makes it a delight to read and doesn't give away the book's age at all.This was not the first time I\u2019ve read this book and I\u2019ve seen many adaptations, but it was the first time I listened to an audiobook version and the narrator did a great job linguistically (pronouncing the French terms correctly) as well as in conveying the sarcasm and ridicule."}, {"userName": "\u0645\u0635\u0637\u0641\u0649 \u0639\u0631\u0627\u0628\u0649", "userReviewDate": "Oct 17, 2017", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/64558762", "userReview": "\u0647\u064a \u0644\u064a\u0633\u062a \u0642\u0635\u0629 \u0645\u063a\u0627\u0645\u0631\u0627\u062a \u0639\u0627\u062f\u064a\u0629\u060c \u0647\u064a \u0642\u0635\u0629 \u0639\u0646 \u0623\u062e\u0644\u0627\u0642 \u0627\u0644\u0641\u0631\u0633\u0627\u0646 \u0630\u0627\u062a \u062e\u0644\u0641\u064a\u0629 \u062a\u0627\u0631\u064a\u062e\u064a\u0629 \u0647\u0627\u0645\u0629\u0623\u0644\u0643\u0633\u0646\u062f\u0631 \u062f\u064a\u0645\u0627\u0633 \u0623\u0641\u0636\u0644 \u0645\u0646 \u064a\u0645\u0632\u062c \u0641\u064a \u0623\u0639\u0645\u0627\u0644\u0647 \u0628\u064a\u0646 \u0627\u0644\u0648\u0627\u0642\u0639 \u0648 \u0627\u0644\u062e\u064a\u0627\u0644 \u0628\u0634\u0643\u0644 \u064a\u0635\u0639\u0628 \u0627\u0644\u062a\u0641\u0631\u064a\u0642 \u0628\u064a\u0646\u0647\u0645\u0627\u060c \u0641\u064a \u0639\u0645\u0644\u0647 \u0627\u0644\u062d\u0627\u0644\u064a \u064a\u0633\u062a\u0639\u0631\u0636 \u062f\u064a\u0645\u0627\u0633 \u062c\u0632\u0621 \u0647\u0627\u0645 \u0645\u0646 \u062a\u0627\u0631\u064a\u062e \u0641\u0631\u0646\u0633\u0627 \u0648 \u064a\u062a\u0646\u0627\u0648\u0644 \u0634\u062e\u0635\u064a\u0627\u062a \u062d\u0642\u064a\u0642\u064a\u0629\u060c \u0648 \u0625\u0646 \u0643\u0627\u0646\u062a \u0643\u062b\u064a\u0631 \u0645\u0646 \u0627\u0644\u0623\u062d\u062f\u0627\u062b \u0628\u0627\u0644\u0637\u0628\u0639 \u0645\u0646 \u0648\u062d\u064a \u062e\u064a\u0627\u0644\u0647 \u0644\u0643\u0646\u0647\u0627 \u0644\u0627 \u062a\u063a\u064a\u0631 \u0627\u0644\u062a\u0627\u0631\u064a\u062e \u0648 \u0644\u0627 \u062a\u0634\u0648\u0647\u0647\u0643\u062a\u0627\u0628 \u0631\u0627\u0626\u0639 \u064a\u0633\u062a\u062d\u0642 \u0627\u0644\u062a\u0648\u0627\u062c\u062f \u0641\u064a \u0642\u0627\u0626\u0645\u0629 \u0623\u0634\u0647\u0631 \u0627\u0644\u0623\u0639\u0645\u0627\u0644 \u0627\u0643\u0644\u0627\u0633\u064a\u0643\u064a\u0629 \u0639\u0628\u0631 \u0627\u0644\u0639\u0635\u0648\u0631"}, {"userName": "J.G.

I have been, on occasion, accused of some sort of self-set elitism which suffuses my opinions and critiques on literature. It seems people are often more likely to think one has an ulterior motive for liking or not liking a book rather than looking at the presented arguments. In any case, I would posit this book as the countermand to that sentencing. It is not a literary book, as such, as it does not place itself in a deep referential or metaphorical state. Though it is certainly influenced by many great works, it is, in its whole, no more nor less than the reigning king of the pulp adventures.Built on the ridiculous, the humorous, the exciting, and deeply in the characters, this work creates a world of romance (in that oh-so-classic sense) and adventure which conscripts the reader and delivers him to the front lines. I am alway amazed by this book's ability to invoke lust, pity, wonder, respect, scorn, and hatred, all while driving along a plot filled with new events and characters. Should there be any future for Fantasy, it lies not in the hands of Tolkien-copying machines, nor even in Moorecock's 'un-fantasy', but in whatever writer can capture  Beowulf,  The Aeneid,  The Three Musketeers, or  The White Company and make a world which is exciting not because everything is magical and strange, but because everything is entirely recognizable, but much stranger. Of course, one may want to avoid going  Mervyn Peake's route with this, and take a lesson from the driving plot and carefree frivolity that Dumas Pere and his innumerable ghostwriters adhered to.It is amusing here to note that Dumas has accredited to his name far more books than he is likely to have ever written. As he was paid for each book with his name on it, he made a sort of 'writing shop' where he would dictate plots, characters, or sometimes just titles to a series of hired writers and let them fill in the details.So, praises be to Dumas or whichever of his unrecognized hirees wrote such a work."}, {"userName": "Daniel", "userReviewDate": "Feb 13, 2009", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/4695-daniel", "userReview": "I've had more fun reading \"The Three Musketeers\" than I've had with any book in a long time, and my only regret is that I didn't find my way to Dumas sooner. It's bursting with swordplay, political intrigue, romance, fortunes won and lost, mistresses kept and stolen, poisoned wine, devious nobility, and vengeance sought and attained. What more could a reader ask for? While \"The Three Musketeers\" isn't the most intellectually challenging book ever written -- though it does offer, in passing, the occasional insight into the human race -- it might be the best guilty-pleasure book of all time. And while it's long for such a book at 650-plus pages, not a word is wasted.Is there a more intriguing villainess in literature than Milady? A more fascinating hate-him-one-moment, forgive-him-the-next character than Cardinal Richelieu? And that's not to ignore d'Artagnan, who, with a youthful foolhardiness and energy that eventually gives way to gravitas, only the hardest hearted of readers could not love. And while Porthos, Aramis and Athos may spend most of the book as flat characters -- and I'm using that term the same way E.M. Forster does, not as an insult but to distinguish them from multifaceted, \"round\" characters -- they each have their more complex moments, Athos especially.I do have one minor complaint about \"The Three Musketeers.\" While the long section detailing Milady's imprisonment by her brother-in-law is a fine story on its own, it does tend to drag on too long in the context of the \"The Three Musketeers,\" mostly because it causes readers to spend too much time away from the Musketeers themselves. And while Milady's corruption of Felton does have its interests, we as readers don't spend enough time with him ahead of it to really feel as bad as we should.But this is a minor quibble. As should be obvious by my five stars, which I give unreservedly, I really did love the book on the whole. And, on a side note, I like that \"The Three Musketeers\" concludes with a brief what-happened-to-each-character section, something Dumas did long before the film \"Animal House\" or Van Halen's \"Hot for Teacher\" video. (And this, by the way, may mark a rare time Van Halen and Dumas are mentioned in the same sentence.

I was much more into the second half, when it starts focusing on the diabolical Lady de Winter. One disappointment was that I had always envisioned the Three Musketeers to be noble, just, Robin Hood-type characters. It turns out that, though brave, they are quite selfish and immoral, and tend to murder people with little provocation. None of the musketeers was very likable to me. Women also don't fare very well here and are talked about in quite unsettling terms. Dumas definitely has a gift for dialogue, though, and it's hard not to be sucked into his world of intrigue and passion."}, {"userName": "Piyangie", "userReviewDate": "Dec 28, 2017", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/48056505-piyangie", "userReview": "I'm bit at a loss as to how to review this book. I'm burdened with mixed feelings, and both these positive and negative views compete with each other in their importance and priority threatening my ability to write a coherent review. I can only try, for I need to pen my thoughts; I desperately need it out. I will not venture to state the story or any part of it, for there cannot be many who have not read it, or if not, have watched a movie adaptation. I will only express what I felt for the story, the characters, and writing. First I'll begin with the writing. This is Dumas's forte. The exhibition of wit and humour coupled with his ability to create an intriguing tale, keeping the reader in suspense as to what would unfold, is amazing. Over and over he has displayed his mastery in writing, making him one of the wide read and popular French Classicists. Here too was no exception. There was wit, humour and intrigue which held the reader\u2019s attention and interest. The story is a mixture of fiction with an actual historical account of the events that unfolded in the court of Louise XIII of France, and England, focusing on George Villiers, 1st Duke of Buckingham, at the time of siege la Rochelle. The roles played by France and England in this siege, and the power struggle between these two great enemies (at the time) divided by religion is well portrayed. This allowed the reader to gain a good insight as to the history while enjoying the fictitious story. All these inclusions made the book an interesting read, and a quick page turner. Now to the characters, and this is where I fell out a little with the book. However, to do justice to Dumas, I will admit that though some characters had been presented with favour, others have been presented neutrally, letting the readers be their judges. The favoured characters, as anybody would guess, are the Three Musketeers - Athos, Pothos, Aramis, and the young Gascon hero, D'Artagnen. While I accepted D'Artagnen for most of the part in the favourable light in which he was portrayed, I couldn't do the same for the three Musketeers. If Cardinal Richelieu, Comte de Rochefort and cardinal's guards were bad, the actions of the defending King's musketeers were equally bad. Though the author tried his best to justify them, he utterly failed before my tribunal. The only favoured character that Dumas and I could fully agree on was Madame Bonacieux, the truly loyal servant of the persecuted Anne of Austria, the Queen of France. However, surprisingly my interest was piqued and held by those characters Dumas has portrayed neutrally. Cardinal Richelieu is one. Though I wouldn't for life of me sanction his actions and his persecution towards the Queen, he was not despicable as I expected him to be. My Lady De Winter is another story. She is a novelty in the history of classics. A heartless, vengeful woman with an evil disposition, she was the only character I found who roused my emotions. If I may say so, I despised her with passion and didn't feel any remorse at her tragic death. The conflict between negative and positive feelings however, didn't diminish my enjoyment of the book. Keeping my personal perceptions at bay, I truly enjoyed it. Now the big question is whether I would read Twenty Years After and The Vicomte de Bragelonne - the two successive sequels? For the time being, the answer is probably not. I'm not enamoured enough with the Musketeers to indulge myself immediately with the sequels. I have read the synopsis of the two and feel I might be able to enjoy the actual historical account which is delicately entwined with the fictitious story. But when may I lay my hands on them is a question the future will answer."}, {"userName": "Jo (A rather Bookish Geek )\u2764\ufe0f", "userReviewDate": "Aug 22, 2017", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/28323108-jo-a-rather-bookish-geek", "userReview": "It has took me longer than usual to get through this book, but hell, there are so many amazing books to be devoured!

The rather serious philosophical questions Robert Louis Stevenson posed about mind-body duality and evolution are passed over in favor of the monster story of wicked Mr. Hyde. Jonathan Swift\u2019s venomous satires of English life are reduced to the tale of an island of little people and an island of giants.And even as I knew this, I steadfastly avoided reading the works of Alexandre Dumas pere, considering his most well known work, The Three Musketeers, as nothing more than an early proto-swashbuckling Saturday matinee serial. Plus, there was the length consideration. Dumas wrote by the line and it shows, at least in the heft of any one particular volume of his work. A typical Dumas can make Dostoyevsky look like a Reader\u2019s Digest Condensed Novel. And who wants to sit through a long, long, loooonnnng children\u2019s adventure tale?Well, as it turns out, I do. Or rather, I don\u2019t.Because Dumas, while he\u2019s fun, breathtaking, ludicrous, exciting \u2014 in short, all the things too often lacking in \u201cserious fiction\u201d \u2014 is anything but a kid\u2019s writer. True, even though there exist children\u2019s versions of his novels with all the alluded to naughty bits excised (or even unexpurgated texts marketed at children); true, even if he is widely considered by many scholars as no more than a hack penny a line scribbler who worked with collaborators like an assembly line, incapable of serious literary quality fiction.The basics of the plot are relatively well known: young hot-headed D\u2019Artagnan meets with and challenges each of the Three Musketeers, Athos, Porthos, and Aramis; the three, impressed by his bravery and quick-thinking, take him under their wing; meanwhile, the Queen of France, engaged in a never-consummated affair with the Duke of Buckingham, is under the watchful eye of Cardinal Richelieu and his spies; most formidable of his spies are a team made up of a shadowy figure referred to only as the Mysterious One and Milady; and through various means and machinations, our four heroes are drawn into a contest against Richelieu on the side of the Queen.Now, over time, the term \u201cMusketeer\u201d has obtained some gloss of nobility, chivalry, and honor, having become stripped of its mere military title aspect. It is as if a book written over a hundred years ago entitled The Three Corporals had elevated that rank to nobility. We clearly discover throughout the book that most of the musketeers are bullies and ruffians, even our heroes are not without their bad points. Still more curious about this name is that most of these men are swordsmen, who don\u2019t seem to ever partake of any \u201cmuskets\u201d or the like. It is a rare moment when our heroes come into contact with gunpowder.None of which matters, because we are quickly drawn under Dumas\u2019 spell. His characters are all distinctly drawn, Aramis with his holy orders and quiet philosophy, Athos with his distinguished paternalism and deep sorrow, and Porthos with his loud and brash manner and his vanity. Likewise the enemies they are up against, the smoothly evil and calculating Richelieu; the seductive, brilliant hellcat that is Milady, a stronger female in literature nowhere to be found; and the dangerous Comte de Rochefort, a shadowy presence of malevolence.It becomes clear rather quickly too that Dumas had an extraordinary gift for the cliffhanger style and the miraculous escape, double-crosses and triple-crosses filling out the bill all the way. Mistaken identities and figures hidden in cloaks and masks populate the novel in every shadow, every corner, and every darkened hallway. Intrigues always just out of arm\u2019s length draw both the characters and the readers along deeper and deeper into court secrets and competing factionalism.Probably no greater advertising for the Machiavellian schemes of Cardinal Richelieu ever existed or was more broadly bruited about than this novel. At every turn, at the moment when the Musketeers or their allies think that they may have gotten the best of the Cardinal, like an octopus, his tentacles are everywhere at once, grasping at every likelihood. His agents are in every corner of the country, his name whispered fearfully by every innkeeper and tavern wench, the King in his pocket. He is almost evenly matched by his agent Milady, more cunning than a snake. The scenes in which she seduces her jailer Felton are some of the most exciting and suspenseful in the novel, and next to nothing happens in every one.Thus it is that the author must manage pretty fast footwork for his heroes if they are to have any hope of outwitting the Cardinal. Dumas\u2019 plots hinge on that accepted notion of coincidence writ large across the story where evil designs are overheard in casual conversations, where a figure sighted in the distance just happens to be who D\u2019Artagnan wants it to be, where every twist of the story fits neatly into every other. Novels are no longer written with this tailored manner and it\u2019s easy to see how too many of them could eventually become stylistically clich\u00e9d. Taken every so often, Dumas\u2019 novels, though, are a cure for what ails you when the reading doldrums strike and every book selected seems tedious and vague.Yet all of this sounds distinctly like good fun for younger readers. And it is. That\u2019s the strange magic of it. At no point while reading The Three Musketeers does anything happen that isn\u2019t entirely kid acceptable while there is much here for adults. Even the scene in which D\u2019Artagnan seduces Milady is done in such delicate style that it achieves its goal of sophistication and sultriness without dropping overt hints, the kind prevalent in any PG rated film these days. And at no point while reading The Three Musketeers do you, as an adult, feel like the book is talking down to you or cheating you in any way, all the while you\u2019re having a grand time.Which is the strange magic of Dumas. A six hundred page novel passes in barely the time it takes shorter books to lose your attention near the middle. The cliffhanger style chapter endings pull you along ever deeper into the book. Even though I was listening to an audiobook most of the time, I had to pull down a copy off my shelf, never before cracked open, and read ahead after hours. It even lit a fire under me to read and listen to more Dumas, propelling me to the next book, the nearly twice as long Count of Monte Cristo. Happy adventuring awaits should you follow this path."}, {"userName": "Victoria", "userReviewDate": "Jan 08, 2016", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/23098891-victoria", "userReview": "4,5/5Une tr\u00e8s bonne lecture !

Huh.It seems almost silly to give much of a plot summary of The Three Musketeers. Everyone knows the story, right? Athos, Porthos, and Aramis are the eponymous black sheep within the musketeers: the ones who don\u2019t play by the rules but nevertheless still hold to the ancient rites of honour. D\u2019Artagnan is a young Gascon man eager to make his name by joining the musketeers, and he quickly befriends the Three and joins them on many adventures. Together they fight the machinations of Cardinal Richelieu and his minion, the irredeemable Milady de Winter.Except, it\u2019s a lot more complicated than that.Alexandre Dumas\u2019 story is one that has become so popular, been adapted so many times, that its original narrative has become snarled and twisted and confused in public consciousness. Having now read the book, I can see why: this is a massive novel that plods on and on in a series of interrelated episodic adventures that can be repetitive at times. It\u2019s not difficult to understand why the various writers of adaptations have streamlined and simplified the story for television and movies. In so doing, they have associated the three (or four) musketeers with the ideas of heroism, courage, and bravery. Also, they have a chocolate bar named after them. How many literary characters can say that?Most of the adaptations manage to portray the heroes with flaws as well as virtues: they capture the carousing, the drinking, the gambling\u2014oh, and the irrepressible urge to duel. But they elide over some of the most memorable moments. For instance, the musketeers\u2019 four respective manservants play crucial roles in the books, almost as important as the musketeers themselves\u2014and, for the most part, the musketeers treat them like shit. Athos doesn\u2019t let his speak, and Dumas goes out of his way to describe how d\u2019Artagnan forbidding his servant to quit his service actually endears his servant to him more\u2026. Meanwhile, a lot of the problems in the book are the result of the musketeers drinking and/or gambling too much. They tend to pick fights where none are necessary. Then they go running to hide behind Captain de Tr\u00e9ville\u2019s skirts, using their special friendship with him to get out of trouble. When they need more money, they chat up bored wives for loans.So the musketeers aren\u2019t the shining heroes we have made them out to be in popular culture. They are, to Dumas\u2019 credit, much greyer and more morally complex than that. The same can be said for Cardinal Richelieu and Milady. Although it\u2019s easy to mistake this book for a florid romance set two centuries before it was written, it is a far richer story of how personal whims and ambitions and relationships affect the political tapestry of a continent like Europe. For his love of Queen Anne, Buckingham betrays his nation. D\u2019Artagnan finds himself set against Richelieu not necessarily because they are so different but because Richelieu\u2019s methods conflict with d\u2019Artagnan\u2019s sensibilities.One thing that surprises me in the novel is the very fair treatment that Dumas gives Richelieu. He is not a one-dimensional, transparent villain. It\u2019s clear that Richelieu is acting for what he believes is the good of France. This is a perilous time for the kingdom, which has remained staunchly Catholic in the face of rising Protestantism, and has managed to alienate even the other Catholic countries in Europe\u2014namely, Spain. Richelieu is legitimately worried about alliances between these countries and invasion or rebellion, and his scheming is, ultimately, an attempt to make sure that France is prepared. Peter Capaldi captures a sliver of this side of the character in the BBC adaptation, but his Richelieu is also a more personally self-absorbed character.I wonder if Dumas was secretly fascinated by seventeenth-century France, so much so that he ached to write a political thriller about the events therein, only he knew that it would sell better if he couched it in the contemporary ideas of the romance. By our standards he is incredibly sexist\u2014women are, to Dumas, the fairer and weaker sex, and indeed, part of Milady\u2019s villainy is her presumption to \u201crise above\u201d the proper stations of motherhood and companionship as a woman and seek a man\u2019s destiny in life. (He also has this weird obsession with women\u2019s hands.) But for his time, Dumas might have been perceived as fairly liberal, for a male writer, in his depictions of women characters.That\u2019s not saying much, of course. It\u2019s sufficient that Dumas\u2019 women have more agency than fenceposts. There are basically three important female characters (I\u2019m not counting Kitty): Anne, Constance Bonacieux, and Milady. Although Dumas\u2019 portrayals of them are far from faultless, he nevertheless manages to capture the dangerous and difficult nature of being a woman in seventeenth century France. He shows the empty court life that Queen Anne must lead, the emotional gulf that separates her from her husband and leads her to seek love in an English ambassador. And, oh, did this book make me love Constance even more than I did in the BBC version. In the latter, she is merely d\u2019Artagnan\u2019s landlady rather than the queen\u2019s seamstress. But this additional dimension in the original text makes her character much more interesting. She and Anne are both victims of the oppressive, patriarchal nature of the time. They lack the power to do much about their situations, and they ceaselessly exercise the little power they do have to make their lives better, only for men to swat them down again if it\u2019s inconvenient.But it\u2019s in the portrayal of Milady de Winter that Dumas truly excels at a nuanced portrait of women\u2019s struggles. As I note above, there are very problematic aspects to Milady\u2019s use of her sexuality to get what she wants, and the ending of the book seems to say that Dumas is punishing her for having the gall to act, essentially, the same as the musketeers do. She is the Cardinal\u2019s agent in the same way that the musketeers are the king\u2019s/queen\u2019s/whatever. In fact, it\u2019s arguable that Milady has a more legitimate claim to being a loyal French agent than the musketeers. Richelieu sends her to assassinate Buckingham\u2014who, let us not forget, is English\u2014because it would prevent the launch of an invasion fleet. That kind of seems like a good thing to do if one is concerned for French sovereignty, no? But the musketeers rush to stop her, and then condemn her for engineering Buckingham\u2019s death, despite the fact that he is clearly an enemy of state and she totally had the Cardinal\u2019s permission. Who is the wrong now, hmm?Indeed, there is a delightfully subversive edge to this, the major plot of The Three Musketeers. For a long time prior to achieving her goals, Milady is imprisoned in a castle in the English countryside. She laments the fact that, as a woman, she is unable to merely fight her way free and escape through physical feats. Instead she must resort, as always, to her beauty and wiles. And my interpretation of this is not that Dumas is painting Milady as a sociopathic viper but as an unfortunate, psychologically scarred woman who has to do a lot of unsavoury things in order to survive. She is aware of how her gender has affected her life, has made things harder, and she has been forced to hone whatever few weapons she could forge from her disadvantages. So even though there is something fairly unfortunate in how Dumas portrays Milady\u2019s vituperative scheming against d\u2019Artagnan and her consequent fate, I also think that she is a far more complex character than she might seem at first glance.These layers, then, are what result in the wonderful and transcendent quality of The Three Musketeers. On one level it is a straightforward romance, a tale of swashbuckling heroes against scheming villains. It has swordfights and chase scenes and all the melodrama that anyone could want\u2014and I love it for that reason, far more than I suspected I would. On another level, it depicts the difficult life of musketeers in seventeenth-century France. The four musketeers are complicated and flawed characters who make mistakes and essentially function as vigilantes. Dumas captures the tense political situation in Europe at the time. And onto that additional level, he overlays the ambitions and relationships of individuals\u2014both men and women\u2014depicting how these alter and affect the fates of nations. The Three Musketers is an adventure novel, yes, but it should never be dismissed merely as that. It is nothing short of an amazing and impressive work of literature that deserves its status as a classic."}, {"userName": "Paula W", "userReviewDate": "Dec 29, 2016", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/13286533-paula-w", "userReview": "Although not as epic and awesome as The Count of Monte Cristo, I fully realize that nothing could be as epic and awesome as The Count.
