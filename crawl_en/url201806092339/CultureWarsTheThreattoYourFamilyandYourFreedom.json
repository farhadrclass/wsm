It\u2019s a game; can I find something I do agree with? Most often I do. In talking about religious leaders, Castle drops into the realm of name-calling and snarky sarcasm making \u201cCulture Wars\u201d nothing more than a fist-pump for atheists. In spite of that, I played the game and found things I can agree with, but first let\u2019s deal with the nonsense.Castle talks glowingly about atheism as science based, and religion derogatorily as faith based. In some areas, science is unarguable; pure water at sea level boils at 100\u00ba C. In other areas, science creates theories to explain concepts; the Universe began with a big bang. The origin of the Universe is still being studied and refined with the possibility a whole new idea will emerge. Pure science encourages this. One should not confuse boiling water science (law) with origin of the Universe science (theory). Here are examples of how Castle confuses science, or abandons it entirely to make her points.Example one \u2013 The science of human life and the atheist leap of faith: A human egg fertilized by a human sperm is a human being; that\u2019s the science. From conception to death, it will go through different stages, such as; fetus, infant, toddler, teenager, adult, middle age, old age, etc. Castle says the fertilized egg is not entitled to human rights until it lives long enough to achieve a stage she calls personhood. Personhood is not scientifically testable \u2013 it is a counter science construct she uses to justify abortion \u2013 not unlike the faith based construct of a soul of which she is so critical.Example two \u2013 The science of evolution as boiling water: Evolution theory is based upon naturally occurring deviations in DNA molecules. Deviations that provide an advantage are carried forward. Thus, survival of the fittest explains the variety of life. There is fossil evidence which supports the theory, but it is full of holes, starting with the overwhelming probability against a DNA molecule forming randomly. There are mitigating theories. Ribosomes, building blocks of RNA, could theoretically be assembled using catalytic actions, and then RNA might form DNA, but science hasn\u2019t been able to verify the viability of this step. Even if a more ordered molecule did appear, new random changes are likely to destroy it or knock it down a notch. This brings the probability of random DNA back down. Let\u2019s say, against the odds, we find ourselves staring at a shiny new DNA molecule laid out on a primordial rock. How are we going to make it live? Let\u2019s say lightning strikes and it dances off, alive! Is natural selection now going fill the planet with millions of species of life? First tell me how the eye developed \u2013 certainly an eyeless hydra didn\u2019t birth a bouncing baby hydra with a functioning eye. Per the theory, hundreds or thousands of tiny advances must accumulate. We start with a light sensitive cell, then, down the line, the cell gets a nerve to connect it to a central processing center where another series of mutations, perhaps thousands building on one another, results in a developed eye. In what universe does the existence of an isolated light-sensitive cell in an organism improve the organism\u2019s chance for survival? Evolution is filled with holes where development must travel through a series of useless steps before increased survival probability is achieved. Science may succeed in the endeavor to answer the question of life and diversity, but for now, the science of evolution provides an interesting and convincing theory about life, but is far from being a scientific law. I believe the theory of evolution should be taught in school, but as a theory with all its weaknesses and not as the only explanation for life on Earth. Religious teachings about creation no not belong in public schools. Intelligent design? I don\u2019t know enough about it.Example three \u2013 Science as political/religious tool \u2013 climate change:In ancient history, religions taught that Earth was the center of the Universe. Astrologists noticed planets and stars moved in ways that contradicted the religious model. In 150 A.D Claudius Ptolemaes (Ptolemy) published the Almagest using mathematical simulations to support the religious conclusions. Ptolemy\u2019s model became the consensus. In the early 1600\u2019s Galileo challenged Ptolemy\u2019s consensus system using data from his telescope. Galileo was brought before the Catholic inquisition where he was sentenced to house arrest for the rest of his life.We thought we had come a long way since the days of Galileo, but now we hear from Climate Change advocates that scientists who question the consensus are \"idiots\" (Barack Obama) and should pay \u201ca political and social price,\u201d (Al Gore). Climate Change advocates\u2019 assertion that the debate is over confuses scientific theory with scientific law. When have true scientists stopped experimenting, and refining, and questioning concepts and theories because there is a consensus? The consensus should always be and generally is challenged as we expand scientific knowledge. Why is that not acceptable with Climate Change theory? In a book review like this, there is no space to detail the statistical fallacies, disappearing data, pressure on scientific publications, collusion to massage the mathematical models, FOIA lawsuits to keep the data and models secrete, and more that are part of Climate Change theory. Progressives thrive on big government \u2013 it is their reason to exist. The power and size of government required to control Climate Change are opiates to progressives. Climate Change is to progressives what Ptolemy was to the Catholic Church. That is why those who question the, so called, consensus need to be silenced. (Note: Any time a religion or a political organization wants to punish people who question a \u201cscientific\u201d principal \u2013 LOOK OUT!)Example four \u2013 Science; a healing force opposed to faith: Castle says science provides the \u201ctested\u201d and proven treatments for injury and illness while faith tricks people into abandoning tried and true cures. Castle ignores science when science proclaims faith is a powerful healing force. This is demonstrated by medical researchers\u2019 use of placebos and double-blind procedures to account for the impact faith has in healing. It doesn\u2019t seem to matter if the faith is in god, a benevolent universe, the treatment, etc. so long as faith exists. Science should not reject faith and faith should not reject science.The claim that atheists are somehow better than theists because atheists are grounded in solid science is specious at best. Atheists certainly hold science on very high pedestal as long as it supports their belief systems, but they are quick to throw it under the bus or misuse it when needed.So back to the book. I already believe in most of the social issues Castle cares about \u2013 I don\u2019t need atheism for that. I also believe the tax-exempt status for religions is overbroad and abusive. The one issue Castle brought up that caused me to think is the national motto, \u201cIn God We Trust.\u201d When I was in grade school, the motto was \u201cE Pluribus Unum\u201d meaning \u201cout of many, one.\u201d Before \u201cCulture Wars\u201d I hadn\u2019t given thought to the change. I agree with Castle; the original motto is an unambiguous statement of unity. Given the situation in the country today, the new motto is divisive.If you are an atheist and you want to feel you are better than theists, this is the book for you. Otherwise, it may be a waste of time and money. I am giving it three stars, though, honestly, I can\u2019t justify it. It\u2019s just a feeling, and I\u2019m going with that \u2013 OMG! Am I a Liberal?"}, {"userName": "Diana Brown", "userReviewDate": "Apr 11, 2017", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/58887111-diana-brown", "userReview": "Potentially good points lost in a rambling, denigrating rantThe author is far too busy venting her hostility to the Catholic church (which she was apparently raised in, as she refers to attending Catholic schools) to spend much time making her actual points, and the reader quickly tires of attempting to dig them out of the mire.A shame, as she seems to have some valid points to make."}], "description": "Boldly stated and passionately supported, this argument against religious influence on the American government and legal system analyzes the impact that religion has on culture in the United States. The book makes the claim that many laws based on religious beliefs, specifically theology promoted in the Middle Ages, are misattributed as long-standing social values and that changing the theology itself threatens the religious institution supporting it\u2014igniting a cultural war engulfed in fear and resulting in political dysfunction. It reveals that from sexuality to family planning and the tax system, religious doctrines permeate and direct American life without accounting for the differing views of individuals, and in response, the author provides strategies for overcoming the imposition of external religious views and demonstrates the value in standing up for a secular nation where morality is not tied to one particular religious group.", "title": "Culture Wars: The Threat to Your Family and Your Freedom", "url": "http://www.goodreads.com/book/show/16056693-culture-wars", "average": 4.0, "cover": "https://images.gr-assets.com/books/1349155759l/16056693.jpg", "reviews": 2, "authors": [{"url": "https://www.goodreads.com/author/show/6544236.Marie_Alena_Castle", "name": "Marie Alena Castle"}], "type": [], "outlinks": ["http://www.goodreads.com/book/show/16056693-culture-wars", "http://www.goodreads.com/book/show/25712678-culture-wars"]}
