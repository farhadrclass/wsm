I loved her first cookbook and hoped for more of the same.Maisy got in the action too..after she arranged the couch and got comfy.\nThere are several recipes I'm interested in trying..this apple,walnut and blue cheese salad has me all over it.\nThe pictures in the book are great as always but this book to me just didn't hold a candle to her first one. It just seems like she has gone more commercial now. I want that spice back Lisa Fain!! I'll still grab up anything she writes though..just cuz.\nMy butt just put on a pound from looking at that frito salad.

Featuring sweet, spicy, and savory recipes, there's bound to be something for everyone tucked away in this collection.The first thing that sticks out to me in this book is the pictures. The photography is really well done, and it made me hungry just flipping through it. If that's not a sign of a good cookbook, than I don't know what is. The beginning of this book also features an introduction to Texan food, a guide to peppers, and what tools of the trade are best to have on hand while making these dishes. Not being from Texas (though I have visited and I loved it), this was really helpful.The recipes are sorted according to course, making it easy to navigate and construct a Texan meal from salad to dessert. The fact that each recipe comes with a personal story about family or friends of the author gives every single plate a really homey quality to it. It really does feel like you have a trusty Texan family member guiding you through your cooking. It's a nice touch.There are way more recipes in this book that I'd love to try than not, although I have to admit the amount of peppers used in this book is really high. I know that it's Texan, but as someone who wants only a skosh of peppers, if that, it stuck out to me a lot. My girlfriend's dad is essentially allergic to flavor (he doesn't eat even the mildest spices), so it'll be just more food for me and her!A few of the recipes that I'm most looking forward to preparing are Pecan Lime French Toast Casserole, Steak Fingers with Jalapeno Cream Gravy, Turkey Enchiladas with Sweet Potato Chipotle Sauce, and Peach Ice Cream. Doesn't that all sound delightful? There's way more where that came from! If you like spice, southern/Texan cooking, or just cooking for your family, this is a book that you should have on stand by.

Rob Walsh is a good go-to Texas cookbook author and I'm also recently impressed with \"United Tastes of Texas\" by Jessica Dupuy. I'm on the fence, however, with Homesick Texan. Her recipes seem like exactly what they are...an interpretation of Texas food from someone who moved to New York. Not always my idea authentic and sometimes a blend of Texas and other flavors. I see a lot of recipes that she has \"Texified\" by adding chipotle flavors (e.g. Chipotle blue cheese wedge salad). Speaking of chipotle there are about 117 recipes in this book (excluding the desserts chapter). Of these 15 called for chipotle peppers in adobo sauce, and an equal number or more called for another form of peppers or chipotle seasoning. I understand the significance of peppers in southern and Texmex cooking. It just seemed like a very high number of recipes used the chipotle peppers in adobo. They're easy to use for sure, but wow. I guess is just goes to show that everyone sees Texas foods differently and it's easy to emphasize certain ingredients and be both authentic and off the beaten path at the same time.I did end up giving the book 4 starts, however, for several reasons:1. Color photos with every recipe2. Simple instructions and approachable ingredients3. She pays homage to other flavors besides chipotle...even if it's just 1-2 recipes per geographic food or flavor 4. I would make/eat about 50-75% of the recipes in this book. That is a the true success of a cookbook!"}, {"userName": "Blessedmomfxs", "userReviewDate": "Aug 05, 2014", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/4832228-blessedmomfxs", "userReview": "I\u2019m a homesick Texan. I was born and raised in Texas and, although I\u2019ve lived elsewhere for more years than I lived there, Texas is always going to be home. Understandably, when I saw the title of the cookbook The Homesick Texan\u2019s Family Table, I HAD to find out if it was really all that! Yep. It is. I knew it was to be so when, thumbing through it for the first time, I found a picture of my high school football stadium! If you\u2019re a Texan, you know that finding THAT is a bona fide sign from the heavens!You don\u2019t have to be a Texan to love the recipes included in The Homesick Texan\u2019s Family Table. You have to abhor bland, tasteless, boiled food, but you don\u2019t have to be a Texan! The recipes included are all tied to traditional Texas fare with Lisa Fain\u2019s personal twist. If you\u2019re used to the traditional tastes, the backbone of the recipes are there and easily modified to their original homestyle Texan glory. Lisa\u2019s personalizations are wonderful though, so don\u2019t knock it \u2019til ya tried it! Most of the food, true to Texan tastes, will have a bit of a kick. Not all is spicy, but all will have flavor to wake up your tastebuds! Texans are known for their friendliness. This book will bring your family and friends to the table! There\u2019s no better way to strengthen relationships than gathering for a meal. Plan to do your visiting after dinner though. This food won\u2019t wait! Just looking through the cookbook, I was drooling. There is no doubt that you will find something among these recipes that you\u2019ll love!

We began walking the arrondissements and at a certain moment she looked at me and said, \u201cYou haven\u2019t looked at the map once. You know where you\u2019re going. How are you doing this?\u201d Well, I couldn\u2019t really answer her as my feet and heart just knew the rues as though they\u2019d always walked them. Yes, Paris is my heart home.I have that same reaction when I read books about the Deep South - Savannah, Charleston, the Blue Ridge Mountain area. And although I\u2019ve never visited there, I know that when I do, my feet and heart will already know their appropriate paths.Texas is another place that I feel kindred to. I\u2019m not sure whether it\u2019s because of my father\u2019s tales of when he lived in West Texas or the number of books I\u2019ve read since childhood that feature stories about Texas and Texans, but there is something about that state that calls to me.When I was perusing books to review, Lisa Fain\u2019s new cookbook The Homesick Texan's Family Table: Lone Star Cooking from My Kitchen to Yours called out to me - and I answered that summons immediately.From the moment I began reading, Lisa Fain\u2019s welcoming introduction connected with my heart. This isn\u2019t just a cookbook to follow, but a love letter to the generations of Texans before her who have passed along their treasured recipes.\u201cThere\u2019s this recurring dream that I have. I\u2019m in a field - my great-grandma\u2019s Texas cornfield to be exact. A long table loaded with dishes, bowls, and platters full of good food stretches through the green stalks, and surrounding the table is most everyone I\u2019ve ever known, both family and friends. My great-grandmother is there, and she waves me over. \u2018Mighty fine food and mighty fine people to eat it!\u201d she says as I take a seat. I then begin to eat a most memorable meal.\u201d - from Lisa Fain\u2019s preface to The Homesick Texan's Family TableBy sharing these recipes - and her wisdom - Fain is creating a way for us to create our \u201cmost memorable meals\u201d and transmit some Texas generosity and love to our friends and family. With each page I turned and recipe I read, I had to hold myself back from running into the kitchen to create some of this down home love.May I say that this is one of the most beautifully and lyrically illustrated cookbooks I\u2019ve read in quite a while. Personally I\u2019d love some of the photos to frame and hang, not only in my kitchen, but throughout my home. They are that beautiful. It\u2019s not surprising how well they integrate with Fain\u2019s stories and recipes as she\u2019s taken each one.As I continue to read her introductions to each section I fall a bit more in love with this homesick Texan\u2019s way of expressing herself. I\u2019d advise you to pick up your own copy of this cookbook, not just for the recipes, but for Fain\u2019s stories, like the one she that she relates introducing her tweak on Uncle Austin\u2019s Blueberry Granola.\u201cWhen I was working on my first book, Austin told me the most important thing was to have fun while I was writing it. If you are having fun, he said, then those who cook from it will have fun, too.\u201d - from Lisa Fain\u2019s preface to The Homesick Texan's Family TableHer uncle taught her well, as each recipe that Fain has shared bubbles with happiness and, yes, fun. These are dishes that you\u2019ll make time and again, and I relish her kitchen advice about kitchen equipment must-haves. She too uses her heritage cast-iron skillet for \u201cjust about everything - from deep-frying to saut\u00e9ing to even baking.\u201d This is my favorite kitchen item as well and knowing that she creates many of these recipes, using just that, made my day.In fact, Fain takes a lot of the fear and mystery out of food preparation when she shares that her kitchen is so small that:\u201cIf I stand in the middle of it, I can spread my arms and reach the outer boundaries on each side. There is one counter, a stove, and a narrow, shallow sink. There is no dishwasher, there is no walk-in pantry, and while there is a refrigerator, it doesn\u2019t fit in the space allotted and instead is halfway in the kitchen and halfway in the living area, straddling the border of both.\u201d - from Lisa Fain\u2019s About the Recipes section in The Homesick Texan's Family TableReading that excerpt, don\u2019t you feel reassured as a breath of relief and inner confidence imbue you? Why if she can cook these recipes in a tiny kitchen, not a restaurant-ready Top Chef kitchen, well, perhaps they can be re-created at home by you and me. And they can.That\u2019s the magic about this cookbook, as it contains recipes that have been around for generations, but are now updated and slightly tweaked by Fain for the way we live today. She seeks out fresh ingredients (I see myself haunting the Farmers' Market on Saturday morning) and even includes a recipe for home made chili powder that I can\u2019t wait to try.I love the fact that she shares some of the places beyond family and friends that she\u2019s found recipes, like her Creamy Macaroni and Cheese that is based upon a trick she found in a Texas Junior League cookbook. I've found a heart soul sister, as one of the things I most love to do is to haunt library sales and second hand bookstores in search of those quirky fundraising community recipe collections that feature favorites from church ladies, Junior Leagues, granges, and other community organizations.Speaking of which, I have both a digital copy of The Homesick Texan's Family Table as well as a hardcover edition. As you know, I\u2019m all about eBooks here, but I\u2019m going to be absolutely honest. I would advise you to buy the hardcover. It\u2019s just that beautiful. I\u2019ll use my eBook, Kindle version for everyday cooking, while the hardcover will reside on my kitchen\u2019s cookbook shelf to be brought out, time and again, when I seek a bit of inspiration, comfort, or just want a little of that happiness that Fain shares with her readers (and not get smudged with cooking detritus).Were I to pair Fain\u2019s recipe collection with some novels, a few authors spring to mind. Diana Palmer and her Texas biscuit-loving Hart brothers for one. (I love the fact that Lisa Fain cuts her biscuits with the metal closure from a Mason jar. Just brilliant and illustrated so beautifully in a photograph.) Having just read Melissa Cutler\u2019s Catcher Creek series, I immediately thought of chef Amy Sorentino from The Trouble With Cowboys (Catcher Creek Book 1).So if you love not only to cook, but to read about the wonders and joy of sharing food with family and friends, then Lisa Fain\u2019s The Homesick Texan's Family Table: Lone Star Cooking from My Kitchen to Yours is a must-read. If you are drawn to Texans, ranchers, and cowboys, add it to your TBR shelf. (Yes, Fain recreates a Cowboy Chili that sounds truly authentic and perfect for a cold winter night - or while out on the range during a roundup.)In addition, I\u2019ll be following Lisa Fain\u2019s Homesick Texan blog, http://www.homesicktexan.com, because just like I know when I\u2019ve found a heart home, in Fain I\u2019ve found a cooking heart sister.\u201cAnd that\u2019s what The Homesick Texan's Family Table is all about-making memories at the table with those whom we love. No matter if they are memories of sitting together for a simple weeknight dinner or jostling for space during a large holiday gathering, some of my fondest moments have occurred a the family table.\u201d - from Lisa Fain\u2019s introduction to The Homesick Texan's Family TableThank you Lisa Fain for sharing your wisdom and recipes so I can create treasured memories here, in my own home!I received this book from Blogging for Books and NetGalley for this fair and honest review."}, {"userName": "Stephanie", "userReviewDate": "Jul 07, 2017", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/9819222-stephanie", "userReview": "Can't wait to try some recipes from this book!

Such was the case with Lisa Fain, accomplished food blogger and author of The Homesick Texan Family Table cookbook. According to Fain, if you ask a Texan about their most memorable meal, it will not be one consumed at a fancy restaurant, but rather one enjoyed at the family table. I don't think I ever really thought about my most memorable meal until I read this book. I've dined along the canals in Venice, in the shadow of Notre Dame, had an omelet at 2:00 in the morning at a restaurant on London's Southhampton Row, but my most memorable, and enjoyable meals have been around a big table with family present. This, she says, is what her cookbook is all about, \"making memories at the table with those whom we love.\" What is not to love about a premise like that?Reading this book is like being at one of those meals. Fain is delightfully chatty and full of stories about family, friends, and great Texas food. My contention is that you can't get a bad meal in Texas, and this book proves it. Fain shares old family recipes from well-used recipe cards, family favorites, regional specialties, Tex-Mex, coastal, all the varieties of food that encompass the Texas cuisine. Displaced from Texas, she now makes her home in New York City, living in an apartment with a kitchen so small that, spreading her arms out, she can reach either side. There is one counter, a stove, small sink and refrigerator, but no dishwasher, no pantry, and no space for any utensil that doesn't have use, so has compiled a list of what she considers to be basic kitchen equipment at the beginning of the book to help aid new cooks in their selection. Shall we talk about the food? If the fact that I am salivating as I write this is any indication, clearly I loved this book. I don't think I have ever found so many recipes that I intend to make in just one cookbook. Now I am partial to Texas cuisine, having lived in Austin for a brief time, so I may be a bit prejudiced here, but the variety of offerings, interesting combination of tastes, recipes that are, for the most part, easy to prepare, all had me champing at the bit to get cooking. Each recipe has its own story and each is written in language that is easy to comprehend and follow. Breakfast is often a meal that leaves me stymied. Problem solved! It turns out that Texans take their breakfasts seriously, and there are, seriously, a lot of wonderful recipes to start out your day. I made the Dutch Baby pancake, Blueberry Granola, and Cranberry-Gruyere Scones, all winners. There is a recipe that I have yet to try, for homemade sausage, that sounds both easy and splendid. It will be on the breakfast table next week. Mouthwatering snacks abound, the zippy Bacon Jalape\u00f1o Cheese Ball and I-can't-stop-eating-them Orange-Cinnamon Candied Pecans were two of my favorites. The Coffee-Chipotle Pork Chops were on the dinner table this evening. Now, I did brine them for three hours before covering them with the rub (and, as such, cut way back on the called for salt), and I left them in the refrigerator for four hours past the suggested eight, but these were the most moist and flavorful chops that I think I have ever consumed. And easy, you bet! I love a recipe that takes little effort and a minimum of equipment, yet yields a lot of taste. Clearly, Fain knows what she's talking about when it comes to food. I'd tell you much more, but I'm afraid that you're just going to have to buy the book yourself.

Take it from Lisa Fain, a seventh-generation Texan who loves to cook and serve up the best dishes her home state has to offer\u2014even though she now lives half a country away. The Homesick Texan\u2019s Family Table showcases more than 100 of Lisa\u2019s best and most-loved recipes, ranging from down-home standards (think cheesy nachos, comforting chicken and dumplings, and fiery wings) to contemporary riffs on the classics (who knew adding Mexican spices to a German chocolate cake would taste so good?). All of Lisa\u2019s recipes are made with fresh, seasonal ingredients, yet still packed with real Texas flavor that will make your grandmother smile. Whether you\u2019re looking for a party-friendly snack like Pigs in Jalape\u00f1o Blankets, a Mustard Coleslaw to bring as a side to your next potluck, a weeknight- and family-friendly meal like Steak Fingers with Cream Gravy, or a mouthwatering dessert like Ruby Red Grapefruit and Pecan Sheet Cake, The Homesick Texan\u2019s Family Table has you covered. After all, with some mighty fine food and mighty fine people to enjoy it, any meal can be cause for celebration.About the Author:LISA FAIN is a seventh-generation Texan. When she's not on the hunt for chile peppers, she writes and photographs the popular food blog Homesick Texan. Lisa's writing has appeared in Saveur and Edible Austin and on the blog Serious Eats, and her photographs have been exhibited worldwide, with two in the permanent collection of the Library of Congress. An active member of Foodways Texas and the Southern Foodways Alliance, Lisa is also a certified barbecue judge. Visit www.homesicktexan.com My Review: Upon receiving this cookbook and reading through it, I think I may be from Texas even though I have never even visited. Many if not all of the dishes contained in the book I have made at least once. This book has some great recipes and the full color photographs of the finished product is mouth watering---they look so good! The nachos on the front cover are delish! I'm not a fan of guacamole but I would definitely add more jalapeno peppers to mine. The author has everything from appetizers, breakfast, salads, soups, stews, dinner, and even some yummy sweets.

It is easy to recognize certain smells, and hopefully if they are the good ones, we have a positive reaction to them. For example, chocolate chip cookies or the cologne or perfume your significant other wears. I think taste is just as strong of a sense as smell. My mom passed away three years ago, and I can still imagine the taste of her homemade apple pie or vegetable beef soup. The Homesick Texan's Family Table by Lisa Fain is a journey into Lisa's life of growing up in Texas and creating her favorite dishes in her new home in New York. When I first started looking through this book, I had to put it down and grab some sticky notes to start marking pages. If the photos in the book didn't have my stomach growling, some of the stories behind the dishes and why they were important to the author made me want to try them as well. Lisa's vignettes for each recipe makes the dish special. It gets beyond just tasting good. The book is a demonstration that food is about more than just tasting good, but about the people you can enjoy it with (although no one is going to complain about tasty food).As for the recipes themselves, I can't wait to start trying some out (a few recipes had me thinking through what I had in my pantry to see if I could make it). Lisa also includes a myriad of helpful tips through her book, and in her introduction she explains how tiny her kitchen is and what tools she believes are absolute necessities. This means that just about everyone can use this cookbook with things they probably already have in their kitchen (or only need to get a thing or two beyond ingredients).She covers some basics about the peppers that she favors in the book, as well as tips on making your own dried chilies or chili powder. Since we planted some peppers in our garden this year, I have every intention of trying this. She also gives some helpful suggestions about food storage for certain things and ends with some accompaniment/condiment recipes that are good for canning.As someone who can be a bit of a picky eater, I found dozens of recipes in this book that I am excited to try. Then again, I do love about any recipe with cheese and peppers, a couple of staples in this book. So, if you love Mexican or Tex-Mex type foods, I would suggest you get this book right away. I don't think you will be disappointed.\ufeff**I received this book for free from Blogging For Books for this review.**"}, {"userName": "DelAnne Frazee", "userReviewDate": "May 05, 2016", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/14913354-delanne-frazee", "userReview": "Title: The Homesick Texan's Family Table - Lone Star Cooking from My Kitchen to YoursAuthor: Lisa Fain\t\tPublished: 4-1-14\t\t\t Publisher: Ten Speed Press\t\t\tPages: 288Genre: Cooking, Food & Wine\t\t\tSub Genre: Cookbooks; ISBN: 9781607745044\t\t\tASIN: B00FO61A1SReviewer: DelAnne\t\t\tReviewed For: NetGalley\t\t\tMy Rating: 5 Stars\t\t\t. \tI lived in Donna, Texas of the Rio Grand Valley for over three years and each off day I would head across the border to explore the lands that I had learned about in high school Spanish classes. Imagine learning Spanish a German teacher in a predominantly Cuban and military dependants learning Castilian Spanish. I learned to love Cuban food from visiting with my friends, but still got my Mexican and South Western food from fast food restaurants. Then my family moved to the Valley and I never looked back. Now I know the difference, perfected my accent and my cooking technique from those who were kind enough to share their time and recipes with me. I was shocked to see the Black Bean Refried Beans as most people use pinto. It was then I knew I had to have this book. Add in the Buttermilk Bacon-Fat Tortillas ( which taste better when placed in an adobe oven) and I was ready to spend some quality time with Ms Fain's recipes and my kitchen. Thank you so much for The Homesick Texan's Family Table. I did not realize how much I missed Texas until I was reading and saw the field of bluebonnets. These are classic Texan recipes I just gravitated to those with the Mexican influence. They are well written in a easy to follow format with clear instructions. Once you try these you will be staying home making your own Texas and Mexican dishes. Let me suggest the Jalapeno Pimento Cheese and Shredded Beef Enchiladas.

The recipes in this cookbook aren't lofty or overly ambitious, but are instead completely manageable and appealing. I received the Kindle version of this cookbook and it was easy to navigate and the picture quality is wonderful. Cookbooks on an eReader will probably never be my favorite, but this one is done very well. Each section of the cookbook is well laid out and organized and I particularly like the glossary of the different types of peppers with their attributes and uses. Nicely done Lisa! In the breakfast section she has a recipe for homemade Buttermilk Bacon Fat Flour Tortillas. SHUT UP! This cookbook is not for those of us who would like to loose a pound or two, but when you are ready for a little indulgence this is the cookbook to go to. My husband is a big fan of brisket so I had to give the brisket tacos a try and they were a huge success! Another recipe that I want to give a go is the Balsamic-tarragon Glazed Ham which may end up being my Easter ham this year. I'd also like to make her version of Lemon pie which looks very easy to make with clear and precise instructions so that maybe I will have a chance of a non-runny pie!If you are looking for a good cookbook with lots of beautifully photographed food as well a drool inducing recipes, give this one a try when it comes out on April 1st, You won't be disappointed!*I received a copy of this cookbook from Netgalley/Ten Speed Press in exchange for an honest review.*You can find more at The Blissful Plate http://theblissfulplate.blogspot.com/"}, {"userName": "Virginia Campbell", "userReviewDate": "Sep 11, 2014", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/2333268-virginia-campbell", "userReview": "Popular food writer and blogger Lisa Fain is known as \"The Homesick Texan\"--a seventh-generation Texan who now lives in New York City. Her self-titled blog and debut cookbook have been a great success, and she further delights and entertains readers and cooks with \"The Homesick Texan's Family Table\". Filled with beautiful color photos of fabulous food, pretty pastoral scenes of the Texas landscape and other subjects, and recipes that rock the house, this cookbook is also a memoir of why each recipe was included in the book. Beginning with an illuminating section on chile peppers--a Texas cooking essential--the chapters then lead us from \"Breakfast and Breads\" all the way through to \"Sweets\" and \"Accompaniments\". The ingredients are fresh and flavorful, and tradition is often given a tasty tweak with a new spin on an old favorite. Good food just naturally goes with good company and good times. Here are some of the recipes that tempt and tantalize my taste buds: \"Bacon-Molasses Breakfast Sausage\"; \"Bacon-Cheddar Chipotle Biscuits\"; \"Pico De Gallo Deviled Eggs\"; \"Apple-Walnut Salad\"; \"Chipotle-Blue Cheese Wedge Salad\"; \"Cowboy Beans\"; \"Balsamic-Tarragon Glazed Ham\"; \"Southeast Texas Gumbo\"; \"Coffee-Chipotle Pork Chops\"; \"Butterscotch Brownies\"; \"Mexican Chocolate Cake\"; and \"Cranberry-Green Chile Salsa\".

Her recipes are authentic and don\u2019t use shortcuts or processed ingredients. From mouth-watering breakfast dishes (Hello! Bacon-molasses breakfast sausage?!) to tasty appetizers and sides, this cookbook is full of recipes you won\u2019t want to miss! I also love the conversational style of the author and how she weaves in her own personal history and heritage into the pages of the book. The photography is fabulous too!

Even though I\u2019m stuck here in the mid-Atlantic I can still enjoy some good ole Texas dishes.

I haven't made anything from the book yet so I can't comment on the actual quality and execution of the recipes, but they seem great and very appealing. I'm a southern girl, so the author's talk of home and the importance of food to her Texas family really resonated with me, eventhough I'm from North Carolina and not Texas. Although some of the food is very different, the attitude about food and family seems much the same. And, in truth, the bare bones of the food is very similar to what I grew up on. True I didn't grow up eating tons of chiles and Tex Mex food, but southern food no matter what state comes down to being about simple ingredients, being hearty and overall just comforting.Aside from the recipes I really enjoyed the photos and the commentary and felt that the author did a great job of explaining the how-to's of certain tasks everyone may not know how to do, such a rehydrating chilis."}, {"userName": "Jenn Ballmann", "userReviewDate": "Jul 03, 2014", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/28821690-jenn-ballmann", "userReview": "I was sent a copy of the book for review through Net Galley, as always, all opinions are my own.While I loved reading the stories Lisa Fain has chosen to intersperse throughout this book I didn\u2019t enjoy the recipes as much as I thought I would. They remind me very much of the types of food I ate while growing up, but these days I prefer to eat a much more healthy and well-balance diet. The recipes are simple and straightforward, you won\u2019t need a ton of specialty gadgets to make the recipes and they are great for a beginning cook. My biggest problem with the book is that these are very typical American recipes, while some of them do have a bit of a twist to them, there isn\u2019t enough there for me to want to purchase this book.

As a Texan with German heritage, I especially appreciated the nod to German-immigrant recipes alongside the more typical Mexican and South-Western fare.

A smidgeon of jalape\u00f1o. A dash of chipotle. Fabulous. Here's the quote I loved from the book:\"It's been said that if you ask a Texan about their most memorable meal, they won't tell you about a coveted reservation at a five-star temple of dining, or an exotic feast served after an airplane flight half way across the world. Nope, most Texans will say that their most memorable meal was home-cooked, shared at the family table.
