I honestly think it's a profoundly more true and powerful book than Gatsby ever will be. His effortless and viceral writing tells a story of such complex and accurate human relationships, I often find myself reflecting on Dick Diver as a friend I should check up on, and part of me thinks I spent a year of my youth hanging out on the French Riveria having too much to drink, but somehow pulling it off sophistication. Now that I sound like a lunatic, I must express this is not normal for me. The world and characters really got under my skin. After my first reading I woke myself by weeping...and I was weeping for the characters. That has never before or since happened to me. It is a work of profound beauty and pain about the resilience of the human spirit. If you're feeling the world is too glib, I feel this is a great antidote."}, {"userName": "Martine", "userReviewDate": "Sep 29, 2009", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/381149-martine", "userReview": "How is one to feel about a protagonist who frequently displays signs of elitism, sexism, bigotry and homophobia, finds himself worryingly attracted to young girls, has no goal in life except to make himself useful to damsels in distress, and drinks away his career and marriage, ending up a mere shadow of his former self? Is one supposed to regard him as a tragic hero? Is one to sympathise with him? And if one does sympathise with him, is that because of the way he was written, or rather because we are aware that he is a thinly veiled version of the author himself, a giant of early-twentieth American literature?Those were some of the questions I pondered after reading Tender Is the Night, F. Scott Fitzgerald's last finished novel, and possibly his most autobiographical one. Set in France and Italy in the 1920s, it tells the story of two wealthy American expats, Dick and Nicole Diver (largely based on the author and his wife Zelda), who seem to others the most glamorous couple ever, 'as fine-looking a couple as could be found in Paris', but are finding their private lives increasingly less glamorous. We first see the couple through the eyes of Rosemary Hoyt, a young and naive American actress holidaying in Europe. Rosemary falls madly in love with suave Dick, but also admires angelic Nicole. After about 130 pages during which Rosemary hangs out with the Divers and nearly embarks on an affair with Dick, the narrative stops and goes back in time to tell the story of Dick and Nicole's marriage, which is considerably more complicated than Rosemary realises. Nicole, it turns out, has a history of mental illness, and Dick is both her husband and the doctor treating her -- a recipe for disaster, obviously. Being a tale of needy people, broken relationships, loss of purpose and wasted potential, Tender Is the Night is quite a depressing read, and one's appreciation of it largely depends on one's tolerance for that kind of thing. If you like your books bleak and tragic, chances are you'll appreciate Tender Is the Night. If not, you might want to steer clear of it.I generally love a good tragedy, but I confess I wasn't overly impressed with Tender Is the Night. For a book which has garnered so many rave reviews, I found it remarkably flawed. Fitzgerald himself seems to have somewhat agreed with me. Despite referring to Tender Is the Night as his masterpiece and being shocked by its lack of critical and commercial success, he began reconstructing it a few years before his death, placing the flashback chapters at the beginning and making all the textual alterations required by this change. However, he died before he could finish the project, or perhaps he abandoned the project as not worth completing (no one seems to know for sure). A friend of his, Malcolm Cowley, then completed the revision, and for years this was the standard edition of the book. However, the Cowley version has fallen into scholarly disfavour (or so Penguin informs me), and several publishers, Penguin included, now use the first edition, the one that Fitzgerald thought needed revision. Apparently, there are no fewer than seventeen versions of the novel extant, which says much about how satisfied Fitzgerald was with his own work. My guess? Not very much.I read a version based on the first edition of the book, and to be honest, I can see why Fitzgerald felt it needed some work. Tender Is the Night felt very disjointed to me. To a certain extent, this was because of the aforementioned non-linear structure, which felt a bit jarring to me. However, as far as I'm concerned, that is not the book's only problem, nor even its biggest one. What most annoyed me was the way in which the perspective keeps shifting. Fitzgerald uses an omniscient narrator in Tender Is the Night, but not consistently so; the story is always written from a certain character's perspective. Sometimes the perspective is Rosemary's, sometimes it's Dick or Nicole's; even the minor characters have stretches of the story told from their perspectives, often on the same page as a main character's perspective. To me, these shifts in point of view often felt haphazard, not to mention a little jarring. I didn't think they were particularly effective, either, as they hardly build on each other and don't provide any information that couldn't be gleaned from a 'regular' omniscient narrator. I may be in a minority here, but I think the book would have benefited from a more consistent approach to perspective. The story itself is a bit haphazard, as well. It occasionally drags, it has little plot, and there are quite a few scenes and storylines which don't really go anywhere. Among several other seemingly unlikely scenes, the book contains a murder, a shooting and a duel, none of which is fully integrated into the story, and none of which is given proper significance. Scenes are introduced and then left so randomly that you have to wonder why Fitzgerald bothered to include them at all. At the risk of being unkind and judgemental, I guess that's what being an alcoholic will do for an author: it gives you wild ideas, but prevents you from carrying them out properly.Which brings me to the characterisation. I'll probably get a lot of flak for this, but I felt that Fitzgerald's vaunted characterisation was a bit 'off' in this novel. Many of the minor characters are sketchily drawn, whereas the main characters are described well (sometimes brilliantly so), but never properly explained. While Fitzgerald does a good (and occasionally excellent) job of sharing his protagonists' feelings, he hardly ever bothers to explain their motivations. This particularly bothered me in the parts written from Dick Diver's point of view, as Dick is supposed to be a psychiatrist. By rights, he should be analysing people actions and motivations all the time, and asking lots of questions. However, Dick hardly ever asks questions. He does not even ask himself questions. He never wonders why he is so drawn to young girls, or what it is in him that causes him to need to be their saviour. He just observes other people in a way of which any intelligent person (trained psychologist or not) would be capable, and then describes their behaviour in a few felicitous phrases. For this and other reasons, I didn't buy Dick Diver as a psychiatrist. Fitzgerald may have read up on psychology (and undoubtedly learned a lot from the doctors who treated his own wife), but I never found his alter ego convincing as a psychiatrist, let alone a brilliant psychiatrist. To me, Dick has 'writer' written all over him.It's a pity I kept finding such flaws, because Tender Is the Night obviously had the potential to be amazing. It has all the right ingredients: interesting (albeit snobbish and bored) characters, powerful themes, evocative (albeit frequently vague) writing, you name it. And the story certainly doesn't lack in pathos. It is quite harrowing to watch Dick Diver, a supposedly brilliant and popular man who never lives up to his potential and is increasingly torn asunder by money, alcoholism and his failed marriage to a mentally ill woman, go to pieces, becoming, in his own words, 'the Black Death' ('I don't seem to bring people happiness any more'). The fact that this was Fitzgerald writing about himself, about his own frustrations and shattered dreams, adds considerable poignancy to the reading experience. Even so, Tender Is the Night ended up leaving me fairly cold, as I simply didn't care for Dick enough to be genuinely moved by his descent into failure. While others may find Dick a swell guy, I myself found his complacency and lack of purpose grating, his alcoholism exasperating, and his brilliance skin-deep. I seem to be alone in this opinion, but I stand by it. In summary, then, I enjoyed and admired aspects of Tender Is the Night, but I don't think they add up to a great whole. While I appreciate Fitzgerald's brutal honesty and the masterful way in which he evokes mutual dependence, isolation and frustration, I can't shake off the feeling that the book could have been much better than it ended up being. And this pains me, as I hate wasted potential as much as Fitzgerald himself seems to have done. As it is, Tender Is the Night is in my opinion not just a book about wasted potential, but an example of wasted potential. It is fitting, I suppose, but no less disappointing for that.3.5 stars, rounded down to three because I really didn't like it as much as many of the books I have given four stars lately."}, {"userName": "Jeanette  \"Astute Crabbist\"", "userReviewDate": "Jun 30, 2011", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/796425-jeanette-astute-crabbist", "userReview": "This book is so pointless, you could read the chapters in random order and probably not feel like you'd missed much.

books that leave you at a loss as to how to dismiss them. Reading this I kept thinking of a line from Stoppard's The Real Thing: \u2018There\u2019s something scary about stupidity made coherent. I can deal with idiots, and I can deal with sensible argument, but I don\u2019t know how to deal with you.\u2019 Tender is the Night is not stupid, but it is, if you like, triviality made coherent. The story of a wealthy married couple going through a mid-life crisis, it's such a nothingy narrative couched in formally perfect prose that attacking it feels like swinging at a ghost \u2013 the disparity between form and content is dizzying. It's like watching Stephen Hawking spend half an hour punching something into his speech computer, only to hear it reel off a haiku about Joey Essex.Where to start. Construction-wise, it's a complete mess; Fitzgerald realised this, and was still rearranging chapters until he died, hoping for a rehabilitation which the novel has eventually found (it was panned on release). In its original, and most commonly printed, form, the first hundred and twenty pages introduce a baffling profusion of characters with no discernible story, at which point the narrative drops back a few years to set up the main couple of Dick and Nicole, a charmless pair of socialites based fairly closely on F. Scott and Zelda.A chronological reordering might, perhaps, solve some of the problems, although personally I would advocate cutting the opening section altogether, dropping the middle bit, and then drastically abridging the end section, so that you're left with a slim pamphlet consisting of a nice speech about the First World War, some good descriptions of Zurich, an extramarital fumble in a French hotel room, and then a speedy conclusion. Job done.Instead it just goes on and on, retailing anecdotes about peripheral characters who seem to spend the whole book going through a series of boring encounters designed only to highlight the period's casual racism, homophobia and misogyny. It's difficult to overstress how little I cared about anyone in here. The settings \u2013 Nice, Rome, Lausanne \u2013 should provide colour, but in fact they have few distinguishing features, becoming interchangeable stops on a general American-eye view of Yurp. In Gatsby I had loved Fitzgerald's nocturnal flights of melancholy prose; here, instead, he seems to be in a sort of Hemingway mode, all flat cynicism and brittle dialogue and bitter comments about \u2018the opportunistic memory of women\u2019.Most of all, perhaps, I hated the equation drawn between professional productivity and personal happiness. The long, drawn-out decline and fall which comprises the latter half of the novel tries to show that Dick is a failure as a man because he never completed his book and because he develops a greater affection for his children. Don't get me wrong, Dick is \u2013 well \u2013 he's a dick, isn't he \u2013 but all the same, I thought it seemed a bit unfair to argue that because he chooses not to fight to keep his adulterous wife, and instead ends up practising medicine in a tiny town in New York state, that he's somehow therefore an archetypal symbol of a wasted life."}, {"userName": "Vessey", "userReviewDate": "Oct 06, 2014", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/30910845-vessey", "userReview": "SPOILERS\n\"He wished she had no background, that she was just a girl lost with no address save the night from which she had come.\"\nTender is the Night is a love story. It is also a story about loneliness. But mostly, it is about the need to love and belong. Dick Diver falls in love with mentally ill woman and marries her. But he never truly finds happiness with her. He falls in love with an young actress, but he never gets to be with her, because his connection with and his love for his sick wife are too strong. And he goes through life alone, leading a battle that cannot be won. This is a beautiful and touching book, but it is also adamant in the way it shows what loneliness, what falling in love with the wrong person can do to us. Still, does loving a person you cannot be happy with mean that you have truly chosen (as much as love is choice) the wrong person? There are those of us who love those that cannot be reached, that cannot be saved, even those don\u2019t love us back. For which do we need bigger strength? To quit loving such person or to go on loving them? Is Dick\u2019s growing detachment from Nicole a sign for the diminishing of his love or his loss of hope? Can a distinction be made? Do we love a person only when we believe there is a chance for them to turn into what we need them to be and for us to be happy with them? We dream of finding that perfect person, for the connection that breaks us apart and builds us all over again, but what happens when we meet an already broken person whose pieces are there, waiting for us to pick them up and put the puzzle back together, only to realize that there will always be a piece that will be missing, that won\u2019t fit as we need it to? I believe that when we love, it is forever. Love that dies is no love, unless the object of our love changes severely. But maybe sometimes the person hasn\u2019t become so different as we think, maybe they are the same, and it us who have changed without realizing it and this has lead to a change of heart.\n\u201cThink how you love me. I don\u2019t ask you to love me always like this, but I ask you to remember. Somewhere inside me there\u2019ll always be the person I am tonight.\u201d\nIf the person we have grown to love stays forever there, under some form, does the part of us that loves this person goes on existing even while we feel that with another part of ourselves we slip away from our loved one\u2019s reach and start needing new horizons, new lands to explore, new hearts to conquer? Is there such thing as loving only with a part of yourself or is love something that sweeps you completely and you love with your whole being? Do humans have the potential, the depth to love absolutely and completely? Or is love fragmented, like we are fragmented? Is it possible for the part that loves and the part that stays indifferent (or even hates) to be two sides of the same coin, two faces of the same feeling? Dick Diver goes on loving his wife, but a part of him grows cold. This terrible contradiction comes not from weakening of his love for her, but from his inability to connect to her. Are love and connection the same thing? I thought so. I am not so sure anymore. He loves her, but feels disconnected from her.\n\"He moved on through the rain, demoniac and frightened, the passions of many men inside him and nothing simple that he could see.\"\nIf we are ready to love without connection does that make our love extraordinarily strong or not strong enough? Can a man who loves a woman whole-heartedly accept only half of her, fragments of her, isn\u2019t the strongest kind of love the one that compels us to either have a full possession of somebody or walk away, because we love them too much to bear to have only fragments of them? Or is the strongest love the one because of which we are ready to make any sacrifices and accept even the smallest particles, when even the smallest piece is better than nothing, when we are ready to sacrifice our life, our pride, our very essence? Dick Diver feels like he has lost an essential part of himself, a part that leaves any real feeling in him incomplete. If we sacrifice too much for the loved one, so much as we no longer feel as ourselves, can love survive? Does true love transcends all? Which is the stronger? The love we bear for the other person or our sense of self? When the sense of self vanishes, do we keep loving? Would Dick have been happier had he left Nicole? Would he have been happy with Rosemary? I think not. When we love somebody, we bear all their baggage, their pain overwhelms us, it becomes a part of us, but the same is valid for their joy, for everything amazing they are and everything amazing they give us. We are overwhelmed, but the mere fact that we love someone so deeply as to let ourselves be overwhelmed gives us a sense of security and belonging and fullness.\n\"He knew that the price of his intactness was incompleteness.\"\n\n They made no love that day, but when he left her outside the sad door on the Zurichsee and she turned and looked at him he knew her problem was one they had together for good now\nIs his love for her weakness or strength? Or both? When we truly love, how much do we belong to ourselves and how much to the other person?\n\"There were now no more plans than if he had arbitrarily made some indissoluble mixture, with atoms joined and inseparable; you could throw it all out but never again could they fit back into atomic scale. As he held her and tasted her, and as she curved in further and further toward him, new to herself, drowned and engulfed in love, he was thankful to have an existence at all, if only as a reflection in her wet eyes.\"\nI believe that no two people are absolutely alike or absolutely different, therefore there is no such thing as an absolute harmony or absolute disconnection. The relationship between Dick and Nicole, however strong or weak, keeps on living and tearing him apart. When the relationship does not bring us happiness, when the pain prevails, is it still love? Does true love mean that no matter the circumstances, we can always find some happiness, some spark there? Or do we love even when the passion no longer exists and desperation and emptiness fill our hearts and minds and hang over us and touch us like a pale, cold sun, so alike and unlike the real one that once kept it all alive, but has now melted and disappeared into space, leaving us merely with the memory?\nIt was not so much infatuation as a romantic memory. She was still his girl\nTender Is the Night left me incredibly satisfied and yearning at the same time. I wish Scott Fitzgerald had developed Nicole\u2019s character more. Or Rosemary\u2019s. But with Dick himself being the main focus and how his love and longing, pain and loneliness affect his life and personality, they were more of a catalyst for him than actual characters in the novel. I think that had Fitzgerald given them more personality, this would have been a five-star book for me. Still, it was a great experience.

I read it back to back with This Side of Paradise last year, which was an interesting experiment. I had the young, beautiful, self-confident Fitzgerald and the Fitzgerald of post-Zelda's craziness, dark dark alcoholic Fitzgerald. Besides showing obviously how much his skills had improved, it showed the sheer range he was capable of as well. This is a dark, depressing novel. Loss, loneliness, isolation, desolation. It does not end well. But the sheer power of the prose, and just how completely lost everything is here can't fail to get to you. The story is so tight, well put together, flows along without a hitch. It sinks you slowly lower and lower and lower until you're hardly aware of just how dark of a place the novel has gone. And then all of a sudden things evaporate, and there you are. Just like Fitzgerald. Wandering off the last page.Really. I recommend it to everyone.

I say tender is a woman's psyche, and the man's ego that tries to make it strong. Too bad both of them suffer from a severe case of asshatitis. \"Tender is the Night\" is the story of Dick Diver and his Wife Nicole. You don't actually find this out until a fourth of the way into the book. At first we meet the happy couple through the eyes of Rosemary, a young actress from America with a Norman Bates styled affinity for \"Mother.\" She quickly latches onto Mr. Diver, his charms no match for her ignorance and youth. They all hang out together, doing rich people things like eating, and hanging out at the beach, and hating minorities (It is the 20's after all), and all other sorts of things that make you want to slash the tires on their Rolls.Book two abandons Rosemary and we focus on Dick Diver, Psychiatrist at Large. He doesn't actually do much psycho analyzing, but spends most of his time wondering why he married Nicole in the first place and developing a drinking problem. Turns out Nicole is cuckoo for cocoa puffs, and Dick married her with some God complex of trying to save her. But all he ends up doing is ruining himself.Book three continues the downfall, kind of told through Nicole's eyes. Dick falls further and further down the rabbit hole while Nicole seems to see daylight in the fog of her crazy. She ends up pulling a Dick (Diver. Head out of the gutter people) but with the opposite reaction of what it did to him. I think.This book isn't necessarily long, though it feels like it. Long passages of time pass in one paragraph, making it confusing and a rather dull read. None of the characters are likable, and I think you end up just wishing all of them went the way of Abe North. Speaking of, what the heck DID happen to Abe North. That story line was never really resolved.They say it took him forever to write this and it kind of feels like it. It doesn't connect very well and you wonder how much is Fitz's desperate cry for help from his own life full of money and ruin.

Scott Fitzgerald free existence. The name was familiar enough although I mostly associated it with those bulky Penguin Classics which are prone to making me break out in a cold-sweat. Weighty tomes burdened by commentary on class difference, forbidden or tormented or doomed romance, some of which are drier than a mouthful of Jacob's Crackers. I am F. Scott Fitzgerald-free no longer! And how glad does this make me? Very. I read The Great Gatsby a couple of months ago and decided to go for a second hit with Tender is the Night, Fitzgerald's almost autobiographical tale of gilt edged glitz which conceals the slow ripening of mental decay on the French Riviera. But first I need to get the childishness out of the way. I approached this book with all literary seriousness - arched eyebrow, wire rimmed glasses and a suitable severe chignon and after a medium sized smirk at introduction to the principle character with the manly moniker, Dick Diver, I was prepared to be serious again. Then it hit me.Page 4. There it was. \"Lucky Dick, you big stiff\" he whispered to himself. And then I rolled off the sofa, laughing. And so begins my encounter with Tender is the Night, which is otherwise quite serious but in places, far from tender. Published in 1934, at a time of economic austerity, Fitzgerald's emotionally disturbed tale of rich people being a bit sad, but still being rich, was not well received and was soundly panned in a number of reviews. Presumably the people of America waved their empty plates, wiped the dust from their eyes and shouted \"Yes life is not great but try an empty belly, Dust Pneumonia and burying your own children\".Mental health and sexual abuse, are by no means, trifling issues and they are key issues in Tender is the Night, however set against a back drop of yachts, lavish parties and luxury mansions at a time of national economic catastrophe, well presumably they just seemed a bit less important.Add to this to the fact that frankly, none of the characters are particularly likeable, well you can see why people looked askance at the time. Dick Diver falls into a number of unfortunate but obvious traps. Marries way out of his league, marries a mentally unstable patient with whom he was originally professionally involved and then to cap it all, has an affair. Way to go Dick. I'm pretty sure that the Hippocratic oath probably says \"don't do this\" against all of these possible actions.Because this book is based on Fitzgerald's own experiences with his wife Zelda it is better than Gatsby. Not happier, not brighter, not more exhilarating to read but it has a clarity that makes the characters more real. After all, nobody said you had to like them or their actions."}, {"userName": "Kyriakos Sorokkou", "userReviewDate": "Dec 07, 2017", "userURL":

This book was a hot mess and such a disappointment compared to \"The Great Gatsby\" which is a favourite of mine. Right from the beginning, I had no idea where this dishevelled story was going, and having now finished it I'm still not sure what the overall point of it was. Sure, \"Tender Is the Night\" comes with some beautiful passages and observations on life and people, but it also comes with a bunch of contradicting themes and destinies that all go in different directions. I get that the overall storyline is about Nicole's and Dick's marriage but I didn't really care about them. The same goes for pretty much all of the characters except for Rosemary whom I found blossoming and therefore interesting. Unfortunately, we don't get to hear much about her. I didn't hate this book (I did finish it, after all), but I didn't like it much either. It's going to be interesting to see how my last book by Fitzgerald, \"This Side of Paradise\", is going to go down with me."}, {"userName": "Steven  Godin", "userReviewDate": "Dec 18, 2016", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/26706841-steven-godin", "userReview": "Time is our most valuable commodity.

It should be the type of plot we're attracted to, because it's a dissolution story, not unlike LOST WEEKEND or LEAVING LAS VEGAS, to name but two examples of the genre. And yet many friends I share this with just can't get into it. Part of the blame lies with the style: it's just so damned intricate and thick, it tends to scare away those who don't want to be ravished by style. As someone who does, I can get lost in this book any day of the week. I reread this for work probably once a year, and I'm always amazed at how fresh it seems to me---mainly because I'm always discovering a line or phrase that I'd passed over.Other reasons to like TITN: It's Fitzgerald's most experimental, with just about every modernist trick in the book. It has two fantastic heroines that come to life when they emerge from Dick Diver's point of view: Nicole and Rosemary. There are glamorous excursions from Nice to Paris and Rome. It has that overwhelming sense of abstraction---it feels like you're reading history, a socialist critique of excess capitalism (check out the chapter on Nicole's shopping spree), a look into the prurience and spectatorship of early filmmaking, a dressing down of romanticism, and a love story about the impossibility of love.Oh, and its so achingly, gloriously sad---I think that's the main reason I consider it a classic."}, {"userName": "\u00b7Karen\u00b7", "userReviewDate": "Mar 09, 2011", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/1652898-karen", "userReview": "There is something deeply ambivalent about Fitzgerald's appraisal of the dissipation, drunkenness and fatuous frivolity of a world to which he himself belonged. Surely we can only condemn the characters for their snobbery, their thoughtlessness, their attitude that money should get them out of the kind of difficulty that they have brought upon themselves through ignorance, self-deception or sheer bloody-mindedness? And yet at the same time we can feel sympathy for fragile Nicole, for Dick's descent into oblivion, for Rosemary's innocence. These are the characters that Fitzgerald treats with sympathy and kindness, whereas the McKiscos, whose only crime seems to be that they are not 'well-bred', are cruelly done by:\nDick laid aside his reading and, after the few minutes that it took to realize the change in McKisco, the disappearance of the man\u2019s annoying sense of inferiority, found himself pleased to talk to him. McKisco was \u201cwell-informed\u201d on a range of subjects wider than Goethe\u2019s \u2014 it was interesting to listen to the innumerable facile combinations that he referred to as his opinions. They struck up an acquaintance, and Dick had several meals with them. The McKiscos had been invited to sit at the captain\u2019s table but with nascent snobbery they told Dick that they \u201ccouldn\u2019t stand that bunch.\u201dViolet was very grand now, decked out by the grand couturi\u00e8res, charmed about the little discoveries that well-bred girls make in their teens. She could, indeed, have learned them from her mother in Boise but her soul was born dismally in the small movie houses of Idaho, and she had had no time for her mother. Now she \u201cbelonged\u201d\u2014 together with several million other people \u2014 and she was happy, though her husband still shushed her when she grew violently na\u00efve.\nDoes that reveal a deep-seated sense of superiority in the narrator, or is he making fun of the McKiscos' ambition, of their wish to belong to this tawdry world of high society? Does Dick marry Nicole for her money or for love? Is Dick brilliant or merely self-aggrandizing? There were so many questions left open in my mind, but then that is the mark of a classic, one that is not closed off, reduced to only one obvious interpretation, but a work that opens up possibilities in the imagination."}, {"userName": "Empress", "userReviewDate": "Aug 12, 2007", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/165861-empress", "userReview": "I am trying to like this book because for some reason I think that I should.But, in truth, I am finding it quite dull and painfully slow.

No stimuli worked upon them, no voices called them from without, no fragments of heir own thoughts came suddenly from the minds of others, and missing the clamour of Empire they felt that life was not continuing here.\"- F. Scott Fitzgerald, Tender is the NightFitzgerald has an absolutely beautiful way with words. He uses very stylized language and writes down some profound thoughts. And that\u2019s what tricked me at first into thinking this would be a profound story. Like in The Great Gatsby, his characters are not likeable and just seem so disconnected from the world. It\u2019s quite interesting reading Fitzgerald writing about American life in France, including black riots, at the same time that I was reading Langston Hughes The Great Big Sea: the contrast between the lives of black and white Americans in France in this period is huge.This is a story about rich Americans in the French Riviera. The story revolves in part around Dr. Dick Diver, charming man, the ultimate host and object of adoration of teenager Rosemary, an upcoming actress, who Fitzgerald describes thus: \u201cHer body hovered delicately on the last edge of childhood\u2013she was almost eighteen, nearly complete, but the dew was still on her.\u201d Attraction between the two is immediate, despite the fact that Dick is married.I was raving about this book at first. Fitzgerald is an amazing writer and I think that his writing style initially blinded me to the flatness of the plot. The last thing I want to read is a book about privileged shallow and selfish rich people who are not introspective and just do whatever they please, but when Fitzgerald writes passages like the following, it makes it a bit easier to stomach, and fills you with hope that the characters in the book will say things you actually want to hear: \u201cFollowing a walk marked by an intangible mist of bloom that followed the white border stones she came to a space overlooking the sea where there were lanterns asleep in the fig trees and a big table and wicker chairs and a great market umbrella from Sienna, all gathered about an enormous pine, the biggest tree in the garden. She paused there a moment, looking absently at a growth of nasturtiums and iris tangled at its foot, as though sprung from a careless handful of seeds, listening to the plaints and accusations of some nursery squabble in the house. When this died away on the summer air, she walked on, between kaleidoscopic peonies massed in pink clouds, black and brown tulips and fragile mauve-stemmed roses, transparent like sugar flowers in a confectioner\u2019s window \u2014 until, as if the scherzo of color could reach no further intensity, it broke off suddenly in mid-air, and moist steps went down to a level five feet below.\u201dBut they didn\u2019t. And after part 1 of the book, which I quite liked, which at least promised more, parts 2 and 3 fell extremely flat; I was completely let down.Part 1 of the book was basically rich people in Paris and the French Riviera, having parties and going shopping. Everything seems perfect but on the surface you are aware that some things are waiting to reveal themselves.In part 2 we find out what\u2019s wrong and there is discussion of mental illness which I thought was quite candid and progressive for that time. Diver is a psychiatrist who is an admirer of Freud, so there is an interesting dialogue about psychology in this book. When we learn about how Diver met his wife, I was slightly disturbing, to be honest. Diver\u2019s character was the most complex and I\u2019m still not sure how I feel about him. He has a predilection towards young women and patients and although I felt this book was quite progressive seeing as it discussed mental health in the 1920s, I just couldn\u2019t, in the end, get past the superficial and superfluous characters."}, {"userName": "Duane", "userReviewDate": "Nov 25, 2013", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/24389390-duane", "userReview": "With the popularity of Fitzgerald, it's difficult to comprehend that he only wrote four novels, this being the last. It's a dark novel because it was written at a dark time in his life. Zelda's illness, financial problems, and alcoholism all contributed to Fitzgerald's frame of mind. I've read several negative reviews of this novel here on Goodreads saying it is depressing, the characters are shallow and unlikeable. That may be partly true, but their struggles and problems, their desires and betrayals, are what make them so compelling and so real. One has to take context into consideration when reading a novel, especially the time period when the novel was written and set. Also the mentality of this set of people and the lifestyle they lived is almost incomprehensible to the average person today. It was a great read for me. I give it 4.5 stars, I can't quite put it on the same level as The Great Gatsby."}, {"userName": "Michael Finocchiaro", "userReviewDate": "Jul 18, 2016", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/48483884-michael-finocchiaro", "userReview": "This was Fitzgerald's last book, the one after The Great Gatsby. It is extremely well-written and equally extremely depressing. There is murder and incest and the hapless Dick aimlessly looking for meaning in life and never quite finding it. It is definitely worth reading after you have finished Gatsby, but not recommended if you are already feeling blue because it will definitely not cheer you up. The language is superb though and therefore I gave it 4 stars."}, {"userName": "Pooja", "userReviewDate": "Nov 22, 2015", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/30059190-pooja", "userReview": "Tender is the night is the sad story of Nicole and Dick Diver's fall of marriage and in the end career after being such an ideal example of a wealthy and happy couple in front of the world.Their richness reminded me of Fitzgerald's other works like The Great Gatsby and The beautiful and Damned.I bought this book by mistaking it to The other side of Paradise by him, because I thought Charlie from Perks of Being Wallflower had this book in his read-list.I enjoyed reading this Jazz Era book and finding similarities between the characters and the writer's life, gave a chilling and thrilling kind of experience."}, {"userName": "Kim", "userReviewDate": "Oct 29, 2011", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/4542979-kim", "userReview": "In 1932, F Scott Fitgerald was living in suburban Baltimore. His father had recently died and his wife Zelda had been committed to a psychiatric institution in Switzerland. He finally decided that the novel on which he had been working on and off since the publication of The Great Gatsby in 1925 would be about the destruction of a man of great promise through an ill-judged marriage. In writing the novel, Fitzgerald liberally used material from his life. This material included his relationship with Zelda, their life together in France, the life-style of wealthy American expatriates Gerald and Sara Murphy, the death of his father, his alcoholism, what he had learned about psychiatry since Zelda had her first mental breakdown, and his despair at what he considered to be the waste of his potential as a writer. The novel which emerged from this extraordinarily difficult period in Fitzgerald's life is not easy to read. At first I thought I didn't want to keep reading, so little did I care about the characters and their concerns. However, when the narrative moved into flashback, detailing the circumstances leading up to the marriage of the central characters, Dick and Nicole Driver, I became interested in the narrative and that interest was sustained until the end.Knowing that this is the most autobiographical of Fitzgerald's works and understanding a little about the circumstances under which he wrote it adds poignancy to the reading experience. Fitzgerald clearly felt very sorry for himself, but from that self-pity was born a powerful and haunting novel."}, {"userName": "Pink", "userReviewDate": "Apr 05, 2017", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/14084605-pink", "userReview": "I have a lot of feelings about this book and about Scott and Zelda's relationship, which was the basis of this story. First of all, I think his writing is a mess. It's often in need of a good edit and here is no different. The chapters were shuffled around, looking for an order to make it work and finally settled with flashbacks, rather than a linear order. While I think that was the right decision, you can see that chapters could be chopped and changed and often read independently of one another. Perhaps this is a consequence of writing short stories and always having good snippets of a story, but never quite knowing how to link them all together. Of the essence of the novel, it's pure Scott and Zelda. So much so, that he reportedly stole sections of her own novel for this book, instead of passing it straight to the publishers, while she was being treated for manic depression. She often accused him of stealing ideas from her diaries throughout their marriage and true or not, he obviously used aspects of their life together. In Tender is the Night, we encounter heavy drinking, numerous affairs, furious rows and episodes of mental illness, all of which are well documented parts of their life. It's painfully intrusive, as we watch two broken people start to crack and for the first time, instead of turning to one another, they begin to drift apart. I think it's his best book, in all of it's rawness. Gatsby is a well constructed masterpiece, but this is the reality that came out of the other side."}, {"userName": "Gemma", "userReviewDate": "Jun 14, 2017", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/67746782-gemma", "userReview": "I remember a long time ago watching and loving the BBC series of this. It wasn\u2019t as good as the ITV adaptation of Brideshead Revisited but it\u2019s the only other TV book adaptation that has stayed with me from that period. Finally I read the novel. It\u2019s true it\u2019s a bit messy at the beginning \u2013 it took him more than ten years to write and he was often drunk during that period \u2013 but once people stop shooting each other and it sharpens into the story of the break up of Dick and Nicole\u2019s marriage it\u2019s just heartbreakingly beautiful.

So only naturally, I'm reluctant to read any other book by The Lost Generation, or at least, any by Fitzgerald. I know it's ridiculously assuming of me, but first impression makes all the differences and I'm oh so prejudiced.Ah, but the title is so, so beautiful. So I thought, why not giving it a go? It's only a fairly thin book anyway. At least it won't take long.Another mistake, it turned out. I think I won't ever read anything else by Mr. Fitzgerald. Yeah, sure, it is beautiful and everything, but I couldn't see the purpose of the whole thing: pointless parties, nonsense sentiments, gossips, judging other people to show off their classiness, verbiage\u2026 all those trivias serve what? At 30% I still had no idea what was happening. Ah, maybe that's the point: The Lost Generation is, using Sanderson's words, like a broken sword. It's very sharp, but lacking a point. Anyway, I refuse to like a discursive story. Every character laughed this moment and cried the next, without any excuse other than an inexplicable change of heart. I'd just call it schizophrenia.The story was bad enough, and then I just couldn't stand the style. Well I suppose that's what the whole Jazz Age fuss was about. Everything was supposed to be oh-so-French I could die on the spot. Live in the present, drink as if there's no tomorrow, party hard, be elegant and fashionable, everybody has swag!, things like that.

It's the story of one couple -- Dick and Nicole Diver; a charismatic American family living in France. They are charming, they are exceptional, they are fun, and of course, they are also flawed...and their tale is tragic. In short, this book is a classic and a joy to read. I'm always cautious about commenting on male writers writing female characters, especially those with mental disorders. But Nicole seems sympathetically and miraculously well-developed. Even though she is a kind of plague to the charismatic Dick Diver (I wonder what Freud would say about this character name), she also is a charming delight -- which makes Dick's situation all the more plausible and relatable. As the novel moves into its mature parts, we see that Dick himself is a kind of blight on Nicole. As Nicole gets better mentally and emotionally, Dick goes through a kind of dissipation. The very period-ness of the book, post-WWI Europe, the Jazz age, the backdrop of a rising and confident America, also makes the book interesting. In the edition I read, there are numbered references you can look up in the back that explain all the period details. The book is very much a work of its time, and thus, it's also a fascinating window into that part of history. One of the things that stands out the most is spectacular wealth that the Divers enjoy in their pre-Great Depression era lives. This is a subject I think that should resonate with modern America readers!The book was serialized (either in a newspaper or magazine, I forget), so the chapters are short, punchy, and something interesting happens in all of them. Since I read much of this on the bus to work, this structure of the book really worked for me. At first, as I read the book, I took it as just another well-written period piece. But the more involved I became with the Dick and Nicole, the more I began to see this book not just as a good work of fiction, but as a great one. It's the tale of a complicated time and place where good things can easily go sour. I would recommend this book to all lovers of great fiction! And, for this reason, I'm placing it on my all-time greats bookshelf."}, {"userName": "Perry", "userReviewDate": "May 26, 2016", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/6354112-perry", "userReview": "\"The grass, the thicket, and the fruit-tree wild....\"\n\"Ode to a Nightingale,\" KeatsDick Diver, a psychiatrist and writer in his late 30s with loads of potential, travels the fashionable places in France and Italy with his wife Nicole and a group of several other expat Americans. The novel's title was taken from a line in Keats' \"Ode to a Nightingale,\" which reflects on the fleetingness of pleasure and the certainty of death. The partly autobiographical novel was Fitzgerald's favorite and revolves around Diver's descent into full-blown alcoholism and a complete moral collapse after developing Florence Nightingale syndrome for, and marrying Nicole, his lovely and emotionally unbalanced patient. He further loses his way after an 18-year-old actress develops a crush on Dick. He falls for the enticement of youth and beauty, which is partly to blame for his wife beginning an affair with a young soldier. After the young actress jilts him and he's cuckolded by his wife, he begins drinking more heavily which only exacerbates his problems and further dooms his marriage and career.
