When I started reading this Novel I found that by the end of second chapter I was totally drawn into the story and was captivated by the characters and the premise of the story.The novel is set in the 1920s and 1970s in a trailer park in a small town in Canada and tells the story of 70 year old Addy Shadd.  A fellow neighbour Collette drops her 5 year old Sharla off with Addy and disappears. Addy reluctantly steps in as guardian to care for the child. The two form a tight bond and Sharla experiences unconditional love for the first time in her short life. At the same time, the young girl triggers Addy's childhood memories. These memories are full of hardships and trials. Memories of Addy's childhood days in Rusholme, a Canadian border town settled by runaway slaves in the 1800s come rushing back and carry the reader away. Addy recalls intimate details of her family, past lovers and the many people who loved and betrayed her.I really enjoyed the characters in this novel and fell totally in love with Addy. I felt the author did a fantastic job of making clear and precise transitions between the past and present and I never found myself getting lost in this fast paced novel. I think Lori Larsens does an excellent job of telling this tale and I love the sense of time and place that she creates.I found this book a really interesting and an easy read and would recommend it for anyone who enjoyed Novels such as The Kitchen House or The Help. I also recommend it to anyone who enjoys heartbreaking and yet a heartwarming tale."}, {"userName": "Linda", "userReviewDate": "Jun 22, 2010", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/234225-linda", "userReview": "This was one of those life-changing books. I felt like I got to know the main character, Addy, so well, that I missed her when I finished the book. What made this a memorable book for me was that the author was so good at painting scenes in many dimensions. The books centers around and old African American woman who grudgingly agrees to take in a ragamuffin white child who is homely and unwanted. Okay, the theme could be hackneyed but Lansens does such an outstanding job of telling the tale. As time passes, the woman grows fond of the child and the little girl blossoms into someone sweet and lovely. Again, we've heard that plot before. But again, Lansens' writing is so well crafted that it's like reading your first really good novel. The author also very creatively switches back from present tense to past tense and we learn of all the things (mostly sad) that happened along Addy's path that made her who she was as an old woman. But never is the sadness overwhelming. It's like Addy's strength and courage and simplicity buoy the reader. I'll say no more except that I think you should pick up this book and read it."}, {"userName": "Christine", "userReviewDate": "Jun 21, 2010", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/1473665-christine", "userReview": "I have a new author on my favourites list and this book was AMAZING! In my little world three stars out of five means it was a pretty good read \u2026 this book I would give six!The book is set in the Detroit-Windsor-Chatham corrider of Southern Ontario (as are most of Ms. Lansens books) and tells the story of Sharla Cody and Mum-Addy. Sharla is a five year old who has had a tough go of it already and Addy is a 70 year old who had a tough go of it all her life. Addy agrees to look after Sharla for the summer so her real mother can \u201cget her life together\u201d \u2026 which in reality meant \u201ctake off in the middle of the night with her boyfriend\". Having a young child in the house brings back memories of her own upbringing and causes Addy to go down memory lane a little more frequently than usual. Moving seamlessley from the present to the past, Addy\u2019s story is the book.Ms. Lansens manages to incorporate a lot of Canadiana into the book, from Canada\u2019a role in the anti-slavery movement, the underground railway and prohibition, but does so in a way that weaves well into the story. She also looks at the seedier side of children\u2019s lives when they do not have strong and loving parental figures. Although uplifting in the case of little Sharla, it makes me wish every needy child had an \u201cAddy\u201d in their lives.Addy is a character I quickly came to love, and that feeling kept me turning the pages to find out more about her remarkable life. A must read for anyone who likes a good story with (spoiler alert) a little bit of a tear-jerker ending."}, {"userName": "Mallory", "userReviewDate": "Aug 08, 2012", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/15153-mallory", "userReview": "There is no question in my mind that Lori Lansens is a strong writer with a lot of voice. She creates characters who you care about and want to know more about. After enjoying The Girls a great deal earlier this year, I was interested to read her first novel. Unfortunately, this novel falls flat and doesn't hold up to my expectations.The characters are interesting enough, but the storyline is at best predictable and at worst contrived. There are moments that are genuinely touching interspersed with others that are emotionally manipulative. And while I like both Addy and Sharla, I wish there had been more character development; they sometimes threaten to leap off the page, but never quite manage to do so.I wasn't sure if I should tear up or roll my eyes at the trite yet satisfying ending, so I let one well and rolled the other. People on the beach thought I was having a stroke.Overall, a quick, decent read but lacking the emotional depth I had hoped after liking The Girls so much. It's a first novel and it reads like one--when it's not reading like a movie of the week--but Lansens has talent and I'll continue to look for her work in the future."}, {"userName": "Cupcakencorset", "userReviewDate": "May 03, 2012", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/4313474-cupcakencorset", "userReview": "Such a good book! Set in both the 1930s and the 1990s, this rich literary novel tells the story of Addy Shadd, a black woman in the Great Lakes region of Canada and the U.S., starting with the violent disruption of her nearly idyllic life as a teenager in Rusholme. Rusholme was the end of a line on the Underground Railroad and had become one of the few places where blacks owned property and lived outside most of the prejudice and discrimination of the pre-civil-rights era. A pregnant Addy is forced out of her home at 15 years of age and has to make her way in a world that is at best unsympathetic to her plight.As an old woman, Addy takes in Sharla Cody, a biracial 5-year-old neighbor whose mother abandons the girl in the trailer park where they all live. Sharla\u2019s life has included little discipline, little love and little happiness. Their life together isn\u2019t smooth, and the world is no more sympathetic than when Addy was young, but they find in each other a measure of solace.Rush Home Road is rich and evocative, with details that bring to life two worlds that I had never imagined. Lansens uses language like a painter, drawing and coloring her Addy and Sharla vividly, lovingly, but with little sentimentality. They become real people, damaged and resigned to make the best of their situations, however precarious they know them to be.I don\u2019t know quite how Lansens was able to get into the minds of two people so different from her (and from me), but she did\u2026 and she got into my heart at the same time."}, {"userName": "Sarah Obsesses over Books & Cookies", "userReviewDate": "Jul 29, 2015", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/2070861-sarah-obsesses-over-books-cookies", "userReview": "This is one of those novels that just reads and reads and reads. It reminded me of Jane Eyre but easier. I thought it would be more about the girl, Sharla but it was truly about Adalaide \"Addy\" Shadd. Sharla's mom is trash. She decides she doesn't want her 6 year old anymore so she goes around the trailer park seeing who will take her for the summer since her boyfriend gets annoyed when she's around. Addy says yes and then bit by bit (each chapter is an alternating POV between Sharla and Addy) we find out Addy's tale of growing up. And much like Jane Eyre Addy is goes off at a young age (but Jane wasn't raped) and by coincidence, or by God Addy meets people who are unlikely helpers. The story takes place in Canada and US in the early 1900's and late 1970's. I was totally enthralled. I haven't read a book this engaging in a long time. And the coolest part for me is that i hadn't heard of the author and she has a couple more books. This is a book about love- for Addy had a first love and a real love. it's about family- Sharla wants her mother but loves \"mum addy\" too. About regretting the past and forgiving your parents and even though the author throws in some typical situations (rape, pregnancy, seeming infidelity etc) it isn't forced or corny."}, {"userName": "Elizabeth", "userReviewDate": "May 12, 2009", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/2313536-elizabeth", "userReview": "I first remember opening this book in the store and reading the first paragraph. From that first paragraph I was hooked. I knew that it was going to be good but I still had my doubts about the storyline. I continued reading later on that night and I couldn't stop. I was younger at that time so it took me a few days to read. I was incredulous at the way the whole town acted towards Addy. The hate, betrayal, and abhorrence just came out without questioning what really happened to her. I loved following her through her past and present at the same time caring for little Sharla Cody. I was able to see her face her problems of love, rape, acceptance and the strength she had to make it through it all.I learned that life isn't perfect and there are always going to be times when life takes a turn for the worst but you shouldn't let it control your life. The best thing you could ever do is try to make the best of it and move on."}, {"userName": "Carole", "userReviewDate": "Jan 20, 2014", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/7630646-carole", "userReview": "I bought this book a few years back. It sat on my shelf after I read the first few pages and put it down for the bad language/swearing. Here, on Goodreads I saw some of my trusted friends gave it good reviews. I'm so glad I gave it a second chance...it was a fabulous, heart touching, sweet read. The story went back and forth from present day and the lives of Sharla & Addy to the days of Addy's childhood. I love books like this one, of people unselfishly helping others less fortunate. (the bad language at the start was just a way of describing the family and their lifestyle of the little girl who was abandoned) there was a little sexuality.

There are many interesting characters in Addy Shadd\u2019s story. Addy herself showed resilience, compassion and forgiveness throughout her experiences and did so with a sense of dignity. It was a very sad story in places, both for Addy and Sharla. There were a few twists thrown in that I didn\u2019t expect. Overall, a very good, heart touching story.

I leave those to my sweet friends Eleanor and SuziQOregon. In spite of that, this is a book that deserves an attempt at a review for my friends who read.Books that start with old people and flash back to their earlier lives will always capture my attention. Addy Shadd not only captured me, but touched something a little deeper while reading her story in this book. As I turned the last page and closed the book, I was surprised to discover tears on my cheeks.Addy is 70+ years old and an unrelated child, 5-year-old Sharla Cody, is dumped on her doorstep for the summer. Soon the summer becomes forever. Unloved Sharla becomes a beloved child. Lonely Addy becomes more than she thought she would at her age. Of course their lives are dramatically changed. Circumstances would demand they must.The flashbacks to Addy's life are detailed with joy and sorrow.

Addy Shadd has got to be one of the greatest characters written in fiction. She has been through so much in her life and yet has survived with an amazing outlook on life, and she passes her wisdom on to Sharla, a 5 year old who is foisted on her. The story switches between Addy's back story and the current situation between Addy and Sharla. Both are related with compassion but in unflinching detail. Neither had an easy life. This is a book that you don't want to end. It's hard to believe that this is a first novel for Lori Lansens. I loved \"The Girls\".

If I hadn't had so many things going on in my life I very much would have read this in one sitting. I fell in love with the characters and the story line as well.

Sometimes I have trouble with the alternating story lines, but Lansens worked it perfectly in this book, in my opinion. I definitely recommend this book to everyone!

Here the most vulnerable members of society eke out the barest of existences, alternatively sustaining and denigrating their equally impoverished neighbours.It is easier to be brave if you possess good health, youth and vigor. The hero of this book has lost these attributes but still finds the courage to change the life of another human. Not only does the little fat abandoned girl she embraces draw on her current depleted stocks of energy and funds but also muddles her mind as she relives the brutality and circumstance that she has endured over her own lifetime.Grief not edged with bitterness is a rare commodity. Addy Shadd as a child had experienced betrayal, disappointment and grief very early in her life. She was a person without malice who loved and lost many times over. Her brother who misguidedly sacrificed his young life to preserve some vestige of honour for Addy, his sister, lived on in her mind and constantly talked with and advised her. Towards the end of her life, as she gradually slipped away from reality, the influence of these figures in her mind grew stronger.I admired the way love and trust developed between the old woman and the girl. Each recognised in the other a kindred dispossessed soul. Each had been discarded by the very people they most needed and yet had the courage to love again.This is a tale of devotion, neglect and heartbreak. It has an element of ultimate homecoming, spiritual for Addy and physical for Sharla. It is a story of loss and hardship but through the twisted wrecks of lives the reader can clearly distinguish the ringing bell of hope resounding for a better future.

It is both a heartbreaking and heartwarming story at the same time, that focuses on the lives of Addy and Sharla. It moves effortlessly between the story of Addy who because of a terrible incident and a thoughtless community must leave home as a young pregnant teenager. Addy now elderly and living alone, has Sharla a 5 year old neglected/abused child abandoned on her door step. The start of the book had me in tears for this poor child. Every child should have an Addy in their life. As Addy nutures and loves Sharla the story weaves between the life they create together and the past that shaped them.Situated in the Detroit-Chatham corridor, the underground railway, the settling of the Dresden area by escaped slaves coming north is the backdrop to a story that speaks to class, race and age.Yes, of course some of the storyline is over the top, but I'm a sucker every time for stories of hope and the idea of overcoming pain and loss. It is a beautifully written story about the resilience of the human spirit, about seeing the flaws but also the possibilities.The author has a wonderful writing style that drew me in and brought the characters alive immediately. I could not put the book down and I will miss Addy and Sharla."}, {"userName": "L", "userReviewDate": "Jan 20, 2016", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/1156396-l", "userReview": "This is a tale of loss, family (including what that means), small-town judgements, injustice and struggles (both large and small) against injustice, the indomitable human spirit, and, mostly, love. It includes religious and not so religious people, African-Canadian and white, some of them bootleggers. People move back and forth between Canada and the States, specifically Detroit. Addy has had a hard life, a very hard life. Yet, somehow, she keeps going. A strange little girl is thrust into Addy's life, near the end of that life. The book revolves around their grandmother/granddaughter-like relationship, as Addy moves back and forth between the present and her past, remembering, making sense of the whole and fulfilling her responsibility to the child. Although pain is woven throughout this story, love ties it all together. While things work out perhaps a little too well in some cases to allow a reader to suspend disbelief, the story has so much heart the reader can look past this. After all, some people truly do persevere and find meaning in most every situation and relationship."}, {"userName": "Andrea Paterson", "userReviewDate": "Feb 04, 2011", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/4904968-andrea-paterson", "userReview": "While many books have made me ache while confronting the sorrow and the beauty of the world, rarely do books make me cry openly and fully. This book did that. Lansens has written a heartbreaking story of loss and redemption with just enough love for the reader to grasp onto like a raft in turbulent water. The protagonist Addy Shadd draws you into her world and, as if you are a child like Sharla yourself, teaches you the value of forgiveness as well as \"how to live simply and simply live.\" Lansens infuses her book with vivid scents--pie crusts, strawberries warm in the summer sun, sweat, death, decay, and the algae green smell of Lake Erie. The world she fashions is so close you can almost taste it. She brings you to the brink of human cruelty only to pull back into love--love that is flawed, human, often tragic, but nonetheless love that heals. I would recommend this to anyone who has ever wondered how to get home."}, {"userName": "Lisa", "userReviewDate": "Jul 23, 2013", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/5354701-lisa", "userReview": "One of the best books I've read in a long time and when I turned the last page this afternoon, I was sad that it ended.

The story is rich in feeling and detail, telling the story alternating between flashbacks of Addy's childhood in Rusholme, her journey to adulthood, and her current life with Sharla Cody, the young girl. I admired Addy's strength and perseverance, her relationships with each character in the book, and the author's writing style. As a fan of history, I also enjoyed the story for it's historical tone.

The story is told through the memories of 70 year old Addy who lives on a trailer park and is left to look after a little girl for the summer after she is abandoned by her abusive mother. Sharla Cody's mother was wicked and I found the abuse moments very uncomfortable and hard to read. This is a small part of the book so dont let it put you off.
