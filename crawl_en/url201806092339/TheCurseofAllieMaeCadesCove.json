It (and it's sequel) were free for Kindle. It was great. This may have been the scariest book I have ever read. I have read over twenty Stephen King books but this one is far scarier than any of King's that I have read. This is also a great read for anyone who is familiar with eastern TN. It is very well written and the creepiness starts almost at the beginning. If you want a genuinely scary book, give it a shot."}, {"userName": "Cynthia", "userReviewDate": "May 27, 2012", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/7802158-cynthia", "userReview": "I love any books set in the southern Appalachians, and this one did not disappoint. In many ways it reminded me of the \"Ballad Novels\" by Sharyn McCrumb, with old legends or events overlapping with current times. In this case they did more than overlap, the old event became a current manifestation of the past. While vacationing in the Smokey Mountains of eastern Tennessee, David and Miriam Hobbs take one day to visit a little-seen ravine in Cade's Cove where a small keepsake bag is found. Instead of turning it in at the visitor center as a possible artifact, David is compelled to take it home with him to Denver. Unfortunately, as a result of this decision, they take home something much more malevolent. Without spoiling the story, after many different tries the spirit is finally put to rest.Or is it? As part one of \"The Cade's Cove\" series we can be assured that there was more to the haunting, and the worst may still be to come. Personally I'm looking forward to reading the next installment and I hope many of the cast of characters will be back from book one."}, {"userName": "Margaret McCullough", "userReviewDate": "Jan 16, 2012", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/5541422-margaret-mccullough", "userReview": "Loved it!! It was fun reading about an area that I am familiar with. It totally makes me want to visit Cades Cove again soon. The characters are so well written they could be your next door neighbors. While reading, I found myself experiencing a plethora of emotions... sadness, affection, sorrow, fear, suspense, anger, contempt, happiness, and sheer joy for spending time with such a wonderful book. I also loved how Indian folklore was woven into the story. Hoping to read more of that in the next book, which I *cannot* wait to read. Although I might wait a bit since the 3rd book won't be coming out til 2013. Can ya write a little faster Aiden?? :-) I'm looking forward to reading more of this author's books."}, {"userName": "Michelle Wright", "userReviewDate": "Apr 16, 2012", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/8136530-michelle-wright", "userReview": "This is an amazing book creepy yes..very and a real page turner.I love Aiden's style and he certainly captured me in this thriller of a story!"}, {"userName": "Jayne Bowers", "userReviewDate": "Sep 04, 2012", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/1379567-jayne-bowers", "userReview": "This book is one of a series and is entitled Cades Cove: The Curse of Allie Mae. The story line is that of a young girl, Allie Mae, whose angry spirit comes to terrorize the Hobbs family after the parents, David and Miriam, have a romantic interlude in a Cades Cove ravine. While there, they find a small bag stitched with \u201cAllie Mae\u2019s Treasures,\u201d and despite David\u2019s intention of turning it in to the park authorities, he finds himself unable to do so. That\u2019s where the \u201cfun\u201d begins. Allie Mae recognizes David\u2019s resemblance to her ruthless attacker, and thus begins to seek revenge on him, his family, and his best friend. Desperate for relief, David returns to the park to personally return Allie Mae\u2019s bag, and that\u2019s when he meets John, a ranger and Cherokee Indian, and John\u2019s granddaughter Evelyn. Knowledgeable about spirits, incantations, herbs, and rituals, John and Evelyn set about to free David from Allie Mae\u2019s spirit. Are they successful?

I can't seem to just give up on it, but it is excruciatingly painful. I have no idea how it's gotten such good reviews. The author apparently has no idea how grammar works. And he insists on narrating every move each character takes. If they step from the kitchen into the livingroom he has to tell you where they ended up standing. It's like reading stage directions. And if one more person smirks or snickers, I will spontaneously combust. **************Finally finished. It remained horrifically bad, with the exception of one section that I suspect someone re-wrote for him. The vast majority of the book was full of run-on sentences, fragments, and just basic terrible structure - sins obviously committed out of ignorance and not for creative effect. For example, \"Surprised that the camera wasn't broken, his prized lens received a mere scratch on its black casing.\"It was a fairly interesting story which could not stand up against the clunky, undeveloped and painfully amateurish writing."}, {"userName": "Dana", "userReviewDate": "May 29, 2012", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/8351940-dana", "userReview": "Cades Cove is the Scariest book I have read in a very very long time... a pure terrorizing Ghost Story!

I loved the descriptions that he gave about the area. The details that he gave us about Allie Mae and her anger were outstanding. I had to make a trip to that area while reading this book and honestly felt the hair stand up on the back of my neck just for seeing a sign pointing towards Cades Cove.

The protagonist stumbles across a mystery 100 years old and blah, blah, blah\u2026it\u2019s stupid. The dialog is totally unoriginal. The main characters seem to be talking to each other in sound bites from a bad movie trailer and I wanted to pull my hair out. It was all, \u201cLove you, babe.\u201d \u201cLove you too, babe. I\u2019m afraid of the evil in our house.\u201d \u201cI know, babe. I\u2019ll get to the bottom of this.\u201d \u201cOkay. I love you, babe.\u201dPuke. The characters themselves were incredibly flat and while the concept behind the plotline was good, that was about all I can say that\u2019s positive. Not only that, but the plot was incredibly repetitive. How repetitive? Twice I lost my spot when I stopped reading and when I came back to it, it took me awhile to realize I was in the wrong place. That repetitive. I kept reading because I really wanted things to get better. I think I may have paid attention somewhere near the end, but it\u2019s hard to say because I was bored most of the time. In short, don\u2019t waste your time. This was a free book I downloaded for my Kindle, and I deleted it from my library so it wouldn\u2019t take up precious space. I know, Kindles can hold something like 3,000 books, but I didn\u2019t want to risk it."}, {"userName": "Donna Thompson", "userReviewDate": "Mar 15, 2012", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/7337222-donna-thompson", "userReview": "Although the premise isn't extremely original, Mr. James manages to infuse his story with enough twists, turns and chills to give it a fresh feel.

Then Aiden James' Cades Cove is the book for you.A couple head to the mountains near Gatlinburg, Tennessee to strengthen their marriage and bring a spark back to it. While in Cades Cove, they discover a pouch of trinkets and a partially written name on a tree. That night, noises are heard in the house. The odd happenings follow them home to Colorado where the noises turn into something much more dangerous. Now their lives are in danger as a murdered girl from years ago is out to get revenge.First off, I do not like scary stories. I don't like horror. Why then did I read this book? I'll have to admit that it wasn't the cover, the description, or the title. It was the fact that I had read three other books by Aiden James that I just loved. That led me to Cades Cove which I had gotten during a free giveaway but that doesn't mean I'll read it. I can always delete a book. But being an Aiden James' book I just had to read it. Now saying that.....This book kept me completely riveted. I had to finish it. I had to know what was happening and why. I couldn't read it at night as the first night I tried I had bad dreams that kept me up all night. I finished it the next day to avoid having to wait another day. Mr. James writes in a manner that captivates you and doesn't let you go. I felt like I was experiencing the ghostly encounters. Mr. James made it extremely real.There is no gore in this book. It is not really bloody at all. There is blood but it generally just appears. There is violence and of course the terror of a dead witch. This is not a book for those that don't like to get scared. There are a couple of scenes that are explicit with language, but overall this was not throughout the whole book which I appreciate.The plot is catching and doesn't let you go. It is written in a manner that never lets you take a breath. It never lets you rest. You are always on the guard to what the ghost will do next. I could easily see this as a movie.Do you like scary stories? Do you like suspense? Do you like a book that keeps you until the end? Then this is the book for you. Trust me, you will enjoy it. Though the ending drove me nuts. I'm still debating the sequel.Note: This book was purchased by me during a free giveaway online."}, {"userName": "Marti", "userReviewDate": "Apr 08, 2012", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/7224922-marti", "userReview": "I'll stack up to the \"well at least I got what I paid for\" pile. It was a free download, actually a group of 3 books and I liked the other 2 in the package fairly well. At least all I lost was time, but it was a fair amount of time because this book was long. Some of the characters were reasonably well developed but not as much as I would have liked, especially since this was a fairly long book. The author pretty much put all of his energy into plot and even the plot got rather repetitive. It's a ghost story with the ghost being malevolent, even murderous but the reader does at last get to find out where much of that anger comes from. The editing was very poor, with homonym errors and quite a variety of grammatical errors. While I can get around it, I find that kind of sloppiness aggravating. The basic premise is that David, a CPA, and Miriam, a pediatrician take a short vacation from their home in Colorado to the Smoky Mountains to celebrate their 15th wedding anniversary and attempt to rekindle their romance. While on vacation, they climb up to Cades Cove, which is a secluded area and find a little bag that looks very old. Miriam wants David to return the bag and he agrees but can't make himself do it. For the rest of the story, this bag, which is tied to the ghost Allie Mae, looms large. This was a book that should have stopped a few hundred words before it actually did. It seemed to have come to a satisfactory conclusion, but then the author kept going. I thought perhaps it was a rather cheesy way to set up a sequell, but at least I didn't see one hawked on the end pages. I would not particularly recommend this book."}, {"userName": "Jody Mabry", "userReviewDate": "May 26, 2015", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/27310823-jody-mabry", "userReview": "I enjoyed the book and had some chills while Allie Mae went on her ghostly tirades. Also enjoyed the link to Allie Mae and main characters at the end. My one critique would be that subplot loose ends were all tied together at the end in a short scene, and nearly dismissed throughout the book. As a reader this didn't involve me in the book in trying to solve the mystery. I was at the whim of the writer to tell me what was happening. Also, the murder of the protagonists friend was seemingly lost as a subplot and didn't come back often enough to care. If it were taken out, the story would not change.Overall it was a good ghost story with believable characters, a mysterious backdrop, and fun historical context."}, {"userName": "S.

I probably liked it a lot more than normal because I ended up reading most of it during a blackout, and there is nothing better than being snuggled under the covers with a flashlight and a ghost story. Granted, the dialog wasn't the best, but it really wasn't the worst I've ever read.The plot is very basic: a couple becomes haunted by a vengeful spirit after taking a small bag that belonged to the ghost. However, the people in the family are not who the ghost thinks they are. I loved how Allie Mae haunted them, it was really perfect and creepy at times. I actually enjoyed the characters of John Running Deer and his granddaughter more than the family involved, so I'm really excited that book two seems to focus more on them."}, {"userName": "Greg", "userReviewDate": "Mar 19, 2012", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/8211896-greg", "userReview": "An artifact taken from a secluded valley in the Smokey Mountains during a weekend getaway causes disturbing consequences.
