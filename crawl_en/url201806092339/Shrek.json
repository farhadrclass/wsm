William Steig\u2019s illustrations are truly beautiful and hilarious especially of the images of Shrek himself as he has a green and warty face, a purple shirt and yellow and green striped pants, which make him, look more hilarious than menacing. I also love the images of the trees in this book as they look simplistic yet beautiful, giving this book a somewhat simplistic tone. William Steig makes this story extremely hilarious and full of attitude as Shrek is a character who loves being repulsive and scaring off innocent bystanders, but at the same time, he gives a powerful message to the audience about loving yourself as Shrek loves his own repulsiveness, even if other people do not like his repulsiveness. William Steig makes this book extremely unique as it was one of the few books to have a repulsive character as the main character of the story.Parents should know that this book does contain the word jack--- and that might offend many parents who do not want their children learning such a word. Even though jack--- is used to describe a donkey in this book, the way that the \u201ca\u201d word is being used now might confuse smaller children and might even entice them to say the word so often. Also, another con of this book is that, in my opinion, it was not as memorable as the movie which is why I gave it a four star rating. Shrek seem more repulsive in this book than he was in the movie and that aspect of his character sort of made him a less likable character in the book, while in the movie, Shrek was a more benevolent ogre who was upset at the way that people treated him and that made him a very likable character in the movie. Also, I felt like the character development was not as strong in this book as it was in the movie and the audience might not feel any kind of bond towards the characters in this book.\u201cShrek!\u201d is a great book for children about the importance of being yourself no matter what other people think, but the movie might be a better choice about learning this message since the movie developed the characters much better than this book could. I would recommend this book to children ages six and up due to the use of the word jack---.Review is also on: Rabbit Ears Book Blog"}, {"userName": "Kathryn", "userReviewDate": "Sep 21, 2011", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/446464-kathryn", "userReview": "This is about the delightfully dreadful Shrek--the ORIGINAL Shrek. Yes, Shrek is a hideous and vastly unpleasant (and stinky!) ogre, yes there is a donkey, and yes there is an (ugly) princess waiting to be rescued. But, the similarities between the movie end there. This is basically the tale of how Shrek goes around causing havoc, delighting in disgusting people, once he is (literally) kicked out out of the house, er, hole in the ground, by his parents. When he meets a witch who gives him a prophecy, he decides to accept the quest and go find the monstrous princess. The illustrations are (purposely) repulsive, but they certainly do reflect the story well! I feel they are a bit juvenile in style, reminding me of a child's crayon drawings, but I think this is intentional. SPOILERS: I can certainly see why they made the movie Shrek a bit more loveable and capable of change and doing good. The Shrek in this story is not exactly heroic, though he does get the girl and lives happily ever after (as they terrorize others). Still, I found the stortelling oddly beguiling and, while not my usual cup of tea, it makes a great choice for Halloween or monster-themed reading."}, {"userName": "Reddish", "userReviewDate": "Apr 20, 2015", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/7392666-reddish", "userReview": "Desde que vi la primera pel\u00edcula de Shrek, \u00e9ste siempre ha sido uno de mis personajes favoritos de la animaci\u00f3n.

A film that has made countless sequels and spinoffs and you would think that the book provided enough material to make a feature animated film but you want to know the honest truth... the movie was better than the book!!!!!I found this book to be bland, the illustrations to be weak, and not much of plot. I have to congratulate Steven Spielberg for having that magnificent vision to look past the book and help create a fantasy world that both is humorous and entertaining. We meet Shrek who is this awful smelly ogre. In this book we discover that he has parents that are awful and provide a wonderful life until he is an adult and wants to pursue his own journey. Shrek later meets a witch who tells him of his destiny that he will meet a talking donkey who will escort him to fight off a knight and end up following a quest to meet a princess who is even uglier than him. Shrek cannot believe this nonsense but nonetheless the prophecy comes true. The movie has a similar plot but I love the idea that Fiona who doesn't have a name in the book was a beautiful princess who suffered from a terrible curse instead of this hideous monster who was born that way. Would I highly recommend people to read this book? HELL TO THE NO!Even if you worship the Shrek movies I believe this book will not enhance your experience with Shrek and instead may make you become outrage that this book is nothing compared to the movie. It is crazy how time flies by, I remember vividly going to the theaters to see Shrek and absolutely loved the first movie and then for some apparent reason I hated the sequel as a child until finally I marathon the entire series to see the final film. I believe the Shrek films were spectacular until the 3rd movie. I believe they should have taken their time and figure out better stories to tell on screen instead of riding the high of making millions to the bank without any care about owing the fans and viewers a phenomenal series. I hope in the future if they ever decide to make another Shrek film that they forget the sequels and make the next one action pack and bring back the love I had for the first film.

We bought it for daughter #2 (who came 14 years after #1; we have a large family, laden with sons). It is amusing in that it shows that not only fashion models, Cinderellas, and Barbie dolls get to find true love. Shrek is not depicted as a dandy guy with a few cosmetic issues. He chortles as the flowers wilt when they see him coming. This is a very funny book, but because those who are less lovely are shown as being antithetical to nature itself, I withheld the fifth star. Bear in mind that this might just be me being a curmudgeon, because if I had it to do over again, I would still buy this book.Steig has a way of incorporating amusing little details that keep the adult interested as they read to their child. And we do want to read to them; it's so important for their vocabulary development. If your wallet is running dry, the local library almost always carries a full complement of Steig titles. We also tend to go heavy on books at Christmas, and as long as there is something else along with them that was desired, the kids have always been pleased, and put titles on their lists.If yours is a more reluctant reader, this may be a tonic. (On the face of it, you would perhaps see it as a boy's book, but bear in mind, the dude is going to fall in love. You know your child/ren, so figure it out; would this work for one of yours?).When it came time to winnow away the picture books, giving the scruffy ones to charity and the nicer ones and duplicates (yes, duplicates...I do have five kids!) this is one that stayed.

He wreaks havoc. He is very happy with his ugliness and how everyone responds to him (he has high self-esteem). He meets a witch who prophesies to him and tells him what to do. He follows the prophecy (which includes meeting a donkey that will give him a ride), wreaking more havoc on the way, and it (the prophecy) is fulfilled exactly. Shrek marries the ugly princess at the end of the book. There are no surprises, plot-wise. There may be surprises about Shrek's abilities (for instance, he can breath fire and shoot beams out of his eyes), however.Comparing this with the movie, they only have these few things in common:\u2022 There's a personage named Shrek (although it never specifies he's an ogre)\u2022 Shrek looks similar (not the same); he's green (pretty much the same shade), has the alien-style ear-things and is of a similar build\u2022 There is reference to how Shrek smells awful (although it is a very brief reference in the book, when the flowers and trees lean away from him)\u2022 Shrek meets a talking donkey that irritates and helps him\u2022 There's a princess Shrek marries (however, she's ugly all the time instead of part of the time, and it never says she's an ogre; it never says she's under a spell)There are lots of differences, however.Anyway, it's good to see the inspiration."}, {"userName": "Selina", "userReviewDate": "Oct 21, 2014", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/34307128-selina", "userReview": "In the picture book Shrek, the main character Shrek who is very ugly is on a mission to find a princess who turns out to be uglier than he is.

They are very graphic and not appealing. I also didn\u2019t really feel that the text followed to story line well. The text also was a little vulgar for a children\u2019s book.

I don\u2019t feel that this book that I would read in a classroom for this reason, that some children may understand certain words that others do not. The humor however in this book is constant.
