I opened the book, was entranced by the photos, the history of the region and the recipes themselves. I'm lost for choice in deciding which one to choose!

Yotam Ottolenghi is an Israeli Jew of Italian and German heritage, Sami Tamimi is an Israeli Arab. They were both born and raised in Jerusalem - Ottolenghi in Jewish West Jerusalem and Tamimi in Muslim East Jerusalem - and became friends and business partners in London. In this book, they return to the food of their Jerusalem childhoods and explore the food of the city today, both traditional and modern. I love their recipes, just as I love the recipes in their previous jointly authored cookbook Ottolenghi: The Cookbook and Ottolenghi's solo effort, Plenty. Their food is colourful and bold, the flavours strong and the ingredients used imaginatively. It's the kind of food that I could eat every day and that I cook, well, not every day, but very regularly.I recently watched a documentary called Jerusalem on a Plate, which was made prior to the publication of this cookbook. In it, Yotam Ottolenghi shows the food traditions of Jerusalem, talking to and eating with Jews and Arabs, in family homes, restaurants and on the street. It's so much more than just a cooking program and makes for inspirational and moving viewing. I've also read this article from Haaretz, which depressingly illustrates the fact that Yotam Ottolenghi and Sami Hamimi's dream of bringing together Jews and Arabs through their shared culinary traditions and the food they love is unlikely to be achieved any time soon."}, {"userName": "Helen", "userReviewDate": "Nov 27, 2012", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/2429268-helen", "userReview": "I just received this magnificent book as a birthday present, and I'm loving every single page of it. These are the foods I lived on during my year in Israel. As I read along, I'm tasting every dish on the tip of my tongue. So far, I've made the Israeli salad, the shakshuka, and the chicken with caramelized onions and cardamom rice, and they're all so good that I want to compose a psalm about them.There are lots of Middle-Eastern recipe books. What is different here, what is unique and special and to be treasured, is that this one comes from two Jerusalemites, Yotam Ottolenghi and Sami Tamimi, one of them Jewish, and one of them Palestinian.The photography is magnificent, to be sure. Jumbo glossy shots of fresh-picked, just-cooked, locally-grown ingredients, looking colorful and steamy and delicious, with handfuls of parsley scattered across the plates. And I'm not just talking about the pictures of food. The ancient walled city of Jerusalem stars here too, with pictures of the glorious covered shuk, cheerfully gnarled old men standing in their market booths, or sitting in cafes playing endless games of sheshbesh. The text is more than just recipes. Generous and forgiving, willing to squabble good-humoredly over the origins of a particular dish, the writing is suffused with a spirit of cooperation, a love of the land, family, comfort and cuisine. There is something going on here besides talking about food. You might say it's a recipe for peace."}, {"userName": "Adam", "userReviewDate": "Aug 03, 2013", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/1884982-adam", "userReview": "This book is magnificent. Jerusalem collects the recipes of Jewish, Israeli Jerusalem and those of Muslim/Christian Arab-Israeli/Palestinian Jerusalem. One chef is Jewish, the other Palestinian. The lines blur, a fact the writers acknowledge. Few of these dishes have a permanent home. Many have origins far away. Some, the most famous (falafel, hummus), belong originally to neither side. By now, they belong to both. Much more important is that the diverse ethnic backgrounds of both Jewish and Arab Israelis make the food real interesting. Some of the Palestinian dishes are pure Mediterrranea. Others clearly would've come to Palestine with migrant Arab peasants, and are more reminiscent of food found in Iraq, for example, than Mediterranean food in general. On the Jewish side, some dishes here come from Ashkenazi origin, combining European and Jewish traditions with kashrut requirements. Some dishes come from Central Asian Jewish origin, like the simple rice and chicken dish that is one of the highlights of the book. Some others come from Mizrahi Jewish origin, reflecting a pre-Israel combination of Arab and Jewish traditions. Still others, perhaps some of the best, are of Sephardic Jewish origin and taste of Southern Europe and North Africa. If this were Chopped, the Palestinians would win the dessert round easily. And they shouldn't. Fucking fenugreek semolina cake (helbeh) has no goddamn right being any good. But it is. So, so good. I know this food. I've eaten a lot of this sorta stuff and it's rarely been as delicious as it is with these recipes as a foundation. In a world where it's difficult finding serious food from this(these) cuisine(s) [not that there's anything wrong with shawarma; that's gotta be one of the most perfect creations known to humanity], this book is a godsend. And it's kinda necessary. Before this came out, this sort of food was woefully underexposed. It still is. But why? Politics? Racism and anti-semitism combined? Alright, that is admittedly a bit of a tinfoil-hat thing to say. But it's seriously hard to figure out. This is not just good food. It's accessible! It's easy to make and it's fucking delicious! It's not especially demanding, like Japanese food or certain sorts of French cooking or whatever this molecular gastronomy thing people are doing are. I love Japanese food. Everyone does. But the average person will never do what the chefs in Japan do and can never do it. In North America, just finding the ingredients is a huge impediment. And it's not challenging to the North American palate, like a lot of actual European, East Asian and Southeast Asian food is (I am not referring to steak frites and green curry here). So really: ????I'm not a cookbook guy, so I don't really know how to judge this relative to other cookbooks. I don't have a pile of them. I don't consult them very often except to check that I'm not fucking shit up when trying to make something new to me. But I know that these recipes are authentic and inventive and purely fucking excellent.This is probably the first cookbook I've read all the way through, and made many of the recipes found within. It won't be the last, because I'm beginning to understand the economic stupidity of eating out as often as I do."}, {"userName": "Terri", "userReviewDate": "Jan 12, 2013", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/1968826-terri", "userReview": "This is the kind of cookbook I could reach for again and again. There is plenty to read in relation to the food, environment and culture as well as ample recipes that I can use on a weekly basis. In fact some of the recipes were already familiar to me and show up on the dinner table frequently, such as Butternut Pumpkin, Haloumi, Pine Nut 'hot salad' type recipes.Living in a hot climate myself I found the fresh food of Jerusalem appealing and have already copied a few recipes down as this is a library book and has to go back.I like the authors use of yoghurt in sauces instead of cream and have long subscribed to the belief that yoghurt, if treated right and not overcooked which causes it to curdle, is a delicious ingredient to use for a lower fat alternative to cream or sour cream in things like sauces, dressings and toppings. It was nice to see some more recipes with yoghurt to add to my repertoire.Jerusalem is an excellent book which I highly recommend to all."}, {"userName": "Alison", "userReviewDate": "Oct 18, 2012", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/12659139-alison", "userReview": "Another fantastic Ottolenghi book made even better by the poignant stories he and Sami Tamimi share about growing up in different communities in the same city.

I left it on there through the browning of the chicken and the rice cooking, but I would recommend clearing/scraping the pan after each step. It didn't chip off into the food, whew. It was just very difficult to scour off afterwards.2) I think the basmati rice was supposed to be fluffy, but I used a pan that was larger than my burner. The rice in the middle was done while the edge rice was still crunchy. I added more water and cooking time which resulted in the sticky and mushy rice instead of delightful fluff. Matching burner to pan would've helped. Cooking the rice separatly would also help, although possibly end up being less delicious?3) I trimmed off the thickest of the fatty skin, which resulted in the remaining skin being pathetic shrunken patches. Leave the fat and all the skin on! It will render out and the step to wipe out the pan will also allow for pouring off the excess fat.\"**This was delicious but it was fucking expensive -- called for about $15 of lamb, and herbs $2/bunch. I used dried thyme instead of fresh. By the time 3 batches of meat were seared, the fond was closer to burned than I would have liked, so while the directions say to just wipe out the pan after searing the meat and before cooking the shallots, I took it to the sink and gave it a full wash.***This is possibly the easiest chicken I've ever made.****The dough on this loaf is impeccable and swoon-worthy, and I have seen my fair share of breads... that being said, it is time intensive and requires being made ahead EVEN MORE THAN IT MIGHT SEEM. The rolling is trickier because of how dense the dough is, the spreading was also time intensive, and the braiding is the kind of thing that you progressively get better at, speed wise. Factor in cooling time! More specifically: 1) The braiding is significantly easier when it's colder so while you shape the first loaf, keep the other half of the dough in the fridge. 2) On the first loaf (which is the one I brought because the second one was a little under-done due to said recipe taking longer than anticipated) I accidentally sprinkled a couple handfuls of pecans before I realized the chocolate should be spread first--and with good cause. The chocolate mixture is very thick and requires some effort to spread evenly, and pecans in the mix did not make that effort easier. Probably took twice as long! 3) The loaf-closing suggestion of water was not inspired. I would try with egg next time. Cold dough does not stick to itself very well. 3) The bake time was slightly understated and my oven runs hot. My guess is that the difference is using a metal vs. a glass loaf pan. 4) When I made the glaze I was already an hour late, I did not stop to fully allow the sugar crystals in the glaze to melt entirely so the glaze was a bit gritty in parts-- I actually liked this texture variation. It is worth noting that I followed instructions and have pretty extensive experience with sugar caramelizing, and still thought I might have done it wrong... I made the glaze after the loafs had been cooling because I had forgotten about it, and so if you pre-make the glaze and put it on the loaves hot (as suggested) there's a decent chance the loaf heat will prevent the crystalization-- if that is the case, it's kind of genius.*****The picture in the book is NOT representative of the way one is instructed to cut the leeks, so don't get confused. Also the walnuts are supposed to get mixed in the dressing, not sprinkled on top though that would make it more pretty. I really liked the combo of red and golden beets, but I am a neon-color kind of gal. also, beware leaky beets! They are to be roasted wrapped in foil but some juice escaped. I would probably put a baking sheet in the oven on the lower rack to catch drips next time. The dressing is excellent and I can attest that just plain beets dressed in it is excellent. I don't think the walnut oil added that much since there are also walnuts in it... probably OK to just use a neutral oil."}, {"userName": "Honorata", "userReviewDate": "Jan 11, 2016", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/42822244-honorata", "userReview": "I cook a lot, and this book is a perfect example of why I still buy cookbooks while everything is within googling range.

First of all, the book is gorgeous. From it's softly padded cover, to the color laden images inside. Images of rich, mysterious food and bright every day images of markets and life around Jerusalem. It's an incredible cookbook with a coffee table feel. You want to leave this book out to pick up and browse through. The book begins with an introduction about Jerusalem food and history. It's then divided into the following chapters: Vegetables, Beans & Grains, Soups, Stuffed, Meat, Fish, Savory Pastries, Sweets & Desserts, and Condiments. The combination of flavors are so exotic and intriguing, that I found many things I marked to try. Vegetables: Roasted Sweet potatoes & Fresh Figs, Baby Spinach Salad with Dates and Almonds, Mixed Bean Salad, Kohlrabi Salad (could have used this when my CSA gave me weeks worth of kohlrabi. Beans & Grains: Falafel (must try this version), Wheat berries and swiss chard with pomegranate molasses, barley risotto with marinated feta.Soups: Cannellini bean & lamb soup, Tomato & Sourdough Soup.Stuffed: Stuffed onions, stuffed eggplant with Lamb & Pine NutsMeat: Roasted chicken with clementines & Arak, Chicken with caramelized onion & cardamom rice, Turkey & Zucchini burgers with Green Onions & Cumin, Fish: Panfried Mackerel with Golden Beet & Orange Salsa.Savory Pastries: Red Pepper & Baked Egg GalettesSweets & Desserts: Sweet Filo Cigars, MutabbaqCondiments: Quick Pickled Lemons, Pickled Mixed Vegetables with CurrySometimes people are concerned about having to go out and buy a slew of exotic spices whenever you try to cook from a specific ethnic cookbook. I have a fairly extensive spice cabinet and have most of the spices on hand. Many of the recipes call for cinnamon, allspice, ground coriander - spices that if you cook frequently, you probably have them in your pantry. I plan on purchasing pomegranate molasses and za'atar to allow me to try even more of the recipes.

This book makes me want to cook. Why? Well that's obviously because the dishes are so amazingly delicious.I lived in Israel for some seven years during the 1990s and have never really come to terms with the fact that where I live now I can't easily get hold of burekas, or a plate of winter warming phool (fava beans), or a satisfying bowl of fresh hummus scooped up with a hunk of tasty challah. So I realised that I'd have to make it myself, and after seeing Ottolenghi's recent TV series in the UK on Mediterranean food I realised that this book might be a good place to start.So far I've made felafel, tehini sauce, harissa paste, tehini (halva) cookies, and a supremely satisfying pearl barley risotto with a caraway marinated feta topping. ALL of them have been delicious - even if I say so myself - with the possible exception of the cookies being too sweet for my taste (easily remedied next time!). The instructions are clear, the photography is stunningly colourful and beautiful, and the more in-depth explorative passages on the cultural histories or significances of various foods are both fascinating and really well written.

These are not all quick recipes. They do take time. This isn't truly a con, but a warning.Overall: Since I first heard about this cookbook and saw its cover, I wanted to add it to my collection. It hasn't made it to my collection yet, but I\u2019m very glad I got to play with it. The meals aren't easy by any means. But they also aren't hard \u2013 you don\u2019t need to be a seasoned chef to make them. Do expect to spend time with your meals though. This is not a 30 minute cookbook.
