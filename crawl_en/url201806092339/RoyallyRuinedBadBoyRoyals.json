Scarred, tattooed and heir to the Badd dynasty, this is one man who is seriously misunderstood. Darker and grittier than the first book but just as sexy, we\u2019re brought a story that answers some of the questions previously raised and keeps you on your toes with a couple of nice unexpected twists thrown in along the way as Costello and Scotch end up on the run together. And whilst there is a bit of a damsel-in-distress scenario going on, Scotch is no wallflower with it soon becoming evident that it\u2019s not just Costello doing the protecting here. \nI\u2019ll lie cold in the ground before I let anyone hurt you, Scotch.\u201d\nI\u2019m the first to admit that whilst I love me an anti-hero, I\u2019m a difficult woman to please when it comes to mafia families.

Yep, his book ended with me in tears, not that something terrible happened but the point being that Costello was just a normal guy deep down who wanted to be loved, respected, appreciated, and he found that HEA. He so deserved it! The last few sentences of this book are just pure (not sure what word to use?) but they just say it all, they are Costello all wrapped up into everything. he is just more than a tough guys, killer, mean and rough and tough ...he might be a scar -ed man ...but there is just so so much under his skin. (that is every one in this world, we are just more than what is there for you to see on the outside.) Just one favorite quote (Costello is speaking:) \"Regrets will leave you rotten inside, Believe Me.\" This beauty came out October 3rd, I just found Scotch (aka Heather) too be just perfect. Did she ever put back in her nose ring? curious??! Maverick Badd (the father of the Badd crew) at times I think he is misunderstood ...but others he is just a real jerk ...but I guess you kind of have to be that way to have to be the a head of a big family. I think there is more to the sister Lula (what is her real name ... you have Lulabelle & Francesca.) I think I spelled those right, but Lula has a bigger part in this book being that Costello and her have a huge-r part in his backstory. I wanna know more about Lula. She sounds like an interesting. I tend to love or enjoy the not so popular characters. I love Costello best of all the brothers ... I look forward to more from these characters!! Such a great read. Thank you, Nora!! Loved it.

I enjoyed this story, especially Costello and Scotch's chemistry and his bad boy broody persona. I honestly could not get enough!When waitress Scotch discovers her bestfriend is in danger at the hands of a well-known gang member, she does what any bestfriend would do - risk her own safety and life to protect her friend. But when this unknowingly puts a target on her back, Costello Badd, the oldest son in the Badd mafia family does the unexpected and protects her. But what happens when lines are crossed and real feelings develop?As soon as I started reading this novel I was intrigued by Costello and his broody ways. I wanted his story and to see the deep facets he was hiding. I enjoyed his chemistry with Scotch and loved that she brought him into the light and made him want to feel again.All in all this was fantastic! I would like to thank Netgalley and Montlake Romance for an advanced copy of this book for an honest review.

Completely addicting from the start, I rapidly left reality for the afternoon to joyfully lust over Costello. I loved the family dynamic of the Badd's. You never knew what to expect and the author did a fantastic job with the journey of Royally Ruined. This story was not the average HEA or family drama! Royally Ruined would require it's own category - packed with heat, passion, loss, love, lust, terror, heartbreak, friendship and many unknown's. I couldn't help, but swoon over Costello. Lovable, fierce, protective and the ultimate alpha male. Oh yeah, and HOT!!! He is perceived as one way and proves to be another. He did not disappoint me, that's for sure! He may be rough around the edges, but considering what he was born into - that makes him even more appealing and desirable. Scotch is one of those character's that you feel a gravitating pull to. She is likable and relatable. I couldn't help, but want the happily ever after for her. She is the definition of a best friend - loyal to a fault. These covers are to DIE for! I was sold with just the tattooed muscles, but even the font, coloring and overall appeal is alluring!I would recommend Royally Ruined to fellow readers. If you desire something different - go ahead and start on the first installment, Royally Bad. You can start Bad Boy Royals for free with Kindle Unlimited. *at time of posting* I would recommend this to others. I would like to add that you don't want to skip book one - definitely worth the read!

I can't even pick a favorite brother right now because these books just keep getting so freaking good.While reading this book I was definitely rooting for Costello and Scotch from the beginning.

Scotch gets screwed when she tries to help her best friend out of a life threatening situation. She ends up on the run with a man she barely knows who is the only person she trusts to protect her.

Costello is the dangerous older brother who is broody, moody , strong., and lethal. Costello is the oldest who had been taught from day one that he was the next in line for the \"throne\" so he made sure to learn all he needed to for his duties but when he was 19, some bad things happened to his sister which wasn\u2019t his fault. He was blamed anyway and that caused major discord in the family Scotch/ Heather was a waitress at the adult club that Costello's family owned and worked. She was only working there so she could keep her eyes on her BFF Gina who was being abused by a member of \"Deep Shots\" and when Scotch came to Gina\u2019s aid when she was getting hurt again, she ended up in a gun struggle and the gun went off. Scotch is now on the run to save her life and that is how Costello meets Scotch. He steps in to help and helps her escape. Before long, she is pretending to be his GF. These two have such awesome chemistry and their banter is flirty and witty with a lot of sexual tension between them. But at times, there is something sad about both characters for Costello thinks he's not worthy of having anything worthwhile, like a girlfriend or wife in his life-have anything good to happen to him and Scotch thinks she is going to end up dead by The Deep Shots so this time with Costello is her last hurrah out of life. Its so sad yet these two together burn up the pages. This book has everything that you could ever want in a steamy romance read- action, suspense, angst, betrayal and a love so hot it will burn you completely in the right way. The humor is so good , I was laughing my socks off but at the same time, it is hauntingly sad and I was crying for the main characters and the pain they were each going thru. This is one story you don\u2019t want to miss. I cannot wait for book 3 in this series.

Nora Flite did a magnificent job of writing Costello and Scotch\u2019s story as a complete standalone from Royally Bad, that even if I hadn\u2019t already read it I would\u2019ve have needed to. Everything I needed to know about them was included in this book and I had no need to stop and go back to the first book for any references in the story line for past events. I\u2019ve had that happen to many times to count, and I\u2019m so thankful I was able to enjoy this just as independently as I had with the first book.The darker tone to Costello\u2019s character gave such a different feel to the story. Having gotten to know him a bit in the previous book, he was a bit of a mystery to me. So quiet and closed off, I often wondered what his story was and I\u2019m so thankful that I got it. Poor guy has been groomed for so long to head the family when the time came that he never got to enjoy life luxuries like his siblings. He\u2019s always had the weight of the world on his shoulders, so to speak, or at least the weight of the underworld. Not only being true royalty, but mafia royalty in their area - there is just so much to deal with. His sense fo duty and loyalty go so deep with him and he\u2019s willing to do whatever is necessary and at all costs to ensure the safety of his family and those he cares for. It was incredibly admirable and was exactly why Scotch was so drawn to him. Scotch was like the opposite side of the same coin when it came to Costello. She too will do what it takes to protect those she cares for and has such a strong sense of duty; that ultimately puts her in danger. She\u2019s tough and sassy and knows what she wants - even when it comes to making a move on the elusive Costello.This was a wonderful follow up in this series and I can\u2019t wait to get from from this author and the Badd family characters."}, {"userName": "Just Let Me Read- Sammy", "userReviewDate": "Sep 24, 2017", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/25300422-just-let-me-read--sammy", "userReview": "Royally Ruined was a sexy, edgy, suspenseful story that I could not put down. Nora Flite is a master storyteller, one who blends action, angst, humor, and sizzling hot chemistry to create a story that is absolutely riveting. \"My world had become more solid. More real. I'd found a purpose in keeping her safe, and then she'd filled the hollow parts inside me with her perfect existence.\"I loved the first book in this series and was so excited to get Costello's story. The brooding, dangerous, oldest Badd brother was a mystery I wanted to uncover, and I completely fell in love with him in this book. He was a pillar of strength; protective and lethal. Scotch was his equal in every way, a fierce and kind-hearted warrior who was loyal and full of spunk. Their interactions from the very beginning were so engaging, and I enjoyed the way their relationship progressed. The author did such a great job with the build up between them, and when they came together physically, it was like an inferno of epic proportions. \"Costello was the black cloud, the lightening bolt. In the darkness he was a thousand mouths and a million hands and I wanted to feel every finger. Every kiss. I wanted all of him\".Flite has such a great talent for blending together different elements seamlessly, creating a great experience for the reader. There were moments in the story that had me laughing out loud, and moments where I was on the edge of my seat. Costello and Scotch's story was as emotional as it was hot, as family secrets came to light and relationships took a turning point. My heart broke for Costello and the burdens he carried, and I wanted so badly for him to find peace with Scotch. I was so happy to see Kain and Sammy again, along with the rest of the Badd bunch. The author wove an exciting storyline that I am sure will bring even more intrigue in the next book. I am looking forward to reading more from this fantastic series!"}, {"userName": "Tessa", "userReviewDate": "Sep 30, 2017", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/7071525-tessa", "userReview": "I received a copy of this book through NetGalley for my honest review.Okay, let's suspend belief that royalty has any reason to start a mafia. Also, let's get past the phrase Bad Boy because the book was better than that over-used phrase. Also, YEAH! Being a royal was part of this one's plot! This book, while it was a rollercoaster and adventure, had an undertone of sweet. Costello was dangerous but very protective. I did like him a lot, far more than I expected to after the first book. He's got a strong protective instinct and a strong sense of right and wrong, which I didn't expect. Scotch was interesting, though I didn't feel her as well as I did Costello. She also has a protective instinct, and doesn't take crap. However, I felt like sometimes, she would give into certain things for the sake of the plot. However, she was still fun, and her joys in life were rather simple. Those things came through the strongest.The plot itself was fun. There were some twists that were fun, though nothing too surprising. One was, though. The one twist made me grin. A lot. Most of it was them being on the run and getting to know each other. A lot of cutes happened that made me happy.

You get a glimpse of Costello in Royally Bad and he was quite the brooding mysterious bad boy. Costello is the oldest and the first born son and he had been taught since day one that he was the next in line for the \"throne\" and that he needed to learn everything he could. Well, some bad stuff went down when he was 19 and his sister Lula begged him to tell their father or go the police but that is NOT how Costello was raised, so he took the blame for Lula getting hurt which caused a major riff in the family. Scotch (Heather) was a waitress at the adult club that Costello's family owned and operated. She was only doing it to keep an eye on her BFF Gina. The \"Deep Shots\" were in the club for a meeting and one of them was roughing Gina up and Scotch came to her aid and she ended up in a pistol struggle and the gun went off. Now Scotch needs to run to save her own life and Costello steps in to help. And just like a volcano, these two erupt together...woot, woot! And Thorne, I hope he gets a book.

Then she is thrown into a horrible situation while trying to save Gina's life.Costello doesn't think, he just acts to protects Scotch and helps her escape.

Soon the lines become very blurred between pretend and reality, but with Costello thinking he's not worthy and Scotch thinking she's a dead woman walking, neither can see a future for themselves.Costello isn't the typical hero - he's brooding, bad, and not even his family likes him.

This was such a fantastic read. This story pulled me in from the first page and kept me enthralled until the end. Two characters on opposite sides, both wanting to stay to themselves but an unfortunate event leads to both being brought together, and attempting to fight their attraction to one another. When the story starts out Scotch, much to her dismay, comes up close and personal with Costello. Already perturbed by Costello when Scotch tries to tell him she has an uneasy feeling about her friend, Gina, with a guy in one of the rooms, Costello brushes it off. But when Scotch goes to check on Gina and finds her being squeezed to a shade of purple she takes matters into her own hands and fights with the guy. A gun goes off and several think Scotch shoots the guy but she didn't. Costello leaves the club with Scotch to attempt to hide her to save her life. A ruse follows that they both agree to, Scotch will pose as Costello's girlfriend. Somewhere along the way lines blur and they forget everything is for show. Figuring out who the other is...will it bring them closer or will it be the factor that divides them? Such a great book and I highly recommend it.

Scotch is a woman who works as a server at a club his family owns. She is also protective of the ones she loves.

Costello is hot! I was glued to my kindle with this! What is it about a scarred and handsome dominant male that really gets you! This man definitely makes you want to crack his armor and see what is beneath! Sometimes the hero was a bit too cold and the heroine was a bit annoying but other than that, it was great. I read the first book in this series and I liked this one but not as much as the first. I did really enjoy it though. I certainly recommend it and I can't wait for more!"}, {"userName": "Susanne Scott", "userReviewDate": "Sep 18, 2017", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/63353129-susanne-scott", "userReview": "I was lucky enough to get an ARC copy of this book.I have waited so long for this book as the sequel to Royally Bad and boy I was not disappointed! I was expecting a lot darker story line as the build up to the character of Costello was that he was a dark character, however Nora made him so human and totally lovable. I don't want to spoil the plot, but I really enjoyed the mysteries from Royally Bad being explained and the tie in of detective stapler. I really hope there will be more stories about the Badd family."}, {"userName": "Ofelia", "userReviewDate": "Jan 17, 2018", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/22607929-ofelia", "userReview": "I just love Costello. He may pretend to be this tough guy who doesn\u2019t give a shit about anything but he is such a softy on the inside and is more compassionate than any of his brothers. He may feel more and the insults that are always directed at him by his family might cut deeper then anything could ever do but he will always be a badass when it comes to protect those he loves. A must read!"}], "description": "Sinful passion and delicious danger await in the second installment of USA Today bestselling author Nora Flite\u2019s Bad Boy Royals series.\nScotch never runs from difficult situations.
