But I feel like I was given a fairly good sample of Bradberry's writing style and plot direction. Especially since that is the whole point of the sample - it's supposed to make you want to buy the book. If you have a kindle, save yourself some risk and check out the sample first. :)In short, this book is terrible if A) you like original, interesting characters B) you like plot plausibility. The protagonist is a stereotypical good looking guy with a perfect life until things go terribly wrong. The characterization of him doesn't develop much past that, and therefore it is really hard to care for him as a real person because really, he's just a cardboard cutout. As are most of the other characters. Also, as an international relations grad student, I find the whole concept, especially Bradberry's concept, of a Chinese invasion and occupation completely implausible, ridiculous and distracting. The way Bradberry explains the occupation made me laugh in a sad sort of way. There is just little grasp of military strategy, and a whole slew of base Chinese stereotypes that have been propagated by the worst Sino-alarmists. It's offensive to the sensibilities of anyone who knows anything about China. In short, people don't live or act the way Bradberry writes them.Of course, this is a zombie novel, and the handling of zombies should be able to save the day. Too bad there is nothing new here either. I'm being unduly harsh I'm sure, but I could barely get through the first 16 chapters and there is no way I would pay for this book. World War Z all the way."}, {"userName": "Alice", "userReviewDate": "Apr 24, 2014", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/22595720-alice", "userReview": "[his other cryogenic buddies get some brain degenerative virus, and become mindless zombies.

None. The main character killed zombie children and used their dead bodies to provide traction for his car to get out of mud. And showed no remorse, no emotion, just did it because I'm sure the author thought it would shock his readers. Well, it did shock me, and make me wish the main dude would get his brains eaten by the zombies.Perhaps it was just me, but the writing seemed forced and trite, the plot a bit to easy to guess, the zombies to easy to kill, the list goes on and on.I really wanted to like this book, I did not."}, {"userName": "Jenell Diegor", "userReviewDate": "Aug 05, 2013", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/21215193-jenell-diegor", "userReview": "Who doesn't love a good zombie novel? Travis Bradberry's Cryonic brings out the best elements on a story about the undead. In this particular tale, he explores the scientifically possible \"re-animation\" of people - when they are frozen when they die, and brought back to life after a period of time. Unfortunately for our protagonist, Royce Bruyere, the world he woke up to was not the same as the one he left. A different governing power is now in control, and regards him as a possession rather than a person. It was well-written, full of action and adventure, and not a dull moment whatsoever. I am seriously looking forward to the end of the novel, but those first 16 chapters were a genuine treat to read!"}, {"userName": "Dee", "userReviewDate": "Apr 02, 2014", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/23699961-dee", "userReview": "So..... I wanted to like this book. I really did. The first few chapters were great and had me hooked. Too bad that didn't last long!If I can make an honest assessment of this book, it would be this: It read like a comic book, I'm sure my little brother would have loved it. Stereotypical, strong, suave, arrogant protagonist. Inferior secondary characters who only served to highlight the superiority of the main \"he-man\". Gory zombie violence. I think the author dreamed up a story for himself where he could live out his masculine fantasies. The prose was lacking, vocabulary was simple, and the conversations were repetitive. Disappointing! Thanks to Goodreads First Reads for the free copy."}, {"userName": "Steven James", "userReviewDate": "Jul 11, 2013", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/19368122-steven-james", "userReview": "I thought the book was a fantastic read. I'm not sure why there is so much hate for the characters. I found them all pretty interesting. This book was a real page turner for me especially with the short chapters. I couldn't stop reading it. The scenes in the book described the zombies and action perfectly. I feel like this would make a good movie. Everything I read played out in my head like I was seeing it in person. Easy to follow and understand the situation that the protagonist was put in."}, {"userName": "Anari", "userReviewDate": "Aug 06, 2013", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/22592980-anari", "userReview": "This novel had me gripped from the word go. Cryonic is a brilliantly spun, futuristic tale which begins with the death and subsequent re-animation of Royce Bruyere by the means of cryogenics. When he is brought to life, several decades later, he arises to find that the world is not a friendly place. China is the ruling super power and half of the U.S. has been enslaved. The Chinese are experimenting with dead bodies, in the hopes to revive their dead soldiers and continue with their plan for world domination - but there is a flaw in their design. Those that are being brought back to life are contracting a virus with sinister implications. Travis Bradberry will appeal to lovers of the genres Sci-Fi and Horror, and he writes with a superbly realistic style. The characters are well defined and the plot writhes like a snake - plenty of twists and turns to get excited about. Loved it. 5 Stars all the way."}, {"userName": "Sammy Smith", "userReviewDate": "Aug 05, 2013", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/5903290-sammy-smith", "userReview": "Wit, sidekicks, adventure and a real hero feel that immerses the reader in the zombie world. Yup, this book has it all!There was a fantastic mix of fiction, science and politics that made this book not only appealing, but strangely plausible. There is a small clich\u00e9 of the main character waking up to the zombie filled world, but hey \u2013 that\u2019s my only gripe from an otherwise fantastic tale AND there\u2019s something special to Royce (MCs) and his \u2018waking up\u2019 (I won\u2019t post spoilers).I thought this ended too soon, and I wanted more.

Please, don't read this book.To qualify, I love zombie books, and sci fi. World War Z is one of my all time favourite books. But not all zombie books are good, and this one really isn't. Having read some other reviews I felt I should edit my own, I'm not sure who's reading this and seeing a good writing style - it reads like a children's book, very basic easy reading, little characterisation, no in depth descriptions. The main character starts out likeable and becomes a complete cliche.

Horrible HORRIBLE dialog, flat characters, a plot that could have been intriguing if the author had actually spent any time with it, and the most ridiculous ending ever.

I\u2019m not typically a fan Zombie books or movies, but when I do partake, I am always interested in how the storyteller creates the Zombie epidemic. In other words, Zombies don\u2019t just appear out of nowhere, what event caused human beings to turn into Zombies in the first place? This book offers a brilliant explanation and I thoroughly enjoyed it. It\u2019s not just another Zombie book, it\u2019s a futuristic adventure.

Technical grammar is nigh on perfect and the dialogue believable and fresh. I loved the character voices.

There\u2019s darkness, tension, excitement and, at times, a real visceral horror as the craziness explodes around the main character, Royce.If you enjoy fast paced story-telling, with style and class \u2013 go for it.

This book is what science fiction is all about. It combines real life science with something kind of far-fetched. The science includes a world- wide catastrophe that has geo-political ramifications.

When Royce Bruyere dies, he is cryogenically preserved per his last wishes. When he is revived, he finds the Chinese have invaded and brought their miracle medicines with them. Unfortunately, not everyone they bring out of cryonics fares as well as Royce. With bloodthirsty victims literally nipping at his feet, Royce races across America to save his country and his family. This is a fun zombie novel if you can get past the science and geology that is ignored by the author. People are running for their lives; zombies are on constant attack; the question, will the world succumb or will it prevail is always at the fore front of the reader\u2019s mind.

Aside from the fast-paced and action packed sequences in almost every page, the author's superb writing makes you feel like you are actually right in the middle of it all.The way it was presented was highly researched, especially on the subject of cryogenics and the aftermath of a possible natural disaster.

He wakes up to be surrounded by Chinese people and finds out that the United States was invaded by China. He is the first person to be successfully reanimated, but through Chinese greediness, the others that are reanimated after he was turn out to become zombies. Interesting, huh? Definitely. Unfortunately, I was disappointed in the book. I felt that the main character was a little unbelievable and completely unlikable. The dialogue seems forced. Perhaps I had higher expectations since it was written by an award-winning author who has sold more than a million copies of his books.
