I knew very little about how many internal fights there were in that time, but also about the Japan-Koreean war, about how many castles were raised and destroied, how complicated the etiquette was among the high class rulers ... how much art and love for the beauty ( cherry blossoms, the light of the moon, the plants in a garden, the poetry) intermingled with sheer cruelty, death for honor, and contol over other\u2019s lives, especially over women\u2019s lives. The most powerful men in Japan would have as many as 30 concubines, and emotionally it was not too easy for them with dealing with their rivals. Their becoming a concubine did not seem as much of a choice, neither were most marriages, arranged for security and political matters. All these create a very interesting society than the one we know, that is very well described in the book. The writing style is sketchy, with a rapid tempo and it manages to focus both on the historical events, as well as on the psycholgy of the characters. Dialogues are rare, and they are usually used during times of high psychological pressure. The most mundane reply, usually hides a very complicated internal process, that is a mixture of etiquette, strategy and self control. The human nature is the same - people are jealous, they love, they hate, they want glory, they seek power; but the japanese society regulates the manifestation of human nature in a very interesting manner, thus the external behaviours are not what we would expect or what we are used to, even compared with the same time frame in the western culture. Overall, a true piece of art and a worthy reading."}, {"userName": "Civisurbi", "userReviewDate": "Dec 17, 2015", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/14757880-civisurbi", "userReview": "\u041c\u0430\u0441\u0448\u0442\u0430\u0431\u043d\u043e\u0435 \u0445\u0443\u0434\u043e\u0436\u0435\u0441\u0442\u0432\u0435\u043d\u043d\u043e\u0435 \u043f\u0440\u043e\u0438\u0437\u0432\u0435\u0434\u0435\u043d\u0438\u0435 \u0441 \u0438\u0441\u0442\u043e\u0440\u0438\u0447\u0435\u0441\u043a\u043e\u0435 \u043f\u043e\u0434\u043e\u0441\u043d\u043e\u0432\u043e\u0439. \u0427\u0438\u0442\u0430\u0442\u044c \u0432\u0434\u0443\u043c\u0447\u0438\u0432\u043e."}, {"userName": "Laurence", "userReviewDate": "Sep 10, 2007", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/335730-laurence", "userReview": "Interesting epic saga of a Japanese woman in the Medieval unifying Japan."}], "description": "Publicat \u00een 1955 \u00een foileton \u00eentr-un supliment al prestigioasei reviste Bungeishunj\u016b, romanul Nobila doamn\u0103 din Yodo (Yodo-dono nikki) este o capodoper\u0103 care, \u00eembin\u00e2nd realismul sever cu lirismul dramatic, surprinde cu acuitate psihologic\u0103 parcursul spectaculos \u0219i totodat\u0103 tragic al concubinei seniorului Hideyoshi, personaj real, intrat \u00een legend\u0103.Chacha, eroina din Castelul Yodo, a ajuns, din victim\u0103 aruncat\u0103 \u00eentr-o mizerie lucie, a doua so\u021bie a comandantului Hideyoshi, unul dintre cei mai curajo\u0219i seniori din Japonia. \u00cen ambele ipostaze, ea \u0219i-a r\u0103mas \u00eentotdeauna fidel\u0103 sie\u0219i, respect\u00e2nd parc\u0103 un cod personal al samurailor.
