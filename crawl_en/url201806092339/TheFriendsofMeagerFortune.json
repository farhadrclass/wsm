He impressed me immediately as what I think of as a great storyteller. His novels are the kind you want to curl up in front of a fire with and read for hours at a time.\u201cThe Friends of Meager Fortune\u201d elevated my respect for him to another level. It is arguably an epic work. He vividly and thoughtfully chronicles the harsh world of the New Brunswick lumber trade in the days when men were men and danger was the price of earning a living. It\u2019s worth reading on that basis alone.But it also offers deep and probing character studies and a sharp-edged look at how society arbitrarily draws and redraws it lines of right and wrong. The title itself reverberates on many levels but I won\u2019t give those away.Leave yourself plenty of time to enjoy this classic. It\u2019s worth savoring."}, {"userName": "kp", "userReviewDate": "Jan 14, 2012", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/5297582-kp", "userReview": "There are many things I find hard to express, and one of them is the effect that any novel by David Adams Richards is likely to have on me. He combines an Elizabethan sense of tragedy with a compassionate yet clear-sighted regard for the human soul. He captures all I know to be true of human beings: their self-deluded solipsism, their fierce love, their capacity for awe and spite and terror and regret and adoration and deceit and suffering and pride and beauty.This novel focuses on a lumber family before and after the second world war and the New Brunswick community in which it rises and falls. Adams Richards knows that epic plots that play out in the small corners of the world as well as on the great stages of public history. He limns small-town life, narrow-mindedness, simple generosity and family bonds with deep wisdom and recreates the lives of the foresters, still working the woods in these days with horses and axes, with a rough and brooding tenderness. The scenes set on Good Friday Mountain, where a group of men struggle through weeks of ice, snow, danger, and treachery to bring down a chunk of forest, are breathtaking, but what really gripped me in this novel was feeling the winch tightening as the full force of a community's spite and sorrow bears down on the innocents in its midst. The novel is about what one character calls \"a famine in the soul,\" but that famine can never quite devour the possibility for goodness inherent in human beings, and Adams Richards gives us a tribute to and an elegy for the love that sometimes saves us and for a way of life that has disappeared."}, {"userName": "Stephen", "userReviewDate": "Jul 14, 2010", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/1711167-stephen", "userReview": "Epic tree-cutting.

This book is set in the lumber camps of the Miramichi in New Brunswick, and the hard and dangerous lives of the men who work there. The time is just before and after WW2, when the work is done with saws, axes, horses and sledges and reads like a Greek tragedy.This way of life will quickly become obsolete with the mechanization of the lumber industry. I won't go into the summary of the book as this has been well done already. I will comment on the book's clever title. I thought meager fortune referred to the poverty in which many of the people in his books live, or that meager fortune indicated the misfortune/bad luck which is the fate of many of his characters. Part way through the book we learn that Meager Fortune is actually the name of a physically small man doing odd jobs in the camp. Early on the lumberjacks consider him simple minded, but he shows himself later to be heroic and kind in a place of great danger where there is little compassion for other workers.4.5 stars"}, {"userName": "Bobbi", "userReviewDate": "Feb 03, 2010", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/3149193-bobbi", "userReview": "I discovered this book and author when I was in New Brunswick a year or so ago. He's won numerous book awards, so I bought this one and loved it. Here is the description of the novel from Amazon. \"Mary Jameson, the widow of a lumber magnate, hopes to stymie the prophecy she receives from a fortune-teller\u2014that her oldest son will be powerful and her younger son will bring glory upon the family, but they will be the end of the family. When Will Jameson, the brash older brother, suffers a fatal logging accident, and Owen, the intellectual younger son, returns a wounded hero from WWII, it seems the prophecy may come true. Owen assumes leadership of the family business, but faced with stiff competition, he sends men to fell timber deep in hazardous terrain. Logging troubles, combined with Owen's military service with Reggie Glidden, Will's best friend, and a romantic entanglement with Reggie's wife, touches off a devastating sequence of events. The book's most resonant moments spring from Richards's account of Jameson's loggers. Though undercut in places by a thick colloquialism, Richards's work at its best approaches the poetic nuances of Greek tragedy.\""}, {"userName": "Stephen Hayes", "userReviewDate": "Nov 27, 2009", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/1847296-stephen-hayes", "userReview": "I haven't finished this book, and I doubt that I will. My wife picked it up cheap in a book shop that sells remainders, and read it. She said that she found the style difficult, and that she had to read each sentence twice. It's about a logging family in eastern Canada before and after the Second World War, and small town gossip and rumours. I picked it up for bedtime reading when I was too tired to read anything more demanding and found it too demanding. I too found I was having to read every sentence twice, though I'm not sure why. The sentences are not over long, nor are they complicated in structure. But on first reading, the meaning doesn't seem to get through, and one has to read it again to see how it connects with what went before.

But the writing is over-dramatic and repetitive, and the characters are familiar stereotypes (the intellectual male misfit in a manly family; the woman so innocent she doesn't realize that her words and actions are being interpreted by the town as immodest; the saintly, picked-on character who never turns on those who persecute him, etc.). Having said that, I will also say that Richards shows some skill at illuminating the motives of the loggers and townspeople who end up behaving badly; perhaps there's some take-away there for all of us."}, {"userName": "BookDigger", "userReviewDate": "May 12, 2008", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/859309-bookdigger", "userReview": "So far, definitely an interesting novel. I like it at this point and am hooked to see the rest unfold. In the first 22 pages, three deaths occurred, definitely leaving me astounded and curious. Owen is a character I find compelling and realistic, as I did Will Jameson. There seems to be a mystery behind Mary to me that I have yet to unfold. What is to happen is quite another mystery to me as well. Great start considering so many books are predictable these days. (more to add once I've read more)The plot line was interesting to me, but the actual writing just didn't, satisfy me I guess. It seemed dry and almost bland.

The two brothers, Will and Owen, have grown up in a lumber family in New Brunswick and although very different, carry on the family business.
