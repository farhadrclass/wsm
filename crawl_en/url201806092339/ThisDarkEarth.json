No, I haven't read it, but I will now.This Dark Earth takes us from the beginning of the zombie apocalypse through the early development of a new civilization. Not treading a whole lot of new ground here are we?And I think that's what's blowing me a way with this book is that it's nothing new, but at the same time it felt fresh and vibrant and I COULD NOT put it down. I guess that shows what kind of writing chops this author has.We start out following Doc Lucy Ingersol's point of view as the first of the outbreak begins to show up in the hospital in which she works. The waiting room breaks out in what I can only compare to Draculas. All hell breaks loose. She gets away, barely, and luckily gets picked up by a trucker who goes by the name of Knock Out...just as the world is being blown to smithereens, or just well-placed nukes in every major city. While this isn't a whole lot different from the normal zombie fair, I can say he does a few things differently, at least in my limited experience. The first, is the entire set up of the novel. It's only made up of 7 chapters, each, for the most part, is a different character and in first person. They're all interconnected somehow and thus, you're able to get really close to each of the main characters.The second thing is that you can't trust what will happen with these characters. Obviously, this is a zombie novel and of course no one's really safe...but then, The Walking Dead still has most of the main characters, even Carl...wait...where's Carl!?!?!Speaking of The Walking Dead, if you're a fan of the show, I think you'll really connect with this book. Some of the same themes show up here, such as the need to avoid cities with their huge populations.The back cover of the book has a quote from S.G. Browne that says this book is The Road meets World War Z. While I haven't read WWZ, I have read The Road and I can kind of see where he's coming from. The people who have survived at 3 years out are some of the nastiest around. There are good people granted, but where would the fun be if only those existed. While this book is much more on the pulp end of things, I can definitely see that this comparison makes sense. There are some truly poignant events that occur that had my emotions running high. I can also say that I don't think I've read anything more brutal than what happens to one of the characters and the whole time it felt like I was going through it.On that note, this book definitely isn't for the faint of heart. Lots of blood and guts fill the pages, not to mention some other uncomely acts. All in all, if you're going to read a zombie book, I'd recommend you read This Dark Earth. Once you start, you won't be able to put it down anyway, so start now.4 out of 5 Stars (Highly Recommended)"}, {"userName": "Carol.

Seven interconnected stories follow a doctor, her son and a trucker as the zombie apocalypse goes down. The son is a cold-blooded Messiah figure while the trucker provides him with emotional guidance. Humanity remains largely cruel and selfish, although some people will martyr themselves for the good of the herd. Let the rebuilding commence!*******************************************************The first section starts off very well, leaving me deeply engrossed in the story. Near ground zero, a pathologist, Lucy, discovers that there's something odd about the people overflowing the waiting room. They seem to be seizing, febrile, violent, or gnawing at their own fingers and lips. Uncomfortable with the drama, Lucy and a pediatrician friend concentrate on a woman with a sick baby. Lucy starts problem-solving the illness until her pediatrician friend pulls her away from her myopic focus on pathophysiology, and raises the larger issue of their safety. They escape with the woman and her baby as heavily armored officers storm the E.R. Shortly after, Lucy hitches a ride with Knock-Out, a trucker, as she attempts to avoid the containment zone. Surviving the nuclear fallout and finding Lucy's son Gus quickly becomes their focus.By giving the reader a close-up of the drama unfolding at the hospital, we get a feel for the human tension of early disaster and the obligations of a healer. One of the interesting components of zombie stories is the reaction at the outbreak. What will happen? Will it be recognized? Ultimately, it all depends on how fast the disease travels and the incubation period, and so far no one has done it better than World War Z: An Oral History of the Zombie War. (Well, Brooks and the people writing the reports on bird flu). Jacobs gives us an inside perspective with a doctor and a possible initial official response, and it's the kind of insight that can really lend an interesting twist to a traditional zombie survivalist story. Jacobs writes well, with non-stop action and skilled structure and imagery. One of the initial views of the zombies:\"Again, milky eyes glared at her. Lucy couldn't pin it down exactly, but there didn't seem to be any awareness in those eyes. It was as if some deep-sea creature felt eddies and currents spun off a passing fish and moved to attack, working on pure instinct.\"Meeting Knock-Out, the trucker: \"The trucker who picked her up was a brawny, thick man, bristly and unkempt. The cab smelled of cigarettes, energy drink, and corn chips. But the fecund normalcy of the man almost made Lucy want to cry.\"Unfortunately, the book fails to shine for two significant reasons and one small one. The first is the structure of the collection itself. Sections centered on seven different characters are all too loosely connected to result in a satisfying story gestalt. As bit character pieces, they range from decent to outstanding, but as a plot, its an unsatisfying way to build tension and consistency.The second major reason the book falls apart is the point-of-view switching. If the plot isn't enough to pull it together, characterization can't save it either, especially when Tessa only gives us a minor, outsider version of the trio of Lucy, Knock-Out and Gus, and the engineer Broadsword isn't involved with them at all. We barely get to know either of them besides the immediate context of the apocalypse and their relationship to the main characters, so it doesn't carry the emotional weight it could have. The sections vary considerably in length, but are shorter toward the end of the book: Lucy's is 48, Knock-Outs 73, Tessa's 47, Gus 79, Barbara 24, the engineer 35, and the final section 22. It destroys the pacing to be dropped into another person's head so irregularly. Making it more challenging is the 'minutes' entry style of Barbara's section, incongruous with the rest of the narratives.The final, ironic quibble: when you write well, the expectations are higher and missteps more obvious. Rhiannon Frater's The First Days is somewhat similar to the section on Lucy's experience-- intricate detail in recognizing and surviving the beginning of an epidemic. However, Frater's writing is written at a simpler level, so the enjoyment comes out of the fast-moving plot and willingness ignore language problems. Jacob, on the other hand, is clearly a talented writer, so oddities are stick out more. The pediatrician's initial \"Why are we here? In this town\" line smacked of entry-level writer's introduction. Then there are the patients in the waiting room--for the life of me, I can't figure out how someone can \"swallow her own lips.\" As a medical person, I've heard of swallowing a tongue, but as Jacobs clearly loved the lip imagery, it remained distracting. I won't bore you with the rest of the 'hmm' moments, but they were there.Finally, I get it. It's the apocalypse. A story doesn't need to have rape in order for us to understand inhumanity. Authors: as tempting as the cliche is, try to reach a little higher.Good writing, standard zombie survival story, messy narrative. Recommended for readers who want to cover the genre, or are able to treat it as short stories in a connected setting.One star and another star and one other star and a little bit extra of a star equals three and a quarter stars.Cross posted at http://clsiewert.wordpress.com/2013/0..."}, {"userName": "Trudi", "userReviewDate": "May 03, 2012", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/1416912-trudi", "userReview": "Liked it overall, but I did have my problems with it. The Good: 1. The zombies (aka zeds, shamblers, revs (short for revenants)) -- there is nothing unique about Jacobs' zombies: they are slow, and gooshy, and stink. They are dangerous in hordes and are attracted to sound. All this we've seen before; nevertheless, the descriptions are remarkably vivid -- skulls shattering, teeth splintering, intestines bursting, and always the terrible, gag-inducing smell of rot.2. The first 121 pages are a complete adrenaline rush. Action begins on page 1 and does not relent for a moment. We meet Dr. Lucy Ingersoll on the afternoon her hospital succumbs to chaos. An inexplicable virus is causing people to seizure, auto-cannibalize, attack, die and re-animate. Lucy is our entry point into the start of the end of the world. She assesses her situation and realizes she must abandon the hospital if she is to rescue her son, Gus, at home with his father. In her attempt to get to her family, Lucy crosses paths with Knock-Out, a giant of a man with a gentle and kind way about him. These 121 pages are strong enough to stand on their own as a rip-roaring novella of zombie insanity, replete with nuclear detonations.The Bad:The shifting character POV did not work for me. The first 121 pages grabbed me by my short hairs. I loved the brutal immediacy of the story. Everything feels so *urgent* and *perilous*. I loved Lucy and Knock-Out. Then the book shifts gears and we are getting Tessa's story. Okay, I'll keep following you. Tessa's story is sad and icky. But intense. I found her very sympathetic. Just as I was getting emotionally invested, the story shifts again. Now it's three years later and Lucy's 14-year-old son Gus takes over narrating. Then the POV shifts *again* and we have some chick Barbara sharing the minutes from the various committee meetings of the Bridge City survivors enclave. And there will be one more POV change before the novel concludes. So many shifts in narration, from first to third person, lost me by the end of the book. It was hard to sustain emotional involvement with any of the major characters. The book ends up reading like a collection of interconnected short stories, and on their own, each of the chapters are actually quite strong. It's when you force them to act as a novel where things fall apart. That's when huge problems with pacing and characterization appear, along with a natural momentum towards a meaningful and satisfactory climax (of which there isn't one). Despite these issues, there's something about this book that recommends itself. It's got that gritty, western kind of vibe going, a little Mad Max, a little The Road and of course Kirkman's The Walking Dead (it's just not possible to read about the slavers and Captain Konstantin and not be reminded of the Governor). If you're craving zombies, and a bleak and desperate post-apocalyptic landscape, you could do a lot worse than This Dark Earth."}, {"userName": "Lou", "userReviewDate": "May 29, 2012", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/3699303-lou", "userReview": "Let me lay all the cards on the table and let me tell it to you in a straight and simple way of what we have here before us.In this story John Hornor Jacobs has put before us a case ofthe good, the bad and the ugly!The Good = a mum, son and a father = courageous, survivors and fighters.The Bad = the Slavers = enslave women and men, selfish and want to control the living.The Ugly = the Shamblers = the undead, cannibals and ugly.The scene is set the desolate earth the dark earth of ruin and destruction.

It's weird and twisted, I know. When I think about the horror movies that have left me most terrified and the only ones that really come to mind are zombie related: 28 days later, 28 weeks later, Dawn of the Dead, even the sketch comedy / horror versions like Zombieland and Shaun of the Dead leave me with vivid nightmares. I think it has something to do with the fact that everyone you know and love becomes a monster. Oh, and the fact that there is a possibility that there could be a six billion monster mob chasing after you. If you survive that is. Despite how terrified I am, I keep gravitating towards everything zombie related, including novels. Honestly, it wasn\u2019t until my newest (and probably most powerful) obsession with The Walking Dead (the television series and the graphic novels) that I really understood what it was I loved about zombies; obviously I don\u2019t love the zombies themselves (rational considering they are flesh eating monsters who used to be our friends and family) but I love the dark stories of how the survivors figure out how to survive when society as we know it is in shambles. This is exactly why I loved This Dark Earth. Oh, and the fact that is has probably one of the most bad ass covers to date\u2026The Deal:The novel starts off in a hospital and the initial outbreak is narrated by an oncologist, Lucy. As the virus spreads, the world crumbles and the few uninfected struggle to survive (typical recipe for a zombie novel). The novel is broken down into seven chapters, each chapter written in first person narrative from the point of view of a different character. As the novel progresses we hear from Lucy, the doctor, a kind hearted trucker name Knock-Out, a middle aged woman, Tessa, who is determined to survive no matter what the cost, and Lucy's freakishly smart son, Gus, among others. Through the various narratives we learn how they were surviving when nearly no one else is. My Take:This Dark Earth by John Honour Jacobs was exactly what I want when I pick up a zombie novel. It was a dark and terrifying tale (I could not read this one before I went to bed) with strong characters struggling to survive in a society that has gone to shit. And it just happened to include flesh eating \"shamblers\". The novel was broken down into seven chapters and each chapter was narrated by a different character in first person. Each character has such a different narrative voice and because of this, the novel actually almost reads like a collection of different short stories on the same topic rather than a novel. Typically, I am not a huge fan of this style of writing but in This Dark Earth it works. While I didn\u2019t love every character's voices or stories ( ex/ Tessa or the Engineers) I do believe each chapter was an important contributor to the text as a whole. Plus, the characters that I had become more attached to (Gus, Lucy, Wallis, Knock-Out) were, for the most part, still in the thick of things. In my opinion, the multiple narrative voices also add to the credibility of the novel. Personally, there is nothing I hate more than an unbelievable story where the same ordinary guy survives impossible situation after impossible situation. It is simply annoying. Thankfully, Jacobs didn\u2019t fall victim to this because the narrator changing from chapter to chapter solves this problem \u2013 it is now possible for the person in that specific situation to die without ending the story. Clearly this adds to the suspense.Personally, I couldn't put this book down. I found it to be a refreshing take on the genre. Yes, there was a lot of the typical stuff you see in a zombie novel (ex/ a mysterious and unexplainable virus, the aid of the armed forces, the innocent child who becomes jaded) but in my opinion the brilliant survival ideas and the incredible characters make up for it.For me, the highlight of This Dark Earth was the characters; specifically Lucy, Gus and the gentle Knock-out. Yes, there were zombies. Yes, there was violence. Yes, there was suspense. But most importantly, there were fabulous characters who you will fall in love with, who you want to survive, who you truly believe deserve to survive.

A few novels play with these tropes, turning them on their heads, making them something new, creating stories with heft or humor or gravitas. S.G. Browne's BREATHERS comes to mind as does WORLD WAR Z, and now so should THIS DARK EARTH. Gripping and intelligent, the cover declares it a zombie novel, but you'll find it to be so much more."}, {"userName": "Nickolas", "userReviewDate": "Feb 22, 2013", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/6459136-nickolas", "userReview": "If there is one thing you Elitist Book followers are aware of about me it has got to be the number of things I don't like in fiction - and how good authors can subvert these preferences and make me eat crow. So in another installment of \"Things Nick Hates\" I present you (drumroll please) zombies. I'm sorry, but they bore me. I used to like them and I still hold onto the belief that THE ZOMBIE SURVIVAL GUIDE and WORLD WAR Z are some of my favorite books of all time. Still, there is a saturation of zombies (sort of like the over abundance of vampires a couple years ago) and I find it tiring. There are only so many things you can do with zombies and it would take something different to interest me in another piece of undead fiction. THIS DARK EARTH by John Hornor Jacobs is that \"something different\" and it served to remind me how much I used to love the sub-genre. The apocalypse has come and gone, ushered in by a zombie outbreak and attempted nuclear containment. The remnants of humanity live in a pre-industrial society, hunkered down in the ad-hoc fortress of Bridge City. The city is near impervious to the zeds, a marvel of ingenuity and medieval siege mastery. Humans though, have a capacity for evil that far exceeds the mindless, flesh eating, undead. An army of slavers has Bridge City in its sights and the survival of civilization falls to Gus, the young man that designed the very fortifications that have kept the wild at bay for so long. Do you know how THIS DARK EARTH manages to be both a zombie novel and a book that I love? It's a zombie novel but it's not about zombies. Don't get me wrong, there are loads of zombies within the pages. Tens of thousands of zombies. There's plenty of bludgeoning and brain-destroying, with buckets of putrid gore and viscera. But that's not the focus of the novel. THIS DARK EARTH goes to show that even in the wake of global catastrophe, even with the cannibal dead roaming the earth, the living can still manage to take the whole evil cake. THIS DARK EARTH is a story of family, community, and survival. The three main characters are Lucy, her son Gus, and Jim (aka Knock-Out). Lucy is cold and clinical. She is a brilliant doctor, with a highly analytical mind that leaves her detached from humanity. She is not delicate in the least. Lucy is almost robotic, but that's not to say she is stiff or thin as a character. When she exhibits a rare moment of tenderness it is touching. Knock-Out is a gentle giant, he was a trucker before the end of the world and becomes a loyal companion after. He is a genuinely kindhearted man that serves as the adhesive for the others. He's the sidekick to Lucy's superhero. And then we have Gus, the brilliant child that designed Bridge City who grows into the hardened man that must lead the free and the living. Gus shares much in common with his mother, his intense personality is only compounded by the trials of growing up in this post-apocalyptic world. He is a strange young man, extremely intellectual and still inexperienced in many ways. He has a lot to learn before he can become humanity's savior. There are other characters, three of the chapters are told from their perspectives, but they serve primarily to forward the story of Lucy, Gus, and Knock-Out. In this way THIS DARK EARTH felt like a collection of short stories based around a central thread. It's not, but the shifting narrative (between first person, third person, and one chapter told in journal format) gives an interesting, multi-faceted view of proceedings. The first half of the novel is a somewhat standard post-apocalyptic/zombie affair. One of the blurbs on the back of the book likens THIS DARK EARTH to Cormac McCarthy's THE ROAD and WORLD WAR Z by Max Brooks. The first part of the book definitely relates to THE ROAD, as Lucy and Knock-Out scramble to survive in a world only recently turned upside down. It's at the halfway mark that I became fully absorbed in the read. It is here that we are introduced to Bridge City and the looming threat of the slaver army. From here Gus and the city council race to find a way to stop the army's progress and defend all that they have built. This is where the novel takes on a bit of the atmosphere of WORLD WAR Z, but really I couldn't help but think of the CBS action/drama Jericho. I loved the creation of Bridge City and the society that the survivors had established in the aftermath of the outbreak and nuclear fallout. THIS DARK EARTH is a dark book (go figure). It displays the worst that mankind has to offer, from rape to slavery and greed. There is heavy violence (mainly zombie slaying but some living on living action too) as well as a grisly torture. Despite all this there is also a silver lining of hope. Despite all the death and despair it shows that we can survive and adapt as a species - we can look out for our own.

Second, while the book contains plenty of the standard zombie cliches I expected, it does still manage to throw in a couple of unique twists and turns, just enough to keep me reading to see what happenes next. Third, while having each chapter be told from the POV of different characters is not unique (rare in published works but not unheard of), I did find it disconcerting to have the narrative POV change from third person to first person depending on the character in question. To me that seems more of an amateur's mistake, something a professional editor would catch and correct; IMO you should pick with one mode and stick with it. Finally, I found the ending a bit abrupt and not particularly satisfying. Unless this is just the first in a coming series (God knows it's trendy right now to produce everything in trilogies), it definitely left a lot of questions unanswered. But maybe that's the point of zombie apocalypse fiction...?My verdict? It's still worth reading, particularly if you do NOT want yet another YA knock-off. The author is not afraid to kill off main characters, or even narrative ones, which does add a sense of urgency to what is supposed to be urgent storytelling!

Some parts I really enjoyed, others...not so much. To call the beginning over-the-top is likening a nuclear explosion to a \"sizable bang\". I thought it was far-fetched. Like Sandra Bullock jumping a gap in a bridge with a metro bus far-fetched. I also thought the medical jargon was unnecessary was well, other than to show that, yes, Dr. Ingersol really *was* a doctor. But if you like frenetic action in the opening sequence of your books, this one definitely delivers. Another issue I have is with John Connor...ahem, Gus Ingersol. For a 10 year old kid to have that kind of, I don't know, gravitas, was a more than a little far-fetched for me. To be honest, if I ever met a kid like Gus, I'd be more than a little worried he'd grow up to be a serial killer. Not to mention the 14 year old version doing what he did - it was too much. I realize that fictional stories demand suspension of disbelief but there's suspending it and then there's shooting it into a black hole. This Dark Earth demanded that I do that.But it wasn't a bad book overall. Sure the characters could have used more development and weren't all that empathetic (Knock-Out being an exception).

Lucy started the book with tons of character and appeal but then takes a backseat to Gus who is not only difficult to identify with, being a prodigy and all, but doesn't seem to have any emotions. No one stands a foil to Gus so it's hard to fall into the book like it was earlier on with Lucy and Knock-out. One of the better zombie books out there but not as good a book, in general, as it started out."}, {"userName": "Christine", "userReviewDate": "Oct 03, 2012", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/9682631-christine", "userReview": "Absolutely the best horror, zombie,end of the world, apocalyptic book I have read. This dark earth by John Hornor Jacobs hits the ground running from page one to the last page and leaves you begging for more. The main characters are Lucy, a self-reliant hard working doctor who is better with the microscope than dealing with patients, her son Gus a 10 year old who's world has turned into a living nightmare and Knock-Out, a trucker who comes into their lives at the right or wrong time, you decide. Not everyone likes this type of story line but those who do, will avidly devour (no pun intended) this book. The last chapter will have you gasping and praying that there is more. Gus and Lucy's story is not finished."}, {"userName": "Cameron", "userReviewDate": "Jul 03, 2012", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/1593477-cameron", "userReview": "Standard zombie-apocalypse fare. Not too badly written, but the point of view changes from character to character, and you only have one first-person pov at a time. It's a unique way to tell a story, but I don't see how it made the story better. I subtracted a few stars for inaccurate use of medical terminology, the use of graphic rape scenes to villify his villain, and a transparent use of the novel to air the author's idea that an interstate overpass is a good locale for a survivor settlement (which he then failed to support). That being said, it still had an effective story arc, believable characters, and a fine pace. It was a great break from several weeks of work-related studying.Finally got around to reading it - thank you Lakeshia!!!"}, {"userName": "Delia", "userReviewDate": "Sep 04, 2013", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/23678184-delia", "userReview": "Mediocre characters, weak story, offensive and unnecessary imagery. Everything was fine and I was enjoying the book until Tessa's story... that left turn took the book into no-man's land in a bad way. I stuck it out to the end because it is a page turner... However, the climax is nothing more than a dud. Too much time lapses and you're never quite sure where the Hell you are or who the heck you are, or even what the heck you're reading about. While the point of view changes were clever, they left me wishing we'd go back to the core characters, which never happens. The reduction of star rating is for confusing text, obscene content, lack of resolve, and too many similarities to The Walking Dead Graphic Novels (which I did not detail in my review for sake of Spoilers)."}, {"userName": "Benoit Leli\u00e8vre", "userReviewDate": "Oct 07, 2012", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/3634428-benoit-leli-vre", "userReview": "This is the zombie novel to end all the zombie novels.

There are many narrators for the different turning points of the story, giving it a fresh outlook every time. It's a fascinating, exhilarating and sometimes stomach-turning read that will keep your innards tied into a knot. Jacobs is one of the best new talents out there.

Set in Arkansas and told from the perspective of several different characters, this apocalyptic story explores human behavior and needs--the good and the bad--when left without rules and authority. We see people rise to an occasion for leadership and others sink to abysmal levels becoming the worst kind of dictators.

A friend gave the kindle version of this book and I read it with some reservations. My reservations were unfounded. Instead of the standard tropes of the genre, the author presents a plausible world with well developed characters. Instead of people making stupid decisions, his characters take acts that are both believable and intriguing. It has the grittiness you come to expect from zombie novels and such without letting it overwhelm the human aspect. I highly recommend picking up this book, an excellent read."}, {"userName": "Jessica Hare", "userReviewDate": "Dec 08, 2012", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/7051764-jessica-hare", "userReview": "I'm happy I read this book. It helped me realize how important it is to create a good time frame in a book. It was all over the place and I had no idea of the flow of the book at all. Typically, it is hard to write from so many different character's perspectives. However, it can be done right and beautifully. Unfortunately, this book fell short in character development. There are some really good and gruesome Zombie killing parts.

Each chapter is narrated by a different character in the first person until the last, which takes a third person PoV (but follows the narrator of the fourth and best chapter). The structural risk pays off for the most part, but ends up stranding two of the seven chapters largely in pointlessness.
