'Frank, my life, I've ruined it.'Jerry Lee and Frank are as close as two brothers can be. They've been through thick and thin . . . mostly thin, and now they're on the lam because of a hit-and-run accident. 'All right, Frank, it's story time.' says Jerry Lee, and Frank obliges, telling his wild imaginings about the brothers being ranch owners, or World War II fighter pilots - anything but what they are - two fugitives with a cloud of doom hanging over their heads. Vlautin wrote one of my favorite stories from The Highway Kind, a book I read earlier in the year. I wasn't disappointed in this, one of his first longer efforts, and I plan to read more of his titles soon.Bad luck, it falls on people every day. It's one of the certain truths. It's always on deck, it's always just waiting. The worst thing, the thing that scares me the most is that you never know who or when it's going to hit. But I knew then, that morning, when I saw the kid's frozen arms in the back of the car that bad luck had found my brother and me.

I easily lost myself in this story which on its surface appears to be about two brothers on the run and down on their luck. On a deeper level, it is not so simplistic. Vlautin writes about his characters\u2019 struggles with keen observations on familial bonds, compassion for those suffering, and resilience to physical and emotional struggles. As their situation becomes more grim, do they dare to hope for a change in circumstance? For redemption? \u201cWe\u2019re fuck ups, Frank, so we\u2019re gonna be with people that are fuck ups. And to me, to me, that makes sense. But that doesn\u2019t make them bad people, does it? If you\u2019ve had bad luck, it doesn\u2019t mean you\u2019ll always have bad luck, does it? Some people that are unlucky, they can get lucky. Not everyone\u2019s cursed, I don\u2019t think.\u201dFrank and Jerry Lee are brothers with a strong bond, and you get the feeling that it couldn\u2019t ever have been any other way. It\u2019s exactly the kind of thing that always wins me over when it\u2019s done right. The wildly imaginative stories that Frank tells Jerry Lee, the pictures that Jerry Lee draws (featured in the beginning of each chapter), and the dog that Frank rescues along way, all these things add color and vibrancy to what could otherwise be a tale of sadness and gloom. The ray of light in their darkness is hope. \"I hoped.

In fact, I'd like to corner Vlautin at the horse tracks, ply him with a beer, and let him tell me who he wrote this book for; I have a feeling he would tell me he wrote it for himself. This novel is a perfect example of the reader-attitudes I try to deconstruct in a university library, and Vlautin does it naturally, and intentionally, in the dark, dank watering holes and cheap motels of the Southwest. You'll enjoy reading this book if you know the smell of stale beer, the fear and pressure of \"mattering\" in the world, living in a town where everyone is more desperate than the next guy. My only issue with Motel Life is that Vlautin constricts his storytelling too much to his narrator's voice, and may exclude some readers who don't initially empathize. He solved that problem in his newest novel, The Free, because his omniscient narrator is allowed a wider palette to speak and reflect, and outliers are more easily invited in. I loved Vlautin's peripheral comments on literacy -- Jerry Lee, through all his painful life, is sustained by his brother's storytelling. And when he wants to make amends with a family he feels he's destroyed, he gives them a hard-won $1000, but also, subscriptions to a variety of magazines, because \"most people like magazines.\" That just sits there on the page without armor, and make of it what you will. What I made of it, and other subtle descriptors, is that Jerry Lee was redeemable, was the guy who could have turned things around, had deep goodness and an eye for beauty, if he'd just had the space to follow it, and the tragedy is he couldn't realize it for himself. The hope we're left with is that his brother will."}, {"userName": "Tfitoby", "userReviewDate": "Aug 26, 2012", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/5454475-tfitoby", "userReview": "I hoped this would be good, I was disappointed.

The people who fall through the cracks. The people who don't really belong anywhere. The people who never really had a chance in life. The Flannigan boys are those types of people. Their father has a severe gambling problem and shouldn't be living in Reno. After accumulating a huge debt, he leaves and their mother dies while they are still in their teens. They don't want to go to foster care so they decided to fly under the radar. They don't want to attract attention. When the oldest boy has an accident and has to go to the hospital, they don't avail themselves of the free health care that would have been available because of their age and spend their savings. From then on there is no cushion. Any hopes or aspirations they had are gone and now it's just a struggle to survive. Reno has a very seedy underbelly. I went to the University of Nevada, Reno, and there is so much more than the casinos. The casinos almost have a separate life from the rest of the town. The author talks about the Basque cooking which is one of the best things about living there. There are lots of mom and pop motels left over from Reno was the divorce capitol of the USA. Although the author talks about Fitzgerald's Casino, he doesn't talk about the back story of it which is such a great story. This book made Reno come to life for me and brought a flood of memories. We all know stories like Jerry Lee and Frank's. People who just never had a chance for whatever reason. It breaks your heart.

This is one of them. A tale of lives of quiet desperation, two brothers trying to get by in a cruel and largely indifferent world. It's a slice of americana, very moving and affecting story about how much of a struggle day to day living can be. Set in and around Reno, Nevada, it does feature a fair share of motels and from a very informative author's interview additional features in the back of the book the reader can see just how much of real Reno Vlautin brings to life with this story.

They lost their parents when they were young, they've lost their chances at making something of themselves, they lost their house, Frank lost his girlfriend and Jerry Lee lost his leg; now they're stuck in Reno, surviving from day to day in any way they can, drinking far too much and hanging onto their dreams not because they have any illusions about them coming true anymore but just because it seems to be all that's left. Until Jerry Lee bursts into Frank's room one night, inconsolable, and tells him he got behind the wheel after one drink too many, ran over a kid and now he doesn't know what to do. And all the things in their lives that have remained at a shaky status quo for years suddenly get put to the test. And us, we took the bad luck and strapped it around our feet like concrete. We did the worst imaginable thing you could do. We ran away.Vlautin's debut novel has a fantastic sense of... presence. He plants his reader right in the narrator Frank's head as he tries to save his brother and himself, in a succinct but incredibly descriptive prose. You could make much of the similarities to American storytellers like Carver, Denis Johnson or Yates, and the dustjacket does, repeatedly; but at the same time, Vlautin is a musician as well and The Motel Life reminds me of nothing so much as some song Tom Waits should have written - perhaps \"Burma Shave\", the story of a young girl who hitches a ride with Elvis Presley's ghost and ends up dead in a ditch to the tune of \"Summertime\", or \"Christmas Card From A Hooker In Minneapolis\", or \"9th and Hennepin\"... it's all dingy bars, used car lots and empty whiskey bottles, but also a set of characters that for all their fucked-up lives never come across as clich\u00e9d white trash jokes. Vlautin genuinely loves his losers and wants them to make it even though both he and his readers know they probably won't, and there is something beautiful in all of them. Jerry Lee draws every part of his life in black and white, and Frank keeps telling elaborate stories that all seem like fictional variations on his own life and dreams; anything to stay alive. Look, here's a piece of advice. I don't know if it's any good or not for you, you're the only one who'll know if it is. What you got to do is think about the life you want, think about it in your head. Make it a place where you want to be; a ranch, a beach house, a penthouse on the top of a skyscraper. It doesn't matter what it is, but a place that you can hide out in. When things get rough, go there. And if you find a place and it quits working, just change it. (...) Hope is the key. You can make shit up, there's no law against that. Make up some place you and your brother can go if you want. It might not work, but it might. Ain't too hard to try.And it does work, if not always for Frank then at least for Vlautin. Sure, there's a few points where you wonder just how much more he is going to put his characters through the wringer, but he always stays on just the right side of melodrama... after all, what is a good country song but a series of just slightly exaggerated everyday stories set to music that tugs at something in your chest? Willy Vlautin knows how to make a typewriter sound like a weeping pedal steel guitar, I just got to know Frank and Jerry Lee better than I might have wanted to, and it breaks my fucking heart."}, {"userName": "Andy Weston", "userReviewDate": "May 26, 2016", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/313206-andy-weston", "userReview": "Willy Vlautin's superb short novel can be seen as an advert for education. Frank narrates, and tells many stories, but chiefly about his brother Jerry Lee and their months after an accident. Both dropped out of school early after the death of their mother. They both have talent though, Jerry Lee as an artist, and Frank as a storyteller. There is subtle black humour throughout and their road trip and motel life is made more compelling by the Reno backdrop. The characters that pass through the brothers' lives during this time are wonderfully described. In that brief paragraph, you are feeling that you know them, or certainly would want to. Frank's stories, however ridiculous, are very special also. A review I read quoted Vlautin as being the literary equivalent of Shane McGowan and Tom Waites. Certainly Waites must be a major influence for him. But for me the analogy is with Willie Nelson who is mentioned and played frequently by the brothers. I not sure why it's taken me so long to read Vlautin, but I will go through his back catalogue pretty quickly now, unfortunately it isn't that big."}, {"userName": "Brian Foley", "userReviewDate": "Dec 11, 2007", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/537249-brian-foley", "userReview": "This is one of the best novels I read this year, and one of the best I've read in a long time.

You never got the sense the author was rubbing your face in it, or winking at you. It was bleak and beautiful and one hell of a first book. I only give it four stars as it was very classic.

It\u2019s one of the only certain truths. It\u2019s always on deck, it\u2019s always just waiting.

But I knew then, that morning, when I saw the kid\u2019s frozen arms in the back of the car that bad luck had found my brother and me. And us, we took the bad luck and strapped it around our feet like concrete. We did the worst imaginable thing you could do. We ran away. We just got in to his beat-up 1974 Dodge Fury and left.\u2019Here\u2019s a book I\u2019d like you to try. It\u2019s my third Willy Vlautin novel in a fairly short period of time and it seems I got there and went in the wrong direction, this being his first. It matters not a jot that I haven\u2019t worked in sequence \u2013 I\u2019d have read all of three by now no matter where I\u2019d started. The guy has a knack for writing stories that I love and telling them in a way that I find utterly compelling. In \u2018The Motel Life\u2019 we meet up with a couple of brothers. Frank\u2019s first, suffering from a severe hangover when a duck flies through his motel window and then his brother turns up with news that he\u2019s run over a boy in the middle of the night and has his body in the car. Even though there was nothing that Jerry Lee could have done to prevent the accident, he\u2019s riddled with guilt and the guilt only seems to want to grow.The pair set off on the road hoping to escape the law and to avoid any kind of retribution.What follows is a remarkable tale. It\u2019s remarkable in the sense that it doesn\u2019t follow any linear storytelling. As they young men move forward the story also moves back to the past to let us know how they came to be here in the first place. This skipping back and forth builds up a wonderful, multi-layered picture that quickly becomes three dimensional rather than flat. Needless to say, these stories are bleak and full of pain, but they\u2019re also full of life and a strong sense of the way the people who inhabit the tales cope with the luck that\u2019s dealt their way.To add to this, there\u2019s another tier of story-telling. Frank Flannigan happens to make up his own tales. Sometimes he writes them down for his brother to read when he\u2019s passing time, others he just tells the ones he\u2019s been working on or old favourites depending on the mood. These stories offer escape and comfort to those who listen as well as to Frank. They are occasionally in the current situation and always seem to have a bearing on the present. Importantly to those who hear them, they usually have a grain of hope. It\u2019s that trace of hope that allows them all to keep going.Vlautin has an easy style. The voice is natural and poetic and really makes me want to listen. It\u2019s this, above all, that has raised the guy into the position of being one of my all-time favourites. Given that it seems so effortless, I\u2019m also incredible jealous of the man\u2019s talent. I\u2019ll be trying to hold off from reading his latest, The Free, for as long as I can, but don\u2019t think it will be long. When I\u2019m done, I\u2019ll be left waiting for him to write afresh. I guess I could always try his music while I\u2019m waiting.A brilliant book that took my breath away more than once and then put it back again every time."}, {"userName": "Ryan Madman Reads & Rocks ", "userReviewDate": "Dec 03, 2017", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/45393113-ryan-madman-reads-rocks", "userReview": "My complete review can be found at:https://youtu.be/iEHNfSY0sQ8"}, {"userName": "Matt North", "userReviewDate": "Sep 26, 2011", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/6453468-matt-north", "userReview": "I bought this novel upon a recommendation of a friend after listening to Vlautin's band Richmond Fontaine and whilst I have never been a big reader, this book alone has kick-started a passion I wish I'd found long ago.The Motel Life is a beautifully, yet simply narrated tale about the ties and bonds that are formed in brotherhood, with a true and honest outlook on life.

Part of the problem is Vlautin's singing voice, which is raspy and weary in that whiskey-soaked kind of way that usually appeals to me, but is also oddly bland, with little differentiation in range or tone from track to track. His music just kind of washes over me. It's pleasant enough to listen to but hardly memorable, and I can't focus on it long enough to absorb lyrical content.Which is probably why I resisted reading Vlautin's novel, The Motel Life for years following its release. Based on his music, I just didn't think the guy had it in him to sustain my interest for a book's worth of pages. Recently, though, I've been trying to write fiction myself, and so my interest in local writers has been reinvigorated. I picked up Motel Life at Powell's, started reading it, and within minutes was utterly hooked. Vlautin's prose is deceptively simple, unfettered by big words, but only because its from the point of view of a character, Frank Flannagan, who doesn't use big words. The book's been compared to Bukowski (and Vlautin himself is an enormous fan), but Vlautin's writing is far more interesting than Bukowski's because his characters actually have depth and he tells a story that goes somewhere and has twists and turns that surprise without beating you over the head with their cleverness. I love that the book's main catalyst is a complete accident, as Frank's brother, Jerry Lee, hits a kid on his bike with his car. Neither Jerry Lee nor Frank are bad guys (in fact their inherent sweetness and their love and affection for each other is perhaps the book's strongest element), but they're not the brightest bulbs on the tree either, and their first impulse upon learning of the kid's death is to run.A lesser writer I feel would have Jerry Lee kill someone with his own hands on accident, like in a fight, and then have the two brothers flee across the country, cops in pursuit. Instead Jerry Lee and Frank return to Reno, where Motel Life takes place, and try to keep on living their decrepit lives. Frank gets a dog. They drink a lot. Jerry Lee gets more and more depressed and shoots himself in the leg because he's too chicken-shit to kill himself. Vlautin mixes stories from the brothers' past into the slow-burning narrative with admirable skill. You begin to know them and care about them so much you become interested in seeing them walk to the liquor store, or get drunk on a back porch. Great writing is like life: Reading it, you don't even realize you've grown to love its characters until something befalls them and you feel their pain. Vlautin's writing snuck up on me, and it wasn't until the final pages, when Jerry Lee says, \"I want to fall in love and have someone fall in love with me... Do you think that's so wrong to want? I mean, after what's happened?\" that I realized how deeply he was getting to me.Then only thing that keeps me from giving this thing five stars is Vlautin's device of Frank telling Jerry Lee stories to cheer him up. Frank's stories-within-the-story are long and convoluted and intentionally random and ridiculous. They're sort of funny I suppose, but paled in comparison to the intense, beautiful power of the book's main narrative, and I found myself getting impatient with them and wanting things to get back to what mattered. The dynamic of Frank telling Jerry Lee stories is important and touching, but Vlautin didn't need to spend pages and pages on each one; it's cruel of him to take us away from the main action for that long. This element and the book's ending, which wrapped up way, way too quickly, keep the book from receiving a perfect score from me. What remains is immensely good though>"}, {"userName": "Mark Stevens", "userReviewDate": "Aug 31, 2014", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/2410049-mark-stevens", "userReview": "Willy Vlautin writes like he\u2019s searching for the unvarnished, cold truth in each moment.

He\u2019s the dry-eyed documentarian. Looking for flashy prose? Seek elsewhere. Vlautin\u2019s touch as a musician (he writes and sings for the band Richmond Fontaine) is evident in the rhythms and flow.But that doesn\u2019t mean these books lack energy. They don\u2019t.

Indeed, there are portions of his story that bring a tear to the reader's eye, but there are also scenes of humor and even optimism. That being said, I cannot yet place him on the pedestal of the writers (Steinbeck, Carver, O'Connor) that he is most frequently compared to (most of whom are also his proclaimed influences). Like his predecessors, he is no doubt adept at creating short, sharp and meaningful sentences- however he seems to disregard the infamous \"tip of the iceberg\" philosopy, instead adopting more of a naturalistic voice. By the end of the novel, we know enough about his character(s) to have determined the outcome. What Mr. Vlautin needs to work on is adding more of a sense of mystery to his writing."}, {"userName": "Eliza Rapsodia", "userReviewDate": "Nov 10, 2011", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/6561375-eliza-rapsodia", "userReview": "En el peque\u00f1o pueblo de Reno en Nevada, Estados Unidos, viven dos hermanos: Jerry Lee y Frank Flannigan.

A friend had told me that she liked this book, so I bought it too. I know Willy from college (we lived in the same dorm at U of O. We went out on one date!). I was happy to see that he still plays the guitar (he's part of the band Richmond Fontaine) and he played a little bit after he read from his book.I liked this book, but DAMN! it is depressing. I like that the book portrays the lives of contingent people whose lives are so in flux. I really like the characters and the book is well written. Besides the fact that it is a little bleak, there were parts of the book I liked less (like the stories Frank tells his brother, some of the portrayals of women), but overall the book is very good.Would I recommend it? Yes. But you have to know it's not a happy picture of life. It's realistic."}, {"userName": "Alexandra", "userReviewDate": "Aug 29, 2011", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/6111136-alexandra", "userReview": "It was a quick and easy read that felt like watching a movie, with a lot of references to Reno. The author is originally from Reno, and the entire book takes place in Reno and Elko. It felt ethnographically true in the culture it presented, that of lower-income working class young men living in a motel and drinking beer. Though the characters were not highly educated, they were intelligent. I could imagine living in a motel, but probably romanticize it to make it feel like a run-by the moment, go to work, and kick back with a beer joking around, not worrying all that much. The characters do go through a huge worry, but it doesn't go into long descriptions of the internal processes of their worrying."}, {"userName": "Malbadeen", "userReviewDate": "Jan 07, 2008", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/128745-malbadeen", "userReview": "*disclaimer can be seen in the first 2 paragraphs of this reviewhttp://www.goodreads.com/review/show/...2 adolescent, semi-orphaned, boys get caught up in a hit and run and muddle their way through the aftermath. the structure of the story was interesting, one of the brothers told elaborate, and sometimes hilarious in their ridiculousness, stories to people in times of stress to calm things.

Moe is my fave Simpson character, so maybe that partially explains my love for this beautiful, sad fucking book. The other part of the explanation is just that it's a pretty special book. I was afraid going into it that it would be unbearably depressing, but it wasn't. Depressing, yes . . . but just squeaks by as BARELY bearable. I did find myself with tears dripping down my face a few times, but they were gritty and slow and tiredly sweet, not headache-inducing wailers.It felt very American, very WESTERN American and like it could have taken place any time between 1930 and the present (even though there are real events that place it in one specific time period)."}, {"userName": "Adam", "userReviewDate": "Sep 09, 2010", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/214053-adam", "userReview": "Willie Vlautin has an optimistic view of humanity, which should be weird statement considered how filled with violence, drug and alcohol abuse, sadness, anxiety, grinding poverty, accidents, and injury his books are.
