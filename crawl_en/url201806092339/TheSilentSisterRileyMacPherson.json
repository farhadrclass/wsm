( gotta love the library Overdrive... keeps improving too)  Easy Listening..... easy to follow ....engaging ... not earth-shattering fantastic....but I enjoyed turning in to this station. The narrator's voice was 'very pleasant' - and held my attention. I was a happy camper!!! I guess I'd call this mystery-light! Lisa, a musical prodigy on the violin, age 16, is assumed dead..... having committed suicide many years ago.....after having committed murder, and before her court date. So... rather than a 'whodunit' mystery, it's more a 'whydunit' mystery. The reader is always wondering 'why' .... why did Lisa kill herself? Or did she? They never found her body. Why or why not? What I enjoyed was the comfortable easy tone --- my emotions were never TOO HIGH or TOO LOW.... or TOO CRITICAL.I was peacefully happy enough being 'read to'.....while soaking in the pool, walking, cooking, or resting in the sauna. Every time I listened to this audiobook-- it felt like I had a little friend with me 'chatting-away'. ...., telling me a story! Duh! lol I WAS being told a story. Everything was breezy engaging-- nice brain teaser relaxer....( both). Let's face it.... it's a different type of listening to then \"Truman\" or \"The \"Destiny of the Republic\". I still have a LONG way to go with Truman -- but one more long walk - and I'm almost done with \"Destiny of the Republic\"... One part was soooo exciting - I scream to the trees and cheered! - But back to Diane Chamberlain's novel....Riley & Danny ( brother and sister), are two characters you will get to know well. They are very different--- but ( for me)---I never spent 'any' time judging either one of them. I simply was 'engaged' in knowing WHO THEY WERE - WHY THEY WERE THE WAY THEY WERE. I'm sure credit belongs to author Diane Chamberlain--but I have a hunch I might not have like this book is much 'without' the audiobook. Everything about the woman's voice blended beautifully with my extremely busy tasks ... haha while audio-enjoying!!!I plan to try another 'written' book by Diane Chamberlain. I had only read one: a huge surprise-- to win \"Necessary Lies\", as a Goodreads give-a-way years go .... and the book blew my mind it was so great. I learned a lot & loved it. My next Chamberlain book \"The Midwife's Confession\" .... comes recommended to me by KAS. I happen to have a paper copy in the house. So....I'll test out Chamberlain again. KAS says it's one of the authors best books! This one... 4 stars for pure engaging story.

Mmm...yes, a bit too much, but really, this violin in this tale had this mysterious story to tell: \"Hi, my name is Violet, Violet MacPherson, the only member of this family, apart from Lisa who committed suicide at the age of sixteen, who knows what really happened and it is not what you think! Yes,there was ice on the river, and a murder, and then silence.....until now! So hear me out, this is my story, Riley MacPherson. Danny, you need to know as well, whether you like it or not. Come. Let's talk about your dad, your mom and Lisa.\" Heartbreaking and shocking. Endearing and passionate. Possible and impossible. It's all elements in the narrative covering the lives of three people surviving a fatal event in their lives. All the characters in the book were simultaneously bad and good. It is called being human. And all of them can be forgiven.I LOVED this book. Recommended in UPPER CASE to those who enjoy family dramas with a mysterious twist. The plot is a prime example of an irrational common sense that I would gladly subscribe to. And this is where I get off and leave you wondering. Read the official blurb if you want to know more.

Well, in Diane Chamberlain's The Silent Sister Riley MacPherson finds that the stories she's been told of her sister, believed to have committed suicide as a teenager, just may in fact be alive. How's that for a huge family secret?Riley is trying to clean out her father's home when a series of events lead her to believe that she may in fact want to investigate her past. At the age of 25, all the people she could ask were long gone. Her mother died when she was young, her father recently deceased, and Danny, her brother, are all unable to answer the questions she desperately needs answering. That is until Riley delves a little deeper into the mystery that is her family. I've never read any other books by Diane Chamberlain and I'm not sure what I expected, but this novel reads like chick-lit. That is fine and dandy if that's what you're in the mood for, but I definitely wasn't which is unfortunate because The Silent Sister is actually gripping from the beginning. We are introduced to Riley, a social worker, who based her whole career choice as a social worker on a sister she hasn't known since she was two years old. She's even patient with her brother Danny who suffers from some form of PTSD after having been wounded in Iraq.There are a few things I found wrong with this book which makes it impossible for me to give it more than 2-stars. And sadly, it's not because of the writing which is not bad at all. It's simply so darn predictable this novel. From beginning to end it is predictable. The characters, even Riley, are paper thin, and I almost felt like one storyline (with the crazy RV park couple) was too neatly tossed away and sewn up. I mean... it can't be that easy to get out of a contract is it?Anyway, The Silent Sister may not have been a great read for me, I certainly wouldn't say it's not worth a gander especially if women's literature is your thing. It's usually my thing, but I expected more of a mystery-type thriller with a hint of chick-lit instead of the other way around. Overall, I would definitely read more by this author.

I want to thank St. Martin's Press for the gift.This novel was a real pleasant surprise for me. I usually read thrillers, but I entered the Giveaway contest for this book as the plot looked interesting. It wasn't long before I was pulled into the story and was totally engrossed thereafter. I read the book in 4 days which is really fast for me. I will not re-summarize the plot, only to say that the author does an excellent job in depicting the potentially devastating consequences when family members are not honest with each other. Ms. Chamberlain is a talented writer, and the prose flowed nicely, especially with the short chapters. I liked the way the POV switched often between Riley and Jade; this was never confusing as the chapters were well-labelled. This technique resulted in excellent character development of the two protagonists. I really felt myself getting involved in their plights and really caring what would happen to them. There was also quite a bit of time shifting, but again the reader was well-informed of the changes. I loved all the twists and turns. The two huge twists in the last third of the book really took me by surprise--kudos to Ms. Chamberlain for fooling me! The only negative in my opinion was the relatively abrupt ending. I wanted to know much more about the lives of Riley and Jade subsequent to the last chapter than the epilogue provided. This dropped my score from 5.0 to 4.5, but the book is closer to 5.0 than 4.0; thus, a 5 star rating from me. I had never read any of Ms. Chamberlain's books before this one, but based on how much I enjoyed A Silent Sister, I definitely plan to read more.

Usually this author does a good job writing women's fiction, aptly straddling the line between wringing excess emotion out of the reader and providing an interesting and quality plot.

While clearing out her father\u2019s possessions she finds out more than she bargained for about her father and also the sister who she barely remembers. Lisa was 17 when newspapers reported her death and Riley 2 so it is hardly surprising Riley doesn\u2019t remember her, especially when there seems to be so much mystery surrounding Lisa\u2019s apparent suicide. But could there be more to the story? There certainly is. Some families are good at covering up the truth and Riley\u2019s family had certainly done that. Riley\u2019s brother Danny is suffering from post traumatic stress that is not all to do with his tours in Iraq. He wants nothing to do with the family home or the past and certainly doesn\u2019t want to talk about Lisa, who he blames for the problems in his family.This story sucked me in as others of Diane Chamberlain\u2019s have done. Once I started I had to keep reading even though I had a fair idea I had figured out the family secrets. I was happy to be proved right. I liked the character of Riley but found Danny hard to get a handle on and I wasn\u2019t completely convinced by the way it left the end with Danny. Some of the characters are very unlikable but are necessary to the story while others are lovable and just as necessary to the plot.

I have enjoyed every book I\u2019ve read by Diane Chamberlain, but this is one of those I missed along the way. I recently saw Buzzfeed\u2019s list of the top most suspenseful books and this one was pretty far up on the list. So, I immediately went in search of a copy. (Once more my Overdrive library account proves invaluable!) Years ago, Lisa, a young musical prodigy with a bright future ahead of her, disappeared and is presumed dead, a victim of suicide. Her body was never found\u2026When Riley\u2019s father dies suddenly, she becomes the executor of his will because her older brother, Danny, is a war veteran with a host of issues. As she deals with the terms of her father\u2019s will and prepares to go through his personal papers and possessions in order to sell his place, she unearths a torrent of old family secrets, including the shocking truth surrounding her older sister\u2019s alleged suicide. When someone hints at the possibility her sister could still be alive, Riley becomes nearly obsessed with the notion of finding her, but if Lisa is still alive, and Riley manages to locate her, she could be putting her a very precarious position.This story was very complex and emotional, and except for a few too many strokes of luck and some implausible circumstances, and a couple of occasions where the story lost a little momentum, the book was near perfect. I don\u2019t know if I felt the level of suspense the book is supposed to trigger, but I did find it to be a top notch mystery and a very compelling family drama, that left me contemplating all that happened and believing that, yes, punishment and justice does come in all forms, even though I still felt a little conflicted by how everything played out. The characters are human, flawed, mysterious, vulnerable and weak in many ways, filled with pain, regret, anger, and sadness, but also full of love and hope. I can\u2019t say I understood Danny\u2019s intense anger, especially after he finally knows the whole truth, and his volatile nature is the only reason I was left with any residual feelings of unease. Riley is perhaps a little too na\u00efve, too easily manipulated, and sheltered which came back to bite her on a few occasions, but I really did like her. The secondary characters were well drawn, all doing their part to create the desired atmosphere and help weave this sordid tale of lies and secrets.

I am always able to connect with most of her characters, as they are \"real\" people. In this case Riley could be anyone I know....until her father dies and she comes to discover that her life is full of secrets and lies. Chamberlain tells this story through two voices. The present voice is Riley as she tries to discover if anything she grew up believing is true. The back story comes in the narrative of Lisa/Jade as she slowly fills in the pieces of the puzzle for the reader while Riley is fitting the puzzle together as well. Two narrators and two time frames don't always work, but Chamberlain moves from one to the other with ease and never misses a beat.  A few of the family secrets were easy for me to figure out, but then I had the benefit of hearing Lisa's story before Riley did. I though, along with Riley had trouble figuring out quite who to trust and believe. Chamberlain gives the reader a wonderful story of a young woman who's life is all made up of lies, is nothing that she has been led to believe and we struggle along with her as it all comes tumbling down.

This was good. I'm trying to decide on a final rating between 4 and 4.5 stars, but as per usual, Chamberlain really immersed me into the plight of the characters and overarching story. I couldn't put this book down, and I\"m really glad I had the chance to read it as a galley.Full review:\"The Silent Sister\" was yet another book of Diane Chamberlain's that engaged me from beginning to end. By that I mean it kept me guessing for events for a good part of the narrative. One thing to keep in mind with this book is that not everything is as it seems, and if Riley's family is any indication, there are many secrets running under the surface - painful ones that refuse to be acknowledged until she starts chipping away at unanswered questions and places in the past. Yet the question becomes just how much can Riley chip away at before everything she knows caves in around her.The story starts at a common point of grief. 25-year old Riley's father has died, her brother is a ball of unsettled anger towards a family that taught him to deny reality at a young age (and became even more substantial after his tours in the military). Riley is left to pick up the pieces and try to move on with her life as she tries to pack away her childhood home. Yet Riley uncovers findings in her father's home and settling his estate that lead her to questions about the sister she never knew - one who reportedly committed suicide in the midst of being on trial for murder. Yet some revelations suggest that there was more to Lisa's suicide than authorities thought to uncover. I liked the focus of detail and characterization between the multiple POVs in this novel. Riley writes from first person while Lisa/Jade's accounts are in third. This is a good example as to how dual narration can work really well, since Riley starts at a point of grief and dealing with her father's estate has her in contact with multiple parties - each of whom holds a complex piece of her past - one which she isn't sure she could face the collective truth for. Riley/Jade has her own harrowing experiences to follow, and they work well for creating sympathy for a character whose actions seem problematic, if not cause for concern.The two women are very different in personality, but intricately tied with one another and with their own respective flaws. I thought the first two thirds of the book were excellent, taking me along for the journey into the relationships and mystery surrounding their separation and how this all came to pass. I liked especially how Chamberlain managed to portray certain facts that were unknown by each of the characters and used that to heighten the tension for when certain revelations were handed down as the story progressed.The last third of the book seemed a little rushed, but still had an emotional coming to terms for the characters and resolution to each of the promises made by the narrative since the beginning of the work. Like Chamberlain's other works, I enjoyed the focus on the character interactions, being drawn into their situations and emotions, and following the mystery that built with the respective tensions overall. Well worth the time spent.Overall score: 4/5 stars.Note: I received this as an ARC from NetGalley, from St. Martin's Press."}, {"userName": "Britany", "userReviewDate": "Jun 02, 2014", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/5550397-britany", "userReview": "Riley MacPherson has lost her entire family in one form or another; she heads back to New Bern, NC to wrap up things after her father's death.

I did enjoy the characters. I did want to get to the end and find out what happened. However, there were some very irritating aspects to this book. It seemed very contradictory, first Riley wants everything out of her father's house and when she is pushed into doing that, she hates every aspect of what the ppl she hired are doing, namely going through years of her father's collections to get ready for sale. She didn't seem like she could make up her mind. And I know she was grieving and that is probably the whole point, but it seemed for her to take forever for her to kick those two obnoxious people out of her house! And I really hated the impression that the author gave of the character Jeannie, because at first she seems totally creepy and I thought for sure that Riley was going to be ripped off, but no, she turns out to be a central character and very important to the story. I couldn't, however, get rid of that first impression of her being somehow not criminal or nefarious, so it was really hard to like her. Even when she turned out okay. Also, the couple from the RV park just kind of dropped off the face of the earth. And I know with the kind of character that man was, that there was NO way he would have ever let that go. But we never find out...I also had predicted the ending way before she ever FINALLY got there. And I was like, yep, knew it. Probably could have skipped a bunch of chapters and just read the end.

While there, she gets sucked into the secret past of their family. She discovers that her sister Lisa did not commit suicide as her parents told her, but had escaped a murder trial with the help of their father. The story starts off with a lot of suspense and interest but fizzles out in the middle. The end is a disaster, leaving practically every question unresolved. Lisa's story could have been intriguing, but I found the woman really stupid and annoying. Her story was watered down and everything came too easy for her. After running away, she slept all alone for one night on the beach and one night in a seedy motel, but was whisked away to a fairy tale cottage by a do-gooder immediately afterwards. Her terror should have communicated itself to the reader, but there was none of it, because good samaritans at every step. Another thing that the author hurried on was the relationship between Celia and Lisa. A couple of meetings and they are in a relationship? The reader never gets the sense of how their relationship develops. Living a lie while building a relationship is incredibly taxing, but there was none of that in the book. Lisa was also incredibly stupid. The one thing her father had told her was not to touch a violin ever again because her music would be easily recognisable. And the first thing she does is to buy a violin and start playing it. She even joins a band! How stupid can you get? Is this the way you repay a father who risked prison time to help you escape? I also found the completely uncomplicated love of Lisa towards Riley a tad unbelievable. She was raped and had a child from that incident, and it's all okay because BABY! She was a child herself! How about some conflict of feelings and some tough decisions on how she handled the problems caused by such a situation? And what kind of parents would not try and investigate about the situation when their child is pregnant? I would suspect abuse the first thing, especially since she vehemently denied it was her boyfriend's child. Why didn't these people? I think this part was handled terribly. The various plots did not tie up well at all. Jeannie and her daughter showed up all creepy and pushy, but it all turned out to be absolutely nothing. Tom and Verniece Kyle were desperate enough to do anything to get the campsite in their name, but in the end, they just faded out of the picture. Danny faded out at the end as well, in spite of him opposing Riley throughout the book.The end was pretty mediocre. Lisa and Riley meet up and live happily ever after. Really? What about the crime Lisa committed? What about people who could still recognise her? What about exposing a paedophile like Steven Davis, which could even be easily proved? What about ethics? Doesn't anyone have a responsibility to expose Davis, whom the world thinks of as an innocent music teacher brutally murdered by a crazy teenager? Like, anyone at ALL?"}, {"userName": "Denise", "userReviewDate": "Jun 02, 2014", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/2657711-denise", "userReview": "3 out of 5 stars - \"Everyone has a scar.\"Riley MacPherson returns to her childhood home to clear out the house and settle the estate of her recently deceased father. Her brother, Danny, injured in Iraq and living in a trailer on the fringe of the RV park the family owns, refuses to help her. He's embittered and angry because of the fallout from their sister's suicide when he and Riley were children and he never got over it. All Riley wants to do is have a relationship with her brother now that the two are orphaned and alone. But, she discovers that her father was keeping s very huge secret. Fans of women's fiction centering on family drama will be the likely readers of this newest novel by author Diane Chamberlain. I've read every single one of her books and keep hoping for one that takes me back to the thrill and satisfaction I felt when reading THE SECRET LIFE OF CEE CEE WILKES. I keep waiting for an intense relationship story and some real intrigue and mystery, but this book is lacking both. The tale is contrived, melodramatic, predictable and filled with what I felt to be completely one-dimensional unlikeable characters. That's right -- there was absolutely no one in the book that I developed a connection with or ultimately cared what happened to them. The whole narrative seemed so ludicrous, far-fetched and filled with so much co-incidence that even my usual ability to suspend disbelief was sorely tested. The ending was so pat that it was not remotely satisfying. I really would give this book 2.5 stars at best because I was so disappointed again, but I know that anyone who likes books by Jodi Picoult, Mary Kay Andrews, Kristen Hannah and other writers of this genre will disagree with that rating. Perhaps it is me, and I should stay away from women's fiction.

The suspense builds and rarely lets up in the page turner.What was Jeannie\u2019s relationship with Riley\u2019s father, and why is she so eager to remove certain items from the house? Who is Fred Marcus, and what is his connection to Frank? Why did Riley\u2019s father include one of the trailer park tenants in his will, and why was he writing the guy monthly checks? Who can be trusted? And the biggest question of all: What really happened the night Lisa disappeared?

I fell in love with the story in the first sentence and it held my attention throughout. The storyline was incredible. How the author thought of some of the scenes is beyond me. Some parts of the plot were so surprising that I just had to shake my head. The story is essentially (and I'm not one to repeat the book summary - that's been done) about a dysfunctional family that has not grown past the trauma of losing the eldest sister, Lisa, to suicide many years ago. Riley, who was 2 at the time of the suicide, loses her father and comes back home to settle his estate. And that's where it begins. The twists and turns are plentiful and the characters fit their roles perfectly. It is a book I could read again and find more details that I missed in the first read.Highly recommended to everyone.

Let's explore.The core of the novel is promising: Riley (our protagonist) is cleaning out the home of her late father and 'discovers evidence' that her sister, who everyone thinks committed suicide, might be alive. She embarks on a journey to discover her family's past.That tidy little nugget of synopsis is stretched to a degree of agonizing attenuation over the course of the novel. The reader is forced to wade through a swamp of meaningless information - the father collected pipes, the brother likes to hunt, the suspicious girlfriend has a daughter who is recovering from a drug problem. If any of this information ever became in any way relevant to the plot or narrative, it would be redeemable. Instead, the book is nothing more than a drunk and companionless Aunt, who insists upon reporting on the affairs of all of her friends and colleagues - none of whom you will ever meet or care about in the slightest.Do not be fooled into thinking that these characters contain multitudes - or, indeed, that they contain even a single multitude between the lot of them. False character development litters the novel like a trapdoor in the back of a hall closet: you peer at it, wondering where it might lead, but when you lift the latch, all you see are pipes and dust.More at http://readspoilers.blogspot.com/2015..."}], "description": "In The Silent Sister, Riley MacPherson has spent her entire life believing that her older sister Lisa committed suicide as a teenager.
