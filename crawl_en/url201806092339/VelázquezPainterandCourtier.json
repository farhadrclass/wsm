Provides a cursory but intriguing glance at Count-Duke Olivares, the tragic Richelieu figure to Philip IV, who could not reform the inherent defects of the Spanish state quickly enough despite his Herculean efforts.As for Velazquez? Wow! His talent was spotted early on and so benefited from a broad humanist education obtained from one of the leading lights in Seville, Francisco Pacheco, whose circle of erudite intellectuals facilitated Velazquez' entree to Philip's court in Madrid. Brown's book charts the artist's transformations in style and technique as well as the lucky breaks he enjoyed that gained for him patronage at the very highest levels of a rigidly stratified society. It seems like for many knowledge workers (like me) development sometimes proceeds patchily, like some kind of condensed individuated punctuated equilibrium model, where long periods of calm stasis are interrupted by brief phases of salutary and often tumultuous change. For Velazquez, his apprenticeship under Pacheco, a months-long encounter with Rubens, and a journey to Italy, were catalysts of profound change. Velazquez didn't have half the chutzpah that Rubens had but was probably, in my untrained eyes, twice the innovator. Velazquez remained faithful to the humanist tenets learned from Pacheco but constantly enlarged his circle of contacts, and worked on his technique to the point where people studied him, a fitting denouement for a genius."}, {"userName": "sologdin", "userReviewDate": "Jun 23, 2011", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/5610133-sologdin", "userReview": "difficult not to like velazquez as an artist. appreciation will of course be aided by Las Meninas, made famous among cultural theory losers like me by Foucault's The Order of Things."}, {"userName": "alice", "userReviewDate": "May 19, 2010", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/2969872-alice", "userReview": "This isn't just a great art book to look at but a great one to read.
