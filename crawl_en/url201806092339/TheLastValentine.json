In the style of (The Notebook), a heartbreaker with flashbacks to the second World War, religious undertones and a love story that knows no bounds. Betty White starred in the Hallmark movie version of this which is how I first became aware of the story. I liked the book even better though, even if it did jump around a lot with different time periods and up to 10 POV's including some very minor secondary characters. The battle scenes from the Philippians were particularly well done.As well as the main 1940\u2019s war time romance we\u2019re also given a modern day older man/younger woman second chance romance (as the son of our couple tells his parents love story to a TV reporter) I enjoyed it equally as much.The Last Valentine is just an all-round, beautiful, albeit bittersweet love story that left me believing in magic, requiring some tissues and unable to forget.

Where would we be without that first moment of two strangers realizing they are soul mates. Now add put in a war to keep the lovers apart from their happily ever after and you either get a tragedy or you get schmaltz. The Last Valentine by James Michael Pratt is the latter.February 14, 1944 Caroline Thomas says goodbye to her husband as he ships off the Pacific. They last embrace at Union Station in Los Angeles and he promises to be back in a year. Every year after that Caroline goes to the station to wait even though there is no evidence that he has survived the war. In the present, Caroline's son from that very short marriage tells this story of eternal love to a local television reporter and together they witness the miraculous return of the missing husband. Because of course twoo wuv transcends everything.The World War Two pieces of the book are interesting. As a historical novel, The Last Valentine is pretty good. The details are convincing and the coverage of the war has some dramatic moments. Likewise, the reporter's skeptical approach the son's story has some mystery and could have been fine by itself. The weaving of the two together with the over-wrought theme of true love didn't work for me.If Caroline and Neil had known each other longer and been married longer their love for each other would have felt more real. Caroline's devotion to a husband she knew only for a few months doesn't explain why after fifty years of waiting she hasn't moved on with her life. I know that present day me with nearly two decades of shard experiences with my husband would be far more willing to wait for him to return if he disappeared than I would have been at the start of our relationship.

I feel inclined to explain myself:My creative writing professor/mentor had given me a constructive criticism about my writing, well more about me as a person. \u201cCherylann, you have one problem: You are allergic to sentimentality.\u201d What I wanted to say was, \u201cSo?\u201d but if this lack of emotion was negatively affecting my writing, I couldn\u2019t afford to just ignore it. As much as I\u2019d like to say I have reached my ultimate potential in creative writing, I really can\u2019t. I also respect/adore my mentor, so instead of \u201cSo?\u201d I said, \u201cHow can I fix it?\u201dShe had a rather odd assignment for me: Read a sappy romance novel. I was picturing the books in the romantic section of Borders (R.I.P) with the women in clingy nightgowns and the half naked glistening centaur-men on the cover. She quickly clarified that she meant a \u201csweet\u201d novel, not an erotic one. Well, this book was the sappiest looking one I could find. It has some old looking love letters with a thornless rose covering them on the cover. The contents of the book were no more promising than the cover. The characters were utterly inhuman, every situation more clich\u00e9 than the next. The parallel love stories just about threw me over the edge. Not only was the plot boring, I didn\u2019t even care what happened to the characters. Unfortunately I cannot stop reading a book once I have started, a \u201cvirtue\u201d my 4th grade teacher Mr. Ito instilled in me at an early age. Once I reached the last scene, the whole \u201cgoing into the light\u201d one I actually had to put it away for a few minutes, literally put it out of my sight, The only consolation was I didn\u2019t waste money buying this book, I checked it out from the library. I may be allergic to sentimentality; however if there is any caring in my cold, black heart, this certainly was not the book that could squeeze it out of me. In order to become sentimental about a character, that character has to be somewhat real. These characters were stagnant and typical.

By the second chapter I knew the two main characters would end up falling in love and living happily ever after. But- that is the sort of book that I enjoy so I liked it. It was an easy read, I got through it without a problem and I never dreaded reading it but I never encountered a time where I couldn't put it down. It gave some good historical information about WW1 while incorporating not one but two love stories. I liked that the book was told from two different time periods, it made it a little more interesting, gave some different insight into what was happening, and made it easier to understand the families history. The characters were easy to love, as they all had great personalities. So overall, I recommend this book- but if and only if it is the type of book you're looking for (a beach read chick-flick), as I feel that is the only way a person can enjoy it."}, {"userName": "Lisa", "userReviewDate": "Mar 22, 2011", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/418158-lisa", "userReview": "I'm a cheesy kind of girl, but this book was a bit too cheesy, even for me. ;) Still, it was a nice, quick read, with a good message about love. 3.5 stars.I'm looking forward to watching the movie now.Update 3/25/11:I just watched the movie, which was a real tear jerker.

Ero sposata da poco ed aspettavo il mio primo figlio...ricordo che mentre leggevo questa stupenda storia d'amore tra il marinaio Neil e la giovane Caroline, ho sentito il cuore stringersi dentro al petto ed il solo pensiero di vedere il mio amore partire lontano, verso una guerra dove le possibilit\u00e0 di ritornare erano poche, mi struggeva... Lo scrittore aveva saputo cogliere il dolore di Caroline, lo aveva trascritto ed era riuscito a trasmettermelo. Ed oggi che l'ho riletto ho provato le stesse cose, forse in modo pi\u00f9 maturo e diverso ma comunque ho provato emozioni forti! Caroline aspetter\u00e0 il suo amore per cinquant'anni alla stazione dove si dissero addio prima di partire per le isole Caroline, durante la seconda guerra mondiale; ogni 14 febbraio, il giorno di San Valentino e data del loro anniversario di nozze,Caroline immancabilmente attende Neil alla stazione, aspettando un miracolo. L'amore che provano queste due persone \u00e8 un amore puro, eterno, incorruttibile e leggerlo mi ha fatto credere ancora di pi\u00f9 che \u00e8 possibile amarsi per sempre se si ha la forza e la voglia di superare anche uno scoglio insormontabile che pu\u00f2 essere la lontananza o la guerra stessa. Attraverso delle lettere, Neil e Caroline continuano ad esprimere il loro amore cercando di risollevarsi a vicenda il morale ma senza mai mentire sulla cruda realt\u00e0 della guerra.Non basta dirti \"Ti amo\" Caroline! Torner\u00f2, vedrai. Ti amo pi\u00f9 di quanto possa esprimere e ti amer\u00f2 per sempre, come ci siamo promessi. Il tuo devoto marito, NeilLo scrittore ha un modo diretto e semplice di scrivere, ed ho apprezzato molto la descrizione della guerra dai punti di vista di Neil, il quale era \"dentro\" la guerra e la viveva in prima linea e dal punto di vista di Caroline, che viveva la guerra da fuori, lontano dal fronte. Un libro da leggere magari proprio a San Valentino, un libro dove l'amore trionfa sempre nonostante tutto.Che dire della bellezza di una rosa e del suo profumo? Ecco un altro esempio per il concetto che sto cercando di spiegarti. Sappiamo che sono i boccioli a emanare la fragranza, ma pensa allo stelo. Ti accorgerai che nessun bocciolo si apre finch\u00e9 le spine, quelle cosette fastidiose che ci pungono e ci fanno sanguinare, non sono completamente formate. \u00c8 come se la pianta dicesse: no, non puoi ancora avere i miei splendidi fiori e il dolce profumo dei loro petali. Se cercherai di coglierne uno, io ti ferir\u00f2! Vale la pena di rischiare le spine per prendere la rosa? Ma \u00e8 l\u00ec che sboccia il fiore: al di l\u00e0 del e spine, sta il premio. Cos\u00ec \u00e8 la vita. Le spine, i problemi dolorosi di sempre, ci aiutano a innalzarci sopra di essi e, cos\u00ec facendo, a imparare. Impariamo a esercitare la compassione, la gentilezza.. in caso contrario, le spine ci porteranno a compatirci, a piangere sulle nostre difficolt\u00e0, ed \u00e8 cos\u00ec che si piantano i semi dell'amarezza, dell'odio e della rovina."}, {"userName": "Beth", "userReviewDate": "Mar 17, 2009", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/612636-beth", "userReview": "I came across this book really randomly while browsing through our library\u2019s online catalog It looked promising: historical fiction with romance thrown in (or maybe a romance with history thrown in?). I thought I\u2019d try it out.I really did like the history told in this book. The \u201cmale lead\u201d (you can have that in a play; can you say \u201cmale lead\u201d for a book? You know what I mean), the new husband and soon-to-be father, is off at war and his plane is shot down. Unable to make contact with American troops, he joins the native guerrilla forces in the Phillippines. To read about this part of World War II history with which I was mostly unfamiliar was interesting and, actually, rather moving.I think, though, that the part I was supposed to find more moving was the whole love story between this man and his wife. The fact that she waits for him at the train station every Valentine\u2019s Day. The symbols of dreams and swallows on windowsills. The roses, the ones that bloom in their idyllic California garden and the crushed one the lieutenant keeps in his pocket. The fact that their love lives on and touches their now-grown son so that he might love again.There\u2019s a point where the present-day son\u2019s love interest hears the story and reacts with some incredulity \u2014 it\u2019s all so sentimentally mushy that it\u2019s hard to believe it\u2019s real (to which, I might add, that it isn\u2019t \u2014 this book is fiction). It\u2019s brushed aside by a little paragraph with some \u201cit doesn\u2019t matter if it\u2019s real; all that matters is the message\u201d theme. Yeah. I found all the romance rather overdone and hokey \u2014 but when the characters themselves think the story is a little on the hokey side, that\u2019s just over the top. (For some reason, though, I thought this might make a fine movie. Maybe I don\u2019t mind the sentimentality in a movie; who knows.)This story was good enough on its own without the constant flashbacks and without the romantic subplot of the reporter and the son.

This fictional love story surrounded by the semi-reality of World War II is the most beautiful story I was able to discover.

A love that I can\u2019t even fantom to exist in reality today. A love worth waiting 50 years for and a promise that makes you believe that true love isn\u2019t just a something we read in fairytales.

He is confused with the beauty he laid his eyes on and from that moment knew he could never leave his secret love again. On February 14, 1944 these two lovebirds wed but it wasn\u2019t long until Neil was called back into war leaving Caroline with their son alone.We venture into this story 65 years into the future of Caroline and Neil\u2019s love story, and we are introduced to Neil Thomas Jr. the son who has written about his parents love story in the local paper and Susan Allison a reporter who is trying to get more publicity out of this story. This isn\u2019t Susan\u2019s typical story and she is only trying to get by her boss by doing the bare miniumium but she soon realizes that once you start this love story you feel obligated to finish.This was an amazing novel that had a dual love working side by side. There is a film that was released in 2011 with Betty White playing Caroline and Jennifer Love Hewitt playing Susan and even though these actresses were in my opinion perfect for these roles the story line was different then the story.
