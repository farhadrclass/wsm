Horrible humans, horrible beasts and horrible politicians. I liked the back story on how the outbreak happens. Hopefully there are more stories about Eric to follow. Well worth a read if you love a good Zompoc."}, {"userName": "Robin", "userReviewDate": "Jan 25, 2015", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/38104143-robin", "userReview": "Jonathan Lynch sets his second novel, The Dust, in Dublin Ireland. People start dying soon after excavation begins on a new underground metro rail system in the city center. The narrator is a young mechanic named Eric Ward. Rats the size of cats are soon loose in the streets attacking people, followed shortly by the rising of the dead who turn into walking zombies. Eric struggles to save himself, his grandmother and his pregnant girlfriend Lauren. What happens next? It\u2019s a bonafide page-turner you won\u2019t want to put down until you find out. Lynch represents a fresh, young voice in the zombie genre. The Dust is well written and the main character is engaging. I quickly found myself rooting for him as he struggles against all the odds. If you liked World War Z, you\u2019ll thoroughly enjoy The Dust. I highly recommend it."}, {"userName": "Rachel Horon", "userReviewDate": "Jan 29, 2015", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/28781362-rachel-horon", "userReview": "Would you survive a zombie apocalypse?
