The PSA does not have anything to do with the book but a TOS policy change that Goodreads deemed not to tell their faithful users. \nThis book started out strongly. Despite the protagonist being a brat (the throwing hissy fits kind) I was very into the story. However, when it got to the middle and she completely forgot about the family she loved because \"ooooo cute boy\" and the plot seemed to focus purely on her crushing on said boy they lost me. And the overuse of the word \"foxy\" made me want to hit something. There was some SMASH BANG excitingness at the end but then it went into mopey melodramatic girl mode again.SPOILERS BEYOND THIS POINT (BRIEF SPOILERS & MINI RANT)Seriously I can't stand when girls are like \"Oh my relationships over I just want to die now.\" Nothing in books makes me ANGRIER. I've never called myself a feminist but this boy-centric female protagonist that is so common in paranormals makes me feel like one. It needs to stop! Girls should not lay down and hope to die just because a boy has left them. And it bothers me that women are the ones writing these weak female characters."}, {"userName": "Katerina", "userReviewDate": "Apr 01, 2015", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/5014021-katerina", "userReview": "Sooo, after finishing Switched I realized 2 things:1. I'm officially in love with Amanda Hocking2. Trolls are \nhot\n(3. I also suspect that I am a troll due to the hair thing, but I haven't found any proof yet. I'm looking on it.)\n\n\u201cDid you think you could treat me like shit at a dance, then sneak into my room in the middle of the night and tell me that I'm a troll with magical powers, and I'd just be like, yeah, that sounds right.\u201d \n\nWendy Everly, a girl whose mother tried to kill her when she was six and always thought that she was living someone else's life finds out that she is indeed living someone else's life, because she is a changeling, a child that is exchanged in secret for another child. Of course there is more, and she feels quite astonished when she is also told that she is a troll (although she isn't green), a royal one, the heir of the Trylle kingdom. So Wendy has to move into a palace with a cold mother when everyone prays for her downfall and another tribe wants to kidnap her for reasons unknown. And she has to fight her feelings for her sexy tracker/bodyguard, Finn.It is fun. It is so much fun. This series is the reason why all my friends call me troll-lover, but I'm not particularly concerned because if Finn was my lover, they would be concerned. And jealous. *cue evil laughter*I must admit I never thought I would want to be a troll or that a writer could make them such interesting and fascinating creatures, but Amanda did it! I loved the fast pace and the mythology and the twists in the story, Switched was an easy and entertaining read that made me forget stupid reality and stupid reality stuff!\n\n\u201cI look at you because I can't look away Wendy.That's kinda creepy.I will work on being less creepy then.\u201d \n\nI found Wendy irritating most of the times because she kept on acting before thinking and she was quite immature, but there were signs of development, plus her life was not an easy one, so I'm giving her the benefit of doubt. But I can't understand why everyone is keeping her in the darkness! Wouldn't everything be easier if they just told her what she needed to know in order to acclimate to her new life and try harder to rule someday? Just saying! I liked Finn, but I don't like the way the things between them are heading,even though I enjoyed the tension. Their love is not a healthy one. Tove is becoming one of my favorite characters, and so are Willa, Matt and Rhys! Elora, well, I'm not that fond of her but I bet there is an explanation for her behavior!To all paranormal fans all over the world, Trylle is an exciting world to dive in!!"}, {"userName": "shady boots | #20gayteen", "userReviewDate": "Aug 16, 2011", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/4972138-shady-boots-20gayteen", "userReview": "A more formal (and better xD) review of this is available on my blog.

She's also a princess.Every. Single. Character. In this book. Expected her to know everything about Trylle life already. Nobody even educates this girl. Sometimes Finn, the hero, tries to, but then they end up making out or some other annoying romantic activity.Wendy was so damn unlikable. She was close to being a TSTL heroine. When her mother, Elora, yelled at her about the stupidest things, she just stood there and took it. She needs to learn to stand up for herself. -_-I would've probably liked her, or at least respected her more, if she would just stop letting that bitchy mother of hers to treat her like fecal matter.I didn't like the characters, the story, the romance, nothing. But a friend of mine told me that it gets better in the sequel. I do see some potential in this series, I guess.I'd probably still read the sequel, just to see if it really gets better. I mean, I got a copy of it already. I bought it at the same time I got this one.

Self-published wonder turned multi-millionaire, now with multiple book deals. Before all of the hoopla, I read a little book called Switched. Even before all of the fame, I loved this book. So, of course, when it was re-released, I absolutely had to read it again. And let me tell you, I loved it even more this time around!Switched is extremely readable and entertaining. Both times I\u2019ve read it, I\u2019ve gotten pulled into the story immediately, and my eyes are glued to the pages until the book is done. The Trylle society is original and intricate, and I loved reading about the complexities of it, and how Wendy fits into all of it.Amanda Hocking has a smooth, exciting writing style. I\u2019ve never read something by her I haven\u2019t enjoyed immensely, even her blog posts! Her ability to create something so fun, yet thrilling in its own way is unique. I cannot wait to see where she goes in life, because I\u2019m sure that her recent surge in popularity is not temporary.Wendy is a strong-willed girl, and reading Switched from her perspective was a joy. She is in a tough position, but she doesn\u2019t budge when it comes to what she believes in, and I appreciate that. The other characters are completely enjoyable, and I loved them, and their interactions with each other.The Princess Diaries meets Tithe in Switched, the highly imaginative, immensely enjoyable novel from Amanda Hocking, an up-and-coming talent.

I know, right? Flashy colorful hair, so-ugly-they're-cute dolls we all had at one point? In Amanda's world, these are all misconceptions. They're called Trylle, and they're beautiful, magical and on the brink of extinction. With an entirely unique lore, Switched is able to stand out from all the other paranormal books available. I was fascinated by the Trylle mythology: How they lived, the monarchy, their custom of switching babies at birth. It was absolutely creative. Into this world comes a collection of commendable characters that are both well developed and easily likeable - even a select few that are fun to hate. Wendy has a big personality. She's had a difficult, traumatic childhood, but that only made her stronger for the wear. She doesn't let anyone manipulate her. She's sympathetic and kind. All of which make her really relatable. I enjoyed going through her dilemmas with her. The stressful demands of becoming a princess overnight, the boy she's falling for- it was all delightful. Almost like a modern day fairy tale. Yes! The wonderful boys! From sweet to sweaty, Wendy has got more than her pick of lovely bachelors to chose from. I absolutely loved how the romance was played out in Switched. It's passionate and heartbreaking. It doesn't fall with the clich\u00e9s of today's YA novels. It's unexpected - true to life. Truthfully, I devoured it and I can't fathom choosing a team. She can have them all, right?While there is still good story development, I did find some parts of the book were a bit slow. A good portion is dedicated to character and world building, however the book does not completely suffer from \"first book syndrome\" it does have its own beginning, middle and end, but I think the rest of the trilogy will be much more action packed with powerful plot twists.With this admirable debut, Amanda Hocking has begun a trilogy that has immense potential. Switched is just as beautiful inside as it is on the outside (definite cover lust) and I highly recommend it!--For more of my reviews, visit my blog at \nXpresso Reads"}, {"userName": "Pearl Angeli", "userReviewDate": "Jan 12, 2015", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/31514572-pearl-angeli", "userReview": "First off, Switched is really gorgeous. Just look at the cover. Isn't it so beautiful? I personally chose this edition because the cover has some work of magic in it. It's like, it has an ability to suck me into its world. Beautiful!Second, the premise is really, really good. I love fae stories, and trolls are something new to me. I wanted to know more about trolls because I really find them interesting. And of course, the fact that the female character Wendy Everly is a troll and a changeling, I knew I will really like this book.So, was this book a yay or nay?I must say, a little bit of both.I love it because honestly, Amanda Hocking's writing style is so flawless and very easy to read. She uses words that are light and undemanding. She doesn't complicate everything and she doesn't give me trouble analyzing such things. Her character and world-building is also non-complex. What you read is what you get. Now what made me become (a little) bit disappointed was the plot. It was neatly done, but it was weak. The progression was poorly established. I think there were scenes that weren't really necessary but they were given emphasis (I guess to lengthen the whole book) but to be honest, the interesting things only happened at the last few chapters of the book. Another thing that bothered me was the existence of the Vittras. These are the creatures that act as antagonists. They are Trylle's greatest enemies. In this book, their descriptions unfortunately didn't make an exceptional appeal. Their physicality was so vague. I couldn't really imagine how they look like. Do they look like human or something?My expectation for this book was also different. Because this book talks about trolls, I really expected to see some unworldly mythical creatures here. Creatures that look like these:Because we're talking about trolls, right? So why did I only see humans and no trolls at all? This is fantasy so I was looking for something different. Anyway, I understand it as I've read further, because the author eventually explained it through her characters that trolls don't really look mystical but instead, they look human. So yeah, I couldn't do anything about that. BUT STILL. I want to see REAL TROLLS. :-/Nevertheless, the thing that absolutely lifted the whole story was Finn. This character is so amazing. I like him from the beginning up to the end. Even though he's brooding and he was quite snobby in most parts of the book, the gentleness and protectiveness in him were so tangible. I have nothing against Wendy, on the other hand. She's an okay character and she doesn't annoy me, but I think she needs some development. There were parts when she doesn't know what to do and she's very dependent to other people despite her extraordinary abilities. Hopefully her character will get better in the next books.As a whole, this book is good. I just think it needs more elements to make it really sensational. My friends who have already read this series told me that it's going to get better in the next installments, so we'll see. Good luck to me!

There are plenty of suspenseful moments in this book which is why I kept reading bu there are also things lacking. One thing that got on my nerves was the lack of character building. I mean nearly all the characters felt like cardboard cutouts with no depth or personality. I found them hard to emphasise with. And another hing is I would have liked to know a bit more about the trolls themselves and what I is exactly that makes them more special than humans? I mean yeah they have magical powers that have been diluted over time and they \"commune with the earth\" don't like to wear shoes and sometimes have a greenish tinge but that's about all that's described oh and they leave their babies as changelings in rich families so that the rest of the trylle can have the money for medical care and a comfortable life when the channelling returns to the community.Another thing that bothered me was than Wendy HARDLY EVER stood up for herself when her mother treated her like shit and everyone else around her just expected her to know everything about trylle culture and forget about her home life. I was so frustrated at times I wanted to reach into the book and shake some sense into her. I just hope she becomes stronger in later books.I also would have liked to learn more about he vittra and why they are a violent sect of trolls and exactly what they want as this was unclear.

I've read and heard some much about Amanda Hocking lately - even an article on a major Italian newspaper - that I finally decided to give it a try. I'd like to start by saying that this is my second attempt at a self published author and the first one didn't go well. The other book I read was ALMOST HUMAN ~ The First Trilogy ~ 3-in-1 Edition and the main problem with it was the editing. The book was probably 150 pages longer than necessary and there was so much internal monologue that I skipped and skipped and skipped.With Switched the fundamental problem is basically the same: editing. This book is better than the one I mentioned above but it still needs a professional hand working through it. It certainly does not need to be cut. On the contrary. It jumped from action to action to action without any character development at all. Wendy goes from finding Finn creepy to falling in love with him without maturing the feeling inside her at all. BAM! I've fallen for him. The dialogue is horrific at times, there are long parts where the characters are just bickering and repeating things over and over.The second part of the book was definitely better than the first. The writing flowed better, even the dialogue got better and I almost never \"furrowed my brow\" like the characters so many times did. I was kind of shocked at the end when the escape scene is described in approximately 20 lines. It felt like Hocking was tired of writing or had finished her word count for the day and decided to cut it short. Plotwise once again I can't really say this book was anything new or original. I appreciated the Troll theme - that is new - but the rest is pretty much standard in YA lit now. Finn, especially, reminded me of a mix of Patch from Hush Hush (the stalking) and Sonny from Wondrous Strange. Wendy I didn't like AT ALL. What a pain in the ass she is. She kind of sounds like a badass at the beginning and then she turns in this whiny, please-Finn-save-me thing. Tove and Rhys I liked, especially Tove, an interesting character with a lot of potential. Matt is a totally underdeveloped character and i'm guessing we'll see more of him in the next installment.All in all, I can say this book was OK. Considering it is self published it is even good. But I also think that Hocking needs to mature as a writer, get published and acquire some new ideas. I will be looking for her work in a few years time."}, {"userName": "Megs \u2665", "userReviewDate": "Jul 19, 2011", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/5691412-megs", "userReview": "Ugghh! I like Amanda Hocking. I loved her series My Blood Approves, but this book was disappointing. Originally I tried to read this when it was first self published, and couldn't finish it. I got about halfway, put it down, thinking I have way too many better things to be reading right now than this troll book. It wasn't even like I hated it, I just got incredibly bored and got to a point where realized I didn't care about Wendy or what happens to her. So we know that recently it was republished and a lot of my friends have rated this book in the 4-5 star range so I began to wonder if I was missing something. I was also prompted to try the repubbed version because it was supposedly polished up a bit, and so I gave it another try. Well, that was stupid. I should have just trusted my instincts and known that just because so many other people enjoyed this book didn't mean I would magically change my mind about it. Also, I'm really happy for Amanda and all of her success so I just really wanted to like this series.I'm not going to go into too much detail about the things I liked or didn't like, because there are a large amount of points already made for both, but as a simple short list the things I didn't like were: Wendy, Wendy's Mom, the dialog What I liked was: Flynn, the originality of the story and the changeling aspect. The world was creative, but the story and characters didn't offer much. The synopsis really made this book seem interesting, too. Oh well.To those who love this series I would like to know why.

I had heard that the books were riddled with typos, so on and etc. But I made the argument to myself that most people do. \"It's only $0.99.\"What I liked... 1. good pacing. The books have a zip-zip pace to them, and I think that's what draws a lot of people in. 2. There is a sense of playfulness. What I didn't like. 1. Trolls... treillings, whatever you call them. Just, really? I just couldn't get beyond the image in my head from a Merlin episode where a troll posing as a queen seduces Uther and spends most of the episode eating rotten produce. Just ew. And there wasn't really an effort made (besides the snooty name change offered by the troll-mom) to adjust the reader.2. The typos. But meh, not the end of the world.3. The total inconsistency of the plot. The human brother is real the heroine. And the mom trying to kill the troll daughter... um, in a different story it would be completely justifiable and she would be the protagonist. Like, you have to suspend a great deal of brain power to be like \"okay, losing your son wouldn't make you crazy...\" because I think it would.4. The reason for the switching... is disgusting. For money? Really? REALLY? That's the only reason. At the cost of a human child being separated from their family... I couldn't get over that. Finally, a lot of this would be justifiable if the writing was more complex or had just \"a bit more.\" But I think these books are representative of works too quickly written. Sigh, I wanted to like these more, but I can't recommend that anyone else read them when compared to the whole slew of books on the market that are bettered edited and written with more care.

Instead:Wendy has spent her entire life feeling as if she does not belong.

Michael Jackson died and Obama was elected US president.This is also when Twilight became super popular and there was this surge of Paranormal YA. This was initially published in 2010 on the heels of this, and out of that wave of paranormal books this does stand out. It is fairly original, has a fun premise and moves quickly. If I\u2019d read this back then, I probably would have enjoyed it. But looking at it now, it\u2019s just a string of paranormal clich\u00e9sPros:Like I said, this is fairly original in some aspects. The overall ideas about trolls (or Trylle, as Wendy\u2019s \u2018tribe\u2019 is called) and changelings are very well thought out and creative. The pacing in this was great! It moved very quickly without being confusing and it was very much a short, action-infused read.Yay for MC calling love-interest out when his staring is creepy.

This is not okay. I understand Wendy\u2019s relationship with her \u2018mother\u2019 is complicated, but she kept flip-flopping. One paragraph she would call her a \u201cgood mother\u201d and the next say she was a horrible woman who only ever attempted to murder her.

Without knowing a thing about the book other than the brief synopsis I read before I downloaded the story, and the overwhelming number of positive reviews, I figured it would be an awesome quick read.\u2018Switched\u2019 is about Wendy Everly, a girl who lives with her aunt and brother in an attempt to control the chaos of her life. Her mother, Kim, tried to kill her on her 6th birthday, and since then her life has been a downward spiral of changing homes and failed friendships. Within this backdrop we discover that Wendy has some peculiar abilities, and is given an opportunity by a mysterious boy, Finn, to move once again to a new place where she can finally fit in. However, if she decides to make the move she will have to leave behind her brother and aunt, the only two people who have ever cared about her.I\u2019ve only revealed the first 20 pages or so and it sounds like a decent story line right? However, once the story begins to progress you discover that it doesn\u2019t go anywhere. The plot never advances, the characters are underdeveloped, the conversation is so far away from colloquial it seems as if the \u2018speaker\u2019 is rummaging through a thesaurus before deciding on each word choice, and the romantic elements in the story make you cringe with the overwhelming amount of cheesiness. I suppose if you\u2019re into the new \u2018supernatural teen romance\u2019 genre that is emerging, this book could be for you.

YA novels are indeed a guilty pleasure for me and this series was great. I often wondered how much better the books would be with a strong editor, but they were definitely worth reading as is.

I loved this book I couldn't put it down! Something new and of course cheesy romance but clean. Well you hear all the time about changeling stories but about the human that is taken not the other way around! This time it's actually about the changeling itself, which was nice and was brought back to the world that they are actually from. It was a new story for me! I liked it a lot! I really like Wendy the main character. Her narration is really strong and I could just picture her so clearly. She's a genuinely nice, level headed person despite the fact that her mother tried to kill her when she was six and everybody keeps their distance from her. The storyline with her mother was so creepy and fascinating! Finn (another character you'll love) tells Wendy she is a changling and everything goes nuts after that! It was obviously a shock for Wendy and the reader to find out that her mother wasn't crazy at all- she was telling the truth when she said Wendy had been switched at birth. But it's creepy for a \"motherly figure\" in ANY book to try to kill a character which makes it creepy.So this Finn character is supposed to be her guide in the matter of her being switched and has come to \"collect\" Wendy and bring her back. However, it did seem that she missed out on many of the undercurrents of silent communication that ran from Trylle to Trylle, and definitely that of Elora, the queen. This could be attributed to her recent arrival, and her more important place in the Trylle hierarchy, especially since Wendy is not part of the Fey but is in fact a Troll! Now these trolls are elegant and beautiful and have awesome powers. Finn explains that he\u2019s a tracker, someone who goes out into the world and brings back the changlings; changlings in these books are the troll children who are switched out for other children. Intrigued? good! It was overall a fun cute book! so check it out! tell me what you think!

I'll have to write a\u00a0separate\u00a0post about the changing nature of the biz, it's relationship to other publishing\u00a0businesses\u00a0(like video games), and the rise of the self published ebook author. But in\u00a0any case, I stumbled upon this\u00a0independent and self published author who is selling very well (mostly on Amazon) with no prior print history. I figured I'd check one out. Switched appears to be her best seller and she says on her blog that it's her favorite.This is a funny little paranormal romance about a girl whose mother hates her and thinks she's a changeling -- but she is. In fact she's a troll. She's then dragged off to her real mother. The first 25% is slightly \"high school novel,\" and the later 75% \"fish out of water.\"Overall, I'm not sure what to make of the book. The first person voice was strangely engaging and I pounded through it easy in an afternoon. Still, it felt like a first (or maybe second draft), and it's full of flaws.According to her website the author has roughly ten novels, mostly written in 2010 and she pounds out the first drafts 2-4 weeks! I consider myself fast at 2,500-4,000 words a day of first draft, but I have to admire that kind of lightning pace. The book was short. Maybe 50-60k words and it could perhaps be classified as \"engaging\" but could've been \"really fun read\" with some real editing.There is a crazy amount of \"tell,\" in this book. A lot of it buried in the overzealous volume of interior monologue. Characters are constantly attributed characteristics directly, without them being shown. Often, these characteristics are never shown. The protagonist gives the straight dope on things as she sees it, but this often feels more like how the author wants the reader to see it than how it really is. In fact, there isn't a whole lot of \"show\" in the book at all.The author is a solid writer. The sentences themselves are well formed, but a lot of them needed to come out, or be trimmed down. Conversations are redundant. Dialog points are redundant. The author loves the words creepy and foxy. Really loves creepy. The important scenes feel drained of emotion as the excessive interior monologue and somewhat forced dialog rob the moments of any real drama. The more casual conversations feel better than the important ones. When there's action it's awkwardly blocked, so that you have to go back and reread lines sometimes to figure out what happened physically. The overall plot is pretty straightforward. The end was abrupt and unsatisfying too.But still.\u00a0I can't say it didn't have a certain charm. I enjoyed reading it, more than many published POCs (like for instance Personal Demons). The fantasy concept is decent and didn't bug me.Of course the novel only cost 99 cents! The writing is probably on par with Twilight\u00a0(see my review HERE). Not that that's high praise. It just needs a lot of revision. Some plot changes to increase drama, character\u00a0tune-ups, and most of all line editing (see my detailed post on that HERE).This is an Indy book. It's professional, but it's also the novel\u00a0equivalent\u00a0of a B movie. Written quickly, revised quickly, and sold cheaply. The author has enough talent to shoot higher."}, {"userName": "Mary", "userReviewDate": "Mar 29, 2012", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/4127670-mary", "userReview": "Me trying to rate book:Scans options.

It isn't until eleven years later that Wendy finds out her mother might've been telling the truth. With the help of Finn Holmes, Wendy finds herself in a world she never knew existed - and it's one she's not sure if she wants to be a part of.What I Liked:I featured Frostfire, Hocking's upcoming novel, on my blog a few weeks ago. I'm pretty excited about that one in particular. So when I went to request the book, the team at St. Martin's Press told me that I should probably read the Trylle series first, since Frostfire is book one of a spinoff series. And then these wonderful people offered me review copies of the Trylle series. Nice, right? I remember when this series was self-published. I remember feeling meh about the series, but wanting to give it a shot, because trolls are pretty rare in YA literature. And now I have my chance!Wendy is a changeling - she was switched at birth with a human baby, and was placed in a human family. The human baby was placed in the keeping of the Trylle (a troll tribe). Wendy had no idea of any of this, not until the Vittra (another troll tribe) attacked her. With the help of Finn, a Trylle tracker, Wendy arrives at the home of the Trylle - and her real mother, the Queen of the Trylle. Wendy has a lot to learn if she is to be Princes...Obviously I'm in the middle, with this book. But my outlook on this book is positive, overall. Hocking put together a very interesting and intriguing story. There was no point in the story where I was like, ugh, this is boring. The story is slow, taking place mostly in the Trylle Queen's palace, in which Wendy must learn everything about the Trylle and being a princess. Slow, but necessary.I can't decide if I like Wendy or not - but honestly, I was rooting for her in this book. I hated how she felt in the beginning of the book - different, unique, unhappy. She never fit in anywhere. But then, even with the Trylle, she doesn't fit in, since she is the Princess. I hated how her mother pushed her around, trying to mold her into the perfect Princess. It's not like Wendy ever asked for any of that. It's not like she's ungrateful - she just doesn't want that life. I really felt for her. I'm not saying we'd be best friends (in my opinion, she's a bit of an airhead sometimes), but I understand her. The trolls thing is cool. The reason why humans and trolls are switched at birth is because trolls loveeee riches, so they put their troll babies in very rich families, so then the troll baby will grow up with a trust fund. Some trolls have extraordinary powers - for example, Wendy has some serious persuasion skills. The romance is... weird. I've already heard things about a messy romance in this series as a whole, so I'm prepared for the \"worst\". I don't need to love this series - heck, I never planned on reading it - so I'm not worried about being super invested in the series.Overall, I'm definitely excited to read the next book. The short story at the end of this book was interesting - I hope to see more of Loki in the future. I think I know where Hocking is going with that particular situation...What I Did Not Like:Sometimes, Wendy bothered me a lot. She's an airhead at times, gaping at hot boys like they are the only boys on the planet. I mean, it's so air headed to just flat-out gawk, right? And her decision-making skills aren't always the finest. I wanted to see more of a brave Wendy, a risk-taker, the girl with the temper. It keeps getting mentioned that she has a temper, but other than the very beginning (the prologue), I didn't really see that. So, more character development from Wendy. Also, more story development? We get a taste of the bigger picture at the very end of this one, with the Vittra, so that's a good sign.I'm confused about the romance. I know for sure that Wendy has lusty feelings for Finn (and vice versa), but is Tove a part of a potential love triangle? And Rhys - making it some sort of love pyramid? Hopefully not. Would I Recommend It:Ehh, this series has been out for a while. If you were around back when it was self-published (and super cheap), then you've probably heard a lot about it. I'm keeping an open mind, and I'm reading the next two books regardless. I'm liking the series so far, but apparently the next ones are the rough ones... so we'll see!Rating:3.5 stars -> rounded down to 3 stars. Only because I don't think I loved enough to consider it a four-star-read.

The story had me so engaged, that I could not put it down. I was reading in the car, at school, on my bed, at the dinner table, and in the media room. You could call it an obsession.In this paranormal tale, Wendy learns at the age of seventeen that she is a troll. Oh, but she isn\u2019t just ANY troll, her past is filled with mystery, deceit, and some unexpected ancestors. Amanda Hocking carefully twisted this plot with all sorts of surprises. I guarantee that you have not read a series quite like this before.Plain and simple \u2013 Wendy rocks! She starts out unsure and confused. I mean, who wouldn\u2019t be questioning things if they just found out they were a troll. The beauty lies in how Wendy grows and changes. As her confidence grows, she becomes the girl (err troll) she was always meant to be.Let\u2019s talk romance. Wendy has more boy trolls after her than she keep track of. They are all nice in their own way, but they each have their unique traits. Finn is protective. Loki is a flirt. Tove is like a brother. I loved them all.If you are looking for a battle, you have come to the right place. Amanda Hocking has written some of the most epic battle scenes ever. Sure these scenes are filled with the physical battle, but they also contain the emotions behind the fight. They were so real that I could FEEL them.This series about trolls surprised and entertained me. I will definitely be looking for more Amanda Hocking books to read.RATING5 LovedCOVER COMMENTSI like how the covers are so similar and work together to tell the story.

I know this is a \"young adult\" book, but since when did young people not deserve good writing? I actually generally enjoy this genre, but I was extremely disappointed with this one. The plot is tired; how I long for something other than the normal-kid-finds-out-s/he's-secretly (or secretly in love with)-a-[name a mythical creature] theme. The plot was literally so predictable that I might have been able to announce a character's fate from the moment of his/her introduction--the first descriptions of a character basically gave away where the plot was going. So painful.But even a relatively mundane plot can find redemption in good execution, i.e., good writing and interesting/novel ideas. This had neither. The writing plods along at about an early high school level...and I don't mean it sounds like it was written *for* an early high-schooler--it sounds like it was written *by* one, complete with painful grammatical/style errors that will make anyone who loves the English language cringe.I actually had high hopes for these books, since I like generally to have one light-reading series in the queue at all times (Twilight, Harry Potter, Golden Compass, Hunger Games were all decent reads over the last few years).

Oh but Emily, why didn't you just DNF it? Because it was a gift is why, and conscience is a bitch. The writing was unbearably immature, but I could have overlooked that, I could have, if the characters just hadn't been so...  uggh!! Amanda Hocking failed so miserably at trying to make likable MC's. Wendy runs away from her brother and aunt  who she loves so much  and then she spends the rest of the book not giving a single damn about them. Not to mention the amount of insta-love was so tragic I felt like eating four liters of Ben&Jerrys. Declarations of love started already at page 48, and that's just sad. No really, it's  sad. And these \"Trylle's\" that we are supposed to root for are so disgusting and selfish that innocent unicorns all over the world are crying tears of shame after having read this book. It should be - actually it IS - a crime to be as selfish as they are. They **SPOILER** switch innocent little human babies for their own, so that their troll kid can grow up in a rich family, and then when they're old enough can take all the money of that family and run away with it back to the trolls. And what happens to the kidnapped human babies, you ask? They get treated like dog crap the rest of their lives. Oh joy, sounds so wonderful, right?I feel like I'm guilty of some horrible crime after having read this, like I should have stopped all this madness. How am I supposed to root for these things, for these creatures? The only three characters I actually liked (Rhys, Tove and Willa) were constantly seen as unworthy of the \"awesomeness\" that is Trylle, and the fact that the higher Trylle's couldn't even hug the lesser Trylle's because they were \"parasites\"... I do realize that the world isn't fair, but these are the people that are supposed to be the  good ones, the heroes, and that's just awful. This book is such a waste of paper!
