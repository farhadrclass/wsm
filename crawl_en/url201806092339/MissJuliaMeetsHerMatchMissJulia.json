Ross in this popular series. While this is not high literature, I thoroughly enjoy the situations that Miss Julia finds herself in. She is like a madcap Angela Lansbury careening through her small southern town trying to please everyone while dealing with her many personal crazy friends and relations. These are hilarious and often you can't put them down. I don't know why they never made this into a comedy series."}, {"userName": "Laurel", "userReviewDate": "Jan 20, 2016", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/1545101-laurel", "userReview": "Miss Julia books always make me laugh out loud at least once!

The religion and small town gossip thread got to me after a while. I lived in the South and I live in a small town, so I understand how important/detrimental it can be, but it's not a lot to build a whole book on. The previous one Miss Julia Hits the Road and number one were much more fun. Still, this did have one of the best lines ever to end the book with.

This was another Miss Julia book. The title character is a wealthy southern woman \"of a certain age\" with definite opinions about her the others in her narrow-minded small southern town. She comes across as very naive. All the characters in the series are very colorful. These books are a great comic relief and a lot of fun for me."}, {"userName": "Dorothy Timm", "userReviewDate": "Jul 04, 2014", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/750142-dorothy-timm", "userReview": "I gave this book only two stars not because it was bad, it wasn't that bad, but it just wasn't at all what I expected.

This book has her considering the marriage proposal of her long time friend but short time beau, Sam. He wants to change Miss Julia's widow status to new bride. Though Sam is a much better man than her late husband, Miss Julia has her doubts.To prove her independence she makes a hasty and it turns out bad business deal that weaves throughout the book. She gets word that the aforementioned late husband may have been more of a philanderer than she first suspected. Miss Julia wants to keep it quiet not to protect her reputation but the feelings of her husband's illegitimate son that she has come to love.In the meantime, a local comes home and Miss Julia decides to welcome her who used to be a him back to town with a reception. It's not charity so much as curiosity and a chance to deflect the talk about her late husband.The book was written more than 10 years ago so it's interesting to see how far attitudes have come and yet not come while reading this. I could have done without Lillian's granddaughter, but I continue to be a fan of Lillian and Sam who both have Miss Julia's back."}, {"userName": "Kristen", "userReviewDate": "Jul 15, 2008", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/941605-kristen", "userReview": "A truly irascible southern woman! I like the Miss Julia series of books for the humor and audacity of the main character, Miss Julia Springer. She goes to great lengths to solve everyone's problems while maintaining her desire not to be involved. In this book, Miss Julia's beau, Sam, is not to be put off when it comes to marriage, slanderous gossip abounds about the preacher's wife when she begins to wear make-up and flirt with a wealthy out of towner, and someone has spotted the preacher's secretary at an out of the way motel with the mayor. All this and a company of religious fanatics who want to build a Walk Where Jesus Walked Theme Park on Miss Julia's land, and a good friend's son returns to town sporting a new look--as a woman. Miss Julia is kept busy trying to straighten things out in her usual no nonsense meddling."}, {"userName": "Chris Inman", "userReviewDate": "Apr 02, 2013", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/8300391-chris-inman", "userReview": "Miss Julia is a character I have really come to love and cherish. She is set in her ways, somewhat cranky, yet her many adventures are a delight to read. Miss Julia has lived her life a certain way defined by what her church and husband strong-armed her into for over forty years, so it is perfectly understandable that she would be hesitant before pursing a relationship with Sam. I think this book (so far) has been my favorite book in the Miss Julia series. Not only for her agonizing about a marriage with Sam but Ms. Ross' depiction of how often (more times than not) there is corruption within religious groups, from the crooked religious amusement park to the fornication between her pastor's secretary and a financial banker of the amusement park."}, {"userName": "Allyson Daniels", "userReviewDate": "Oct 27, 2016", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/28098347-allyson-daniels", "userReview": "I didn't particularly like this book. The Hippocracy of the main character drive me nuts. She seemed to flip flop between chapters between not caring at all what anyone else thought and caring so much that she was willing to throw everyone else under the bus to get herself to look better. In the end it just got kind of old, I kept wanting something more to happen in the plot. I also felt like the author threw all the controversial things she could think of for the town to deal with in one book just for fun. Sometimes the storyline want very clear because she was introducing a new gossip chain so soon."}, {"userName": "Laura Gilfillan", "userReviewDate": "Feb 06, 2014", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/5070433-laura-gilfillan", "userReview": "In this one, Julia sells a parcel of land to be developed as a Walk Where Jesus Walked theme park, and then regrets it. More scandal about her late husband arises, which she tries to protect Hazel Marie, and Lloyd from, and meanwhile, gossip flies around the town, and nearly everyone is involved in some of it. Her close friend's son comes back to town as a daughter, and the pastor's wife explores a bit of fashion, much to his dismay. It's sort of a lot of ado about nothing, but quite amusing. And of course the title implies that there will be some progress in Julia and Sam's courtship. I enjoyed this story as much as the others in this series."}], "description": "With devoted fans across the country, Miss Julia, that endearingly sharp-tongued southern belle of a certain age, has no shortage of admirers. But in Miss Julia Meets Her Match, our feisty heroine must come to terms with her most ardent admirer of all: longtime beau Sam Murdoch, who wants to tie the knot. While it\u2019s hard to resist Sam\u2019s charm, Miss Julia isn't about to give up her independence so easily. After all, there are plenty of other matters that require her attention, including a Holy Land theme park to be built on her property, a possible affair between the mayor and the preacher\u2019s secretary, and the arrival of her housekeeper Lillian\u2019s five-year-old pistol of a great-granddaughter.
