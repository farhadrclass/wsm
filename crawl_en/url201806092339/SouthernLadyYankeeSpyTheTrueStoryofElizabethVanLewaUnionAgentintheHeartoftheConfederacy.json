A book that does Ms. Van Lew justice. The only other stand alone book about her was called something like \"Crazy Bet's Diary\" and while it did just reprint her diary, and it provided some insight to who she was, it also added bits that made her appear just as a loon a lot of the time. This biography, however, is well thought out and written. One of the most famous people of the Civil War (or should be) is done justice in this thorough account of her life."}, {"userName": "Ebookwormy1", "userReviewDate": "Oct 03, 2008", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/1005834-ebookwormy1", "userReview": "An excellent addition to Civil War reading, Elizabeth Varon has not only documented the life of Elizabeth Van Lew, she has given us deep insight into the cultural drivers of the civil war, Richmond's experience of the war, the repression of Unionism in the South, the challenges of reconstruction, and the root of the willful embrace of the \"glory of Confederacy.\"Van Lew's heartwrenching moral dilemma - loving her country (which she always believed to be the Union of States), her state of Virginia (which she saw as central in the founding of the country), her city (where she was born and lived her entire life), and (most precious of all) her past and present family - is illustrated from her childhood through her death and beyond into her legacy. Van Lew was convinced she had to do everything in her power to contribute to the Union war effort, establish the equality of all people (black & white), and pray for the war's end. This commitment endangered all her family held dear: the family itself, reputation, fortune, and fellowship with others. Van Lew's willingness to sacrifice for her convictions and her optimism that she would see and experience the change she worked for are inspiring, even though Van Lew is denied the full realization of her dreams in the post-war period.Van Lew is still a controversial figure today, particularly in her beloved Richmond, both honored by Unionists and scorned by those who have bound their hearts to the Confederacy today. In order to determine whether you believe Elizabeth Van Lew was a traitor or a hero, you will have to read this book for yourself! Highly recommended.For a historical fiction treatment of similiar themes, seeCandle in the Darkness, Austin, 2002https://www.goodreads.com/review/show...With Lee in Virginia, Henty, 1890https://www.goodreads.com/review/show..."}, {"userName": "Beth Cato", "userReviewDate": "Aug 31, 2014", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/8706020-beth-cato", "userReview": "A friend recommended this book to me a while back, and I'm so glad he did. It's an in-depth look at the life of Union spy Elizabeth Van Lew, but more than that, it provides insight to Richmond during the Civil War and what happened there during Reconstruction. Elizabeth not only funneled military data to the north, but she also worked hard for equality for blacks and women. For all three of these reasons, she was treated as a pariah in her beloved Richmond. Her enemies hounded her. The press despised her. People walked around her on the street. She became paranoid and friendless-a neighborhood witch. Varon observes that after Elizabeth's death, people remembered her that way and then declared she had always behaved in such a way--effectively rewriting her role in history as a madwoman.Varon provides extensive foot notes and relies greatly on material of the period, especially Elizabeth's own journals and period newspapers. I haven't read a great deal about Reconstruction, and certainly not how it was in the Confederate capital of Richmond. The subject matter was fascinating and yet frustrating because of the cruelty of people and how Elizabeth's work was denigrated for so long. This is definitely a book I will keep on my shelf for future reference, and one I highly recommend for anyone interested in a different perspective on the Civil War and its aftermath."}, {"userName": "Stephanie", "userReviewDate": "Mar 20, 2014", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/2140365-stephanie", "userReview": "This book was VERY well researched and written with extreme detail. That is what made it difficult for me to get through. There is no doubt Ms. Varon took great care in bringing this book to life. The first half was more about the war than Elizabeth Van Lew.

But with stories about secret codes and invisible ink, the nighttime exhumation of the body of a fallen Union officer, a daring underground prison escape and all manner of subterfuge and daring, much of the book reads like an espionage novel.How did Van Lew get away with so much right before the eyes of the opposition? Varon cites the prevailing deferential view of the \"southern lady\" as incapable of such actions as one factor. And she uses primary source documents to argue that Van Lew was undaunted and determined, yet extremely cautious and shrewd in carrying out her operation, debunking the post Reconstruction mythology in which she came to be known as \"Crazy Bet.\"Solid history and a most enjoyable read."}, {"userName": "Hedy", "userReviewDate": "Jan 30, 2018", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/5788037-hedy", "userReview": "This was a story that needed to be told. Ms. Van Lew seems to have been an amazing women. An accomplished spy for the north in the face of her own southern brethren, as well as a female during the time that females were indeed second class citizens not allowed to vote. Clearly I have a bias such that I believe that the civil war was about slavery and not about states rights, so I enjoyed knowing that Ms. Van Lew did her part from the very place where I live to support the cause. This was a well researched and written account of Ms. Van Lew and her successes and the obstacles she faced in her lifetime."}, {"userName": "Melissa Symons", "userReviewDate": "Feb 19, 2018", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/63432066-melissa-symons", "userReview": "This book was interesting and historical but read a lot like a history textbook, which made it difficult for me to finish (it took me over 4 years to complete).

The Civil War was a time when some women began to deny male leadership and social pressures and began to develop their own political opinions. Women, for the first time were held accountable for their actions and were not excused due to gender or social class. Van Lew ministered to Union prisoners in Richmond jails, hid escaped prisoners in her home and led her own spy ring. She used invisible ink and code to send messages of troop movement, local attitudes and possible strategies to several Union Generals including Grant. She may have been able to plant a former slave who could read in Jefferson Davis's home. Her family's net worth was considered to be $37,000 in 1861. At the end of the war their net worth was $15,000. Van Lew spent money on bribes, food, and clothing for Union prisoners. After the war she was appointed postmaster of Richmond by President Grant and had to suffer derision due to her gender and her having been a Union supporter. Richmond males who had served in the Confederate Army believed themselves much better suited for the job. She improved mail service in Richmond and for the first time hired mail carriers to deliver to homes. Yet she was the object of unfounded gossip and cruel taunts because she hired blacks. The Van Lew family freed their slaves before the war."}, {"userName": "Cecilia", "userReviewDate": "Jan 21, 2016", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/51806236-cecilia", "userReview": "I read this book to get a better perspective on Elizabeth Van Lew and the people and circumstances that surrounded her life. The book is based on historical documents and recollections of decedents. Hers is a story of incredible strength, intelligence, love, and dedication to the idea that the United States should remain united.Some of the events and thinking of Lizzie are, by necessity, assumptions made by the author but I think that if the book is a fair and unbiased account of her life and activities on behalf of preservation of the Union, she was amazing. I would love to have met her and had a conversation about slavery, in particular.Spoiler alert, she ended her days sadly and isolated by her Virginia \"friends\" and neighbors for the most part. That circumstance is indicative of the depth and breadth of hatred and bigotry still found today, not only in the Southern US, but globally. I guess the book reinforces the old adage - and I'm paraphrasing here - \"if we don't learn from history, we are doomed to repeat it over and over again. Which brings to mind another oldie - the definition of crazy is to make the same mistake over and over again leading to failure over and over again - but expecting a different result.A very interesting and though provoking book. I gave it 5 stars which I almost never do."}, {"userName": "Kristi Thielen", "userReviewDate": "May 25, 2015", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/5422600-kristi-thielen", "userReview": "Engrossing book to read at any time, but especially in the week in which the appropriate use of the Confererate flag as a cultural icon is part of the national dialogue. I was aware that being a Union supporter in the south during the Civil War was difficult; I had not realized how very dangerous it was or that there was such a complex network of Union supporters, including Van Lew, who actively worked to aid the north. And the fact that southern states dragooned young, poor men to fill the Confederate ranks is certainly something that pop cultural classics like \"Gone With the Wind,\" skirted. Apparently Scarlett's suitors - glamorous young planter sons - weren't quite as anxious to fight the Yankees as Margaret Mitchell would have us believe.Even more compelling than her wartime experiences are the traumas Van Lew suffered in post-war years. She battled ostracism and professional setback, as she watched fellow southerners wrap themselves in the myth of the Lost Cause and the federal government, weary of the burden of Reconstruction, allowed them to do so. What would Van Lew think of the south if she could see it today?"}, {"userName": "Kristen", "userReviewDate": "Aug 04, 2014", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/11382577-kristen", "userReview": "I got this book because I read the fictionalized account of the life of Elizabeth Van Lew in the book The Spymistress. I loved that book so much that after I finished it, I wanted to know how much of the fictional account was accurate. Since the author of the novel cited this book as one of her primary sources, I decided to read this non-fiction account. It was okay.I found this very dense and challenging to read. Some non-fiction can be terrific, and very entertaining to read. This book wasn't like that. It read very much like a text-book, which, I suppose is fair, given that it is, in effect a history text-book sort of book. I can't say I really enjoyed this, although it did validate that much of what's in the novel is very close to the reality of Van Lew's life. If you are interested in Elizabeth Van Lew's spying activities on behalf of the Union during the Civil War, and you want to be entertained while you learn, I recommend the novel. I enjoyed it more, and it gives you most of what really happened in a more entertaining style."}, {"userName": "Lisa Potocar", "userReviewDate": "Oct 27, 2012", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/9951194-lisa-potocar", "userReview": "A thoroughly researched and enjoyable read about Elizabeth Van Lew, a member of the elite of Richmond, Virginia, where she was born, raised, and lived all of her life. She strongly opposed slavery and favored the preservation of the Union. As such, she organized an incredible underground network that, right under the noses of the Confederacy, labored to help Yankee prisoners to escape and provide intelligence to the United States' government that at times helped to thwart the Rebels.

In Southern Lady, Yankee Spy, historian Elizabeth Varon provides a gripping, richly researched account of the woman who led what one historian called \"the most productive espionage operation of the Civil War.\" Under the nose of the Confederate government, Van Lew ran a spy ring that gathered intelligence, hampered the Southern war effort, and helped scores of Union soldiers to escape from Richmond prisons.Varon describes a woman who was very much a product of her time and place, yet continually took controversial stands\u2014from her early efforts to free her family's slaves, to her daring wartime activities and beyond. Varon's powerful biography brings Van Lew to life, showing how she used the stereotypes of the day to confound Confederate authorities (who suspected her, but could not believe a proper Southern lady could be a spy), even as she brought together Union sympathizers at all levels of society, from slaves to slaveholders. After the war, a grateful President Ulysses S. Grant named her postmaster of Richmond\u2014a remarkable break with custom for this politically influential post. But her Unionism, Republican politics, and outspoken support of racial justice earned her a lifetime of scorn in the former Confederate capital. Even today, Elizabeth Van Lew remains a controversial figure in her beloved Richmond, remembered as the \"Crazy Bet\" of Lost Cause propaganda. Elizabeth Varon's account rescues her from both derision and oblivion, depicting an intelligent, resourceful, highly principled woman who remained, as she saw it, true to her country to the end.", "title": "Southern Lady, Yankee Spy: The True Story of Elizabeth Van Lew, a Union Agent in the Heart of the Confederacy", "url": "http://www.goodreads.com/book/show/119244.Southern_Lady_Yankee_Spy", "average": 3.84, "cover": "https://images.gr-assets.com/books/1349088656l/119244.jpg", "reviews": 22, "authors": [{"url": "https://www.goodreads.com/author/show/69125.Elizabeth_R_Varon", "name": "Elizabeth R.
