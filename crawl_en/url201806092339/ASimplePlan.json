The pilot is dead but he has a duffel bag with 4.4 million dollars in it. The three men agree to sit on the money until they're sure no one is looking for it. But can they keep their mouthes shut? And what will happen when someone talks?A Simple Plan is the story of three men in a difficult situation that quickly escalates into violence. The underlying theme seems to be how one lie inevitably leads to one more.The main characters are fairly complex. Hank wants to protect his brother but also wants the money. Jacob wants to buy back his parents' farm with the money but he also wants to please his brother. Lloyd needs the money to pay back some gambling debts and can't wait six months. See where this is going? Once things start going off the rails, they continue going off the rails for the rest of the book. The first murder is just the tip of the bloody iceberg. How much killing does it take to cover up one murder? Quite a few, it turns out.Scott Smith's writing packs quite a punch. It's a cut above most thrillers and really makes me wish he wrote more than just this and The Ruins. Much like the Ruins, I wasn't sure how any of the characters would live much longer at the 50% mark.The series of revelations near the end spell out the book's message: Crime doesn't pay. If I ever find a bag of money in the woods and I have people with me, we're turning it in to the cops. Alone, I could probably handle it...Four out of five stars.

Sarah\u2019s idea of returning some money to the plane is clever, but returning to it causes the first murder. Killing Sonny as part of the stage setting for the murders of Lou and Nancy was completely unnecessary. The cops would have no trouble believing that a guy like Lou could shotgun his girlfriend in a drunken rage for any trivial reason. Trying to make it look like Sonny and Nancy were having an affair was an unnecessary risk that could have easily backfired.\u2022 Speaking of that shotgun murder spree, I\u2019ve read this three or four times, but I just realized that Smith made some critical errors with Hank's actions that should have got him caught. First, Hank called Sarah after Lou and Nancy were dead, and she comes up with the plan about involving Sonny. The story is that they dropped off Lou and were leaving when they heard the shooting. If the cops pulled the phone records (Which seems likely at the house of a quadruple murder.) they\u2019d see that call to Sarah and have a good idea that Hank was lying. Also, gunshot residue tests that would be routinely administered in a situation like that would show that Lou hadn\u2019t fired a gun but that Hank had been emptying a shotgun. \u2022 I\u2019d forgotten the part about Jacob\u2019s dog. Hank really shows that he\u2019s kind of an uncaring son-of-a-bitch under this regular fella persona when he leaves the poor animal alone in a garage nights and ties it to a tree during the day where it has nothing to do but sit in the cold and mud. He never considers that it\u2019s not Jacob\u2019s death but his own treatment that makes the dog mean, or of trying to find another home for it. The way he botched the shooting of it is also the most painful scene in the book for me. Yeah, I\u2019m one of those people who can read about or watch a thousand people getting brutally murdered without batting an eye, but even fictional cruelty to animals makes me sick.

If characters always made the right decisions or the smartest ones, there would be absolutely no drama and why the hell would anyone want to read about people who do all the right things?!I think this was a wonderful story about how all of us are capable of terrible things if circumstances were there, such as greed, fear, the need to survive, or simply by just making BAD DECISIONS. These elements are all parts of the essence of noir, and that's why I consider this book one of the best examples of modern noir.Three friends stumble upon millions of dollars and decide to keep it and not tell the authorities. That one decision begins a terrible domino effect that leads to dire consequences. It's like a classic tragedy where the end is inevitable.Great book! Tightly written with great pacing!"}, {"userName": "Jeff ", "userReviewDate": "Jan 08, 2013", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/12618229-jeff", "userReview": "If you found four million dollars, what choices would you make?

The narrator tries to deal with the fallout from his decisions - rationalize his actions and bury the guilt. Coping and trying to move on, making excuses, but always with the memory of heinous acts just below the surface.

When the defendant was brought in, the Jewish man became hysterical and had to be dragged out of the courtroom. People assumed that seeing the Nazi's face again had simply brought back memories too horrific for the man to bear. He later explained that he'd lost his composure because he saw, for the first time, that this Nazi was not some fire-breathing monster, but just a man, like anyone else. Without the SS uniform, his humanity was laid bare. The Nazi could've been him; the Nazi could've been anyone. This incident illustrates why Scott Smith's novel \"A Simple Plan\" is unquestionably the scariest book I've ever read. By far more frightening than anything written by Stephen King, Dean Koontz or even Thomas Harris, \"A Simple Plan\" touches on an uncomfortable but real truth in life: we're all basically bad, posessing an almost infinite capacity for evil. All we need to find out how bad we can be is the right motivation: anger, lust, greed, jealousy, etc. For Hank, the novel's main protagonist, the motivation is greed, then fear. Hank is a midwestern accountant with a wife and a baby on the way, a real swell fella, anyone would agree. One Winter day, Hank takes a ride with his no-account brother, Jacob, and Jacob's pal, Lou. An accident sends the three trudging off into the woods, where they happen upon a small airplane that has crashed and been covered over with snow. Inside, they find a dead pilot and a gym bag, which happens to contain around $4 million. The men figure the money is from a drug deal or a robbery. Hank, the upstanding citizen of the group, insists on calling the authorities immediately. Jacob and Lou, however, want to hang onto the cash. Eventually, Hank agrees, but on one condition: they sit on the money for six months - if nothing is heard of it by Summer, they'll split the loot and go their separate ways. It seems painfully simple, but Hank doesn't take into account his brother's impulsive stupidity, or Lou's desperate need to have his share RIGHT NOW. The failings of his partners in crime, as well as his own fear of being caught, send Hank into a downward spiral as the situation gets bad, then worse, then really super-deluxe worse. Toward the end, when Hank is driven to extremes by his own wife's carelessness, the money becomes almost irrelevant. In a real stroke of genius, Smith tells the entire story from Hank's point of view, giving the reader unencumbered access to Hank's tortured psyche. You find yourself almost relating and understanding when Hank tells himself that the theft is justifiable, then when he graduates to blackmail and murder. A movie version of this story was made in 1998; it's absorbing, suspenseful and at times unforgettable. All the same, it's inferior to the novel, particularly in the second half. The ending in the film, while tragic and horrifying in its own right, doesn't even come close to the ending in the book, which may stay with me for the rest of my life. I found \"A Simple Plan\" at the discount table at the mall in 1995. The dust jacket preview seemed vaguely interesting, so I plucked down my $3.99 and took it home, expecting to read it over the Summer. I finished it two days later, at about 3:00 in the morning. It's that engrossing, and thought-provoking. At one point, Hank's wife, who turns out to be more ruthless than anyone else, says to him: \"No one would ever think you'd be capable of doing what you've done.\" That brilliant line is the entire book in a nutshell."}, {"userName": "Maciek", "userReviewDate": "Mar 21, 2012", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/2969647-maciek", "userReview": "Reading this novel is like watching a trainwreck taking place: you know it's terrible, you know you shouldn't do it, but somehow you can't look away from it taking place; its as if your eyes have been glued to the train and carriages, losing touch with the track, falling out, being squashed and destroyed, all with the incredibly loud and draining sound of screeching and bending metal. You look at the solid, rectangular shapes being transformed into crushed masses of steel, thrown around like they were miniature toys, as if some invisible God took to them in a moment of incredible and hopeless fury.The title of the book accurately describes its premise: In winter, three men stumble upon a wreckage of a small plane in the woods outside their city. Curious, they decide to investigate: one of the men peers inside, and sees that the pilot is dead. He notices a small duffle bag near the body, and takes it out. Of course, they open it and peer inside: what they find is 4,4 million dollars in packets of hundred dollar bills. They make a decision to keep the money; all agree on a simple plan to do nothing and just wait for six months and see if anyone would be looking for the money when the plane is discovered in spring. If not, then they will split it adequately and quietly leave town; if yes, the money will be burned to keep them out of trouble. Nothing to lose, but a lot to gain.A Simple Plan is narrated in the first person by Hank Mitchell, an accountant, husband, and soon to be father. His partners in crime are Jacob, his brother, and Lou, their mutual acquaintance. The setting is a small town of Ashenville, Northern Ohio. As one involved with money on a daily basis, Hank takes charge and takes the bag, intending to keep it. He'll either split it after six months, if there's no mention of missing money anywhere, or burn it immediately if there is. Only it's never this easy, is it? Another allegory with which the novel can be described is a domino sequence, one which goes through a spiral, lower and lower. The decision to keep the money is knocking over the first piece of the domino; the rest will soon follow.There is an incredible feeling of bleak hopelesness in this novel, right from the first sentence, where Hank describes the dreadful death of his parents in a car accident. Although he is married and lives comfortably well with an attractive wife, with whom he is expecting their first child, there is a general aura of unhappiness about him and the whole town of Ashfield. The greyness and mundanity of the region, where seemingly nothing happens, at least nothing of importance. Everything irrevocable changes for the three men when they decide to take the bag; they are now on something together, are a part of a scheme, even if it involves doing nothing at all. However, they have set something in motion; The butterfly has flapped its wings, the wind has been stirred.The first person narration allows the reader almost unlimited access to Hank's mind. We're both able and limited to seeing things the way he sees them. We see how he makes decision after decision, how he tries to find a best way out of the situations he find himself in, and how he tries to rationalize and justify his actions. It becomes obvious that A Simple Plan is not a simple thriller, as it might suggest, but a quite complex moral tale; where each decision has multiple consequences, each complicating the events further.An Amazon reviewer called the novel \"macbeth in Midwest\", and the comparison is very apt. It also reminded me of one of my favorite old movies, \"The Treasure of Sierra Madre\", which is notable for having Humphrey Bogart in his only role as an unlikable character. The plot of the novel is simple enough, but what makes it unique is that it gives us a chance to see inside the mind of a person whose life has been completely turned upside down in one moment, and see how far he is going to go as the situation develops. These characters are people who could be you or me; they just happened to be in one place at a certain time. It could happen to any of us; Scott Smith doesn't build a complex mystery, or center his book around action scenes. Its plot is simple - three guys find a bag full of money. Its tension almost entirely inside the mind. It's the mind that is most fascinating in this novel, the mind of Hank, his wife, his brother and Lou. What will they do with the bag? What would you do?A Simple Plan is a stylish debut in the vein of Dennis Lehane, unique, complex and memorable. I could barely put it down as I was reading it, and it will stay with me for a long time. It is simply so relatable; it is impossible not to relate to the characters and their discovery, not to put yourself in their place, wondering what would you do in their situation. This is what makes it terrifying. As Hank says: \"'It all makes sense. It all happened one thing after the other.\""}, {"userName": "Char", "userReviewDate": "Dec 01, 2011", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/6581119-char", "userReview": "I liked this book a lot!It was very easy to identify with Hank, the protagonist of this story. Imagine that you and your two siblings find a bag full of money in a plane that crashed that no one has yet discovered. Would you keep it or not? That is the gist of this story.Just think about how one simple lie in your life could spiral out of control...into more lies and things MUCH worse than that, even. That's exactly what happened here, It was very easy to take the next step with Hank, and then the next, and so on. At first, the reader feels sorry for him, but not for long as he tangles himself up further and further by the minute. The last quarter of this book turned into a nightmare from which I could not pull myself away. I did feel that the last scenes slightly stepped over the line of believability and for that I deducted one star.Overall, I enjoyed this story quite a bit and would recommend it to anyone that enjoys a fast paced thriller with some blood and gore.

This is a book with an interesting idea, fascinating plot, but is ruined by characters who are loathesome, less sympathetic than any I have read in my life, and who do absolutely nothing believable. And not only that but I don't believe that any of these crimes could be played out and go over without a hitch the way we are supposed to believe they did, so even from a technical standpoint I don't know how anyone could possibly buy into this garbage. I keep seeing reviewers stating things about a \"slipperly slope\" and this is a look at our dark side. No, this does not depict anyone on a slippery slope, or someone who is shocked by their own actions when put in a bad situation. It's not even about a nice, regular guy who gets forced into doing heinous things and is tortured with guilt or emotion. It depicts someone who is supposedly normal and average who leaps head first into being completely inhuman with zero remorse, zero emotion, zero conscience, zero regret. There is no subtle build up, no progression into evil, it's just simply a normal guy who finds money and immediately turns into a serial murderer at the drop of the hat and then is like \"huh, I am a killer now. Oh well.\" I realize money does weird things to people but this guy and his wife's reactions and actions are not believable on any level--while sure, maybe there are some people who might--MIGHT--do some of the things these two do, I do not believe for one moment that there would ever be two \"normal\" people on earth who would do what these two did over this money. I get that there have been many deadly duos in real life, don't get me wrong, but not like this. It's as though two sociopaths were simply waiting to be unleashed when the right circumstances came along. And the way the guy talks about his pregnant wife and even the baby before and after it's born...it was enough to make my stomach turn. But not too much because the wife is even crazier than he is. Then there is the whole segment where he describes in great detail how he could kill his infant and then his wife (oookay, as if the book weren't already atrocious enough we get to read that). And then there is the other segment in which he brutally and slowly kills a dog and buries in like one inch deep--oh, after having kept it tied to a tree for weeks with rotting sores all over its body out in the snow. YAY for even more beyond inhumane actions. And then the wife cooing \"Bye bye, doggie! Bye bye...\" to the baby when the husband takes it out to kill it. WTF, really?I have never read a book and felt SO unattached to the characters nor have I read a book and felt the characters were so utterly absurdly written that I couldn't believe a thing they did and could not have cared less about their fate--well, that's not true...I wanted them to die. There is no one to root for in the book. Only after Jacob and Lou are killed do we even realize that THEY were the most likable people in the story...which ain't sayin' much. Speaking of sociopaths, I think the author might be one! As to the hundreds of glowing reviews...I don't know what to say except how sad it is that there are so many people in the world who feel this is quality reading on any level. And how incredibly lucky the author is that so many people found this to be \"amazing.\" Birdcage liner...right here."}, {"userName": "Matthew", "userReviewDate": "Oct 01, 2007", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/133343-matthew", "userReview": "Scott Smith's books are, above all, methodical. For all their chaos and violence, everything seems inevitable, everyone acts logically, and yet, without fail, things go terribly, terribly wrong. It's impossible not to imagine yourself in his characters' places, wondering if you would have made similar decisions, acted in a similar way, and still come to the same calamitous end. His wildly entertaining second novel, The Ruins, placed its characters in an impossible situation that was articificial and supernatural, but his debut, A Simple Plan, is more powerful and frightening because the impossible situation is the characters' own damn fault entirely.He begins with a simple moral dilemma: if you stumbled upon a pile of cash, would you take it? What if there was little chance of you being caught? Hank, our narrator, discovers four million dollars in a downed plane buried in the snow. He's accompanied by his brother, Jacob, and Jacob's deadbeat friend, Lou. Together they decide on a \"simple plan\"; that is, take the money, but don't spend it until the plane is discovered and no one reports it missing. If anything goes wrong, they plan to burn the money instantly. Of course, everything goes horribly wrong. Despite Hank's best efforts to act logically and cover his tracks, the allure and power of the money proves to be too much to handle. Smith writes in (call me redundant) simple, declarative sentences, which suit his \"play-by-play\" style very well. It's agonizing to watch the characters make what seems to be a sound decision, only to see it backfire in the next scene. And Smith never flinches, so we are trapped in this downward spiral right along with them. Even when there's no imminent threat, when it seems, for a moment, that everything might be okay, when Hank is playing with his newborn baby, for example, or Jacob is thinking about buying back their family's barn, there is a sustained and suffocating sense of foreboding, which makes the characters' brief hope that much more heartbreaking. \"'I'm not crazy,' I said, trying to make my voice come out rational, calm. 'It all makes sense. It all happened one thing after the other.'\""}, {"userName": "Trudy", "userReviewDate": "Apr 21, 2008", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/1036503-trudy", "userReview": "This book was probably THE most painful reading experience I have ever had.

I am just too sensitive for that - I feel the pain and embarrasment they should be feeling but in some cases don't.

Bleak and mournful, it plays more like a tragedy than a thriller. What makes the first half of the novel is so devastatingly good is its simplicity. Smith comes across as a natural, plainspoken storyteller and the 'simple plan' of the title makes for a tale of suspense grounded in character in which the tension mounts, relentlessly, to an almost unbearable level. That same simplicity allows the story to achieve an almost mythic resonance, deepening into a timeless tale of human folly and moral erosion. It's all so good that the flawed nature of the second half of the book is that much more disappointing. Additional complications are introduced, rather heavy-handedly, and the story becomes more implausible and less gripping at the same time. The final act is particularly ill-conceived, bordering on nonsensical. Smith does close the novel on a grace note- the final few pages are quietly haunting. Intriguingly, in the twenty-plus years since the publication of this, his first novel, Smith has published only one more novel, The Ruins."}, {"userName": "Kirstin", "userReviewDate": "Nov 15, 2014", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/30037960-kirstin", "userReview": "Hank, his brother Jacob, and Jacob's best friend find the wreck of a small plane in the woods.

The ending is amazing. 3.5 stars"}, {"userName": "Asghar Abbas", "userReviewDate": "Aug 14, 2015", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/37421322-asghar-abbas", "userReview": "Hauntingly beautiful, a true tale of horror about being human.

Ripped through this audiobook in less than five days because the writing was high quality, the story was spectacular and the twists and turns kept me guessing. Oh and the ending was just as perfect as the sum of its parts. I am sure part of the reason I loved this so much is because I read it in the wake of a truly disappointing read (also a thriller) approved by the masses (i.e. NY Times Best Seller List). The writing was bad, the plot was far-fetched and contrived and the characters were depthless. Here, it was the complete opposite. The writing was truly excellent (for being a thriller at least... this isn't Whitman or anything), the themes addressed objective and subjective morality in a philosophical yet simple way, and the characters were multi-faceted, recognizable and (scarily) relatable. This book is a stark reminder of the common man's tendency and compulsion to endlessly justify his contemptible actions in furtherance of his own self-interest at the expense of others.Recommending this perfect thriller to everyone I can. It's GREAT on audio."}, {"userName": "Veeral", "userReviewDate": "Jun 24, 2012", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/6969151-veeral", "userReview": "A too simple story of crime and murder. That\u2019s what I thought once I finished this book. I predicted each and every move of our anti-hero beforehand and was waiting for Scott Smith to catch-up. I don\u2019t generally try to anticipate anything consciously whenever I am reading fiction as it would suck the joy out of it. But as it happened, I always knew precisely what was going to happen next. The story was that predictable. It seemed to me that Scott Smith had only one solution for the plight of his anti-hero. I wouldn\u2019t say outright what the solution was as I don\u2019t want to spoil anything for someone who might want to read this in future, but once you have read this, you would know what I am talking about. Also, I thought that the book was way too lengthy. It\u2019s not the taut crime-thriller one might expect by reading the blurb. Chopping off 100 pages might have done justice to the storyline.This was by no means bad, but it fell short on my expectations.I would recommend reading The Ax by Donald E. Westlake instead. It\u2019s unpredictable and not needlessly lengthy, just how an ideal crime fiction book should be.3 stars"}, {"userName": "\u03a0\u03b1\u03bd\u03b1\u03b3\u03b9\u03ce\u03c4\u03b7\u03c2 \u0394\u03b5\u03bb\u03b7\u03b3\u03b9\u03ac\u03bd\u03bd\u03b7\u03c2", "userReviewDate": "Sep 07, 2015", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/39266943", "userReview": "\u03a4\u03bf \u03b2\u03b9\u03b2\u03bb\u03af\u03bf \u03ad\u03c0\u03b5\u03c3\u03b5 \u03c4\u03c5\u03c7\u03b1\u03af\u03b1 \u03c3\u03c4\u03b1 \u03c7\u03ad\u03c1\u03b9\u03b1 \u03bc\u03bf\u03c5 \u03ba\u03b1\u03b9 \u03bd\u03b9\u03ce\u03b8\u03c9 \u03c4\u03c5\u03c7\u03b5\u03c1\u03cc\u03c2 \u03c0\u03bf\u03c5 \u03ad\u03b3\u03b9\u03bd\u03b5 \u03b1\u03c5\u03c4\u03cc.\u039e\u03b5\u03ba\u03b9\u03bd\u03ac\u03b5\u03b9 \u03b4\u03c5\u03bd\u03b1\u03bc\u03b9\u03ba\u03ac \u03ba\u03b1\u03b9 \u03b1\u03c0\u03cc \u03c3\u03b5\u03bb\u03af\u03b4\u03b1 \u03c3\u03b5 \u03c3\u03b5\u03bb\u03af\u03b4\u03b1 \u03b3\u03af\u03bd\u03b5\u03c4\u03b1\u03b9 \u03cc\u03bb\u03bf \u03ba\u03b1\u03b9 \u03c0\u03b9\u03bf \u03c0\u03bf\u03bb\u03cd\u03c0\u03bb\u03bf\u03ba\u03bf, \u03cc\u03bb\u03bf \u03ba\u03b1\u03b9 \u03c0\u03b9\u03bf \u03b1\u03b3\u03c7\u03c9\u03c4\u03b9\u03ba\u03cc.\u0386\u03c1\u03b1\u03b3\u03b5 \u03b8\u03b1 \u03ad\u03c1\u03b8\u03b5\u03b9 \u03b7 \u03bb\u03cd\u03c4\u03c1\u03c9\u03c3\u03b7 \u03b3\u03b9\u03b1 \u03c4\u03bf\u03bd \u03ae\u03c1\u03c9\u03b1?

Sharp, well written and interesting. I'm only 10% in so I'll update when finished. I like the idea of finding money and trying, morally, to decide what to do with it. Currently I'm of the mind take it and run as far and as fast as you can. I have a feeling this novel might change my mind...Finished. Excellent. You know those sort of boozy nights with mates when you discuss the bank robbery...how you'd carry it out, how to get away with it? (no? huh, I guess your mates aren't all ex-army...) I digress. Well read this book first if you are planning to steal a large amount of money. Money corrupts, basically, is the moral of this tale. Told entirely in the first person by Hank, the quiet, sane, rational tax accountant who has a wife and baby girl, we are dragged slowly but surely into a nightmare of deceit and violence by the lure of three and a half million dollars. I've read another book by this author The Ruins which was also excellent--more traditional horror than this one but particularly effective. I enjoyed the careful plotting of A Simple Plan...Hank wasn't stupid by any means, and he basically outwitted everyone at each step, taking the rational decision and doing what had to be done. It's only when you stand outside his calm, persuasive narration that you realise the horrific amoral monsters they have all become from the lure of the money. And you'd have to be either a saint or a very wealthy person not to feel that tug yourself. That's the fascinating thing about this story...asking yourself would I? Good read, highly recommended.
