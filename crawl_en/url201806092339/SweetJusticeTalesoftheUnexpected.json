And now that a neighbor woman has also disappeared, Tess decides to pursue the truth herself. But it\u2019s a dangerous, life and death game she decides to play, especially considering she\u2019s prone to passing out during unexplained fits.Tension builds steadily, including a troubling sexual tension that\u2019s key to the plot. Good description helps create the mood and bring the rural environment to life, including killing hogs and chickens, and unremitting summer heat without air conditioning. You can feel something bad is going to happen, but you don\u2019t know how it\u2019ll end until you actually get there.I received a free copy of the story in exchange for an honest, non-reciprocal review."}, {"userName": "Lindsay", "userReviewDate": "May 16, 2018", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/9731039-lindsay", "userReview": "Not sure why this is out of sequence as this is book 3!Tess is a young girl who suffers blackouts, she delivers mail to her neighbours and after one blackout comes to and finds her stepfather close by watching her.She finds blood in the doorway of the house she was visiting but scared goes home.She tells of her mother\u2019s disappearance 2 years past and how she finds her stepfather watching, always watching.She meets police from the city but they brush her off when she tries to explain what she\u2019s seen.She then decides to bait a trap to draw out the killer.A great read very well explained and just the right amount of nervousness and terror at the prospect of this young girl like a lamb to the slaughter!!"}, {"userName": "Michael Gardner", "userReviewDate": "Mar 30, 2016", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/21468115-michael-gardner", "userReview": "Sweet Justice is the third short story I\u2019ve read in this series and for my money the best. Although I wouldn\u2019t describe the violence or sexual content as explicit, it\u2019s a story for a mature audience. Creepy stuff. It\u2019ll make your skin crawl as you look over your shoulder to see if you\u2019re being watched.What I really liked was the simplicity of the story: small town, a handful of characters, unsolved (creepy) murders, and right in the middle, Tess, an emerging woman determined to find the truth. This story has its feet on the ground and I\u2019d quite believe it happened if I read about it in the newspaper.What I like the most about Ann Girdharry\u2019s writing is how she puts you right in the shoes of the characters. She has a knack for giving the reader the right attention to details, always showing the story as if unfolds. This makes for an absorbing read. Did I mention it\u2019s creepy?I received a free copy of this story from the author in exchange for an honest non-reciprocal review. Definitely a five star creepy read."}, {"userName": "Linda", "userReviewDate": "Apr 02, 2016", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/1846667-linda", "userReview": "I received this ARC in exchange for an honest review. 1960's America and Tess's mother has disappeared without a trace. The police and her stepfather said she had left them with Dirk and went to the city, but Tess knew her mom hadn't abandoned them. When Mrs. McGuire disappeared, Tess was taking the mail to her house and she blacked out. Once awake she saw the door was open and it wasn't before she blacked out. She stepped to the door and saw a copper red sustenance on the shiny floor and she stuck her finger in it knowing it was blood. Her stepfather startled her and she jumped then he told her to go home. As weeks went by and no trace of the two missing women was found Tess began to plan her trap and get answers that no one else bothered to do. But it was a dangerous game that she played."}, {"userName": "John Jones", "userReviewDate": "Feb 14, 2016", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/9822116-john-jones", "userReview": "Sweet Justice by Ann Girdharry is a tale about how a fourteen year old girl used her imagination and ingenuity to discover her mother's killer. No spoilers here! As an American reader, I immediately sensed the author was British. The recognizable idioms, the distant, well-starched prose and the quiet, stark descriptions reeked of late 19th Century English writers. As I read it, judging from the tone and style, I kept thinking I was reading something written by Thomas Hardy. The protagonist Tess is well-drawn and her sense of anguished desperation comes through clearly for the reader. The tension builds nicely from the first page to an explosive ending. The pace lags a little between plot points three and four, but overall, it's entertaining and a worthwhile read. I highly recommend!!"}, {"userName": "Mark Hayes", "userReviewDate": "Aug 27, 2015", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/23774202-mark-hayes", "userReview": "This is a darker tale than the first in the series, if only because it is grounded in the mundane. Again well told and crafted. The art of the short story requires not a word is wasted and Ann wastes none in this tale. A story which could have bene expanded to the plot of a whole novel is condensed perfectly in to the short form. A tale of dark intents and fear, told form the prospective of a victim striving to face the fear that dwells within her home. writesrightsrites.blogspot.co.uk"}, {"userName": "Christina Clark", "userReviewDate": "Sep 10, 2015", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/44807268-christina-clark", "userReview": "I received a free copy of this book in return for an honest review.This is a great read. Not having much experience of the short story genre, I was unsure what to expect, but found that I read it in one sitting \u2013 the author immediately pulls you into her story, and grips you until the end.The initial scene of a young girl awakening from an epileptic fit to discover blood all over the floor of a neighbour\u2019s house, sets the sinister background. The neighbour\u2019s wife is missing.The tale then revolves around thirteen year old Tess\u2019s search for the truth of the disappearance of this neighbour, and that of her own mother two years previously. Her child\u2019s perception of truth is shown to be that much stronger than that of the adults that surround her.The voice of a thirteen year old is very compelling, as Tess progresses from a rage-filled schoolgirl to a patient, calculating young adult, aware of, and very ready to exploit her own sexuality to reveal the truth.The atmospheric build-up is cleverly enhanced with blood and death images, and hot, sultry weather conditions.Definitely a recommended read, and I look forward to more from this author."}, {"userName": "Jon", "userReviewDate": "Jan 01, 2016", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/10036972-jon", "userReview": "Ann Girdharry has written a riveting short story that bubbles under with a gradually increasing claustrophobic and dangerous sexual tension that builds towards a thrilling and satisfying climax. The story imagines a somewhat repressed 1960s era US southern or midwest backwater - all oil lamps, livestock, ranches and verandas, shotguns and knives, cops and sheriffs, red dresses and stetsons, and above all plenty of dust and heat, mixed in with a heady helping of blood, sweat and tears - a bit of latter day \"Winter\u2019s Bone\" reimagined by Chandler or Steinbeck. Our wronged and feisty heroine Jess is driven to taking matters into her own hands as her advance into womanhood presents an opportunity to seize power over the dominant but ineffectual menfolk in her life in more ways than one. A keenly imagined and atmospheric short story you can knock off in half an hour \u2013 I look forward to checking out the others in the series."}, {"userName": "Pam", "userReviewDate": "Feb 04, 2016", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/7884584-pam", "userReview": "Sweet Justice: Tales of the Unexpected #2 is by Ann Girdharry. It is an unexpected novel to say the least. I definitely was not expecting the outcome. Tess went to the Maguires\u2019 house to get the mail for Mrs. Maguire. They had a swing on the front porch and Tess decided to take one swing before opening the door. Instead, she blacked out and fell. When she came to, the door was ajar and there was something dark on the floor. She tested it with her finger and found it was blood. Then her stepfather, Dirk, asked her what she was doing. He stood at the edge of the porch with blood on his clothes. He said he had been working castrating the horses. She wasn\u2019t sure she believed him. Later when Mr. Maguire reported his wife was missing, Tess could only remember when her mother came up missing. What is going on? It is a quick read and a good book."}, {"userName": "Felicity Nichols", "userReviewDate": "Jan 24, 2016", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/23748916-felicity-nichols", "userReview": "I had goosebumps as I read Sweet Justice. Tess has Epilepsy but it hasn't been diagnosed as that officially. Her mother mysteriously disappeared and she never felt settled with the idea that she just ran off for a better life. She knows better than to believe that.When she catches her step-father Dirk cleaning blood out of a house claiming to be an animal's castration gone wrong she can't fight that feeling that something has gone wrong. She tries to tell the police what she saw but they think she is misguided in believing that her step-father has killed again.Determined to take justice into her own hands she sets a trap for a dangerous game of cat and mouse. Sweet Justice although short will capture you from page one and you'll finish in one sitting awaiting the climatic conclusion."}, {"userName": "K. Kumar", "userReviewDate": "Feb 06, 2016", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/22602677-k-kumar", "userReview": "Sweet Justice is a short, dark story about a young girl struggling with the loss of her mother and dealing with an abusive stepfather. In the beginning, Tess suffers from a seizure and when she wakes up she becomes a witness to a disturbing crime. Throughout the story Tess is in a constant struggle with her stepfather, while at the same time trying to protect her brother and find out about the disappearance of her mother.Overall, Sweet Justice was a challenging read, but it is well written and suspenseful. One aspect I think some readers will connect with is the powerlessness of Tess's character in the midst of losing her mother and facing the abuse of her step-father. Despite that, she was always looking to find some peace from the challenging circumstances."}, {"userName": "Stephen Carter", "userReviewDate": "Aug 31, 2015", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/19006571-stephen-carter", "userReview": "\u2018Sweet Justice\u2019 is a story of real psychological horror. Justice is served to someone who \u2013 actively, fully-engaged, deliberately \u2013 chose a life of evil and depravity. Redress, whether imposed by society or the victim, should be as deliberately taken. The story rightly hints that to leave such evil unaddressed, free to repeat his crimes, would be to sanction his chosen course. This well-told short story, Book 2 in the \u2018Tales of the Unexpected\u2019 series, is a compelling narrative of necessary justice."}, {"userName": "Sarah", "userReviewDate": "Apr 17, 2016", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/7591340-sarah", "userReview": "(Source: I received a digital copy of this book for free on a read-to-review basis.
