This was originally a talk he gave as the 2007 Northrop Fry Lecturer and which was published in 2008.Richards is addressing mainly young writers and confesses that it is not always easy to remain true to yourself, but it is essential. He advises writers to say what they want to from the get go and not to bow to what they think others want to hear and compromise in order to fit in. He strives for his characters to maintain integrity. Write how you feel, not how others think you should feel."}], "description": "Playing the Inside Out is David Adams Richard's distilled insight on the artist's struggle for full access to artistic integrity by remaining an outsider to convention. Richards conjures forth his vision of eternal truths commonly held by all mankind, a Miramichi cosmic consciousness that he has been working at all his life. In an entertaining, remonstrating, and ultimately uplifting essay he identifies how conformity and laziness poison artists, and the great pressures that exist for writers to \"join the herd.\"No one can possibly read this essay and not find comments or conclusions that directly relate to them. The writer's challenge to find and protect one's inner honesty is deeply familiar to anyone seeking to be faithful to the true sense of \"I\" that dominates motivation and judgement. So personal are the truths that Richards lays out, that an inmate, politician, nurse, teenager, farmer, teacher -- anyone who reads -- all will feel Richards' passion and find value in his practical wisdom and encouragement.Playing the Inside Out is shrewd analysis; a personal advisory directed at artists and writers in particular. But Richards' topic and manner of address are egalitarian. He is telling us to be who we are -- honestly, consistently, and with heart.Depuis plus de trente ans, l'?crivain David Adams Richards?puise dans l'exp?rience de la marginalit? de la Miramichi?pour approfondir l'int?rieur de l'?tre humain, l? o? de loge le vrai. Dans cet essai, Richards d?peint le rapport de r?sistance cr?ative qu'il entretient avec l'alt?rit? stigmatisant qui menace l'authenticit? et exprime son app?tence d'aller au-del? des apparences. L'approche sociale et existentielle qu'il adopte dans son parcours litt?raire et personnel privil?gie la r?v?lation d'un vrai possible, qu'il incarne assur?ment lui-m?me en tant qu'?crivain.Tel qu'il le fait dans son essai et ? l'instar de ses romans, David Adams Richards contredit, d?place et transforme le discours h?g?monique pour privil?gier le vrai. L'?crivain nous raconte des histoires qui se d?roulent dans un endroit qui devient seul lieu et tout lieu. L'esth?tique du r?cit assume l'authenticit? que poss?de une valeur d'expansion permettant d'acc?der ? des lois plus puissantes. La d?marche de Richards s'inscrit humblement dans une tentative de sonder une r?alit? plus proche de l'?tre fondamental, voire universelle, au-del? des apparences.", "title": "Playing the Inside Out / Le Jeu Des Apparences", "url": "http://www.goodreads.com/book/show/2861320-playing-the-inside-out-le-jeu-des-apparences", "average": 3.2, "cover": "https://images.gr-assets.com/books/1396836725l/2861320.jpg", "reviews": 1, "authors": [{"url": "https://www.goodreads.com/author/show/87458.David_Adams_Richards", "name": "David Adams Richards"}], "type": [], "outlinks": ["http://www.goodreads.com/book/show/2861320-playing-the-inside-out-le-jeu-des-apparences", "http://www.goodreads.com/book/show/151381.Mercy_Among_the_Children", "http://www.goodreads.com/book/show/1110344.Nights_Below_Station_Street", "http://www.goodreads.com/book/show/1110346.The_Friends_of_Meager_Fortune", "http://www.goodreads.com/book/show/1110347.River_of_the_Brokenhearted", "http://www.goodreads.com/book/show/1425484.The_Bay_of_Love_and_Sorrows"]}
