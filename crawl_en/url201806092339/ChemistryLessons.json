Maya is a decent character. She\u2019s smart and even though she\u2019s heartbroken, she has good intentions. Sadly, those intentions didn\u2019t translate to character growth. I get that the experiment was important; however, she was quite careless when it came to the feelings of others. Plot wise, it was sort of boring. I didn\u2019t see the appeal of the boyfriend and the other \u201ctest subjects\u201d are kept at a fairly shallow level. And since the entire goal of the story was for Maya to get back with the ex boyfriend, I struggled to stay interested.

What it really has going for it is the emphasis on science. You don't often see that to the degree depicted here Maya lost her mother to cancer, but hopes to follow in her footsteps by becoming a great scientist. The book is set the summer before college begins (at MIT of course) while she is interning at an MIT lab. Everything is going as planned, until her long-time boyfriend suddenly dumps her for someone else. When Maya learns that her mother had secretly done research involving pheromones and attraction, she concocts a crazy plan to get her boyfriend back. Maya teams up with her mom's former grad student to carry on this work with experiments. Plural because they need controls to know for sure if there is actually an effect (of course). A big concern I had while reading this book was how unethical the research is, especially with unknowing participants. Happily, the issue of ethics is eventually addressed fairly well, but it bugged me through a lot of the book. So be aware, in terms of science, everything that Maya does is VERY unethical and not good research, but she's also 17 and dumb and broken-hearted. The grad student should have known better, but that's a separate issue.But leaving aside the issue of ethical research, the book had some very funny moments and some cute things develop. It's a quick read and a light one for the most part. But it DOES get specific about science, which is awesome! Maya's mom focused mostly on epigenetics, the study of genetic markers in predicting diseases, and there is quite the smattering of scientific explanations and terminology woven throughout the story. I think it's done well without being too heavy-handed. As a character, Maya is book smart, but is still figuring everything else out. Which I certainly identified with at her age.If you're looking for a light contemporary with a sciencey twist, I do recommend this one!

I thought it would be apt to select the second arc I received from Yallwest. I actually missed an upcoming ARC drop because of this book so I might as well read this one first. If you want to read about my *first* Yallwest experience, click here. But if you just want to read my review for Chemistry Lessons, then just stick around (and read on)!\nChemistry Lessons\n was such a delight to read! I think everyone can relate to its protagonist (Mara) as she tries to unlock the secret/s to long-lasting attraction. The reasoning behind this was to keep eros and/or passion alive. I mean, at some point, the excitement in seeing one\u2019s significant other declines. The idea was to prolong the feeling attraction as if a couple were just in the initial stage of their relationship. What does my ramble have anything to do with this book? Well, Mara didn\u2019t take her breakup very well and she wanted her ex to come back to her. Because of Mara\u2019s interest in science and her summer internship position at MIT, she was able to conduct an experiment that may well be the answer to her dilemma.I was completely engrossed in this story even if I knew that this experiment wasn\u2019t going to work as expected. Only because Mara\u2019s experiment was flawed from the start. How would she measure attraction, for instance? Even if she did make up a scale or a measurement for attraction, her results could still be influenced by outside factors since she had no control over different variables (i.e. the treatment given to her subjects and/or the setting of her experiment, etc). Henceforth, she can\u2019t produce definitive result/s (and that was precisely the point). As a psychology major, I\u2019ve been drilled to minimize bias or other factors that could affect the results of an experiment. I can go on and on but that\u2019s not the point of this review. I didn\u2019t even know why Ann agreed to Mara\u2019s idea. Did grief made Ann completely forget the fact that Mara was still an incoming college freshman? Probably. This is why the novel was fun to read.And yet I devoured this novel in ONE day. I liked how the result of the experiment was just like the ending of this story: inconclusive. It showed that there was more to Mara\u2019s story besides the failure of her first relationship or the impossible cure to a breakup. And how the ugly feeling that comes along with a breakup was inevitable but ephemeral. There\u2019s more to look forward to in Mara\u2019s life such as college, friendships, a potential career, etc. All in all, it has this bittersweet ending and it sort of made me want to hug this book because I fell in love with its story and its main characters. I\u2019d totally recommend this one!**This review and more can be found in my book blog."}, {"userName": "Just Another Bookish Blog", "userReviewDate": "Feb 13, 2018", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/42626909-just-another-bookish-blog", "userReview": "I recently finished reading Chemistry Lessons, by Meredith Goldstein!Oh look, I finished this book right on time for Valentine's dayNote: I received this book as an eARC from NetGalley! This does not affect my opinion on the storyline, plot, writing, or any other point of interest. Thank you for sending it to me!This will be published on June 19th, 2018 This book was not what I expected, in any way! You have Maya, a student working on her internship before joining MIT to study epigenetics. Her mother died and dedicated her laboratory research to her - using a love interest's genes to alter your own genes to increase attraction via pheromones. Maya continues on this work on her own, testing the formula on three test subject - her friend, a stranger, and her ex. This secret project makes her realize the value of personal relationships of all kinds, and tests her in many situations that may happen to anyone.This book was easily readable - it was smooth, there were no empty chapters, and the scientific ideas were easy understandable and well explained. Easy-reading contemporaries make for really nice summer reads!I did have a little problem when it comes to the plot of the book, at first. It struck me as odd that the main character saw nothing strange in altering her own chemical signature in order to see if unknowing test subjects would feel any unusual romantic attraction to her. As someone who even finds online dating to be an uncomfortable idea, her lack of realization in the ethics of the experiment surprised me. Not only that, but as a scientist, it was obvious to me that the experiment had many flaws, namely the lack of regularity in the experiments. Her friend Bryan often had the same mindset as I did throughout the book, regarding Maya' s actions and decisions. However, Maya realizes all of this by the end of the book, and makes it up to everyone in various ways. This redeemed the book for me, however did not get rid of the fact that the first 90% of the book seemed odd both ethically and scientifically.The book was overall a very light read. Where some contemporaries are heavy on mental illness or other topics, this was simply a college girl science-ing the hell out of trying to get back with her ex, and growing on the way. It was a cute, light read, good for anyone who wants to read something that is technically a science fiction but is disguised in a contemporary form. The mix of sub-genres including science, family, theater, love and growing up was a lovely blend that showed that anyone can find themselves in this story.Finally, I appreciated the realism of the side characters in this book - they were a good representation of the people you may meet in college. Diverse characters, the best friend, the flamboyant guy who doesn't mind who he spends time with at a party, the unrealized crush, the one having a hard time getting over their ex, the ambitious one... it made it easy to find a place in the book as a reader!I'm giving this book a 3.5/5 Feathers!"}, {"userName": "Renata", "userReviewDate": "Mar 26, 2018", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/75319-renata", "userReview": "I will admit that I side-eyed this premise (high school chemistry intern decides to carry on her dead scientist mom's research into pheremones, in an attempt to get her boyfriend to get back together with her) but really enjoyed the book! Maya and her BFF Bryan are great characters. I also enjoyed all the fun Cambridge/MIT-specific details to the setting. I also appreciated that the cast is fairly diverse. Without going into too many details, I do think the ethical/scientific questionability of the whole thing is addressed in a way that left me, at least, satisfied, though obviously it still would not hold up to, you know, scientific scrutiny.

The synopsis is intriguing, but I found the actual plot to be a little lackluster. Maya's an okay character, but I really didn't understand or feel her connection to Whit, and considering the whole story hinges around her conducting this experiment to win him back, I had a difficult time getting invested.The plot revolves around Maya getting dumped by her boyfriend and deciding to unearth her deceased mother's research to win him back by using pheromones. Super interesting, right? Well, she and her mom's former assistant conduct the experiment on three cute guys in Maya's life--a platonic friend, a stranger, and the ex. Ethically speaking, it raised my eyebrows, and Maya simply did not seem to care about messing with people's emotions.

I can't even tell you how excited I was when I got approved for my request. So, once again, thank you.This book was so cute, but also dramatic. I loved the aspect of a teenage girl exploring the scientific factors of love. I'm not a huge science geek, but I know enough about it to understand what was going on in this book.Maya is a senior in high school, and her boyfriend broke up with her before their \"big night\". This actually really affects her throughout the first few chapters, which is understandable and relatable. I may only be a freshman in high school right now, but I at least know what it looks and feels like to be broken up with someone. She's heartbroken and feels like it's the end of her world.\"That's part of the issue, Maya. I think on some level I'm finally admitting to myself that you and I are just too different.\"This part, I can understand. Maya and her boyfriend ARE different, and you can see this throughout the entire book. There are hints everywhere! I know that would be hard to admit to any girl who is hearing the words \"I'm breaking up with you\" for the first time.This also helps to build up Maya's character development A LOT. She was already pretty determined before this happened, just not about such a specific subject. She works as a part-time\u00a0intern at the Massachusetts Institute of Technology, so she's pretty much set for where she is going to go to college as well as who she will have as friends. I don't think she ever actually considered what her life would be without her boyfriend, and that's part of the problem why she is so hurt. She had her entire life mapped out, and he was apart of ALL of it.This, I actually found to be a little make-believe. I know some girls and guys out in the world believe they have everything and expect to stay together with their partner forever. But in some cases, that isn't always true. I really got the feeling as if Maya's relationship with her boyfriend was perfect, and by that, I mean that they never had any problems with anything.Moving on from that, Maya's best friend Bryan is one character you can't take out of this book. He is literally always there for her, and he's always making sure she is okay. Especially after her breakup, Bryan was there to comfort her. I found this to be absolutely amazing, mainly because everyone wants that friend who is there to help pick up the pieces after everything goes down.\"Of course he'd do this right before you took off for Plymouth for a long weekend. He knew you'd disappear and be someone else's problem for the next few days.\"This is a part I knew I couldn't forget. Bryan has a way of hitting Maya with the awful truth of it all, but at the same time, cheering her up. She's already lost her mom, and now she's lost her boyfriend. I think it's safe to say that she is going to need her friend more than anything at this point, and I loved the fact that this character was added to this book. Without him, I feel like this story would have been incomplete.The last thing I want to talk about is Maya's mother's experiments. While I don't support the secret experimenting of pheromone levels on your best friend and stranger (this wasn't Bryan, I promise), I did like how it helped out this story. In a way, she was connecting with her deceased mother by continuing an experiment she had done before she died. This was extremely sad to see Maya getting emotional over, but I also loved how she finally knew that she was doing something her mother would have wanted to do.To wrap this up, I want to give one last thank you to HMHteen for sending me this book for review. I loved it, and I know I will definitely be reading more from Meredith Goldstein soon. For everything I talked about, I am giving this book 4/5 stars. I do suggest preordering this book, and I hope you all like it!"}, {"userName": "Susan McGrath", "userReviewDate": "May 25, 2018", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/22397391-susan-mcgrath", "userReview": "I received a copy of Chemistry Lessons by Meredith Goldstein from the publisher (Houghton Mifflin Harcourt) in exchange for an honest review.Maya is ready.

She finds solace in the boxes of research her mom left her in her will. She also finds what she needs to get Whit back. Maybe. Maya will have to conduct an experiment. With the help of her mom\u2019s graduate student, Maya plans to test her mom\u2019s pheromone formula on Whit. But first, she needs a couple of control subjects. A close friend, and a relative stranger.As often happens in science, the results are not quite what Maya expects. What I loved most about this novel was the focus on women in science. There are men in the lab where Maya works, but the researchers that drive the story forward are all female. The female characters throughout are relatively well drawn. Maya\u2019s challenges are realistic, given her specific history. The women around her aren\u2019t quite as fleshed out as Maya, but they all have their own stories.I did struggle a bit with the male characters in the story. Overall, they are less developed, in particular Maya\u2019s dad. I had a difficult time getting a sense of him in relationship to Maya and the story as a whole.I also appreciated that the story wasn\u2019t based on a vague, improbable love potion. Instead, the magic formula is rooted in actual science, though it may not work quite the way it does in this novel.While the story did end pretty much the way I expected, I was not disappointed.

However after reading the back and learning that it was about science and MIT, I was super intrigued. But I wished this book took place more at MIT and just had more science. I learned more about Bryan's life as an actor more than Maya's as a scientist. Another part that kind of annoyed me was how it says she lives a mile from the campus, yet she's moving into a dorm, and insists on bringing all her \"winter clothes\". Umm.....And regarding the experiment they were doing, they just tested it, they didn't really work on it at all.

Overall, a great book to read if you are looking for something light hearted with a little bit of angst as there are several moments when you\u2019re like \u2018Maya why would you do that?\u2019."}, {"userName": "Elaine", "userReviewDate": "Nov 11, 2017", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/44686212-elaine", "userReview": "I was excited to read this book as I am a chemist myself. It was over all a cute read about a girl, Maya, trying to figure out her love life. Here's what I liked: There was a somewhat nerdy main character and that there was talk of lab work at MIT. What I didn't like was that there were too many gay characters--almost as if the author was trying to force some diversity into this book and there was too much talk of casual sex for my taste. I also felt that the ending was rushed and a bit forced. Overall 3 stars."}, {"userName": "Ashlynn", "userReviewDate": "Nov 22, 2017", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/5491307-ashlynn", "userReview": "I loved this book. And I feel a little guilty for loving it so much. I mean, the plot is like something lifted straight out of a Disney Channel original movie. The teenaged protagonist hilariously and cluelessly makes a mess of all of her relationships through a series of ridiculous and unethical scientific experiments before she finally learns that you can't artificially engineer a relationship. (Maybe, it's schadenfreude that kept me reading? That has to be it, definitely the schadenfreude.) Regardless, if you're looking for fun, smart fluff Chemistry Lessons is for you."}, {"userName": "Teresa", "userReviewDate": "Dec 27, 2017", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/51766846-teresa", "userReview": "Maya is a genius; she is about to attend MIT, she has a great, supportive father and a boyfriend she loves...that is until she doesn't.

Things start to get messy from there and pretty soon Maya starts to learn that love can't be made from lab materials.

I enjoyed the character, who's nerdy, but relies on what she knows to solve problems. Some of the side character's seem added in at the last minute or to fill gaps. Not sure. I would have given this four stars, but parts didn't feel fluid at times. I can see teens and young adults really enjoying this book and would recommend buying for our library."}, {"userName": "Megan Lyons", "userReviewDate": "Apr 28, 2018", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/1861824-megan-lyons", "userReview": "2 1/2 stars I read this during this weird early spring heat wave, and this worked as a light summer read. I think I liked it more than it perhaps deserved, but I read through it quickly and enjoyed it. I liked the lab setting, although there wasn\u2019t a lot of time really spent there, and the science was questionable, there were moments that reminded me of funny stories my science research lab friends tell. I liked that the main character was intelligent and knew what she wanted in life, if not in love. She also had a sweet relationship with her best friend. I also liked that she did some pretty sketchy morally gray stuff that she learned from, and I liked where the romance led.  Was it a great novel? Definitely not, but I had fun reading it. I feel like the little bit of science might draw some readers, but it wasn\u2019t really a strong, yay girlpower type of read."}, {"userName": "Mary Nguyen (fox & wit)", "userReviewDate": "May 29, 2018", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/65136088-mary-nguyen-fox-wit", "userReview": "I enjoyed this a lot more than I thought I would. This book wasn\u2019t on my radar but I received an arc of it so I decided to read it.It\u2019s very cute and sweet. If you\u2019ve been through a yucky break up I think this book does a good job portraying those emotions.While it\u2019s certainly predictable and filled with typical YA contemporary tropes, it was still a delightful read.

The concept of trying to chemically make someone attracted to you is somewhat unethical but intriguing at the same time. Maya was a bit emotionally immature, however, she is only 17, so it\u2019s not that unsurprising. The story moved quickly, and I wanted to know what would happen next. It\u2019s definitely one of the better YA romances.

Then Whit dumps her out of the blue. Maya is miserable until she discovers that her scientist mother, before she died, was conducting research on manipulating pheromones to enhance human attraction. If Maya can finish her mother\u2019s work, maybe she can get Whit back. But when her experiment creates chaos in her love life, she realizes that maybe love and loss can\u2019t be understood using the scientific method. Can she learn to trust the unmeasurables of love and attraction instead?", "title": "Chemistry Lessons", "url": "http://www.goodreads.com/book/show/35721228-chemistry-lessons", "average": 3.49, "cover": "https://images.gr-assets.com/books/1520608093l/35721228.jpg", "reviews": 37, "authors": [{"url": "https://www.goodreads.com/author/show/5026200.Meredith_Goldstein", "name": "Meredith Goldstein"}], "type": ["Young Adult", "Contemporary"], "outlinks": ["http://www.goodreads.com/book/show/35721228-chemistry-lessons", "http://www.goodreads.com/book/show/32070436-chemistry-lessons", "http://www.goodreads.com/book/show/38115554-chemistry-lessons", "http://www.goodreads.com/book/show/13034044-the-singles", "http://www.goodreads.com/book/show/35959788-can-t-help-myself", "http://www.goodreads.com/book/show/15725970-the-wedding-guests"]}
