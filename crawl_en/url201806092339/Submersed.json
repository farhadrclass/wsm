I liked the whole concept of a girl with a tragic past hiding in her condo because she suffered something horrific. Olivia needs to go to a charity even that is hosted by her father. Not wanting to worry her dad anymore that she never interacts with people, she looks up a male escort on the internet for date. This way she does not have to interact any more than she has to. She just needs to get through the night. However, what Olivia does not expect is the handsome and charismatic escort, Dillon. Dillon was very likable. He just seemed so down to earth. I can\u2019t think of any other words to describe this guy. I think he brought out the best in Olivia. Almost god sent. He made her laugh, he made her feel comfortable, he was kind and he brought no drama to her life. He did not judge.I think what happened to Olivia that made her close herself off from society, happens to a lot of girls. I just think that many are just too afraid to admit it. It may not seem like something that drastic, but I think I can see how it can really mess up with someone feeling safe.I was glad to hear from the author that there is going to be a sequel, because I do not like the way it ended at all. If there was not going to be a sequel, I was going to give it 3 stars. It was very matter of fact kind of ending. I don\u2019t know how else to say it without giving it away. I am wondering about something in the book, but not sure if I want it answered. I am glad I read it. I cannot pass a book with a gigolo in it. *smiley face with a wink* I will be checking out more books by this author."}, {"userName": "Jessie", "userReviewDate": "Dec 19, 2012", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/15513355-jessie", "userReview": "4.5 stars! I'm glad that the ratings did not sway my decision to read this book. I absolutely loved it! The characters were great! Olivia and Dillon had great chemistry and the plot was interesting. Olivia suffers from extreme anxiety due to difficult things in her past and the story is the journey she goes through to overcome it. I actually enjoyed the ending because it wasn't what you expected it to be. Don't get me wrong, I love happily ever after endings but this ending gave a little twist which was a welcomed surprise. There were a few funny parts which was nice and the sexual tension between the Dillon and Olivia was hot! \n \"Dillon had that type of confidence I wished I could bottle up and take a swig of from time to time.\""}, {"userName": "Lara", "userReviewDate": "Oct 05, 2013", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/12835379-lara", "userReview": "This was a great story to me. Olivia is agoraphobic and lives isolated in her apartment where she basically only sees staff and her father. Because of a situation in her past, she`s afraid of what others will think about her and thinks their laughter must be invariably directed at her ridiculousness. That`s when she meets Dillon, a gigolo, and through each other they start to believe in their worth and capability. Although the book was a great read throughout, to me the end was its top mark. I was afraid that in the end, she`d just change from being insecure to come to depend on Dillon`s support. But Olivia comes to gradually grow more self-confident and leave her shell, Dillon or no Dillon, and I just loved it."}, {"userName": "BonnieSkywalker", "userReviewDate": "May 07, 2013", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/19190401-bonnieskywalker", "userReview": "Dillon; free screen capture softwareDillon is one of the sweetest heros ever.
