I\u2019m not gonna lie, I nearly DNFed it several times. Not because it isn\u2019t good, not because it\u2019s poorly written, and not because it doesn\u2019t have a message. It\u2019s just not an easy book to read. The MC didn\u2019t grow up too quickly; she never had a childhood at all. She was born in an asylum and shit went downhill for her from there. So\u2026yeah. I don\u2019t even know how to describe this other than to say that it's about a broken child growing up surrounded by other broken people, in a broken system. It\u2019s not pretty, it\u2019s not uplifting, and it\u2019s not for the faint of heart. I struggled to determine how to rate this, but because of the emotions it pulled from me, it\u2019s getting ALL the stars. Do I recommend it? Absolutely.

I guess I\u2019m just going to get right to brass tacks here. The Panopticon is not an easy book \u2013 either to read or to review. It\u2019s a book that I imagine will have an abundance of both 1 Star and 5 Star ratings and one that many people \u201cwon\u2019t get.\u201d I generally hate the use of that term, but since I\u2019m not sure I completely \u201cgot\u201d this one, I\u2019m feeling it\u2019s probably okay for me to use in this case. I\u2019ll admit, I almost threw in the towel with the free association style of first person narration. Not to mention how troubled I was by the story itself \u2013 the story of Anais, a 15-year old girl who was born into the system and has been designated a \u201cLifer.\u201d It really didn\u2019t help matters to see that Goodreads had The Panopticon classified as a Young Adult novel. With the amount of fucks and cunts and drugs and cutting and rape and death, this was not your typical YA fare. So, what exactly happened that made me keep plugging along? I stopped wondering what the \u201cpoint\u201d of the words was going to end up being at the end of the story (hell, I stopped wondering what the words were PERIOD and broke out the Scottish-to-English dialect translator in my brain) and just started reading the words themselves . . . \n \u201cImagine being the daughter of an Outcast Queen, imagine being a daughter!

Today? It\u2019s getting 5 Stars. Why? Because it made me feel things (and it takes A LOT to make me feel things). It also made me accept its status as a book for young adults.

In fact the PhD I am trying to battle through at the moment has more than a nod to them. So I picked up this novel- not ordinarily my sort of thing- out of interest regarding the title and elements of the story. I\u2019m pleased I did. It is, as they say, an accomplished debut, quite something of a page-turner but also unexpectedly literary and with a first-person narrative that, bar a few squelchy, over-written moments, feels authentic. Full of vituperations and hard long stares at the darkest, seediest underbelly you could imagine- perhaps beyond even that- it is appropriate that Irvine Welsh is a champion of the book in the blurb on the back because the story is certainly a daughter of \u2018Transporting.\u2019 I understood the Scottish slang as an Englishman who has spent enough time north of the border but maybe it will stretch others.The narrator, Anais, an out-of-control 15 year old girl, has spent her life in care being passed from wavering hands back to the State and out again, ad infinitum. It is not surprising that this has added to her issues regarding lack of identity; she has never known her biological family, does not even know what they look like. The \u2018birthday game\u2019 she regularly plays with herself gives her the opportunity to manufacture a thousand and one different origins for herself, her favourite being the notion that she had a childhood in Paris with a mother who listened to jazz.It is easy to see why Anais is a fantasist. Her experiences include rape, drug and alcohol use from an early age, finding the (murdered) body of a loved one and a lifetime spent in a system that fails the majority of those in its care (we are told that 70% of people who grew up in care will end up in prison or an asylum or dead not long after coming of age). Like the other \u2018clients\u2019 in her new home, the menacing Panopticon for problem kids, escapism seems something undertaken not out of choice but out of necessity. The book follows Anais\u2019 wrenching journey and as such is recommended- but be prepared for extreme subject matter, including child abuse, self-mutilation and bestiality along the way. This is not a gentle read although the author\u2019s gift is in making the story seem more than sensationalism. You want Anais\u2019 story resolved. You are invested in her journey.The one problem I had with the novel, bar a small amount of uneven writing already mentioned (not least towards the very end), is the fact that the unit for problem children is called \u2018the Panopticon.\u2019 The author can just about get away with the book\u2019s title as Anais\u2019 life in care (and probably her rampant use of recreational drugs) has left her convinced she is being watched at all times by people she can not see. But for a novel that seems to be aiming to portray the shocking reality of life for the unluckiest children of this apparently wealthy, civilised country, the notion that a children\u2019s unit would ever be called \u2018the panopticon\u2019 is, at best, fantasy and, at worst, na\u00efve and unthought-through. Jeremy Bentham, the English philosopher who came up with the idea of the panopticon, spent his life trying to get one built, with very limited success. A few centuries later Michel Foucault put paid to the notion of a true panopticon ever being constructed, savaging the idea in his \u2018Discipline and Punish\u2019 treatise as \u2018a cruel, ingenious cage.\u2019 So \u2018the Panopticon\u2019 simply does not work as the name of a Social Services-run home for children. It just would not happen. This isn\u2019t to say, of course, that there isn\u2019t a sense of the panopticon (or even \u2018the experiment\u2019 to which Anais keeps referring) to life for such children. But then there is the sense of us all being in a panopticon in this modern age of incessant CCTV, of states snooping on its citizens through the internet, of Edward Snowden and his ilk giving us a glimpse of the chamber in the panopticon where reside the people that watch us. If the novel had been called \u2018The Panopticon\u2019 but the unit called \u2018Meadowside\u2019 or some other bucolic fiction it would have heightened the gap between the perception of \u2018doing good\u2019 for these abandoned kids and the reality of the care they are given, not just by social workers and unit staff but by a society that has always preferred- ironically- not to \u2018see\u2019 them."}, {"userName": "Shannon (Giraffe Days)", "userReviewDate": "Jul 11, 2013", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/395599-shannon-giraffe-days", "userReview": "Anais Hendricks is fifteen years old. That's fifteen years of living in care: foster homes, mostly, and \"units\" with other teens. In fact, she's been through over fifty \"placements\" already: twenty-four before she was seven, when she was adopted by a professional prostitute called Teresa; then another twenty-seven times from the age of eleven, when her new mother was killed by one of her clients in their apartment. She doesn't know who her real mother is - no one does - and she routinely plays the \"birthday game\", where she imagines a different start for herself, a family maybe, or a posh life in Paris. She'd love to go to Paris. But a strong part of her knows that the experiment is watching. It's always watching, waiting for the moment to take her back and reveal the test tube she came from and subject her to further experimentation.Arriving at the Panopticon seems to fit right in with her theory about the experiment. It's a semi-circular building where the interior is open to the all-seeing watchtower in the middle; dating back to a pervious era and a life as an asylum, it's well fitted for wayward teens like Anais. She's been brought here by the police with blood all over her school uniform - but she hasn't been charged. There's no evidence that she put PC Craig in a coma, nothing but their prior volatile, antagonistic relationship and Anais's hefty track record: she's been brought in for countless acts of vandalism, violence, trafficking, and more. But while she doesn't remember anything from that day, she's sure she had nothing to do with the police constable's current state.At the Panopticon, she meets and befriends the other girls: Tash, fifteen and working the streets at night; her girlfriend Isla, who has two-year-old twins living in foster care and cuts her belly out of guilt for passing AIDS onto them - a disease she had no idea she had, after catching it herself from using her father's drug kit one time; and Shortie, who picks a fight with Anais after which the two become close. There are boys here too: John, cute and a thief; twelve-year-old Dylan and Brian, whom they all hate after catching him doing something despicable. It's the only family Anais has, and it's not bad, as family's go. Even if the watchtower is always watching, and her social worker is never around to support her, and her ex-boyfriend keeps pestering her from jail.But the tight net of the system is closing in on Anais. With her lengthy rap sheet and this unproven belief that she assaulted a cop and put the woman in a coma, her time of relative freedom is coming to an end. They want to put her away in the underage facility located on an island called John Kay, until she's eighteen and then, they predict, she'll end up in the regular adult jail. But Anais has a will, and has lived through enough bad shit and survived that she's not about to let this be her end. If there's one thing she has left to call her own, she reasons, it's her soul, and that the experiment can never have.The Panopticon is a tough book to read, alright. It starts slow, not because nothing happens but because Anais' narrative voice takes a while to get the hang of (for non-Scottish readers, at least), and as it's written (correctly, with great skill) in present tense, you're launched right into her head and it's a bit like floundering in deep water, trying to get your head up and get your breath and your bearings. Anais is smart at school, when she goes, but she has a distinctly colloquial way of thinking/speaking, and in Scottish vernacular, so that her voice is strongly authentic. She's also a big drug taker, as well as an adolescent, and the way she thinks is reflective of both. It's highly realistic, and given the subject matter, this makes it a tough book to read.Yet so, so worthwhile. On Goodreads I tagged this as a \"made me cry\" book. I cried not just because of what happens to some of the characters (well, all really), but because this isn't really fiction. It's scarily real. This shit happens. There are lots and lots of kids just like Anais and Tash and Isla and Shortie and all the rest, kids who had a rough start in life and have been stuck in the system ever since, kids who got dealt a shitty hand and have been punished for it ever since, kids who have been judged by the system, labelled and shelved. The panel hearing that Anais attends is very telling of the system's unsympathetic attitude:\"It is my belief that you cannot stop yourself, Miss Hendricks. Everything in your record tells me that you will keep offending. [...] And, should you be tried for one single offense more, then we have a court order to have you placed in a secure unit and detained until you are eighteen years old, without review. [...] I will personally advocate that she graduates to the maximum-security wing in the Panopticon at the earliest possible opportunity. We have pages\"--the chairwoman brandishes a thick sheaf of papers--\"pages and pages of charges, and this isn't even half of them. [...] It is my opinion, Miss Hendricks, that you are going to re-offend. Once you have done so, you will go into a secure unit. And when you get released from there, you will offend again and you will go on to spend your adult life in prison, which is exactly where you belong, because you, Miss Hendricks, present a considerable danger both to yourself and to all of society.\" [pp.151-2]The trouble with our society (societies, in all their variance) is that they only allow for one way of being, one way of living and existing, as a way of maintaining order and the status quo. Yet a startlingly large portion of any society's population simply cannot mould itself to that one way of living, and they tend to pay a large price for resisting. Anais' friends, the adults that she knows from her time of living with Mother Teresa, are just such people - and so too is Anais. They take a lot of drugs, and paint portraits of penises, and have sex change operations, and live surrounded by stolen goods, and give vodka to children, and talk about gender and the true state of the world. It's the exact opposite of any developed, western country's idea of middle class surbabia a la 1955. It's seen as self-destructive, and dangerous, and subversive, and freakish. Anais' world isn't a pretty one, or a comfy one, or even a safe one. It's sad, but not surprising, that Anais drinks so much and takes so many drugs. And from that, perhaps, comes the hallucinations, the suspicion, the paranoia.It's just me now. Chef's in the kitchen. Eric's in the office. Everyone else is at school. The watchtower windows reflect the sun, and the big bug-eyes stare, and it's totally obvious that watchtower doesnae even need staff in it; it just watches - all on its own. [p.57]With Anais' history, it's also no surprise that she struggles with a sense of her own identity. There's a lost little girl trapped inside, and in an unguarded moment she once asks for her mummy - the one and only time she's let that wish slip free.Identity problem. Fuck that. Fifty-odd moves, three different names, born in a nuthouse to a nobody that was never seen again. Identity problem? I dinnae have an identity problem - I dinnae have an identity, just reflex reactions and a disappearing veil between this world and the next. [p.86]With as hard-shelled and wise as Anais sometimes seems, it's easy to forget that she's just fifteen, and naive, and trusts the wrong people - like her ex, Jay. She remembers how it felt, after Mother Teresa died when she was eleven, how he held her and stroked her hair. (All anyone ever wants is to be held and loved, right?) He knows how to pull her strings, but I couldn't believe how stupid she could be. You'd think that you'd be more wise to sweet-talking selfish fuckheads after a life like hers, wouldn't you?There are moments of sweetness in Anais' life that make her cling on, and yearn for something better - like the impromptu picnic on a little island in the lake, where she and Shortie and Tash and Isla talked and smoke and drank and ate junk food, and Shortie performed a wedding ceremony for Tash and Isla and Anais threw petals and gave them rings woven from grass. It is, perhaps, the happy memories that make the bad times so hard, the times of loss. Never is it more apparent just how alone and isolated these teenagers, these children, are. No one really cares. The police see them as nothing but trouble. They've seen things and experienced things that they can only share with each other, because only others like themselves understand, and never show pity.This is a richly told story, perfectly written in Anais' voice, and readers may be spared from some graphic details but you're not spared from the unpleasant truths of her life. Fagan has given real teens like Anais a voice, and an uncompromising, honest look into their lives. I felt two things distinctly, while reading this: a strong protective urge, that motherly instinct to save and protect and support; and the understanding that that kids like Anais are not the enemy, or a fucked-up element of society beyond all hope: rather, that they are fucked-up elements of our society who have made a society all of their own, different, and bleak, and dangerous, and unforgiving, but still human, and full of human feeling. This was a brave book to write, considering how gutted I felt reading it, and a worthy one. The Panopticon introduces a strong, skilful and talented writer who presents an unflinching portrait of a young girl trying to find her place in a society that doesn't want her, and more importantly, to find herself.My thanks to the publisher for a copy of this book via TLC Book Tours."}, {"userName": "Tom", "userReviewDate": "Jul 07, 2013", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/5024047-tom", "userReview": "\u201cThe Panopticon\u201d is one of the best-written, saddest, most-moving and triumphant coming-of-age novels I\u2019ve ever read\u2014easily one of the best books of 2013\u2014and I have absolutely no damned idea how to review it. I love books like that, books that are so original that they defy easy analysis. So many novels today have almost identical plots: a stranger comes to a new town; there\u2019s a meet-cute between two people who initially hate each other then grow to love each other, and work to save an imperiled city/world/bunch of puppies, all followed by a nice, sunny denouement where everyone \u201cgood\u201d is\u2014for the moment\u2014safe and happy. Same circus, different clowns. Jenni Fagan\u2019s debut novel, \u201cThe Panopticon,\u201d defies classification. It doesn\u2019t fit neatly into any genre. \u201cThe Panopticon\u201d marches steadily through one girl\u2019s hell, showing us her tough present situation, while following a trail of breadcrumbs and blood droplets through her nightmare past. \u201cThe Panopticon\u201d does not play nicely with the other books on the shelf.Anais Hendrickson is fifteen-years-old. She was born in a mental institution to a mother who disappeared almost immediately. She\u2019s been in and out of dozens of foster families and institutions, noting that the sum of her belongings always fits in three garbage bags. She smokes, drinks, does a wide variety of drugs, and has had sex for money, for love, and by force. She\u2019s grown-up hard, committing nearly innumerable crimes, from vandalism to attempted murder.All along, the one thing she\u2019s been able to cling to is \u201cthe experiments,\u201d her dead certainty that she\u2019s being watched constantly by a bunch of men with shiny shoes and no noses on their faces. Irrational? Yes, but she clings to this, because no matter where she goes, people disappear or die on her. Her biological mother was gone within hours of her birth. She found one beloved foster mother murdered in a bathtub. The alternative to \u201cthe experiments\u201d is crushing guilt that she caused their deaths.To say Anais is scarred defies overestimation. \u201cAnais Hendrickson\u201d isn\u2019t even her real name. It\u2019s the fourth name she\u2019s had, one somebody picked out for her. Anais stands accused of beating a female police officer into a coma. There isn\u2019t enough evidence to arrest her yet. The authorities are convinced she committed the crime. Anais is just as certain she didn\u2019t, though she was so wasted that she can\u2019t remember where she was that night. We meet Anais in the back of a police car, when she\u2019s being driven to The Panopticon, a semi-secure facility for troubled teens. We see her make friends and enemies, and she ultimately finds that, in a strange way, she\u2019s landed in a sort of family. She likes her social worker, Angus, who goes to bat for her. She\u2019s friends with many of her fellow \u201cguests.\u201d She\u2019s even grown to feel at home there in her small room. But her past catches up to her. The specter of the comatose police officer hangs over her head, of course, but there\u2019s more. Once again, people she loves start disappearing and dying on her. Anais isn\u2019t complicit in their deaths, but the all-pervading sense of loss, of emptiness, has tracked her down. She tries to escape into the arms of a former lover. This nearly ends tragically. Finally, she\u2019s left with no other course but the most brazen and desperate. \u201cThe Panopticon\u201d is told through Anais\u2019s eyes. We\u2019re privy to her thoughts\u2014jumbled at times\u2014and her terrible memories. We see the survival mechanisms she\u2019s put in place just to keep her going some days. Her mind is not a comfortable place to be.Author Jenni Fagan is an award-winning poet, and her powerful use of language renders Anais\u2019s life in stark, scary bursts. We follow Anais through rare warm patches and feelings of belonging, then we lurch back to disjointed bursts from her hellish past. I\u2019ve read hundreds of novels over the past few years. Some have been heartwarming, others full of adventure, some terrifying. However none of them pulled me in quite like \u201cThe Panopticon.\u201d I felt like I was watching a horrifying documentary while somebody held down the fast forward button. \u201cThe Panopticon\u201d is one hell of a ride.

At the prison she will meet other youth, just like herself. There is plenty of swearing, drug use and sex, so I can see that this book will not be for everyone. Yet Anais, whose narrative voice takes some getting used to, and her friends have a story that need to be told. So many of our youth are throwaway kids, and it is a sad state of affairs, in this country as well as others. At times the prevalent drug use serves to slow the narrative down, they are so detailed. This is a maddening book, in that some of the people involved in hers and the others cases are so unsympathetic or maybe just burned out. Maybe seeing too just much makes them less compassionate. Interesting concept for a book, and I loved the grittiness and toughness of Anais, yet she can still makes friends and despite all she has gone through, can still be compassionate. Would have rated this higher, but I had a problem with the ending. I thought too many strands of the story were left dangling, unexplained. That was frustrating, but I am still very glad to have met Anais."}, {"userName": "~\u2721~D\u03b1ni(ela) \u2665 \u2642\u2642 love & semi-colons~\u2721~", "userReviewDate": "Jun 13, 2013", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/7999417-d-ni-ela-love-semi-colons", "userReview": "I feel like I need a shower. This book was grim and dirty; reading it was a visceral experience, a rather unpleasant one. I was all set to like this book. I have a secret fondness for dialects and cussing (really, I do; cussing has its place!). But this book is essentially plotless. It's a big pile of meandering thoughts told by a drugged-up, paranoid teenager. 15-year-old Anais, in and out of group and foster homes, abused as a kid, tripping from just about every drug out there, is, by her own admission, completely fucked up. At the beginning of the novel, Anais is sent to the Panopticon, a type of reform home for young offenders. The novel is set in Scotland, and Anais narrates the story in a thick Scottish brogue that proved somewhat confusing even to me (and I'm a linguist, people! Speech is my thing). Alas, the story goes nowhere. It's part stream of consciousness, part weird pseudo-mystery, with no real climax. There's a lot of graphic descriptions of drug trips and sexual encounters. Anais has lived a terrible life, and we're privy to her thoughts and memories, which soon become just words. How much can we be shocked before we become immune?"}, {"userName": "Bonnie", "userReviewDate": "Jul 31, 2013", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/5136858-bonnie", "userReview": "\u2018The experiment are watching.You can feel them, ay. In the quiet. In the room. Wherever you are-they\u2019re there. That\u2019s a given. Sometimes they\u2019re right, sometimes a wee bit further away; when I want to hurt myself but I dinnae, I can always feel them then. They want me to hurt myself. They\u2019re sick like that. What they really want is me dead.\u2019\nAnais, 15 years old, is suspected of assaulting a police officer and while the police complete their investigation she\u2019s taken to The Panopticon for close monitoring. For being so young, Anais has led a shockingly violent life. She never met her birth mother and has been in the foster care system since she was born. Her foster mother was brutally murdered and Anais was the one to find her body. Drugs and alcohol have become par for the course with her and are the reason she can\u2019t remember if she actually did assault that police officer. All she knows is, the tower in The Panopticon watches over everyone, always. Whether that\u2019s simply a paranoid delusion or not remains to be seen.\n\u2018The watchtower windows reflect the sun, and the big bug-eyes stare, and it\u2019s totally obvious that watchtower doesnae even need staff in it; it just watches \u2013 all on its own.\u2019\nThe Panopticon is a wild ride of pure insanity. A crazy combination of A Clockwork Orange, One Flew Over the Cuckoo\u2019s Nest and Fear and Loathing in Las Vegas. Scottish style. The Scottish terms will seek to overwhelm you but Google is useful; use it. This story was shocking and heartbreaking, even more so when you find out it\u2019s loosely based on the authors own personal experiences with the foster care system in Scotland. Anais may be a juvenile delinquent but she\u2019s still got morals and that\u2019s what makes her case so heartbreaking. She\u2019s smart, full of wit and has hopes and dreams of living in Paris above a bakery where she\u2019d wake up to the smell of fresh croissants. But since she doesn\u2019t live above a bakery in Paris, she passes the time by playing the \u2018Birthday Game\u2019 where she uses her imagination to make up a different life than the one she\u2019s currently leading.Anais is a prime example of juvenile delinquency but she\u2019s not the only misfit being kept at The Panopticon. There are the girls she befriends: Isla, the HIV-positive mother of twins that cuts herself to try to rid herself of the virus and Tash, her lover who works as a prostitute in order to save up for their own flat. There are lesser sad-cases as well such as the boy who is bullied by everyone including the staff after he is caught raping a dog and another who burned down a special-needs school. Bottom line, this is not a pretty story, but despite its ugliness, it tells the honest story of young people that are beaten down by the system that is intended to keep them safe."}, {"userName": "Laima", "userReviewDate": "Apr 27, 2012", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/5032407-laima", "userReview": "The Panopticon by Jenni FaganWhen it comes to deciding which book to read next I don\u2019t follow a list nor do I try to work through a stack of books. I tend to read whatever type of novel catches my interest at the time.After browsing through a few reviews of The Panopticon on GoodReads I decided this story was intriguing, strange and quirky enough to suit my taste in books\u2026 so I ordered a copy. I\u2019m very glad I did!!This book is a debut novel for Scottish author Jenni Fagan. It is very different than any other book I\u2019ve read. Not only does the story keep your interest but the language is harsh, real and intense. There is use of Scottish dialect and terminology throughout the story \u2013 sometimes not easily understood.Fifteen year old Anais Hendricks is a chronic young offender. She does not remember what happened but has blood all over her school uniform \u2013 and a policewoman lies in a coma. She is brought to the Panopticon, \u201ca circular prison with cells so constructed that the prisoners can be observed at all times.\u201dAs the book jacket states \u201cSmart, funny and fierce, Anais is a counter-culture outlaw, a bohemian philosopher in sailor shorts and a pillbox hat. She is also a child who has been let down, or worse, by just about every adult she ever met.\u201dAnais was born in a mental institution. Her bio-mum jumped out the window after the birth and was never seen again. In her own words this is how Anais describes her life:\u201cI got taken in when I was born, moved through twenty-four placements until I was seven, got adopted, left there when I was eleven, moved another twenty-seven times in the last four years.\u201d That\u2019s that out the road. I\u2019ve said it so many times it\u2019s like reciting a wee bunch of words that dinnae mean anything. I could be reciting the ingredients for cornflakes.This story is about Anais, her relationship with the other offenders she meets at the Panopticon, her struggle with trying to remember what happened \u2013 she has difficulty with this as she is usually stoned or high. There are funny parts in this novel too. I found the boating trip taken by the inmates hilarious. No spoilers here though.Overall, I felt like rooting for Anais to do something right or at least win at something even though her life was such a mess. She is a heartbreaking young heroine and it is her character and story that create a wonderfully quirky and unique novel. I give this book a 4 star rating only because sometimes I had difficulty with the dialect."}, {"userName": "Philtrum", "userReviewDate": "Jan 08, 2013", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/12699702-philtrum", "userReview": "I finished reading this a couple of days ago but have been waiting before writing this review to see if my first impressions were going to change. They have not.The other reviews I\u2019ve read (which is why I read the book in the first place) seem to be universally glowing. The solitary one-star review on Amazon seems to be an error as the reviewer raves about the book.It has been this feeling that I\u2019m clearly out on a limb which has made me wait before committing myself. Have I really missed something? Am I just on the wrong wavelength?Pa`nop\u00b4ti`con ( noun). A circular prison with cells so constructed that the prisoners can be observed at all times. [Greek panoptos 'seen by all'] The tale begins as Anais Hendricks (15) is being taken to a care home (the titular Panopticon). She\u2019s been accused of assaulting a policewoman (who is in a coma throughout the book). The story is told only from Anais\u2019s point of view, and she is a troubled lass.Born in an asylum to a mother she never knew, she\u2019s been passed from pillar to post, from one \u201ccare\u201d environment to another. She was fostered by a prostitute who was killed. She\u2019s violent and short-tempered. She hoovers up drugs (of all kinds) like sweets. If someone offers her a pill (or three), she swallows them. She\u2019s sexually active. There are constant lesbian overtones. Her language is foul. She seems to have few redeeming qualities. She fantasises that the details of her birth were different, and that she will live, instead of her miserable, futile life in Scotland, a bohemian one in Paris.We meet several of the other children in the home, and they\u2019re all as damaged as Anais. The plot, such as it is, is fairly grim, and Anais ends up being gang-raped in a council tower block flat, with the crime, she assumes, being filmed for online distribution.Other reviewers seem to think the book is wonderfully well written and that the story is about hope and friendship. I don\u2019t think I\u2019d agree on either count.My overwhelming impression, and this has not changed over the last couple of days, is that this is nothing more than some kind of porn: of which type I\u2019m not so sure \u2013 Welfare state porn? Safeguarding porn?Anais \u2013 15 years old, remember \u2013 seems to glory in her vices. The author offers no commentary, makes no judgement. There are no effective adult characters in the book who even attempt to help Anais grow up \u2013 apart from one support worker, Angus, who tells her more than once: \u201cYou\u2019re all right, really, you are\u201d (or words to that effect).The blurb indicates the author has worked (or still works) in prisons, and one imagines she must have encountered enough kids like Anais. But the novel just seems to be saying: \u201cLook how crap it is for some of these kids, look at what they do, see how they smoke, drink, use drugs, have sex. See how they know more about the seedy underbelly of society than you readers will know in the whole of your lives. Isn\u2019t it grim? But oddly fascinating?

At the beginning of the book, she's being transferred to the Panopticon, a home for young offenders housed in an old, gothic building. This is a good read - energetic and funny - but it deviates from what the blurb and cover seem to suggest: there is much darkness to the story but the tone is light, and despite an implied sense of mystery, it's really more of a plotless portrait of the protagonist's life. It felt to me a lot like one of those YA books for older teens that always cause loads of controversy because they're full of swearing, drugs and sex (such as Junk by Melvin Burgess, which I absolutely loved when I was an actual teenager and really, really need to re-read). It is shocking in places, mainly because of what Anais has already experienced at such a young age: however, there were some aspects of her character I found a bit unbelievable, almost too good to be true (her anti-bullying attitude, the extent of her reading/cultural knowledge, her obsession with vintage style). I enjoyed The Panopticon, but I didn't find it as remarkable as many readers have, and I don't find myself with an awful lot to say about it now it's done."}, {"userName": "Stuti (Turmeric isn't your friend.

And I don't mean a casual 'fuck'.~It features many dark and fucked-up stories.~The reality isn't pretty.~Rape, prostitution, wanking, and excessive swearing constitute a whole lot of this book.This book is the ultimate troll. What with the blurb and cover and all, I expected thriller/dystopic/sci-fi novel. Something within that range. But The Panopticon deals with simple, unblemished going-on's of an orphan girl's life, and other people she comes in contact with. Anais is fucked-up beyond reason, but not actuality. Born in an asylum to a vanished mother, drifting from home to new home, addicted to 'all the bad things', she has one more problem to cope up with: the Experiment.She feels them watching her, reading her, waiting on her. They want her to break and they sure do their damnedest to make that happen. Anais has known about them since she was a kid; she knows she can't let them find that out. So along with all her trouble, she's also been living in a panopticon all this time.As Karen point out in her review, the idea of the setting of the Panopticon-style home had no point really. The stuff with the experiment and the allusion to the greek prison made sense, but the setting was never fully conceptualized.There's a whole dismal rainbow of characters, and each one grabbed a fold of my heart. These are just teenagers with problems not bigger than the world's, but individually it's so scary. The girls and boys in this book feel so human and teenager-type, they each have their coping methods and it's not all fun and games. These kids have been run over by life and adults, but you won't see them paying it any heed. There's no respite, no silver lining for anybody, you gotta swallow it straight and keep lugging, if you want to move on.The story isn't really all that there. It begins with Anais being sent to the panopticon for putting a police woman in coma, and what basically follows(and I'm telling you in unappealing terms, quite unlike this book) is her psyche getting drained. I mean, really. Besides the heartrending characters, whenever we are alone with Anais, there is paranoia, fear and desolation. Every moment hurts.But Anais is a tough character if there ever was one.I'm a bit unconvinced by reality, full stop.There are things I didn't like, particularly something major that happens to wards the end. At first, I was in a rage at the author for using such an ugly plot device to make the character round up her shit and get her act together. HOWEVER, I realized this was life being consistent in all its inconsistent, fucked-up grandeur.To say I liked this book would be incomplete, and trying to exactly pinpoint my feelings and fit in a glasscase for you is impossible.

It isn\u2019t a question of ability or intelligence; those things are, relatively speaking, easy to get a handle on. No, it\u2019s the students who possess all the necessary tools and then opt, for whatever reason, not to engage at all. To let the work go unfinished, to half-ass the paper, to fake their way through the reading rather than attempt to make sense of it.This was true when I taught high school, and, amazingly, it\u2019s still true now that I\u2019m working with preservice English teachers. These are adult students one or two years out from teaching in their own classrooms, but there are always a couple each semester who apparently decide, \u201cI know there are certain habits that all successful teachers begin to adopt during their time as students, but I\u2019m going to do things my own way.\u201d They can do the work; they just won\u2019t.The reasons are manifold. Sometimes it\u2019s boredom or the irrelevance of the material. In those cases it\u2019s on me \u2013 I have to figure out what\u2019s not working and fix it. There are also those cases of good old-fashioned laziness, and those are sort of on me, too. I remember what I was like at 16 and 21, and I have a hard time faulting students for adopting the same behaviors I had when I was their age \u2013 and which I still battle, if I\u2019m going to be completely honest.But there are other instances when the roots of student behavior are deeper and more troubling. These can often be traced back to trauma \u2013 abuse or neglect, for instance, or things as unfortunately commonplace as divorce or death \u2013 and when we\u2019re talking about teenagers, we have to remember that they\u2019re ill-equipped to deal with these things. As adults we have to be sensitive to this. We are all products of our past, and the way we act in the present is often dictated by how we\u2019ve responded to things beyond our control.So it is with Anais Hendricks, the fiercely intelligent narrator of The Panopticon, who, at 15-years-old, has racked up charges for over 100 juvenile offenses and is now being monitored at a group home for troubled youth. Most of these offenses are minor (petty theft and drug issues, mostly); some are major (vandalizing half a dozen police cars). But now Anais is under suspicion of beating a female police officer into a coma, and she\u2019s been remanded to the Panopticon until her case works its way through the courts.At the start Anais comes off like just another variation of the addicts who people Irvine Welsh\u2019s novels: she\u2019s surly and sarcastic, she\u2019s usually under the influence of something, and her language is peppered with profanity and Scottish slang. I resisted this at first because I felt like I\u2019d seen it before. But as author Jenni Fagan unspools Anais\u2019 story, we come to see there\u2019s much more going on here than we first realize. Like some of those students who resisted my best intentions to educate them, Anais at 15 is the product of a past most of us would likely never survive.She\u2019s been orphaned since birth and has bounced through 51 foster homes by the time we meet her. She\u2019s been abused, she\u2019s been a drug courier for various friends and family members, and her most fondly remembered foster mother is a murdered prostitute. We don\u2019t know exactly why she has such a destructive streak \u2013 unless we\u2019re willing to generally chalk it up to \u201cpoor childhood,\u201d which might be fair \u2013 but the Panopticon also fits into Anais\u2019 self-constructed origin story: she wasn\u2019t born so much as created in a lab, and she\u2019s under constant surveillance by something she calls only \u201cthe experiment.\u201dI was decidedly lukewarm on The Panopticon throughout its early chapters. Like I mentioned above, at first there\u2019s a little too much Welsh for comfort, and Anais initially seemed like just another in a long line of nihilistic teenage protagonists who didn\u2019t have much to bring to the table other than drug problems and a piss-poor attitude. To the author\u2019s credit, however, it becomes clear pretty quickly that she\u2019s not just rubbing our noses in the darkness of the world. Anais has a wicked sense of humor, and its her exchanges with the other characters in the Panopticon that\u2019s partially due to my turnaround. It\u2019s all bleak \u2013 Tash is a teenage prostitute; Isla is an HIV-positive cutter who gave the disease to her twins \u2013 but there\u2019s a pseudo-philosophical gallows humor that cuts through material that could be tediously morose in other hands. Take this reflection on our origins:Maybe God\u2019s just a scientist. This is all an experiment gone wrong, every single one of us, just wonky as fuck because of some chemical cock-up that was meant to produce something less faulty.The other thing working in the book\u2019s favor is how sensitively Fagan paints Anais\u2019 inner life. Despite her (self) destructive tendencies, she lives by a strict moral code \u2013 no bullying, no hurting animals, respecting children and the elderly \u2013 and she struggles mightily with her regular realization that most of the adults she encounters live intellectually and emotionally bankrupt lives. For me, the key passage comes in a hearing to determine how she should be punished for charges she received before falling under suspicion of beating the police officer. The court officer \u2013 condescending and imperious \u2013 asks Anais if she has anything to say before being sentenced. She doesn\u2019t respond, but this is her internal monologue:Aye. Aye, I do. It\u2019s this: here is what you don\u2019t know \u2013 I\u2019d lie down and die for someone I loved; I\u2019d fuck up anyone who abused a kid, or messed with an old person. Sometimes I deal, or I trash things, or I get in fights, but I am honest as fuck and you\u2019ll never understand that. I\u2019ve read books you\u2019ll never look at, danced to music you couldnae appreciate, and I\u2019ve more class, guts and soul in my wee finger than you will ever, ever have in your entire, miserable fucking life.Taken in the context of the way I started this review, it should be clear why I find Anais such a relatable, heartbreaking character. Adults too often jump to conclusions about teenagers. This is true of teachers, too; I worked with them and wasn\u2019t immune to such judgments myself. We evaluate them based on the standards we set for them, assuming all along those standards are worth meeting. But how often do we really stop to find out why they act as they do, or to try and learn more about their rich inner lives? We think they\u2019re lazy, they\u2019re mean, they don\u2019t care.Sometimes they are and they don\u2019t. But I\u2019ve been involved in education long enough to realize this is dangerous thinking. It\u2019s dismissive, and it too often ignores the very real hurt at the core of their behavior. Even though The Panopticon is obviously fiction, Anais is such a vividly drawn character that I see her in many of the students I\u2019ve taught over the years, and it makes me wish I\u2019d tried harder to reach those I too casually wrote off.In the end, The Panopticon can\u2019t quite deliver on all its promises. Plot threads go unresolved and conflicts are dropped in aid of a (non)resolution that is certainly hopeful but strikes me as a little too clich\u00e9d. But if I\u2019m at all dissatisfied with the way Fagan ends things, it\u2019s only because I was so enthralled with the rest of it. It\u2019s a first-rate story, true, but there are important lessons here for those willing to heed them.More reviews at goldstarforrobotboy.net"}, {"userName": "Gary Schroeder", "userReviewDate": "Jul 24, 2013", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/5937839-gary-schroeder", "userReview": "Our protagonist 15-year old orphan Anais Hendricks is in a home for wayward Scottish children which just happens to be housed in an old complex called the Panopticon ( a facility designed in such a way that all occupants can be viewed at all times from a central tower). Anais is, we are told at many turns throughout the book, something special. She's NOT just an abused, drug addled, promiscuous, violence-prone anti-heroine...no, she's \"got that Special Somethin'!\" She's a violent offender with a heart! Sure, she's in a perpetual state of being stoned throughout the novel, but she's got pluck! I'm sure that author Jenni Fagin wanted me to see Anais that way but it didn't work for this reader. The Panopticon follows Anais through a few weeks of her life in the facility where, presumably, she's simply killing time until she's likely to be transferred to an adult prison for permanent housing when she turns eighteen. Her record of violence would suggest that conclusion to almost any external observer. While in the Panopticon, she meets a series of abused, unwanted teens much like herself. life's rejects who never had a chance to make anything of themselves because they never had a proper start. It's a pity and we feel bad for them...as we're supposed to.Unfortunately, I found the book to be rather a slog. Anais is written with a strong voice and she's well drawn, but I never cared about her all that much. The plot is heavily dialogue-driven but often quite slow, consisting largely of Anais' acid-induced hallucinations, hyper-profane internal monologue (this book has far and away the highest profanity quotient of any book I've ever encountered) and conversations with her peers housed in the Panopticon. Unfortunately, the conversations that the orphans in the Panopticon have are often no more interesting than the conversations that any teens have. Yes, there are breaks in between discussions of where the next batch of drugs can be scored that are meant to show the inner scarred-but-loving-hearts of the characters, but not nearly enough to make up for the drag of most of the dialogue. While Anais is given a strong voice, her character is a bit implausible. She's been tossed from one foster home to the next, routinely getting high since she was a pre-teen but somehow possesses the soul of a wizened philosopher. These things don't seem to mesh; it's too incongruent with her neglectful, hedonistic childhood.

For most - like Isla and Tash - the story is very different.Additionally, while children often seem very resilient to trauma, the effects are often unseen or simply not recognised as such until later, so any future life Anais makes for herself will probably be tainted by her past.

The rest of the story goes through Anais\u2019s time in the Panopticon and the life circumstances/choices that have ultimately led to her being placed there. The subject matter doesn\u2019t make for easy reading\u2013The Panopticon is gritty and sometimes heartbreaking, it contains a bit of strong language, sex, and violence. But it\u2019s real life for a lot of people, and Fagan writes it in a way that doesn\u2019t make it preachy or overwhelming. The Panopticon also contains humor (though of a dark nature), friendship, love, and a kind of redemption or hope.Anais has a Scottish voice, complete with just the right amount of Scottish slang. The narration is probably my favorite part of the book; Anais\u2019s voice is wonderful. She\u2019s an authentic teenager who has been through a whole lot of shit and it shows.

The Panopticon reminds us that people like Anais exist and we\u2019re doing them a huge disservice by pretending they\u2019re invisible or ignoring them or treating them like their lives are a foregone conclusion.

I'm going to update this review later with my favourite quotes because I've marked nearly 30 passages, and they just beg to be shared."}, {"userName": "Victoria", "userReviewDate": "Jul 31, 2013", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/3049657-victoria", "userReview": "This is certainly an interesting novel - though a bit difficult to classify. The age of the narrator - just fifteen - makes it seem like it could fall into the YA genre. But after a few pages of cursing, extreme drug use, sex and violence, it is a bit too adult to safely be shelved there. Its premise - of a young woman covered in blood remanded into a more secure care home after allegedly assaulting a police officer into a coma - makes it seem like it could be a mystery. And though many mysteries are raised, there is no solution to any of them - so a mystery reader would surely be disappointed. I suppose the closest classification would be a coming-of-age novel, but, truly - Anais\u2019s story doesn\u2019t completely fit that sub-genre, either. Still, it\u2019s an interesting novel.The Scottish setting and dialect gives a fresh angle to what is essentially a story encountered before - that of a young woman struggling within the social services system. Anais\u2019s voice may give some readers pause - there is a lot of slang present. Personally, I am thankful my obsession last month with Stuart MacBride\u2019s novels - it made it quite easy to slip into the prose. And I would imagine that an audio version of the novel would be a real treat to listen to! The drug use so prevalent throughout the novel bogs it down a bit in places - just as Anais uses to soften the harshness of her world, the reader, too, is swept into some pretty trippy places. This does slow the pacing down a bit. The ending leaves a bit to be desired - a few too many questions go unaddressed. But, overall, it is an impressive novel. Fagan balances the harsh reality with some lovely scenes and Anais\u2019s turns-of-phrase are genuinely entertaining. I especially love the way she describes herself (\u201cI\u2019m just a girl with a shark\u2019s heart.\u201d). Fagan makes her characters sympathetic and never overly pathetic."}, {"userName": "Amy", "userReviewDate": "Aug 03, 2013", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/727334-amy", "userReview": "This is another book that the premise sounds RIGHT up my alley - foster care, social work, coming of age, etc. All of those are things that I tend to gravitate to for so many reasons. Although I was never bored while reading this one, I also never really found myself to be truly engaged in the novel. I was certainly disturbed by the content (it's definitely dark) and felt an overwhelming sense of sadness at the injustice so prevalent in this novel. But, I didn't find myself compelled by it. I just never connected with it for some reason. The characters were definitely well written and striking. I found the characterization to be the most outstanding aspect of the novel and that is likely what kept me reading. I didn't love the plot - and found a number of holes in it that I had a hard time overlooking. There were aspects of the plot that were alluded to but never really given any substance which I think was a bit of a letdown. Jenni Fagan is obviously a good writer. There were several scenes that came so alive to me that they made me a bit sick to my stomach due to the intensity of the events being described. She certainly has a way with language and in describing events. Although I was initially taken aback by the dialect of the novel, I got used to that over time. All in all, this novel didn't wow me as I'd hoped but it has outstanding characterization and says something pretty important about social injustice and child welfare. But, be warned ... this is a very dark novel. One that has quite a bit of dark and twisty content which might not work if you're weary of such things. ** NOTE: This book was provided to me by the publisher for review."}, {"userName": "Matt", "userReviewDate": "Oct 11, 2013", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/556887-matt", "userReview": "A really satisfying and strange book about a troubled teen girl, Anais, as she tries to get a hold of her life while staying at a kind of at-risk facility, the Panopticon of the title. I have to say, it's the most positive emobidment of the panopticon project I think I've ever heard of, since the facility is mostly staffed by warm and caring people.Part of what made this book really work for me was the willingness of Fagan to really commit to the voice. It took me a couple chapters to get used to the Scottish dialect, and then on top of that, our narrator is high and hallucinating a lot of the time, and then there's slang dripping over the whole thing, so it's the kind of book that definitely requires your attention to read (unless, maybe, you like in Scotland?). But I liked it, even though at the end I was still a little puzzled about some parts of the story-- what exactly is the birthday game, and why are the Experiment still around at the end of the book? What about the monk and his drawing of the cat with wings? Didn't that precede Anais' visit to see the old man at the madhouse? Or did I lose some crucial piece in there?But in the rush of imagery and undiluted experience, I didn't care too much about needing to position every piece of the narrative. People for fifty years have been looking for the new Holden Caulfield; I think this is the first book I've read that comes close to that, in terms of the honesty of the voice and the reflection of what it feels like to be that age."}, {"userName": "LeeAnn Heringer", "userReviewDate": "Aug 06, 2013", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/3013237-leeann-heringer", "userReview": "*Sigh* Another book pushed at me and pushed at me and pushed at me and, well, I just didn't get it. The protagonist is a young girl, drug addicted, been through the child services grind, found her adopted prostitute mother murdered in the bath, may or may not have put a policewoman in a coma. So, I didn't like the girl and there's not much of a plot, just her walking in circles randomly reacting to things that may or may not be there. And child services in Scotland must be pretty bad if girls in a group home as allowed to wander off at night and work as prostitutes or shag the local farmers or not attend school for months. It strained my sense of disbelief that you would have this watch tower to look inside the rooms of the children and yet they could wander around and off the property without anyone asking where they were going. What's the point of a watch tower if you're doing such a piss poor job of keeping track of them the other 16 hours of the day?The ending / last chapter did redeem the story a little. I would sum up the book by saying that it's a story about how we tell a lot of stories about ourselves, try on a number of alternate skins, and one day, if you're lucky, all the story lines snap together and this is what you are. You finally recognize yourself in the mirror and that's where the story really begins."}, {"userName": "Bandit", "userReviewDate": "Jul 14, 2014", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/4528663-bandit", "userReview": "Judging by the reviews, accolades and praise this should have been something excellent, at least something special. And it really wasn't. To describe this book succinctly would be that it was difficult to read. In every sense. It's written in Scottish, you know that heavy Scottish brogue that sounds oh so charming, but you're not quite sure what's being uttered at all times...this is written like that. Took a while to get used to. Then there is the plot itself, a story of a 15 year old girl, who's been in the system her entire life, and eventually ends up in Panopticon, an institution for troubled youth. And, as expected from such a life, the main protagonist is tough, sad, confused, overly sexualized (to the point that it's awkward to read about, all that teenage wanking or is it wanking off and sex) and possibly violent. There is a varied cast of juvenile delinquents and otherwise living in Panopticon. Is it all a part of some social experiment? It might be, it was just really difficult to engage with this book long enough to care. Just wasn't an enjoyable reading experience. The ending was a pleasant surprise, considering the general mood of the book, and it came soon enough this being a very quick read, but that's about it really."}, {"userName": "Lilla Smee", "userReviewDate": "Jan 09, 2014", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/2869530-lilla-smee", "userReview": "It's like ... Trainspotting starring a drug-addled, [too-]precocious 15 year old crossed with ... Judy Blume? It's relentless. Intense. Witty and charming (for all its bleak horror). You'll feel like a dirty voyeur, trapped in the brain of seriously fucked-up Anais. I did.The unreliability of the first-person narrator--is she experiencing a flashback? indulging in pure fantasy? experiencing symptoms of mental illness?--was interesting at first, but ultimately pointless. Refreshing, though, are Anais' little life philosophies and observations (sometimes far too canny for a 15 year old).I'm suspicious of silence, and reality, and social workers. I'm suspicious of teachers, and police, and psychologists, and clowns, and apples, and red meat, and cows. Cows are too big and they're telepathic. You walk past a cow field and they all just turn as one being and stare.And she has principles. On violence, for example: \"I can be a cunt, but I dinnae batter someone unless they go for me first, and I'd never, ever pick on a kid, or an animal, or some old person.\" And police she only picks on if they ask for it."}, {"userName": "Gabi Coatsworth", "userReviewDate": "Jul 24, 2013", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/5890137-gabi-coatsworth", "userReview": "This book is all about the voice. That's what makes it great, and what might also make it very difficult to read for American readers.The character of the young female protagonist, who's trying to find and keep her own identity during a life of deprivation, abuse and foster homes, is a mix of feisty, amoral, and loyal. I was on her side form the get go. The Panopticon of the title is a care home where all the rooms are visible from a central core. When I began reading, I thought this was a dystopian novel, but it's contemporary, and all the more involving for that. If you think you might not manage the language of the book, try and find it on tape. I wouldn't mind betting that that will make it all clear. I remember reading Huckleberry Finn as a young English girl and being mystified and put off by the way the character talked. I imagine non British readers might feel the same.

Considered a secure home for teenage offenders, the Panopticon is a prison to its young residents; a circular building observed by an unknown audience in a watchtower, the rooms with doors that can be closed \u2013 and locked \u2013 by only the staff. At the time of her transfer, Anais has been apprehended by police, found with blood on her skirt while a policewoman lies in a coma. An orphan since her birth, Anais has been moved from home to home with such frequency that she disbelieves a true family ever existed for her; she is an experiment, she tells the reader, created only for the purpose of being observed by people she cannot see \u2013 people from whom she is convinced she\u2019ll never escape. As Anais adjusts to the suffocating world inside the Panopticon and grows to know her fellow residents, she\u2019s driven to plan for herself what adults have never been able to provide her with: freedom, and a life of her own. What results is a story, at once heartbreaking and inspiring, that weaves through the dreams and horrors of adolescence in the voice of a fearless young woman determined to come to terms with her own worth.The Panopticon was one of the most shocking and relevant books I\u2019ve read in a while. Author Jenni Fagan shrouds a very present-day setting with an aura of dystopia, leaving us with a world that feels staggeringly, almost disturbingly true to life. Some elements of the novel take wing on the illusory, such as Anais\u2019s determined concept of an experiment watching her. Even the bizarre world of the Panopticon has an air of invention, where children are convicted offenders but attend public schools, have cell phones, and are given clothing allowances. But the figments of The Panopticon are far, very far outweighed by the alarming realities a teenager raised on the streets could face: drug use, prostitution, suicide, murder. Though it\u2019s draped in elements of the surreal, the world of The Panopticon, the struggles of its characters and the narrative\u2019s dark wit, cut through to the reader in a way that feels deeply personal, and quite scary. It\u2019s amid this beautifully-crafted and harrowing tumult that we find the one unwavering source of optimism: the heroine, fifteen year-old Anais.Anais Hendricks struck me as women\u2019s answer to Holden Caufield. With a penchant for vintage cloths and the starry-eyed dreams of a life in Paris, what makes Anais so unlike the heroines who\u2019ve come before her is the journey that\u2019s lead her to where she is. Despite a life so lacking in familial love that she has actually convinced herself of being spawned in a petri dish, Anais maintains a witty and ultimately positive outlook on life even as she scrambles against the fear of permanent confinement. I can\u2019t remember the last time \u2013 if ever \u2013 I came across such a courageous heroine. She\u2019s by no means meek, armed with an arsenal of profanities and a fierceness of spirit that challenges her superiors. What she\u2019s seen and done will shock the reader, but what she says and how she thinks will stay with them for much longer. It\u2019s amazing that, all the while she\u2019s on this journey of loneliness, looking for a place where she can be home, Anais has been at home in her reader\u2019s heart all along.Fagan\u2019s writing style is quite fascinating, and beautifully executed. The narrative \u2013 which, as well as the subject matter, is not for the modest \u2013 is told in Anais\u2019s own voice, complete with the Scottish accent that she and those around her possess. The style could be challenging for some, but it\u2019s incredibly well achieved and the personal touch that it adds to the novel is irreplaceable. This is the sort of novel that defines how subjective literature can be; some will love it and some, much like with Salinger\u2019s The Catcher in the Rye, will not see its merits. As for my opinion, I think The Panopticon is a startling and brilliant work from an outstanding new talent in the literary world.(Review \u00a9 Casee Marie, originally published on August 13, 2013 at LiteraryInklings.com.
