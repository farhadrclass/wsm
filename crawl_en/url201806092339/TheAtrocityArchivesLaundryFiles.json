I was out for drinks last Friday and someone made some kind of joke about renaming a lesbian club \"Aphrodite\" and I responded that that doesn't make sense, it should be called \"Artemis\" or at least \"Athena\", some goddess who isn't so connected to the male gaze and men in general etc. then I proceeded to describe what each of those goddesses oversees, their hallmarks, and their various equivalents across other mythologies. sadly, I soon noticed glazed looks and averted eyerolls from the guys & gals around the table. being quite familiar with those sorts of looks, I quickly apologized about going off into nerd-land so I could avoid an onslaught of mockery. I guess my apology must have been pleasing because they responded with a chorus of comments along the lines of \"Oh but we love our nerdy little mark\" or some such attempt to lift my nerd spirits. sigh. I really should find nerdier friends.the next day, thinking on that, I realized what kind of nerd I specifically am. I like the ancient world, and powers, and god-like beings, and strange cultures and forgotten civilizations. et cetera. magic and comics and mythology and that sort of stuff. I'm not a numbers or tech nerd and I'm definitely not a science nerd. I love science fiction, but I love it for its take on social and societal issues and I love it when it is all about the opera in space opera, rather than explaining in precise detail what \"space\" is.so The Atrocity Archives is definitely for nerds, but not this kind of nerd, not me, no way. every frickin' scientific theory or paranormal doodad is explained in intense detail over the course of long paragraphs punctuated by exclamation points that seem excited about things I barely understand and certainly don't care about. this book was a chore to read and I skimmed through so much technobabble. ugh, I hate when I skim through a book because that's like forcing myself to read. the one thing in its favor was that I was amused by the breezy, casual tone of the narrative and the narrator's voice - it reminded me of the very few urban fantasy novels I've read. but besides that, the book was a bore to me.this was a 1-star book for me but I'm not giving it that because it wasn't a bad book. I didn't like it but it's hard for me to blame the book for the two of us not being a good fit. I'm sure it's perfect for the right kind of nerd."}, {"userName": "Carol.

I like his blogs, I like his personality and honesty (in so far as one can gauge such things based on the author's writings, interviews and such). The only snag is I am somewhat ambivalent about his fiction. I don't doubt that he is a talented writer of science fiction. He comes up with some great ideas and is quite popular within his chosen genre. Unfortunately from the three books I have read so far there is something about his fiction writing style that does not appeal to me. His prose style comes across as cocky, hip and chaotic. He often switches to infodump mode in the middle of his narrative, filling them with scientific terms, jargons, geekspeak, neologisms and general techno-babble. I often find it hard to distinguish the real and the imagined terms among them. Generally I find that his writing is lacking in clarity, often veering between flippant and technical and back, and this plays hell with his narrative. Yes, I imagine a lot of people find his writing clear as a bell, I can only speak for myself.From the synopsis The Atrocity Archives should have been more fun than it turned out to be. Basically this is a spy thriller-sci-fi-supernatural horror hybrid, sort of a cross between le Carr\u00e9 spy fiction, The X-Files and Cthulhu Mythos. It is centered on a super secret British spy organization called The Laundry that \"clean up\" and protect the country from ghastly supernatural incursions from other dimensions. The edition of the book that I read contain two distinct stories the original short novel \"The Atrocity Archives\" and the novella \"The Concrete Jungle\", the later is more entertaining and tightly written than the former. There are multiple instances of excessive exposition in this book (TMI!), some of these infodumps are more interesting and comprehensible than others. Although the book is a mashup of several genres it reads more like sci-fi than anything else, all the supernatural elements have a scientific or pseudo-scientific basis. I like his little infodump about plutonium and nuclear bombs, learning something from fiction is always a bonus. His witticisms and sense of humour provide the element of levity I expected but this is less prominent than I thought it would be. I love the fun twist on the \"You can't make an omelette without breaking eggs\" idiom, and the satire of bureaucratic red tape in an office.\n\"In the Laundry we supposedly pride ourselves on our procedures. We\u2019ve got procedures for breaking and entering offices, procedures for reporting a shortage of paper clips, procedures for summoning demons from the vasty deeps, and procedures for writing procedures. We may actually be on track to be the world\u2019s first ISO-9000 total-quality-certified intelligence agency.\"\nThat stuff is gold! Extra points also for a Monty Python reference elsewhere in the book. For some reason the book is written in first person present tense, I imagine this is supposed to make the story seems more immediate and unpredictable, it does no harm I guess but does not really enhance the story for me. Characterization is on the flat side as the protagonist/narrator spends more time explaining technical details than expressing his feelings, some of the other characters are interesting but basically they are just there to move the plot along.Previously I have read Stross' famous Accelerando which required two attempts, I could not follow much of the tech and became annoyed with it (and myself), then I read Singularity Sky which I quite enjoyed and found the prose to be more readable, sometime after that I read his  Glasshouse which is brilliant and very readable, vastly superior to his other books that I have read so far.I rate The Atrocity Archives 3.5 stars (4 stars for \"The Concrete Jungle\" novella)."}, {"userName": "Lyn", "userReviewDate": "Sep 04, 2015", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/5253785-lyn", "userReview": "Charles Stross\u2019 2004 publication The Atrocity Archives introduces readers to his Laundry Files and protagonist Bob Howard.Taking inspiration from HP Lovecraft and Robert A. Howard (too much of a coincidence that his hero is named Bob Howard) Stross describes an urban fantasy world building where \u201cThe Laundry\u201d is an ultra-secret British agency that deals with the paranormal and occult, kind of a British Men in Black.Stross\u2019 science and mathematics appear to be solid and he artfully mixes in concepts of extra-dimensional wizardry with physical science and technology. Howard, a non-Company man amidst an overly rigid bureaucratic system (kind of a running joke throughout the narrative) gets involved with a supernatural plot involving dimensionally trapped Nazis.Inventive and often funny, Stross has a great idea and, though his delivery is sometimes stilted and overly complicated, he has crafted an entertaining concept."}, {"userName": "Bradley", "userReviewDate": "Mar 25, 2013", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/4213258-bradley", "userReview": "Update 1/17/18This is the third read and since I keep getting more excited every time I read it, I'm breaking down and just plopping a big extra star on for sheer enjoyment.I've decided this book is not only Spy Fiction with a Cthulhu twist with lots of super geeky math moments, but it's also Physics Porn. I've decided that I am exactly the right audience for this book. Or maybe I've become exactly the right audience. I want more. More. More. More. More. More. More.I chuckle throughout the whole damn novel, and when I start realizing that I actually understand the physics porn, I get this huge giddy feeling. But that's not all this is. Not by a long shot. It's a fight with the damn administration. It's feeling stuck and deciding to follow your instinct to make the best out of things by doing the right thing. Even if it's becoming an active operative in a nightmare scenario. :)This book, this series, is one of the biggest reasons why Charley Stross is one of my absolute favorite authors of all time. He's wicked smart, funny, and geeky to hell. :)I can't recommend this enough. :)Original Review:This is the second time I'll be reading the Laundry Files to get to the new stuff I haven't. It has so many great aspects that bring those big smiles on my face, namely: Cthulhu hacking spy comedy. The first time I read it, I didn't realize these novels were all based individually on the style of different spy fiction authors, which will end soon and be based solely upon Charles Stross's style. It is an easy and fun read and tickles all my genre bones, so it, therefore, qualifies in some of very top lists for must-reads. That isn't to say the novel doesn't have it's dry spots, either in the admittedly authentic sounding military jargon or the specialized mathematical humor that may or may not be lost upon many readers; even so, the voice never falters and the humorous parts are definitely humorous. I will admit that I am a fanboy of his works and will always be skewed in his favor. Guilty pleasures, and all that."}, {"userName": "J.L.

I liked the humor inherent in a bureaucracy battling demons and forestalling the coming apocalypse (while making sure timesheets are filled out properly). It felt a little less light-hearted when Nazis and the occult were woven into the plot. Even if this strengthened the plot, I enjoyed it a little less because what I like about The Atrocity Archives wasn't tied to the plot. 3.5 stars."}, {"userName": "Belarius", "userReviewDate": "Jan 26, 2008", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/837414-belarius", "userReview": "Every so often I come across a book so laden with obscure references that only my own particular predisposition to trivia sees me through to the other side. Charles Stross has accomplished just such a feat with The Atrocity Archives, a bewildering, fascinating, and very funny look inside the bureaucratic world of top-secret British occult espionage.If I had to capture the tone of the Atrocity Archives in one sentence, I'd describe it as three parts Men In Black, two parts The Office, and two parts of the \"Lovecraft Mythos.\" The stories (as the book is actually comprised of two separate narratives) center on The Laundry, the ultra-secret branch of Her Majesty's Government responsible for keeping the Things Beyond Our Reality from invading and destroying the world. The comedy of the book draws heavily from the juxtaposition of supernatural horrors (from Nazi occult torture engines to bodysnatching dimensional travelers) with the mind-numbing dreariness of government office politics (from paper clip audits to matrix management).The brilliance of Stross' world is also the thing most likely to confound the average reader: the book's reliance on a tightly-woven tapestry of fairly obscure esoterica. The reader has half a chance of being on top of the constant references if they (a) have read the complete works of H.P. Lovecraft, (b) have also read the complete works of Lei Deighton, (c) have taken at least one upper-level computer science course, (d) have a broad familiarity with mythological creatures from a half-dozen cultures or more, (e) have read A Brief History Of Time once or twice, (f) know their way around the lexicon of a Crowley-style occultist, (g) know twentieth-century European history fairly well, and (h) watched the Saturday morning cartoons of the mid-90s. But even that might not be enough.Like Men in Black, The Atrocity Archives is an action comedy at heart, so knowing the background of every little tidbit being thrown the reader's way isn't necessary. The books does a good job of holding the reader's hand while explaining the basics of modern magic (which turns out to be a mix of applied mathematics and physics) and the alternate history surrounding the occult cold war currently raging. But the references come so fast and furious that I honestly don't know how this books would look to the uninitiated. Which is a shame, because (knowing what I know) the story is consistently engaging and often hilarious.I enjoyed Stross' world quite a bit, and I can firmly recommend it to anyone who would also enjoy it. The only trouble is that, as richly borrowed as that world is, I'm not exactly sure who, precisely, to recommend it to."}, {"userName": "Megan Baxter", "userReviewDate": "Oct 08, 2013", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/5742086-megan-baxter", "userReview": "Dudes, I finally did it!

On the plus side it gave me the chance to sit in the sun drinking coffee and finish reading this great book.I'd always thought Stross would be a difficult read, hence the lateness in coming to the guy, but this was a highly enjoyable introduction to him. In his afterword he references Tim Powers as having previously written a book that plays with similar ideas but there's something about the concept that makes me think of Jim Butcher. A guy who works in a government office that deals with supernatural happenings wants to get out in to the field and do some wetwork manages to save the day by the end. It's the first in a series of books and one that I will happily continue to read now I've dipped my wick so to speak.Stross is known for his attention to detail in the science fiction field and even here in this light hearted fantastical novel that is plain to see. He ladels on the humour in a completely deadpan manner that fellow Brit Ben Aaronovitch could only dream of doing in his similar sounding series, and his world building is done so well that you hardly notice it happening yet by the end of the novel you are ready for more from The Laundry.Structure wise, this book contains two stories, one slightly longer than the other, and this only serves to enhance the similarity to The Night Watch which also came a few years before this was published.I can pick no faults other than the first story was a little short and the second story not necessary. If you haven't given this series or author a go yet you can't really go wrong with the first book in The Laundry Files."}, {"userName": "Trish", "userReviewDate": "Jan 17, 2018", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/3461034-trish", "userReview": "This was fun!The Atrocity Archives is the first in Charles Stross' The Laundry Files books. The Atrocity Archives is an actual archive in Amsterdam where occult and bizarre objects are kept. And Laundry is the name of a super top secret organization in Her Majesty's government charged with stopping stupid people from accidentally inviting god-like creatures into our realm and thus destroying Earth.The first thing I noticed about this book was the author's style. The MC is a guy working for \"IT\" in Laundry but, naturally, that doesn't mean the usual computing stuff. We're talking interdimensional portals and such. Nevertheless, it is a rather boring job so he volunteers for \"field work\". The guy is a nerd and I really liked how authentic the author made the dialogue - there is no euphemism or peeping when he swears, he describes even yucky daily routines or gory details and it's great.Even greater is the author's sense of humour. He doesn't go slapstick, he's not laying it on too thick, but there is the unterlying dry British humour when he speaks about interdepartmental rivalries, bureaucratic warfare about supposedly unnecessary expenses during a world-saving operation and such.Apart from the MC and his weird work space, we're also introduced to Mo O'Brien, who was just as delightful as Pinky and Brains or Bob's later boss (I really like him). You have other dimensions, the leftovers from the SS's experiments, frost giants, some Middle Eastern fanatics ... but it's really about how the administration can ruin your day when you only come into work at 10am after pulling another all-nighter. Or the debrief after the annoyingly stupid accountant meets an untimely end. Or simply: Monday.

Don\u2019t think James Bond but rather an \u2018IT guy\u2019 working for Men in Black / X Files but with a lot more geekery, maths, and mind-numbing bureaucracy, in triplicates, where computers can summon Lovecraftian demons! Somehow, Bob keeps being thrown into minor investigations that quickly turn major, spiral out of control and endanger the very fabric of the world! There is a lot of stumbling around, tons of computer jokes, plenty of paperwork and red tape, but also courage and determination. It is fun however even if the cast is mostly stereotyped (with a few entertaining idiosyncrasies) and the plot on the thin side.

Una novela que se nota al principio ciertos aires de su serializaci\u00f3n en entregas, pero que cierra perfectamente su historia y deja con ganas de m\u00e1s, mucho m\u00e1s.

I know if you've read some reviews, that may come as an astonishment because there have been books where my brain could NOT turn off, and I picked out all the problems and questions I had. This book, on the other hand, just made my brain turn off and switch to the comics that my coworker gave me - at least I was making progress through them.And in a nutshell: That's all, folks. The book was boring, full of technobabble, and there were a grand total of three women, one who was a nutjob and somewhat abusive, the other a harpy b!tch boss, and the last the one Bob wanted to nail.

He does double duty as a systems administrator and a field agent specializing in thaumaturgy (that's magic to you guys). In either capacity he's very capable and he has an uncanny ability to attract trouble. This book contains two novels. In the first, the title novel, Bob is sent to California to extract a U.K. citizen who can't leave the U.S. for some reason. He's quite happy to get away from his roommates, Pinky and Brains, two genius slobs who do weird science experiments in his apartment and leave dirty dishes in the sink. He has no idea that the person he is sent to Santa Cruz to rescue, \"Mo\" (a.k.a. Dr. Dominique O'Brien) is a gorgeous red headed Scot and a very brainy professor in some quasi-mathematical/philosophical specialty. Mo doesn't know that her research is wanted by the bad guys, and her being in the wrong place at the wrong time doesn't help.Suffice it to say that after a thwarted kidnapping and an unpleasant encounter with a reptilian creature that invades her apartment, Mo ends up being sucked through an interdimensional gate to very cold planet in an alternate universe and it's up to Bob and his team mates to get her home safely (and possibly save London too). The resourceful Bob, armed with a \"hand of glory\" and a Palm Pilot, saves the day.The \"Atrocity Archives\" of the title refer to a secret trove of Nazi war memorabilia locked in an Amsterdam cellar under the Rijksmuseum. The Nazis played with algemancy (pain magic) and that, it turns out, has something to do with the trouble Mo ends up in.Part of the fun has to do with Stross's loathing for bureaucrats, for which I don't blame him. Bob splits his time between two sets of bosses---James Angleton (also the name of a former CIA chief in the U.S.), who's in charge of field ops, and aside from an occasional lecture, and a fondness for shrunken heads on his desk, isn't too bad; and Harriet and Bridget, a couple of loathsome, petty, nasty, hairsplitters, who only care about forms, time reporting, etc., and with whom Bob is perpetually in trouble (usually because he's late coming into the office because he's been out on a classified mission). Suffice it to say that they get what's coming to them.In the second novel, \"The Concrete Jungle\", Bob gets involved in a strange case involving Gorgons, networked CCTV cameras, a dead cow, and nasty office politics. Actually he is called out to investigate a Code Blue at 4 am, and then gets dressed down by Harriet for coming into the office late.Things escalate. A detective inspector, Josephine, is enlisted to help. Or rather she is placed under a geas (i.e., coerced to keep silent) and dragged in to help against her will. Zombies make an appearance.Let's just say that Bridget and Harriet REALLY get what's coming to them in this story. Gideon Emery does a wonderful job reading the audio."}, {"userName": "David", "userReviewDate": "Mar 03, 2015", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/3335664-david", "userReview": "Bob is a hacker who accidentally came to the attention of a super-super-no-for-real-secret British agency known as the Laundry, and was recruited into an intelligence agency that literally makes you sign your oath of secrecy in blood. The Laundry is dedicated to saving the world one day at a time from eldritch horrors who threaten to blot out the sun, and also to maintaining Total Quality Management and keeping Parliament from cutting back on their office supply budget. In other words, it's meant to be wacky Call of Cthulhu adventures as undertaken by Chuck. No sooner does he get back from a mission to Pluto to stop undead Nazis from summoning a Great Old One than Bob has to explain to his bureaucratic tyrant of supervisor why he didn't file a request for comp time when he didn't show up the next day during core office hours.I liked this book better than Stross's space operas, though it did not have quite the genius of Accelerando. But it's a sort of weak Stephenson, the satire more reminiscent of Dilbert and User Friendly comic strips than the biting inventiveness that marks really good satire. I found it funny because I got a lot of the jokes which many readers will not, as they lean heavily into fairly esoteric computer science references, plus being an (ahem) civil servant myself, I know a bit about the spook shops that Stross is satirizing.I don't think you need to be a CS geek or a federal employee to enjoy The Atrocity Archives. You do need to have some appreciation for British humor and Lovecraft, though. I enjoyed Stross's sharp skewering of government work (and yeah, I can totally believe that even a super-secret super-elite agency that literally saves the world on a routine basis still would not be exempted from bureaucratic and regulatory idiocy), but Bob himself was the sort of gormless Everyman character so popular in British urban fantasy (think Neil Gaiman) and on TV, who manages to execute very clever tricks to save the day and somehow manages to wind up with girls several orders of magnitude out of his league, and seems to be a wish fulfillment character for his nerd audience.Fun, light, somewhat clever, would read more Laundry novels, but it's the kind of clever that can get old quickly if the author gives in to the tendency to let cleverness substitute for plotting and character development."}, {"userName": "Mike (the Paladin)", "userReviewDate": "Jul 14, 2010", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/2187043-mike-the-paladin", "userReview": "*This is an audio Ebook by the way. It's what I had access to through the library, but then I like audio books as well as text, at least for some fiction.*I'd never heard of these... they ended up on my \"to be read list\" because someone \"here\" had read them. I keep adding books faster than I can read them. (Thank you Stephen).This is actually Atrocity Archives and The Concrete Jungle in one \"volume\" (are Ebooks volumes?).I don't know if I can accurately describe these/this books/book. The influence of H.P.Lovecraft is obvious, but that could be misleading. In a world where it's been discovered that what was accomplished \"in the past\" by sorcerers and sorceresses can now also be accomplished by \"technology\" etc. things can get, dicey. This seems to be especially true of computer \"hackers\", mathematicians, and other somewhat innocent techies, thinkers, geeks, and nerds. When someone accidentally stumbles on some of these \"discoveries\" red lights (figuratively speaking of course) go off at the \"Laundry\" and the person is \"swept up\". Generally speaking you then, agree not to go near your studies, computers etc. again...or you go to work for the Laundry. Our hero Robert, decided to work for the Laundry...Who are the Laundry?

Stross ran with that, applying advanced mathematics and theoretical physics over the genre of weird cosmic horror. The resulting hard science fiction verisimilitude gave me the urge to reach for the nearest Wikipedia article every time a character started technical talk. And, frankly, the pinpoint detailing of how, what, and why gave me willies far more effectively than Lovecraft's empurpled \"oh the indescribable mind-blasting horror\" ever did.Bob Howard's modern tendency toward ironic detachment and snark seems a strange pairing with the material--Lovecraft's narrators were so damn earnest--but I came to see it as a sort of Dilbertian defense mechanism.

I was actually more interested in The Atrocity Archive and \"The Concrete Jungle\" than I have been in most of his other books, which is a start, but I'm afraid a lot of it went over my head (not geeky enough) and some of it went under (fart jokes).All in all, the alternate history conjured up here is interesting, though I can't really talk about the mathematics, geometry, etc, because I can't write down my own phone number without transposing a digit or two. That somewhat hobbles the story, because I think there's humour and worldbuilding there that I just. don't. get. Which is unfortunately how Stross has made me feel before.I don't think I'll be reading any more of this series, though I quest on in my attempt to find a Stross book I genuinely enjoy.
