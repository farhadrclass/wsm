Williams and her debut Landfalls.Okay, I'll stop with the silly seafaring metaphors. But I won't stop raving about this unputdownable tour de force, crashingly good, tsunami of a novel. Williams offers a kaleidoscopic view of the ill-fated Lap\u00e9rouse expedition of 1785-89, which saw two frigates filled with over two hundred men attempt a circumnavigation of the globe for the glory of science, human endurance, and the maritime prowess of France. With each chapter the kaleidoscope shifts, offering a different perspective\u2014from seaman to scientist, Tlingit child to French castaway. Several of the chapters were published as short stories and in many ways this novel is a collection of individual works, as Williams leaps nimbly from voice, perspective, and style. Yet with each landfall, the threads of characters' lives are woven through the narrative, connecting each part to all those which precede it and the underlying tension of a well-paced thriller holds you fast. The author frames a daring, complicated structure and shores it up, page after page, with a gripping, marvelously inventive, and historically solid story.The scope of Williams's research is breathtaking yet, like modern masters of the form Mary Doria Russell, Hilary Mantel, David Mitchell, you are drawn naturally, unresistingly into a distant era by flesh-and-blood characters. Heartstrings are pulled in the opening pages and are never released, until the gasping end. There is humor and irony, violence and tragedy, longing and despair. I greedily devoured the pages of a dreamlike obsession with a child bride at a Chilean outpost, gasped at the crystalline and savage beauty of Alaska, burned with anger over sadistic priests on the California coast, mourned love found and lost during the heartbreaking Siberian journey of a translator and his devoted bodyguard. The scope of history and setting, of character and voice and emotion, is nothing short of astonishing. This is simply the best of what historical fiction can be: a voyage of discovery that speaks to the imagination and the heart, swallowing the reader whole like a literary whale."}, {"userName": "Magdalena aka A Bookaholic Swede", "userReviewDate": "Oct 07, 2015", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/1379514-magdalena-aka-a-bookaholic-swede", "userReview": "An epic voyage, undertaken with the grandest of ambitions.\nI had no previous knowledge of the Lap\u00e9rouse expedition before I read this book and I did not read about it on the internet until I just had a couple of pages left of the book to read. Two frigates left Brest in 1785 with two hundred men on board in a brave attempt to circumnavigate the globe. Every chapter in Landfalls is told from a different point of view. Both from the crew, natives, and other Europeans they encountered on their journey.I had some problem with the story I must admit. Mostly because I had no previous knowledge of the journey and also with the shifting between the characters. So it took a while for me to really get into the story, and some characters left a bigger impression on me than others did. I especially liked the chapters with the captains Lap\u00e9rouse and de Langle point of view.One of my favorite part of the book was when they reached Alaska and everything that happened there. It was then I really started to enjoy the book. I think the chapter with the native girl in Alaska, her point of view was just so amazing to read. Just think how it must have been, never seen Europeans before. Amazing.Also, the last part of the book, the mystery of what happened to the shop was just so fascinating to read about.I recommend this book to anyone that wants to know more about the Lap\u00e9rouse expedition or like to read historical fiction.Thank you Piatkus\u00a0for providing me with a free copy for an honest review!"}, {"userName": "Laura", "userReviewDate": "Jun 28, 2015", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/3081414-laura", "userReview": "(4.5 stars)This is a beautiful, enthralling and vivid book. I finished it yesterday and I already know that it\u2019s one of those that will stay with me and be sloshing around my brain for the next few weeks.Landfalls is a fictionalised account of the Laperouse voyage of discovery, which set out in 1785 from France with the aim of exploring unknown parts of the world and adding to scientific knowledge.If, like me, your French maritime history is a *little* rusty, then I would strongly recommend not googling the expedition before you read the book because spoilers. Having said that, this book would be thoroughly enjoyable regardless of how much you know about the expedition and the circumstances surrounding it. Upon the orders of Louis XVI, two ships - the Boussole and the Astrolabe - set sail from Brest in August 1785. They were tasked with sailing across the globe to establish new trade routes, improve maps and make scientific discoveries.(The Boussole and the Astrolabe at Port des Francais, now Lituya Bay, Alaska)Williams tells the story from the perspective of several characters on the two ships - including captains, engineers, sailors and scientists - as well as the various people that the expedition encountered. In the hands of a less talented writer, this could easily have been a story told just through the eyes of upper-class, white French men, but I was amazed at the diversity of voices that Williams managed to use, including several well-rounded female characters. The book is also full of humour, and some parts are genuinely funny - a big achievement when writing about naval history.I have to admit that the beginning was pretty slow, and I was suspicious at first. But the spectacular writing and vivid characterisation slowly drew me in until I really felt like I was there on those boats with the characters, celebrating their triumphs, mourning their losses and standing at their side as they discovered new and amazing things.I highly recommend this book, especially if you're a fan of historical fiction.

Rereading it reminded me of what is so fabulous about this book, and I think it might be edging into one of my top ten all time favorite books. (!)As with all the books I adore, I feel like I can't adequately explain why I loved it so and what about it was so compelling. In this case, it's everything -- the premise, the characters, the narrative style -- and this reread had me once again breathless in awe.Williams recounts the late 18th century voyage of the Astrolabe and Boussole, two French frigates tasked with further global exploration, scientific inquiry, and cartographic correction. Each chapter follows a different crew member, and details the dramatic and tragic journey of the two ships.I hesitate to say too much about what happened (don't google before reading) because much of my pleasure derived from learning about the voyage as I read. Williams beautiful articulates each character and every chapter is infused with tragic humanity; we're given hints of the fate to come, and can only watch everything unfold.Though focused on the French sailors, Williams still includes point of view from the indigenous communities the expedition met as well as women, which I greatly appreciated. While it's obvious she has keen sympathy for the French expedition, she doesn't make light of their hubris and colonialism, nor does she exoticize the indigenous populations the expedition meets (no cafe au lait skin comparisons!).The narrative style changes depending on the character, but even though we shift points of view, there is still rich emotional resonance in every offering. I teared up more than once -- I actually miss some of these characters! -- and I still feel breathless awe at Williams' skill in evoking emotion, place, and era so efficiently.I first read this book at the beach in 2015, cracking up my wife and mother because I kept gasping aloud every few pages; later that year, my brother -- who has pretty divergent reading tastes -- called me to recommend this book, having loved it himself. Regardless of whether you're a fan of historical fiction or not, if you enjoy books of very human foible and weakness, hope and aspiration, consider this novel -- I think you'll find it compelling.2015 ThoughtsOh.My.God.

As the title suggests, the book zeroes in on the stops the boat makes rather than on the daily drudgery of sailing on the open ocean. Williams moves between the perspectives of various crew members and outsiders, sometimes employing first person and sometimes third. Key chapters are set in South America, California, Alaska, Macao, and the Solomon Islands.I especially enjoyed a chapter from the point-of-view of a native Alaskan girl \u2013 one of the few times the novel focuses on female experience. One character\u2019s sled journey across Russia is another highlight. Some sections were less able to hold my attention; I thought the time in Concepci\u00f3n would never end, for instance. It\u2019s also a challenge to keep all the characters with names starting with \u201cLa\u201d straight.In general, though, this is cracking historical fiction. Enjoy it as such, without doing any Google searches that will ruin it for you. That there is vague resonance with \nJamrach\u2019s Menagerie\n tells you all you need to know about the journey \u2013 but despite minor tragedies along the way, the book maintains a light-hearted spirit."}, {"userName": "Jane", "userReviewDate": "Jan 09, 2016", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/2050107-jane", "userReview": "In her first book, Naomi J Williams has spun a lovely fiction round a fascinating piece of history.Two ships, the Boussole and the Astrolabe, set sail from Brest in August 1785; carrying officers, crew, engineers, artists, scientists, priests, interpreters and others. They were sailing under the orders of Louis XVI, into a world that was only partially mapped and very little known. They were to circumnavigate the globe; to create new maps and to open up trade routes; and to bring knowledge and understanding home to France.It was hoped, of course, that this expedition would cast a shadow over that of Captain Cook.I knew nothing at all about the history, I resisted looking it up, and I\u2019m very glad that I did; I\u2019m sure that I would have loved the book even if I had foreknowledge, but coming to this narrative as I did made it an enthralling voyage of discovery.\u2018Landfalls\u2019 is a collection of tales told in different voices. Some are told in the third person, by the most observant of omniscient narrators, but most are told in the first person, by some of the very different men who sailed on the two ships and by some of the people whose lives they touched.The range of the stories is wonderful \u2013 a young man very nearly out of his depth as he seeks vital supplies and intelligence in London; a journey across the Russian Steppes for another young man who had always been destine to leave the expedition there, for work in the diplomatic service; a misjudgement of currents in uncharted territory that could have terrible consequences; a man found dead, in circumstances that are far from clear \u2026.Some are stronger that others, and I wasn\u2019t surprised to learn that several had originally been short stories, but they come together to make a whole that is more than the sum of its parts. Because the progress of the expedition is always at the centre of the narrative, and because that expedition always felt so real and so alive.The scope of the research that underpins this novel is extraordinary; and that it was a work of love, and that the author gained a real depth of understanding of her subject is obvious. The fiction that she built on fact was both wonderfully inventive and utterly believable.She manages a large and diverse cast of characters with aplomb; threading them in and out of different stories. I didn\u2019t doubt that she always knew exactly who was on each ship, what each person\u2019s role was, what their history was, how they fitted in to the life of the expedition. If only the man called on to write a report after a certain incident had known as much \u2026.She writes perceptively of the complex relationships between people who much live and work at close quarters; the strain and tension between those who are not compatible and the bonds that are strengthened by shared experiences by those who are. She understood that even men who yearn to travel and explore feel the pull of home, and wonder and worry about the people they left behind.Each and every one of the places where the expedition finds land is vividly realised. The diversity and the differences were explored; as were the different perceptions of explorers and natives, and the gulf of understanding between them. I wondered how it must have felt, whether it was possible to understand, that your who world was just one stop on a journey, a place to do business and acquire fresh supplies before moving on \u2026.I was so impressed with the way Naomi J Williams assembled her pieces, to create a whole that had so many aspects and so much breadth and depth. A few of the pieces seemed less than perfect \u2013 an early story that went on for far too long; a late story that seemed less important than others that might have been told \u2013 but when I saw the whole I didn\u2019t think about that, I thought about the lives, about the history, about so many things.And so I have to say that \u2018Landfalls\u2019 is a very fine historical novel, that it sent me on a voyage of discovery, the like of which I could never have imagined; and that it spoke to both my head and my heart."}, {"userName": "David Reviews", "userReviewDate": "Jun 26, 2015", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/39964946-david-reviews", "userReview": "Landfalls tells the story of the 1785 voyage of two French ships in their quest to make new discoveries in a partially mapped world of the time. Commissioned by the French government of Louis XVI to sail around the globe they were to record new lands, verify charts and make new scientific findings in the name of France. Naomi Williams brings to life these voyages and expeditions conjuring wonderfully drawn scenes of faraway lands explored by brave seafaring men. Her fictional story is haunting and evocative and is narrated by various individuals on or related to the expedition. Based on true accounts from journals of the time the writing is sensitive and humane providing a beautifully imagined story that proves a fascinating read.Captain Jean-Fran\u00e7ois de La P\u00e9rouse is in charge. The two ships the Boussole and the Astrolabe have the latest navigational equipment of the time and along with the sailors they are carrying men of science. The expedition's aims were to correct and complete maps of the Pacific area, establish trade contacts and add to French scientific knowledge. Their objectives were geographic, scientific, ethnological, economic, and political while sending back reports through existing European outposts in the Pacific.La P\u00e9rouse and his crew have moments of triumph and of tragedy which are well described by the various narrators including some amusing moments. It is however easy to feel the tensions and the heart-break of men losing friends and colleagues as some explorations prove more dangerous than could have been expected. The expedition lasts four years as they make their way to numerous islands and usually welcoming isolated early European outposts. The sights and peoples described are engaging and believable some with their own stories to tell. If you enjoy inventive historical fiction then I\u2019m sure you will enjoy this novel as much as I did. It was a hugely interesting read and as educational as it was enjoyable.

Unfortunately, as can be seen from the rating, things didn't work out that way.I loved the idea of the way the author structured the book. The title describes what the author does really; she follows the Laperouse (my apologies Jacquette, that I am unable to work out how to include the all important accent) expedition, with particular focus on the occasions when the ship makes 'landfall'. The author gives snapshots of the interactions between the expeditioners and those living when they make port - both indigenous and colonisers. It's a really fantastic idea, and one I loved the idea of, but in practice it didn't work for me. Basically that 'snapshot' was too limited in scope, in development, in interest, for me to have any connection to either the characters or the events. I had thought that focusing on the 'landfalls' would release the book from the tedium of the weeks and months at sea.

Every Australian has heard of Lap\u00e9rouse, the French captain who in March 1788, \u201cafter a six-week sojourn at Botany Bay\u2026sailed off into the Pacific and was never heard from again\u201d (Robert Hughes, The Fatal Shore: The Epic of Australia's Founding, p. 85). There\u2019s even a suburb of Sydney named after him. Naomi J. Williams\u2019 meticulously researched book tells the story of Lap\u00e9rouse\u2019s voyage in fictional form. We begin at the French port of Brest in spring 1785, follow one character on a shopping trip to London the following month, and then we\u2019re off: in Tenerife, August 1785; in Concepci\u00f3n, Chile, February-March 1786; at Lituya Bay in Alaska, July 1786; in fog on the North American coast, August-September 1786; in Macao, January 1787; in Russia, 1787-1788; off the coast of Maouna Island in the South Pacific, December 1787; at Botany Bay, February 1788; on Vanikoro in the Solomon Islands, August 1791; then back in France for chapters set in April 1816 and March 1829.Most of the characters really existed, but some\u2014the native inhabitants of Alaska, \u201cNew Holland\u201d (as Australia was then known), and Vanikoro\u2014must be her own creations. All are drawn with a deep sympathy that is more than merely well observed: Williams has a profound understanding of human character, and a wry wit that shows rather than tells.There is nothing magical realist about Williams\u2019 writing, but I particularly enjoyed those passages where she steps forward and writes in her own voice. One example: What if, some two years, three months, and fifteen days after this afternoon of letter writing [home, from Tenerife], instead of joining the men who leave the ships to collect water and stretch their legs at an unknown cove in Samoa, Lamanon [the physicist, mineralogist, and meteorologist] were to remain safely aboard [Lap\u00e9rouse\u2019s flagship] the Boussole? And what if, instead of foundering in a storm in the Solomon Islands the following spring, the Boussole, at least, were to make it back to France? (p. 43), Williams postulates two possible outcomes for the aristocratic scientist: his work will be published, his scientific legacy secured. But then he would have made it back to France in time for the revolution: Which leaves us to meditate on a question: Which is worse\u2014violent death at the hands of natives whose language and anger you do not understand, or violent death at the hands of fellow citizens whose language and anger you thought you shared? (p. 45) Such are the questions she invites us to ponder with Lap\u00e9rouse, the men under his command, and the people he encounters on his long voyage of discovery. My only regret is those \u201chundreds of pages I ultimately discarded\u201d that Williams mentions in her Afterword: how I would love to have read those too!"}, {"userName": "Liz Barnsley", "userReviewDate": "Sep 16, 2015", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/16471876-liz-barnsley", "userReview": "Landfalls is a fictional account of a real historical journey \u2013 some beautifully vivid writing and in depth and cleverly drawn characters made for a really terrific read and something a little different for me \u2013 I do like different.It does take a while to get going \u2013 but the core feel of it will draw you in anyway \u2013 the author focuses on a selection of characters, not only those engaged in the voyage, but those they encounter and she weaves a stunningly evocative story that is engaging throughout.I knew nothing about the historical reality that this tale is based on, now I am aware of it I actually think that made this better \u2013 there was no expectation of anything, no knowledge of what may have been to come for the characters you end up getting so involved with.

Williams' Landfalls was my final choice on my Around the World in 80 Books challenge journey. I selected the novel, which takes place in several geographical locations - 'From the remote Alaskan bay, where a dreadful tragedy unfolds, to the wild journey Barthelemy de Lesseps undertakes from the far east of Russia to St Petersburg' - as my Pacific Islands choice. I did not really know what to expect with the novel; whilst I love stories of exploration, I have been rather disappointed with similar tomes in the past. The blurb, however, did intrigue me, promising to take me along on 'an epic voyage, undertaken with the grandest of ambitions.'Landfalls begins in 1785, and tracks many different characters who are connected in various ways with the real-life four-year long French government-backed expedition. Williams tells us, as she introduces some of the novel's characters, that 'this is to be a voyage of scientific and geographical discovery - but every person on board has their own hopes, ambitions and dreams.' The first chapter begins in spring of this year, at the French port of Brest. The voyage, which is being prepared at this point, is 'meant to compete with the accomplishments of the late Captain Cook, a voyage that is supposed to be secret until it departs.'Williams' writing is intelligent; whilst the descriptions are sadly few and far between, the prose seems very natural, and the third person perspective which has been used for several of the chapters sits well with the myriad stories which unfold. I found it rather problematic after a while that each chapter employs a different narrative style. The first is relatively fragmented, and others are long streams of prose given in the third or first person perspectives. The structure feels effective at first, but as the novel goes on, it is rather a jarring technique. The use of so many different narrative voices and characters almost made the novel feel like an interlinked short story collection. Whilst rather a rich and multilayered story is created, I personally enjoyed and connected with some of the chapters, but not with others. My interest waned when the particular story which Williams was telling did not grab me at all. Despite the way in which Williams based this novel upon a real expedition, the characters felt largely unrealistic, and two-dimensional.Landfalls has been meticulously researched. It is an ambitious novel, particularly for a debut. Sadly, I did not find the book an immersive one; as soon as I became interested in a particular character or thread of the story, it would end - sometimes quite abruptly - and something entirely different would be focused upon. There was an imbalance here. I felt as though Landfalls had far more potential than was realised, and the reading experience was slow and not overly enjoyable. Williams seems to subscribe far more to 'tell, don't show' than I personally like in my fiction; no vivid pictures were created, or even attempted here, despite the exotic and varied locales which Williams had at her disposal. The novel did not come together for me; it felt as though several loose ends had not been tied up, and the detachment which was present in most of the chapters did not endear me to the novel or its characters. There was not enough emotion here; whilst Williams sets out to show the effects such a voyage would have had on myriad characters, there is no real depth of feeling to be found within the pages of Landfalls."}, {"userName": "Fay Roberts", "userReviewDate": "Sep 01, 2015", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/28357676-fay-roberts", "userReview": "Initially drawn to Landfalls by the stunning cover of a stark white background with vivid flowers, and the comparison of the author to David Mitchell, I started to have regrets about the book as soon as the subject matter sank in. Did I really want to read about a French sea voyage taking place in the 1700\u2019s, apparently famous but one I\u2019d never heard of, taking place at a point in history I had no interest in? It turns out the answer was yes, I did, as I rate this book an enthralling 4.5 stars.Less of a novel and more a collection of short stories on a theme, Williams manage to turn what could be a very dull subject matter into an intriguing study of an ill-fated voyage. Throughout the first half of the book I was educated in all manner of things 18th century. Williams has a gift of educating without seeming like she is. The subtle references to fashion, social hierarchy, politics, and sexual attitudes made the life of the people of that time become vivid and real. One of the most intriguing aspects for me was discovering what life in a Spanish Mission could entail and the social nuances involved in parentage and prestige in colonies. This book is obviously meticulously researched. I was surprised when I reached the end and discovered that the author was American. It adds a new depth of skill to her writing and research that she was able to so accurately capture the feeling of casual and affectionate contempt and suspicion we Europeans have for each other. By switching the focus of each chapter of the book to a new viewpoint and a new area of life on board or in a colony the story stays fresh and vibrant. The first half manages to impart a wealth of knowledge in an entertaining way (like Horrid Hiotories for adults) and the second half wonderfully captures a pervading sense of doom. This was a wonderfully engaging and captivating book, meticulously researched and perfectly structured. Williams has a wonderful style and structure to her prose. Whilst inventive and fresh in construction, and portraying a possibly dense and dull subject matter, Landfalls is still accessible to the garden variety Bestseller and Book Club readers. I hope this wonderful debut novel achieves commercial success as I am sure that it will achieve critical acclaim and crop up on some of the prize lists this year. The only downsides I found were that it is difficult to keep track of the long French names throughout the novel but someone with a better memory wouldn\u2019t have problems with this. Also, as a personal preference, I wasn\u2019t 100% sure about the points of view of natives. I loved the fictionalised version of their culture and beliefs but the Williams\u2019 voice is so strong that it eclipses the simplistic notions she is trying to portray, and although her sentence structure changes to mirror their characters her vocabulary doesn\u2019t. These chapters are still strong, interesting and vital to the narrative but were the weakest area in the book for me."}, {"userName": "Nancy Oakes", "userReviewDate": "Aug 21, 2015", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/900340-nancy-oakes", "userReview": "like a 3.6 I didn't love this book as much as others seem to have, so if somebody in the US wants my copy (hardcover, signed), it's yours. Free, I'll pay postage. Someone please give it a home!!!!Here's part of the blurb: \"In her wildly inventive debut novel, Naomi J. Williams reimagines the historical Lap\u00e9rouse expedition, a voyage of exploration that left Brest in 1785 with two frigates, more than two hundred men, and overblown Enlightenment ideals and expectations, in a brave attempt to circumnavigate the globe for science and the glory of France.\"I didn't actually choose this book for myself; it was the choice for October from Book Passage's signed first editions club. However, when I read that very same blurb paragraph, I was immediately hooked and into the vacation book bag it went. I have this strange fascination with all things seafaring explorers, and I figured this was going to be great. And for a time, I was well into it. Landfalls begins with a visit to England by a French naval engineer who's come in disguise to pick up needed things for the voyage of two ships, the Boussole and the Astrolabe, both of which are under the command of Jean-Francois de Galaup, Comte de Lap\u00e9rouse. The expedition (thankfully there's a great map of Lap\u00e9rouse's travels in the front of the book) went from 1785 to 1788, at which time no more word was ever heard from le Comte or from anyone else still with him. I say \"still with him,\" because like many other voyages of the time, a number of the explorers/crew on this expedition didn't survive some of the ever-present dangers of contact with other cultures. In real life, according to Wikipedia, Lap\u00e9rouse vanished from the face of the earth somewhere in \"Oceania;\" Williams puts his last sighting somewhere in the Solomon Islands.But back to the book. It is labeled as a novel, but to me it read much more like a collection of vignettes that occur before, during and after the expedition. Once the expedition begins, the author's major focus here is not life on the sea but rather the \"landfalls\" the ship makes. For example, in Alaska, a young Tlingit girl witnesses her first Europeans and a major tragedy, which she tries to relate from her own cultural point of view; as another example, in Monterey California, the story switches to a series of letters back and forth in which Spanish missionary contact with the French explorers is related. Another episode is related in Concepci\u00f3n, Chile, where Laperouse finds himself in a bit of competition with an expedition member for the wife of his host, wrestling with his conscience because of the wife he'd left behind. The best chapter in this entire book is \"The Report,\" in which an officer is commanded to produce a report after a horrific tragedy, and as he works his way through it, the reader is made privy to a terrible revelation. Indeed, there are many moments in this book where the reader is right there at some major event, feeling what the characters feel (the scene in Concepci\u00f3n with the hot-air balloons, in Monterey where the good Catholic priests beat their religion into the indigenous people, or a much later scene where the character watches in despair as the hope of rescue disappears on the horizon). Sometimes this approach works, sometimes it doesn't quite do it (as in the scene through the Russian winter), and on the whole, I came away feeling like my job as a reader here was to put a series of disjointed stories together to cohere as a novel which wasn't really my responsibility at all. Despite my negative niggles though, there is much to enjoy about this book, especially in how Ms. Williams reimagines and interprets an expedition that most people have never heard of. But it's not just the expedition itself that captured my interest. She goes big and bold, for example, in the chapter \"Lamanon at Sea,\" where she imagines a scientist's return to France in the midst of the Terror, offering her readers a look at the sort of society in which Enlightenment ideals have gone wildly astray leading to social and political upheaval of the worst sort. The way she writes this part of the chapter is just unbelievably good and I found myself at various points in this book unable to put it down. So far readers are loving this book. The Historical Novel Society rates it positively, as does Katherine A. Powers at The Christian Science Monitor. I have to agree that Landfalls is a highly intelligent work; had it not felt so disjointed and jarring and distinctly non-novelish, I probably would have enjoyed it much more than I did. Still, I would most definitely recommend it to anyone who likes quality historical fiction. I will also say that it is very, very obvious that Ms. Williams has spent a LOT of time researching her material, something that the history person inside of me greatly appreciates."}, {"userName": "Caroline Mersey", "userReviewDate": "Nov 09, 2015", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/17722556-caroline-mersey", "userReview": "Landfalls is the debut novel by Naomi J Williams. It was published by Little, Brown (who kindly gave me a review copy through NetGalley) on 22 October 2015. Landfalls unfolds for us a fictionalised version of a true story: the doomed French voyage of exploration led by the Comte de Laperouse in the 1780s. Both ships mysteriously disappeared in the Pacific Ocean in 1788.Structurally, Landfalls is a very interesting novel. Williams chooses to write each chapter from the perspective of a different character, writing only about those times where the expedition\u2019s ships make landfall as part of their voyage of exploration. That allows her to explore the different members of the crew, their relationships with one another and their thoughts and feelings about the voyage.Some of those chapters are intensely moving, in particular those dealing with the loss of life of some crew members at various points during the voyage. We see the grief of those left behind, struggling to make sense of their loss and find ways of explaining it to distant family members. In others, Williams shows the narrow and limited lives of those living in far-flung colonies. The arrival of the expedition ships provides a welcome dose of excitement and fresh company that can have profound effects on those visited by the expedition.Only two chapters are told from the perspective of female characters. One of the chapters shows the disastrous loss of two of the ships longboats in a freak accident while surveying a harbour in Alaska. The woman is one of the indigenous people from the tribe living in the area. Towards the end of the novel, we see the end of the Laperouse expedition from the perspective of another indigenous woman, this time form the Solomon Islands. Both women are left baffled by the strange Europeans visiting where they live, whether in a brief visit, or the survivors of the doomed expedition.Overall, Landfalls is a fascinating and accomplished novel that allows Williams to showcase her skills as a writer. Its braided narrative structure reminded me slightly of Ian Pears\u2019s An Instance of the Fingerpost, albeit with less close weaving between the individual storylines."}, {"userName": "Carol", "userReviewDate": "Oct 09, 2015", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/2534237-carol", "userReview": "Bravissimo to Naomi Williams, author of this, her first novel! It was a challenging launch for me: the Lap\u00e9rouse Expedition? 1785 France? My brain didn't have any hooks for the loops of this story to Velcro to. I ran across new seafaring vocabulary every chapter. Although it's not exotic, \"landfalls\" was not a word I could confidently define*. The structure also sloshes against solid understanding: a new location and new narrator for every chapter, feeling like a collection of autobiographical essays. Looking back from the end of the book, I see this as brilliant move. This is an epic voyage that rewards the patient reader. This is writing which delights the discriminating reader. Williams compels you to care; at the end you feel empty.*I read this book concurrently with Tim Severin's The Brendan Voyage where \"anticipating a landfall\" and \"made a landfall\" are common phrases. But the ultimate synchronicity came while I read C.S. Lewis' A Grief Observed: \"...the journey ends. How can I assume a harbour? A lee shore, more likely, a black night, a deafening gale, breakers ahead--and any lights shown from the land probably being waved by wreckers. Such was H.'s landfall. Such was my mother's.

Der historische Hintergrund:Die dreij\u00e4hrige Expedition f\u00fchrte die beiden franz\u00f6sischen Fregatten Astrolabe und Boussole (die kurz zuvor noch als Frachtschiffe gedient hatten) zwischen 1785 und 1788 von Europa an der zentralafrikanischen K\u00fcste entlang, um Kap Hoorn zur nordamerikanischen Westk\u00fcste \u00fcber Macao, Kamtschatka bis ins damals noch Neuholland genannte Australien. Die beiden (realen) Schiffe verschwanden damals samt Mannschaft spurlos, ihr Schicksal wurde erst Jahre sp\u00e4ter gekl\u00e4rt.InhaltNaomi J. Williams l\u00e4sst zahlreiche Personen ihre Erlebnisse auf dieser wissenschaftlichen Expedition berichten, mehrere Icherz\u00e4hler treten auf, Briefwechsel stellen Beziehungen zwischen den handelnden Figuren her und manche Szenen werden aus verschiedenen Blickwinkeln gezeigt. Die amerikanische Autorin beschr\u00e4nkt sich mit wenigen Ausnahmen auf die Sicht der Oberschicht, der Offiziere, Wissenschaftler, Priester und Dolmetscher an Bord. Etwas Farbe bekommt die Angelegenheit durch das Auftreten der Ehefrau des chilenischen Gouverneurs und eines jungen Inuit-M\u00e4dchens in Alaska. Indem Lamartini\u00e8re, der Botaniker der Expedition, sich haupts\u00e4chlich mit dem Protokollieren der Reise befasst und weniger mit seiner Profession, bleiben die naturkundlichen Beobachtungen auf der Reise leider sehr blass. Mehr als die Sichtung \"eines B\u00e4ren\" oder \"eines Seevogels\" darf man nicht erwarten. Die Konzentration der Erz\u00e4hlweise auf die Beziehungsebene l\u00e4sst Willams Roman wie einen Gesellschaftsroman wirken, den sie an Bord zweier franz\u00f6sischer Schiffe angesiedelt hat. Die f\u00fcr mich spannenden Fragen in einem Entdecker-Roman werden nicht vertieft, z. B. wie ein Kapit\u00e4n in der Notsituation handelt, nachdem ein entscheidender Teil seiner Mannschaft ausgefallen ist.FazitWilliams Ton ist zeitweilig bissig bis ironisch, so dass ich ihre Sichtweise teils als Satire auf Entdeckerromane empfunden habe. Zu diesem Eindruck trug die wenig seem\u00e4nnische Beschreibung des Lebens an Bord bei. Ob die Autorin diese Wirkung urspr\u00fcnglich bezweckt hat oder ob durch die \u00dcbersetzung ein ernstgemeinter Text unbeabsichtigt eine satirische Wirkung erhielt, kann ich nicht beurteilen.

From the beautiful cover to the promising description (\u201cgrounded in historical fact . . . refracted through a powerful imagination\u201d), Landfalls appeared to me a definite win. Then it went nowhere for me. That is to say, it was incredibly dry, which is ironic considering that this is a novel at sea, but\u2014a ha!\u2014'tis not a novel at sea at all, but a collection of stories that occur when the sea voyager is docked, a fact that should be obvious by the blatant title but wasn't clear to me until the third chapter or so. That sentence feels like it needs several exclamation points, doesn't it? Okay, let's go back. ...wasn't clear to me until the third chapter or so!(!!)!! Doesn't have the same effect now, does it? Okay, moving on.So reading Landfalls had its ups and downs. Many of these stories didn't resonate with me. Some really did. But I think the book's greatest flaw is its very concept, that of focusing only on the landfalls of the Lap\u00e9rouse expedition. Seafaring voyages are made by what happens at sea, not on land. On land, the characters are not stretched in the same way. The reader doesn't really get to know these characters and how they have interacted and grown together. The characters are put at sea together and more than six months pass before their first landing. What happens in all this time? How have these men grown? How have they rallied together? How have they struggled with one another? These are the stories I want. Instead, what we're offered are the men's time cavorting with Spanish dignitaries and locals. Indeed, these moments are important too, but I feel like I'm missing a big chunk of the story. Frankly, for the most part, I had trouble differentiating the characters because I never really got to know them on the voyage. I felt like I was locked away in the hold of the ship, then, upon reaching land, I was released and allowed to follow whatever crewmember I wanted until the ship again disembarked. Then, the process was repeated over and again. By the end, I felt unsure of where I was in the world and who I'd spent all that time with.As I stated earlier, there are definitely some strong moments in this novel. A few of the stories\u2014particularly those where members of the crew interact with locals of a very different culture\u2014are simply amazing. Throughout the book, the writing is flawless. Indeed, Williams is an exceptionally talented author. As a whole, however, Landfalls didn't keep me interested enough.

Landfalls, however, is the rare book that excels in almost every area. The writing is absolutely gorgeous. The characters--and there are many of them--seem fully human. Williams is skilled at portraying the intricacies and subtleties of human relationships, both between people who know each other well and between people who barely know each other at all. The research for the book was clearly beyond meticulous, and yet it is always woven naturally into the story.I also thoroughly enjoyed the book's format. Most of the chapters could stand as individual short stories; some are truly exquisite works of art in their own right. Part of the reason the format works so well is because each stop on the journey really is a mini-story of its own, so it does not feel like a forced conceit as it might in a different sort of book. While the overall writing style is similar throughout, the stories are each a little different in that some are told from various viewpoints, or as letters, reports, etc. Another thing I appreciated about the book is that Williams clearly made an effort to stay true to the time period. Whereas any historical fiction book always says at least as much about the time period during which it was written as the time period it is written about, there's no obvious attempt to give 21st century sensibilities to the characters in order to make them more appealing. Additionally, despite the often grim storylines, there's plenty of humor in the book. There's also a lot to chew on. It's the kind of book I'll remember for a long time, and probably read parts of again. Landfalls is not a lightning-fast-paced book, which is more than fine. Not every book needs to be. The book really starts to hit its stride around the third chapter. I very much enjoyed the beginning, but it does start out at a leisurely pace, and I'd encourage anyone who is an impatient reader to keep going--it's well worth the trip.

Williams is retelling the story of the Laperouse expedition, a voyage of scientific discovery, with the aim of more accurately mapping the known world, studying its flora and fauna, establishing trade routes and basically getting one over on every other country in Europe. This is a period and an area of history I knew next to nothing about but Williams has evocatively brought it all to life in this novel. The characters are absolutely wonderful and completely distinct from one another - she manages to flit between characters with ease, never losing her reader and creating wonderful contrasts and amusing revelations. A particular favourite scene of mine was that of a sailor encountering a young native Alaskan girl - Williams tells the encounter from each perspective, showing how those sharing no language, experience or culture in common can interpret and understand one another.There are many touching moments in this novel, as they suffer casualties and visit Europeans who have set up home in these far flung territories, away from their families, friends and any hope of a normal life. There is so much humour in the story and there are genuinely funny moments. I was absolutely swept along by the narrative, which focuses on the times when the ship makes \u2018landfalls\u2019, I enjoyed it so much I would like to have seen more of their adventures and seen a bit more how they spent their time at sea with nothing to do.

This was an easy-to-read fictionalised account of his travels.I think the narrative's fractured presentation is what made it so easy-to-read. Instead of a focus on the travails of life at sea, it was about \"landfalls\". The events at different ports of call, or associated land happenings, were told by a variety of voices. This gave a range of perspective and style, making it almost a collection of short stories that took us on a voyage of discovery of culture, of personality, of the world of the time. But it was much more than a collection of stories!

This novel is based on the Laperouse expedition, departing from Brest, France in 1785 until their demise in 1788. Two ships, Boussole and Astrolabe, set sail with 200 crewmen. Captain Jean-Francois de Galaup de Laperouse leads the Boussole and Captain Paul-Antoine-Marie Fleuriot, Viscount de Langle leads the Astrolabe. The fictional aspects of the novel occur in the historical ports and areas they visited and/or discovered. The book is rich in factual and fictional detail.The novel opens with two stoves being installed in the ships for the chefs to prepare great meals with fresh baked bread and the purchases for the voyage being made in London by Paul-Merault de Monneron of astrology equipment, beads and fishing hooks to be given as gifts along the journey and all of the other paraphernalia required for a long voyage. They make land after seven months in Concepcion Bay to find the town destroyed by an earthquake and tsunami thirty-five years prior in 1751. The town has been rebuilt inland. They are the guests of Mayor Sabatero, his wife Eleonora, and General O'Higgins. Laperouse's borther-in law Frederic causes disruption in the town and historical fact seaman Dufrense asks to leave the voyage and wait for another ship to return to France but his request is denied. The men ponder what they have left behind and what awaits them on the voyage and upon their return home. Laperouse thinks of his wife and the possibility she might be pregnant. He is attracted to Eleonora but maintains his decorum.They next set sail for Alaska and at Cenotaph Island twenty-one men are lost surveying a bay. September 1786 they arrive in Monterey Bay and are guests at the San Carlos Mission in Carmel which is depicted as a barbaric living arrangement with Frayers who are not kind to the natives. They leave a millstone for the Indian women to grind corn into flour. The Russian coast at Petropavlovsk is their next destination and they arrive two years after leaving Brest. At Kamchatka, Barth\u00e9lemy de Lesseps is commissioned to journey to St. Petersburg to bring to the French Ambassador their findings, recordings, maps, and journals. He makes the harrowing eleven month journey across dangerous and frozen tundra with Igor Golikoff. It is this information which Lesseps brings to the Ambassador that provided much foundation for the writing of this novel. After Lesseps disembarks, the ships set sail for Maouna Island, Navigators Archipelago where they have a terrible encounter with the island natives. Fourteen are dead. The physicist Jean-Honore-Robert de Paul de Lamanon and Captain Viscount de Langle are two of the deceased. Forty-nine men remain. Monsieur de Vaujaus is ordered by Captain Leperouse to write a detailed report of the attack as he is one of the few survivors of the encounter with the natives. In Botany Bay February 1788, chief engineer Paul-Merault de Monneron and others recant how they found the deceased body of Father Receveur, the chaplain of Astrolabe, on shore in the mangroves. Social order and to some degree sanity seem to be falling apart at this point in the voyage. Fictionally, Williams has a sole survivor called Vo by the natives. Vo takes an undesirable village woman, Oriela, as his partner and they have a daughter. He begins to teach his baby daughter French. Vo has some of the tools and a telescope from one of the ships. He knows he is forever stranded on the island. As I reader I couldn't decipher the original identify of Vo. We know he is one of the forty-nine survivors after the attack at Massacre Island.We don't know what becomes of the ships after this point but they are destroyed. Perhaps some of them survived and were washed onto the island of Vanikoro in the Solomon Islands. We do know that an Irishman, Peter Dillion, visits the village and brings back many artifacts from the ships. He meets with Lesseps, who is sixty-three, and Lesseps identifies the relics as being from the Boussole and Astrolabe. Hence, scuba diving teams have found the wreckage of the ships off the coast of Vanikoro. There has been speculation for years that the survivors of the wreckage were cannibalized.

Williams reimagines the historical Lap\u00e9rouse expedition, a voyage of exploration that left Brest in 1785 with two frigates, more than two hundred men, and overblown Enlightenment ideals and expectations, in a brave attempt to circumnavigate the globe for science and the glory of France.Deeply grounded in historical fact but refracted through a powerful imagination, Landfalls follows the exploits and heartbreaks not only of the men on the ships but also of the people affected by the voyage-indigenous people and other Europeans the explorers encountered, loved ones left waiting at home, and those who survived and remembered the expedition later. Each chapter is told from a different point of view and is set in a different part of the world, ranging from London to Tenerife, from Alaska to remote South Pacific islands to Siberia, and eventually back to France. The result is a beautifully written and absorbing tale of the high seas, scientific exploration, human tragedy, and the world on the cusp of the modern era.By turns elegiac, profound, and comic, Landfalls reinvents the maritime adventure novel for the twenty-first century.", "title": "Landfalls", "url": "http://www.goodreads.com/book/show/22929561-landfalls", "average": 3.92, "cover": "https://images.gr-assets.com/books/1415428280l/22929561.jpg", "reviews": 152, "authors": [{"url": "https://www.goodreads.com/author/show/13993270.Naomi_J_Williams", "name": "Naomi J.
