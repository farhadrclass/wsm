Many excellent books have been written on the topic that address various aspects of adoption. However, Kathryn Joyce skillfully weaves together that history with today's grim realities on the subject. This book should be required reading in the White House, the State Department and Congress. Though adoption has become a multimillion dollar industry it operates with almost no meaningful regulation by the US government. Policy makers, hounded by adoption industry lobbyists and their allies, have bamboozled politicians and unwitting consumers creating a scenario of consumer abuses that would be soundly rejected in any other field. This lack of vigilance has translated into a global lack of confidence in US policy in this area that threatens to end this worthwhile social practice altogether. Joyce lays out the myriad ways in which adoption - whether private domestic, foster care or international adoption from a dizzying array of foreign countries - has become a big business at the expense of families - both birth and adoptive. Every family who has adopted or is considering adoption should read this carefully researched sobering book about an important social practice run amok. In fact, it is a must read for anyone who cares about children, period. To say it is filled with food for thought about our collective negligence as a country for allowing these abuses not just to continue but escalate would be an understatement."}, {"userName": "Shannon Cate", "userReviewDate": "May 25, 2013", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/5014642-shannon-cate", "userReview": "We in the adoption reform movement have long known that big problems hide behind sentimental, idealistic rhetoric when it comes to adoption. Joyce does a fabulous job of bringing out the true complexity behind simplistic assumptions about the needs of world-wide \"orphans\" and what is in their best interest.Too often, adoption fills the emotional needs of adoptive parents or worse, fills the pockets of baby brokers in the U.S. and elsewhere.If you care about children's (or their mothers' and families' and communities') welfare, this is a must-read book.If you are considering adoption, this book should be required for your home study.If you are considering placing a child for adoption, let this book introduce you to information the agencies and maternity homes will not give you.I found this book highly readable in spite of the sometimes labyrinthine complexity of the issues, policies and histories it explores.Kudos to Joyce."}, {"userName": "Marley", "userReviewDate": "Apr 22, 2013", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/2350757-marley", "userReview": "I really wish I could write book reviews instead of blather on about not much.The Child Catchers: Rescue, Trafficking and the New Gospel of Adoption, is the best book about adoption ever written. (Full disclosure: I'm mentioned in the credits 4 times). Kathryn contacted me years ago when she was in the early stages of the book. I told her I didn't know much about international adoption outside of the murders of Russian adopatees in the US, but gave her a list of people who did. I'm happy to see that some of them were sources and quoted. I do, however, know quite a bit about \"Christian\" adoption-for-conversion and the \"orphan crisis\" and have written about it a little bit (particularly Haiti). Kathryn just nailed it. It's a book that I would have loved to have written. The chapter on Haiti is excellent. Most disturbing for me were the chapters on Liberia and Above Rubies, and the next chapter \"Pipeline Problems.\" I knew nothing about Liberia and the amount I knew about pipeline problems pales in comparison to what Katheryn has written.International Adoption is a out-of control corrupt \"social child welfare\" practice that needs to die. In the old days the US (and other countries) raped less fortunate countries for natural resources and material goods IA, however, as operated by US adoption thugs(usually under the guise of \"christian\" endeavor) is I suppose more like date rape--child expropriation by \"friends.\" Not in the book, but a couple years ago I attended a NCFA conference where do-gooder adopter lawyer Elizabeth Bartholet informed us that parents and countries that send their children to other countries empower themselves. IA is all about Christians (and others) who view the world through the lens of the middle class Protestant ethic. The amount of money it takes to complete one IA could be used to preserve dozens of families. If course, if IA were to finally flop--and it seems to be for many reasons--the adoption industry will ramp up child expropriation at home. Apparently there is something quite horrible about children being reared by their own parents.

Immaculately researched and painstakingly balanced, the book is like a saunter along a maze of interlocking paths of good intentions, which all seem somehow, to lead inexorably to someone's hell. Joyce's book, however, isn't a blanket condemnation as much as an effort to raise the problems, in the hope of starting a conversation that might make things better.I've had the Child Catchers on pre-order for some time, and immediately dropped my other reading when it arrived winking at me on the Kindle. Joyce is the only authoritative US feminist journalist covering religion, and as someone with a deep interest in how ideas about gender are both reflected in, and influenced by, religion, I tend to read everything she writes. In the last five years, I have also noticed the immense growth in adoption, particularly from Africa, among evangelical \"mommy bloggers\", and I was looking forward to a more systematic coverage of where this particularly theological orientation came from.Joyce does cover this off, but the book is much more than that. She delves deeply into the phenomenon of US adoption from the 1930s onward, both domestic and international. Raising questions not only about the involvement of evangelical churches in adoptions, but of adoption agencies. Joyce did more than 200 interviews for the book, and you can see why. The book is populated with people trying so hard to do good, in a very morally murky world. Joyce is at pains to present the view of all the participants - adoptive parents, \"birthmothers\", church representatives, adoption agencies, church and secular welfare workers, and of course, adult adoptees.I have no intention of summarising the content of the book in this review - go read it! - but the issues raised bear some discussion.Going in to the book, I had few opinions about adoption. Like most people, I know adoptive parents, adoptees and a couple of people who relinquished children to adoption. I have enormous time for the adoptive parents I know. I have always assumed adoption is a \"win-win\" scenario in most cases. But this presents an equation that seems somewhat equal - adults who wish to parent on one hand, and children without parental support on the other. But where the former group have economic power, and the latter do not, the result is more like a commodity market than a social program.A simple example of this is the growth of orphanages in the developing world. Orphanages attract very large amounts of funding from the West. Who doesn't give money to support an orphanage? But orphanages are also widely known to be simply the worst environments to raise children. In Australia, we foster kids out because it is better for them (acknowledging the many issues). But in places like Cambodia or Uganda, fundraising for an orphanage is much easier than attracting funding for a new social program. And, of course, adoptive parents want to rescue children from orphanages - which they know are terrible environments, and orphanages are easy for adoption agencies to work with. So the orphanages remain as key parts of the strategy, even in countries making a concerted effort to develop more stable programs based on family support, foster care and domestic adoption.At the heart of Joyce's argument is one of numbers. The evangelicals claim in excess of 200 million orphans internationally (counting all kids who have lost ONE parent - the number who lost both is less than 10% of that, and the number with no extended family care less again), and calling for adoption as a social need. Joyce points out brutally, however, that in actual fact the number of parents who want to adopt vastly outstrips the number of children available for adoption. The demand is coming from the West - for children, the strongest social need is for better support for families locally, not for someone to take the kids away. This difference in perception - builds on neo-racist theology in the evangelical churches that views every child adopted as \"saved\" from a barbaric (*cough* heathen *cough*) environment.Time and again, Joyce describes situations where, no matter how individuals and governments try to avoid it, the sheer amount of money that adoptive parents pour into a country distorts the local view of adoption - where communities calculate that aid and development money follows adoption, and giving up kids for the greater good becomes part of a strategy.Joyce is largely successful in distinguishing between the situation of most individuals within this system and the broader dynamic, describing how several heroic adoptive parents navigate the system and the injustices with compassion and an attempt to find the best solution for the children in front of them, which may well be adoption in the U.S. Orphans created by the system, still, in many cases, remain orphans.She avoids, frankly, dwelling overly on some of the more sensational coverage - the killings of three adopted kids by evangelical parents in the US, which received a lot of media - are only mentioned in passing, for example. She does cover with some clear fury the worst abuses associated with the following of the Above Rubies crowd, including not filing paperwork within the US, so children adopted from Liberia in particular, can be abandoned without legal consequence, while the children end up effective illegal immigrants, unable to go to college, or get a driver's licence.Perhaps the most devastating chapters, however, involve the stories of relinquishing parents in wealthy countries - the US and South Korea. Joyce de-constructs how the anti-abortion pregnancy advisory services are placing an ever-increasing emphasis on convincing women to relinquish - using hefty doses of guilt, deceitful legal practice and stereotype (what future can you offer?) to do so.There are few solutions offered. Some glimmers of hope in more localised programs in countries such as Rwanda, and legal changes in South Korea. But what seemed to me as the central issue - how do we better support children, and those who want children, in a non-market way - is not directly tackled by the book. Is this about building a global village? Do we have to accept that being part of a broader family is a better solution than transplanting kids from one nuclear family to another? I honestly don't know.There are a couple of quibbles - I always have some!. Given that the central question is that of what is best for a child, I wanted more experiences of adult adoptees, and perhaps in particular, those who felt more positively of their experience. The shocking statistics covering the decline in white American women relinquishing are all measured in never-married - it would be nice to what extent the growth in de-facto couples parenting distort those - but really, one of the most important, and troubling, books I've read in a long time."}, {"userName": "Alex King", "userReviewDate": "Sep 24, 2013", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/22468330-alex-king", "userReview": "If you have thought about adopting a child, you owe it to yourself to read this book. If you have adopted a child, particularly in an international adoption, all the more so. Please note that I'm not suggesting you will enjoy the ride, as the author deftly sucks you into a whirlwind of corruption committed in the name of rescuing orphans.You may find yourself trying to argue with the book's conclusions, with the excuse that these are only the horror stories, that most adoptions turn out well. Most of the time that's true, but ends don't justify means. By describing the worst cases of children caught in a system that disregards their rights, 'The Child Catchers' devastates the rationalization that adoption saves orphans. Taking children from families in developing countries is tragically common; it's at best an inefficient method to make them better off, and at worst child trafficking driven by the profit motive.This book will not be prescribed as a sleep aid to adoptive parents. It may cause nagging thoughts about whether what you were told about your child's origin is true enough. After reading, you may ask yourself how to live with the ambiguity of never knowing for certain. Perhaps you'll do what I did: initiate an(other) inquiry to find out what happened to the child you love so much, before the adoption. Knowing the scale and scope of deceptions practiced against first families in developing countries, as well as adoptive families with the best intentions, may trouble the reader. As it should. There are troubling patterns repeated in the business of international adoptions, and Kathryn Joyce has documented them thoroughly. This book bothered me. Strongly recommended."}, {"userName": "Elizabeth Stolar", "userReviewDate": "May 31, 2013", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/8442094-elizabeth-stolar", "userReview": "I'm not really sure how many stars I want to give this book. On the one hand, I am so glad I read it and I highly recommend it because it contained so much information, and gave some really good insight into some of the aspects that play into adoption. But on the other hand, there were some parts that were really glossed over, and some acceptance of groups like UNICEF that weren't really fully explored or addressed. While Ms. Joyce points out some very troublesome and problematic aspects of adoption (not just those that take place internationally, but also with in the U.S.), she ignores other problems that arise out of some of the solutions that she seems to embrace. At one point, she discusses a country that is dedicated to minimizing the number of out-of-country adoptions, and gives an example of a girl who would have been eligible for adoption, but was not, because her birthmother was known, but was in a mental institution. Joyce implicitly approves of this outcome -- that the girl would likely lose all ties with her mother were she to be adopted abroad. Yet, obviously the mother is not able to care for her, and there's no indication that she will be able to do so in the future. How is the girl's situation better than being adopted abroad? Similarly, she seems to approve of measures that require that all efforts be made to first find genetic relatives of the child who will hopefully care for him or her, before the child is eligible for adoption, sometimes even requiring these efforts to go on for 6 months or more. However, who is to say that a biological relative is the best caregiver for such a child? In many circumstances, a birthmother may relinquish or abandon a child because the family disapproved of the pregnancy or may have been abusive or otherwise dysfunctional. What would be gained by seeking these same relatives, from whom the mother might have wanted to hide the pregnancy (especially in some societies where an out of wedlock pregnancy is particularly shameful)?Another point, although minor, is that she references a conference about adoption and repeatedly refers to it as occurring at NYU Law School. This is incorrect. I have attended the conferences, and they are at New York Law School, which although it is still in New York, and is still a law school, is an entirely different law school than NYU's law school. There is an undertone to the discussion of this conferences that it is an elite conference, partially due to it's affiliation with NYU, but there is no such affiliation. Again, I admit this is a minor point, and the conference attendees could still be referred to as \"elite\" in that they included many government officials and lawyers, policy makers, doctors, and professors who work in fields related to adoption. But the repeated incorrect reference was nevertheless slightly troubling. This book tackles a huge array of issues in adoption, some of which are more problematic than others, and Joyce sometimes conflates situations that aren't really similar. Some issues are pointed out as problematic, when I don't believe they are necessarily so, or not nearly as much as she seems to believe. On the whole, however, the religious calling to adopt is a huge problem in that it creates this demand that cannot be fulfilled and leads people to adopt for the wrong reasons. People should not be adopting because they think they are saving a child, or because they think it will somehow curry favor with God, or because they think they are somehow performing a good deed. They should adopt only because they want to parent a child. It is troubling how many people are becoming involved in adoption for entirely wrong reasons, and the results of this are too frequently tragic for everyone involved. In addition, the idea that adoption issues really stem from women's rights (or lack thereof) and women's inequality is very insightful, as is the observation that poverty, together with women's equality, are really the biggest issues to address when attempting to tackle the plight of children who live in dire conditions."}, {"userName": "Kay", "userReviewDate": "Feb 22, 2015", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/62698-kay", "userReview": "The measure of a good nonfiction book for me is to make me think about something differently. It's fair to say that after reading Kathryn Joyce's book, I will never look at adoption in the same way again. Though I'd always thought about adoption as something admirable but difficult, I didn't really have a great sense of how deeply the evangelical Christian movement was committed to adoption as means of spreading the Gospel. This is why you see tea party conservatives gather their multicultural families around them in campaign ads -- they're part of the deep mythos of rescuing children for God. This is all a nice idea, of course, but the demand created by evangelical families has created the incentives to do a lot of really terrible things. Joyce carefully documents numerous instances of families who discover that the children they're adopting, often from abroad, often have living parents still, and the cultural disconnect about the permanence of American adoption often leads families to think they're merely sending their children away to American boarding schools rather than agreeing to give up their children for good. Joyce carefully does the math. The number of truly unwanted children who have no living relatives, even by the highest estimates, is far exceeded by the number of Christian adoption families. She also dives into the motivation behind Crisis Pregnancy Centers -- that the idea isn't merely to convince young women to carry through with their adoptions but also to give those children up to the insatiable demand of Christian families who want to rescue children. This is all too often ineffective. It's true when you look at the data. Poor women in America are the most likely to have unintended pregnancies, but they are also not very likely to give their children up for adoption, because of course, they want to keep their families intact. It makes the \"you can always choose adoption\" slogan pro-lifers so often fling around as an argument ring hollow. The book isn't perfect. She looks at one adoption gone awry where a young women signs away her child under false pretenses and spends the rest of her life longing after a child that is hers but no longer belongs to her. Joyce barely addresses the adoptive family in that chapter. While it's easy to paint one side as a villain and another as a victim, adoption is itself an extremely complicated issue, where both sides often struggle.In the weeks since reading this book, a high-profile case popped up in Arkansas, where a Christian politician's family adopted children from the state's program, only to think they were possessed by demons, and gives them up to another family, where the girls are molested. To understand that case, it's important to read this book. Joyce spends time on the adoptions that don't work out, on the families who take on the mission of adoption but aren't prepared for its challenges. And because they are devoted Christians, often the only explanation for people trying to do what they see to be the right thing under God is to blame the Devil. Unfortunately, the world is much more complicated than that."}, {"userName": "Suzanne", "userReviewDate": "Jun 26, 2013", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/1381366-suzanne", "userReview": "This book certainly makes you think hard about international adoption. It's an area that seems rife with abuse, mostly in that many of the \"orphans\" adopted are not really orphans at all, and that often, parents are lied to about where their children are going, and made to think they are going to America on some kind of educational exchange. There were also fairly horrifying stories of families who adopted many children at once from Liberia or Ethiopia, and then were not able to handle the children, and either sent them back or passed them along to other families, or in some cases, used them almost like slaves.Like another book by Kathryn Joyce I read, though, this book is marred for me by being more about official policies than actual families. Joyce often seems to feel that the official stance of an agency is how all the people using the agency feel. I get the feeling she is not sometimes able to get interviews or spend time with actual families that have adopted, maybe because she is so strongly and obviously opposed to what they stand for.I appreciate books like this being written, and exposing things that need to be exposed, but I wish Joyce was a bit more balanced and a bit more flexible in her writing."}, {"userName": "Margie", "userReviewDate": "Apr 07, 2013", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/3272409-margie", "userReview": "The most comprehensive overview of the good, bad and ugly in intercountry adoption.

I have two cousins who are transracial adoptees. So I came into this book with some inherent bias. That being said, I was more than willing to give it a shot, especially since my colleague/friend Tami was singing it's praises and told me that I definitely had to give it a shot. So I immediately requested it from the library. Basically this book is a look at the Evangelical movement and it's comparatively recent obsession with adoption. The conservative Evangelical movement sees adoption as not only putting money where it's mouth is regarding it's anti-abortion stance (in a 'Well maybe we WILL adopt all the babies!' kind of way), it is also, quite frankly, indicative of the idea of spreading the word of God to as many people as possible. This book examines the consequences of this movement's love of adoption, and exposes corruption within the adoption business. And yes, it is indeed a business. Stories from Haiti, Ethiopia, South Korea, and even here in America relate tales of adoption not always being the 'win-win' situation that it has been painted to be in situations like this, and points out that more often than not these children are not 'orphans', but victims of a society that makes it very difficult for their parent or parents to keep them based on global power, misogynistic cultural norms, and the promise of Western salvation imposed upon others.Whew, right? I found myself fairly angered and frustrated as I read parts of this book. From adoption agencies in Haiti basically taking children by the droves after the 2010 Earthquake without even trying to figure out of they were indeed completely orphaned, to women in South Korea pressured to give up their babies because of their culture frowning on single motherhood (and the shaming that goes with the grief of losing their child), there are multiple horror stories that show that not all adoption agencies care about the children and their welfare, but more about the money that can be made. I was also equally disturbed by some of the stories of Evangelicals who collect children from all over the world and almost use them as props to show how NOT racist they are, or stories of adoptive parents physically abusing their adopted children for being 'willful'. Or domestic agencies trying to shame teen mothers into giving up their babies and then lying to them about how much time they have to change their minds, or, oh, having them sign things while under medication to hurry up the adoption process. Or adoptive parents who try and erase the culture their adopted children came from. OR how about the whole 'her uterus, our hearts' mantra that's been going around Evangelical adoption circles, as if a child's biological mother is nothing more than a uterus and that 'fate' had picked them to be the 'actual' parents long before the child was even born.Do I have problems with adoption? Not as a whole, not as a concept, and certainly not as a practice. On the contrary, I am very much in favor of children finding homes when they have none, and people who are unable to have biological children for whatever reason (or those like my aunt who wanted to be a mother but pregnancy isn't in the cards for other reasons) having an option to fulfill the dreams of parenthood. I'm also very much in favor of it coming about because the biological parent or parents really does honestly feel like they cannot raise this child, outside of coercion, pressure, shaming, empty promises, and fear of consequences from society or those close to them. And I really would like it if adoption agencies took their pages from the place my younger cousin was adopted through, a place that works VERY hard to make sure that the adoption is in the best interest of everyone involved. I think that one of my issues with this book was that it didn't really look at it as much from the side of the adoptive parents, and kind of downplayed the idea that they too would be capable of being hurt in some instances, say if the biological mother were to change her mind. That was almost written off as irrelevant, and while I agree that a biological mother does have the right to change her mind, I don't think it's too fair to imply that the adoptive parents pain wouldn't be as much as the biological mother's. That seemed unnecessary to me. THE CHILD CATCHERS was a difficult, but very informative read. I certainly recommend it to those who are curious about the history of adoption, and those who haven't really thought about it as a tricky issue. Because it is."}, {"userName": "Susan", "userReviewDate": "Aug 22, 2013", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/4250854-susan", "userReview": "This was a fascinating book about adoption, but an aspect of it I knew nothing about - that in very recent years evangelical Christians have massively embraced adoption as part of their mission. Churches are encouraging members to adopt, but the adopting parents (and probably the pastors themselves) are not aware of the difficult ethical issues around adoption. Many of the \"orphans\" have family members, sometimes even parents, alive. Often the issue is poverty and/or difficulty reuniting children with family in war-torn areas. I do know of several Christian groups that have begun debating some of the questions around adoption, but I did not know how strong the other side is. Adoption sounds like a good, and my guess is that most people trying to adopt are only intending to improve the situation for these children. (I assume that the one family that used their adopted children basically like servants are the exception to the rule.)Every family considering adoption, whether Christian or not, should read this book. The more we all know about the issues, the better we will be able to monitor adoptions so that only those children who truly need a home will be adopted. I would have liked more discussion on WHY adoption has become so important and rose so quickly in certain churches. Even after reading the book, I didn't get a sense of this. Obviously, money has a hand in this, but I don't believe that is the major reason. I also would have liked more exploration of how the adoptive families cope with the information that their adoptions may not have been on the up-and-up now that there is little they can do to reverse it. I know many families that have adopted from pretty much every country that was outlined in the book. Most felt they did due diligence at the time and some even met the biological families at the time of adoption, but, according to this book, there still might have been misunderstandings about the process with the bio families. How do adoptive parents deal with this emotionally while still being the parents their children now need? How do they work for improving the adoption process without their children feeling as though their adoption was a mistake."}, {"userName": "Ann", "userReviewDate": "Oct 26, 2013", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/116519-ann", "userReview": "The information in this book would be better covered in a magazine article. It seemed very long and redundant. That said, the story of adoption needed to be written. It is so tied up with what women really need, to be supported both culturally and financially. When I was young, girls who got pregnant were sent away and never saw their babies again. There were plenty of babies for those who wanted to adopt. But the 70's happened and abortion became legal so there was a real shortage of adoptable infants in this country.International adoption became prevalent, with eager parents moving from country to country as the laws and regulations changed. Unfortunately, it became very expensive and lucrative. Then the fundamentalist churches got involved and touted it as doing God's work and a ticket to heaven. Then people began creating extremely large families, often using the adoptees as servants.I am privleged to know Deann Borshay, aka Cha Jung Hee, who produced the documentary \"Third Person Plural.\"She was adopted from a Korean Orphange in 1966 and raised in Fremont, CA. But, the Borshays were given the wrong girl. It was common for mothers to leave children in orphanages for short periods of time when they couldn't afford to feed them. The girl they were expecting had been picked up the day before so the just grabbed another girl the same age and sent her to America with a new Korean and American name. After much counseling, Deann was able to find the courage to return to Korea and find her original family. I also know several very successful adoptions, both domestic and international. I hope we can enter a new era where women who want to keep their children are given the support they need to make that possible.

I came into this book wanting to be more informed about what unethical and abusive practices to look out for in the adoption industry so I could warn friends and be aware if at some point in my life I decide to adopt. I'm about halfway through, and so far what I'm getting out of it is threefold:1) Shock that what I had been told growing up in the church was simply lies. There is no shortage of adopted parents for young children, quite the opposite. Adoption is not an alternative to abortion (regardless of whether you see abortion as a medical procedure or a tragedy). There is no orphan crisis. There is a need for people to take care of older children - that's what foster care is for - but even for older children international adoption is often founded on lies.2) Rage. Rage at the racism and colonial mindset that lets supposedly Christian organizations think that lying, shaming, and using legal clout to take children from their parents. It makes me want to scream the statistics in this book from the rooftops, or at least Tumblr. 3) Liberation. This is more of a personal one, but as a queer man I also internalized somewhere along the line that it would be selfish and wrong to create new children (whether the old fashioned way or through surrogacy) because there were so many out there that needed care. The fact that isn't true is liberating - it means that if in a few years my partner(s) and I decide to parent children, we can choose how to do it. But, uh, I'm pretty sure I won't choose adoption. This book has convinced me of that."}, {"userName": "Christina", "userReviewDate": "Oct 23, 2014", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/1740420-christina", "userReview": "Entangled in the political juggernaut of reproductive rights, adoption is championed as a \u201cwin-win\u201d compromise to a woman\u2019s right to choice \u2014 abortion opponents \u201cwin\u201d as the woman has not had an abortion, pregnant women \u201cwin\u201d because they do not have to raise the fetus in question, and couples struggling with infertility \u201cwin\u201d because they can finally become parents. Yet adoption is also entangled with serious moral and ethical dilemmas \u2014 as suggested by the subtitle of Joyce\u2019s novel, \u201cRescue, Trafficking, and the New Gospel of Adoption\u201d \u2014 that are only exacerbated as the demand for adoptable orphans far outpaces supply.According to Joyce, the demand is rising because evangelical Christians are being encouraged to adopt en masse as a way to both raise up those Christian armies Joyce mentions in her previous book on the quiverfull movement and to answer the charge that anti-choice proponents care only for the fetus rather than the children already in this world. These evangelical Christians often control much of the adoption industry from the \u201ccrisis pregnancy centers\u201d that lie to women about their rights to the political lobbying groups advocating for the mass evacuation of children from Haiti following the Port-a-Prince earthquake to adoption agencies operating overseas in countries where hefty adoption fees paid by Western couples provide an economic incentive to increase the \u201csupply\u201d of adoptable children. \u201cThe Western understanding of adoption, as a total transfer of parental rights, is not a universal concept, and in many developing nations the closest analogues are traditional systems of temporary care, in which children stay with family members after a parent dies or are sent to richer acquaintances as a means of furthering their education and prospects. When international adopters come to regions that have only ever experienced these traditional forms of adoption, relinquishing parents often mistake the new adoption process for a chance for their children to get educated abroad and return better able to help the family or as a way for the family to make a connection with potential financials sponsors in the United States.\u201d (pg. 133)Thus, anyone seeking to adoption \u2014 of whatever faith and however well-meaning \u2014 is affected by the evangelical adoption movement because the movement shapes the way adoption is perceived, the language used to discuss it, the places where children are adopted from, and the laws governing the process. Rather than focusing on sustainable development or working to keep families in developing countries intact, Europeans, Americans, and Canadians channel their efforts into opening up countries to international adoptions and view themselves as heroic parents saving children from a life in poverty.Despite its rather suggestive subtitle, I found the novel to be balanced and thought-provoking examination of the adoption industry, mainly those occurring between countries rather than intra-country. Joyce masterfully argues that \u201cWestern parents are not so uniquely qualified for parenthood that any untrained couple can take on three or six or ten new adoptees and make the children\u2019s lives better than they had been before\u201d (pg. 28) through a series of case studies amidst a big picture examination of the entire adoption industry. She explains how some parents are not equipped to raise children from another culture who may be traumatized from war, being institutionalized, abuse, or other causes that brought them into adoption and thus \u201crehome\u201d their adopted children either by finding them another family or returning them to their birth country.This problem is not tracked by any organization in the United States, but it is the stated reason as to why Russia closed their international adoption program. Other countries like the Ukraine and Rwanda shut down their adoption programs following a string of abuses, mainly children being presented as orphans when they have parents or families willing to care for them. The Ukraine launched a program to encourage domestic adoption and saw the number of international adoptions plummet as a result. The only children remaining within the orphanages were those with birth defects or other special needs that are at the bottom of the adoption \u201cwish list\u201d creating an issue where demand far exceeds supply, although I hate to apply such terms to children.The only way to increase the supply is to take advantage of uneducated parents, to move onto a newly opened country before regulations can be established, and to advocate for the United States and other governments to remain pro-adoption despite documented abuses and problems. The complexity of these issues are well-research and presented in such a way that I never became lost or bogged down in the intricacies of an international issue. Joyce\u2019s book is, frankly, a terrifyingly sobering read and one I would encourage anyone considering adoption \u2014 or, to be honest, anyone who cares about children, period \u2014 to read."}, {"userName": "Kris Pryde", "userReviewDate": "Jun 24, 2013", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/13534012-kris-pryde", "userReview": "Joyce brings to light the plethora of illegal and unethical practices that occur when adoption is treated as a big business. She does a particularly good job framing adoption as a largely ignored feminist issue and something that should be a larger part of the reproductive debate and discussion on the role of women in societies. She also breaks the myth of adoption as philanthropy, which it is decidedly NOT. It is an important life decision that affects the adoptee, adoptive parent(s), birth parent(s), their extended families, their communities, and their countries. It is an industry that is often poorly understood, with only a handful of people shaping the narrative. For those with no previous education on these issues, some of the stories and abuses could be extremely disturbing to you. Lean in to the discomfort, as it's how we learn to do better.The larger purpose of the book was clearly to understand the business of adoption (mostly international adoptions) and where it goes wrong. She succeeds most admirably in this. It might have also been helpful to offer more alternatives or solutions to how improvements can be made to the adoption system, which tends to heavily prioritize the needs of Western adoptive parents over adoptees or birth parents. I wish she had included more of the adoptee perspective as well, but they do get peppered in as appropriate. I also hoped for more hard statistics on the scope of the problems she presents, as anecdotal stories do not comprise the whole picture. Honestly though, I imagine that kind of information is difficult to aggregate.Understandably, the stories she highlights tend to have more sensational elements to them (though she presents them without it feeling exploitative). I question the universality of some of the stories of adoptees and their adoptive families (I do not question their validity). I see why they were included anyway, as they are the kind of stories that make you want to throw the book against the wall in disgust and then run and pick it back up so you can keep reading. However, I think she offers significant understanding of the wheels that keep everything turning in the adoption business, how Western desires create demand and unethical supply, and she explores the systematic abuse and erasure of birth mothers/parents/families.Overall, this is a great book on the exploitations and abuses of the adoption industry from a journalistic perspective. I think she offers a balanced view of a complex issue and tries hard to accurately capture the intent of organizations and individuals. In particular, I think she fairly observes the strengths and weaknesses of the evangelical church in relation to their actions and beliefs surrounding adoption. Joyce also provides her own very solid insights. She has a particular point to make and I think she is quite successful in doing so. The book was well researched, well written, and very much needed.

The next person who blithely suggests how great adoption is, and how selfish women are who chose abortion, will undoubtedly receive a recommendation to read this book.The book starts by questioning the ethics of unregulated international adoptions - situations where children who have living parents or relatives who may want to care for them may be \"rescued\" to \"better lives\" with coincidentally rich, white American families - and continues on from there. It details the supply chain (American Christians' demand for \"orphans\" far outpacing the actual \"stock\" of existing orphans) and how international adoption - couched in \"savior\" rhetoric - nearly always trumps the needs of existing poor families, and even the needs of the children themselves. Coerced adoptions, baby snatching, paternal rights illegally terminated, the eternal religious trump card, and baby profiteering are laid out with convincing evidence of each. Reading about adoptions from Ethiopia, which I have observed happen from this end, reinforced the validity of the criticisms. Joyce is not making this stuff up; it is happening right now. The end of the book focuses on Rwanda in particular, along with other groups who are engaging in ACTUAL child-centered orphan care. The case for family first, domestic adoption second, and international adoption as a last-resort is clearly laid out, and policies which protect children and families from becoming commodities are highlighted.

At the same time, the author is relentlessly negative about international adoption, and the religious organizations which promote it. She's certainly got some egregiously awful abuses documented here. But if she quotes a source critical of adoption, she often doesn't use quotation marks, just launches right into it like a statement of fact, with the attribution buried at the end and an account of how that source also rolled their eyes, or shrugged helplessly at the newest outrage by members of whatever church. Neutral statements become inflammatory. She is horrified by everything--the current use of the term birth parent (feel free to suggest an alternative), the participation of adoption agencies in developing regulations for adoption--I work in medicine: as a parallel, physicians and nurses, as folks with knowledge of and commitment to healthcare, might be expected to be involved in its regulation--but to her this is only foxes in the henhouse.

Having worked on international research in this area (the children, not adoption) it was eye-opening to see some of the trafficking/commodity aspect of decidedly needy kids. The misconception that we can \"rescue\" kids by shipping them out of their home countries and that there are millions to be rescued is so common. Very, very few kids in our research were double orphans with no family. Most were simply from families that were poor and saw educational and respite care opportunities by placing their kids in temporary situations. In the US historically and South Korea currently, issues of stigma and sexism create adoptable children that women often would prefer to keep if more social support were available.

There aren't many books that make you reconsider everything you thought you knew about an entire topic, but this was one of those books for me. There were times I had to set it down for a few days and wrestle with what I'd read. If you want to adopt or if you are an adoption advocate, then I would encourage you to read this book. Here's why. In my corner of the world, adoption has always been presented as THE answer to abortion. It is the ideal solution for all parties, the one that preserves a life and fills a need for families longing for children. It is a way to show compassion for mothers who are struggling, who can't keep their children but don't see any other solution. I still believe those things. But now, I see an entirely new layer of complexity to the adoption solution. One that is disturbing in many ways. One that needs an answer. I won't attempt to recap the entire book. It would take more space than I have in this limited review. But because I move in evangelical circles, I'll talk just briefly about Joyce's discussion of the evangelical adoption movement. Joyce presents her research in the context of stories--brief vignettes that introduce us to the people of adoption. Sometimes birth parents, sometimes adoptive parents, and sometimes adopted children. One of those stories followed the experience of a young girl, pregnant out of wedlock, who found herself at a crisis pregnancy center. The story she told was not one of compassion, counsel, and the gospel. Instead, the center pressured and manipulated her into giving up her child, did not fully inform her of her legal rights or give legal representation, and cut her off from her child's adoptive family once the papers were signed. This same story replayed itself again and again with the same ugly details--how the end goal of the center was getting a baby for adoption rather than offering hope to the mother. How staff members used misleading, manipulative and even deceptive methods to ensure that desired outcome. Joyce describes the evangelical community's presentation of adoption as a gospel mandate (I am very familiar with this idea), and suggests that this view of adoption creates a demand for adoptable children that is often filled in unscrupulous ways, both for domestic and international adoptions. It's disturbing. And it deserves consideration. Here's the thing. I believe that we (and by we I mean the community of Christian adoption advocates) have taken a real and pressing need--the need to care for orphans and widows, the need to find an alternative to abortion--and advocated it in ways that do not always, in fact, act in the best interests of children and mothers. I realize this is a strong statement to make and that there are two sides to every story. Still, I think that the gospel requires us to step outside our limited world view and see people as individuals, not problems to be solved. Not projects. Joyce's book is full of startling stories and statements about adoption--the corruption, the mismanagement, and the outright deception that leads to adoption tragedies. It's worth your time. I still believe adoption is important. It's beautiful. The adoptive families I know are strong, loving people who have no greater desire than to be moms and dads and love their children. This review is in no way intended to attack the idea of adoption or the individual adoption story of any family. But I think that we (Christian or not) would be wise to step back and ask whether the adoption movement as it stands today is the best way to approach the need. We should examine our motives and ask whether we truly want what's best for that individual child. And we should be willing to recognize where we have misstepped so that we can correct our mistakes. That's the only way we can truly meet the genuine needs around us. Caveat: I'm giving this book four stars for two reasons. First, despite her excellent research, I can't agree with Joyce's support of abortion as a viable option. There are too many lives at stake. And despite misguided and even overtly deceptive actions at times, at its heart, the evangelical adoption movement still wants to find a better way to help women and children. I think Joyce's representation of the movement was biased because she fundamentally disagrees with its premise--that abortion is wrong, life matters, and people need the gospel.Second, I don't think she presented the positive side of adoption fairly. She digs deep into the corruption and shares many failed adoption stories, but she doesn't acknowledge the times when adoption meets a genuine need in a beautiful way. Christian or not, many adoptive parents just want to give kids a loving home and many kids need loving parents. Those stories need to be told as well."}, {"userName": "Caroline Kirchner", "userReviewDate": "Jun 24, 2013", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/12559526-caroline-kirchner", "userReview": "Best review is from my daughters' blog who also read this book over the summer whole in Africa. I love God.I love babies.I love adoption.I love missions.Now that everyone\u2019s clear on all that\u2026 I read a very controversial book this summer while I was in Africa called The Child Catchers, which shook my world a little bit. It is a depiction of adoption that I had never heard or thought about before. It tells story after story of children being taken from their homes, from their families, to be sent to western countries to satisfy the demand for adoptable children, known as the \u201cadoption industry.\u201d In some of these stories the children\u2019s parents were told their children would just be going to the USA to get an education and then they would return home. In others, the culture that the children were taken from had no concept of the permanency of adoption that our culture has so they just didn\u2019t realize that their children were never coming back. The book also tells stories of adoptive families who are told their adoptive child was an orphan with no parents or family whatsoever only to discover later that the child still has one or even two parents still living and wanting their child back. In some cases, adoption agencies didn\u2019t even attempt to find a child\u2019s biological family before approving him or her for adoption, and due to the high amount of money the agency would receive for each child adopted, the book goes so far as to refer to this as child trafficking! Woah! While that idea sinks in for a minute, let me switch gears. While reading all this stuff about adoption, a practice I\u2019d always thought to be pretty much an unqualified good, I was also wrestling with and talking to many people about the concept of short term missions. This is a concept I\u2019ve been grappling with since my first visit to Uganda in 2008 when I first heard the concept that short term missions, another practice I had pretty much viewed as unqualified good, could actually be harmful. I saw this first hand that summer when I heard that the kiddos at the orphanage where we were working think that white people love them (because they played with them and brought them presents and candy and stickers), but the Ugandan people who work at the orphanage don\u2019t because they are busy cooking their food and doing their laundry and preparing lessons for the kids. That is an incorrect and even harmful mindset. I saw this again this summer when we were working in a baby house where they have previously had to ask teams not to come work there anymore because the babies were forming unhealthy attachment issues due to short term teams coming, bonding, and going home\u2026leaving the babies struggling with who they were supposed to be attached to or detached from. The issues aren\u2019t only in how the babies think, but in adult mindsets as well as many Ugandans seem to have a sense of learned helplessness and think that they cannot help themselves, but instead need white people to come fix the problems or simply give them the necessary money to do so. And what about the manual labor projects I\u2019ve done on such trips? It sounds awful to say, but maybe I\u2019m actually taking jobs away from locals who could have earned a fair wage for doing that same job (probably better than I could have done it to begin with)! Nooooooooooooooooooooooo!!!! How could good, Godly things like adoption and missions get so screwed up? Well, I guess it stands to reason that if something is good and Godly, it\u2019s going to make Satan mad and he\u2019s going to try to attack it as best he can. And boy is he! But we serve a God who is greater than he who is in the world and what a relief that has been to my troubled heart as I\u2019ve wrestled with this over this past summer! Yes, even good things like adoption and missions, when put into human hands and attacked by satan, get corrupted and tainted. BUT, God can redeem anything and make all things new. So, in light of rampant corruption AND the goodness of God, how do I proceed? Here\u2019s the bottom line: I don\u2019t think God wants us to stop adopting or going on mission trips; we just need to use our God given minds and walk in the light in a smart and alert manner. I think that short term trips can be extremely beneficial for the person going as well as for the person receiving help if it is done the right way. If someone goes in with specialized skills or funds of knowledge that would otherwise be very hard to get in that country, that is extremely beneficial (for example, doctors or dentists doing mobile clinics, teachers teaching missionary kids so they don\u2019t have to go to a far away boarding school, church leaders planting churches in cooperation with a local church or doing pastoral training, financial minds creating micro-finance programs, photographers and videographers photographing or filming for a missions organization\u2026there are an unlimited amount of specialized skills that can be put to good use). I also think that it\u2019s extremely important to attempt to research and understand the culture and cultural values we are entering into so that we can focus on the things that would be helpful in that culture. There are many ways we could provide what we think people want or need when really it is just what we would want or think we would need were we in that situation. Just because a family has a dirt floor or has no electricity or running water or has no mattress to sleep on or doesn\u2019t earn what we deem to be \u201cenough\u201d money from our viewpoint\u2026that doesn\u2019t mean that that family needs us to give them any of those things. Just because we build them a solar dehydrator to improve the way they can save and store food for their family\u2026that doesn\u2019t mean it\u2019s actually going to be put to use once we leave if it isn\u2019t a part of their culture. Just because they live a different lifestyle than we do, doesn\u2019t mean we should try to create a mini version of our life in that culture. I don\u2019t think we intend to do this, but I have seen this happen over and over and been guilty of it myself. We need to use our minds to research and talk to others and partner with missionaries and locals who live in that place and that culture and do our utmost to make sure that what we are doing is indeed helpful there. I love playing with and cuddling the kids in Uganda when I am there, but I need to make sure that where I am and what I am doing is actually helping and definitely not hurting those precious kids who are far too accustomed to being left behind. If I don\u2019t, it becomes more about my emotional fulfillment then the needs of those beautiful kids\u2026and that\u2019s certainly not what I want. In the same way, adoption is such a beautiful gift for all involved and incredibly pleasing to God as long as we walk into it alert, again using our God given minds to make sure that we are not contributing to any sort of corruptive practice or taking a child away from their family. So, in light of this summer of thinking and wrestling and learning, I challenge you to do this with me: walk into the light\u2026with eyes wide open and mind alert as we attempt to bring some piece of Heaven to this imperfect and messed up earth. Lets love with our hearts AND minds. As I struggled with figuring out how to love smartly this summer, I came across this quote from Jedd Medefind who wrote a critique of The Child Catchers that brought me hope that this \u201cloving smartly thing\u201d can be done, and I will leave you with his words:\u201cWe must do two seemingly opposite things at once: relentlessly pursue the highest ideals\u2026while also knowing that the situations we enter and the results we achieve will often be far less than ideal.Knowing this guides us past cynicism, despair and the temptation to withdraw. It permits us to give ourselves wholeheartedly to children, even when we know the outcomes we seek for them will always be alloyed. Most of all, it frees us to love freely\u2026even as we have been freely loved.\u201d http://ugandalovethis.wordpress.com/"}], "description": "When Jessie Hawkins\u2019 adopted daughter told her she had another mom back in Ethiopia, Jessie didn\u2019t, at first, know what to think. She\u2019d wanted her adoption to be great story about a child who needed a home and got one, and a family led by God to adopt. Instead, she felt like she\u2019d done something wrong.Adoption has long been enmeshed in the politics of reproductive rights, pitched as a \u201cwin-win\u201d compromise in the never-ending abortion debate. But as Kathryn Joyce makes clear in The Child Catchers, adoption has lately become even more entangled in the conservative Christian agenda.To tens of millions of evangelicals, adoption is a new front in the culture wars: a test of \u201cpro-life\u201d bona fides, a way for born again Christians to reinvent compassionate conservatism on the global stage, and a means to fulfill the \u201cGreat Commission\u201d mandate to evangelize the nations. Influential leaders fervently promote a new \u201corphan theology,\u201d urging followers to adopt en masse, with little thought for the families these \u201corphans\u201d may already have.Conservative evangelicals control much of that industry through an infrastructure of adoption agencies, ministries, political lobbying groups, and publicly-supported \u201ccrisis pregnancy centers,\u201d which convince women not just to \u201cchoose life,\u201d but to choose adoption. Overseas, conservative Christians preside over a spiraling boom-bust adoption market in countries where people are poor and regulations weak, and where hefty adoption fees provide lots of incentive to increase the \u201csupply\u201d of adoptable children, recruiting \u201corphans\u201d from intact but vulnerable families.The Child Catchers is a shocking expos\u00e9 of what the adoption industry has become and how it got there, told through deep investigative reporting and the heartbreaking stories of individuals who became collateral damage in a market driven by profit and, now, pulpit command.Anyone who seeks to adopt\u2014of whatever faith or no faith, and however well-meaning\u2014is affected by the evangelical adoption movement, whether they know it or not. The movement has shaped the way we think about adoption, the language we use to discuss it, the places we seek to adopt from, and the policies and laws that govern the process.
