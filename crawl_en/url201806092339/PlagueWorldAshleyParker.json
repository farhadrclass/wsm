This continues on from where Plague Nation ended, and Ashley and her band of merry-men are fighting their way across America to find Gabriel, who was taken by the bad guys. He could also hold the cure to the virus that is now spreading across the world.As usual there is quite a lot of action, but I felt as though not a lot actually happens. Sadly the pacing did fluctuate, and I found myself getting a bit bored in places. For the book just to be about Ashley trying to find Gabriel, meant that it didn\u2019t quite have the same amount of excitement as the previous two books. I feel that if Gabriel\u2019s side of the story was interwoven with Ashley\u2019s story, it would have given the book a better dynamic, broken the story up a bit, making it a more fast-paced read. Gabriel\u2019s condition is an interesting one and it was a shame that we couldn\u2019t have seen what he was going through while Ashley was trying to find him.As mentioned, there is no appearance of Gabriel, until 30 pages before the end of the book. I will admit that this annoyed me quite a bit as the series started out with Gabriel being part of the main storyline, as well as Ashley\u2019s love interest, which I really liked. I enjoyed having the romance aspect mixed with the darkness of the zombie apocalypse, so to not have Gabriel in for basically the entire book made me feel a little bit cheated.Thankfully, Ashley\u2019s snarky nature is still present. She\u2019s funny without being annoying, and although the situation is dire, her humour breaks up the seriousness of what is going on around them. Fredsti manages to combine humour and horror very well and I really enjoy that aspect of her writing.In this instalment, the virus has become airborne, but sometimes it didn\u2019t really make sense. As well as the Wild Cards (those who are immune to the zombie bite), there is also TJ, who is a civilian. He goes out with the Wild Cards, but doesn\u2019t wear a protective mask. Is the now mutated virus, which has gone airborne, only contagious from human to human when it shows itself as the flu? Once it kills the humans and they come back as a zombie is the virus not airborne anymore? How long can it survive while its airborne? Once people turn into zombies does it return to it\u2019s previous state of only being transmitted through bites and blood? Too many questions\u2026The story of Ashley and the other Wild Cards is interjected with snippets of the outside world, and focuses on an individual or couple and their experiences, and we get to see what\u2019s going on through their eyes. Some of these mini stories were good as the ending is wrapped up, but some were left hanging and all I could think was, what happened to so and so? Although generally these stories were interesting, I also found them to be slightly distracting to the overall story. In all honesty I could have done without them, and would have preferred snippets of what Gabriel was going through instead.When we do finally meet up with Gabriel again, it is very close to the end of the book, and it is bitterly disappointing. I DID NOT like what happened to him, and felt as though it was an easy way out, rather than expanding on his condition of half human, half zombie. It was a real shame this part of the story wasn\u2019t fully developed, as it was one of the most exciting aspects to the overall story, and to Gabriel\u2019s character.I did enjoy this final instalment, but not as much as the first two books, and I didn\u2019t like the way it ended \u2013 heartbroken doesn\u2019t cover it. The ending, however, didn\u2019t really feel like a conclusion, as the zombie apocalypse continues, but it did give me hope that maybe one day, Fredsti will bring back Ashley Parker."}, {"userName": "Kristin  (MyBookishWays Reviews)", "userReviewDate": "Aug 25, 2014", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/3491365-kristin-mybookishways-reviews", "userReview": "http://www.mybookishways.com/2014/08/...Ashley Parker has been dealing with, and battling, the plague, and the zombies they spawned, like a champ, and Plague Nation was especially harrowing for Ashley and the gang. There was a helicopter crash, an ambush, and perhaps the worst part for Ashley, Gabriel was captured at gunpoint. He and Ashley were just starting to explore their new relationship, and the possibility of a way to control his condition. Needless to say, Ashley is desperate to get him back. To make things even worse, Dr. Albert was taken by the same people, and the possibility of a vaccine for Walker\u2019s Flu lies with him. The current incarnation of the vaccine can actually cause people to become the walking dead, but it\u2019s a starting point for a cure, and now that the virus has become airborne, it\u2019s more important than ever before that they recover Dr. Albert. Luckily, Ashley is a Wild Card (she\u2019s immune to the zombie virus and after she contracted it and fought it, she came out of it with some pretty awesome \u201cheightened\u201d abilities), and most of her team are Wild Cards as well. Now, they must make their way to San Diego to hopefully rescue Dr. Albert, for them to have any hope for a cure to a disease that has now spread throughout the world.Ashley is back in all her snarky glory, but in Plague World, although she hasn\u2019t lost her considerable sense of humor, she\u2019s a more subdued, introspective Ashley than she was in previous books. She misses Gabriel, she worries that Lil will just get worse without medication, so finding appropriate meds is a priority, and the new guy, Griff, seems determined to get his hands on Ashley, whether she consents or not, and she doesn\u2019t trust him. He\u2019s got some kind of angle, and she\u2019s certain it\u2019s more than just getting in her pants. So, the team is off to San Diego to find out who is at the bottom of unleashing Walker\u2019s Flu and perverted the DZN\u2019s (Dolofonoitou Zontanous Nekrous, or \u201ckillers of the dead\u201d) existence for their own nefarious means.Plague World is the 3rd and last in Dana Fredsti\u2019s smashing zombie series, and although it\u2019s a bit bittersweet, she brings things to a satisfying conclusion and the journey to get there is horrific, sometimes funny, and always awesome. Most of the story is told by Ashley, but in Plague World, there are interludes that take place in different parts of the world where the plague is just taking hold, and it serves to heighten the terror of an already awful situation. Fredsti has a lot of fun with her use of San Diego\u2019s Balboa Park, which is a former naval based turned national park, and as always, her fight scenes are fantastic. Give Ashley a sword, and she\u2019ll cut a swath through the undead that\u2019s a mile long, and as gruesomely gleeful as some of the fight scenes are, the body count is taking its toll on Ashley and the rest of the group, especially after the considerable losses they\u2019ve suffered.This book is darker than the previous two, and it doesn\u2019t get much darker than in the final pages, when Ashley comes face to face with a person from her past. I don\u2019t want to give anything away, but suffice it to say that Ashley is taken to a very, very dark place, and the experience would cause many to lose their minds. Yeah, it\u2019s that bad. Dana Fredsti is a fantastic storyteller-you\u2019ll blaze through this in one or two sittings, because the action rarely lets up, and it\u2019s just good. If you\u2019re a zombie fan, or just a fan of spectacular horror, this should be a go-to series, and I envy anyone that gets to read this series back to back. Plague World was worth the wait, though, and I\u2019ll follow Dana Fredsti anywhere. I\u2019m very much looking forward to what she\u2019s got in the works next."}, {"userName": "Jennifer (Bad Bird Reads)", "userReviewDate": "Apr 12, 2015", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/6864850-jennifer-bad-bird-reads", "userReview": "http://badbirdreads.com/review-plague...At A GlanceSeriously, that\u2019s the end of the series? WTF?The GoodIt started out good. The action took time to get going but it\u2019s as gruesome and heartbreaking as ever. The group is on a mission to save Gabriel, Ashley\u2019s boyfriend, and some others from their group who got kidnapped by the bad guys who want the zombie apocalypse to continue. Ash and the crew are trying to find a cure, but everyone wants to get in their way. So, the adventures begin and we meet a lot of interesting people while facing hordes of zombies and assholes. The best part of the book was the side stories about random people and their stories from when the zombies first started showing up. Now those are interesting. Plus, the humor is great, though it got a bit annoying sometimes.The BadI was going to give this book 3 stars until I found out it was the end of the series. Nothing was resolved and very few questions were answered. Plus, I have four things that I HATE in books, and Plague World did one (almost two) of those things. What\u2019s even worse, I didn\u2019t even care that this thing happened, because I didn\u2019t care about a certain character anymore.A lot of the people we have come to love died for no reason by the end. This did not feel like a wrap up to a series at all. Never even crossed my mind that it was the last book until I looked on Goodreads five minutes after finishing the book. Then I flipped! The ending to this book can be equated to ending Citizen Kane with him sitting down to eat dinner. WTF??? No cure and no happy ending. Just blah.Oh yeah, and thanks for giving us Griff, who is either a rapist, murder, hero, love-interest, or maybe he just gives zero fucks. I don\u2019t know and honestly, I don\u2019t even care anymore. And we get almost no explanation for his actions through the novel.The SnugglyNo sex and really no relationship stuff either.Final ThoughtsI liked the first two books of the trilogy. It has an urban fantasy feel and lots of yucky zombies. Win-win, right? Wrong. Not with how it all ended. It\u2019s just plain stupid and I am pissed. However, if the author decided to continue the series and actually give a good series an appropriate ending, I would read it. Not recommended.QuotesThen it hit me. A quick pat down confirmed that not only was my katana gone, but I was also missing my M4 and my squirrel gun. Griff had either overlooked or decided to leave me with my tanto and my Ruger. The arming equivalent of a pity fuck."}, {"userName": "Jackie", "userReviewDate": "Apr 17, 2014", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/2195441-jackie", "userReview": "Not a good idea to read this one without reading book 1 Plague Town and book 2 Plague Nation first.

Author Dana Fredsti just keeps delivering the goods with Ashley Parker and her zombie-stomping crew in PLAGUE WORLD, the third and final book in the Plague trilogy. A bit darker in tone but still full of wit and action, this book is the pinnacle of the collection, and I\u2019m very pleased with out things turn out.Ashley Parker is touted as \u201cBuffy meets The Walking Dead\u201d, and that is an excellent way to describe these books. As a fan of both Buffy and Walking, I am thrilled to have a series that sort of throws them together.As with the previous books, PLAGUE WORLD is written well and flows perfectly. Fredsti\u2019s writing is swift and concise, which allows for a deeper immersion into the story. This gives a greater enjoyment factor when the action scenes come along.And there\u2019s plenty of action to go around. The fight scenes are intense, and the zombie-killing is plentiful. I particularly like how Fredsti puts the reader right in the thick of things as the terrifying events unfold. Her zombies are actually scary, and there\u2019s a real sense of threat in the air as you tear through each page.The characters in PLAGUE WORLD are once again crisp and real, another primary reason this series is so good. There are those you love and those you hate, but one thing is for sure: each one will leave a lasting imprint in your brain throughout the book.PLAGUE WORLD is an epic conclusion to an excellent series, and I highly recommend giving it a read. If you\u2019ve never read any of this series, I suggest starting today with book one (PLAGUE TOWN) and binge-reading the whole trilogy. If you\u2019re a fan of horror and/or zombies, you won\u2019t be disappointed."}, {"userName": "Loren", "userReviewDate": "Oct 20, 2014", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/286958-loren", "userReview": "I loved the first two books of this series, but I have to take a star off because this book didn't end as much as stop. I will read however many books follow this one, but I was expecting the series to end as a trilogy. The surprise was hard to take.Dana did a great job in this book with the side characters, particularly the Harajuku girls trapped in a shop in Tokyo (it's like they were written just for me!) and the ex-Special Forces motorcycle \"club.\" I would love to read spin-off stories about them.The character Griff was problematic for me, though. The scene where he corners Ashley in a corridor was triggery for me. While he later justifies his behavior and she forgives him, I could not. The creep factor was just too high.Which actually was one of the things I liked about the book: just because the zombocalypse is going on, men don't stop playing \"games\" with women. Ashley can and does hold her own, but it's good to see that that world reflecting our own so clearly.There were nit-picky things that struck me: the BDSM girl in the pub is wearing a high leather collar just before the zombies tear out her throat. Ashley & crew go out of their way to bust into a Walgreens when there's a hospital pharmacy in UCSF, directly across the street from the zombie lab. The lead-up to the San Diego Zoo really got my hopes up that there would be tigers mauling zombies, but Ashley gets cold-cocked and misses out of the whole thing.Still, the excitement level remains high, the pace is fast, and the zombies disgusting. I guess I'm glad that I don't have to leave this world just yet, while stories remain to be told there."}, {"userName": "Jen", "userReviewDate": "Sep 03, 2014", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/1669380-jen", "userReview": "A zombie book with hearts, guts, brains and humor, \u201cPlague World\u201d is a must read for any and all zombie fans! There were ups and downs (and oh, the downs really, really got to me) and plenty of thrills. There was tons of action, just a touch of romance and more chills than you can count! The ending was....difficult. Difficult both because of the fact that the series is over and because of certain events. However, it was not gratuitously difficult, what happened really felt as if it needed to happen. So, even though I was saddened, I felt as if the story went where it had to go. And, on the not depressing side, the geek references rocked! I consider myself a card carrying geek and I'm still not sure I got all of the references (\u201cgoing to need a bigger boat\u201d; \u201ccan't stop the signal Mal\u201d; \u201carguing over who was the best Doctor\u201d; and many, many more \u2013 don't want to give too many away, that takes the fun out of finding them!).

This book definitely was a lot more intense than the previous two books as the stakes are much higher for everyone. The whole world is now in jeopardy as everyone has to deal with the zombie outbreak in a way that\u2019s unexpected.Ashely and the rest of the wild cards have a lot to deal with. Not to mention that they have so many unknown variables as to why would someone unleash this plague purposely. This person is the most dangerous person in the world at the moment. We don\u2019t know who is doing this or their motivations and that makes for one scary enemy. Also as we go through this book that we find some of the wild cards are coping with their issues a lot more effectively than others.Lili is the one that Ashley worries about the most. Lili acts like she is in her own world and has her reasons. Plus her meds are starting to make her even a little bit lets unsay unbalanced. Having an unbalanced wild card could make things a lot worse. So Ashley and the rest of the wild cards try to find Lil meds from other places knowing that they will have to deal with zombies trying to get her meds. This proves very dangerous indeed.The newest wild card is always doing something to make Ashley uncomfortable with the way he acts. He is also kind of sleazy. Always trying to put the moves on her. He is a bit of a douchebag in my opinion because Ashley is trying to save the people she loves from a very bad fate. We also learn that Griff acts the way he does for certain reasons, but they are not clear at first.Then there is a traitor in the group we find out that has been feeding them information about their missions and what they are up to. It really is scary to think that this person is risking everything for some weird reason. We later find out that the traitor is the last person you would ever expect. We do find through some intense action scenes who their enemy is and why they are doing this. It\u2019s really scary to think that this man\u2019s delusions and the reasons for it kind of make sense, but still what he has unleashed is definitely not good.This book had some of the craziest scenes and moments that I\u2019ve ever seen in a zombie book.

So I settled down in bed early with the aircon going, hoping to read this in one go and get some resolution. I read it, but there was very little resolution! Watch out people, there will be spoilers in this one because I have to write my thoughts out. Can I just say that having Griff basically begin sexually assaulting the main character Ashley to then becoming 'one of the gang' to finally betrayer but has to hang around anyway was just TERRIBLE. Like seriously, he should have been chomped by the very next horde, instead it felt like he was meant to be 'interesting' and I kind of felt like the author was going into love interest territory? NO NO NO.Oh and we get the start of chapters from people all over the world, some of whom are wild cards. Did any of this go anywhere, or even have a point? NO. I assumed it was there to say that these wild cards would go on to save humanity, blah blah, but there was no point, except to say that the disease was spreading. WHICH COULD HAVE BEEN DONE WITHOUT ANY OF THIS. Why give me Japanese girls surviving Walker's and chopping up zombies with a katana and then take it away?! cruel.Final book, means things should be wrapped up in a neat little package. NO. We get the death of a character I expected to die, and then, what, lunch? A reunion? Guess we've done the best we can on the whole 'cure' for Walker's? (which annoyed me, that Ashley spends the book calling it a cure and getting people's hopes up. If she called it a vaccine it might have made more sense, because you can't cure the zombies. They're dead.)So yeah. Probably one of the most disappointing ends to a series that started with such promise that I've read in a long time. Zombies still scare the hell out of me (as witnessed by my boyfriend last night. I was dreaming, and somehow came to the conclusion he was lying next to me turning into a zombie. The second he moved in reality, I jumped out of bed and stood there like an idiot, blinking away sleep. It was only when he spoke that I realized I had been dreaming, but hey, quick reflexes!) Two stars :("}, {"userName": "Brian Manville", "userReviewDate": "Nov 30, 2014", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/23608204-brian-manville", "userReview": "A sad fact of modern culture is that everything has to run in threes...or until the franchise stops making money. It has become part of the zombie sub-culture as well. Dana Fredsti has written the third part of her Ashley Parker trilogy (I assume) and picks up right where Plague Nation left off - in San Francisco among boatloads of zombies. The bad news is that Ashley's boyfriend has been spirited off to parts unknown. The worse news is that the virus has gone airborne, meaning the humans on planet earth are in the process of being counted out.There are the usual zombie antics - unexpected turns, unusual characters and lots and lots of pop culture references. In fact, I will say that Ashley Parker could've used more smart aleck and a whole lot less Wired/Nerdist references. And if I read the 10,001st reference to \"Thor's Wee Hammer\", I was seriously going to riot. Installment #3 isn't much different than its preceding books; it's telling the same story of zombie contagion, zombie killing, BIG CONSPIRACY and drama in the race to find a cure. The problem is that Ashley's family doctor is working on a cure, and based off the interludes (in italics), there aren't going to be many humans left to inoculate - that is, if you can find them. There is this sense of urgency that is sort of misapplied -- I mean, what's the hurry now? Closing the barn door doesn't bring the horse back.The book is to be commended for the fight scenes - they are well written and quite descriptive. And, just in case you needed a SAW fix since they're not making those movies anymore, we get a little torture porn. I will say that it is graphic and will also admit to being creeped out by it. Yet, even in this situation when Fredesti is seeking to give you some horror, she *just* can't resist making a pop culture reference that causes the tortured to laugh (albeit slightly). *sigh* Mood: RUINED. Still, the fact that the book ends with a loose end or two is commendable, as well as the Epilogue which is the last interlude but one that gives you a sense of optimism that humanity may rise again.BOTTOM LINE: A good pulp horror read; nothing more, nothing less."}, {"userName": "artemis", "userReviewDate": "Aug 29, 2015", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/46425923-artemis", "userReview": "I finished the series and up until this book I legit felt like Turk making the 'I Don't Know' sound. Usually timelines don't bother me but that's probably cause all the books I've read have been good so far. This one... uh the timeline was messy. The author clearly tried to make jokes that were relevant at the time. \"You gonna tell someone about Mister Fifty Shades of Asshat?\" I researched this so dont judge me but that series didnt even get popular until 2012 and its assumed that the whole series takes place in 2011 september-october. i'm sorry that i know that fact. \"He take Sharknado(...)\" Sharknado came out in 2013 (i watched the movie oh lord). Then that part of the book where JT 'twerked like Miley Cyrus' bruh white people didnt even find out about 'twerking' until 2013 lmaoooo. anyways, a timeline needs to be consistent or else nobody is gonna believe your story or characters. Lilly's bipolar disorder came in the second book and came out of no where like... what. And when Ashley left Lilly that was ooc cause Ashley is like a big sister to Lilly and loves her to death so that was ? Gabriel's death didn't hit me. I mean there was no point of him so bye gabriel.The first book was fine, I mean it was funny and had plot.Second book was just nothing and not even memorable. All I remember from book 2 is that Kai died and I'm still lowkey upset. he was legit the only poc in the entirety of the book that appeared more than twice.Third book was a mess, nothing happened until the last 80 fuckin pages. Anyways, the whole series is a 2.5 (.5 for the first book) I lowkey wish the person that recommended this series didn't recommend it cause it was messy especially the last book. This a fucked review cause im writing this on my phone and my family and i are heading to Banff lmao. Just saying, anyone that gives this book a higher rating than 3 stars is lying to themselves."}], "description": "The thrilling conclusion of the zombie apocalypse begun in PLAGUE TOWN and continued in PLAGUE NATION!
