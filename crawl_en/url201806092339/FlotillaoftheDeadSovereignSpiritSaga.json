Love all the characters & how they developed throughout the second book. There are some new players being introduced including some women that are not just in the back ground being helpless wives & girlfriends & thats great after all not only men fight zombies.There are some real nail biting chapters that you just cant read fast enough in order to see what happens, by far the most dramatic part was the drive through the city to get to the safe haven, smart & clever.At the end of the book you just want to keep reading its almost a shame to have to wait for book 3 but im sure it'll be worth the wait.Well done on creating a fresh & clever zombie series for once the survivors use their brains & band together to help each other & stay alive a thinking persons zombie world not just death & survivors killing each other but trying to re-build their lives & trying to think ahead of what the future could be like if everyone works together."}, {"userName": "Faye, la Patata", "userReviewDate": "Apr 15, 2012", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/7650833-faye-la-patata", "userReview": "I was honestly very surprised. I had very high expectations of the second installment after reading the first book, but I have to say that it went far beyond my expectations. It was a FANTASTIC read!! I had a lot of instances where I felt my heart about to burst from excitement, anger, and happiness for the characters. The writing was even better than the first book. Mister David Forsyth, you have written a masterpiece! The book only left me hungry for more. It was a long read, but I truly wished it was longer. When the two main characters teamed up to defeat the horde of zombies, I felt as if I was with them as well, cheering and whistling with pride. Sigh! The foreshadowing of future events that may take place in the third book has left me wanting more. I hope the third book is on its way!!"}, {"userName": "Randy Harmelink", "userReviewDate": "Apr 03, 2012", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/2029520-randy-harmelink", "userReview": "Ever since reading the first book, Voyage of the Dead, I have anxiously been awaiting this second book in the series. It did NOT disappoint. Check that -- I WAS disappointed when I ran out of book to read. I was engrossed from start to finish. Once again, I was up into the wee hours of the morning to finish the book.As with the first book, I was fascinated with the two main characters. Both Scott can Carl are the type of men I would hope I would be if such a situation as a Zombie Apocalypse were to arise. Not only are they ethical men, but they put a lot of thought behind their plans and actions.I think David weaves an excellent balance between dialog, description, and action. And I enjoy the bantering that frequently occurs between the main characters."}, {"userName": "Cheveyo", "userReviewDate": "Jun 26, 2012", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/5288540-cheveyo", "userReview": "I'm a simple man. so all I really need in life is a good horse, a good saddle and a good book. I got the horse, I got the saddle, and now by golly, I got the book. This is an outstanding Zombie series that just keeps getting better, and I've read alot of Zombie books. Mr. Forsyth is a superb story teller. I don't usually dream about books, but I dreamed about this one 2 nights running. It's just one of those books I didn't want to end (thank God there's a 3rd one coming). Scott is a GREAT man, a giant amongst men. And Carl is so damn tough the man still has the bark on. I'd ride the river with either one of these gentlemen any damn day of the year!I can't give these books enough praise. Keep em comming Mr. Forsyth, your a Master."}, {"userName": "Martin Belcher", "userReviewDate": "Jul 11, 2012", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/5636083-martin-belcher", "userReview": "WOW! I can't get enough of the Sovereign Spirit saga, this is just incredible Zombie fiction with that added extra. Book two \"Flotilla of the Dead\" picks up immediately after \"Voyage of the Dead\" and does not let up in the story line, it just gets better and better and just when you think everything seems to be going well....something happens to make you think \"oh god\" what are they going to do now? I'm just so glad I found these books by accident. A brilliant read and well worth the money and highly recommended. I'm just itching to read Book three \"Deluge of the Dead\" hope it's not too long in coming...."}, {"userName": "Jimmy Hall", "userReviewDate": "Jun 29, 2015", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/2762000-jimmy-hall", "userReview": "I honestly couldn't finish it. I mean the bit with the TV interview? How the hell is this guy meant to be charismatic? Why is almost every other person in a position of authority an idiot? Nonsense.

It's embarrassing for the author."}, {"userName": "Heather Lynn", "userReviewDate": "May 31, 2012", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/8028481-heather-lynn", "userReview": "Damnit, this is why I didn't want to finish the book because now I'm aching to know what happens, and I have nothing else to read to distract me of my suffering. I give it five stars. It's just as good, if not better than Voyage. I don't know if it's just that I have an active imagination, but from the beginning of Voyage I was able to foresee where Flotilla would be headed. I was glad that I was correct, but also still surprised at events that I had not expected.Scott is such a badass leader, which I love. His character is kind, sympathetic, and loving, but at the same time he knows how to stand up for himself and his followers. His confrontations with outsiders, especially government officials, were hilarious and uncomfortable. He always knows exactly what to say and when to say it. So, I guess now I'm wondering what his major character flaw is. His sympathy might get the better of him, but I just can't really see him failing at this point unless he gets killed, which would piss everyone off. Looking into the future of the story, I'll keep my thoughts about what will probably happen to myself, but I'm anxious to know what ends up happening to Clint.This book was a little slower for me than the first, however it was still so gripping. I love the story, all of the characters, the idea, and the author. I have recommended this over and over again to friends, who love zombies as much as I do. It's also gotten to the point where I'm having badass zombie dreams after reading at night, and I love it when a good book isn't ready to let go of my mind even when I have finished reading it. These are books I will revisit over and over again."}, {"userName": "Just My Bucking Book Blog", "userReviewDate": "Jun 04, 2012", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/6889136-just-my-bucking-book-blog", "userReview": "Really, really loved this book and the previous one.Carl is my favourite by far, poor dude didn't have it as handy as Scott in the two books and had to kick more Zombie one on one ass which was awesome.The detail as usual was wicked! How awesome would it be to have being on that ship with Scott and all those weapons, might as well have being on the moon.The only thing I didn't like was how sexist things where. Everything was all about the males, all the women seemed to be helpless, scared or a zombie. A bad ass woman would have made the book but I still give it five stars because I loved it."}, {"userName": "Emily Hanna", "userReviewDate": "Aug 27, 2012", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/11450896-emily-hanna", "userReview": "I loved book one in his series and could wait to get my hands on this one.

Once I picked them up, you couldn't tear me away! Let's get real, I bet this series makes each of you muse over what you would spend your hundreds of millions on should you ever hit the megabucks. The plot is straightforward. Scott, a family man, hits the lottery in a big way. You know boys and their toys. He purchases an old cruise liner and retrofits it to be the ultimate party boat. We're talking helicopters, planes, amphibious watercraft, a cache of weapons; the Sovereign Spirit has it all. On a pleasure cruise with his family and friends, the crew finds themselves in the middle of the zombie apocalypse.The Sovereign spirit is more a tale of survival than death and destruction, oh don't get me wrong, there is still plenty of death and destruction. However, it plays second fiddle to our characters battle to survive and thrive in a world gone dead. Each book can be read standalone, or in succession. Individually they tell a complete battle, together they show us the entire war.I suspect the male gender will really enjoy reading about Scott and his taking charge of creating safe zones and leading the flotilla of boats that travel in the wake of the Sovereign Spirit. For me, I connected with Carl and his struggles, and perseverance. Carl had a depth of character that I didn't find in the other survivors. My only criticism would be that the female characters left me lacking. In this day and age, women just aren't that fragile and docile. I would have liked to see some girl power gracing the pages. I also had difficulty with the crew continuing to work. I just got back from a cruise, and I know the waitstaff, stewards, and other employees would have revolted. Personally, I would have given a big F-Off to my boss and demanded everyone clean their own rooms.From what I hear, these 3 books are just the first installment, and there is more to come in the Sovereign Spirit Saga...The saga continues mwuhahaha.Can we just talk about David Forsyth for a minute? This guy is awesome! He is keen to the fact that in order to keep a buzz going, you must remain relevant. I see him on nearly every blog or group I frequent. I respect that tenacity. That's a guy who's gonna make it. Writers, take note. If you don't sell yourself and put yourself out there, no one else will. Pay attention to this guy. He's got the goods!Click here to read my entire review"}, {"userName": "Sheldon", "userReviewDate": "Jul 25, 2016", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/31018760-sheldon", "userReview": "The best way to describe this story is to imagine that the first 30 minutes of Jurassic Park went on for two hours, then the only one to die was the lawyer. Then the credits rolled. Excited for a sequel? Me neither. I quite liked the first book but there's a total void of any conflict; a basic concept they tell you in any script writing 101 course. The main character continues to be insufferably intelligent and over charismatic, with a guaranteed way out of any situation that arises, any conflict Mr Moneybags has with other antagonists are resolved when they simply come around to his way of thinking after a monologue or two. Any undead are despatched quickly and efficiently with minimum fuss. The safe haven that we get to hear about in great length does sound great place in any apocalypse, but does not make interesting reading. And that\u2019s not to say that there is any fault with the writing itself; it's much more competent than most self-published Kindle reads across any genre (though I don\u2019t feel like I really know any of the small cast of characters much more than I did from book one) but the details are simply not interesting enough to sustain interest. Maybe I'll get around to book 3 once I've had some time away from this. Otherwise I'd recommend the Spanish 'Apocalypse Z' series to anyone after a piece of zombie fiction; smarter and 115% more conflict."}, {"userName": "Hakan", "userReviewDate": "May 18, 2012", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/3389422-hakan", "userReview": "Actually, I did like the previous book a bit more.On one hand, I wanted to read a zombie book and what I got was a book about a politician who needs to describe his plans for a rebuild of civilization about five dozen times in the space of only 250 pages. It really gets repetitive. I understand that political leaders need to repeat their vision to each and every newcomer time and time again, but me, reading a story, it gets really tiring.On the other, there was Carl, now that guy I loved. He is in the same position, but does not have all toys, bells and whistles he could dream of available to him so he has to make do with what he can find and with the main thing the zombies want from him... His BRAIIIIIIINZZZZ :-)So, if the next story would be told from a more Carlish point of view, it would be a sure buy for me. But more Scott?

This book settles into more of a political style with a great deal of the book taken up with the consolidation of the survivors armada and the growth of the main character as a leader. The logistics of feeding the survivors and assisting others are etched out in detail. There is still some awesome zombie fed action but not as much as I would have liked.
